A study of online conversations finds that voters in the large, diverse county are discussing issues differently from those in other parts of Florida.\n                \n                    \n                    Lynne Sladky/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Voting stickers at the Miami-Dade County elections office on Oct. 10. A study of online conversations finds that voters in the large, diverse county are discussing issues differently from those in other parts of Florida. Last week, we discussed state-by-state differences in online conversations around the issue of unemployment. That analysis of millions of words from news posts, blogs and user comments showed how the conversation in the swing states of Florida, Ohio and Virginia varies greatly because of cultural and socioeconomic factors. Dante Chinni is the director of Patchwork Nation, which uses demographic, voting and cultural data to study communities. It is part of the nonpartisan, not-for-profit Jefferson Institute, which teamed with NPR to examine what can be learned about different communities through online text analysis. The project had Knight Foundation funding. But we also found big differences within the same state \u2014 Florida \u2014 over how people talk about the biggest issue of the 2012 campaign. This kind of information could be important to President Obama and Mitt Romney in how they shape their messages while visiting the state and in advertisements. But it's not clear that they're tailoring their messages to take advantage of this kind of distinction. We looked at the online \"unemployment\" conversations in two very different Florida counties: Citrus, a growing but still not densely populated county near the state's Interstate 4 corridor; and Miami-Dade, the bustling, diverse, cosmopolitan metropolis that is home to Miami in the state's tip. Miami-Dade and Citrus shared the exact same unemployment rate this summer: 10.3 percent. But the conversations around that issue were strikingly different. In Miami-Dade, the conversation looks to be about the broader reasons for and political aspects of unemployment. In Citrus, the discussion is less policy-based. It is much more about the area, its residents and families. What's the significance? Well, Miami-Dade and Citrus are likely to vote in very different ways in November: They did four years ago when Barack Obama captured 58 percent of the vote in Miami-Dade, and 41 percent in Citrus. Some Romney supporters wonder how the Republican presidential nominee is not running away with an election that is shaping up to be about a struggling economy. Romney's business background and position as challenger in hard economic times should be pushing him ahead. These conversations in Miami-Dade and Citrus show Romney's followers may be missing a key point: Having everyone talking about the right topic is not enough. Even if everyone is \"talking about the same thing,\" the ways they are talking about it are very different \u2014 and those differences are even more important. Below are more details about the study (and follow this link for methodology and graphics): Miami-Dade County The conversation about unemployment over the past 18 months in Miami-Dade has focused on the big picture. The most common word in all of the posts about unemployment was \"Florida,\" appearing in about three-quarters of the posts. That may sound obvious, but the word appeared in only about half of the posts in Citrus County. Why? When you look at the other top words in Miami around unemployment, you get a sense of a conversation about state government, politics and the larger macroeconomic environment. Florida Gov. Rick Scott's last name was popular in Miami-Dade, appearing in roughly one-third of the posts, compared with roughly one-tenth of the posts in Citrus. The same is true for \"Obama,\" which appeared in 30 percent of the Miami-Dade posts, but 20 percent of the posts from Citrus. Former Florida Gov. Charlie Crist's name popped up in a quarter of all of the Miami-Dade posts, but did not appear in Citrus. It's not clear without a lot more analysis whether \"Scott,\" \"Obama\" and \"Crist\" were tied to positive or negative mentions. But what is clear is the effort to tie the concept of unemployment to larger political forces. Some of the strongest evidence comes from a few words with a very international perspective: \"China\" and \"India.\" Those words appeared in almost 8 percent of the posts in Miami-Dade. They did not appear at all in posts from Citrus. Miami-Dade, a county of 2.3 million people, has many more college graduates, a much higher median household income and a much more international focus in general. And those county-level differences make for a very different understanding of the issue. The Jefferson Institute has studied the differences in the United States at the county level with Patchwork Nation, a demographic/geographic breakdown that puts counties into 12 different types. Miami-Dade is one of the country's biggest, most diverse counties. It is classified as an Immigration Nation community in Patchwork Nation, with stark differences from Citrus, which sits in the middle of the state on the Gulf Coast. Citrus County Some 270 miles up the Florida turnpike, the conversation about unemployment in Citrus reflects the place it is from: smaller in scale in some ways, less policy-driven and more personal. That more local focus may be most easily seen through the top word used: \"Citrus.\" While the people in Miami-Dade were talking about \"Florida\" in relation to unemployment, in Citrus they most often used the words associated with \"county.\" The word \"Citrus\" also played a big role, appearing in more than two-thirds of all posts from the county. In Miami-Dade, \"Miami\" was used much less often \u2014 in less than one-fifth of all posts. Beyond simple geography, the unemployment conversation in Citrus was also more built around personal words \u2014 words connected to loved ones and faith. Forms of the word \"family\" appeared in 31 percent of the posts in Citrus, compared with just 15 percent in Miami-Dade. The word \"children\" appeared in 18 percent of the posts in Citrus; less than 4 percent in Miami-Dade. Maybe most revealing, \"God\" appeared in 10 percent of the posts from Citrus and 4 percent of the posts from Miami-Dade. In some ways, it could be argued that \"God\" is an extremely personal word to be tied to unemployment; in other ways, it might be seen as the ultimate in broadening the conversation. But the conversation is not surprising when you consider the makeup of Citrus County. North of Tampa, Citrus is a collection of fairly homogenous small towns \u2014 95 percent white \u2014 and it has twice the proportion of Evangelical Christians as Miami-Dade. Faith, particularly evangelical faith, is a big part of the area. Add in an older population, lower incomes and fewer college degrees, and it only stands to reason that you would have a different conversation about unemployment. A county-by-county comparison of the state, through the lens of Patchwork Nation.  Miami-Dade is in the far southeast corner of the state; Citrus is on the northwest coast of the peninsula.",

Mitt Romney has gotten into political hot water for asserting that \"47 percent of the people\" favor President Obama because they are \"dependent upon government.\" But while 47 percent or more Americans support Obama in the November election and roughly 47 percent pay no net federal income taxes, they aren't the same 47 percent. \"A significant number of voters for both candidates are people who are not paying taxes,\" says Scott Keeter, a pollster with the Pew Research Center. \"It's not at all the case that Obama's supporters don't and Romney's supporters do.\" It's already been widely pointed out that a good deal of Romney's support comes from seniors who aren't paying federal income taxes. But Obama does hold a big lead among lower-income voters \u2014 56 to 37 percent, according to Gallup polling conducted over the past month. \"The people who are dependent on government assistance make up a far larger share of Obama's coalition than of Romney's,\" says Whit Ayres, a GOP consultant. Part of that advantage is attributable to Obama's solid support among minorities, who tend to have lower incomes, on average, than whites. He has nearly universal backing among African-Americans and about two-thirds support from Hispanics. But part of Obama's strength in both his presidential runs has been to wed support from ethnic minorities with that of certain segments of the white population, notably union members and college-educated professionals. This time around, he also holds a big lead among unmarried white women. According to Gallup's figures, Obama and Romney are running even, with 47 percent each, among voters who make between $36,000 and $89,999 a year. Among those making more than $90,000, Romney has just a 5 percentage point advantage (50 percent to 45 percent). \"Obama draws considerable strength from people in high socioeconomic status categories,\" says Karlyn Bowman, a polling expert at the American Enterprise Institute. But if the economic circumstances of Obama's coalition is more mixed than Romney's remarks suggest, there are differences in how their supporters view the economy. New polling from both Pew and Gallup shows that Democrats are much more positive about the economy than Republicans.",

David Kenner is an associate editor at Foreign Policy. Amr Moussa stood on a rickety stage, battling the summer heat and feedback from a defective microphone, promising the Egyptian people the world. \"We're making a Second Republic, a renaissance for Egypt,\" he told the audience of several hundred. \"It is the time to rebuild the country, to fight poverty and unemployment, which has resulted from mismanagement.\" He went on in that vein, ticking off the boxes of socioeconomic development: health care, education, wages. Children played with posters featuring the visage of the former Egyptian foreign minister and Arab League secretary-general and a simple message: \"Create jobs.\" It was the spectacle, not the speech, that counted. Moussa's campaign bus had been joined by a convoy of honking cars as it entered the town; a makeshift band played on the back of one pickup truck. Moussa's first stop was to the town's mosques, where he prayed briefly among the crush of locals trying to get close to him. Outside one mosque, the crowd thronged around the door in anticipation of his exit, cheering expectantly. A man from the town exited before Moussa and waved to the masses. \"Thank you, thank you,\" he joked. \"Yes, I am the prime minister.\" It was just one stop in a frenetic campaign that has taken Moussa to seemingly every village and hamlet in Egypt. The night before, Moussa had taken part in Egypt's first-ever presidential debate, which concluded after 2 a.m. His campaign bus left Cairo at 9 a.m., and he was still shaking hands and kissing babies 12 hours later. \"He's like the Energizer Bunny,\" said Ahmed Kamel, his exhausted media advisor, at the end of the day. Beni Suef, a predominantly rural governorate of approximately 2.6 million people south of Cairo, appeared at first glance to be a strange place for Moussa to stump for votes. It is the home of Muslim Brotherhood Supreme Guide Mohammed Badie and has by and large stood behind his political vision. In Egypt's most recent parliamentary elections, the Brotherhood's political wing won a majority of the votes in the governorate, followed closely by the Salafi al-Nour Party. But there was Moussa \u2014 an emphatically non-Islamist candidate and a consummate establishment man in a country supposedly in revolution \u2014 barnstorming across the governorate. And it is working: Moussa remains the front-runner in the presidential race set to kick off on May 23. A recent poll released by the Al-Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies, a government-linked think tank, placed him at the top of the heap, garnering the support of 31.7 percent of voters, while a Brookings Institution poll had him a close second behind Islamist candidate Abdel Moneim Aboul Fotouh. If none of the candidates wins more than 50 percent of the vote, the election will move to a runoff between the top two vote-getters on June 16 and 17, where Moussa would likely be in the strongest position to forge a winning coalition. But what does Moussa's success say about the state of Egypt's politics? The word \"revolution\" has been thrown about for the past 16 months to describe the upheaval in the country; a victory by the 75-year-old veteran of internecine battles within Hosni Mubarak's regime and the old Arab order suggests something closer to a course correction. Moussa, for better or worse, is not the culmination of anything approaching a revolution. Many Egyptians recognize this, and resent it. Dissenters trail the crowds of cheering supporters at Moussa's every campaign stop. His earnest speech in Beni Suef was interrupted when a youth of no more than 20 burst into the tent to denounce him as felool \u2014 a derogatory term for \"remnants\" of the old regime. Mahmoud, who would only give his first name, was wearing a violet T-shirt featuring an image of a skull adorned with a top hat and holding a rose between its teeth. The words \"King of Kings\" ran below the skull. \"He's a member of the old regime; he will reproduce the old tyranny,\" he said outside the rally, after being ushered out. \"He will never change things. He will steal from us like they did. He never did anything at the Arab League.\" \"Who among us here would vote for Amr Moussa?\" he yelled to the crowd of young men who had assembled around him outside, trying to rally support. The crowd stared at him quietly, in trepidation. Egypt's broken transition to democracy, however, has caused many to answer Mahmoud's rhetorical question in the affirmative. Violent protests have racked the country since Mubarak's fall, threatening Egyptians' sense of security and bolstering support for law-and-order candidates. Meanwhile, the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, the ruling military junta, has pledged to unilaterally amend the Egyptian Constitution before the presidential poll, bypassing the elected parliament. In this chaotic environment, Egyptians have looked to candidates who would restore the basics of governance before those who represent an embodiment of last year's revolution. It's not only Moussa who has benefited from this dynamic. Mubarak's last prime minister, Ahmed Shafiq, has surged ahead in the polls, going from also-ran to legitimate contender. And Omar Suleiman, Mubarak's former intelligence chief, quickly jumped to the top of polls in April after throwing his hat in the race (he was later disqualified) \u2014 a fact attributed to his skill at bringing security, if not democracy. \"If you had to sketch out an ideal transition, you probably wouldn't have the military taking over and then the prime minister of the previous regime running for president,\" said Nabil Fahmy, the dean of American University in Cairo's School of Public Affairs and a former ambassador to the United States, referring to Shafiq. \"But this is where we are.\" In the absence of a political road map, Moussa has touted his ability to serve as a bridge between the old regime and the hoped-for democracy. He has pledged to serve only one term and to appoint a vice president who would represent the youth. Once he sets the country on the right path, the pitch goes, he will pass power to a new generation of Egyptian leaders. Moussa has also tried to remake himself as a critic of Mubarak, whom he pledged to vote for before the revolution. \"The road was not easy with President Mubarak at junctures,\" he said shortly after announcing his intention to run for president. In a recent interview, he also made the case that the decline of Mubarak's government began around 2005, when \"every day it was getting worse\" \u2014 an effort to draw a distinction from the final years of the regime and his tenure there. Mubarak did eventually kick Moussa up to the toothless Arab League when the tensions between the two \u2014 largely over how hard to push their Israeli interlocutors \u2014 became too great. \"It was only a matter of time,\" said Fahmy, who served as Moussa's political advisor in the Foreign Ministry for seven years. \"It was like two players playing different tunes. Mubarak was more concerned with domestic issues and wanted Moussa to tone it down. But that wasn't who he was.\" \"Omar Suleiman, Ahmed Shafiq, and Amr Moussa have never been considered part of the corruption side of the Mubarak regime. But they were not vocal on the issue of reform, no matter what they say,\" said Abdel Moneim Said, president of the Al-Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies and a member of the former ruling party's Policies Committee. \"I was there, and I never really found one of them saying what's going on is wrong.\" \"I saw him a lot of times after he left the Foreign Ministry, very close with Mubarak on a human basis,\" Said continued. \"There were some differences at some times.... But I think the difference between Mubarak and Amr Moussa was quantitative \u2014 it was not qualitative.\" Moussa's strategy for rebutting the felool charge is to present himself as an experienced statesman. His decade-long tenure as foreign minister, from 1991 to 2001, earned praise from Egyptians for the aggressive manner in which he stood up to Israel, particularly in a debate with then Israeli Foreign Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami. To this day, the release of a schlocky pop song titled \"I Hate Israel and I Love Amr Moussa\" is seen as the moment when Mubarak became leery of Moussa's growing popularity and resolved to remove him from the Foreign Ministry. \"[He] was good in two parts of diplomacy,\" Said noted of Moussa's tenure. \"Being nice and reconciling \u2014 and at the same time he can be a son of a b- - -h of the first order. He can be tough.\" The record bears that out. One of the defining political moments of Moussa's career came during the 2000 Camp David summit, which ended in failure after Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat could not reach a settlement on the core issues of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. During that time, Moussa repeatedly and publicly batted away American requests to pressure the Palestinians to reach an agreement. \"Are we supposed to pressure President Arafat to make concessions on Jerusalem?\" he asked. \"This is not our job.\" Like Arafat, Moussa proved willing to walk away from the talks, the failure of which paved the way for the Second Intifada. \"Let me put it this way: If there is no deal, the fallout will be bad; in the case of a bad deal, the ramifications will be worse,\" he said as the talks were ongoing. But Moussa is no irreconcilable foe of Israel. As with all other issues, he bobs and weaves, positioning himself for the best possible deal. During a massive campaign rally, he made headlines when he declared the 1978 Camp David Accords \"dead and buried,\" saying there is \"no such thing\" as the agreement. The line bolstered his reputation among anti-Israel Egyptians, but few noted that Moussa's claim was technically true \u2014 it's the 1979 Egypt-Israel peace treaty that officially defines the relationship between the two states. And fewer still dwelled on what Moussa said next: \"There is an agreement between Israel and Egypt that we will honor as long as Israel honors it.\" Moussa has also proved himself capable of having functional, even friendly, relationships with top Israeli officials. Israeli President Shimon Peres once recounted the then foreign minister's attempt to get a look at the site of Israel's suspected nuclear weapons program: \"You know, once Amr Moussa ... asked me: 'Shimon, we are good friends; why don't you take me to Dimona and let me have a look at what's going on there?'\" (Peres politely demurred.) Moussa's campaign has released an 86-page political program that lays out technocratic, good-government solutions to everything from Egypt's widespread poverty to deficits in the pension system to the stagnation in the agricultural sector. It is his past, however, that offers a clearer preview of his prospective presidential administration: He would try to cut deals with Egypt's diverse poles of power in an attempt to reconsolidate the fractured Egyptian state. He would try to be the leader who went to Tahrir Square during the revolution and the one who says the Egyptian military \"has been in charge for 60 years \u2014 you can't just lock them out and say goodbye.\" It will be no easy task. Egypt's next president will be forced to balance the interests of a powerful military establishment with that of an Islamist-dominated parliament, all the while meeting the Egyptian people's sky-high hopes for economic development. If Moussa succeeds at restoring stability to the Egyptian state, it will be the magnum opus of an official who has spent a career perfecting the art of political compromise. Just don't call it a revolution.",

            "article_content": "At my request, NPR has released more information than any mainstream media organization on the diversity of its editorial staff and audience. My analysis two weeks ago turned on the question of which baseline to use in measuring progress. Now I have asked six national leaders and experts of different views what they think of how NPR is doing. They responded with great insight, some frustration and dollops of humor. The goal is for NPR to sound like America. Summary charts are below. The shame is that commercial newspapers, television and radio don't give out the same detail. Participants:  Paul Delaney, The Root Contributor, Former NPR Board Member Too many Americans cannot acknowledge that the country has serious race problems. Progress in diversity is still not sustainable. Read response. U.S. Rep. Mike Honda, Democrat-California Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders are the fastest growing ethnic group. Yet too often the portrayal and coverage of them is insufficient. Read response. Rhonda Levaldo, President, Native American Journalists Association When tribal nations are ignored in demographic stories, newsrooms indirectly report native people do not matter. Read response. Janet Murgu\u00eda, President and CEO, National Council of La Raza Being able to count the number of Hispanic journalists on two hands, instead of one, does not give NPR a whole lot of bragging rights. Read response. Charles Murray, W.H. Brady Scholar, American Enterprise Institute NPR's staff is part of the new upper class isolated from the mainstream. Here is a staff questionnaire as another way to measure diversity. Read response. Michael Schudson, Sociology Professor, Columbia Journalism School NPR is doing better than the average newsroom, but who knew that a third of NPR's 'elite' audience doesn't have a college degree?  Read response. This first chart summarizes the staff composition against four baselines: the entire U.S. population, the population over 18, college graduates in the U.S. and NPR's audience. The baselines represent America and target and actual audiences. One of the measures\u2014college graduates\u2014also represents the hiring pool for journalists. The breakdown of the actual audience is a subject for debate and treated in my earlier column. The other charts below show diversity at different employee and management levels. Retention is not addressed.

My quick answer is, too many Americans cannot acknowledge that the country has serious race problems. Fortunately, the premier radio media company, National Public Radio, seems to be taking the issue more seriously than most of its counterparts in the rest of the media world, print and television included, but especially new media, which seems to be totally tone deaf. The dearth of interest in internal racial matters and real action by the rest makes NPR's effort look even better, as noted in a report on diversity by the network's ombudsman. As an NPR board member for eight years, I was always struck by the lack of in-depth consideration of racial issues, when the nomenclature shifted from integration and desegregation to affirmative action and now diversity - the nation cannot even agree on what to call it in attempting to skirt dealing with it. The end of each regular board meeting included a report on diversity, usually a gentle pat on the back for how well the company was doing, or at least what it was hoping to accomplish. Those meetings tackled the headier matters of pricing structure, content, public service announcements, low-power stations, advent of satellite radio, live streaming and the internet, as new technologies forced themselves on unsuspecting old media. The board was advised by experts to be ready to confront rapidly changing times regarding minorities, youth and international audiences. The feeble solutions (to my mind) were to lure Tavis Smiley to NPR (a failure) and establish a minority stations council (still a work in progress), as well as hire Michel Martin (a success) and bring on a few more nonwhites (wholly inadequate) as minorities came and went in a seemingly revolving-door game. What the decent-looking current statistics do not show is the dearth of deeper involvement, particularly in management. When I joined the board, NPR's president, Delano Lewis, was black (the Obama of his day) but the numbers of nonwhite managers has veered from poor to worse since. How important is that? I do not believe there is any question that when matters of content and coverage come up in newsroom planning sessions, the presence of people of color makes a tremendous difference. Think Trayvon Martin and border and immigration issues and the Sahel and Iran, Afghanistan, even the elections in France. From my time on the board, I vividly recall the statement of one manager regarding NPR: \"Our future is how brilliantly we do things, not channels of distribution, not how cheaply we do things.\" Unfortunately, no genius in any newsroom has yet been able to take such findings as those of NPR's ombudsman and make diversity real and sustainable. Paul Delaney is a contributor to The Root. He was formerly an NPR board member, a reporter and editor for the New York Times and chairman of the journalism department at the University of Alabama. [Back to the top]   Mike Honda The results from NPR's internal employment diversity study are an encouraging sign for the Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) community, who are the nation's fastest-growing minority yet remain underrepresented in most media outlets. For the last four decades, NPR has provided quality, unbiased programming, covering breaking local, national, and international news, music, trivia, the arts, and more. I commend Ombudsman Edward Schumacher-Matos for taking the initiative to examine diversity within NPR reporting and management staff and congratulate him for being NPR's first Latino ombudsman. Although coverage and portrayals of AAPIs have too often been insufficient and inaccurate, NPR has proven to be a strong leader in staff diversity and representation of AAPIs. AAPI journalists and management offer a unique perspective on the stories NPR covers and shares, further enriching the NPR audience and strongly reflecting the core American values of civil rights and freedom of speech. Journalism is a powerful mechanism for informing public opinion and must be held to the highest standard by including a variety of voices and opinions. As Chair Emeritus of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, I have worked hard to expand AAPI representation and diversity in the media. One of my proudest accomplishments was working with Comcast and NBC Universal to negotiate a memorandum of understanding with the AAPI community to increase investments in AAPI programming as well as diversity in the corporate workforce and on camera. I am hopeful that other local and national media outlets over time will continue to recruit and retain members of the AAPI community to more accurately reflect the communities that they serve. As the ethnic demographic of the United States continues to change, new staff and coverage should reflect the racial diversity and core values of our country. We must hold true to our prized principles of civil rights and freedom of speech and the press. This includes through equal opportunity employment in journalism. Minorities comprise 28 percent of the total US population and 23 percent of NPR's staff. Needless to say, NPR has had a great record of employing a diverse group of reporters and managers. Therefore, I hope NPR will continue to reflect on this trend and broaden the demographic of their staff. Mike Honda is the U.S. representative for California's 15th congressional district. [Back to the top]   Rhonda Levaldo The baselines for measuring audience diversity is important for many mainstream news outlets because it gives the producers/reporters an idea of what new ideas they can be covering and how they can report on it.  A representation of the national census therefore should be used so all minorities are included. With an understanding of who is listening, reading or watching the news, newsrooms can increase content that is reflective of the American public. For the Native American audience, most of \"Native\" radio programming is on community-based stations and many of native people listen to what is on National Public Radio (NPR). When the recent survey was posted about who listens to NPR, the Native American statistic was not on the story sent out across newsrooms. When tribal nations are ignored in demographic stories, newsrooms indirectly report native people do not matter, native people do not exist, perpetuate the 19th century racial stereotype of the Vanishing Indian. The Native American Journalists Association (NAJA) is always open to assist with stories on Native peoples. Greater newsroom diversity increases the chance of readers understanding an issue they may not have even thought about before. For example, many in the public do not know that Native people are not all alike, that they don't have the same language or customs. Many do not even know that they are sovereign nations. With increased coverage on just one group like Native Americans, people could instead find not the Vanishing Indian, but citizens consolidating around Native Nations on the Keystone XL pipeline, how Congressional decisions immediately impact Native Nations, and how often Native political leaders talk about which presidential candidate will do less damage to their tribal sovereignty. The NAJA goal is increasing newsroom inclusion. Reporting on Native Nations beyond a powwow provides the public what is happening in their own backyards. Excluding different races, creeds or sexual orientations turns a blind eye to the general public's interests, opinions, and growth of their ideas. I encourage NPR to keep building a database of story ideas nationally and locally. With the current census information coming out, stories on diversity issues impact the listening audience by reporting an issue exists or by informing an issue is not as simple as previously thought. NAJA is always willing to help mainstream news outlets in find contacts and reporters. We want these stories to be told, we need the general population to see that Native Americans are still here and what we are doing.

[Back to the top]   Janet Murgu\u00eda A couple of observations about this chart: First I would note the continued severe underrepresentation of Latinos among NPR journalists and producers. It's true that there has been some improvement. But being able to count the number of correspondents and producers on two hands, instead of one \u2014 which was the case when NCLR first looked at these numbers nearly 20 years ago \u2014 does not give NPR a whole lot of bragging rights. I would also note with alarm the dearth of Latino representation within NPR's management. It is very troubling that, after raising this issue with NPR for many years and through many efforts such as the National Association of Hispanic Journalists' Parity Project, the numbers are still as bleak as they are. There are a couple of rays of hope. First, we appreciate that NPR's ombudsman, Edward Schumacher-Matos, has devoted so much attention to this issue. And we appreciate the courage it takes to have outsiders critique the organization on its own website. Second, it is clear by the longevity of the handful of Latino correspondents at NPR \u2013 venerable names in our community such as Mandalit del Barco, Richard Gonzales, Maria Hinojosa, and Claudio Sanchez \u2013 that NPR seems to be a supportive environment for good journalism. Perhaps the careers of these revered journalists can serve as role models for potential NPR journalists in the future. Second, the question of how NPR should measure its responsiveness is an interesting one. Should NPR focus on appealing to its core audience, as most commercial broadcasters do, or does it have a broader mission to serve the public, given its unique role in American media? I would argue that focusing on just serving college graduates underestimates the appeal and value of NPR's programming to the Latino community. NPR is one of the few outlets that consistently and fairly covers the issues Latinos care about most. NPR is producing content that should, and needs to be, heard by our community. I firmly believe that NPR can grow its Latino audience with a concerted outreach effort and with the addition of more people familiar with how to reach and speak to America's fastest growing population. An effort of this kind is much-needed and much too long overdue. Janet Murgu\u00eda is the President and CEO, National Council of La Raza. [Back to the top]   Charles Murray I don't have anything interesting to say about the chart. It's a good thing to have ethnic diversity, ceteris paribus, and NPR has it, mirroring the national population with remarkable fidelity except for underrepresentation of Latinos. But I think the crucial consideration in journalism is that the journalist be fluent in whatever language is being spoken for a given story. If you're doing a story on evangelical Christians, you don't have to be an evangelical Christian--don't even need to be Christian--but you have to be culturally literate about evangelical Christians (which requires more than reading a few clips of other stories about evangelical Christians written by other people who don't speak the language). You have to understand the sense of what the person is saying. I don't just mean be able to empathize, though that's a bonus, but literally to be able to _understand_ what the person is saying. That's much more important (I think) than that the evangelical and you are the same ethnicity. By the same logic, I am not much impressed if a black journalist is assigned to cover a story about, say, black baggage handlers, if the black journalist grew up in Winnetka, went to Dartmouth, and has never held a job that caused a body part to hurt at the end of the day. When I inveigh against a new upper class that is ignorant of, and isolated from, mainstream America, as I do at length in \"Coming Apart,\" NPR's staff was pretty much what I had in mind\u2014or my conception of NPR's staff. So prove me wrong. Poll your staff on the following types of diversity. \"Yes\" answers are the ones I don't expect from NPR staff. Religious. Do you attend a worship service regularly\u2014meaning weekly, unless something unusual prevents you? Political. Do you openly identify yourself as conservative or libertarian? Lifestyle. Give yourself an overall \"yes\" if you can answer \"yes\" to at least three of these four questions. 1. When ordering a drink in a bar, do you routinely order something alcoholic other than wine or a boutique beer? (Campari with soda doesn't count.) 2. Do you relish a big steak? 3. Do you go for weeks at a time without exercising? 4. Can you name at least four series on commercial TV that you watch regularly? Socioeconomic status. Give yourself an overall \"yes\" if you can answer \"yes\" to three of these four questions. 1. Have you ever lived for at least a year in an American neighborhood in which the majority of your fifty nearest neighbors probably did not have college degrees? 2. Did you grow up in a family in which the chief breadwinner was not in a managerial job or a high-prestige profession (defined as attorney, physician, dentist, architect, engineer, scientist, or college professor)? 3. Have you ever lived for at least a year in an American community under 50,000 population that is not part of a metropolitan area and was not where your college was located? 4. Have you ever lived for at least a year in the United States at an income that was close to or below the poverty line? You may answer yes if at any time in your life your family income was below $30,000 in 2010 dollars. Take your best guess. (Being poor in graduate school doesn't count.) What do I expect from your poll? I guess I'd be surprised if you get \"yes\" from over 20 percent of the staff on religion, lifestyle or socioeconomic status. For politics, anything greater than zero would surprise me. In any case, I'd love to know the results.

They are busy covering the news of the community their organization serves. You notice that 80 are male. You notice that all are white except for four African-Americans and one Hispanic. Question: how well does this newsroom serve minorities in their city? You can't answer that without seeing what they produce, but you can make some inferences. You know that most of these reporters will feel conspicuous and uncomfortable in many parts of their city. No doubt the staff makes an effort to cover issues of special importance to minorities and women, but you suspect that it is a mission and not a habit, and that it feels like a kind of foreign correspondence. You know it can be done well or poorly but, in either case, it is done with the handicap of a largely monochromatic newsroom. There are few colleagues to enrich the formal and informal cultural mix of the workplace. This thought-experiment adopts data from a 1971 national newsroom survey. Newsrooms in a 2002 re-study with similar methods found an improved picture, although not as different as optimists of the 1970s hoped \u2013 33 women, not 20; 8 people from racial minorities, not 5 \u2013 with the number of African-Americans still at 4. ASNE data show that for newspapers (as opposed to all news media) the employment of women has held steady at 37% of newsrooms over the past decade; minority employment has been about 12%, growing to close to 14% by 2006, but back to 12% by 2012. NPR does much better with diversity than the \"average\" newsroom. In this way, as in many others, it is one of the great success stories in the news media in the past generation. It does not reach everybody. No surprise, the public radio audience skews affluent and highly educated. Still, more than half of NPR's audience live in households with less than $100K in income and more than a third of listeners do not have a college degree. We're talking about millions of people who do not fit the college-educated, savvy, latte-drinking left-of-center stereotype. I do fit, omitting the latte, and I suspect many NPR staffers do, too, but they serve and must speak to a broader population. How? By doing what they have often done so well. They can serve their listeners by maintaining first-rate news coverage \u2013 by making great use of the evocative capacities of sound \u2014 music, language, and voice; by taking listeners past the beaten track of breaking news to the associated stories no one else is getting at; and by acknowledging that many listeners \u2013 if my own experience is any guide (it may not be) \u2013 are almost never going to go to the Website \"for more details\" on a story they have heard. Why do members of both the latte and non-latte species listen to NPR? One person's experience: because I like waking to radio; because I can't stand commercial interruptions; because not infrequently I have interrupted brushing my teeth and moved from bathroom back to bedroom because NPR's on a story just too interesting not to attend to for 60 seconds more; because it catches me up quickly with \"top stories\" in a way that does not insult my intelligence; because its tone is civil; because Scott Simon is a Cubs fan as is anyone who roots for underdogs. And if you don't root for underdogs, what's wrong with you? Michael Schudson is a professor of sociology at the Columbia School of Journalism.

China has welcomed the auspicious year of the dragon. Yet, this year has not been auspicious for Chinese dissidents. Read Another Opinion On Dissidents In China Sophie Richardson is China director at Human Rights Watch. It's only been a month, and 2012 is already looking bleak for the notion that peaceful criticism can exist within China. In January, a court in the central Chinese city of Wuhan sentenced writer Li Tie to 10 years on charges of subversion of state power, and prosecutors in Hangzhou charged poet Zhu Yufu with subversion for penning a poem about political reform. Prominent dissident Yu Jie, who fled China in January, explained at a press conference in Washington how Beijing policemen beat him for hours and burned him with cigarettes. In late December, a Sichuan court sentenced pro-democracy activist Chen Wei to nine years for subversion; a few days later a court in Guizhou gave government critic Chen Xi ten years on the same charge. Such harsh sentences, meted out to people who had merely exercised their constitutionally guaranteed right of freedom of expression, send an unambiguous warning to critics of the Chinese government to keep silent. China's ruling Communist Party has been treating dissidents with an increasingly heavy hand over the past few years. Fearing a \"Jasmine Revolution\" in the wake of the Arab Spring last year, the government shifted its strategy from just detaining critics to disappearing them. The internationally renowned artist Ai Weiwei was arrested on April 3 and held in an undisclosed location until June 22. In 2009, China sentenced Liu Xiaobo, one of the chief architects of the Charter '08 democracy appeal, to 11 years in prison. When the Nobel committee awarded Liu the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010, China started a campaign of intimidation by arresting, detaining, and intimidating other signatories, and by placing Liu's wife, Liu Xia, under house arrest despite the lack of a legal basis for doing so. And 2009 also saw the government unleash harsh repression in response to unrest in Xinjiang and Tibet. Contrary to the claims of the International Olympic Committee, whose president, Jacques Rogge, saidthat the 2008 Beijing Olympics would improve the Chinese human rights situation, the legacy appears to be the ascendance of the security state, a massive project of surveillance and censorship set in motion to quell any signs of protest around the games \u2014 and which continues unabated to this day. But 2012 will likely be worse. As the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) formally heads into its orchestrated leadership transition in which power will likely transfer from Hu Jintao to Xi Jinping, it will place a higher-than-normal premium on trying to maintain the fa\u00e7ade of a \"harmonious society.\" Concurrently, it faces unprecedented social unrest and demands for justice and accountability coming from all regions and across socioeconomic groups. Because the CCP remains profoundly hostile to free expression and refuses to loosen its tentacled grip on the legal system, it is left pursuing a strategy of \"social management\" that provides only piecemeal relief \u2014 and may well fuel even greater outrage. In early December 2011, the citizens of the fishing village of Wukan, fed up with local Communist Party officials' obfuscation over land sales of dubious legality, began to protest. In a highly unusual role reversal, the officials fled and the people of Wukan governed themselves for two weeks. With the reputation of Guangdong Party Secretary Wang Yang on the line, and with extensive domestic and international media coverage, the local government dispatched mediators, promised to investigate returning some of the land to the villagers, and appointed the protest's leader to the position of village party secretary. But since then, virtually no progress has been made on the land dispute. More problematic is the total failure of an investigation into the suspicious death in custody of one of the protest leaders. Although Wukan has achieved some gains,including an election, those may prove incomplete and reversible; moreover, the state's reaction to the incident betrays little indication that it is now more willing to systematically discuss criticisms. While China's legal system may resemble one that interprets and upholds the law, the reality is that courts, judges, and lawyers answer to the CCP's dictates. To reconcile the growing number of indictments on the grounds of \"endangering state security\" with the lack of armed, organized threats to the Chinese state, it helps to try and understand the government's interpretation of what constitutes a threat. The poet Zhu Yufu got a decade in prison on charges of subversion in part for writing, \"It is time, people of China! It is time...The square belongs to us all; our feet are our own...It is time to use our feet to go to the square and to make a choice...We should use our choices to decide the future of China.\" At a time of unprecedented wealth and power, it is telling that the Chinese government finds such words so threatening. The handful of Chinese lawyers trying to make the rule of law a reality have been targeted for trying to defend cases involving freedom of expression. At least six were disappeared and released in 2011. Equally worrying, the Chinese government \u2014 long a recipient of significant international assistance to promote the rule of law \u2014 has taken steps towards legalizing disappearances. If revisions to the Criminal Procedure Law are adopted as planned in March 2012, police will be entitled to detain for up to six months, at a location of their choice, suspects in alleged cases of \"terrorism\" or \"national security\" \u2014 notoriously vague designations that have often been used against peaceful government critics. Many believe that the Chinese government, flush with cash and confidence, is impervious to criticism. The dozen or so governments that conduct regular human rights dialogues with Beijing issue statements of concern, meet dissidents, and discuss these problems among themselves. While the Chinese government clearly loathes these dialogues, it has for the most part learned to manage them without paying a price for its unrepentant abuses. Indeed, Western governments rarely impose penalties on the Chinese government. Instead, they look to Beijing for cooperation on a host of global diplomatic, security, and environmental issues \u2014 not to mention mutually beneficial trade relationships \u2014 and as such are often wary about overtly promoting the rights of people in China. The United States has in the past year offered up some tough rhetoric on the Chinese government's human rights track record, but it has not publically articulated or imposed a price on Beijing for its abuses. Nor does it coordinate across the government to take full advantage of opportunities to promote rights. The free flow of information, a functional and independent legal system, and the ability of people to peacefully express criticism aren't just the purview of the human rights community \u2014 they are realities that fundamentally underpin economic and security ties as well. Every U.S. Cabinet member could raise a human rights issue when meeting with Chinese officials, but almost none \u2014 with the exception of Attorney General Eric Holder \u2014 have publically done so. So it's time to change the game plan. The United States and other countries should tell the Chinese government that it cannot dictate who its leaders meet. U.S. President Barack Obama should welcome into the White House activists like Yu Jie or Uyghur leader Rebiya Kadeer prior to the visit in February of China's likely next president, Xi Jinping, underscoring the importance of free speech and responsible civil dissent. Such gestures make America's rhetorical commitments to human rights manifest. Governments have to consistently find \u2014 and use \u2014 their voice on rights. Officials from at least two EU member states were passing through Hangzhou when the poet Zhu Yufu's sentence was announced. Neither said a word publicly, missing a perfect opportunity to manifest these countries' stated bedrock commitment to human rights. Perhaps most important, governments need to make the defense of the freedom of expression in China an inescapable topic of all public and private discussions with Chinese officials. Doing so will help offer a degree of protection for individuals and demonstrate a seriousness of purpose that is difficult for Beijing to ignore. In many countries, political transitions entail policy innovation, vigorous debate, and competition for popular support in elections. This will manifestly not be the case in China this year, and some people there will suffer terribly for merely pointing out this reality. Western governments should not be shy in noting the same. Failure to recognize the efforts of those who struggle daily to hold the Chinese government to the letter of the law and to exercise their rights only increases Beijing's sense of entitlement and impunity. It's already been a long year for dissidents in China \u2014 and it's only been a month. Let's not make it worse for them.",

Paul Ryan, R-Wis., discusses Medicare, Medicaid and the federal budget last year, in Kenosha, Wis. Since GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney picked Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin as his running mate, seems all we've been hearing about is Medicare and its future. No surprise, of course: Ryan is the author of the GOP budget plan that would dramatically remake how the health care insurance program for seniors is managed and funded. He also calls for big changes to Medicaid, the insurance program for the poor, including elderly Americans who have exhausted their means. President Obama's health care overhaul legislation also has significant changes in store for Medicare to secure estimated savings of $716 billion over the next decade. And the legislation calls for a broad expansion of Medicaid. And Romney? He has sort of embraced Ryan's plans, calling their proposals \"the same, if not identical.\" He has, however, distanced himself from a part of Ryan's plan: the part that finds Medicare savings over time equal to those embedded in Obama's health care law \u2014 $716 billion. Here's a look at the programs the candidates are selling and their different paths toward reining in the massively expensive and rapidly expanding programs. MEDICARE It's the federal health insurance system for people age 65 or older, certain younger people with disabilities, and people with permanent kidney failure that requires dialysis or a transplant. The system has 47.6 million beneficiaries; in 2009, 9.3 million of those beneficiaries were also eligible for Medicaid. In 2011, Medicare cost the federal government $551 billion. It has four parts: Part A: Hospital insurance that covers inpatient hospital care, as well as skilled nursing facility, hospice and home health care. Part B: Medical insurance that helps cover the cost of health care provider services, outpatient care, durable medical equipment, home health care and some preventive services. Part C: Known as Medicare Advantage, it offers, along with coverage under Part A and Part B, additional health plan options provided by private insurance companies, as well as prescription drug coverage under Part D. Part D: Coverage that helps pay for prescription drug costs, run by Medicare-approved private insurance companies. Mitt Romney writes on a whiteboard as he talks about Medicare during a news conference on Aug. 16 in Greer, S.C.\n                \n                    \n                    Evan Vucci/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Mitt Romney writes on a whiteboard as he talks about Medicare during a news conference on Aug. 16 in Greer, S.C. Why do we keep hearing the amount $716 billion? That number has become the focus of debate about whose Medicare plan would do what in terms of saving money and/or cutting services. It comes from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. The CBO has estimated that if Obama's health care law is repealed, as advocated by Ryan and Romney, Medicare spending would increase by $716 billion between 2013 and 2022. What are the differences between what Ryan and Romney have proposed, and what's in Obama's health care law? Obama: The president's health care law preserves the current Medicare system of guaranteed benefits, and closes the prescription drug \"doughnut hole\" coverage gap that affects some senior citizens. The Obama campaign characterizes the law's $716 billion as savings largely realized by slowing the program's growth with a decade of agreed-to reductions in hospital, private insurance and drug company reimbursement rates; and cutting reimbursements to private Medicare Advantage plans. The private-market Advantage plans were intended to manage or lower the cost of insuring senior citizens through market competition; they ultimately cost more on average than the standard Medicare plan. Obama has asserted that projected savings embedded in the health care law plan would keep Medicare trust fund solvent until 2024; however the legislation uses savings to subsidize health insurance for younger people. Romney: His campaign's most recent statement on the issue read like this, as reported by NBC News: \"A Romney-Ryan administration will restore the funding to Medicare, ensure that no changes are made to the program for those 55 or older, and implement the reforms that they have proposed to strengthen it for future generations.\" Romney has, in the past, supported Ryan's plan. Ryan: Ryan has proposed a system that would go into effect when people now age 55 and younger hit retirement age. For those future senior citizens, Ryan has proposed to remake the current system that provides a guarantee of benefits. Under his plan, the government would issue credit vouchers to eligible recipients. They would purchase their own insurance, using the vouchers to defray the cost. The CBO has estimated that changes proposed in the Ryan plan could push up out-of-pocket insurance costs for an average senior citizen by $6,400; advocates of the plan argue that market forces will drive down insurance costs. The savings estimated in Ryan's plan would be used for tax relief. MEDICAID President Obama said his health care law bolsters Medicare and Medicaid, but the Supreme Court has ruled that states can opt out of some changes to Medicaid.\n                \n                    \n                    Carolyn Kaster/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption President Obama said his health care law bolsters Medicare and Medicaid, but the Supreme Court has ruled that states can opt out of some changes to Medicaid. How does Medicaid work, and how do the candidates compare? The joint federal and state program that cost $389 billion in 2010 helps with medical costs for some people with limited income and resources, people with disabilities, and some families and children. More than 30 percent of the program's spending goes to long-term care, including care for millions of Medicare-eligible senior citizens who have exhausted their resources. The program varies from state to state, but most health care costs are covered if you qualify for both Medicare and Medicaid. Every state operates a Medicaid program for qualified residents, though eligibility rules are different for each state. Most offer coverage for adults with children at some income level. Under Obama's health care overhaul, starting in 2014, most adults under age 65 with individual incomes up to about $15,000 per year will qualify for Medicaid in every state. June's U.S. Supreme Court ruling on the health care law allows states to opt out of this expansion. Obama: Starting in 2014, Obama's health care law would expand eligibility for Medicaid to those below 133 percent of the federal poverty line, which is close to $15,000 for an individual. An estimated 17 million additional Americans by 2019 would be eligible under the expansion. The U.S. Supreme Court, however, has ruled that states can opt out of the expansion requirement without penalty. Romney: Endorses Ryan plan to \"block grant\" Medicaid, and, according to his website, advocates limits on \"federal standards and requirements on both private insurance and Medicaid coverage. Ryan: Would change the way Medicaid is paid for by converting the matching federal payments program to fixed-dollar block grants made directly to states, which can use discretion in spending the money. The CBO has projected a large reduction in payments, resulting in fewer people eligible for the program.",

Romney battle for the hearts and minds of the middle class this election season, there's a huge swath of Americans that are largely ignored. It's the poor, and their ranks are growing. According to a recent survey by The Associated Press, the number of Americans living at or below the poverty line will reach its highest point since President Johnson made his famous declaration of war on poverty in 1964. Close to 16 percent of Americans now live at or below the poverty line. For a family of four, that's $23,000 a year. On top of that, 100 million of us \u2014 1 out of 3 Americans \u2014 manage to survive on a household income barely twice that amount. How is this poverty crisis happening? 'I've Never Seen Anything As Bad As Now' Across the nation, food banks are reporting giant spikes in demand. The food pantry in Webster Springs, W.Va., used to serve 30 families a month just three years ago. Today, 150 families in that county \u2014 of just 9,000 people \u2014 depend on the food pantry run by Catholic Charities. This administration today, here and now, declares unconditional war on poverty in America. I urge this Congress and all Americans to join with me in that effort. President Lyndon B. Johnson, 1964 State of the Union address Webster Springs is a hard-hit area. Two coal mines have closed down there in the past year. The median income is around $20,000. Yet the crisis is also taking place right in our nation's capital. At the Capital Area Food Bank in Washington, D.C., forklifts move huge pallets of food around this giant warehouse. This year, they expect to give out 33 million pounds of food \u2014 a record. Close to 700,000 people in the region are now at risk of going hungry. \"In my lifetime, I've never seen anything as bad as now,\" says Lynn Brantley, who runs the facility. She's been working with food pantries for four decades and describes what's happening today as a hunger crisis. \"It's growing into the middle class.\" Who Is Poor? There is increasing overlap between those who used to be firmly in the middle class and those who are poor. Most Americans who are poor are still white, but that's also changing, says Angela Blackwell, who runs PolicyLink, a research and advocacy organization that focuses on poverty. \"The face of poverty for the nation has changed from being white to being black and Latino,\" she tells weekends on All Things Considered host Guy Raz. \"That's made a difference, too, because when people thought of poverty as being white and elderly there was more general sympathy in the country and more commitment to do something about it.\" It's estimated that the percentage of Americans living in poverty will increase to 15.7 percent this year, the highest in 50 years. \"That shocking statistic really only represents the people who live below the official poverty level,\" Blackwell says. \"But you have twice that number [of] people who are living near poverty.\" Low-Wage Jobs Keep Incomes Low In 1988, President Ronald Reagan delivered a State of the Union address in which he declared that the war on poverty had failed. Now, with the poverty rate in America expected to reach its highest rate since 1965, it looks like Reagan may have been right. My friends, some years ago, the federal government declared war on poverty, and poverty won. Today, the federal government has 59 major welfare programs and spends more than $100 billion a year on them. What has all this money done? President Ronald Reagan, 1988 State of the Union address Not so, says Peter Edelman, a professor at Georgetown University and an expert on poverty, but, he tells Raz, there is a lot to worry about. \"One reason is we're still in a recession,\" Edelman says. \"We've had a change in our economy over the last 40 years that has produced a flood of low-wage jobs.\" One half of all jobs in the U.S. today now pay less than $35,000 a year. Adjusted for inflation, that's one of the lowest rates for American workers in five decades. There's a common perception that somebody who's poor or living below the poverty level is lazy or simply living off government handouts. Edelman says the actual average poor person is working. \"And working as hard as she or he possibly can,\" he says. \"And particularly in the recession, not able to get work or steady work. There are certainly people who make bad choices, but the fundamental question in our economy is the number of people who are doing absolutely everything they can to support their families \u2014 and they just can't make it.\" Some Battles Won, But Threats Loom Back when LBJ declared his war on poverty, being poor looked very different than it does today. Traveling in Mississippi with Robert Kennedy in 1967, Edelman saw children with bloated bellies and sores that wouldn't heal. There was real hunger and real malnutrition. \"The food stamp program is a tremendous success,\" he says. \"But since that time, it turns out that children are the poorest age group in our country because their families \u2014 typically single moms trying to make it \u2014 can't do so because of this flood of low-wage work that we have.\" Many economists say that when the economy does recover, a lot of the jobs that were lost won't be coming back. That suggests the possibility of significantly high unemployment for a long time \u2014 maybe even a permanently large class of Americans who live in poverty. Blackwell says we can act to prevent that future. \"And it's not rocket science.\" \"We know now that by 2018, 45 percent of all jobs in this nation will require at least an associate's degree,\" she says. \"We could invest in the system of training \u2014 particularly focusing on community colleges and preparing people to go to four-year institutions and improving our high school education.\" \"We actually have extraordinary infrastructure in this country, from the manufacturing base we once had,\" she continues. \"We need to retool it, we need to refit it, we need to make sure that it's ready for the kind of advanced manufacturing that we're seeing develop in other countries.\"",

European leaders and global markets expressed relief after Greek conservatives' narrow parliamentary election victory over leftists who had vowed to ditch the tough austerity terms of an international bailout. But the next government will have to deal with a polarized society and with widespread anger at wage and job cutbacks that have targeted the middle class and spared an entrenched political and business elite. The conservative New Democracy party won just under 30 percent of Sunday's vote and now starts talks to find partners to form a new government. Negotiations could be difficult. New Democracy leader Antonis Samaras has already ruled out meeting with Alexis Tsipras, the leader of Syriza, which finished a close second. That leftist party came out of nowhere in just a few weeks, riding a wave of discontent over austerity and political corruption. Syriza had vowed to seek new and less punishing conditions from Greece's European lenders. Even Samaras acknowledges that the bailout terms are too tough and says he wants to renegotiate them. \"We will work together with our partners in Europe in order to supplement the current policy mix with growth enhancement policies,\" he said in his first public post-election statement. \"We are determined to do what it takes and do it fast.\" Contrary to past elections in less economically dire times, there was little celebration Sunday night in Athens by New Democracy supporters. Outside the party's kiosk in Syntagma Square, people milled around, but there were few smiles. Activist Mirton Kiroussi says there's no reason to cheer. \"We are all very concerned about the next day. We are not sure what is going to happen; we just hope,\" she says. Like most Greeks, Kiroussi is angered by more than two years of budget cuts and tax hikes that have brought the Greek economy to a standstill and pushed 30 percent of the population under the poverty line. She now hopes Greece's EU partners will sweeten the medicine. \"This program that we have to stick to is very strict, and it has caused a lot of damage to Greek people,\" she says. \"So we will really demand renegotiation, and we hope they will give us this.\" But many political analysts say the next government is likely to be weak. As one commentator put it, the leftist Syriza \u2014 with the anti-austerity wind in its sails \u2014 will be a powerful opposition force. Greeting his supporters, party leader Alexis Tsipras vowed that Syriza will be present at all developments. And he sent a message to EU leaders who openly intervened in the election campaign, urging Greeks not to vote for the anti-austerity party. \"Today, millions of eyes in the whole Europe are turned here. Brussels knows they can no longer insist on these tough austerity conditions. It's a big conquest that we deliver to the people of Europe,\" Tsipras said. \"The future does not belong to those who terrorize but to those who hope.\" Future developments depend on whether the EU partners are willing to renegotiate, and early signals are not encouraging. Germany has said Greece has to implement the bailout agreement, and concessions are likely to be limited. German officials view Greece's election results as a victory for their austerity-first policies. However, many analysts stress that a majority of Greeks \u2014 55 percent \u2014 voted for parties that oppose the bailout conditions. Greek society remains deeply unsettled. And there's the specter of further social unrest with the unexpected success of the Golden Dawn party, many of whose members express neo-Nazi sympathies. The ultra right-wing party \u2014 which was virtually nonexistent two months ago \u2014 won about 7 percent of the vote and will put 18 deputies in Parliament. New Democracy's success may prove a Pyrrhic victory.",

            "article_content": "Mitt Romney's comment Wednesday about the social safety net has already been boiled down to a quick shorthand: \"I'm not concerned about the very poor.\" It adds to a growing collection of statements that fuel charges that he has, if nothing else, a very tin ear and is an out-of-touch member of the .01 percent. In a CNN interview with Soledad O'Brien, Romney said in part: \"By the way, I'm in this race because I care about Americans. I'm not concerned about the very poor. We have a safety net there. If it needs repair, I'll fix it. I'm not concerned about the very rich. They're doing just fine. I'm concerned about the very heart of America, the 90, 95 percent of Americans who right now are struggling. I'll continue to take that message across the nation.\" While Romney obviously is attempting to appeal to many Republican and independent voters who are 1) middle class, and 2) less likely to be  concerned about poverty than many Democrats, according to polls, his statement is already causing much Internet buzz. The remark comes after he was forced to reveal his bounteous 2010 and 2011 income and relatively low tax rates. And Newt Gingrich and other rivals for the GOP presidential nomination have already attacked Romney for allegedly hurting workers as Bain Capital's chieftain. That makes Romney's new comment  surefire fodder for Democrats. It's a safe $10,000 bet that it will likely figure in numerous Democratic ads when the race between Romney and President Obama is finally joined \u2014 if Romney continues on to be the Republican nominee. But in classic Romney fashion, he immediately hedged his statement by saying that if there were holes in the safety net, he would fix them. So he is concerned about the very poor, after all, only conditionally. The Washington-based Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a non-partisan, left-of-center organization whose expertise on poverty issues is widely respected, indicates that there are definitely holes in the safety net \u2014 and says that the recession and modest recovery have blown open the holes even larger. An excerpt from a recent report: Thirty states have General Assistance programs, which generally serve very poor individuals who do not have minor children, are not disabled enough to qualify for the Supplemental Security Income program (SSI), and are not elderly. ... Only 12 of these states, however, provide any benefits to childless adults who do not have some disability; the others require recipients to be unemployable, generally due to a physical or mental condition. The benefits that these programs provide are extremely modest. In 29 of the 30 states with General Assistance programs, the maximum benefit is below half of the poverty line for an individual. In fact, in most of these states, the maximum benefit falls below one-quarter of the poverty line. Romney's comment was so unusual that CNN's O'Brien asked a follow-up to make sure she understood him correctly. That also gave Romney a chance to revise his remarks if he wanted to. O'BRIEN: \"All right. I know I said last question, but I've got to ask you. You just said, 'I'm not concerned about the very poor because they have a safety net.' And I think there are lots of very poor Americans who are struggling who would say, 'That sounds odd.' Can you explain that?\" ROMNEY: \"Well, you had to finish the sentence, Soledad. I said I'm not concerned about the very poor that have a safety net, but if it has holes in it, I will repair them. The challenge right now \u2014 we will hear from the Democrat(ic) Party, the plight of the poor. And there's no question, it's not good being poor. And we have a safety net to help those that are very poor. \"But my campaign is focused on middle-income Americans. My campaign \u2014 you can choose where to focus. You can focus on the rich, that's not my focus; you can focus on the very poor \u2014 that's not my focus. My focus is on middle-income Americans, retirees living on Social Security, people who can't find work, folks that have kids that are getting ready to go to college. \"These are the people who have been most badly hurt during the Obama years. We have a very ample safety net. And we can talk about whether it needs to be strengthened or whether there are holes in it. But we have food stamps, we have Medicaid, we have housing vouchers. We have programs to help the poor. But the middle-income Americans, they're the folks that are really struggling right now, and they need someone who can help get this economy going for them.\" By suggesting that voters would hear about the \"plight of the poor\" from Democrats and that he would be focused on the middle class, Romney seemed to be ruling out the idea that an administration could be concerned with both the middle class and the very poor. Or maybe his message was that improving the circumstances of the very poor can only come at the expense of the middle class. Whatever. In any event, it's clear that as far as the Democrats are concerned, Romney is the gift that keeps giving. Jim Messina, Obama's campaign manager, tweeted: So much for \"we're all in this together.\" Romney today: \"I'm not concerned about the very poor\"",

            "article_content": "In Greece, where dire austerity measures are in place, angry voters punished the two main parties that have dominated politics for decades. No party won enough votes in Sunday's parliamentary elections to form a new government. Negotiations will be held to form a coalition government.  DAVID GREENE, HOST: One country that's very familiar with economic problems, Greece, held a parliamentary vote yesterday, and austerity wary voters dealt a devastating blow to both main establishment parties. NPR's Sylvia Poggioli reports the conservative New Democracy and socialist PASOK parties failed even to scrape together the necessary minimum to continue their co-governing coalition. SYLVIA POGGIOLI, BYLINE: Greek voters sent a strong message to their country's international creditors - the EU, ECB and IMF - rejecting their strict austerity policies, and the results overturned nearly half a century of two-party dominance. The party that came in first, the conservative New Democracy, won less than 20 percent of the votes cast. The collapse of the socialist PASOK Party was even starker. It dropped from more than 43 percent in the 2009 elections to just 13.2 percent. Greek voters broke with decades of strict party loyalties, favoring small fringe parties from the extreme right to the extreme left that vehemently reject the bailout terms. New Democracy leader Antonis Samaras, who hoped to govern alone, got the message. ANTONIS SAMARAS: (Through translator) We are ready to take the responsibility to form a new government of national salvation with two aims: for Greece to stay in the eurozone and to amend the terms of the loan agreements, to promote economic growth and relief for Greek society. POGGIOLI: Evangelos Venizelos, whose PASOK party had spent 21 years in government since 1981, conceded it had been a particularly painful day. He also called for a national unity government. EVANGELOS VENIZELOS: (Through translator) A coalition of the old two-party system would not have sufficient legitimacy or a sufficient domestic and international credibility. God of Greece, help us. POGGIOLI: The Greek economy is in free-fall. The jobless rate is 21 percent, and 20 percent of the population lives under the poverty line. The most worrisome sign of angry, anti-austerity sentiment was the success of the extreme rightwing, anti-immigrant Golden Dawn party, whose members use the Nazi salute. The party soared from less than 1 percent three years ago to close to 7 percent. Supporters wearing black T-shirts with a logo similar to the swastika celebrated through the night, brandishing blazing torches in the streets of Athens. Party leader Nikolaos Michaloliakos was visibly triumphant. NIKOLAOS MICHALOLIAKOS: (Through translator) We will continue to combat against the dictatorship of the bailout, both in the parliament and in the streets. POGGIOLI: The most humiliating blow to the entrenched political system was dealt by SYRIZA, the Coalition of the Radical Left, which came in a close second to New Democracy and ahead of the socialists with close to 17 percent. SYRIZA's young leader, Alexis Tsipras, campaigned on the slogan that the loan agreement terms are barbaric, and we are sending a message to Europe. He hailed the results as a political upheaval and a peaceful revolution. ALEXIS TSIPRAS: (Through translator) The people who rewarded our proposal to form a leftist coalition that will cancel loan agreements and overturn the course of our people toward misery. POGGIOLI: With seven parties entering parliament, Greece faces a period of political uncertainty. The fraying of party loyalties was so deep, that six out of 10 voters switched from previous allegiances. Taxi driver Ziloris Naofitos(ph) and his family are examples of the fragmented vote. ZILORIS NAOFITOS: (Through translator) My family has always voted New Democracy. But this time, my daughter and my son-in-law chose the Communist Party, my son SYRIZA, the radical left, my wife, a right-wing anti-bailout party, and I voted for Golden Dawn. POGGIOLI: Greeks woke up today without a clear winner. The frontrunner, New Democracy, will be given three days to try to form a government. Time is of the essence, because next month, Greece has obliged to start slashing another 15-and-a-half billion dollars from the state budget, a task that goes against the popular will.

Golden Dawn is now set to enter parliament for the first time since the end of the military junta in 1974. According to exit polls, angry Greek voters have overwhelmingly punished the two major parties that endorsed draconian international loan agreements. There is no front-runner in sight, but the fringe parties on the left and the right that strongly oppose the bailout terms have benefited the most. The socialist PASOK and the conservative New Democracy parties that have alternated for four decades \u2014 and uneasily co-governed for the last six months \u2014 are imploding. In the last elections in 2009, PASOK won 44 percent, while New Democracy \u2014 at its then- historic low \u2014 garnered 33.9 percent. Exit polls today attribute to each party only about 20 percent of votes cast. The two major parties are taking the brunt of a German-inspired austerity program to overcome Greece's debt crisis. The country is in deep recession, unemployment has hit 21 percent and GDP has been slashed by 20 percent in just two years. In a major upset, Syriza, the Coalition of the Radical Left, was running second behind New Democracy and ahead of PASOK. On the other side of the spectrum, the neo-Nazi-inspired Golden Dawn appears poised to enter parliament for the first time. According to the Greek electoral law, the party that wins the most votes gets a bonus of 50 seats in the 300-seat parliament. So, despite what appears to be their extremely poor results, PASOK and New Democracy might be able to scrape through and continue their governing coalition. But it would be a very weak government facing widespread opposition to the bailout terms and austerity program. The next government also has the tough task of slashing another $15.5 billion from the state budget over the next two years in a country where some 20 percent of the population already lives under the poverty line. Analysts pointed out a significant fraying of old party loyalties. They say that today, 6 out of 10 voters switched from previous allegiances. The election is being closely monitored by European Union officials and Greece's international creditors, which insist that the next Greek government uphold its international commitments. Results are also certainly causing further fibrillation among those Northern European proponents of fierce austerity on debt-heavy Greece. It is not clear whether a rebellious Greece could be forced legally out of the euro-zone. The pressure on Greek voters was intense \u2014 Berlin officials said Greece will have to bear the consequences if the next government does not respect its commitments. But many Greeks did not think the threat of banishment, bankruptcy and further impoverishment was credible. Many voters cast their ballots pinning their hopes on what they see as a mood shift throughout Europe: They no longer see themselves as the isolated, international financial pariah. The anti-austerity movement is growing in Spain, Italy, Ireland and even The Netherlands. It's even toppled Germany's loyal ally President Sarkozy of France. Greeks are hoping this could be a game-changing moment in Europe that weakens the austerity-first crowd and offers alternative policies focusing on growth rather than cutbacks.",

When President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act two years ago, the law's proponents (including me) were confident of two things: That it would become more popular with time and that it would make our health care system more humane and efficient. History has not been kind to the first prediction. Most of the law's components command broad support: Overwhelming majorities still support the requirement that insurers cover people with pre-existing conditions, for example. But overall the Affordable Care Act is unpopular. And while those who wish to keep or strengthen it outnumber those who wish to repeal it, the intensity clearly lies with the latter. Those critics will have one last chance to get their way, in the elections this November. The Supreme Court, which next week hears oral arguments in legal challenges to the law, may help them on their way. On the other hand, the second prediction looks pretty good, at least to this point. Already more than two million young adults have gotten health insurance through their parents' policies. More than five million seniors and people with disabilities have saved more than $3 billion on prescription drug costs, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. Millions of Americans have consumer protections that, for those unlucky to need them, have made a real difference in their lives. Of course, it won't be until 2014 that we see the really big changes in health insurance coverage \u2014 the expansion of Medicaid to include everybody with income below 300 percent of the poverty line, the creation of a marketplace with subsidies where individuals and small businesses can get affordable insurance without discrimination. Undoubtedly this helps explain the public's ambivalence. But another set of changes are happening, too: Changes to the delivery of medicine. The Affordable Care Act isn't simply about making insurance more widely available. It's also about re-engineering the health care industry, so that it operates more efficiently \u2014 providing treatment that is higher quality, less expensive, or both. Its primary means for doing so is a series of changes to the way Medicare pays for treatment. The idea, as Sarah Kliff explains in the Washington Post, is to move from a system that rewards volume (i.e., the number of procedures performed) to a system that rewards value (i.e., the quality of care provided). To the surprise of many observers, myself included, the law seems to be making serious progress towards that goal already. A case in point is Baptist Health System, a hospital network in San Antonio whose story Kliff tells. Three years ago, Baptist decided to change the compensation for surgeons, paying more to those who could demonstrate they were following quality and safety guidelines and less to those who were not. Physicians were initially wary and several left. But compliance with the guidelines improved, the surgeons who remain are taking home bonuses, and Medicare is actually saving money. Insurers are also changing their ways. Jeffrey Young of the Huffington Post notes that Aetna and WellPoint, two of the nation's largest insurers, have increased pay to primary-care providers, in the hopes that focusing on prevention and routine care will reduce the need for more expensive, acute care. Young also reports that Highmark, a nonprofit insurer in Pennsylvania, is getting into the business of providing care directly through clinics of integrated medical professionals. Historically, such systems have provided some of the lowest cost, highest quality care in the country. The Affordable Care isn't the only reason these businesses are changing their ways. Remember, Baptist Health started its experiment began more than a year before the Affordable Care Act became law. But where past efforts at improving the delivery health care stalled after a few years, this one seems to be intensifying. In a recent survey by the Advisory Board, just 16 percent of hospital systems said they had similar payment systems in place. But, as Kliff notes, 75 percent said they expected to have such systems within the next two years. Maybe the clearest sign of change is on the bottom line: Medicare spending has been coming in lower than projections. The recession had something to do with that. For the last few years, people were cutting back on medical care, just like they were cutting back on other expenses. But Paul Ginsburg and Chapin White, two widely respected experts from the relentlessly non-partisan Center on the Study of Health System Change argue that slow growth explains only part of the change. Writing in the New England Journal of Medicine recently, they suggested the Affordable Care Act \u2014 and the incentives its putting in place \u2014 are a major reason Medicare is starting to save money. Harvard's David Cutler, another highly respected economist, has been saying this was possible for a long time. \"It is absolutely not just the recession,\" Cutler, who was an original architect of what became the Affordable Care Act, said via e-mail. \"The ACA is having an impact, as are changes like greater cost sharing. There is a real question as to whether we are entering an era of low cost growth.\" It's far, far too soon to know the full impact of these changes \u2014 or whether they will really last. And the law, as a whole, could have plenty of negative effects. Death panels are a fantasy and mass disruptions of employer insurance seem unlikely, but implementation problems, particularly in states unenthusiastic about carrying out the law, are entirely realistic. And as surely as there will be some winners, there will be some losers, in the health care industry and in the public at large (just as there is in the status quo). Nor is it obvious that the early benefits, particularly those on the delivery side, will make a difference politically. Although the White House and the Obama campaign have been promoting health care reform aggressively in the last two weeks, Obama himself made no special effort to mark the anniversary on Friday. One reason: His advocacy of the law doesn't seem to help its popularity. That may change during the campaign, once Obama can counter-punch against Republicans whose explicit goal is to take health insurance away from both the people who would get it under the Affordable Care Act and some who already have it. For now, though, popular health care remains a dream \u2014 even as successful health care reform starts, slowly but surely, to become reality.",

Would today's Reagan conservatives vote for him \u2014 or run attack ads?\n                \n                    \n                    Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption As president, Ronald Reagan raised taxes and granted amnesty to illegal immigrants. Would today's Reagan conservatives vote for him \u2014 or run attack ads? It's no secret who the most popular Republican is in this year's GOP presidential race. In just one single debate last year, GOP candidates mentioned the former President Ronald Reagan 24 times. Right now, each candidate is vying for the mantle of Reagan conservatism. Yet some historians, and even some of the folks who worked for Ronald Reagan, are now wondering whether Reagan himself was enough of a Reagan conservative \u2014 at least the way it is defined today. So what exactly is a Reagan conservative anyway? If he were alive, could Reagan get the GOP nod? 1 of 12 The Politician Reagan biographer Craig Shirley tells weekends on All Things Considered host Guy Raz that it was against backdrop of the 1970s that Reagan first ran for president. \"You had rampant inflation [and] high interest rates; we were losing [the] Cold War,\" Shirley says. \"Americans had become rampant cheap consumers of the '70s \u2013 disco music or pet rocks or leisure suits \u2013 all of those things that really summed up what was really a very bad time for the American people.\" A young former Nixon aide named John Sears convinced Reagan he should run for president against the incumbent Gerald Ford in 1976. Against huge odds, Reagan actually came close to winning that year and would eventually go on to win in 1980. Reagan had a cultural appeal with the New-Deal, blue-collar, urban-ethnic, lunch-bucket voters that other Republicans didn't, Shirley says. \"Nixon had a little bit, but not the way Reagan did. So this was the beginning of his reorganization of the two parties,\" he says. The man who became the most important American conservative icon in the 20th century was, in many ways, a moderate, says Shirley. In 1978, Reagan campaigned against a referendum in California called Proposition 6 that would have banned gays and lesbians, and possibly anyone who supported gay rights, from working in the state's public schools. The bill was supported by the Christian right and sponsored by state legislator John Briggs. The measure failed, and Briggs later said it was solely because of Reagan. Ronald Reagan rose to the presidency at the end of the 70s, an era when inflation and the Cold War threatened America.\n                \n                    \n                    Hulton Archive/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Ronald Reagan rose to the presidency at the end of the 70s, an era when inflation and the Cold War threatened America. The President In recent years, Sen. Lindsey Graham, former Gov. Mike Huckabee and Rep. Duncan Hunter Jr. \u2014 all Republicans \u2014 have suggested Reagan would have a tough time winning the GOP nomination today. Reporter Walter Shapiro is covering his ninth presidential campaign, now for Yahoo! News and The New Republic. He tells NPR's Raz that there were plenty of Reagan-era policies that wouldn't sit well with the GOP today \u2014 like raising taxes. In the early '80s there was a deficit problem, and after massively lowering taxes there was an adjustment upward. Reagan's tax reform of 1986, which basically eliminated a number of deductions in order to lower rates, would be attacked today, Shapiro says. \"In an attack ad today,\" he adds, \"you'd say, 'Whose side is he on?\" Also in 1986, Reagan's Immigration Reform and Control Act granted amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants who entered the U.S. prior to Jan. 1, 1982. \"This is the immigration bill that the Republicans are railing against when they say, 'No more amnesties' \u2014 and this was Ronald Reagan,\" he says. Many of the GOP candidates running for president have repeatedly pointed out that many \u2014 mostly poor \u2014 Americans don't pay federal income taxes. But in his 1985 State of the Union address, Reagan said he'd propose the exemption of federal income taxes to those living at or below the poverty line. \"This is, again, the problem with this plaster-saint iconography,\" Shapiro says. There are many ways in which Reagan was a genuine conservative, Shapiro says, but he wasn't consistent. If Reagan were running today, Shapiro can imagine superPAC ads referring to him as a \"former liberal-Democrat\" or \"tax-raiser Ronald Reagan.\" \"The truth is that political figures, particularly when viewed from the lens of history, are far more complicated creatures than they are when they're viewed through the lens of bumper stickers,\" Shapiro says. The Man Vs. His Legend So how does Ronald Reagan compare to the modern definition of a Reagan conservative? David Stockman, Reagan's former budget director, tells Raz that he doesn't think Reagan quite matches up. \"Even though he was highly negative about the role of government ... he was also enough of a pragmatist to recognize facts,\" Stockman says. The modern interpretation of who Reagan was is based on two things, Stockman says: a selective reading of history and a full-bore adoption of Reagan rhetoric. \"What the history books are going to show, I believe, is that the Reagan revolution never happened. It was a campaign slogan,\" he says. \"Government wasn't reduced; taxes were cut marginally, but the basic functions of the federal government didn't change.\" What is left, Stockman says, is a lot of slogans and campaign speeches that the current crop of Republican politicians like to repeat over and over. Ultimately, Stockman says, it does matter that the Republican Party of today is so very different from the Republican Party of Reagan's era. He says in any democracy you can't have fiscal stability or discipline unless you have one party that advocates discipline. \"The Republican Party has given up the role that the conservative party needs to play in a democracy,\" he says. \"As a result of surrendering that role, we're in a very difficult and I think dangerous position.\" This year, Stockman is backing Ron Paul.",

            "article_content": "Egypt's post-revolution art scene is documenting the country's emotional roller coaster of a transition through music and graffiti art. Since the uprising against Hosni Mubarak, small indie bands have popped up to sing or rap about the political situation in Egypt. The graffiti that lines Cairo's streets is also evolving with the transition.  MELISSA BLOCK, HOST: This is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. I'm Melissa Block. ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: And I'm Robert Siegel. Egyptians have been riding an emotional roller coaster in the 18 months since the ouster of President Hosni Mubarak. There have been power struggles, the first truly free elections in more than 60 years, a sharp economic downturn and promises of reform that have yet to materialize. NPR's Leila Fadel reports that the country's post-revolutionary art scene reflects all of those peaks and valleys. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) LEILA FADEL, BYLINE: He calls himself Alaa Fifty. Two years ago, the 23-year-old from a working class district of Cairo probably would have been turned away at the door of this smoky nightclub where activists, filmmakers, foreigners and hipsters mingle. Now he's the Saturday night attraction at After Eight with a new type of music that is sweeping the Cairo scene - electro shaabi. Shaabi means popular and is a reference to street music. Alaa Fifty raps about drug addiction, abuse by security forces and other things to an audience of the elite in the dialect of the streets. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) FADEL: Sharbi DJs like Amr Haha and Achmed (unintelligible), along with what they call mike men, like Alaa Fifty, once only found an audience at street weddings and festivals. But since the uprising last year, the mix of techno, hip-hop and Egyptian street music is bounding across socio-economic classes. We sing about things you can't imagine, Alaa says, as his group sets up equipment for tonight's performance. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) FADEL: There's a kind of youthful arrogance about these 20-something performers. They even have groupies on the side of the small wooden platform where they rap. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) FADEL: Observers here say the popular uprising against Hosni Mubarak prompted a musical revolution. In the past, Egyptian songs were mostly escapist with lyrics about love and heartbreak, distant from the realities of life where almost half the population lives under the poverty line. Now, there are new breakout stars whose lyrics are bold and reflective of social issues. Electro-shaabi is not the only new genre that's on the scene. Other musicians tracking the ups and downs of this transition with their lyrics are also growing in popularity. Many, like Ramy Essam, are garnering an international audience. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) FADEL: Ramy Essam is the singer of Egypt's revolution. He's most famous for this song. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) FADEL: During Egypt's revolt, he put the chants of Tahrir Square into a song he wrote in two minutes. (foreign language spoken) - leave, he's saying, echoing the protestor's demands for Mubarak to go. RAMY ESSAM: (Foreign language spoken) FADEL: The young singer says, when he first started, he sang about what all singers did - love. Now his music has purpose. ESSAM: (Foreign language spoken) FADEL: Whenever I feel the people want to say something, he says, I become the mirror that reflects their will. But Essam does more than sing. He was beaten and detained during one protest last year. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) FADEL: His latest song questions President Mohamed Morsi's vows to alleviate the nauseating traffic and clean up the garbage strewn streets during his first 100 days in office. He also mocks Morsi's Islamist background. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) FADEL: 100 days, they fooled us, the lyrics go. The people are frustrated, waiting for this government of the beardo-crats. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) FADEL: It's not only music that is focusing on social injustice and political struggle. Visual art, too, is bolder than it ever was. Mohamed Fahmy is an artist who goes by the name Ganzeer, and is now showing his work in Belgium, Switzerland and soon, in one of Cairo's oldest and most established galleries. His fame took off with graffiti portraits of the revolution's martyrs that he painted on walls across the capitol. Most are gone now - painted over by the authorities. GANZEER: It's apparent that the regime or the government or whatever, is very quickly trying to erase this memory of there having been dead people, people who were killed during this revolution. FADEL: Ganzeer was a well-known artist before the uprising but now, he says, the audience for his type of work has grown. GANZEER: I guess there's like somehow more reception. The audience for that work is just more hungry for socially relevant work, more so than before maybe. FADEL: Leila Fadel, NPR News, Cairo. Copyright \u00a9 2012 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "After Tuesday night's presidential debate in New York, GOP nominee Mitt Romney headed South for a pair of rallies in Virginia. The state is an important swing state in this year's election. Romney went question by question through some of his favorite moments in the town hall debate.  RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: It's MORNING EDITION, from NPR News. I'm Renee Montagne. DAVID GREENE, HOST: And I'm David Greene. Good morning. After their lively town hall debate on Long Island Tuesday night, President Obama and his Republican rival Mitt Romney jetted off in different directions yesterday to rally the faithful and woo the undecided in some key battleground states. MONTAGNE: The president flew to the Midwest for campaign rallies in Iowa and Ohio. In a moment, we'll hear from Scott Horsley, who's with the Obama campaign.  Mitt Romney headed south, for a pair of rallies in Virginia. 2008 was the first time in decades that Virginia voters chose a Democrat for president. GREENE: And it's a tight race in that state this year. Virginia has really become one of the most important swing states. NPR's Ari Shapiro is traveling there with the Republican presidential candidate, and he filed this report. ARI SHAPIRO, BYLINE: Mitt Romney's second debate with President Obama may not have been a clear win like the first one, but in Chesapeake, Virginia, the Republican challenger took the stage sounding like a happy warrior. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) MITT ROMNEY: I love these debates. You know, these things are great. SHAPIRO: He quickly accused the president of failing to articulate a second-term agenda. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) ROMNEY: I just think the American people had expected that the president of the United States would be able to describe what he's going to do in the next four years. But he can't. He can't even explain what he's done in the last four years. SHAPIRO: Romney went question-by-question through some of his favorite moments in the town hall debate. He mentioned Jeremy, who asked about finding a job after college, Catherine, who spoke about equal pay for women, and Philip, who asked about gas prices. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) ROMNEY: And then you heard Lorraine saying: When you promised, Mr. President, to put in place an immigration reform bill in your first term - oh, I guess it was me that asked this question, but it was her idea. She brought up immigration. SHAPIRO: In front of this friendly crowd, Mitt Romney revisited some moments that didn't go quite right the night before. One of those awkward moments included the phrase: binders full of women. Democrats have attacked Governor Romney for that clunky description of how he sought out women to work for him as governor of Massachusetts. On the campaign trail yesterday, Romney revisited the issue, if not the phrase. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) ROMNEY: This president has failed America's women. They've suffered in terms of getting jobs. They've suffered in terms of falling into poverty. This is a presidency that has not helped America's women. SHAPIRO: This is important because Romney closed the polls with President Obama in the last couple of weeks largely by shrinking the gender gap. And there were other memorable parts of the debate that Romney left out of this stump speech roundup. The debate's two hottest exchanges dealt with Libya and China. Neither came up in Romney's comments yesterday. Republican voters in this Virginia crowd were muted in their praise of Romney's Long Island performance. VICTOR MARQUES: I think he did OK. I think he did fine, as far as I'm concerned. Nothing would change my mind, anyway. SHAPIRO: That's Victor Marques of Newport News, Virginia. Eddie Zapata is even less bullish. He says his candidate did great a couple of weeks ago. EDDIE ZAPATA: The first one Romney won quite open, but then the second one, Obama kind of defended himself a little better. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SHAPIRO: In public yesterday, campaign staffers emphasized the high points of Romney's debate performance.  They talked about how strong he was on the economy and job creation. But in private, they grumbled about the moderator and seemed far less jubilant than they were two weeks ago. In the evening, comedian Dennis Miller introduced Romney to another crowd - a big one, 8,000 people packing a grassy park in Leesburg, Virginia. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) DENNIS MILLER: You do hear the word gosh come out of his pie hole once in a while. And you know what? I've had the hipster president. How's about the gosh president? Isn't it time we get back to the gosh president? SHAPIRO: At this rally, Mitt Romney talked about energy issues, tossing a belated retort to one of President Obama's attack lines Tuesday night. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) ROMNEY: He said, you know, we've built pipelines that would go around the Earth. And I thought, you know, it's just the one that comes from Canada with the oil that's the one we want, you see? And so that's the one I'm going to get. SHAPIRO: Romney looked ahead to the next presidential debate, just five days off. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) ROMNEY: We have one weekend left before our final debate, and I hope he's able to come up with an agenda over the weekend. So in that last debate, he's able to describe what he'd do if he got four more years. SHAPIRO: Then Romney added: But that's not likely to happen, so he doesn't need to worry about it.

To become president and to be re-elected president takes much luck (among other factors, like money and political skill.) And President Obama appears to be one of the most fortunate presidents in recent memory with the release of the latest employment report. With a month left before the general election, the U.S. Labor Department's report that the jobless rate dropped to 7.8 percent in September \u2014 falling below the 8 percent barrier for the first time since early in Obama's presidency \u2014 was good news not just for the nation, but for a president who needed some right about now. The economy also added 114,000 jobs in September, below estimates, but still a decent number. Coming as it did on the heels of the president's widely derided debate performance against Republican challenger Mitt Romney on Wednesday night, the new economic data was likely to give a timely jolt of renewed confidence to a Democratic presidential campaign that was thrown off stride by the debate. At a campaign rally in Fairfax, Va., a Washington, D.C., suburb, Obama walked the line of marking the good news while trying not to seem too triumphant \u2014 since there were still more than 12 million people looking for work: \"After losing about 800,000 jobs when I took office, our businesses have added 5.2 million new jobs over the past 2-1/2 years. This morning we found out that the unemployment rate has fallen to its lowest level since I took office. More Americans entered the workforce, more people are getting jobs. \"Now, every month reminds us we still have too many of our friends and neighbors who are looking for work. There are too many middle-class families that are struggling to pay the bills. They were struggling long before the crisis hit. Today's news certainly is not an excuse to try to talk down the economy to score a few political points. It's a reminder that this country has come too far to turn back now.\" If it was good news for the president, it raised a new challenge for Romney. Would his attacks against Obama's management of the economy be dulled by the good economic news now that the jobless rate has fallen below the 8 percent psychological barrier? Obama's re-election chances have long been clouded by how halting the economic recovery has been. The president has been haunted specifically by an optimistic forecast, made by some of his economic experts early in 2009 as part of their argument for the $800 billion fiscal stimulus, that it would cause the unemployment rate to peak at 8 percent. Of course, it eventually went higher, topping out at 9.9 percent in May 2010 before it began declining. The difference, however, between Obama's economists' forecasts \u2014 despite all their warnings that such forecasts are inexact \u2014 and the reality of the actual jobless numbers, gave Obama's Republican opponents plenty of fodder to attack him over much of his presidency. While Friday's relatively good employment report clearly had to be a relief for the Obama campaign, it was indisputable that the economy was still far from robust. That left plenty of room for Republicans, especially Romney, to continue their economic attacks against Obama. And, indeed, that was the only approach that made sense this late in the campaign, since Romney's entire argument for his candidacy boils down to an argument that Obama has failed to turn around the economy \u2014 and that the former Massachusetts governor's success in the private sector makes him the better choice for the White House. Romney issued a news release along those lines: \"This is not what a real recovery looks like. We created fewer jobs in September than in August, and fewer jobs in August than in July, and we've lost over 600,000 manufacturing jobs since President Obama took office. If not for all the people who have simply dropped out of the labor force, the real unemployment rate would be closer to 11%. The results of President Obama's failed policies are staggering \u2014 23 million Americans struggling for work, nearly one in six living in poverty and 47 million people dependent on food stamps to feed themselves and their families. The choice in this election is clear. Under President Obama, we'll get another four years like the last four years. If I'm elected, we will have a real recovery with pro-growth policies that will create 12 million new jobs and rising incomes for everyone.\" In the hothouse atmosphere of a presidential race, even the integrity of the economists and statisticians who produce the Bureau of Labor Statistics jobs data became a casualty of political warfare. Former GE CEO Jack Welch, for instance, through a tweet, questioned the timing of the September jobless rate falling to 7.8 percent: \"Unbelievable jobs numbers..these Chicago guys will do anything..can't debate so change numbers.\" The \"Chicago guys\" would be Obama and his campaign team, which is based in the nation's third largest city. Coming to the Bureau of Labor Statistics' defense was Lawrence Mishel of the Economic Policy Institute, a progressive think tank. \"It is simply outrageous to make such a claim, and echoes the worrying general distrust of facts that seems to have swept segments of our nation. ... BLS is a highly professional agency with dozens of people involved in the tabulation and analysis of these data. The idea that the data are manipulated is just completely implausible.\" It was just the latest example of statistics being seen through a partisan lens. In recent weeks, the reliability of polls from some of the nation's most respected polling firms has been questioned by Republican critics because they showed Obama leading in most battleground states. Republicans accused the pollsters of sampling bias, of phoning too many Democrats relative to Republicans. Pollsters, and some Republican non-pollsters, have dismissed such suspicions. One more official jobs report is scheduled for release before the general election. That comes on Nov. 2, just four days before Americans go to the polls. Coming as close as that one will to the election, it may be too late to do either presidential campaign significant good, especially with all the early voting taking place throughout the nation. So Friday's report may very well be the last one that really matters to the 2012 presidential election.",

Having concluded that series, she's written a novel for grown-ups called The Casual Vacancy, a story of troubled teenagers and their even more troubled parents. A local politician in an English town drops dead, prompting not mourning, but an outbreak of speculation over his suddenly empty town council seat. There's no magic in Vacancy, though readers of the Potter books may well recognize Rowling's acute and often painful observations of human nature. Rowling tells NPR's Steve Inskeep that Vacancy was a book she felt a deep need to write. \"Exactly as with Harry Potter, I knew it was something I really, really wanted to write. I became excited about the idea of writing it,\" she says. \"It's a very personal book ... It's not my story, but it does address themes, subjects that are very important to me.\" Rowling got the idea on a plane, while touring the United States to promote the last Harry Potter book. \"There appears to be something to do with vehicles and movement that stimulates my writing,\" she laughs. Rowling was, famously, on a train when she had the idea for Harry Potter. J.K. Rowling is taking her first steps into the world of adult literature after the immense success of the Harry Potter series.\n                \n                    \n                    Debra Hurford Brown\n                    \n                \nhide caption J.K. Rowling is taking her first steps into the world of adult literature after the immense success of the Harry Potter series. There are kids in Vacancy, but they're worlds away from Harry and his wizarding pals. \"I knew that there would be an element of subversion in the story,\" Rowling says. \"Largely from the teenagers, in that they attempt to influence what's going on.\" She describes those teenagers as simultaneously victims and protagonists: \"I suppose that the whole plot revolves around the question of what we do with someone like this particular teenage girl ... from a very deprived family. She's rather disruptive in school; there are just a lot of aspects to her situation that interest me,\" Rowling says. \"In some ways, for very personal reasons, because \u2014 as is very well-documented \u2014 I, too, have passed through a period of poverty in Britain and can understand some of those issues.\" \"I think that I've had a very strange life,\" Rowling adds. She came from a well-educated, lower-middle-class background, she says, but as many biographies have noted, she ended up on welfare after her first marriage broke down. Pressed to describe what \"middle class\" means in the British class system, Rowling laughs. \"I'm really not qualified to do it ... I think you could ask 10 English people the same question about class and get a very different answer. Social mobility is one of the great issues of the day here, as I'm sure it is in America.\" Rowling says she hasn't met with class prejudice since her success. But, she adds, \"I would say that I have many times met with the assumption that my attitudes have changed much more than they have towards people who are still in the kind of situation I once was.\" She recalls an encounter with a man who described his neighborhood as free of \"riff-raff.\" \"His assumption was that I would be glad to have kept out of my area the kind of person that I used to be, because I think, you know, not that long ago he would have considered me riff-raff, too.\" Rowling's experience with poverty \u2014 and with teaching \u2014 informed her portrait of the deprived and disruptive Krystal. \"When people are very damaged, they can often meet the world with a kind of defiance,\" she says. \"This automatic denial, this wish not to take responsibility for anything, this fear that if fault is found, they will be condemned and ruthlessly punished ... I saw that a lot when I was teaching. And yet it does absolutely, it can and does often go hand in hand with a very routinely cavalier ... relationship with the truth, and with what you and I would consider very basic morals.\" But when characters like Krystal and her mother feel powerless or unjustly accused, their anger can be intense. \"One of the great problems for me is that the poor ... are so often discussed just as this large, shapeless mass. You lose your individuality a huge amount when you have no money, and I certainly had that experience,\" she says. \"You become part of a problem. You're someone who stands in a line to get money; it's not where you want to be, and you become very voiceless.\" Another teenager in the novel, Andrew, posts to a web site an anonymous message about his abusive father \u2014 unaware that his actions will have a lasting and far-reaching impact. \"It goes to the heart of these teenaged characters,\" says Rowling, \"that they are this curious mix, which I think is very characteristic of adolescence, of being truth-seekers in the way that adolescents often are. They crave the big picture, they crave the grand gesture ... yet at the same time, they have very little empathy.\" Rowling adds that her 19-year-old daughter has read Vacancy. \"She had a curious reaction, actually. ... She said, 'It's made me realize how much I don't know.' .... She wasn't old enough when we left a life of real poverty to remember some of what I can remember, and I suppose this book brought it home to her, what kind of existence we could have had.\" But Rowling says she hasn't thought much about the reaction of professional critics. \"I truly don't mean this in any kind of an arrogant way, but I feel very liberated at the moment. And whatever the reviewers feel about The Casual Vacancy, it is what I wanted it to be, and you can't say fairer than that as a writer.\"",

            "article_content": "Separate appearances Friday by President Obama and Rep. Paul Ryan before an AARP meeting in New Orleans proved that the third rail of American politics, Medicare and Social Security collectively, is still very much electrified. Speaking to a supremely friendly audience via live video feed from Virginia, where he was campaigning, Obama drew repeated applause and cheers with promises to defend Medicare and Social Security from Republican proposals that he said threaten the entitlement programs' ability to deliver the kind of benefits seniors have become accustomed to. Ryan appeared in person a short while later before the same AARP group. But given the audience's negative reaction to much of his speech, the Republican vice presidential nominee could be forgiven if he at times wished he, too, could have delivered his remarks by remote video feed. The audience response to Ryan was at best mixed, with boos and jeers as well as some cheers, when he talked about his proposal to change Medicare and criticized the president's approach. Showing again that he intends to cut GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney no slack for his controversial private-fundraiser remarks about the \"47 percent\" \u2014 comments revealed by a secretly recorded video in which Romney said nearly half of the electorate depended on government handout \u2014 Obama said: \"But given the conversations that have been out there in \u2014 in the political arena lately, I want to emphasize, Medicare and Social Security are not handouts. [Applause.] You've paid into these programs your whole lives. You've earned them. And as president, it's my job to make sure that Medicare and Social Security remain strong for today's seniors for future generations.\" It was one of numerous lines that drew generous applause. The president also used his AARP appearance as his latest opportunity to rebut Republican charges that he raided Medicare of $716 billion to fund the Affordable Care Act, or \"Obamacare,\" the word the president used. (\"I don't mind the term because I do care. That's why we passed the bill,\" Obama said to more cheers and applause.) As fact checkers have repeatedly explained, the $716 billion represents reductions in payments to insurers and health providers. Obama said: \"I have strengthened Medicare as president. [Applause.] We've added years to the life of the program by getting rid of taxpayer subsidies to insurance companies that weren't making people healthier. \"And we used those savings to lower prescription drug costs and to offer seniors on Medicare new preventive services like cancer screenings and wellness services. In fact, the health reform law we passed has already saved more than 5.5 million seniors and people with disabilities nearly $4.5 billion on their prescription drugs. [Applause.] Seniors who received a discount have saved an average of more than $600 this year alone. And over the next 10 years, we expect the average Medicare beneficiary to save nearly $5,000 as a result of this law.\" In a pre-emptive strike against Ryan, the president reminded the audience (as though it needed any reminder) that the Wisconsin congressman and House Budget Committee chairman had proposed changing Medicare for future beneficiaries so they would get what critics call a voucher, a fixed amount with which they would then have to purchase health insurance from private companies. For good measure, Obama warned the audience that Romney's proposed $5 trillion in tax cuts weighted toward the wealthy could leave seniors paying higher taxes on their Social Security. OBAMA: \"Independent experts say there is no way to do that with all \u2014 without also cutting deductions that the middle class relies on. And that includes taxing things like Social Security benefits. And this could mean higher taxes for seniors on Social Security, including taxing benefits for seniors who make less than $32,000 a year for the first time ever. Nearly 30 million seniors could see their taxes go up by hundreds of dollars. So I want you all to know at AARP, I'm not going to let that happen.\" That prompted another round of cheers and applause from the crowd. It was a tough act for Ryan to follow. Ryan was greeted with polite applause when he walked onstage. But that didn't last long. Not long after he began to speak, he mentioned Obamacare, and obviously not with the president's affection for the law. RYAN: \"Today, our nation faces a political turning point. Government mismanagement and political cowardice are threatening both sides of LBJ's pledge. Seniors are threatened by Obamacare, a law that would force steep cuts to real benefits in real time for real people.\" [Shouts, boos.] \"Meanwhile \u2014 [boos] \u2014 meanwhile, younger Americans are burdened by an ever-growing national debt and a diminished future. \"Here's the good news. By embracing common-sense reforms now, we can get ahead of the problem and keep promises people have organized their lives around. You see, if we reform Medicare for my generation, we can protect it for those in or near retirement today.\" [Applause.] \"The first step to a stronger Medicare is to repeal Obamacare, because it represents the worst of both worlds. [Boos.] \"I had a feeling there would be mixed reactions, so let me get into it. [Boos.] It weakens Medicare for today's seniors and puts it at risk for the next generation. [Boos.] First, it funnels $716 billion out of Medicare to pay for a new entitlement we didn't even ask for. [Boos.] Second, it puts 15 unelected bureaucrats in charge of Medicare's future.\" And so it went for Ryan. When boos weren't accompanied by a smattering of cheers, there was silence. Both the president and Ryan fielded a few questions from the audience. Obama was asked if he supported raising the income cap on Social Security taxes, which now stands at $106,000, which means that those who make $1 million annually pay taxes into the program on around 10 percent of their income versus most Americans, who pay on 100 percent of theirs. OBAMA: \"You know, I do think that looking at changing the cap is an important aspect of putting Social Security on a more stable footing. [Applause.] And what I've said is \u2014 is that I'm willing to work with Republicans and examine all their ideas, but what I'm not going to do, as a matter of principle, is to slash benefits or privatize Social Security and suddenly turn it over to Wall Street \u2014 [applause] \u2014 because we saw what can happen back in 2008, 2009, when \u2014 when the stock market crashed. And we're still recovering from that.\" Ryan was asked if he would cut benefits or increase taxes to put Social Security on a sounder footing. RYAN: \"So Mitt and I put a specific plan out here on this. We think that a tax increase on payroll taxes is bad for economics, it's bad for growth, and it especially hurts self-employed people. You have to remember a self-employed person, like a farmer or somebody working their own business, they pay both sides of the payroll tax, and we think that that hurts job creation, plus it doesn't get you the kind of revenues you need to fix the problem. But if you put small changes now that don't kick in till people who are 54 and below retire, you can actually make these modest changes that make the program solvent for 75 years. \"And so what we're saying is gradually raise that retirement age to reflect longevity in the future \u2014 wouldn't even start till 2025, I believe \u2014 and don't give wealthier people as much of an increase in their benefits as everyone else does, and bring that bottom benefit up to at least the poverty line.\"",

Mitt Romney has sought to distinguish his views on foreign policy and the world from positions held by President Obama. So far, it hasn't gained him much traction. The Republican presidential nominee has insisted that Obama has not done enough to promote America's values and interests, instead \"apologizing\" and appeasing the nation's enemies. Romney has described Russia, a country with which Obama has sought to \"reset\" relations, as the nation's greatest geopolitical foe. He declared the president \"simply naive\" and \"out of touch\" after Obama said in July that Venezuela posed no serious threat to the U.S. This week, Romney criticized Obama for his Middle East policy in general and the administration's response to violence outside U.S. embassies in particular. \"This is the centerpiece of his critique, that President Obama has been too accommodating of adversaries and too quick to be dismissive of our allies, and Romney wants to reverse that balance,\" says Peter Feaver, a Duke University political scientist who served on the National Security Council under President George W. Bush. \"The events in Cairo, the early tweets from Cairo, seem to be a kind of smoking-gun illustration of his critique of Obama,\" Feaver says. \"That's why they came out with their criticism when they did.\" But some foreign policy analysts say that for all his complaints about Obama and his talk about restoring U.S. leadership, Romney has struggled to outline exactly what he would do differently than has the incumbent. Budget pressures may not allow him to boost defense spending as much as he would like, and it's far from certain that the country is in the mood for military interventions in places like Iran, following a decade of war in Afghanistan or Iraq. \"Were Romney to come into office and try to ramp up the defense budget, keep troops in Afghanistan, refuse to deal with the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt and break off negotiations with Iran and send the bombers, I think there would be enormous pushback not just from the public but within the Republican Party,\" says Charles Kupchan, who was a National Security Council staffer under President Bill Clinton. Taking A Tougher Line Kupchan says that Romney's rhetoric has sounded so tough in part because Obama hasn't left him much political room to occupy on foreign policy issues. The president's aggressive use of drone strikes and the killing of terrorist leader Osama bin Laden have inoculated him against some of the traditional complaints that Democrats are weak on defense. \"Obama has reversed the trend since Vietnam that gave Republicans a leg up on national security,\" says Kupchan, now a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. \"That's gone.\" Needless to say, Republicans differ. Among the complaints Romney and other Republicans often lodge against Obama is that he has not done enough to protect American interests, whether it's standing up to China on currency manipulation or responding to the upheaval in the Arab world over the past couple of years. \"Right now, we're a country whose main answer to the call of global leadership is 'No,' \" says Danielle Pletka, vice president of foreign and defense policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. If Romney were president, she says, \"We won't have to rely on the president of France to suggest that something needs to be done in Syria. We won't need to rely on the leadership of Great Britain to suggest we need a harder line on Iran.\" The Iran Question It's not clear exactly where Romney would draw the \"red line\" in terms of what would make him respond with military force to Iran's nuclear ambitions. But it's apparent he believes the U.S. needs to stand with Israel in making sure Iran does not build a bomb. \"There's an open debate about what President Obama would do when faced with the actual choice of war, versus learning to live with an Iranian weapon,\" says Feaver, the Duke political scientist. \"I know responsible people who think when faced with that choice, he would go the containment route,\" Feaver says. \"I don't know many who think Romney would.\" Romney may be trying to pick up support among Jewish voters \"by saying we're not going to throw Israel under the bus,\" says Lawrence Korb, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, a think tank stocked with Obama allies. But opinion polls suggest Americans as a whole won't look kindly on military action against Iran, he says. \"The American public doesn't want it,\" Korb says. \"The American public wants us to focus on stuff at home.\" Not Just The Economy Romney moved quickly to lay out a foreign policy agenda ahead of the Republican primaries. But until this past week, he had talked less about such issues than a typical GOP candidate might have in the past. Both Romney and Obama have concerned themselves more with domestic issues. Many commentators have suggested that Romney's best political strategy is to keep his focus on the economy. Just this week, the Census Bureau reported that household income, when adjusted for inflation, has dropped to its lowest level since 1995, while the percentage of the population living in poverty remained at a record high. Romney will continue to clarify his positions leading up to the last of the presidential debates on Oct. 22, which will be devoted to foreign policy. \"The campaign has been primarily focused on economics, and this week we saw a bit of a pivot,\" says Kenneth Weinstein, president of the Hudson Institute, a conservative-leaning think tank. \"In the next few weeks, Gov. Romney and his surrogates are going to lay the groundwork for criticizing the president's foreign policy.\" When he has spoken about world issues, Romney has not always drawn rave reviews. In addition to criticism of his remarks surrounding events that led to the killing of a U.S. ambassador Tuesday, Romney drew heat for some of his comments during his July tour of Great Britain, Israel and Poland. Still, Romney will want to define clear differences between his own approach to world affairs and Obama's, differences he hopes will pay off at the polls. \"It's hard to say what any president is going to do until they get into office,\" says Weinstein. \"But there are clear outlines of a Romney foreign and defense policy that recognizes American exceptionalism, that will be more muscular in response to events and one that I think has got a more positive vision of what America and its allies can achieve.\"",

            "article_content": "As the Democratic National Convention kicks off in Charlotte, N.C., the economy is expected to be a central theme. The event is bookended by Monday's Labor Day celebrations and Friday's release of the latest monthly numbers on jobs.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Now, as you can hear from Scott's report, the economy is a top issue in this campaign. DAVID GREENE, HOST: So it's fitting that the Democratic Convention was preceded by Labor Day and will be followed by Friday's release of the latest employment numbers. INSKEEP: NPR's Yuki Noguchi talked with voters about jobs on Labor Day. YUKI NOGUCHI, BYLINE: This year, Labor Day festivities came to Charlotte in the form of a huge street party. (SOUNDBITE OF SINGING) NOGUCHI: This is Carolinafest - a Labor Day effort to put some party into the party of labor. Later this week, a few blocks from here, President Obama will  try to win over people like Shonn Yang, who says he's not sure who deserves his vote. SHONN YANG: I don't really know. NOGUCHI: You don't really know. YANG: Yeah. NOGUCHI: You're really undecided. YANG: I'm still thinking - yeah, I'm still thinking about it, yeah. NOGUCHI: Yang is a 23-year-old high school graduate who works part-time as a UPS truck loader. He says he considers himself lower middle-class and the economy is the story for people in his world. YANG: I know a few guys that I work with, they're part-timers, and a lot of them have Bachelor degrees and it's hard for them to find jobs. It's crazy, 'cause they spent all this money going to college but they're just doing what I'm doing, and that's not good for them. NOGUCHI: The president narrowly won North Carolina four years ago, but this year it's divided and undecided, largely because of the halting economy. This week, the Obama administration is hoping to color the state a little bluer, specifically by focusing on jobs and the economy. Ben LaBolt is the national spokesman for the Obama campaign. BEN LABOLT: The core question voters are going to ask when they head to the polls on Election Day is who will create good-paying, sustainable jobs for the middle class. NOGUCHI: With national unemployment at 8.3 percent, the economy is a touchy issue for the Obama campaign. Republican challenger Mitt Romney yesterday called Labor Day another day of worrying for out-of-work Americans. But LaBolt says the president is making job creation a priority. LABOLT: The focus of our convention will lay out the vision for creating those good-paying, sustainable jobs for the middle class and building the economy from the middle class out. NOGUCHI: Expect to hear those words - middle class - a lot this week. To understand why, consider a Washington Post-ABC News survey from last week. It showed Governor Romney had the edge on President Obama when it came to handling the economy, but Mr. Obama had the lead on understanding the middle class's financial problems. In other words, framing the economy and jobs as a middle class issue works in the president's favor. Ross Baker, a political science professor at Rutgers, says it's no surprise to see the emphasis on the middle class. ROSS BAKER: It's kind of - it's got mythic qualities to it. NOGUCHI: Baker says it's like code to call yourself middle class. BAKER: So many Americans identify with it, even though objectively they're not part of it. There are people who, you know, who are barely above the poverty level who want to see themselves as middle class. For people who are poor, it's an exalted status. For people who are a little bit self-conscious about being too prosperous, it's a safe identification. NOGUCHI: I interviewed a restaurant manager, a pedicab driver, two entrepreneurs, a nurse and students at yesterday's Carolina Fest. Many of them describe themselves as undecided voters and all self-identified as middle class. Baker says this year the desire to be middle class dovetails with an attack line the Democrats love. BAKER: The Obama plan is to make Mitt Romney look like Louis XVI. JAMES JOHNSON: Get 'em right here. Rally behind the president. NOGUCHI: Back at Carolina Fest, that's a message that resonates with James Johnson, a visitor from Ohio who's here selling Obama rally towels for $5 apiece. JOHNSON: We know that Romney, he's a very wealthy man, where President Obama had to grow into his wealth. NOGUCHI: Johnson says that's a message he hopes will carry his home state, as well as North Carolina. Yuki Noguchi, NPR News, Charlotte, North Carolina. Copyright \u00a9 2012 NPR.

            "article_content": "This composite image shows Republican vice presidential candidate Rep. Paul Ryan (left) and Vice President Biden. Both men are Catholic, but their worldviews are strikingly different.\n                \n                    \n                    Jose Luis Magana/Thanassis Stavrakis/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption This composite image shows Republican vice presidential candidate Rep. Paul Ryan (left) and Vice President Biden. Both men are Catholic, but their worldviews are strikingly different. When Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney selected Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin to be his running mate, Catholics passed a milestone. For the first time in history, both vice presidential candidates, Ryan and Vice President Biden, are Catholic. But if Biden and Ryan share the same faith, they couldn't be further apart in their cultural and political worldviews. On issues such as abortion, same-sex marriage, taxes and Medicaid, they are miles apart. How can that be? Reflecting 'The Old And The New' Catholicism is complicated, says Deal Hudson, a Catholic strategist for the Republican Party. It can't be pigeonholed as conservative or liberal. He says that, increasingly, the divisions within the Catholic faithful are sharpening \u2014 and this race reflects that. \"These two vice presidential candidates represent the old and the new in the Catholic church in the United States,\" Hudson says. Biden comes from a more traditional generation of Catholics, says Stephen Schneck, a political scientist at Catholic University of America. \"This is the Catholicism of our old ethnic neighborhoods, and our union halls, and St. Christopher medals on the dashboard sort of thing,\" Stephen says. It is a working-class Catholicism, he says, where the Mass and the rosary are part of the warp and woof of daily life in places such as Scranton, Pa., Biden's boyhood town. As Biden said when he visited Scranton in 2008, \"This is where my family values and my faith melded.\" Those values \u2014 of the cop, the fireman, the union leader \u2014 placed Catholics solidly in the Democratic camp for decades. Schneck, who co-chairs Catholics for Obama, says these Catholics tend to have a positive attitude toward government. \"Think about John Kennedy's famous 'ask not' lines here,\" Schneck says. \"For that generation of Catholics, it's a recognition that government and civil society have a profoundly positive role to play.\" But that generation now has moved on, says Robert George, a conservative Catholic and professor of jurisprudence at Princeton University. \"We have a younger generation of Catholics who are more conservative, especially on moral and cultural issues,\" he says. George says these younger Catholics \u2014 who are sometimes called \"intentional Catholics\" \u2014 tend to be more committed to conservative parts of Catholic doctrine. Many, like Ryan, 42, came of age during the papacy of John Paul II. They see themselves in Ryan, who opposes same-sex marriage and abortion except when the mother's life is in danger. In fact, Ryan sponsored a \"personhood bill\" that would define a fertilized egg as a human being. Hudson says he \"can't think of a better pick.\" He says Ryan is already mobilizing the conservative Catholic base. Conflict Over Role Of Government \"I think he strengthens the ticket from the point of view of the grass-roots, pro-life Catholics, who frankly do a lot of work in the campaign,\" he says. Many of these Ryan-esque Catholics, political scientists say, are more affluent and more likely to work in the executive suite than the factory floor. For example, Ryan's father was an attorney, and his family owns a paving company in Wisconsin. Like Ryan, many of these new Catholics take a dimmer view of taxes and social welfare policies. This might not seem like a religious issue, but Ryan made it one this spring. He told David Brody of the Christian Broadcasting Network that he found justification for his budget plan \u2014 which lowered taxes and cut services to the poor \u2014 in Catholic social teaching. \"The preferential option for the poor, which is one of the primary tenets of Catholic social teaching, means: Don't keep people poor; don't make people dependent on government so they stay stuck in their station in life,\" Ryan told CBN. \"Help people get out of poverty [and] on to a life of independence.\" The reaction from some Catholic theologians was swift and brutal. \"That's not the Jesus I know,\" says the Rev. Thomas Reese, a senior fellow at Georgetown University's Woodstock Theological Center. \"Jesus said we should feed the hungry, give drink to the thirsty, clothe the naked.\" Reese agrees that the Catholic principle of \"subsidiarity\" does favor the smaller units, such as families, churches or charities, solving problems. But it also sees a role for government \u2014 especially now, when so many people are out of work. \"A budget that cuts food stamps, that cuts Medicaid, can't be called a budget that follows Catholic social teaching of the Gospels,\" Reese says. Some influential Catholic bishops agreed, and publicly rebuked Ryan and his budget plan. Hudson says that put a big target on Ryan's back. \"The Catholic left was rubbing their hands with delight,\" he says, \"because they knew they had an attack line \u2014 that is, the bishops' criticism of the Ryan budget \u2014 an attack line they could use over and over again between now and November.\" In fact, the Obama campaign has already made Ryan's budget a centerpiece of its advertising campaign, airing ads about cutting benefits to veterans, loans to needy students and programs for the elderly, particularly Medicare. John Green, a political scientist at the University of Akron, says Catholics have never been so polarized. The divisions between liberal and conservative Catholics have been growing for decades, but this election has thrown it into sharp relief. But he says there are millions of Catholics who don't really fit into either camp: the swing Catholics. For them, religious and social issues take a back seat. \"Those moderate Catholics tend to respond to the economic situation much more so than more conservative Catholics or liberal Catholics who tend to be strong partisans,\" Green says These Catholics are concentrated in some swing states such as Pennsylvania, Ohio and parts of Florida. Now, they must choose between radically different views of governance \u2014 which both vice presidential candidates say are inspired by their faith.",

            "article_content": "Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney was in Miami, where he courted Cuban-American voters Monday. They're one of the few minority communities that vote solidly Republican. In a news conference Monday, Romney suggested voters don't care about a candidate's race.  DAVID GREENE, HOST: On a Tuesday, it's MORNING EDITION from NPR News. I'm David Greene. RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: And I'm Renee Montagne. Paul Ryan's addition to the Republican ticket brings a number of advantages, including youth and conservative credentials. One thing he doesn't add is racial diversity. Yesterday, Mitt Romney was campaigning in Florida, a state where more than a third of eligible voters are minorities. NPR's Ari Shapiro offers this look at whether a ticket of two white men is a disadvantage in 2012. ARI SHAPIRO, BYLINE: Most minority communities in the United States vote solidly Democratic. This is one major exception. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: (Spanish spoken) SHAPIRO: In the Little Havana neighborhood of Western Miami, El Palacio de los Jugos is an outdoor market and restaurant where local Cuban-Americans do their shopping. Yesterday afternoon, people drank free cups of fresh watermelon, papaya and other tropical fruit juice on ice. They tried to cool themselves with paper fans that said Juntos Con Romney - Together With Romney. When the candidate's bus rolled up, a Cuban-American from the neighborhood took the microphone, someone who also happens to be a Republican senator from Florida. SENATOR MARCO RUBIO: (Spanish spoken) SHAPIRO: This is the greatest country in the world, said Marco Rubio. RUBIO: (Foreign language spoken) SHAPIRO: There is not another community in this country who understands that better than this community. Rubio is a local favorite. He was widely considered a frontrunner to be on the ticket until Romney chose Paul Ryan, a Catholic from Wisconsin, instead. To Daniel Nyman, who's originally from Argentina, a candidate's race should make no difference. DANIEL NYMAN: Personally I don't look at a candidate's face or racial background. I just care what they're going to do for the country and if they have the right idea and the right philosophy. SHAPIRO: But he also believes that America is not race-blind. He agrees with the widely-held notion that Romney would have a much easier time winning Florida if he had chosen Rubio, because as a Latino, Rubio would bring Latino votes. And Nyman has his own explanation for that phenomenon. NYMAN: There are people who have no brains and they just vote based on people's racial background. SHAPIRO: Democrats say they don't get minority votes just by fielding minority candidates. Black people don't vote for President Obama just because he's black, they say. The ideals align. Democrats support immigration reform, affirmative action, poverty programs, as do many minority groups. But running minority candidates on a ticket is also way of saying: I relate to you, you're part of our group. At the Miami rally yesterday, Maria Marvado said her Republican Party didn't do enough of that for a long time. MARIA MARVADO: They definitely have to be more open to the Latino community. In the past, I think there has been a little bit of separation, but that's not true today. SHAPIRO: Republicans are working hard to expand their appeal. Several prominent people of color were given prime speaking slots at the party's national convention. But on the campaign trail, the Miami rally was an exception to the norm. At a typical Romney event, the crowd is a sea of white faces, and given the country's demographic trend lines, that could be a problem. WILLIAM FREY: I think it really is an issue in 2012 as the country is becoming more diverse. SHAPIRO: William Frey is a demographer at the Brookings Institution. Right now, he says, about 30 percent of American voters are not white. And that number is growing fast, as minorities have more kids at a younger age than whites. FREY: This may be the last hurrah for older whites in terms of being able to steer the direction of a presidential election. And even then it's sort of iffy, because a lot of the swing states are becoming much more minority. So if those states make a difference, which they probably will, this may not even be the last hurrah for whites. Maybe that last hurrah was elections ago. SHAPIRO: Mitt Romney disagrees. In a news conference yesterday, he suggested that voters don't care about a candidate's race. MITT ROMNEY: I think that we recognize people based upon their values and their capacity to get America on track. And I've picked the person who I believe is the right individual to help me if I become president. SHAPIRO: Today, Romney will campaign in Ohio, where the crowds are likely to look and sound very different from Miami. Ari Shapiro, NPR News, traveling with the Romney campaign.

            "article_content": "The Tug Valley Chamber of Commerce in Williamson, W.Va., is also home to The Coal House, built entirely of coal in 1933.\n                \n                    \n                    Noah Adams/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption The Tug Valley Chamber of Commerce in Williamson, W.Va., is also home to The Coal House, built entirely of coal in 1933. Mingo County, deep in the southwest corner of West Virginia, has sent a \"protest vote\" to the attention of President Obama. In the May 8 Democratic primary, voters chose a man named Keith Judd to run for president. He got 61 percent of the vote. Judd won't be available. He's serving a 17-year sentence for extortion. From prison in Texas, he managed to file the papers, pay the fee and get on the West Virginia ballot. Obama did win statewide, but Judd beat him in the coal mining region, where many believe the president is waging a \"War on Coal.\" In West Virginia, residents vote the way they want to vote: Republicans have won the state in the last three presidential elections. But the governor (Earl Ray Tomblin) and both U.S. senators (Jay Rockefeller and Joe Manchin) are Democrats. But still, how could a president running in his party's primary lose 10 counties to a guy in prison? The Answer: Coal The overwhelming issue in Mingo County is the future of coal mining. You will hear, see and read talk about \"Obama's War On Coal,\" people blaming the White House for mines shut down, coal-burning power plants shut down and jobs gone. Keith Judd, federal prisoner and \u2014 in West Virginia \u2014 a Democratic presidential candidate.\n                \n                    \n                    Beaumont Enterprise, courtesy of Keith Judd/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Keith Judd, federal prisoner and \u2014 in West Virginia \u2014 a Democratic presidential candidate. Leigh Ann Wells, who works for the Mingo County Commission, says she voted for Judd over Obama in the Democratic primary without knowing anything about Judd. When she arrived at home that night, the election results were on television. \"My husband was sitting on the couch and he said, 'You know that Judd guy who was on the ticket against Obama?' I said, 'Yeah.' He said, 'He's a felon in Texas. He's in jail,' \" says Wells, laughing. I talked with lots of people like Wells who would have tapped the voting screen for Judd even if they did know he was in prison \u2014 even if it meant the TV talk shows would make fun of West Virginia. \"It was a little bit embarrassing, and I don't care,\" says Wells. \"It was more so a stance against ... Obama and his coal policies and just the fact that here in West Virginia people feel like he doesn't even know we exist.\" The White House would say there's a push for coal, not a war against it. In his State of the Union address last year, Obama talked about energy sources, including natural gas and clean coal. \"We will need them all,\" the president said, promising more investment in coal technology. So maybe not a war \u2014 but there is a battle coming. And it's over the word \"clean\" in front of the word \"coal.\" The Culture Of Coal When you drive into Mingo County and first get out of the car, you'll smell coal in the air. After a day or so, you won't notice it. By the second night, you'll sleep without hearing the coal trains. But you always seem to be aware of the mountains, the hills, which are close in and all around. \"These very rugged mountains have isolated us,\" says Bill Richardson, a historian and Mingo County native. \"It even shaped the accent, because the old English accents didn't get blended away. It made people very clannish. They knew when there was a stranger in town because people didn't come here. It also made people very rugged and self-reliant. And still today, you see that people here don't want to be told what to do.\" About 27,000 people live in Mingo County, where the median household income is $32,902 a year, according to the 2010 U.S. Census. The county occupies 423 square miles. \"Go out to Dingess,\" people said, \"if you really want to see Mingo County.\" I drove way back in the country heading through an old railroad tunnel, almost a mile long, built for a rail line to carry lumber and people. The community called Dingess is a road through a winding, narrow valley, small houses along each side. The people who live here come from people who always lived here. To them, the coal trucks speeding by can be a friendly sound. \"That'n that was in prison? Against Obama? That's the one I voted for,\" says Wade Marcum, a retired coal miner. Marcum and his wife, Madge, say they worry about their retirement and jobs for their family and neighbors. \"The coal miners and that, they're upset over it 'cause [Obama's] not for coal, and that's what these people do, you know. That's all they know,\" says Madge. Farther along the Dingess Road in another front yard, I meet Sammy Vance. \"Obama, there. Hell, if he'd bend over a little backwards there to West Virginia and get that, what is that, EPA? Tell them to get on down the road, and hell with the lizard. Man needs to work,\" says Vance. Vance was referring to salamanders, which are often endangered by mining activity. County At A Crossroads At a crossroads called Lenore, there's a minimart, running busy all day with trucks driving through. A couple of old friends sit on a bench. Eugene Newsome says he will vote in the presidential election \u2014 but he won't stay with his party. \"I'm been a Democrat all my life, but I'm going to vote Republican this fall,\" says Newsome. His buddy, Lee Goff, says he's 100 percent behind the president, especially on clean air issues. \"He wants the power plants to go clean fuel, which that's common sense to do. He's doing what's right for the country, I believe,\" says Goff.

In this part of West Virginia and across the Tug Fork River in eastern Kentucky, there's a new measure of pride in the Hatfield-McCoy legend. A television miniseries on the History Channel has been stirring up tourism. It's about the 19th century family feud between two families that settled on either side of the Tug Fork. Outdoor sports tourism has also been bringing money into this part of West Virginia. The Hatfield-McCoy trail system was built for all-terrain vehicles. Sometimes you'll even ride on old coal mine access roads. The tourism money is encouraging for Mingo County. But this is a coal economy, sliding further away from any prosperity, losing out to natural gas and threatened by tough regulations that make coal more expensive to mine and burn. In June, the EPA held a public hearing in Pikeville, Ky., about an hour's drive from Mingo County. A lot of the Mingo County miners were there. The EPA, concerned about water quality in streams, has been delaying applications for some new mines. If you wanted to object to any of the EPA actions, you could stand and do so. Bobby May, chairman of the Republican Party of Buchanan County, across the border in Virginia, got applause when he stood and said: \"I'm gonna say something to all these miners assembled here tonight that you're not going to hear from Barack Hussein [Obama] and that's, 'God bless a coal miner.' ... 'Hussein' in Arabic means, 'I hate coal miners.' And folks, I want to say this to you tonight, that anybody that thinks that coal mining is ugly, just wait until you see poverty.\"",

Egyptians voted Saturday in the country's landmark presidential runoff, choosing between Hosni Mubarak's ex-prime minister and an Islamist candidate from the Muslim Brotherhood after a race that has deeply polarized the nation. After some unexpected political drama this week, Egyptians are choosing a president Saturday, and the choice reflects the deep divisions in the country that has been unsettled since its revolution last year. On the one side is Mohammed Morsi, candidate of the Muslim Brotherhood, the Islamic group that dominated the parliamentary elections back in December and January. His opponent in the runoff is Ahmed Shafiq, the last prime minister under Hosni Mubarak. Shafiq is seen as representing the old guard and the interests of the military, which has been calling the shots through a military council. The voting began smoothly with long lines reported at some polling stations in Cairo. Some 50 million Egyptians are eligible to vote Saturday and Sunday, and results are not expected until a day or two after the balloting ends. Until a couple days ago, it seemed the presidential runoff would provide some direction and stability for Egypt. The country would finally have an elected leader, along with an elected parliament, and could focus on the huge task of writing a new constitution and creating a new political system after decades of authoritarian rule. But this was all thrown into question when the country's Supreme Constitutional Court ruled on Thursday that at least some of the parliament was elected illegally and that the entire parliament should be dissolved. The court is packed with judges appointed by Mubarak, and many Egyptians saw it as an attempt by the old guard to undermine the rapidly rising Muslim Brotherhood and other Islamist groups. But Morsi said the court ruling should be respected, and while there were marches on Friday, there was no unrest, as some had feared. Still, the court ruling does complicate Egypt's politics. Some members of parliament have said they plan to meet as scheduled on Tuesday, despite the court decision. And parliament is responsible for writing the new constitution, which seems certain to be delayed. UPDATE at 10:21 am ET. Rumors Of Disappearing Ink: Egypt's parliamentary elections and the first-round of the presidential voting last month took place without any major hitches. But the court ruling has raised questions among some Egyptians about this election and the military's commitment to relinquishing power. The Associated Press reported there were rumors that voters were being given pen with ink that would disappear 30 minutes after they marked their ballots. Some Egyptians also feel that if Shafiq wins there will be doubts about the legitimacy of the polls due to his close ties to the ruling generals. In the first round last month, Shafiq came in just behind Morsi, with both getting close to a quarter of the overall vote. \"We didn't have a revolution to topple a regime that made us live in poverty and didn't treat us like human beings so we can bring it back,\" Mohammed Mustafa, a schoolteacher, told the AP as he waited in line to vote.",

            "article_content": "The long march to recall Governor Scott Walker is nearing its end, with Walker leading slightly in the polls and by a large margin in TV spending. The original dispute has turned into a broader gubernatorial election fight.  ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Robert Siegel. MELISSA BLOCK, HOST: And I'm Melissa Block. There's just a week to go before Wisconsin holds a recall election for governor, only the third in U.S. history. Republican incumbent Scott Walker faces Democrat Tom Barrett, the mayor of Milwaukee. And while Democrats forced this election, it's Barrett who finds himself playing catch-up. Wisconsin public radio's Shawn Johnson has the story. MAYOR TOM BARRETT: Hey, folks. Just want to say hello. I'm Tom Barrett. I'm running for governor. SHAWN JOHNSON, BYLINE: As musical blares from three stages at Madison's Brat Fest on Memorial Day weekend, Democrat Tom Barrett is going table to table saying hi to everyone that includes kids who are too young to vote for him. BARRETT: Hello, sir. Can you give me five? I love your glasses, man. I love your glasses. JOHNSON: It includes adults who won't vote for him. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: I know you are, and I'm voting for your opponent. (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER) BARRETT: OK. Well, nice to meet you. (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER) BARRETT: Tell him off. He's drinking too much. (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER) JOHNSON: And it includes a lot of people who voted for Barrett when he ran for governor the first time. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Hi, Tom. BARRETT: Nice to meet you. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: You have my vote again. BARRETT: OK. Thank you very, very much. I appreciate that. Nice to see you. JOHNSON: This is Barrett's way of drawing a contrast with Governor Scott Walker. BARRETT: I don't think he could come to an event like this without having people be very angry with him because of the steps that he's taken. JOHNSON: Democrats first started mulling the idea of a recall early last year after Walker introduced his bill that all but eliminated public sector collective bargaining laws. The surprise move sparked weeks of massive protests. But as the recall election draws near, Barrett wants voters to focus on something else: a criminal investigation into several former aides who worked with Walker when he was Milwaukee County executive. Barrett says Walker should release any emails connected to the probe and tell voters who's paying for his lawyers. BARRETT: He wants us to trust him on Election Day, but he won't trust us with this information that's really pretty basic information. JOHNSON: When Governor Walker speaks these days, he does not take a lot of chances. At one recent rally, in the highly Republican suburb of Waukesha, the crowd is packed with supporters who've come to hear him lay into Barrett. GOVERNOR SCOTT WALKER REPUBLICAN, WISCONSIN: It's hard to figure out what this election is about if you listen to our opponents, right, because it keeps changing. I mean, originally, it was about the reforms, right? But they don't talk about it anymore. Why? Because it's working. JOHNSON: Walker has also moved beyond the original labor issues in recent days, talking about employment, poverty and crime statistics in Milwaukee while Barrett's been mayor. WISCONSIN: I think it's time he focused on fixing Milwaukee not trying to screw up the rest of the state. (SOUNDBITE OF CHEERING) JOHNSON: The Republicans in this room are wild about their governor. Mary Pyasek(ph) voted for Walker the first time and views this recall as an attempt to take that vote away. MARY PYASEK: He's taken charge, no-nonsense, and I am sick of having my vote disenfranchised from 2010. JOHNSON: Walker backer Ken Milton says he knows the polls all show Walker ahead, but... KEN MILTON: No. Polls aren't elections. So I think we all know that we got to keep after it. JOHNSON: If there are undecided voters left in Wisconsin, they're getting lots of help making up their minds as TV ads crowd the airwaves. So far, Republicans have dominated, says Mike McCabe of the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign, a group that tracks campaign spending. MIKE MCCABE: Bottom line is that Republican groups came in much earlier, spent much more heavily and don't show any signs of letting up. JOHNSON: McCabe expects Democrats could spend as much as Republicans in the closing weeks of the campaign. But McCabe says they won't close the gap. They're being outspent three to one.

            "article_content": "In Las Vegas Thursday, Mitt Romney picked up the endorsement of multimillionaire businessman Donald Trump. Trump's endorsement comes one day after the former Massachusetts governor stirred up controversy \u2014 on the left and the right \u2014 by saying he's \"not concerned about the very poor.\"  MELISSA BLOCK, HOST: From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Melissa Block. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: And I'm Audie Cornish. Mitt Romney picked up an endorsement today from a man who was once at the top of the presidential polls - even though he was never officially running for president. (SOUNDBITE OF ANNOUNCEMENT) DONALD TRUMP: Governor Romney, go out and get him. You can do it. (SOUNDBITE OF CHEERING, APPLAUSE) MITT ROMNEY: Thank you, thank you. CORNISH: In Las Vegas, Romney enthusiastically received the endorsement of real estate mogul, and reality TV star, Donald Trump. As NPR's Ari Shapiro reports, the timing could have been better. ARI SHAPIRO, BYLINE: In front of six American flags, workers polished a gleaming plaque saying Trump International Hotel Las Vegas. It sparkled just so in the TV lights. (SOUNDBITE OF ANNOUNCMENT) TRUMP: Mitt is tough. He's smart. He's sharp. He's not going to allow bad things to continue to happen to this country that we all love. SHAPIRO: Donald Trump's endorsement is one that all of the candidates in the race were fighting for. But for Romney, it's an awkward moment to get the blessing of a man who embodies opulence and conspicuous consumption. Romney is still taking flak for this comment he made on CNN yesterday. (SOUNDBITE OF CNN BROADCAST) ROMNEY: I'm not concerned about the very poor. We have a safety net there. If it needs repair, I'll fix it. I'm not concerned about the very rich. They're doing just fine. I'm concerned about the very heart of America. SHAPIRO: At first, the criticism was along the lines of, Romney made a gaffe. Now, people are looking under the surface and questioning the substance of his policy positions - both Democrats and Republicans. At Trump Hotel, Romney did not mention poverty at all. But across town, at a manufacturing plant, rival Newt Gingrich was not letting him off the hook. NEWT GINGRICH: I really believe that we should care about the very poor - unlike Governor Romney. SHAPIRO: In Gingrich's view, the problem goes beyond Romney saying that he does not care about the very poor. GINGRICH: Both Governor Romney and Barack Obama seem to believe that a quote, safety net, is all the poor need. I don't believe that. What the poor need is a trampoline, so they can spring up, and quit being poor. (SOUNDBITE OF CHEERING, APPLAUSE) SHAPIRO: Conservatives have argued for a long time that the safety net does not help the poor; it keeps them poor. To those critics, when Romney says he wants to repair the safety net, he sounds like he's siding with liberals. Erick Ericson is editor of the website redstate.com. ERICK ERICSON: He's perfectly happy to leave the safety net alone instead of, from a conservative's perspective, trying to elevate the poor into the middle class. SHAPIRO: House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan has warned that the safety net is becoming a hammock, which lulls able-bodied people into lives of complacency and dependency. But Romney supports Paul Ryan's budget plan. Poverty experts say that plan, and the other policies Romney endorses, do not repair the safety net at all despite Romney's claims. Beth Mattingly is director of research on vulnerable families at the University of New Hampshire's Carsey Institute. BETH MATTINGLY: It appears to me, by and large, that a lot of those proposals aim to weaken - rather than strengthen - the social safety net by providing less funding, by really trying to restrict eligibility, restrict access. SHAPIRO: She also says the numbers Romney cites are way off. In his CNN interview, he said if you set aside the very rich and very poor... (SOUNDBITE OF CNN BROADCAST) ROMNEY: I'm concerned about the very heart of America - the 90, 95 percent of Americans who right now, are struggling. MATTINGLY: That is certainly not an accurate breakdown of those who are in poverty. SHAPIRO: Mattingly says the federal government's definition of poverty includes about 15 percent of Americans. But when you look at those who depend on the social safety net, the numbers are far higher. MATTINGLY: When you consider all of the non-cash safety net programs, as well as all of the work-related and whatnot expenses, it comes up to over a third. SHAPIRO: Perhaps most relevant to Romney's hopes of becoming president: His views on poverty may not sit well with some voters in his own party. Roughly a quarter of Republican voters have annual family incomes under $30,000. According to a poll by the Pew Research Center, 57 percent of them believe the government does not do enough for poor people in this country. Ari Shapiro, NPR News, Las Vegas.

The cast, winnowed to five after some recent  departures, had their lines memorized but included enough improv to keep  the show fresh.  Some lines were borrowed from the Democrats. Newt Gingrich used one  we've heard from David Axelrod, President Barack Obama's political  adviser, that when Mitt Romney was governor, Massachusetts was 47th for  job creation. We rated that Half True. Gingrich criticized Obama for the growth in food stamps, calling him  \"the best food stamp president in American history.\" He later said that  \"the fact is that more people have been put on food stamps by Barack  Obama than any president in American history.\" We've rated that Half True because the number was headed upward before Obama became president.  Ron Paul emphasized the need to reduce the American military presence  overseas and noted that despite that position he still got the most  contributions from people in the military. \"I get twice as much money  from the from the active military duties than all the other candidates  put together,\" he said. PolitiFact Texas checked that back in July and rated it True.  Romney was critical of Obama's trade policy, saying, \"This president  has opened up no new markets for American goods around the world in his  three years, even as European nations and China have opened up 44.\"   We've rated that False.  Rick Santorum cited the value of marriage, a high school diploma and a  job at fighting poverty. We've checked the marriage angle and gave it a Half True.  Romney repeated a line that we've heard from many Republicans: \"Don't  forget who it was that cut Medicare by $500 billion, and that was  President Obama to pay for Obamacare.\" We've examined that many times  and found that the Democratic health care law cut $500 billion out  of Medicare to pay for Obamacare. That has earned a Half True.  Gingrich criticized ads from a pro-Romney superPAC that claimed he  co-sponsored a bill with Nancy Pelosi that supported China's one-child  policy. Gingrich called it \"an absurdity.\" We called it Pants on Fire.",

The dynamic duo of PBS host Tavis Smiley and professor/activist Cornel West was at it again in Washington Thursday evening during a live television broadcast of a program addressing poverty. The two have made a traveling roadshow out of their roles as the loudest African-American critics of President Obama. The forum, presented and moderated by Smiley and aired on C-SPAN, follows Smiley and West's 18-city tour last summer that called attention to the growing number of Americans in poverty, particularly blacks. During the tour, and at the original poverty forum last year, Smiley and West became lightning rods for accusing Obama of failing to adequately address problems affecting blacks. But for 2 1/2 hours on Thursday, Smiley and West made few waves for the president. It was several other panelists who expressed their dissatisfaction with Obama, including Academy Award-winning filmmaker Michael Moore. Moore said the president's term has \"been a disappointing three years. ... He thought he would be a nice guy. He turned the other cheek. ... Right now, we don't need a nice guy. We need someone who will stand up and kick some butt for his country.\" The program is scheduled to re-air on PBS's Tavis Smiley show for three straight nights, from Jan. 16 to Jan. 18. Smiley did finally steer the panelists into questions about Obama's leadership about an hour into the program. \"Black people right now are catching hell,\" Smiley said. \"Yet, to my mind, black people, lovingly and respectfully, are the most silent about the hell that they are catching.\" Appearing to sense that another Smiley attack was coming, many in the audience began to murmur and shift in their seats. Smiley, appearing to take in the audience's rumblings, instead posed a painstakingly qualified question to one panelist: \"Now, I'm not naive about this. I understand why that is \u2014 because of our love of, our deference and support, legitimately, of Barack Hussein Obama as president and the effort to get him elected. But I do want to put this out there: What happens if we continue to be as silent as we are? I'm not saying the president has got to be demonized. I'm not saying this to cast aspersions on him; I am saying that when the people catching the most hell are enduring that in silence, it raises a question, to me, as to what the pain threshold really is for black folk.\" Panelist Roger A. Clay, president of the Oakland, Calif.-based Insight Center for Community Economic Development, responded: Since Smiley and West turned up the heat on Obama last year, many African-Americans have debated the question of how to hold the president accountable \u2014 without appearing to embolden his political enemies. At the same time, as Obama's support has dropped among nonblacks, blacks themselves remain his most loyal constituency. Smiley and West have beaten back a constant backlash from prominent African-Americans, including the Rev. Al Sharpton and popular talk radio host Tom Joyner, for remarks they argued were needlessly divisive. But it wasn't entirely clear how their criticism of Obama was playing among the average African-American until last week, when Smiley was dropped as the keynote speaker for an upcoming Martin Luther King holiday luncheon in Peoria, Ill. The cancellation came in response to a handful of retired black women who wrote an op-ed letter in the local newspaper objecting to the selection of Smiley and demanding a refund of their $40-a-plate ticket. The local NAACP followed suit, as did other would-be attendees. Event organizers replaced Smiley with radio host and professor Michael Eric Dyson (who also has criticized Obama at times, though far more gently). Smiley reportedly was to be paid $37,500 for the speech. Reacting to the snub, Smiley told Fox News on Monday that just six people complained, \"trumping the entire event.\" He called it a \"quintessential example of political correctness.\" \"The implication of what Tavis and Cornel West say is essentially that  the president has let the black community down. We just don't agree with  that,\" the author of the op-ed letter, Barbara Penelton, a retired professor at Bradley University, told me in an interview. \"We recognize a lot of things he's wanted to do has not occurred,  but that doesn't mean we withdraw our support.\" \"We know Tavis is concerned about the poverty rate, and we think there still is more to be done,\" Penelton continued. \"But we have too many people who are lukewarm about voting to discourage them from continuing to support the president.\" \"The bottom line is I am not going to spend money to hear somebody bash the president,\" she said. Stay tuned for more debate: Penelton says she has accepted an invitation to be a guest on the \"Smiley & West\" public radio show on Tuesday.",

Update Dec. 23, at 5:30 a.m.: Egypt's constitution appears to have passed with 64 percent of Egyptians voting \"yes,\" according to preliminary results issued by state-run media. But the document passed under a cloud of controversy as the opposition to the Islamist-backed document cried fraud. Once official results are announced, President Mohammed Morsi is expected to give up his all-inclusive powers. A set of controversial decrees he issued last month, that effectively put him above the law, will be void when the constitution is adopted. He is also expected to hand over legislative powers to the upper house of parliament until a new lower house is elected and assumes its role as the legislature. He appointed 90 members to the upper house of parliament, including 12 Christians and eight women, in an apparent bid to calm the opposition who have accused Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood of dominating all political institutions. The passage of the constitution is a victory for the embattled president after four weeks of political turmoil and intermittent violence centered on his rule. He comes out of this battle scarred, however, and observers say he has lost all support of revolutionary forces and building national consensus in the future will be difficult. The country is more polarized than ever and the vote on the constitution was marred by low turnout and claims of fraud. Our original post continues below: Egyptians voted late into the night Saturday on an Islamist-backed constitution that has polarized the nation. There seemed to be no question that the document would pass, bolstering embattled President Mohammed Morsi, who hails from the historic Muslim Brotherhood. Opponents of the constitution say Egypt will remain unstable if the charter becomes law. They say they will continue to protest the Muslim Brotherhood, Egypt's new powerhouse. The battle lines on the referendum have hardened, and in many ways the vote has morphed from a choice on a document to a referendum on the Brotherhood itself. In the poor district of Imbaba, a neighborhood in the Giza district of greater Cairo, the nation's divisions were literally written on the wall. Scrawling black graffiti tags urged people to vote no to the constitution. Well-designed posters from the Muslim Brotherhood's campaign were hastily pasted up nearby. Teacher Nadi Fouad, 42, patiently waited in a block-long line to vote. Dressed in a dapper suit, he said he planned to vote yes for the constitution and yes to stability. In the end, he said, the opposition will accept the results, the same way Egyptians accepted a divisive result during the presidential elections. \"They will opt for democracy, even if they appear to be harsh and revolutionary now,\" he said. A man nearby jeered, \"Where is Morsi now?\" Fellow revolutionaries no longer feel sympathy for the once-oppressed group now that it has become Egypt's ruling party. Now they are mobilizing against the group, criticizing it for forgetting about human rights and reform. But the organization and efficiency that the Brotherhood has consistently shown in Egypt's nearly two-year transition has so far eluded all other political and revolutionary forces. \"I will vote no and we will see the results,\" Nour Osama, a 19-year-old law student, said at a polling station in Giza. But she said she knows that this constitution will pass. Many who agree with her have given up already and aren't voting. \"The Brotherhood are a majority of Egypt. All of them are going to vote and on our side some of us are going to vote and others are staying home,\" she said. \"They will win. But the revolution will carry on, we will protest again and again and again.\" Early results of the first phase of the two-part vote last weekend showed a majority voting for the constitution. Revolutionary groups reported some violations during the voting process, although there were no substantiated claims of systemic fraud. The turmoil of the last four weeks, since Morsi issued a decree that effectively put him above the law until a new constitution is in place, sparked many critics to call the president a new dictator. The constitution being voted on was adopted by a largely Islamist body. Most others involved in drafting the document withdrew in protest over what they say is a constitution that fails to abolish military trials for civilians, effectively limit the powers of the president and protect minority rights \u2014 all while slightly expanding the role of Islam in Egypt. Morsi's decisions were a catalyst for mass protests and some of those turned violent, leaving Brotherhood members and opponents dead in clashes. Critics of the Brotherhood accuse the organization of using Mubarak-era tactics, sending thugs to attack critics. In a twist late Saturday, Egypt's vice president resigned. Mahmoud Mekki, a judge who long fought for the independence of the judiciary, said he'd planned to resign earlier but couldn't due to the political climate. In the past month he has defended Morsi's policies and called for national dialogue. He steps down just as it appears that the position of vice president will be eliminated in a new constitution. On Saturday, most people interviewed said they are tired \u2014 tired of political jockeying, the battles over politics and the protests. They just want a little stability. Walid Mahmoud Ashri, a mechanic in the neighborhood of Dokki in greater Cairo, said he just wants it over. He voted yes to the constitution and hopes that means that soon Egyptians' real problems will be addressed \u2014 security, unemployment and poverty. \"During the days of Mubarak, yes, he stole from us, but there was stability, safety, there was no terrorism,\" he said. \"There are many people who haven't received their rights \u2014 workers, those who are not employed, these people don't have rights, and these are the majority of the people.\" Results are expected as early as Sunday.",

Read Another Perspective On Romney's 47 Percent Comments. A few random thoughts (and some reporting) on Mitt Romney and the video. First, what Mitt Romney was getting at \u2013 as opposed to what he actually said \u2013 is undeniably true as a broad observation: too many Americans are dependent, or partially dependent, on an expansive government. It's morally corrosive and fiscally unsustainable. Even as Romney's campaign to date has focused almost exclusively on the short-term economy and unemployment rates, many conservatives have urged him to place this very basic truth at the center of his campaign. In that sense, it's understandable that some Romney supporters are enthusiastic about the fact that it ended up there \u2013 however unintentional and however awkwardly. But Romney's statement is wrong in many of its particulars \u2014 the 47 percent are not all dependent on government, they don't all think of themselves as victims, and they're certainly not all Obama supporters. What happened, it seems, is that Romney combined a political argument with a substantive one. For months, Romney has been providing donors at these fundraisers with a version of what he said on the videotape. But, according to those who have heard him in these settings, he usually keeps his comments focused on politics. Romney tells donors that Obama will get 47 percent of the vote nationally regardless of what he does \u2013 those are the president's locked-in voters. Romney's share, he explains, is somewhere slightly below that number \u2013 he often uses 45 percent \u2013 and the election is essentially a battle for the rest. The charitable view of Romney's comments, then, is that he was simply musing aloud about his electoral prospects and got carried away. But politicians are not judged on what they meant. It's what they say that matters. And Romney here seems to be articulating a deeply pessimistic view of America and what makes it great. \"There are 47 percent of the people who will vote for the president no matter what. All right, there are 47 percent who are with him, who are dependent upon government, who believe that they are victims, who believe the government has a responsibility to care for them, who believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you-name-it. That that's an entitlement. And the government should give it to them. And they will vote for this president no matter what....These are people who pay no income tax.... [M]y job is not to worry about those people. I'll never convince them they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives.\" Those last two sentences are especially troubling. Romney seems to believe that those who are sucking at the public teat are forever destined to do so. \"My job is not to worry about those people. I'll never convince them that they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives.\" He is not saying that he'll never convince these people that they should vote for him. He says, without qualification, that he'll never convince them to take personal responsibility and care for their lives. If Romney truly believes that, then he shouldn't be running for president. If he is elected, one of his most important jobs will be to convince the American public, particularly those who have become too reliant on government, that they need to take personal responsibility for their lives. But maybe Romney really does believe that nearly half of the country is irredeemable. There are echoes in Romney's videotaped comments of Romney's statement that he's not worried about the \"very poor\" because they have a safety net. The very foundation of the American promise is upward mobility \u2014 the idea that anyone can succeed if he works hard enough to do so. This was, not incidentally, one of the major themes at the Republican convention in Tampa, with one speaker after another parading to the podium to share a story about his or her rise from poverty, etc. And it's one of the main reasons that many movement conservatives are movement conservatives. What Romney says here \u2014 and earlier \u2014 suggests a view that the poor are consigned to their stations in life forever and that their only hope is the government. That sounds instead like something that President Obama might say \u2014 and indeed has come close to saying. \"I'm always struck by people who think, well, it must be because I was just so smart,\" he said in the \"context\" to his \"you didn't build that\" comment. \"There are a lot of smart people out there. It must be because I worked harder than everybody else. Let me tell you something \u2014 there are a whole bunch of hardworking people out there. If you were successful, somebody along the line gave you some help.\" Both views, in their own way, minimize the importance of hard work. Romney seems to think that those dependent on government are hopeless because they'll never take personal responsibility; Obama thinks they can succeed only with government help and that no one succeeds without government help. What are the political implications of the tape? One effect will be to amplify the Obama campaign portrayal of Romney as an uncaring rich guy. It's hard to say whether that will matter much. They've been hard at work at defining Romney that way for months and one suspects that most of those who accept that view or Romney were not likely to vote for him anyway. Could it fire up conservatives? Perhaps. Some conservatives have already declared that they like this Mitt Romney better than the cautious, programmed one they've seen in public campaign events. They seem willing to look beyond the problems with what Romney actually said in their eagerness to embrace what they hope he meant. The best case scenario is one in which Romney takes this gaffe, which was a rejection of the optimism that animates reform conservatism, and uses it to turn his campaign into an ideological critique of Barack Obama and an embrace of the bold solutions that give shape to reform conservatism. Will it happen? \"Politics is like sports,\" Romney's chief strategist Stuart Stevens told Politico over the weekend. \"A lot of people have ideas, and there's no right or wrong. You just have to chart a course, and stay on that course.\" Really? If the course you're on isn't working, maybe you'd better adjust.",

Barry Malone lived in Ethiopia for almost five years and was Reuters correspondent there until November 2010. I once asked Ethiopia's Prime Minister Meles Zenawi, who died on Aug. 20 from an unspecified illness at age 57, whether he was a dictator. He grinned and then, stopping, just looked at me. Nervously, I did what a journalist should never do, and filled the silence. \"A lot of people call you that,\" I said. He told me he didn't care much what foreigners thought and that the people who described him that way were rarely his countrymen. \"If Ethiopians thought that I was what you say, I would not sleep at night,\" he said. \"But I don't believe they do.\" I persisted that there were indeed Ethiopians who called him a dictator and that they often gathered to protest his trips overseas \u2014 where, with his ferocious intellect, charm, and ability to speak in perfect paragraphs, he was regularly a star at meetings of the G-20 or in the snowy mountains of Davos. Looking uncomfortable, he admitted that their presence saddened him. \"We may be at fault in some way,\" he said, as my pen started scratching with greater speed, anticipating a rare confession from a man usually so sure of himself. \"I am sorry,\" he said. \"That maybe we didn't communicate well enough to those Ethiopians living abroad what is happening. What we are doing here.\" Meles was not your typical one-dimensional African strongman \u2014 a term often applied to him by the Western media but one that seemed somehow lazily old-fashioned and patronizing, jarring uncomfortably with his bookish demeanour. Meles came to power as one of a group of men who led a rebel coalition that overthrew brutish communist dictator, Mengistu Haile Mariam \u2014 a man who killed, by most estimates, hundreds of thousands of people in anti-opposition purges. There is no evidence that power was something Meles craved simply to line his pockets, though the financial dealings of Ethiopia's ruling party are sometimes questionable. No private jets, Paris homes, or yachts decked out with shark tanks for this African leader. Instead, friends said, on the very rare days when he wasn't working, he liked to play a bit of tennis, chat about political events outside Ethiopia, and dress down in sweatpants and sneakers to eat and drink with a small circle of family and confidantes. He was a man on a different mission. What he was \"doing here\" was pursuing a vision, what he called the \"Ethiopian Renaissance.\" But he didn't like people getting in his way. \"He loved Ethiopia and was proud of its long history,\" a Western academic who had regular email correspondence with him told me. \"He wanted to restore it to glory.\" *** In the early hours of Sept. 12, 2007, Meles, decked out in traditional dress, stood to give one of the most important speeches of his premiership so far. It had just turned midnight and Ethiopia, which follows a calendar long abandoned by the West, had entered its new millennium with fireworks and tooting car horns across Addis Ababa. \"We cannot but feel deeply insulted that, at the dawn of the new millennium, ours is one of the poorest countries in the world,\" he said, adding that \"the darkness of poverty and backwardness\" had dimmed the country's once proud and powerful reputation. \"A thousand years from now, when Ethiopians gather to welcome the fourth millennium, they shall say the eve of the third millennium was the beginning of the end of the dark ages in Ethiopia,\" he said to an ululating crowd. The speech was not only important because of the ambitious vision it outlined, but because it took place just two years after the episode that will likely overshadow his achievements more than any other \u2014 the disastrous and bloody 2005 general elections. It's hard to overstate the fervor of that campaign. Ethiopians who had never lived in a democracy before were promised their first properly contested poll since Meles and his allies sent Mengistu fleeing to exile in Zimbabwe. In the end, when Meles declared that his party had won a parliamentary majority, the opposition screamed fraud. In ensuing street riots, his police and soldiers killed almost 200 Ethiopians, most shot dead. Some were beaten to death. The reaction from Meles was cold. He was sorry for the deaths, he said, but he'd simply told the security forces to \"stop the insurrection.\" These were not normal demonstrations, he insisted. Afterwards, opposition leaders were rounded up and jailed. With the opposition out of the way, along with several journalists, he ploughed on with the day-to-day running of government. His economic achievements, and his role as an opponent of Islamism in the Horn of Africa, pleased Western donors, most of whom usually offered little more than a temporary slap on the wrist. That's not to say that Meles's attempts at reform were all mere window-dressing. The premier and his government did much to let the light in. Under his watch, a safety-net system \u2014 a form of social welfare, he called it \u2014 for the country's millions of hungry people was introduced, which, while unsuccessful at weaning them off foreign aid, ensured that the calamitous famine of 1984 and 1985 would never be repeated. Economic successes continued even after the political turmoil of the 2005 elections. Under the leadership of this former Marxist guerrilla, Ethiopia became one of the fastest growing economies not only in Africa but in the world, posting double-digit growth figures for the last seven years in a row. Infant mortality plummeted. A small middle class emerged. Roads were built. Rivers dammed. Villages electrified. Despite this undeniable progress, most Ethiopians remained poor \u2014 something Meles insisted he was working toward eradicating with a series of five-year plans. Masterful at dealing with Western governments, he cleverly played off their own security concerns and their rivalry with China and India, to which he also cozied up. There were few African leaders who could berate their donor countries while simultaneously holding out their palm for more aid money, but Meles had the chutzpah to carry it off. These achievements are even more remarkable given the fact that, according to a Western intelligence officer who knew Meles when he was still a bush rebel and after he came to power, the premier entered office knowing almost nothing about economics. \"When I had my final conversation with him after spending the better part of two months in Ethiopia immediately after he took over in the summer of 1991, I asked Meles what he would like me to do to help him before I left,\" the man recounted. \"I need to learn something about economics,\" Meles told him. \"Can you get me some basic books?\" The intelligence officer then went to an embassy, looked through its library, and picked about a dozen volumes and had them delivered to the new leader. Meles eventually sat for a long-distance learning degree from Britain's Open University. He came in a remarkable third in his graduating class despite studying while governing one of Africa's most populated countries (friends say he chain-smoked through the exams). Such was Meles's command of economic theory in later years that the former guerrilla, who had in fact dropped out of medical school at 19 to join the rebellion, was often mistakenly believed by some journalists and diplomats to have been studying economics.

            "article_content": "Following last year's revolution in Tunisia, moderate Islamists now head the government in Tunis. While many Tunisians say hard-line Islamists threaten the country's nascent democracy, others worry the economy is being ignored.  RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: This MORNING EDITION from NPR News. Good morning, I'm Renee Montagne with David Greene. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: And I'm Steve Inskeep on the Revolutionary Road, traveling through nations of the Arab Spring, from Carthage to Cairo. Let's take one more look this morning at Tunisia. It does not have Libya's oil or Egypt's vast population. But it does have one thing of special interest. Analysts think Tunisia is the best test of whether an Islamist democracy can actually work. As we've heard in recent days, Tunisians are jostling over what kind of new rules they want to write for their society. Many of the decisions in the end will belong to an Islamist party that won last year's elections in Tunisia. NPR's Eleanor Beardsley looks at the role of that party, called Ennahda. (SOUNDBITE OF SINGING) ELEANOR BEARDSLEY, BYLINE: The call to prayer resounds across the twisting alleys of the Medina, the oldest part of Tunis. Tunisia is a Muslim country, but it has long been known for its tolerance. It has welcomed tourists and trade from Europe for centuries. But now, many secular Tunisians worry that those traditions are changing. Jihene Bouhadra runs the newly remodeled El Ali Cultural Cafe in the Medina. JIHENE BOUHADRA: Tunisians are very moderate. We are Muslim, yes. And we are open to other cultures. We are open to other minds. We are open to other religions. We have been always moderate. So we are surprised - today we are surprised to see such a people who are very closed-minded, I think. (SOUNDBITE OF PROTEST) BEARDSLEY: Bouhadra is talking about a new phenomenon in Tunisia, outspoken ultra-conservative Muslims known as Salafists, like this group that gathered recently in the city of Kairouan. Bands of Salafists pushing for the imposition of Islamic law have been roaming the country, forcing bars and restaurants that sell alcohol to close and threatening women who don't cover their heads with a veil. Until now, Tunisian women have enjoyed near equal status with men. Some fear that could change if the Salafists get their way. Many Tunisians say Ennahda - the moderate Islamist party that now heads the government - has not cracked down sufficiently on the radicals. Faycal Nacer is a spokesman for the party. FAYCAL NACER: (Through translator) The Salafists are not from Jupiter. They're Tunisians and they have the right to exist and express themselves. And if they're extreme it's because they're victims of the old dictatorship. So we're using dialogue to convince them to become part of the democratic and political process. BEARDSLEY: Many secular Tunisians accuse Ennahda of double talk. They believe the so-called moderate Islamists are actually working with the extremists to make society more conservative. As the debate rages on over the role of Islam in the new Tunisia, the country's most glaring problem, the economy, doesn't seem to be getting any better. (SOUNDBITE OF PROTEST) BEARDSLEY: Hundreds of jobless university graduates protested recently in front of the main courthouse in downtown Tunis. Unemployment is officially at 18 percent. But analysts say it may actually be twice that number. And much of the country is mired in poverty. Protestor Beshar Messaoud says the government is a huge disappointment. BESHAR MESSAOUD: (Foreign language spoken) BEARDSLEY: A year and a half after the revolution, things are exactly the same, he says. This government has brought no solutions to the problems that led to the revolution in the first place. LOTFI BEN SASSI: People want to work, want a job. And they give them not a job, but God and religion. We are Muslim, we have Islam. We don't need Islam. We need jobs. We need development. BEARDSLEY: That's political cartoonist Lotfi Ben Sassi. He says if the economy doesn't improve soon, the moderate Islamists will be out on their ears at the next election. (SOUNDBITE OF CROWD CHATTER) BEARDSLEY: A few days ago in La Marsa, a chic suburb of Tunis, residents faced off with a group of Salafists who wanted to close down an art show because it allegedly promoted homosexuality. The two sides yelled at each other on the sidewalk. Thirty-five-year-old Laila Turki watched the scene from a cafe. She said these fights won't get Tunisia anywhere. LAILA TURKI: Of course I feel nervous about the economy, about tourists. I want people to come invest in Tunisia. And I want people to keep coming here. I want to see Americans, I want to see French. I want to see everybody coming here, you know? BEARDSLEY: Turki says if Tunisia doesn't get its act together and improve its economy quickly, it will undermine its chances to build a functioning democracy. Eleanor Beardsley, NPR News.

Panama is experiencing record economic growth, but many fear the benefits aren't trickling down to the poor. \n                \n                    \n                    Rodrigo Arangua/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Tourists visit the San Felipe neighborhood in Panama City in December 2011. Panama is experiencing record economic growth, but many fear the benefits aren't trickling down to the poor. The Central American nation of Panama is booming. Fueled by a multibillion-dollar expansion of the Panama Canal, a thriving banking industry and capital flight from Venezuela, the tiny nation has the highest economic growth rate in the hemisphere. But even as the government builds a subway system and markets the country as a tropical paradise for multinational corporations, not everyone is sharing in the prosperity. We still have two countries \u2014 a First World country that's going gangbusters, and a half an hour away, a Fourth World country with too many poor people. Roberto Eisenmann, founder of 'La Prensa' newspaper These days, Panama City is a giant construction site. Roads are being torn up. Excavators are digging out tunnels while cranes above put the finishing touches on new high-rise condominiums, office towers, banks and hotels. On the south side of the Panama Canal, just across the Bridge of the Americas, a former U.S. military base is being converted into a mixed-use residential, corporate and industrial park called Panama Pacifico. \"We have already built close to 100,000 square meters' worth of warehouses and we're building another 50,000 square meters that should be done by the end of the year,\" says Juan McKay of London & Regional, the master developer of the project. McKay's company is transforming what used to be the U.S. Howard Air Force Base into a sprawling campus with corporate offices, manufacturing and logistics facilities. Dell Computer has already set up a call center on the campus. On a recent day, McKay stands where the heavy equipment giant Caterpillar is building a new regional hub. \"Caterpillar is obviously looking for a strategic position in Latin America that will make them very easy to go anywhere,\" McKay says. A Boom, But For Whom? McKay and others are touting Panama as the place to do business in Latin America right now. It has five major shipping ports clustered at either end of the canal. The country has a sophisticated banking sector. Also, there isn't the drug violence that's been plaguing Mexico and Central America. Last year, according to the government's statistic agency, economic growth in Panama hit 10.5 percent, indicating that this country of 3.5 million people is expanding faster than China. But the boom isn't benefiting everyone. As shiny Porsches and chrome-tinted Hummers race along the new coastal boulevard, roughly one-third of Panamanians still live in poverty. \"From my perspective, the major challenge Panama has is the economic and social polarization,\" says Roberto Eisenmann, founder of the Panama City daily newspaper La Prensa. \"We still have two countries \u2014 a First World country that's going gangbusters, and a half an hour away, a Fourth World country with too many poor people,\" Eisenmann says. Panama is also a young democracy that's still struggling to emerge from the dictatorship of Manuel Noriega in the 1980s. The current president, Ricardo Martinelli, won the 2009 elections by a landslide. But following a series of corruption scandals, his popularity has plummeted. Miguel Antonio Bernal, a constitutional law professor at the University of Panama, says Martinelli's authoritarian administration is running roughshod over the rule of law to attract more foreign investment while ignoring the needs of ordinary Panamanians. This photo from Dec. 21, 2011, shows construction of new locks on the Panama Canal, in Cocoli, Panama.\n                \n                    \n                    Juan Jose Rodriguez/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption This photo from Dec. 21, 2011, shows construction of new locks on the Panama Canal, in Cocoli, Panama. \"At any time we are going to have a social explosion that will be very dangerous. Not only for us, the Panamanian people, but also for the economic interests and investments that are already in the country,\" Bernal says. Development, Preservation Clash On a recent night, a new boutique hotel in the hip, historic Casco Viejo area of Panama City is holding its opening. At the door, a bouncer checks people's names against a guest list on an iPad. Disco lights flash across the four-story atrium. At the bar, young women laugh; the rooftop deck looks out on the cobblestone streets below. The Spanish founded Casco Viejo in 1673, after pirates sacked an earlier settlement farther up the coast, nearly destroying it totally. Standing on the seawall of the old city, Patrizia Pinzon, a local real estate agent and activist with the Casco Viejo Neighborhood Association, says this area now faces threats from development. The Martinelli administration proposes building an elevated freeway in the harbor. \"It would be six lines of highway on the water, around the historic district, that would connect with the other side of Panama City, the area where all the high-rises are right now,\" Pinzon says. Pinzon says a freeway just offshore, encircling Casco Viejo, would destroy the historic character of the neighborhood and put its designation as a UNESCO World Heritage site in jeopardy. In the 22 years since the U.S. deposed Noriega, governmental institutions and civic groups have been gaining strength slowly but steadily in Panama. The recent boom, however, and the election of the pro-growth Martinelli, Pinzon says, have changed things. \"With this administration, it seems like we are just going back [in time],\" Pinzon says, referring to when the government catered only to the demands of the wealthy and powerful. After her anger cools over talking about the proposed highway on the water, Pinzon is more philosophical about Panama's growing pains. Smiling as if she's describing a favorite niece, she says Panama right now is like a beautiful 15-year-old girl who's pretty but doesn't believe she's pretty. She bleaches her dark hair blond to try to get the whole world to like her, Pinzon says. But despite herself, her beauty and all her potential are still there.",

Read Another Opinion On The Affordable Care Act Jonathan Cohn is senior editor at The New Republic. Next week the Supreme Court hears oral arguments in the lawsuits challenging the Affordable Care Act. But is it really the \"case of the century,\" as pundits have started calling it? It's difficult to say without knowing the outcome. Presently that distinction belongs to Bush v. Gore, a decision that truly altered history. Just think how the years after 2001 would have unfolded if Al Gore had been president. But Bush v. Gore didn't change constitutional doctrine. The five justices voting to end the Florida recount and make Bush president wrote that their argument was \"limited to the present circumstances\" \u2014 in other words, that they were not making broader arguments about federal power over elections and interpretation of the equal protection clause. That claim provoked widespread derision within the legal establishment, which took the statement as a sign even the judges understood they were standing on a weak legal foundation. But the justices may get their way. Most experts still consider Bush v. Gore bad law. Rejecting the Affordable Care Act could deprive 30 million people of health insurance, weaken the coverage for tens of millions more, and alter one-sixth of the economy. In those respects, obviously, it would be a highly consequential decision. But such a ruling could also have have far-reaching legal effects, the kind Bush v. Gore did not. At least in theory, the court could use this case to redefine the boundaries of federal power, in a way that the courts have not done in nearly a century. I generally leave the sophisticated constitutional analysis to Jeff Rosen, my (much) more informed colleague. But you don't have to be a legal expert to spot three key questions before the Court, each of which could lead the justices to establish new constitutional doctrine: What are the limits of the federal government's power to regulate interstate commerce? Defenders of the law claim that the individual mandate, which requires most non-poor people to obtain insurance or pay a penalty, falls within its power to regulate commerce among the states. A long line of precedents suggests the defenders of the law are right. Ever since the New Deal, the Court has held that federal power here is very broad. If it's a legitimately federal matter, as the health care economy certainly seems to be, then the government has virtually unlimited authority to regulate it. A majority of the justices may disagree. But, if so, they'll need to break new ground \u2014 that is, they'll have to establish a limit on the commerce power that does not now exist. For example, critics of the law suggest that the commerce power does not extend to regulating \"inactivity,\" which is their term for declining to obtain insurance for future medical expenses. A majority of justices could decide to adopt that reasoning. But, if they do, the justices will be drawing a distinction that the court has never recognized before. Judge Laurence Silberman, the highly respected conservative who sits on the D.C. Circuit, made this point in his opinion upholding the law: Silberman went on to note that the \"right to be free from federal regulation is not absolute, and yields to the imperative that Congress be free to forge national solutions to national problems, no matter how local--or seemingly passive--their individual origins.\" Do five justices of the Supreme Court disagree? And, if so, are they suggesting the constitution doesn't authorize national solutions to what are clearly national problems? It's possible, as Jeffrey Toobin warns in the New Yorker: What are the limits of the \"necessary and proper\" clause? The commerce clause isn't the only place in the constitution the government claims to find authority for the mandate. It also cites the \"necessary and proper\" clause. Specifically, the government claims that the mandate is \"necessary\" for carrying out its plan to regulate the price of health insurance (a goal even the law's critics recognize is, by itself, legitimate) and a \"proper\" means for doing so. Here, too, the government has the power of precedent on its side. Chief Justice John Marshall famously established this idea in McCullough v. Maryland, which is to federal power what flour is to cake. Through the years, the court has largely stood by this broad interpretation, most recently in 2010 in Comstock v. United States. In that case, Chief Justice John Roberts was part of a five-member majority that ruled the federal government could take action \"rationally related\" and \"reasonably adapted\" to one of its explicit constitutional duties. The individual mandate would seem to meet those two criteria rather easily. Insurance mandates are certainly common for more voluntary activities, like driving a car or living in a flood plain. And, by enacting the mandate, Congress was following the advice of non-partisan experts, including those at the Congressional Budget Office, who said that a mandate was essential to maximizing insurance coverage and reducing the price of insurance through a system of private health benefits. Again, the Supreme Court could disagree. The justices can say whatever they want to say. But to do so honestly they'd need to revisit Comstock and, at least implicitly, McCollough. And Justice Antonin Scalia, in particular, would have to find some way to explain away his concurring opinion in Gonzales v. Raich, in which he stated \"Congress may regulate even noneconomic local activity if that regulation is a necessary part of a more general regulation of interstate commerce\" and when a failure to take such action might \"undercut\" legitimate regulations. This is precisely the argument that the administration and its allies make about the mandate: That, without it, regulations of the insurance industry won't work as well. Without a broad reading of the necessary and proper clause, lawyers for libertarians can start asking other questions  \u2014 and, potentially, undermining other federal programs most of us take for granted. \"If you accept [this] logic,\" Northwestern law professor Andrew Koppelman wrote recently, \"then it is not clear how, say, the Environmental Protection Agency could survive, since there is no enumerated power to keep the country's air breathable or its water drinkable.\" Ironically, some conservatives might also come to rue such a decision. After all, if it's unconstitutional to compel contributions towards private health insurance, then surely it's unconstitutional to compel contributions toward private investment accounts \u2014 which happens to be the idea many conservatives still have for replacing Social Security. As Simon Lazarus, counsel for the National Senior Citizens Law Center, noted last year in Slate, two of the conservative appellate judges who rejected these lawsuits cited that very possibility in their rulings. Is Medicaid coercive to the states? This is the sleeper issue of the case. Medicaid is the joint federal-state insurance program for low-income people. The states run the program, but they do so under guidelines set by the federal government, which provides a large portion of the funding. The Affordable Care Act expands Medicaid eligibility guidelines significantly, so that, starting in 2014, anybody with income below 133 percent of the poverty line can receive it. The result will be approximately 15 million more people with Medicaid coverage, according to projections from the CBO. The federal government is picking up the vast majority of this cost, at least for the first few years, but states would have to provide the rest and many don't want to do so. In theory, the states have a choice: They can always drop out of Medicaid altogether, since no law compels them to participate. But, in the lawsuit, states are saying the government is actually coercing them \u2014 in effect, making the states an offer they can't refuse. As their argument goes, states have become so dependent on Medicaid funding for their low-income populations that the prospect of giving up that money is unthinkable, giving the federal government a nearly free hand to shape the program. Again, precedent is on the federal government's side here: Past court decisions have established that federal funding is basically a \"gift\" to the states, one for which the federal government is free to set the terms. The justices could use this case to change that understanding, but if they do they'll be establishing a principle that could undermine a lot of existing programs. Samuel Bagnestos, a professor at the University of Michigan, wrote an amicus brief on behalf consumer advocates including the Children's Defense Fund and American Association of People With Disabilities. Via e-mail, he summarized the import of a ruling that the Medicaid is unconstitutional: Of course, it's possible the court will duck these big questions altogether. It could still decide to rule that the lawsuit is premature, because the law has not taken effect yet. It could decide that the individual mandate is a legitimate exercise of congressional authority to levy taxes \u2014 an argument I have always supported but even some more liberal judges have eyed skeptically \u2014 and leave it at that. Or it could issue a broad ruling accepting the government's case that the law falls clearly within established precedents, just as Silberman and another conservative appellate judge, Jeffrey Sutton, have. If that happens, historians will probably come to see these cases much as the legal establishment did until very recently: As a weak bid by conservatives to overturn legally what they could not block politically. But there's no way to know until the justices make their decision. Update: I'll be writing about the case extensively in this space over the next two weeks. But my overall argument hasn't changed since last January, when I wrote a lengthy article on the legal issues in play. Also, I originally wrote that nobody cites Bush v. Gore, but an alert reader (via twitter) has informed me otherwise. I changed that reference. Finally, I added a quote from Toobin's piece in the New Yorker. The whole thing is worth reading.",

In Rez Life: An Indian's Journey Through Reservation Life, Ojibwe writer  David Treuer strives to capture stories about the beauty of life on reservations. \"We have such fierce attachments to these places,\" he tells NPR's Neal  Conan. \"That's what the book is about to some degree \u2014 the depth of  affection and feeling we have for these places and to have a homeland.\" The son of an Ojibwe mother and an Austrian Holocaust survivor, Treuer grew up on the Leech Lake Reservation in Minnesota. Though he acknowledges that reservation life is challenging, he says most treatments of Native American history don't report the good parts of the experience. \"There's this great disconnect between ... how we feel and  how we seem,\" says Treuer. Treuer, who has written several novels about Native American life, talks about the discoveries in his first work of nonfiction. On the significance of reservations \"It's good to remember, you know, that reservations are ... remnants of our homelands that have been reserved for our use and for  us to live on. So these weren't given to us: These are the miniaturized  portions of land that has always been ours.

NPR reporters analyze the president's 2013 budget proposal: Overview As NPR's Scott Horsley reported Monday morning, President Obama's 2013 budget calls for hundreds of billions of dollars in new federal spending aimed at spurring economic growth. Many of the  proposals are recycled from the American Jobs Act that Obama put forward  in September. Most of those plans have languished in a divided Congress, and the president's budget is likely to do the same. NPR's Scott Neuman reports that the spending plan \"aims to trim $4 trillion from the deficit over the next decade, while boosting   spending to programs to stimulate the still-ailing U.S. economy.\" \"At a time when our economy is growing and creating jobs at a faster pace, our job is to keep things on track,\" Obama told an  audience at a Northern Virginia community college. \"I am proposing some difficult cuts that, frankly, I wouldn't be proposing if I didn't have to.\" Horsley notes that the plan calls for $140 billion in research and development spending, including $2.2 billion for advanced  manufacturing. Obama also wants to invest $476 billion over six years in  transportation infrastructure, financed in part with money that will no  longer be needed in Iraq and Afghanistan. The  president's budget renews his call for higher taxes on the wealthy, Horsley reports.   That includes an end to Bush-era tax cuts for families earning more than $250,000 a year, limited tax deductions for high earners, and the  so-called \"Buffett Rule,\" which would ensure that millionaires pay a minimum tax rate of 30 percent. All told, Horsley says, the budget proposes $1.5 trillion in new tax revenue over the coming  decade. That includes a new $61 billion tax on big banks and $41 billion in additional taxes on fossil fuel producers. Pentagon The Pentagon is proposing a 6 percent overall spending decrease in its 2013 budget. Those cuts will rely heavily on a big drop in troop strength, according to the proposed budget released by the White House on Monday. By 2017, the Army will lose  72,000 soldiers, the Marines will lose 20,000, and there will be 6,200 fewer sailors  and 4,200 fewer airmen. Plans to hand the  biggest reductions to the Army and Marines are in line with the Pentagon's plans to create a more mobile force, with less focus on major conflicts as the two  major wars the U.S. has been fighting end. The Army and Marine Corps still will be  larger than they were in 2001. At the same time, the Pentagon is ramping up funding for its newest priorities: becoming  more active in the Pacific and the Middle  East. To that end, the military will maintain the current bomber fleet, and the carrier fleet of 11 ships. Army and Marine Corps forces in these two regions will also remain strong. The Pentagon  says it will protect funding for upgrades to the Global Positioning System  (GPS) and other space-based systems that enhance surveillance and communications. But the military will be  phasing out a defense weather satellite system and a successor to the U.S. spy  plane known as Global Hawk Block 30, which were deemed too expensive. The Pentagon  was at pains to point out that service members will not take the brunt of  these cuts. The budget is only calling  for increases in things such as pharmacy copays and health care enrollment fees  for some retirees. Though pay raises will slow in the future, the budget for 2013 calls for a 1.4 percent increase. The Pentagon says personnel costs make up one-third of the military budget, but cuts in benefits will only contribute about 10 percent of the savings for 2013. -- Larry Abramson Foreign Affairs Updated  at 3:15 p.m.: The Obama administration is  proposing $51.6 billion for the State Department and the U.S. Agency for  International Development. While advocates are pleased to see this commitment to  diplomacy and development, they worry about cuts in global health, and  humanitarian and refugee assistance. A big part of the budget is for the Overseas Contingency Operations in Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan, though the $8.2 billion request is less than last year, and the State Department recently announced that it will be scaling back its huge diplomatic mission in Iraq by cutting costs associated with contractors. In Iraq, the Obama administration is  requesting $4.8 billion for next year, which is about 10 percent less  than last year. The administration is requesting another $1.3 billion for Egypt. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland  says security assistance has been a good investment over the years, though she has  been warning that it will be hard to disburse all of this year's aid unless  Egypt ends a crackdown on  U.S. democracy-promotion  groups. The new budget includes $770 million for a new Middle East and North Africa Incentive Fund to support economic reforms in the wake of popular  uprisings. \"The Middle East is reinventing itself before our eyes,\" says  Deputy Secretary of State Thomas Nides. \"The demands on us have never been  higher.  And you will see all of that in this budget  request.\" --  Michele  Kelemen Education President Obama's 2013  education budget totals $69.8 billion in discretionary spending. The bulk  of that money is for Pell Grants for needy college students, K-12 school  reforms, Title I funding for disadvantaged students, special education and early  childhood education. Two new education  initiatives are unprecedented in funding and scope: The biggest is an $8  billion fund to train 2 million workers in health care, transportation,  information technology and advanced manufacturing. In a new partnership with  businesses, community colleges will expand career centers, designed to meet  employers' needs in high-skilled, high-growth industries. The three-year fund  will also support small-business entrepreneurs and paid internships for  low-income community college students. The other new  initiative is an $80 million competitive grants program to train 100,000 new  teachers. The money would go to four-year colleges to provide innovative teacher  training programs in science, technology, engineering and math. These are areas  in which the United  States faces significant teacher  shortages. Funding for community  colleges, teachers and career academies is a one-time, mandatory  request. -- Claudio Sanchez Aid For The Poor The president proposes cuts in a few programs for the poor that he has targeted before, arguing that the budget-reduction  pain needs to be shared. Among the largest proposed cuts is $452 million in the  Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), which helps low-income families pay their heating bills. The budget notes that the $3 billion  requested for LIHEAP is higher than the amount the president requested last year  because of rising energy costs. But the program has bipartisan backing, especially in New England states. And a large group of lawmakers is pushing to get LIHEAP spending back to the level it was a couple of years ago, close to $5 billion. The president has also called for a $329 million cut in the $1.7 billion Community Services Block Grant program,  which helps fund local programs intended to alleviate poverty. These might  include things such as job training and tax preparation services. The budget would also make minor trims in Job Corps and in a program to provide affordable housing for low-income individuals with disabilities. The administration argues that some of these trims are part of an effort to make programs more efficient  and accountable. The budget calls for $3 billion in  Community Development Block Grants, the same level that Congress enacted this  year. However, the program, which helps local governments pay for affordable  housing and other development projects, has been cut substantially in recent  years. Funding for homeless assistance programs would go up about $300 million  under the president's budget. The budget would provide more than  $7 billion in food assistance for low-income women, infants and children, and  anticipates spending more than $100 billion next year on other food and  nutrition programs, including food stamps \u2014 also known as SNAP  benefits. Programs to help low- and  moderate-income Americans appear to have escaped serious cuts, in part because  they've been cut so much already. There are many on Capitol Hill who think there's still a lot of spending waste \u2014 more tightening is likely as lawmakers  try to further reduce the size of government. But anti-poverty groups will  continue making the argument that now is not the time to weaken safety net programs relied upon by many Americans, and they've had some success in recent  budget fights. -- Pam Fessler Homeland Security Added at 3:15 p.m.: President Obama's budget would make a small trim in Homeland Security spending. The president proposes $39.5 billion for the agency, a decrease of 0.5 percent or $191 million less than what was enacted last year. Most of the savings come from cuts in administrative costs, including overtime and travel. The budget would increase spending on border security and cybersecurity.  There's also money for new explosives detection systems at U.S. airports. The Coast Guard would get funds for a new cutter and ice breaker to replace aging vessels \"well past their service life.\" More than $6 billion would be set aside for FEMA's disaster relief fund, which covers the anticipated costs of natural disasters like hurricanes and tornadoes.  Other FEMA grants would be eliminated. The administration also says it will take measures to speed spending of some $9 billion in FEMA grant money already in the pipeline to \"grow the economy now.\" The budget also continues current administration policy of focusing immigration enforcement efforts on identifying and removing illegal immigrants who are criminals.  For those judged low risk, the administration says it is enhancing the \"Alternatives to Detention\" program \u2014 such as electronic monitoring \u2014 which costs significantly less than detention. -- Brian Naylor Space Added at 3:15 p.m.: Scientists who use NASA spacecraft to study Mars were expecting bad news from NASA's 2013 budget, and they got it. With the exception of the Mars Science Laboratory, which is already on its way to Mars, and a mission to sample the Martian atmosphere scheduled for launch next year, NASA is re-evaluating its long-term Mars strategy. In practical terms, that means pulling out of two missions planned in cooperation with the European Space Agency for later this decade. The news wasn't all bad for space science. NASA's proposed budget for 2013 is $17.7 billion, essentially flat compared with 2012. But that will still allow spending $628 million on the James Webb Space Telescope to keep it on track for launch in 2018. There's also $1.8 billion for research and new spacecraft for studying Earth. The space agency will continue to send astronauts and supplies to the International Space Station at a cost of $3 billion. The budget proposal also contains $2.9 billion for a new deep-space crew capsule and a heavy-lift rocket for future human exploration missions. -- Joe Palca Transportation Added at 4:35  p.m.: President Obama's proposed transportation budget  continues the administration's emphasis on rebuilding the nation's  infrastructure both as an end in itself and as a way to promote job growth.  The  president proposes $74 billion in transportation spending, an increase of 2  percent from current levels \u2014 although considerably less than the president  requested a year earlier.  Within the overall budget is a $476 billion, six-year  surface transportation plan, which the administration says will \"pave the way  for long-term economic growth.\" The spending would be paid for with  part of what the administration calls the \"peace dividend,\" half the funds saved  from ramping down the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.  (The other half would be used to reduce the  national debt.) In a conference call with reporters,  Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood said the proposal allows for \"nation-building right here at home.\" The spending plan includes a $50  billion infusion this year that \"jump-starts job creation\" by funding  improvements in roads, bridges, transit systems, border crossings, railways and  runways. It also includes continued spending  on high-speed railroads, improved pipeline safety, and $1 billion for \"NextGen\" modernization of the nation's air traffic control  system. The House and Senate are each  expected to begin floor debate this week on their own transportation bills, both  of which include significantly less funding than the administration  proposes. -- Brian  Naylor Energy And The  Environment Added at 4:35  p.m.: The president's budget request  reflects his continued emphasis  on renewable and clean energy  sources. He requested a 3 percent uptick for the Energy Department to $27  billion. That includes an increase of $527 million for programs to improve  energy efficiency and promote the adoption of renewable power, such as a program  that develops energy-saving strategies for manufacturing companies and another  designed to make roof-top solar  cost-competitive. \"We're very  focused on saving money by saving energy,\" says Energy Secretary Steven  Chu. Obama has  recently been calling for an \"all-of-the-above\" domestic energy push, but his  budget repeats a proposal to cut $4 billion in subsidies for oil, gas and other  fossil fuels, which Congress has yet to  approve. Industry groups  and Republicans in Congress attacked this and other proposals in the budget that  would charge new fees to the oil and gas industry on federal  land.  The budget does  highlight some additional funding for natural gas and oil production \u2014 about $50  million that would fund joint research by several agencies  to understand and reduce the  environmental, health and safety risks of producing natural gas and oil through  an engineering practice known as hydraulic fracturing, or fracking. Companies  inject huge quantities of water and chemicals to blast cracks into rock  formations so the gas or oil can flow out. \"We will begin to  assess potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on air quality, water quality  and ecosystems,\" EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson  says. Unconventional oil and  gas developments are changing the face of domestic energy production. Already  more than 60 percent of natural gas production comes from unconventional  sources, according to Chu. The Environmental  Protection Agency was asked to take another cut in its budget, but just a small  one. The president requests a 1 percent decrease in funds for the EPA. That  would be the third year in a row that the agency was reduced. Jackson says there's enough  in the budget to implement programs that cut greenhouse gas emissions and  gasoline use by cars and reduce air pollution. By shifting money around, the  agency is increasing funding to help companies comply with the pollution laws  and more accurately report how much they are polluting, and the impact of that  pollution on air quality near the industries. The Interior  Department's budget request was essentially flat, with a 1 percent increase. The  president did propose additional funds for the new agencies that regulate and  manage offshore oil production. -- Elizabeth  Shogren Taxes And Social Security Added at 4:35  p.m.: The  2013 budget notes the Social Security program is projected to exhaust its trust  fund by 2036. The Obama administration also assumes Congress will approve a  yearlong reduction by 2 percentage points in the Social Security payroll tax  withholding for employees. The president's spending blueprint nonetheless spares  this old-age and disability social insurance program from any cuts. Indeed,  outlays for Social Security are projected to increase by more than $65 billion  for the 2013 fiscal year, totaling nearly $883  billion. Most taxpayers will not see their  federal tax rates go up under the 2013 budget.  But for the approximately 3  million taxpayers with annual household income above $250,000, income exceeding  that amount will be subject to higher taxes. Obama proposes allowing the  scheduled expiration at the end of 2012 of the Bush-era tax cuts for the top two  brackets. Estate tax exemptions and rates would also return to 2009 levels. This  would produce an extra $968 billion in revenue over the next decade. In  addition, such wealthy households will only be able to claim itemized deductions  for income up to the third-highest tax bracket of 28 percent. That limitation  would add another $584 billion to Treasury's coffers over the next 10 years. The FY2013 budget also proposes what  Obama has called the Buffett Rule: namely, that those making more than $1  million a year pay no less than 30 percent of their income in taxes. The Buffett  Rule would replace the Alternative Minimum Tax, which has required a fix every  year to keep it from affecting middle-income earners. And a loophole would be eliminated  that allows hedge fund managers  to claim profits as \"carried interest,\" for which they've been taxed at the 15  percent capital gains tax rate rather than the generally much higher ordinary  income tax rates. Capital gains tax rates would increase from 15 percent to 20  percent with the expiration at year's end of those particular Bush-era tax  cuts. -- David Welna Health Care Added at 4:35  p.m.: It's hard to imagine a budget whose total is nearing $1 trillion annually being called austere, but that's the case with this year's funding for the Department of Health and Human Services. Most programs or agencies, including normally high-priority agencies like the National Institutes of Health, are set to see their funding frozen or cut slightly for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is only averting a large budget cut because the administration is diverting almost $1 billion from a public health prevention fund created by the 2010 health overhaul. The bulk of the department's funding \u2014 and most of the proposed savings \u2014 are aimed at the huge twin health entitlement programs: Medicare for the elderly and disabled, and Medicaid for the poor. And if the proposals to trim an estimated $364 billion from those two programs sound familiar, that's because they are. With few exceptions, the health care cost savers \u2014 which include boosting some required payments for Medicare beneficiaries and lowering what the programs pay for prescription drugs \u2014 were originally offered last fall. That's when the so-called congressional supercommittee was trying to come up with ways to reduce the deficit. Congress didn't pay much attention to Obama's health proposals last year and probably won't this year, either. But with Medicare likely to be a major issue in this year's election, look for Republicans to use the budget proposals aimed at Medicare patients to blunt Democratic attacks based on the GOP budget plan passed in 2011. Both sides will try to convince seniors that the other side will try to make them pay more for their Medicare. -- Julie Rovner",

The text of President Obama's State of the Union address, as delivered: Thank you. Thank you so much. Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, members of Congress, distinguished guests, and fellow Americans: Last month, I went to Andrews Air Force Base and welcomed home some of our last troops to serve in Iraq. Together, we offered a final, proud salute to the colors under which more than a million of our fellow citizens fought \u2014 and several thousand gave their lives. Tweets NPR's Ron Elving: \"It took 103 words for President Obama to mention the demise of Osama bin Laden. Surely a new record.\" We gather tonight knowing that this generation of heroes has made the United States safer and more respected around the world. For the first time in nine years, there are no Americans fighting in Iraq. For the first time in two decades, Osama bin Laden is not a threat to this country. Most of al Qaeda's top lieutenants have been defeated. The Taliban's momentum has been broken, and some troops in Afghanistan have begun to come home. These achievements are a testament to the courage, selflessness, and teamwork of America's Armed Forces. At a time when too many of our institutions have let us down, they exceed all expectations. They're not consumed with personal ambition. They don't obsess over their differences. They focus on the mission at hand. They work together. Imagine what we could accomplish if we followed their example. Think about the America within our reach: A country that leads the world in educating its people. An America that attracts a new generation of high-tech manufacturing and high-paying jobs. A future where we're in control of our own energy, and our security and prosperity aren't so tied to unstable parts of the world. An economy built to last, where hard work pays off, and responsibility is rewarded. We can do this. I know we can, because we've done it before. At the end of World War II, when another generation of heroes returned home from combat, they built the strongest economy and middle class the world has ever known. My grandfather, a veteran of Patton's Army, got the chance to go to college on the GI Bill. My grandmother, who worked on a bomber assembly line, was part of a workforce that turned out the best products on Earth. The two of them shared the optimism of a Nation that had triumphed over a depression and fascism. They understood they were part of something larger; that they were contributing to a story of success that every American had a chance to share \u2014 the basic American promise that if you worked hard, you could do well enough to raise a family, own a home, send your kids to college, and put a little away for retirement. The defining issue of our time is how to keep that promise alive. No challenge is more urgent. No debate is more important. We can either settle for a country where a shrinking number of people do really well, while a growing number of Americans barely get by. Or we can restore an economy where everyone gets a fair shot, and everyone does their fair share, and everyone plays by the same set of rules. What's at stake aren't Democratic values or Republican values, but American values. We have to reclaim them. Let's remember how we got here. Long before the recession, jobs and manufacturing began leaving our shores. Technology made businesses more efficient, but also made some jobs obsolete. Folks at the top saw their incomes rise like never before, but most hardworking Americans struggled with costs that were growing, paychecks that weren't, and personal debt that kept piling up. In 2008, the house of cards collapsed. We learned that mortgages had been sold to people who couldn't afford or understand them. Banks had made huge bets and bonuses with other people's money. Regulators had looked the other way, or didn't have the authority to stop the bad behavior. It was wrong. It was irresponsible. And it plunged our economy into a crisis that put millions out of work, saddled us with more debt, and left innocent, hard-working Americans holding the bag. In the six months before I took office, we lost nearly four million jobs. And we lost another four million before our policies were in full effect. In the GOP response, Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels said: \"He cannot claim that the last three  years have made things anything but worse: the percentage of Americans with a  job is at the lowest in decades.\" More \u00bb Those are the facts. But so are these. In the last 22 months, businesses have created more than three million jobs. Last year, they created the most jobs since 2005. American manufacturers are hiring again, creating jobs for the first time since the late 1990s. Together, we've agreed to cut the deficit by more than $2 trillion. And we've put in place new rules to hold Wall Street accountable, so a crisis like this never happens again. The state of our Union is getting stronger. And we've come too far to turn back now. As long as I'm President, I will work with anyone in this chamber to build on this momentum. But I intend to fight obstruction with action, and I will oppose any effort to return to the very same policies that brought on this economic crisis in the first place. No, we will not go back to an economy weakened by outsourcing, bad debt, and phony financial profits. Tonight, I want to speak about how we move forward, and lay out a blueprint for an economy that's built to last \u2014 an economy built on American manufacturing, American energy, skills for American workers, and a renewal of American values. This blueprint begins with American manufacturing. On the day I took office, our auto industry was on the verge of collapse. Some even said we should let it die. With a million jobs at stake, I refused to let that happen. In exchange for help, we demanded responsibility. We got workers and automakers to settle their differences. We got the industry to retool and restructure. Today, General Motors is back on top as the world's number one automaker. Chrysler has grown faster in the U.S. than any major car company. Ford is investing billions in U.S. plants and factories. And together, the entire industry added nearly 160,000 jobs. We bet on American workers. We bet on American ingenuity. And tonight, the American auto industry is back. Writes NPR's Mark Memmott: \"In mentioning where his policies can create jobs, the president cites cities in three 'swing states.' \" What's happening in Detroit can happen in other industries. It can happen in Cleveland and Pittsburgh and Raleigh. We can't bring every job back that's left our shores. But right now, it's getting more expensive to do business in places like China. Meanwhile, America is more productive. A few weeks ago, the CEO of Master Lock told me that it now makes business sense for him to bring jobs back home. Today, for the first time in fifteen years, Master Lock's unionized plant in Milwaukee is running at full capacity. So we have a huge opportunity, at this moment, to bring manufacturing back. But we have to seize it. Tonight, my message to business leaders is simple: Ask yourselves what you can do to bring jobs back to your country, and your country will do everything we can to help you succeed. We should start with our tax code. Right now, companies get tax breaks for moving jobs and profits overseas. Meanwhile, companies that choose to stay in America get hit with one of the highest tax rates in the world. It makes no sense, and everyone knows it. So let's change it. First, if you're a business that wants to outsource jobs, you shouldn't get a tax deduction for doing it. That money should be used to cover moving expenses for companies like Master Lock that decide to bring jobs home. Second, no American company should be able to avoid paying its fair share of taxes by moving jobs and profits overseas. From now on, every multinational company should have to pay a basic minimum tax. And every penny should go towards lowering taxes for companies that choose to stay here and hire here \u2014 in America. Third, if you're an American manufacturer, you should get a bigger tax cut. If you're a high-tech manufacturer, we should double the tax deduction you get for making your products here. And if you want to relocate in a community that was hit hard when a factory left town, you should get help financing a new plant, equipment, or training for new workers. So, my message, my message is simple. It's time to stop rewarding businesses that ship jobs overseas, and start rewarding companies that create jobs right here in America. Send me these tax reforms, and I will sign them right away. We're also making it easier for American businesses to sell products all over the world. Two years ago, I set a goal of doubling U.S. exports over five years. With the bipartisan trade agreements we signed into law, we are on track to meet that goal \u2014 ahead of schedule. Soon, there will be millions of new customers for American goods in Panama, Colombia, and South Korea. Soon, there will be new cars on the streets of Seoul imported from Detroit, and Toledo, and Chicago. Now, I will go anywhere in the world to open new markets for American products. And I will not stand by when our competitors don't play by the rules. We've brought trade cases against China at nearly twice the rate as the last administration \u2014 and it's made a difference. Over a thousand Americans are working today because we stopped a surge in Chinese tires. But we need to do more. It's not right when another country lets our movies, music, and software be pirated. It's not fair when foreign manufacturers have a leg up on ours only because they're heavily subsidized. Tonight, I'm announcing the creation of a Trade Enforcement Unit that will be charged with investigating unfair trading practices in countries like China. There will be more inspections, more inspections to prevent counterfeit or unsafe goods from crossing our borders. And this Congress should make sure that no foreign company has an advantage over American manufacturing when it comes to accessing financing or new markets like Russia. Our workers are the most productive on Earth, and if the playing field is level, I promise you \u2014 America will always win. I also hear from many business leaders who want to hire in the United States but can't find workers with the right skills. Growing industries in science and technology have twice as many openings as we have workers who can do the job. Think about that \u2014 openings at a time when millions of Americans are looking for work. It's inexcusable. And we know how to fix it. Jackie Bray is a single mom from North Carolina who was laid off from her job as a mechanic. Then Siemens opened a gas turbine factory in Charlotte, and formed a partnership with Central Piedmont Community College. The company helped the college design courses in laser and robotics training. It paid Jackie's tuition, then hired her to help operate their plant. President Obama called for a \"new national commitment\" to train 2  million Americans with skills that will lead directly to a job.  He  singled out partnerships between businesses and community colleges.  It  was not the first time he's proposed this, though.  Earlier in his  administration he abandoned a $12 billion plan to help community  colleges expand their training programs.  It's not clear where the money  for this \"new\" national commitment will come from. More \u00bb -- Claudio Sanchez I want every American looking for work to have the same opportunity as Jackie did. Join me in a national commitment to train two million Americans with skills that will lead directly to a job.  My Administration has already lined up more companies that want to help. Model partnerships between businesses like Siemens and community colleges in places like Charlotte, Orlando, and Louisville are up and running. Now you need to give more community colleges the resources they need to become community career centers \u2014 places that teach people skills local businesses are looking for right now, from data management to high-tech manufacturing. And I want to cut through the maze of confusing training programs, so that from now on, people like Jackie have one program, one website, and one place to go for all the information and help they need. It is time to turn our unemployment system into a reemployment system that puts people to work. These reforms will help people get jobs that are open today. But to prepare for the jobs of tomorrow, our commitment to skills and education has to start earlier. For less than one percent of what our Nation spends on education each year, we've convinced nearly every State in the country to raise their standards for teaching and learning \u2014 the first time that's happened in a generation. But challenges remain. And we know how to solve them. At a time when other countries are doubling down on education, tight budgets have forced States to lay off thousands of teachers. We know a good teacher can increase the lifetime income of a classroom by over $250,000. A great teacher can offer an escape from poverty to the child who dreams beyond his circumstance. Every person in this chamber can point to a teacher who changed the trajectory of their lives. Most teachers work tirelessly, with modest pay, sometimes digging into their own pocket for school supplies \u2014 just to make a difference. Teachers matter. So instead of bashing them, or defending the status quo, let's offer schools a deal. Give them the resources to keep good teachers on the job, and reward the best ones. And in return, grant schools flexibility: To teach with creativity and passion; to stop teaching to the test; and to replace teachers who just aren't helping kids learn. That's a bargain worth making. We also know that when students don't walk away from their education, more of them walk the stage to get their diploma. When students are not allowed to drop out, they do better. So tonight, I call on every State to require that all students stay in high school until they graduate or turn eighteen. When kids do graduate, the most daunting challenge can be the cost of college. At a time when Americans owe more in tuition debt than credit card debt, this Congress needs to stop the interest rates on student loans from doubling in July. Extend the tuition tax credit we started that saves millions of middle-class families thousands of dollars. And give more young people the chance to earn their way through college by doubling the number of work-study jobs in the next five years. Of course, it's not enough for us to increase student aid. We can't just keep subsidizing skyrocketing tuition; we'll run out of money. States also need to do their part, by making higher education a higher priority in their budgets. And colleges and universities have to do their part by working to keep costs down. Now, Recently, I spoke with a group of college presidents who've done just that. Some schools re-design courses to help students finish more quickly. Some use better technology. The point is, it's possible. So let me put colleges and universities on notice: If you can't stop tuition from going up, the funding you get from taxpayers will go down. Higher education can't be a luxury \u2014 it is an economic imperative that every family in America should be able to afford. Let's also remember that hundreds of thousands of talented, hardworking students in this country face another challenge: The fact that they aren't yet American citizens. Many were brought here as small children, are American through and through, yet they live every day with the threat of deportation. Others came more recently, to study business and science and engineering, but as soon as they get their degree, we send them home to invent new products and create new jobs somewhere else. That doesn't make sense. I believe as strongly as ever that we should take on illegal immigration. That's why my Administration has put more boots on the border than ever before. That's why there are fewer illegal crossings than when I took office. The opponents of action are out of excuses. We should be working on comprehensive immigration reform right now. But if election-year politics keeps Congress from acting on a comprehensive plan, let's at least agree to stop expelling responsible young people who want to staff our labs, start new businesses, and defend this country. Send me a law that gives them the chance to earn their citizenship. I will sign it right away. You see, an economy built to last is one where we encourage the talent and ingenuity of every person in this country. That means women should earn equal pay for equal work. It means we should support everyone who's willing to work; and every risk-taker and entrepreneur who aspires to become the next Steve Jobs. After all, innovation is what America has always been about. Most new jobs are created in start-ups and small businesses. So let's pass an agenda that helps them succeed. Tear down regulations that prevent aspiring entrepreneurs from getting the financing to grow. Expand tax relief to small businesses that are raising wages and creating good jobs. Both parties agree on these ideas. So put them in a bill, and get it on my desk this year. Innovation also demands basic research. Today, the discoveries taking place in our federally-financed labs and universities could lead to new treatments that kill cancer cells but leave healthy ones untouched. New lightweight vests for cops and soldiers that can stop any bullet. Don't gut these investments in our budget. Don't let other countries win the race for the future. Support the same kind of research and innovation that led to the computer chip and the Internet; to new American jobs and new American industries. Nowhere is the promise of innovation greater than in American-made energy. Over the last three years, we've opened millions of new acres for oil and gas exploration, and tonight, I'm directing my Administration to open more than 75 percent of our potential offshore oil and gas resources. Right now, right now American oil production is the highest that it's been in eight years. That's right \u2014 eight years. Not only that \u2014 last year, we relied less on foreign oil than in any of the past sixteen years. But with only 2 percent of the world's oil reserves, oil isn't enough. This country needs an all-out, all-of-the-above strategy that develops every available source of American energy \u2013 a strategy that's cleaner, cheaper, and full of new jobs. But some Republicans and energy  industry officials say that Obama is taking credit for successes that were not  of his own making, since his administration has been comparatively stingy about  allowing new permits for drilling on public lands and  offshore. More \u00bb -- Alan Greenblatt We have a supply of natural gas that can last America nearly one hundred years, and my Administration will take every possible action to safely develop this energy. Experts believe this will support more than 600,000 jobs by the end of the decade. And I'm requiring all companies that drill for gas on public lands to disclose the chemicals they use. America will develop this resource without putting the health and safety of our citizens at risk. The development of natural gas will create jobs and power trucks and factories that are cleaner and cheaper, proving that we don't have to choose between our environment and our economy. And by the way, it was public research dollars, over the course of thirty years, that helped develop the technologies to extract all this natural gas out of shale rock \u2014 reminding us that Government support is critical in helping businesses get new energy ideas off the ground. Now, what's true for natural gas is just as true for clean energy. In three years, our partnership with the private sector has already positioned America to be the world's leading manufacturer of high-tech batteries. Because of federal investments, renewable energy use has nearly doubled. And thousands of Americans have jobs because of it. When Bryan Ritterby was laid off from his job making furniture, he said he worried that at 55, no one would give him a second chance. But he found work at Energetx, a wind turbine manufacturer in Michigan. Before the recession, the factory only made luxury yachts. Today, it's hiring workers like Bryan, who said, \"I'm proud to be working in the industry of the future.\" Memmott writes: \"In an indirect reference to the controversial, and failed, government investment in Solyndra, the president says 'some technologies don't pan out; some companies fail. But I will not walk away from the promise of clean energy.' \" Our experience with shale gas, our experience with natural gas shows us that the payoffs on these public investments don't always come right away. Some technologies don't pan out; some companies fail. But I will not walk away from the promise of clean energy. I will not walk away from workers like Bryan. I will not cede the wind or solar or battery industry to China or Germany because we refuse to make the same commitment here. We have subsidized oil companies for a century. That's long enough. It's time to end the taxpayer giveaways to an industry that's rarely been more profitable, and double-down on a clean energy industry that's never been more promising. Pass clean energy tax credits and create these jobs. We can also spur energy innovation with new incentives. The differences in this chamber may be too deep right now to pass a comprehensive plan to fight climate change. But there's no reason why Congress shouldn't at least set a clean energy standard that creates a market for innovation. So far, you haven't acted. Well tonight, I will. I'm directing my Administration to allow the development of clean energy on enough public land to power three million homes. And I'm proud to announce that the Department of Defense, working with us, the world's largest consumer of energy, will make one of the largest commitments to clean energy in history \u2014 with the Navy purchasing enough capacity to power a quarter of a million homes a year. Of course, the easiest way to save money is to waste less energy. So here's a proposal: Help manufacturers eliminate energy waste in their factories and give businesses incentives to upgrade their buildings. Their energy bills will be $100 billion lower over the next decade, and America will have less pollution, more manufacturing, more jobs for construction workers who need them. Send me a bill that creates these jobs. Building this new energy future should be just one part of a broader agenda to repair America's infrastructure. So much of America needs to be rebuilt. We've got crumbling roads and bridges. A power grid that wastes too much energy. An incomplete high-speed broadband network that prevents a small business owner in rural America from selling her products all over the world. During the Great Depression, America built the Hoover Dam and the Golden Gate Bridge. After World War II, we connected our States with a system of highways. Democratic and Republican administrations invested in great projects that benefited everybody, from the workers who built them to the businesses that still use them today. To use the money we're no longer spending at war to pay down the debt would mean borrowing that much more money, since the wars in both Iraq and Afghanistan have been deficit-financed. It's like taking half the money you've borrowed to pay for your car and using it to pay down half your car debt. Sounds good ... except that money's tied up in the car. -- David Welna In the next few weeks, I will sign an Executive Order clearing away the red tape that slows down too many construction projects. But you need to fund these projects. Take the money we're no longer spending at war, use half of it to pay down our debt, and use the rest to do some nation-building right here at home. There's never been a better time to build, especially since the construction industry was one of the hardest-hit when the housing bubble burst. Of course, construction workers weren't the only ones who were hurt. So were millions of innocent Americans who've seen their home values decline. And while Government can't fix the problem on its own, responsible homeowners shouldn't have to sit and wait for the housing market to hit bottom to get some relief. It's unlikely that the president will  be able to get such legislation through Congress in an election year. Also,  Obama talked about paying for the program with some form of new fee or tax.  Again, an unlikely prospect in an election  year.  More \u00bb -- Chris Arnold And that's why I'm sending this Congress a plan that gives every responsible homeowner the chance to save about $3,000 a year on their mortgage, by refinancing at historically low interest rates. No more red tape. No more runaround from the banks. A small fee on the largest financial institutions will ensure that it won't add to the deficit, and will give those banks that were rescued by taxpayers a chance to repay a deficit of trust. Let's never forget: Millions of Americans who work hard and play by the rules every day deserve a Government and a financial system that do the same. It's time to apply the same rules from top to bottom: No bailouts, no handouts, and no copouts. An America built to last insists on responsibility from everybody. We've all paid the price for lenders who sold mortgages to people who couldn't afford them, and buyers who knew they couldn't afford them. That's why we need smart regulations to prevent irresponsible behavior. Rules to prevent financial fraud, or toxic dumping, or faulty medical devices, these don't destroy the free market. They make the free market work better. Now, there is no question that some regulations are outdated, unnecessary, or too costly. In fact, I've approved fewer regulations in the first three years of my presidency than my Republican predecessor did in his. I've ordered every federal agency to eliminate rules that don't make sense. We've already announced over 500 reforms, and just a fraction of them will save business and citizens more than $10 billion over the next five years. We got rid of one rule from 40 years ago that could have forced some dairy farmers to spend $10,000 a year proving that they could contain a spill \u2014 because milk was somehow classified as an oil. With a rule like that, I guess it was worth crying over spilled milk. When it came to health, what was most  surprising was how little President Obama had to say in his State of the Union  address. His landmark 2010 health overhaul \u2014 whose fate is currently before the  Supreme Court and whose repeal is the top priority for every GOP presidential  candidate \u2014 got barely a passing mention. More \u00bb -- Julie Rovner I'm confident a farmer can contain a milk spill without a federal agency looking over his shoulder. But I will not back down from making sure an oil company can contain the kind of oil spill we saw in the Gulf two years ago. We will not back down from protecting our kids from mercury pollution, or making sure that our food is safe and our water is clean.  I will not go back to the days when health insurance companies had unchecked power to cancel your policy, deny you coverage, or charge women differently than men. And I will not go back to the days when Wall Street was allowed to play by its own set of rules. The new rules we passed restore what should be any financial system's core purpose: Getting funding to entrepreneurs with the best ideas, and getting loans to responsible families who want to buy a home, or start a business, or send a kid to college. So if you're a big bank or financial institution, you are no longer allowed to make risky bets with your customers' deposits. You're required to write out a \"living will\" that details exactly how you'll pay the bills if you fail \u2014 because the rest of us are not bailing you out ever again. And if you're a mortgage lender or a payday lender or a credit card company, the days of signing people up for products they can't afford with confusing forms and deceptive practices. Those days are over. Today, American consumers finally have a watchdog in Richard Cordray with one job: To look out for them. We'll also establish a Financial Crimes Unit of highly trained investigators to crack down on large-scale fraud and protect people's investments. Some financial firms violate major anti-fraud laws because there's no real penalty for being a repeat offender. That's bad for consumers, and it's bad for the vast majority of bankers and financial service professionals who do the right thing. So pass legislation that makes the penalties for fraud count. The back story here is that consumer groups have been pushing for this move by the president in the face of an expected settlement between the major Wall Street banks and dozens of states' attorneys general. More \u00bb -- Chris Arnold And tonight, I am asking my Attorney General to create a special unit of federal prosecutors and leading state attorneys general to expand our investigations into the abusive lending and packaging of risky mortgages that led to the housing crisis. This new unit will hold accountable those who broke the law, speed assistance to homeowners, and help turn the page on an era of recklessness that hurt so many Americans. A return to the American values of fair play and shared responsibility will help us protect our people and our economy. But it should also guide as we look to pay down our debt and invest in our future. Elving tweets: \"The President's calling on Congress to pass the payroll tax cut for 2012 is greeted by stony silence from the Republican side.\" Right now, our most immediate priority is stopping a tax hike on 160 million working Americans while the recovery is still fragile. People cannot afford losing $40 out of each paycheck this year. There are plenty of ways to get this done. So let's agree right here, right now: No side issues. No drama. Pass the payroll tax cut without delay. Let's get it done. When it comes to the deficit, we've already agreed to more than $2 trillion in cuts and savings. But we need to do more, and that means making choices. Right now, we're poised to spend nearly $1 trillion more on what was supposed to be a temporary tax break for the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans. Right now, because of loopholes and shelters in the tax code, a quarter of all millionaires pay lower tax rates than millions of middle-class households. Right now, Warren Buffett pays a lower tax rate than his secretary. Do we want to keep these tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans? Or do we want to keep our investments in everything else \u2014 like education and medical research; a strong military and care for our veterans? Because if we're serious about paying down our debt, we can't do both. The American people know what the right choice is. So do I. As I told the Speaker this summer, I'm prepared to make more reforms that rein in the long term costs of Medicare and Medicaid, and strengthen Social Security, so long as those programs remain a guarantee of security for seniors. But in return, we need to change our tax code so that people like me, and an awful lot of Members of Congress, pay our fair share of taxes. Tax reform should follow the Buffett rule: If you make more than $1 million a year, you should not pay less than 30 percent in taxes. And my Republican friend Tom Coburn is right: Washington should stop subsidizing millionaires. In fact, if you're earning a million dollars a year, you shouldn't get special tax subsidies or deductions. On the other hand, if you make under $250,000 a year, like 98 percent of American families, your taxes shouldn't go up. You're the ones struggling with rising costs and stagnant wages. You're the ones who need relief. On a day  when much of the news was dominated by the release of personal income tax  returns by Mitt Romney, a former Massachusetts governor who is seeking the GOP  presidential nomination, Obama called again on rich Americans to pay a greater  share of taxes. Among the guests in the first lady's  box was Debbie Bosanek, the secretary of billionaire investor Warren Buffett.  Buffett has often said it's unfair that he pays a lower effective tax rate on  his investments than his secretary, who earns far less in  wages. More \u00bb -- Alan Greenblatt Debbie Bosanek\n                \n                    \n                    Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Now, you can call this class warfare all you want. But asking a billionaire to pay at least as much as his secretary in taxes? Most Americans would call that common sense. We don't begrudge financial success in this country. We admire it. When Americans talk about folks like me paying my fair share of taxes, it's not because they envy the rich. It's because they understand that when I get a tax break I don't need and the country can't afford, it either adds to the deficit, or somebody else has to make up the difference \u2014 like a senior on a fixed income; or a student trying to get through school; or a family trying to make ends meet. That's not right. Americans know that's not right. They know that this generation's success is only possible because past generations felt a responsibility to each other, and to the future of their country, and they know our way of life will only endure if we feel that same sense of shared responsibility. That's how we'll reduce our deficit. That's an America built to last. I recognize that people watching tonight have differing views about taxes, debt; energy and health care. But no matter what party they belong to, I bet most Americans are thinking the same thing right about now: Nothing will get done this year, or next year, or maybe even the year after that, because Washington is broken. Can you blame them for feeling a little cynical? The greatest blow to our confidence in our economy last year didn't come from events beyond our control. It came from a debate in Washington over whether the United States would pay its bills or not. Who benefited from that fiasco? I've talked tonight about the deficit of trust between Main Street and Wall Street. But the divide between this city and the rest of the country is at least as bad \u2014 and it seems to get worse every year. Some of this has to do with the corrosive influence of money in politics. So together, let's take some steps to fix that. Send me a bill that bans insider trading by Members of Congress, I will sign it tomorrow. Let's limit any elected official from owning stocks in industries they impact. Let's make sure people who bundle campaign contributions for Congress can't lobby Congress, and vice versa \u2014 an idea that has bipartisan support, at least outside of Washington. Some of what's broken has to do with the way Congress does its business these days. A simple majority is no longer enough to get anything \u2014 even routine business \u2014 passed through the Senate. Neither party has been blameless in these tactics. Now both parties should put an end to it. For starters, I ask the Senate to pass a simple rule that all judicial and public service nominations receive a simple up or down vote within 90 days. The executive branch also needs to change. Too often, it's inefficient, outdated and remote. That's why I've asked this Congress to grant me the authority to consolidate the federal bureaucracy so that our Government is leaner, quicker, and more responsive to the needs of the American people. Finally, none of this can happen unless we also lower the temperature in this town. We need to end the notion that the two parties must be locked in a perpetual campaign of mutual destruction; that politics is about clinging to rigid ideologies instead of building consensus around common sense ideas. From Elving: \"Finding a lever at last, Obama quotes Lincoln ... Republicans rise, applaud.\" I'm a Democrat. But I believe what Republican Abraham Lincoln believed: That Government should do for people only what they cannot do better by themselves, and no more. That's why my education reform offers more competition, and more control for schools and States. That's why we're getting rid of regulations that don't work. That's why our health care law relies on a reformed private market, not a Government program. On the other hand, even my Republican friends who complain the most about Government spending have supported federally-financed roads, and clean energy projects, and federal offices for the folks back home. The point is, we should all want a smarter, more effective Government. And while we may not be able to bridge our biggest philosophical differences this year, we can make real progress. With or without this Congress, I will keep taking actions that help the economy grow. But I can do a whole lot more with your help. Because when we act together, there is nothing the United States of America can't achieve. That is the lesson we've learned from our actions abroad over the last few years. Ending the Iraq war has allowed us to strike decisive blows against our enemies. From Pakistan to Yemen, the al Qaeda operatives who remain are scrambling, knowing that they can't escape the reach of the United States of America. From this position of strength, we've begun to wind down the war in Afghanistan. Ten thousand of our troops have come home. Twenty-three thousand more will leave by the end of this summer. This transition to Afghan lead will continue, and we will build an enduring partnership with Afghanistan, so that it is never again a source of attacks against America. As the tide of war recedes, a wave of change has washed across the Middle East and North Africa, from Tunis to Cairo; from Sana'a to Tripoli. A year ago, Qadhafi was one of the world's longest-serving dictators \u2014 a murderer with American blood on his hands. Today, he is gone. And in Syria, I have no doubt that the Assad regime will soon discover that the forces of change can't be reversed, and that human dignity cannot be denied. How this incredible transformation will end remains uncertain. But we have a huge stake in the outcome. And while it is ultimately up to the people of the region to decide their fate, we will advocate for those values that have served our own country so well. We will stand against violence and intimidation. We will stand for the rights and dignity of all human beings \u2014 men and women; Christians, Muslims, and Jews. We will support policies that lead to strong and stable democracies and open markets, because tyranny is no match for liberty. And we will safeguard America's own security against those who threaten our citizens, our friends, and our interests. Look at Iran. Through the power of our diplomacy, a world that was once divided about how to deal with Iran's nuclear program now stands as one. The regime is more isolated than ever before; its leaders are faced with crippling sanctions, and as long as they shirk their responsibilities, this pressure will not relent. Let there be no doubt: America is determined to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, and I will take no options off the table to achieve that goal. But a peaceful resolution of this issue is still possible, and far better, and if Iran changes course and meets its obligations, it can rejoin the community of nations. The renewal of American leadership can be felt across the globe. Our oldest alliances in Europe and Asia are stronger than ever. Our ties to the Americas are deeper. Our iron-clad commitment \u2014 and I mean iron-clad \u2014 to Israel's security has meant the closest military cooperation between our two countries in history. We've made it clear that America is a Pacific power, and a new beginning in Burma has lit a new hope. From the coalitions we've built to secure nuclear materials, to the missions we've led against hunger and disease; from the blows we've dealt to our enemies; to the enduring power of our moral example, America is back. Obama seemed a little defensive about Republican charges that U.S. influence has declined under his leadership. Of course, Republicans might say the question is whether America is respected around the world, not whether it's liked. -- Tom Gjelten Anyone who tells you otherwise, anyone who tells you that America is in decline or that our influence has waned, doesn't know what they're talking about. That's not the message we get from leaders around the world, who are eager to work with us. That's not how people feel from Tokyo to Berlin; from Cape Town to Rio; where opinions of America are higher than they've been in years. Yes, the world is changing; no, we can't control every event. But America remains the one indispensable nation in world affairs \u2014 and as long as I'm President, I intend to keep it that way. That's why, working with our military leaders, I have proposed a new defense strategy that ensures we maintain the finest military in the world, while saving nearly half a trillion dollars in our budget. To stay one step ahead of our adversaries, I have already sent this Congress legislation that will secure our country from the growing danger of cyber-threats. Above all, our freedom endures because of the men and women in uniform who defend it. As they come home, we must serve them as well as they've served us. That includes giving them the care and benefits they have earned \u2014 which is why we've increased annual VA spending every year I've been President. And it means enlisting our veterans in the work of rebuilding our Nation. With the bipartisan support of this Congress, we are providing new tax credits to companies that hire vets. Michelle and Jill Biden have worked with American businesses to secure a pledge of 135,000 jobs for veterans and their families. And tonight, I'm proposing a Veterans Jobs Corps that will help our communities hire veterans as cops and firefighters, so that America is as strong as those who defend her. Which brings me back to where I began. Those of us who've been sent here to serve can learn a thing or two from the service of our troops. When you put on that uniform, it doesn't matter if you're black or white; Asian or Latino; Native American; conservative, liberal; rich, poor; gay, straight. When you're marching into battle, you look out for the person next to you, or the mission fails. Or when you're in the thick of the fight, you rise or fall as one unit, serving one Nation, leaving no one behind. One of my proudest possessions is the flag that the SEAL Team took with them on the mission to get bin Laden. On it are each of their names. Some may be Democrats. Some may be Republicans. But that doesn't matter. Just like it didn't matter that day in the Situation Room, when I sat next to Bob Gates \u2014 a man who was George Bush's defense secretary; and Hillary Clinton, a woman who ran against me for president. The  operational commander, Adm. William McRaven, was a special guest in the first  lady's box. More \u00bb -- Tom Gjelten All that mattered that day was the mission. No one thought about politics. No one thought about themselves. One of the young men involved in the raid later told me that he didn't deserve credit for the mission. It only succeeded, he said, because every single member of that unit did their job \u2014 the pilot who landed the helicopter that spun out of control; the translator who kept others from entering the compound; the troops who separated the women and children from the fight; the SEALs who charged up the stairs. More than that, the mission only succeeded because every member of that unit trusted each other \u2014 because you can't charge up those stairs, into darkness and danger, unless you know that there's someone behind you, watching your back. Obama was blunt and declarative early in the speech, but \"lofty language returns for a big ending. We'll hear the story of the OBL raid a lot this year,\" Don Gonyea tweets. So it is with America. Each time I look at that flag, I'm reminded that our destiny is stitched together like those fifty stars and those thirteen stripes. No one built this country on their own. This Nation is great because we built it together. This Nation is great because we worked as a team. This Nation is great because we get each other's backs. And if we hold fast to that truth, in this moment of trial, there is no challenge too great; no mission too hard. As long as we're joined in common purpose, as long as we maintain our common resolve, our journey moves forward, and our future is hopeful, and the state of our Union will always be strong. Thank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.",

Islamist MPs took center stage as Egypt's parliament met for the first time since a popular uprising ousted Hosni Mubarak, while their supporters massed outside to cheer the historic event. As an Arab Spring country, Egypt has seen a tumultuous last year. Read Another Opinion On The Arab Spring Elliott Abrams is a senior fellow for Middle Eastern studies at the Council on Foreign Relations. There is a sour mood nowadays about the so-called Arab Spring. Armed gangs roam in Libya, Salafists win votes in Egypt, and minorities like the Egyptian Copts live in fear \u2014 as does the Shiite majority in Bahrain. The whole \"experiment\" seems to some critics to be a foolish, if idealistic project that promises to do nothing but wreak havoc in the Middle  East. These same critics cast blame at the Americans who applauded the Arab revolts of the past year: naive, ideological, ignorant, dangerous folk. As one of those folk, allow me to strike back. The failures of the Arab world's rulers were manifest and explicitly described well before 2011, and it was no secret that these deficiencies threatened their hold on power. In 2002, the U.N. Development Program's Arab Human Development Report noted that the spread of democracy in recent decades from Latin America to Eastern  Europe \"has barely reached the Arab States.\" It was precisely this lack of freedom, the report argued, that \"undermines human development and is one of the most painful manifestations of lagging political development.\" U.S. President George W. Bush recognized this stark reality. \"Are the peoples of the Middle East somehow beyond the reach of liberty? Are millions of men and women and children condemned by history or culture to live in despotism?\" he asked at the 20th anniversary of the National Endowment for Democracy. \"Sixty years of Western nations excusing and accommodating the lack of freedom in the Middle  East did nothing to make us safe \u2014 because in the long run, stability cannot be purchased at the expense of liberty.\" Bush and the U.N. Development Program's analysis were right, and those who judged that the old regimes could survive forever were wrong. What has been called \"authoritarian resilience\" turned out to be less impressive after all, and the popular hatred of those regimes much greater. The Arab Spring is therefore not a peculiarity of history, but a natural outcome for regimes that had quite simply become illegitimate in the eyes of their subjects. Of the possible sources of legitimacy \u2014 such as democracy, religion, monarchic succession, or the creation of great prosperity \u2014 they had none. They were kept in place solely by force, and they were far less stable than the vast majority of scholars, diplomats, and political leaders thought. They were not overthrown because Bush criticized them or President Barack Obama failed to shore them up, but because they lacked a coherent defense of their own rule. Thus the neocons, democrats, and others who applauded the Arab uprisings were right, for what was the alternative? To applaud continued oppression? To instruct the rulers on better tactics, the way Iran is presumably lecturing (and arming) Syria's Bashar al-Assad? Such a stance would have made a mockery of American ideals, would have failed to keep these hated regimes in place for very long, and would have left behind a deep, almost ineradicable anti-Americanism. This kind of so-called \"realpolitik\" is the path U.S. President Richard Nixon's administration took after the Greek military coup in 1967, and nearly a half-century later the Greeks have still not forgiven the United States. Of course, the best answer is that we should have been pushing harder for reform all along, but that is after all the Bush/neocon/democracy activist line. Take U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice's 2005 speech at the American University in Cairo or Bush's second inaugural address \u2014 both reviled by \"realists.\" It would be nice if some of the critics now admitted that such speeches were prophetic, even if the United  States was far too tentative in adopting, as Bush put it at the National Endowment for Democracy, \"a forward strategy of freedom in the Middle East.\" Instead, the critics condemn such a strategy for producing the dangers we now see. That is exactly wrong, for it was in fact the policy of ignoring gross oppression that helped bring us to the precipice of today's dangers. Bush, after all, was not urging instant remedies; he said democratization was \"the concentrated work of generations.\" He was urging reform, in part because it is usually far safer than revolution. Those who thought \"durable authoritarianism\" could persist forever have far more to apologize for than Bush, democracy activists, or neocons do. But we are where we are, so the next question is whether the Arab Spring will actually fulfill its promise of greater democratic rights or whether it will simply usher in an era of extremist Islamist regimes or new forms of authoritarianism. The pessimists might yet be proved right \u2014 any comparison of the Arab lands to Eastern Europe suggests that many positive elements are missing, not least the magnet and model of the European Union. Nothing is inevitable, though. African countries such as Botswana, Ghana, and Mali \u2014 and India, for that matter \u2014 have attained democracy despite poverty, low literacy rates, and social divisions roughly similar to those that exist in the Arab world. Nor does experience suggest that Islamist victories are unavoidable \u2014 or at least, are permanent. A study of 21 Islamic countries conducted by scholars Charles Kurzman and Ijlal Naqvi found that Islamist parties fare far more poorly than popularly believed and gain their highest vote total in the first election. Kurzman and Naqvi describe a common political arc for Islamist parties. They often emerge from the oppression of the previous regime with a reputation for honesty and courage, and attract many voters who are not zealots. Then when they fail to produce tangible results \u2014 when, to put it starkly, Islam turns out not to be the answer \u2014 many voters turn elsewhere. As the authors put it, \"when Muslims are given the opportunity to vote freely for Islamic parties, they have tended not to do so.\" There are plenty of caveats, of course. Islamist parties do better on average in Arab than non-Arab lands, and in any event, this process takes time, often requiring second and third free elections. But time is also part of the antidote to extremism. As Bush noted in his speech at the National Endowment for Democracy, \"The daily work of democracy itself is the path of progress. It teaches cooperation, the free exchange of ideas, and the peaceful resolution of differences.\" So can Islamist parties learn to play along? Kurzman and Naqvi say yes: \"[T]he Islamic parties' overall trend toward publicly embracing global norms of democracy and human rights is significant.... The experience of political participation, both in government and in civil society, has changed their outlooks in ways that they did not imagine when they started down the path of electoral politics.\" Again, stripping away long-standing and deeply rooted authoritarian systems is a long, dangerous, and violent process. If disorder and economic collapse are the result, we may see the Russian experience repeated: Democracy is equated with chaos; a Vladimir Putin emerges. As we see now in Russia, though, with the surprisingly poor showing of Putin's ruling party in the recent parliamentary elections and the mass protests in Moscow, this too does not appear to last forever. As the old Arab regimes have found out the hard way during the past year, authoritarian rule is inherently unstable. Simply put, people want more. \"[T]he regime is branded as an expedient, something temporary and transitional needed to meet the exigencies of the time,\" Columbia University professor Andrew Nathan wrote about China's communist system. \"Authoritarian regimes in this sense are not forever. For all their diversity and longevity, they live under the shadow of the future, vulnerable to existential challenges that mature democratic systems do not face.\" The new governments of the Middle  East will need to win the loyalties of populations that seek more dignity, more freedom from oppression, and better lives. Arab culture will prove an obstacle to moving forward: Both the treatment of women and the widespread conspiracy theories blaming Jews and others for national failures will undermine a population's ability to take responsibility for its own future. Years of danger lie ahead, and there will surely be very uneven patterns of democratization \u2014 as has been the case, after all, not only in Africa and Latin America, but even in Europe. But the sour \"analysis\" that the Arab revolts will lead only, inevitably, and permanently to disaster is based in neither experience nor scholarship. What should the United States do? Batten down the hatches, for one thing. Who can say what Egypt's or Libya's political situation will be in two years, or four? Prepare to protect U.S. interests and America's allies if, during this long and uneven process, they are threatened. In addition, what America should do is help: help the liberals, the constitutionalists, the democrats, and the human rights advocates, whose enemies \u2014 in the mosques or streets or barracks \u2014 will have plenty of outside support. You might call it adopting a \"forward strategy of freedom,\" requiring, as Bush said, \"persistence and energy and idealism.\" We will not determine the outcome of these struggles, but we can do our utmost to help the good guys win, and win sooner.

            "article_content": "by Ben Marcus Paperback, 289 pages | Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How? In an election year, nasty rhetoric is par for the course. But what if all that toxic language was, well, actually toxic? That's the premise of The Flame Alphabet, the new novel by Ben Marcus. When Sam and his wife begin feeling sick, they're not sure  why. But when their teenage daughter, Esther, leaves the house, the couple recovers. The horrifying prospect dawns on them that their daughter \u2014 specifically, her speech -- is poisoning them. Soon it becomes clear that the sickness is spreading beyond their small Jewish community. \"I've always thought of language as extremely potent,\" Marcus tells NPR's  Audie Cornish. \"It seems to change us at the chemical and  biological level. When I think of it like that, it's as though it's a  drug \u2014 and what would happen if we took too much of it, if it  overwhelmed us and started to make us sick?\" Language \u2014 its power and limitations, abundance and poverty \u2014 have long preoccupied Marcus, whose knotty, formally experimental books The Age of Wire and String and Notable American Women pushed the novel and short story genres to their frontiers of their forms. But to prepare for The Flame Alphabet, he delved into the past. \"I did a lot of  research into Christian and Jewish mysticism, which is very much, in  some sense, opposed to language, or it sees religious experience as  being above or beyond language,\" Marcus says. \"Language can't reach that ineffable  feeling we might have in a religious sense. So I wanted to wonder what  we'd be like if we couldn't communicate with each other. Is it a  desperately lonely experience, or is there something possibly religious  to it? In The Flame Alphabet, as the toxic speech epidemic spreads, the world falls into a curious communal silence. These were scenes that presented technical pleasures and challenges. \"it was  interesting to write scenes in which people couldn't talk or even look  each other in the eye,\" Marcus says. \"Even the television that they watch has been  censored so the faces of the characters have been smeared over.\" Ben Marcus is the author of The Age of Wire and String and Notable American Women. He teaches at Columbia University.\n                \n                    \n                     /Michael Lionstar\n                    \n                \nhide caption Given this state of affairs, even the most mundane interactions  between parents and child take on a sinister aura. Despite knowing that  Esther is sickening them, Sam and Claire are still drawn to her speech,  her writing, her thoughts. \"We feasted on the putrid  material,\" Sam tells us, \"because our daughter made it. We gorged on it, and inside us it  steamed, rotted, turned rank.\" \"There's that incredible loyalty  you have as a parent,\" Marcus says,  \"And it's a loyalty that to me is  almost biological, which allows us to  love our children  unconditionally. I was interested in that conflict \u2014  the cause of your  sickness is there in your home, but it's also the  cause of your  greatest love.\" And as Sam is stripped of language and flails as he struggles to protect his family, he discovers a stubborn, silent humanity that persists \u2014 perhaps predates \u2014 language and doesn't depend upon communication. \"He can no longer use  language himself, but of course, we have access to his thoughts,\" Marcus says. \"He says he feels closer than ever to his family, now that he  doesn't think in words anymore. So there might be a romantic notion  that, beyond language, we still have deeply emotional lives, that we  still feel sorrow and joy, that language is one thing we use to share  it, but if we're no longer sharing, we might still very much be human.\"",

NPR journalists traveled the full length of the Trans-Siberian railroad and report on how Russia's history has shaped its people, and where, 20 years after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russians want their country to go. First of three parts Two decades after the collapse of communist rule, just where is Russia headed? Scholars, diplomats and poets are spending careers contemplating the question. In my two years as NPR's Moscow-based correspondent, I traveled widely in Russia and talked to wealthy businessmen, powerful politicians and poor pensioners. And before returning to Washington, in one last reporting trip, I hoped to make my most ambitious effort yet at tapping the mood of the country and its people. I knew it would be impossible to capture the essence of a country in one journey. But I wanted to  try; so I took the train across Russia. The timing was right. Recently, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has been challenged by street protests that hint at dissatisfaction and dissent. The train journey was a chance not only to see the country and explore its history, but also to gauge the sentiment of Russians far from prosperous Moscow. My route \u2014 the nearly 6,000 miles of the Trans-Siberian railroad \u2014 is a pathway that's loomed large in Russia's history. Anna Konstantinovna, the lively woman who directs a Moscow museum devoted to transportation and the train, explained to me how the Trans-Siberian moved soldiers to the front lines of Russian wars, helped Russians maintain their holdings in the Far East, and improved trade throughout the country. There was a darker side, as well: The train carried exiles and political prisoners to forced labor camps and prisons during both tsarist and Soviet times. Today, the railway is an important form of transportation in a country where air travel is too expensive for many. Most people aboard the Trans-Siberian are Russians, traveling to visit family members scattered across this huge country. During the long rides, passengers sit, read, chat and welcome visitors. Friendships are formed over food. In the first hour of our journey, a woman in the compartment next door had already offered us chunks of her Belarussian sausage, along with homemade horseradish with sour cream. All food is accompanied by steaming hot tea, Russia's proudest addiction. Shaped By Tragedy And Hardship The Trans-Siberian is epic, colorful and fascinating \u2014 but it can also be a bit of an ordeal, as can much of life in Russia. Russians are very well-acquainted with ordeals. Millions were enslaved as serfs under the tsars. They were repressed during Soviet times. Over the past two decades, Russians have felt more personal freedom, but there's also much poverty in the country, and political upheaval. Tragedy and hardship always seem to shape Russia's character. We were reminded of that by one passenger, Sergei Yovlev, a middle-aged man sharply dressed in a navy blue pinstriped suit. His hometown, Yaroslavl \u2014 located just a few hours northeast of the Russian capital \u2014 was in the news last summer, when nearly every member of the hockey-loving city's professional team, Lokomotiv, was killed after the team plane crashed on takeoff. My personal opinion is that progress makes a person absolutely weak. He loses his strength because he doesn't need to think how to survive. Ella Stroganova, curator of the museum in the Russian city of Yaroslavl Yovlev, who works for the Russian railroad, just stared blankly when we asked him about the accident. Then, he began reciting names. \"I can name all of them,\" he said of the team members. \"What happened was a true tragedy. But we'll survive.\" Living through tragedy, he said, is a quality that is \"built into a Russian person's soul.\" Russians do survive. That's apparent in Yaroslavl, where despite the tragedy, hockey is alive and well, in part thanks to a youth training program. At a hockey arena on the outskirts of the city, some 20 or so 11-year-olds chased pucks and skated in drills as their coach, Ivan Dobryakov, looked on. He takes his job \u2014 developing this next generation of players \u2014 very seriously. The Lokomotiv tragedy took a toll on him and his players. \"We lost something that is impossible to get back,\" he explained. \"We do have a feeling of emptiness. Yet, as long as this hockey school works, we will have a future.\" 'Progress Makes A Person Weak' There is something especially stoic about the way Russians accept tragedy. A year ago, I covered a suicide bombing at Moscow's main airport, where 35 people were killed. In the U.S., that airport might have been shut down for days. In Moscow, planes were taking off and landing again right away. And people went right back to work, as though nothing had happened. The cab driver who drove me home had been splattered with blood in the bombing and was back behind the wheel of his cab, having never changed clothes. Inside Yaroslavl's small city museum, photos hanging on the wall are of local residents who died in dictator Josef Stalin's gulags. The curator at the museum, Ella Stroganova, told us she proudly puts Russia's pain on display. It's what has defined this country's older generation. \"They always ready to meet difficulties,\" Stroganova said. \"Maybe because the practice of their lives showed revolution, civil war, World War II \u2014 always difficulties, tragedies, and everything like that.\" Her concern is that the comparative ease of modern life in Russia may actually cause the younger generation to lose what it means to be Russian. \"My personal opinion is that progress makes a person absolutely weak. He loses his strength because he doesn't need to think how to survive,\" Stroganova said. Hardship, it seems, is a way of life that makes Russians stronger. And, given that mentality, it explains the relationship Russians have traditionally had with their leaders. Putin and those who governed before him have rarely taken the blame for difficult times, since they're accepted as reality in Russian life. But as we spoke with citizens around the country, we began to sense a desire for change.",

Read An Opinion On Rick Santorum's Chances In New Hamshire Read An Opinion On Rick Santorum's Strategy Going Forward Ben Adler is a contributing writer at The Nation, reporting on Republican and conservative politics and media. He previously covered national politics and policy for Newsweek, Politico and the Center for American Progress. Political reporters and pundits \u2014 especially conservatives \u2014 often fail to appreciate the distinction between political strategy and substantive policy. That's why so many conservative media outlets falsely asserted that President Obama was planning to \"abandon the working class\" when they got wind of a Center for American Progress report laying out how Obama could win re-election without winning the white working class vote. Now Rick Santorum is talking about economic opportunity and the importance of manufacturing jobs, so mainstream reporters and conservative commentators have dubbed him a candidate for the working class. Here's The Washington Post: \"In a speech capping off his near-win in the Iowa caucuses Tuesday night, he made plain he wants to introduce another side to New Hampshire voters: Rick Santorum, economic populist. He insisted that conservatives must make clear they care about the problems of the working-class and not just cut taxes... He can do it, he said, with a tax plan that eliminates the corporate income tax for manufacturers, in an effort to lure factories back from overseas.\" The article describes Santorum's political strategy to win over working class voters without raising the key question: does Santorum actually propose to do anything that would benefit the working class? No, of course he doesn't. Santorum's agenda is an extremely right wing collection of conservative hobbyhorses. Look at Matthew Yglesias' breakdown Santorum's 12-point tax plan: They're a bunch of typical Republican proposals that have no particular relevance for the working poor. His proposals include the usual Republican tax cuts for the rich to incentivize investment and for families to incentivize procreation. There's no mention of even using tax cuts \u2014 such as the Earned Income Tax Credit \u2014 to lift working people out of poverty. The Post treats a plan to eliminate corporate taxes as a credible plan to heal the economic wounds of working class people without even bothering to ask, much less assess, he would actually impact the average working American. For the vast majority of Americans who no longer work in manufacturing, his plan is quite a bank shot. Santorum's idea springs from a fundamentally outdated notion of the American economy: that men can work in heavy industry while their wives stay home and raise the kids. That socially traditionalist image is appealing to Santorum, but it's no longer the world we live in. And it fails to take account of technological changes that have made manufacturing less labor intensive. We are losing manufacturing jobs to more than other countries: automation means that we can produce more goods with fewer workers. By taking Santorum's strange proposal at face value the Post treats a rather implausible claim as presumptively credible. Meanwhile The New York Times' duo conservative op-ed columnists Ross Douthat and David Brooks heap praise on Santorum's supposed concern for the working class. \"The former Pennsylvania senator's emphasis on social mobility, family breakdown and blue-collar struggles spoke more directly to the challenges facing working Americans than any 9-9-9 fantasy or flat-tax gambit,\" writes Douthat, who apparently hasn't actually bothered to look at Santorum's tax plan. Brooks devoted an entire column on Tuesday to praising Santorum for speaking for the interests of the Republicans' largest constituency, the white working class. \"The Republicans harvest their votes but have done a poor job responding to their needs.... Enter Rick Santorum.... His economic arguments are couched as values arguments: If you want to enhance long-term competitiveness, you need to strengthen families. If companies want productive workers, they need to be embedded in wholesome communities.\" That's all very sweet, but it's just empty rhetoric. Brooks fails to identify a single concrete proposal Santorum makes that would do anything tangible for the working class. That's because Santorum doesn't have any. So Brooks starts by acknowledging that Republicans cater to that demographic rhetorically but not substantively, and then swoons over Santorum for doing exactly that. Conservative columnists and reporters like to listen to rhetoric and talk in generalities because it's easier than actually examining proposals. But it doesn't take a master's degree in public policy to see that Santorum's tax plans are regressive. For most of the economic challenges facing working Americans, Santorum's policies are simply generic Republican corporatism. Take health insurance: Santorum would repeal \"Obamacare\" and do virtually nothing to insure the uninsured or contain costs. He merely offers the same proposals Republicans trot out every four years to please corporate contributors and sound like they have a plan. His scheme \u2014 tort reform to reduce the cost of malpractice insurance, allowing insurance across state lines and health savings accounts \u2014 would do little to address the problem for people with prior conditions or high health care costs. When it comes to the other challenges to upward mobility, or even just getting by, that blue collar workers face, Santorum offers nothing, or worse. Say you're worried about the cost of sending your kids to college: Santorum has literally no policy prescription to address that problem. But his overall promise to cut domestic social spending would presumably mean even less federal help for college tuition. It would also mean less federal help with basic necessities for people who lose their jobs, such as Medicaid and food stamps. The totality of Santorum's domestic policy agenda is to cut spending. This shouldn't even pass for conservative economic populism. I'm willing to concede that one can demonstrate concern for the poor not just by spending more but by proposing to reorient programs to make them more effective or to make their goals empowerment rather than dependency. But Santorum doesn't have any such ideas; he just wants to steal from the poor to give to the rich. Specifically, he proposes to, \"Freeze spending levels for social programs for 5 years such as Medicaid, Housing, Education, Job Training, and Food Stamps, time limit restrictions, and block grant to the States like in Welfare Reform.\" Santorum also proposes to cut funding for the National Labor Relations Board as a punitive measure for making a decision he dislikes. The especially sad irony is that these sorts of spending cuts will save a small amount of money compared to, say, the amount we've blown on the Iraq invasion that Santorum supported. The real savings will come from his plan to cut Social Security benefits, raise the retirement age and means-test it, as well as adopting Paul Ryan's plan to privatize Medicare. How can Douthat and Santorum claim with a straight face that this constitutes some sort of plan to help the working class? How can news reporters write that Santorum seeks to be the working class candidate without noting that his policies would snatch the social safety net out from under them? Rick Santorum has nothing to offer the working class except his ideological contention that tax cuts will magically create jobs that pay you enough to meet your needs.

            "article_content": "Burmese opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi is getting an honorary doctorate from Oxford Wednesday. Last week, she formally accepted the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo. As she tours Europe, Suu Kyi is being honored for her nonviolent political protest against a military junta that kept her under house arrest for most of the last 20 years. But her philosophy of civil disobedience might have to change to fit her new role as a politician back home.  RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: She lived for more than 20 years in virtual isolation in her home country of Myanmar, formerly known as Burma. Now, pro-democracy activist Aung San Suu Kyi is midway through a European tour in which she's meeting statesmen, celebrities and others who have admired her from afar. She has formally accepted the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo, and today she's collected an honorary doctorate from her alma mater, Oxford University. But amidst all this, there are suggestions that her philosophy of civil disobedience and what's called spiritual revolution might have to change to fit her new role back home. NPR's Anthony Kuhn reports from Oxford. ANTHONY KUHN, BYLINE: One of the most dramatic moments in Suu Kyi's nonviolent confrontation with the military came during the election campaign of 1988. The actual incident was dramatized in last year's movie \"The Lady,\" in which Malaysian actress Michelle Yeoh plays Suu Kyi. (SOUNDBITE OF CROWD CHATTER) KUHN: In a small Burmese town, soldiers level their rifles and threaten to shoot Suu Kyi and members of her National League for Democracy if they try to pass. (SOUNDBITE OF MOVIE, \"THE LADY\") MICHELLE YEOH: (as Aung San Suu Kyi) We will continue in a calm and orderly fashion. (Foreign language spoken). KUHN: Suu Kyi stares them down and walks alone, right through their line. In a speech broadcast by the BBC last year, Aung San Suu Kyi says she found inspiration for her tactics in the independent struggle of Burma's neighbor, India. AUNG SAN SUU KYI: I was attracted to the way of non-violence, but not on moral grounds, as some believe, only on practical, political grounds. It is simply based on my conviction that we need to put an end to the tradition of regime change through violence, a tradition that has become the running sore of Burmese politics. KUHN: But Krishna Mallick, a philosophy professor at Salem State University in Massachusetts, says Suu Kyi draws on Mahatma Gandhi's idea of not defeating an opponent, but transforming him or her by moral example. KRISHNA MALLICK: The whole idea of this nonviolence is to help make the other side realize that what they're doing is wrong. So it is changing their morals, but without using any force. KUHN: She says Suu Kyi also drew on Martin Luther King, Jr. and his tactic of making injustice visible. MALLICK: Like Martin Luther King, Jr. had done, you know, where he says in his \"Letter from a Birmingham Jail,\" that you have to make the injustice visible. So I think she has accomplished that. She has made the injustice visible to the Western world. KUHN: Juliane Schober, an anthropologist of religion at Arizona State University in Tempe, says that Suu Kyi's Buddhist faith also contains traditions of protest. JULIANE SCHOBER: I would characterize her as being part of a broader Buddhist movement called socially engaged Buddhism.  The Dalai Lama is part of that. So is Thich Nhat Hanh in Vietnam - the idea being that first, you need to take care of people's material needs. KUHN: In Saturday's Nobel lecture, Suu Kyi suggested that her spirituality grew more intense as a result of her confinement. Cut off from the outer world, she withdrew into an inner world of meditation. KYI: It felt as though I were no longer part of the real world. There was a house which was my world. There was a world of others who also were not free, but who were together in prison as a community. And there was the world of the free. Each one was a different planet pursuing its own separate cause in an indifferent universe. KUHN: But now, some critics say Suu Kyi's so-called spiritual revolution is a distraction from more concrete issues of politics and policy. Schober argues that Suu Kyi will have to be careful to speak in less religious terms in order to represent all of Myanmar's people, including non-Buddhist minorities. SCHOBER: The power of the state in Myanmar, as it is about to unfold, can't be based on Buddhist sources. It must be based on the sense of the constitution and secular power in the modern state. KUHN: Here in Oxford and elsewhere in Europe, Suu Kyi's political ascent is being feted as a triumph of democracy and nonviolence. But any sense of vindication could quickly disappear if the accommodation she's reached with the government collapses and her freedoms are once again curtailed. Also, her legacy as a protest leader could be tarnished if her policies as a politician back in Myanmar fail to make a dent in the country's endemic poverty, corruption and ethnic strife.

            "article_content": "The erosion of President Obama's support among white voters means he must rely even more on nonwhites.\n                \n                    \n                    Tony Dejak/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption The erosion of President Obama's support among white voters means he must rely even more on nonwhites. While much of what will happen on Election Day is now unknowable, we can predict with certainty that President Obama won't win a majority of the white vote. No news there. No Democratic presidential candidate, after all, has received the support of most white voters since President Lyndon Johnson's 1964 historic rout of Sen. Barry Goldwater of Arizona. Still, four years ago, Obama did manage to get a very respectable 43 percent of white voters to choose him over Goldwater's Senate successor from Arizona, Sen. John McCain. That was then. As Election Day 2012 nears, Obama appears unlikely to come anywhere near to attracting the percentage of overall white voters he did four years ago. But that may not matter because of growth in voter groups much more inclined to back the nation's first black president, members of minority groups, especially African-Americans and Latinos, who can counter Obama's losses with many white voters, especially those defined as working class. How bad are Obama's prospects with white voters? A recent Washington Post-ABC News poll put Obama's support among white voters at 38 percent, dangerous territory for a president seeking re-election. The same poll placed Republican Mitt Romney's support from white voters at 59 percent. The Washington Post reported that was the lowest level of support for a Democratic presidential candidate since 1988, when Michael Dukakis received 40 percent of the white vote against then-Vice President George H.W. Bush. (The Roper Center indicates Bill Clinton came in slightly lower than that in 1992, at 39 percent of the white vote in a three-way race featuring Bush and Ross Perot.) In 2008, Obama lost white working-class voters to McCain by 18 points. He's not the only Democrat to fare poorly with these voters. In the 2010 congressional midterm election, which found Democrats losing control of the House, Democrats lost the white working-class vote to Republicans by 30 points. There appear to be exceptions, however, as in all-important Ohio. A recent Quinnipiac University poll showed Obama trailing Romney among white voters without a college degree there by only 4 percentage points \u2014 Romney, 49 percent, Obama 45 percent. That helps explain why in a number of Ohio polls, Obama has a small lead over Romney. For Romney to win Ohio, he would need to drive down Obama's support with white voters, said Peter Brown, assistant director of the university's polling institute, who was quoted in a news release: \"President Obama won 46 percent of the white vote in Ohio in 2008 when he carried the state by five points. Romney probably needs to hold Mr. Obama to less than 40 percent of the white vote if he is to win Ohio, and he has a ways to go at this point.\" Even as Obama's support from white voters has slipped, those losses have been offset, more or less, by other voters, as minorities, who identify strongly with the Democratic Party, become a larger part of the population of eligible voters. \"It depends on what you're putting the emphasis on, right?' said Ruy Teixeira, one of Washington's better-known political demographers, in an interview. Teixeira has long buoyed Democrats with his predictions that the nation's changing demographics favor Democrats. \"Is it more interesting that Obama's going to do worse among whites or is it more interesting that Obama is going to hold all of his minority support from 2008 and then some, which is actually quite remarkable?\" In April, and in a report called \"The Path to 270,\" Teixeira argued that Obama's support from minority voters could result in the president's winning re-election even if Romney outperforms the numbers McCain got nationally among white voters. As Teixeira explained at an April panel discussion at the Bipartisan Policy Center in Washington, Obama could still win even if he does as badly with white voters as the 2010 congressional Democrats (again, they lost white working-class voters by 30 points. They lost college-educated whites by 19 points). And Obama could still win if he does as badly as Sen. John Kerry in 2004 against President George W. Bush. The Democratic presidential nominee that election cycle lost white working-class and college-educated voters by 23 percent and 11 percent respectively. Teixeira told the audience at the April event: \"Obama could do as badly as John Kerry did, but the country has changed enough in the last eight years, he could still pull out the election if he got 75 percent of the minority vote.\" And that 75 percent is a somewhat conservative figure. Obama's support from nonwhites is hovering above 80 percent, according to polling from the Washington Post-ABC News. A quick look at population changes in battleground states illustrates why the Obama campaign has reason for confidence despite the challenges of being an incumbent president during a period of relatively high joblessness. Here's the growth of the nonwhite eligible voter populations in battleground states between November 2008 and May 2012, according to William Frey of the Brookings Institution, another of Washington's better-known demographers: Nevada, up 9 percent; North Carolina, up 4 percent; Florida, up 4 percent, and Colorado, up 3 percent. The white share of the eligible voting population declined in all those states. Even more important than the percentages of whites, blacks and Latinos in the electorate is who actually turns out to vote. In 2008, Obama benefited from lower intensity levels among white Republican voters who didn't turn out for McCain in the necessary numbers. All indications are that 2012 should be different. Republicans are demonstrating significantly more enthusiasm than in 2008, buoyed by the thought of ousting Obama and placing Romney in the White House. Frey ran some computer simulations of what could happen on Election Day. One scenario mimicked the higher turnout of white voters in the 2004 general election and the enthusiastic turnout of nonwhite voters in 2008 for Obama. Obama won the election, but not by much. \"Demographics, not just meaning the underlying demographics, of course, but the eligible voter population and the turnout, which is important, that's still kind of a question mark,\" for Election Day 2012, Frey said. \"We can do all these simulations, but we really don't know who's going to turn out and how big those turnouts are going to be.\"",

In Ohio, a new congressional district that stretches along Lake Erie between Toledo and Cleveland has become a political portrait of polarized America. The 9th District is one of the results of Ohio's loss of two representatives following the last census. The primary for the redrawn district pitted two longtime Democratic incumbents against each other. Now the victor, Rep. Marcy Kaptur, is taking on a Republican known for his role in the 2008 presidential election. In his working-class Toledo neighborhood, Joe Wurzelbacher can point out the very spot where, four years ago, he stepped in front of a TV camera trained on presidential candidate Barack Obama, who was in town canvassing for votes. He told Obama that he was getting ready to buy a company that made more than $250,000 a year. \"Your new tax plan is going to tax me more, isn't it?\" he asked. Candidate Obama proceeded to explain his tax plan, at one point saying that it was important to \"spread the wealth around.\" That remark didn't play well for the Democrat, who was accused by GOP rival John McCain of being out of touch with the tax burden borne by working-class America \u2014 exemplified by \"Joe the Plumber.\" Four years later, Wurzelbacher has ridden his fame as \"Joe the Plumber\" into the role of GOP standard-bearer against Kaptur. Dave Cohen of the University of Akron's Bliss Institute of Applied Politics says the candidates offer voters a stark choice. Rep. Marcy Kaptur, D-Ohio, meets shipyard workers in Cleveland before a christening ceremony on May 2.\n                \n                    \n                    Mark Duncan/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Rep. Marcy Kaptur, D-Ohio, meets shipyard workers in Cleveland before a christening ceremony on May 2. \"Marcy Kaptur represents, really, the consummate insider politician. She's been a fairly moderate Democrat, very strong on defense. And Wurzelbacher, he represents, really, the Tea Party movement \u2014 anti-establishment \u2014 and is very much respected and somewhat beloved by social conservatives,\" Cohen says. \"The 9th District race is really a nice microcosm of the battles and the culture wars that are going on in the country right now.\" Raising Money The battle for the 9th District also demonstrates the financial challenges of mounting a modern political campaign. Kaptur says raising money is tough. \"We now have to advertise in two media markets, Cleveland and Toledo, and Cleveland is five times more expensive than the western part of the state,\" she says. \"So, it's quite a daunting task, and there's never enough.\" While Wurzelbacher can't match Kaptur's accumulated war chest and national contacts, he's using his renown as \"Joe the Plumber\" to attract campaign dollars. \"We have an online presence that's pretty huge,\" he says. \"Part of that, obviously, comes from my run-in with Barack Obama. So, we can reach pretty much all of the country and fundraise.\" An analysis of Federal Election Commission data from this cycle shows more than three-quarters of each candidate's funding in Ohio's 9th District race has come from outside Ohio. Marcy KapturContributions from Ohio: $82,650Total contributions: $358,450 Joe WurzelbacherContributions from Ohio: $14,892Total contributions: $65,667 Outside Dollars But reaching all over the country has meant that more than three-quarters of each candidate's funding has come from outside Ohio, according to an NPR analysis of Federal Election Commission reports this cycle. \"That might show you how bad the economy is around here and how tight it is,\" Wurzelbacher says. \"People don't want to give money; it's very difficult for them.\" Kaptur argues that most of her funders, even those with outside addresses, have roots in Ohio. Still, she's concerned about how much of her time is devoted to fundraising. \"It's turned into an endless campaign, where you're having to raise all these very egregious amounts of money just to be able to compete,\" she says. \"When you have some campaigns where you're raising 20 and 30 times more than the job pays, it's out of bounds.\" And when the majority of that money is coming from outside donors, instead of constituents, it's likely to change the nature of the race.",

A president just re-elected has arguably the most political capital he's likely to have during his entire second term. And President Obama clearly has some capital, though he didn't overtly refer to it or vow to \"spend it,\" as his predecessor George W. Bush famously said upon his 2004 re-election. But in his first post-election news conference, while Obama didn't openly talk about spending his political capital, it was fairly obvious he plans to do just that. Whether the issue was his proposal for avoiding the so-called fiscal cliff or reforming the nation's immigration laws, the president sounded like a man confident he would have the majority of voters with him. Among the unanswerable questions for the moment, however, is just how much political capital the president gained in his re-election, and when would it run out? That sense that the president had the political winds at his back seemed to extend to an area where the public mood is more ambiguous \u2014 the attack on the American Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, that left four Americans dead. In one of his feistiest moments of the news conference, Obama rebuked congressional critics of U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice, which include his 2008 rival for the White House, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. One area where the president certainly appeared to have more leverage after the election was in fiscal negotiations with congressional Republicans to avert the significant tax cuts and spending increases that would begin to take effect early next year if no accord is reached. As he has for the better part of his presidency, Obama called for any agreement to include higher tax rates on the wealthiest Americans, not just spending cuts. General elections have consequences, and one of them is that they come with exit polls. And those polls show some 60 percent of those surveyed agreeing with the president that taxes should be raised on at least the highest income earners. And as the president noted, not all of those people are Democrats. In response to a reporter's question, he said: \"I think every voter out there understood that that was an important debate, and the majority of voters agreed with me, not \u2014 by the way, more voters agreed with me on this issue than voted for me. \"So we've got a clear majority of the American people who recognize if we're going to be serious about deficit reduction, we've got to do it in a balanced way.\" But even with a public that very much wants to see an agreement from Washington policymakers, Obama was careful not to suggest that it had to be his way or else. Obama wanted it known that he was keeping an open mind, to a point: \"I am open to new ideas. If the Republican counterparts or some Democrats have a great idea for us to raise revenue, maintain progressivity, make sure the middle class isn't getting hit, reduces our deficit, encourages growth, I'm not going to just slam the door in their face.\" That is, unless congressional Republicans make claims that supply-side economics could solve the problem. A president obviously emboldened by last Tuesday's results said he wouldn't stand for that. That is a point of looming conflict for Obama and Republican negotiators. In his public utterances since Election Day, House Speaker John Boehner has not used the words \"supply-side economics.\" But his remarks suggest that the idea that lower taxes inevitably lead to faster economic growth and eventually higher tax receipts appears to still be very much a part of his thinking. In any event, in response to a reporter's question about whether he had a mandate coming out of the election, the president didn't reject the idea. But he framed it in the same way he had during the campaign, that he, not the Republicans, was the true champion of the middle class: \"With respect to the issue of mandate, I've got one mandate. I've got a mandate to help middle-class families and families that are working hard to try to get into the middle class. That's my mandate.\" That could be a powerful and oft-repeated line in the fiscal-cliff negotiations to come, especially as the president continues to allege that by resisting higher tax rates for the wealthy and pushing for deep social spending cuts, Republicans were choosing to hurt the middle class. While it's difficult to see how Obama and Capitol Hill Republicans reconcile the president's wish that the rich pay taxes at a higher rate and the GOP's determination to maintain current tax rates or even cut them, there could be more agreement between the sides on immigration reform. Republicans can read the exit polls as well as Obama can, and those polls indicated that 65 percent of all voters want reforms that would give illegal immigrants a path to citizenship. That Obama won 71 percent support from the nation's fastest growing minority group \u2014 Latinos \u2014 who were 10 percent of the Election Day turnout, higher than ever before, provided Republicans with a wake-up call that has numerous GOP lawmakers calling for reform and a less hard-line immigration stance from their party. If immigration was an issue on which Obama was likely to find common ground with Republicans, the potential appeared high for a clash between Obama and Republican lawmakers over the tragedy in Libya. McCain and Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina have gone on record with their opposition to the possibility that Obama would name Rice to succeed Hillary Clinton as secretary of state, when Clinton formally decides to step down. Their objections to Rice, McCain and Graham have said, are based on her initial public statements that the Sept. 11, 2012, violence that killed U.S. Ambassador to Libya Christopher Stevens and three other Americans was a reaction to an anti-Muslim video. According to administration officials and Obama on Wednesday, Rice was just relating the initial information she was provided through U.S. intelligence channels. The resurgence of the Libya issue harkens back to the just ended presidential campaign. In the second presidential debate, Mitt Romney's use of the Libya tragedy to attack Obama was widely viewed as a dud. That was in part because Obama used that attack to show the kind of fire he lacked during his infamous first-debate performance. Using language similar to what he employed during the second debate, Obama on Wednesday said that for Republicans to \"besmirch [Rice's] reputation is outrageous.\" And then he put Senate Republicans on notice that if he eventually decides Rice is the best person for the State Department post, he would very well nominate her. Whether Obama will ultimately want to wage a nomination battle with Senate Republicans over Rice, and whether Republicans would hold together against her, remains to be seen. But while foreign policy didn't prove to be a decisive factor in the election, it appeared Obama could at least contemplate using some of his newly gained and hard-won political capital in a looming foreign policy fight.",

Maybe it's just math, but it may also be a great political accomplishment. President Obama has put together a coalition that's not only been a winner for him, but promises to pay dividends to his party for years to come. A mix of minorities, young people and educated white professionals has now driven him to two majority-vote presidential victories \u2014 the first Democrat to pull that off since Franklin D. Roosevelt. \"What historians and political scientists will focus on is that he changed the coalition of the Democratic Party,\" says Villanova University political scientist Lara Brown. \"The new coalition is groups with ascendant demographics \u2014 new minorities and young people.\" As has been widely noted this week, Obama managed to recapture broad support from groups largely responsible for his 2008 election: African-Americans, Hispanics, Asians, single women, and young and highly educated whites. Mitt Romney won 59 percent of the overall white vote, according to exit polling. With whites shrinking as a share of the electorate \u2014 and Republicans struggling to appeal to minorities \u2014 it wasn't enough. To some extent, Obama was building on past party success. Minority groups have traditionally favored Democrats, and women haven't given a majority of their votes to a Republican since 1988. \"It's important to keep in mind that the voting patterns contributing to the president's re-election are not new,\" says Scott Keeter, a pollster with the Pew Research Center. \"The strong support of young people for Democratic candidates is relatively recent, but it predates Obama \u2014 young voters were John Kerry's best age group in 2004.\" Obama benefited from the growth in the minority share of the electorate. But he was also able to build up the margins among such groups. African-Americans, for instance, gave 88 percent of their vote to Kerry in 2004; Obama won 93 percent of their vote this year and 95 percent in 2008. A bigger share of Hispanics voted for Obama than for some earlier Democrats, too \u2014 and more of them were voting. What's more, they cast votes in strategically important states. \"My own feeling is the Democrats may have dodged a bullet because Republicans did not try to compete with much of Obama's demographic base, especially Hispanics,\" says William Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Institution. \"This may have cost them Florida, Nevada, Colorado and possibly Virginia.\" 2016 And Beyond But while Obama has clearly marked a path toward success for Democratic candidates, there's no guarantee they'll be able to stay on it. Obama may have a special appeal for certain minority groups as the nation's first African-American president. And his campaign was especially assiduous about turning out members of demographic groups previously notorious for failing to vote as reliably as whites and senior citizens. Amara Hayles, 6, sits atop her dad's shoulders as the crowd shouts \"four more years\" during a speech by President Obama Nov. 5 in Columbus, Ohio.\n                \n                    \n                    Carolyn Kaster/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption It remains to be seen whether Latino and African-American voters will regularly turn out for Democrats \"with someone other than Obama atop the ticket,\" writes Sean Trende, an elections analyst with Real Clear Politics. Democrats are feeling pretty optimistic. Not only is Obama a two-time winner, he's won over groups that will continue to grow as a share of the electorate. (Remember that this was the year when minority births in the U.S. outweighed those of whites for the first time.) Obama, in fact, has given the party its first stable coalition of support that is big enough to win national elections since the New Deal coalition put together by FDR \u2014 a solidly Democratic South wedded to farmers, union labor and white ethnics in the North and Midwest. That coalition began to fray in the late 1960s, when civil rights legislation damaged Democrats politically in the South and liberal activists in the party began to alienate working-class whites in the Midwest and elsewhere. Just as Republicans today are wondering how they can make inroads with Hispanics, Democrats debated for years whether they needed to work on regaining some appeal in the South. Over the 40 years leading up to Obama's first victory, Democrats managed to win the White House only when they put Southerners at the top of the ticket (Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton). Electoral College Advantage Obama has shown the party it can not only win but dominate the Electoral College with very little support in the South, outside states such as Virginia and Florida that are conducive to his coalition. But there's no guarantee that other Democrats will be able to draw on the same sources of support. African-Americans and young people did not turn out in force in 2010, which was one big reason Republicans enjoyed big victories at the congressional and state levels that year. \"I wouldn't say that other Democrats could automatically count on it,\" says David Bositis, a senior research associate at the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a think tank that studies minority affairs. But, Bositis notes, there are other prominent Democrats who should be able to appeal to the same sort of constituencies that propelled Obama to victory. \"Obama certainly helped mobilize many of these groups to vote,\" says Keeter, the Pew pollster. \"But there is no reason to think other Democratic candidates wouldn't be able to do well with them in the future.\"",

            "article_content": "We report on the morning after the election in Ohio, a pivotal swing state in the presidential election.  MELISSA BLOCK, HOST: This is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. I'm Melissa Block. ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: And I'm Robert Siegel. A key to President Obama's victory was a bloc of states in the Midwest. They're states he carried four years ago with large working class populations - Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin. Toss in Iowa and Pennsylvania and you have the core of the president's reelection effort. The strategy held in 2012 and why it held can be seen in the all important state of Ohio. NPR's Don Gonyea made Ohio his second home during this race and he sent this story. DON GONYEA, BYLINE: All along, the Obama campaign and Ohio Democrats maintained that they'd carry the state if they did their job. They got their reward just after 11:00 p.m. last night when the giant TV screens in a ballroom at a downtown Columbus hotel projected the state and the election going for Mr. Obama. (SOUNDBITE OF CROWD CHEERING) GONYEA: Here's how the Obama campaign scored a surprisingly big and early win in Ohio. First, way back four years ago, they knew they'd have to defend this turf again in 2012, so they maintained field offices in the state and outnumbered GOP offices by 3 to 1 this fall. They fine-tuned and upgraded their ground game and voter targeting even as Republicans also poured money and resources into their own newly beefed up get-out-the-vote effort. As votes were being cast yesterday, Lee Saunders, president of the AFSCME public employees union was in Columbus. LEE SAUNDERS: We have a better ground game. We have made over 2 million contacts here in this state. We have a ferocious ground game and our people are engaged. They're mobilizing. They're energizing our base. GONYEA: Union volunteers were working right up until the polls closed in Ohio yesterday. Same for Obama For America canvassers, sometimes even talking to people in cars who waved and stopped them to ask questions. This was around noon yesterday on the eastside of Columbus. A woman wanted to know if she had the proper ID as she drove to the polls. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: And this is his address here? UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: And his name, yes. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: And his name? That should be sufficient enough. I would go and try to use this and hold the ID back. And then, if you have to... GONYEA: The Obama campaign also took advantage of an ugly battle between unions and a couple of Republican governors, John Kasich in Ohio and Scott Walker in Wisconsin. The fight was over collective bargaining rights and goes back to 2011. But AFSCME's Lee Saunders says it was still a huge motivator in this election. SAUNDERS: And they know that if Mitt Romney is elected president then he's going to try to implement the kinds of things that Kasich and Scott Walker did. GONYEA: And through it all, the president's campaign kept its focus on the economy in Ohio where the unemployment rate had improved significantly since '08 and where the federal bailout of the auto industry is very popular. The Romney campaign gave Democrats a gift when it made a late play in Ohio, accusing Chrysler and GM of taking federal bailout money while planning to transfer Ohio auto jobs to China. (SOUNDBITE OF POLITICAL AD) UNIDENTIFIED MAN 2: Obama took GM and Chrysler into bankruptcy and sold Chrysler to Italians who are going to build Jeeps in China. GONYEA: Fact checkers ruled the ad's claims false and even auto executives denounced it, teeing things up for President Obama at Ohio campaign rallies. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: These car companies are putting a lot of effort to make great products, but also to, you know, make sure that everybody in America knows how committed they are to making cars here in America. And so, you don't scare off hard-working Americans just to scare up some votes. That's not what being president's all about. GONYEA: That message carried weight not just in Ohio, but in nearly every battleground state. Now, back to last night. UNIDENTIFIED GROUP: Four more years, four more years, four more years. GONYEA: Ohio's Democratic U.S. Senator Sherrod Brown, who won reelection, offered his instant interpretation of the results. SENATOR SHERROD BROWN: The middle class won again. GONYEA: Stephanie Peterson, who works for a health care provider, was excitedly taking it all in at the victory party, but she admitted it feels a lot different than four years ago. STEPHANIE PETERSON: Oh, hell, yes. It felt like a struggle. I felt his pressure. I really did. And I could scream it's so good, it's so good. I can't talk. Just let me enjoy my (unintelligible). GONYEA: But she didn't want to talk campaign strategy or why it worked. She said she was simply too excited to think about such things, then she let out another cheer. Don Gonyea, NPR News, Columbus.

            "article_content": "In Florida, the presidential race is still too close to call. Exit polls show President Obama with strong support among Black and Hispanic voters in the state. The party retained a Senate seat and picked up a few key congressional races.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Five hundred thirty-eight electoral votes were up for grabs on Election Day. President Obama has won, so far, 303 of them, a comfortable majority. Mitt Romney has 206. Twenty-nine are still unaccounted for - the electoral votes of Florida. Too close to call there. Less than a percentage point divides the candidates. But down the ballot, Democrats did well. The party retained a Senate seat and picked up a few key congressional races as well. NPR's Debbie Elliott reports. DEBBIE ELLIOTT, BYLINE: Florida's only statewide elected Democrat, Senator Bill Nelson held off a challenge from Republican congressman Connie Mack. In Orlando after his victory, Nelson called for unity. SENATOR BILL NELSON: We have to bring this country together. It's an extremely polarized, excessively partisan, ideologically rigid political environment. And the people are tired of that. ELLIOTT: But Mack, the GOP challenger, didn't sound conciliatory. REPRESENTATIVE CONNIE MACK: We may have lost the battle, but we haven't lost the war. ELLIOTT: In one of the hardest fought congressional battles here, Democrat Patrick Murphy, a political newcomer, is claiming a narrow victory over Republican incumbent Allen West. It was the most expensive House race in the country. West, a Tea Party freshman, isn't conceding. Democrats will also be sending former West Palm Beach Mayor Lois Frankel and Miami attorney Joe Garcia to Congress. The state party called it a good day to be a Democrat in Florida. Republicans, meanwhile, gathered in downtown Tampa for the state GOP's election night party - a party that never really got started. LENNY CURRY: Look, it's been a long night. ELLIOTT: Florida Republican chairman Lenny Curry addressed the crowd late in the evening, just after the news that President Obama had passed the electoral threshold for re-election. CURRY: Stick around as long as you'd like to. Pray. ELLIOTT: Disheartened Republicans, like Tampa businessman Dwight Lankford, slowly filed out of the hotel ballroom. DWIGHT LANKFORD: I think it's a great disappointment, and America took a wrong step tonight. ELLIOTT: As the tight Presidential race here indicates, both campaigns worked hard to turn out their voters. Long lines were the story for both early voting and on Election Day. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: (Chanting) Fired up. GROUP: (Chanting) Ready to vote. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Yeah, we're fired up. ELLIOTT: Outside an east Tampa precinct, Vietnam veteran Oliver Sutton waved Obama signs and rallied voters. GROUP: (Chanting) Four more years, four more years. ELLIOTT: He says he voted for President Obama in 2008, but this year was rejected at the polls because of questions about whether his voting rights had been restored after a felony conviction. It didn't deter his participation. OLIVER SUTTON: So what I did, I got 14 people to register to vote because they wouldn't let me vote. So, ha-ha. ELLIOTT: The economy was the dominant issue for most voters I spoke with in this mainly African-American working class neighborhood. Jewel McMillian is an unemployed, single mother of three who uses food stamps. She voted for President Obama. She says Romney doesn't understand her plight. JEWEL MCMILLIAN: I don't feel like he can relate to us, like, because he never had to struggle. ELLIOTT: Exit polls show President Obama with strong support among black and Hispanic voters in Florida. In a statement last night, Florida Senator Marco Rubio, a key surrogate for the Romney campaign, said Republicans need to work harder to communicate their beliefs to people in minority and immigrant communities.

            "article_content": "President Obama walks on stage with first lady Michelle Obama and daughters Sasha and Malia to deliver his victory speech on election night in Chicago.\n                \n                    \n                    Win McNamee/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption President Obama walks on stage with first lady Michelle Obama and daughters Sasha and Malia to deliver his victory speech on election night in Chicago. Americans elected Barack Obama to a second term Tuesday, with the president capturing or on the verge of winning all of the key states that had been at the center of his hard-fought campaign against Republican Mitt Romney. \"Whether I earned your vote or not, I have listened to you,\" Obama said early Wednesday at a speech before thousands of supporters in Chicago. \"I have learned from you. And you've made me a better president. \"And with your stories and your struggles, I return to the White House more determined and more inspired than ever about the work there is to do and the future that lies ahead,\" he said. The president's victory came surprisingly easily, as he won seven of the eight key battleground states and was ahead in the eighth, Florida. By holding the \"Midwest firewall\" \u2014 including Ohio, Wisconsin, Iowa and Michigan \u2014 the president handily defeated Romney. Obama congratulated the former Massachusetts governor for a well-fought battle and said he looks forward to sitting down with Romney to chart a path for moving the country forward. For his part, Romney conceded graciously. \"The nation, as you know, is at a critical point,\" Romney said to supporters at the Boston Convention Center. \"At a time like this, we can't risk partisan bickering and political posturing. Our leaders have to reach across the aisle to do the people's work, and we citizens also have to rise to the occasion.\" To wildly cheering crowds, he said, \"Like so many of you, [GOP vice presidential nominee] Paul [Ryan] and I have left everything on the field. I so wish, I so wish that I had been able to fulfill your hopes to lead the country in a new direction, but the nation chose another leader \u2014 and so Ann and I join with you to earnestly pray for him and for this great nation.\" Andrew Kohut, president of Pew Research Center, called it \"a topsy-turvy campaign from beginning to end. ... And it ended in a topsy-turvy way.\" Obama's victory comes despite the desultory state of the economy. The president lost ground over his 2008 victory in almost all demographic groups \u2014 whites, women and men, independents and even young people. But even those losses were not enough to knock him from the presidency, and part of that, according to Kohut, had to do with likability. Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney delivers his concession speech in Boston.\n                \n                    \n                    Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney delivers his concession speech in Boston. \"Fifty-three percent of people said they approved of how Obama handled his job,\" Kohut says. \"And a president with that kind of approval rating doesn't lose his job.\" Romney never recovered from two negative perceptions: that as head of Bain Capital, he cared more about profits than jobs; and his \"47 percent\" comment, when he suggested that nearly half of Americans see themselves as \"victims\" and expect the government to support them. It is not yet clear that the president will win the popular vote. Still, if trends continue, he is likely to. \"The most surprising thing was that the move toward the president was as distinctive as it was in the final days of the campaign,\" NPR Political Editor Ron Elving said. In recent days, polls showed Obama gaining momentum in battleground states. And if trends hold, it is possible that the president will win all eight of them. How The Vote Fell Full Coverage: Election Results In the final moments of the race, each candidate had advantages and disadvantages. Romney had a clear edge among men, especially white working-class men who make up much of the vote in battleground states such as Ohio and Wisconsin. He led among older voters, as well as independents, though by smaller margins than polls during the campaign indicated. Independents have voted Republican in every presidential race since 1952, with the exception of 1964 (Johnson vs. Goldwater) and 2008, when Obama swept them in a wave of hope and change. The president, however, fought back with overwhelming force. He won the female vote by large margins, even after women had cooled on him in the wake of his first, lackluster debate. Minorities \u2014 and especially Latinos, who factor large in swing states such as Florida, Colorado and Nevada \u2014 were firmly in the president's camp. One big trend in this campaign was the strong turnout among Latinos. Young people are also loyal to the president, although not quite as enthusiastically as in 2008. Undecided voters \u2014 whom Romney was counting on in swing states \u2014 did not break for the challenger as he had hoped, robbing him of a wavelike victory of the kind that benefited Ronald Reagan in 1980. The States That Mattered \u2014 And Didn't Supporters of Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney react to his defeat in Boston.\n                \n                    \n                    Emmanuel Dunand/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Supporters of Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney react to his defeat in Boston. Some of the predictions were spot on \u2014 that Ohio would be critical to an Obama win \u2014 but others collapsed with a loud thud. As predicted, the Midwest became the path to victory \u2014 in particular, holding the battleground states of Ohio, Wisconsin and Iowa. Obama also kept Pennsylvania in his column, even as Romney tried to expand the contested states with a flurry of campaigning there in recent days. Ohio: With its 18 electoral votes, Ohio was a must-win \u2014 and in this state, the president's bailout of the auto industry paid off. In the north, the auto industry bailout has driven the unemployment rate below the national average, and voters are rewarding the president. This more than compensated for voters in the southern part of the state, who are more socially and religiously conservative, and who have been hit hard economically, particularly in the coal industry. Wisconsin: With 10 electoral votes, Wisconsin leaned toward Obama from the start, although Romney briefly had some traction when he selected favorite son Ryan to be his running mate. That enthusiasm ebbed, and Wisconsin was one of the few states that did not give Romney a bump after the first presidential debate in October. Wisconsin has not voted for a Republican presidential candidate since 1984. Iowa: The state's six electoral votes completed the Midwest battleground strategy. In recent years, Iowa has voted for the Democratic presidential nominee, with the exception of George W. Bush in 2004. Obama benefited from the Latino vote and strong union support. Virginia: As it turned out, the president did not need Virginia's 13 electoral votes \u2014 but he won them anyway. Romney had polled ahead of Obama for the latter part of the campaign, but that support softened in the days before the election. The fight here was between fast-growing northern Virginia, a Washington, D.C. suburb with young urbanites who vote Democratic, versus much of the rest of the state: rural pro-gun conservative. Florida: With its 29 electoral votes, Florida is too close to call. But it doesn't matter. The state has three political identities: The south, including Miami, is diverse and, with the exception of an aging and shrinking Cuban population, leans heavily Democratic. The north, including the Panhandle, is socially and religiously conservative, with a strong military presence. People in the central part of the state \u2014 the Tampa-Orlando-Daytona Beach-I-4 corridor \u2014 are the definition of swing voters. And currently it appears they are swinging toward the president. Ups And Downs This campaign began with Americans distinctly tepid about their choices. Democrats said they were disappointed with President Obama's performance, smarting from the weak economy and frustrated that he seemed to have forgotten the poor in favor of the middle class. Republicans, too, were cool to their candidate. In fact, until springtime, evangelicals, who make up a large part of the Republican base, flirted with a number of candidates whose chief characteristic seemed to be that they were not Mitt Romney. But the last two months turned into a \"roller coaster ride,\" analyst Larry Sabato says. Each candidate made strategic errors. The first bit of excitement arrived in mid-September, in the form of a leaked tape of Romney saying that 47 percent of Americans \"who will vote for the president no matter what,\" are \"dependent upon government ... believe they are victims\" and do not pay taxes. Then, two weeks later, Obama stumbled throughout the first debate. The president looked like a boxer on the ropes taking blows from an aggressive Romney; he even failed to land a punch on Romney with an attack on Romney's 47-percent comment. This erased the president's yawning lead in the polls, and the horse race was on. \"What Romney accomplished in the first debate was that he stood up on a stage with President Obama and made it clear he was at least his equal,\" says Thomas Riehl, a senior vice president of YouGov, an online polling firm. \"You could imagine a Romney presidency and there wasn't much that was very threatening about that.\" But Romney's good fortunes were arrested by the weather. Hurricane Sandy served as a circuit breaker that cut into whatever momentum Romney had generated. \"This was kind of an October surprise,\" says Alan Abramowitz, a political scientist at Emory University. \"It gave the president an opportunity to act presidential, to act like a commander-in-chief.\" As Obama visited devastated parts of New Jersey and New York \u2014 as he received glowing praise from New Jersey's Republican governor, Chris Christie, and then an endorsement from New York's mayor, Michael Bloomberg \u2014 Romney was forced to the sidelines, at least temporarily. Those television shots of the president impressed voters: The Pew poll found that nearly 7 in 10 likely voters \u2014 and 63 percent of swing voters \u2014 approved of the way the president handled the disaster. In his acceptance speech, Obama seemed to look ahead to the battles he will surely face with a divided Congress and sometimes hostile House Republican leadership. Supporters cheer as President Obama delivers his victory speech in Chicago.\n                \n                    \n                    Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Supporters cheer as President Obama delivers his victory speech in Chicago. \"I believe we can seize this future together because we are not as divided as our politics suggest,\" the president said. \"We're not as cynical as the pundits believe. We are more than the sum of our individual ambitions, and we remain more than a collection of red states and blue states. We are and forever will be the United States of America, and together, with your help and God's grace, we will continue our journey forward and remind the world just why it is that we live in the greatest nation on Earth.\" Those words \u2014 that America is not divided into red states and blue states \u2014 were an echo of the hopeful sentiments that catapulted Obama to national prominence during his speech at the 2004 Democratic National Convention. Now the president is seasoned enough to know that the journey ahead will be jarring and tumultuous, even if he does speak with a new mandate from the American people.",

NPR reporters in Tampa, Fla., and the Columbus, Ohio, area talk with Morning Edition hosts about what people are talking about at the polls and possible challenges.  RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: This is MORNING EDITION from NPR News. I'm Renee Montagne. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: And I'm Steve Inskeep. Good morning. People have been joking for weeks that the candidates are actually running for president of Ohio. That's how vital the state is, but here's a reminder about the electoral map. It is at least theoretically possible for either candidate to lose Ohio and still reach 270 electoral votes by winning some combination of other states. Many of those combinations include Florida. MONTAGNE: And next, we'll hear from these two states, states that could decide the election - or delay the results for days to come. NPR's Debbie Elliot is with us in Tampa, Florida. NPR's Don Gonyea joins us from Columbus, Ohio, and welcome to you both. And Debbie, let's start with you. Tell us where you are exactly and what you're seeing. DEBBIE ELLIOT, BYLINE: I am in east Tampa at the Blythe Andrews, Jr. Public Library. This is in sort of a working class, mostly African-American neighborhood here and things have gone very smoothly so far here this morning. No lines, a bit contrast folks tell me to the way it was just a few days ago when early voting was going on. During early voting, people were lined up around the block. You might be able to hear folks chanting in the background, four more years. They've been hollering, fired up. There's a food truck selling - or actually giving away what they're calling Obama hot dogs, very much folks out here pushing for President Obama this morning. INSKEEP: Debbie, one quick question here. The Obama campaign has been counting on an 80 percent minority vote and not only that, a good turnout. Now, it's hard to go to any one place, any data point and know what the turnout is going to be, but do you sense enthusiasm where you are? ELLIOT: I do sense enthusiasm and in fact, one young woman told me she had come with a friend and thought this was her precinct. They told her, no, this is not your precinct, but what you can do is cast a provisional ballot here. The caveat being depending on how things go, that may or may not get counted. She said, no, thank you. And she told me afterwards, she's going to go take an extra hour, go to the correct precinct and make sure her vote counts. There's a real sense that anything can happen in Florida and that if they don't vote, they could be that one vote that makes a difference. At least that's the folks I've spoken with here today. And, you know, it was very similar earlier today when I was at a more affluent polling precinct at the Florida aquarium, where there were a good mix of both Republican and Democratic voters and everyone said, you know, it's worth waiting. They had an hour line there. It's worth waiting because we know this could come down to our vote making the difference. MONTAGNE: Let's bring Don Gonyea into the conversation. Don, you're there in Columbus, Ohio. Tell us where exactly you are and what you're seeing. DON GONYEA, BYLINE: I'm in east Columbus after spending a morning, the morning at a polling station. I actually went out with some AFL-CIO election volunteers and I've been walking with them for the last hour as they go door to door to door, knocking on union households, pre-identified union households, in this working class neighborhood, looking, scrounging, doing whatever it takes  to make sure anybody who can vote, who's eligible to vote actually gets to the polls, and has a way to get to the polls if necessary. INSKEEP: Have there been some cajoling going on, people saying I don't really have time for you today? GONYEA: You know, they - here's what happens. You knock on doors this time of day and most people just aren't home. But that's part of the hard work of a campaign, get-out-the-vote effort. You still have to go door to door and they have had positive encounters. The people who answered the doors said they had already voted. And they just go through a checklist to make sure that they voted the right way on Issue Number 2 or on down-ballot races. And then they encourage them to make sure everybody else in their household goes out and votes the same way. INSKEEP: Don, I know that the last poll showed President Obama a couple points up in Ohio, but it's such a vital state, people have been scouring the early voting records to see who has the tiniest, tiniest advantage. Do people have a sense there that every vote could matter, every single vote could matter in Ohio? GONYEA: ...celebrations tonight, but the last thing anybody wants to do - and again, I've been out with these, you know, these union members for the last hour. The last thing they want to do is at the end of the day, see that they lost a close one and wonder if there was one more door they could've knocked on and one more person that they could've had a face-to-face encounter with. So they wish every election were a blowout in their favor, but they know that this is Ohio and especially this year. It's all riding on what's happening here. But that's the sense from the ground. MONTAGNE: And this year, of course, we've heard a lot of talk of possible challenges to the results. We only have just about a minute here, but Debbie, what are you hearing down in Florida? ELLIOT: You know, I've heard from isolated incidents of voters being challenged, a few folks here talking about some confusion; they have felony records and there's some confusion. They thought their voting rights had been restored, but now they're finding out they're not. So there's a few isolated incidences of some problems, but it's too soon to say whether that's a widespread issue or not. MONTAGNE: And Don, briefly to you? GONYEA: Over a couple of hours, overwhelmingly the people I talked to said it was a pretty smooth experience, quicker than they thought. A couple of people said they had problems with the electronic voting machines, but they weren't overly concerned about it. I did talk to some folks who had to vote with provisional ballots and there was some nervousness there. Again, it all depends how close it is and how many provisional ballots there are. MONTAGNE: OK.

            "article_content": "As Americans go to the polls, one of the closest presidential races in years may be determined by a state in the Midwest and a hurricane named Sandy. After a campaign that has cost some $6 billion, the two candidates are in the same place they started: with President Obama a smidgen ahead of challenger Mitt Romney, so close that differences are in most cases statistically insignificant. Obama seems to have regained his footing after his sleepy performance in the first debate last month. According to a Pew Research Center poll over the weekend, Obama is leading Romney 48 percent to 45 percent among likely voters, thanks in part to how he handled the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy. In battleground states, too, the president appears to have the momentum. Supporters attend a Mitt Romney rally Monday in Columbus, Ohio.\n                \n                    \n                    Emmanuel Dunand /AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Supporters attend a Mitt Romney rally Monday in Columbus, Ohio. And yet, Pew Research Center President Andrew Kohut is bracing for a surprise. \"People are conflicted, especially swing voters and moderate voters,\" Kohut says. \"They look at Obama and say, 'He's underperformed.' And they look at Romney and say, 'We don't trust him and we don't know if he's for us.' \" In one way, the conflict is refreshing, says Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia's Center for Politics. The two candidates are \"presenting diametrically opposed visions, and that is interesting because often it isn't the case. You have two very different visions on the economy, on social issues, on some aspects of foreign policy.\" One thing everyone agrees on: The fate of the presidency will be determined by a handful of battleground states, and perhaps only one: Ohio. The president has the advantage because there are several routes that would lead him to the 270 electoral college votes he needs to win, says Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion, which conducts polls for NBC and the Wall Street Journal. Romney, the former Massachusetts governor, starts from a weaker position in the projected electoral vote count and must win more battleground states. \"So, in a sense, Romney is playing more for an inside straight,\" Miringoff says. The Battleground States Florida: 29 electoral votes; Real Clear Politics average, Romney up 1.5 percentage points. Florida is a must-win for Romney. The state has three political identities: The south, including Miami, is diverse and, with the exception of an aging and shrinking Cuban population, leans heavily Democratic. The north, including the Panhandle, is socially and religiously conservative, with a strong military presence. People in the central part of the state \u2014 the Tampa-Orlando-Daytona Beach-I-4 corridor \u2014 are the definition of swing voters. Ohio: 18 electoral votes; Real Clear Politics average, Obama up by 2.9 percentage points. Ohio may be in 2012 what Florida was in 2000 \u2014 the most contested of the states. Here we have two strains of working-class voters with opposite motivations. In the north, the auto industry bailout has driven the unemployment rate below the national average, and voters are rewarding the president. The southern part of the state is more socially and religiously conservative; it has been hard-hit economically, particularly the coal industry, and workers lean Republican. Watch for a fight over ballots in this state. Ohio law requires a recount if one candidate wins by a quarter of 1 percent or less, which is a possibility. Moreover, more than 200,000 voters are expected to cast provisional ballots because they don't have a photo ID or for other reasons, and those votes would not be counted until Nov. 16. Virginia: 13 electoral votes; Real Clear Politics average, Obama up by 0.3 percentage points. The fight here is between fast-growing northern Virginia, a suburb of Washington, D.C., with its young urbanites who vote Democratic, versus the rest of the state: rural pro-gun conservatives. Obama won this historically Republican state in 2008, but Republicans came roaring back in subsequent races. Virginia is critical to a Romney win. Wisconsin: 10 electoral votes; Real Clear Politics average, Obama up by 4.2 percentage points. Romney wants to make this a battleground state, but it is an uphill fight. Wisconsin has not voted for a Republican presidential candidate since 1984. Romney briefly had some traction when he selected a favorite son, Paul Ryan, to be his running mate. However, that enthusiasm has ebbed, and Wisconsin was one of the few states that did not give Romney a bump after the first presidential debate in October. Colorado: 9 electoral votes; Real Clear Politics average, Obama up by 1.5 percentage points. Obama carried Colorado by 9 percentage points in 2008, but in the preceding three elections, the state went red. Three ingredients make Colorado a swing state. The urban areas of Denver and Boulder are typically Democratic. The growing Latino population favors Obama. But the Colorado Springs area is considered the mecca for conservative evangelicals. Iowa: 6 electoral votes; Real Clear Politics average, Obama up by 2.4 percentage points. Since 1998, Iowa has voted for the Democrat, with the exception of George W. Bush in 2004. Obama can count on its growing Latino vote and strong unions for support. But Iowa has turned more conservative of late and elected Republican Terry Branstad as governor in 2010. New Hampshire: 4 electoral votes; Real Clear Politics average, Obama up by 2 percentage points. Ages ago, New Hampshire was a reliably red state, but it has turned decidedly purple in recent years. The White House has paid close attention to the state, sending Vice President Joe Biden there several times. But Romney has a foothold there, as well as a vacation house; the voters have an independent streak and generally dislike government intrusion \u2014 a sentiment that Romney has capitalized on. Ups And Downs If the presidential race has people on pins and needles, it wasn't that way six months ago. Democrats said they were disappointed with Obama's performance, smarting from the desultory economy, and frustrated that he seemed to have forgotten the poor in favor of the middle class. Republicans, too, were tepid about their candidate. In fact, until springtime, evangelicals, who make up a large part of the Republican base, flirted with a number of candidates whose chief characteristic seemed to be that they were not Mitt Romney. But the past two months have turned into a \"roller coaster ride,\" Sabato says. Each candidate made strategic errors. Supporters listen to President Obama at a campaign rally Monday in Columbus, Ohio.\n                \n                    \n                    Jewel Samad/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Supporters listen to President Obama at a campaign rally Monday in Columbus, Ohio. The first bit of excitement arrived in mid-September, in the form of a leaked tape of Romney saying that 47 percent of Americans \"will vote for the president no matter what,\" are \"dependent upon government, who believe they are victims\" and do not pay taxes. But then, two weeks later, Obama stumbled throughout the first debate. The president looked like a boxer on the ropes taking blows from an aggressive Romney; he even failed to land a punch on Romney with an attack on Romney's 47 percent comment. This erased the president's yawning lead in the polls, and we had a horse race. \"Before the first debate, President Obama was on his way to a landslide re-election victory,\" says Thomas Riehl, a senior vice president of YouGov, an online polling firm. But after the debate, not only were Obama supporters deflated, but independents and undecided voters took a hard look at Romney \u2014 and liked what they saw. \"What Romney accomplished in the first debate was that he stood up on a stage with President Obama and made it clear he was at least his equal,\" Riehl says. \"You could imagine a Romney presidency, and there wasn't much that was very threatening about that.\" For the first time, more people told pollsters they would vote for Romney and not just against Obama. According to polls by Pew Research, 36 percent of likely voters said they had a better opinion of Romney after the debate, and his favorability rating shot up to 50 percent \u2014 about the same as the president. But Romney's good fortunes were arrested by the weather. Hurricane Sandy served as a circuit breaker that cut into whatever momentum Romney had generated. \"This was kind of an October surprise,\" says Alan Abramowitz, a political scientist at Emory University. \"It gave the president an opportunity to act presidential, to act like a commander in chief.\" As Obama visited devastated parts of New Jersey and New York \u2014 as he received glowing praise from New Jersey Republican Gov. Chris Christie, and then an endorsement from New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg \u2014 Romney was forced to the sidelines, at least temporarily. Those television shots of the president impressed voters: The Pew poll found that nearly seven in 10 likely voters \u2014 and 63 percent of swing voters \u2014 approved of the way the president handled the disaster. How The Vote Falls In the final moments of the race, each candidate has advantages and disadvantages that could tip the scale. Romney has a clear edge among men, especially white working-class men who make up much of the vote in battleground states such as Ohio and Wisconsin. He's leading among older voters \u2014 who are bigger in number and more reliable than the young people, who overwhelmingly support the president. Independents are expected to break Republican, as they have in every presidential race since 1952, with the exception of 1964 and 2008, when Obama swept them in a wave of hope and change. Finally, Romney has generated great enthusiasm among Republicans: Romney supporters are more engaged in the contest, and say they are more likely to vote, than Obama supporters. This could mean a larger turnout for Romney on Tuesday night. The president, however, has plenty of arrows in his quiver. As to enthusiasm, many more voters strongly support Obama than Romney \u2014 an indicator that has predicted the popular vote winner in nine of the past 12 elections, says Kohut. Moreover, after cooling to the president last month, female voters have come roaring back to the president's side. Minorities \u2014 and especially Latinos, who factor large in swing states such as Florida, Colorado and Nevada \u2014 are firmly in the president's camp, as are young people. Undecided voters remain a big question mark. Republicans hope that 2012 will look like 1980, when undecideds moved en masse in Ronald Reagan's direction. \"But from what we've seen this time around, there isn't that big chunk of undecided voters almost anywhere to be able to make that massive move at the end,\" says Dennis Goldford, a political scientist at Drake University. \"On the other hand, if the election is really close, even a feather on the scale can make a difference.\" Close Elections 'The New Normal' Abramowitz at Emory University has developed a model for predicting elections, which he calls the \"time for change\" model. He looks at presidential approval ratings and GDP in June, as well as incumbency. Typically, he says, \"voters are reluctant to change parties after only one term. When you get to second term or later, they're more willing to make that change.\" Using this model, Obama should be poised to win the popular vote by 1 percent, Abramowitz says. But Abramowitz has noticed another development of late: partisanship. \"The advantage of incumbency has gotten smaller, because voters are less willing to cross party lines now,\" he says. \"So when there's a Democratic president like now, Republicans are less willing to cross party lines to vote for him. As a result, the advantage is about half what it used to be.\" Abramowitz and others are bracing for a nightmare scenario, similar to 2000, when George W. Bush won the electoral vote and Al Gore won the popular vote. That's a real possibility, says Goldford at Drake, particularly since Hurricane Sandy could suppress the popular vote in New York and New Jersey, even as these states go blue. If that happens, Goldford says, \"this past four years will seem like a picnic compared to the next four years.\" He pauses, remembering the chaos of 2000, the hanging chads and Supreme Court decision. \"One thing I hope more than anything else,\" he says, \"is that this is actually over on Tuesday night.\" It may be a vain hope. Lawyers representing both sides are in place, ready to litigate and demand recounts in every close state.",

            "article_content": "The U.S. economy remains in a gray area, so it's no wonder that the presidential race is essentially tied. Gross domestic product grew at a 2 percent annual rate between June and September, according to figures out Friday. The White House says this means the economy has been growing for 13 straight quarters. \"This report provides further evidence that the economy is moving in the right direction,\" Alan Krueger, head of President Obama's Council of Economic Advisers, said in a statement. But the economy isn't performing nearly well enough, Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney said in a speech in Ames, Iowa, after the report came out. \"President Obama frequently reminds us that he inherited a troubled economy. But a troubled economy is not all that he inherited. He also inherited the greatest nation in the history of the Earth,\" Romney said. \"What he did with what he inherited made the problem worse.\" The final jobs report before the election will be released next Friday. The September report saw the unemployment rate fall below 8 percent for the first time in nearly four years \u2014 but just barely, to 7.8 percent. That's how most of the economic data are looking now. Things are improving, but are nowhere near where an incumbent president would like them to be. \"I think the data are consistent with expectations,\" says Phillip Swagel, a public policy professor at the University of Maryland, who worked in the Treasury Department under President George W. Bush. \"The economy is growing, but at a modest pace, with only modest job creation and stagnant incomes for American families,\" Swagel says. \"Not recession, but not satisfactory.\" On the other hand, sustained if not tremendous growth makes it more difficult for a challenger like Romney to convince the voting public that a change in course is required. Recent polling shows Romney beating Obama in terms of whom voters would prefer to see managing the U.S. economy. In a Washington Post-ABC News poll released Thursday, 53 percent of likely voters said they trusted Romney more on the economy, compared with 43 percent who favored Obama. But an Associated Press-GfK poll out Friday showed a much narrower advantage for Romney on economic issues: 47 percent, compared with 45 percent for Obama. That poll also pointed to some economic optimism among voters, with nearly 60 percent saying they expect to see things get better over the coming year. \"Maybe it's direction that matters,\" says Thomas Hyclak, an economist at Lehigh University in Pennsylvania. \"If things are bad and getting better, it doesn't hurt the incumbent as much,\" he says. \"If things are bad and getting worse, it really does affect the chances for the incumbent.\" There's also some evidence to suggest that people's perceptions of the state of the economy is skewed by their partisan inclinations. That is, voters who support Obama are more likely to see the economy as improving than Republicans are. \"There's a huge partisan component to views about the economy,\" says Shanto Iyengar, a political scientist at Stanford University. A recent Purple Strategies poll found that 37 percent of voters in 12 swing states believe the economy is getting better. Ninety-four percent of those voters say they support Obama, compared with just 5 percent of those who believe the economy is getting worse. The economy is about where most economists would expect it to be at this point, Hyclak says. History suggests that a recession triggered by a collapse in the housing market and a financial crisis is bound to lead to a sluggish recovery with slow job growth. Yet the nation's economic growth remains at risk. The looming fiscal cliff has shaved 0.6 percent off of GDP growth this year and cost a million jobs, according to a report from the National Association of Manufacturers. And the mixed corporate earnings season has caused the stock market to zig and zag. Economists are predicting that the nation's financial picture will brighten over the next couple of years. The research firm Moody's Analytics predicts GDP growth will approach 4 percent in 2014, with unemployment coming down. And the latest forecast from the International Monetary Fund predicts annual growth of about 3 percent in the U.S. economy over the next four years, which would be much better than in other rich nations. Happy days might not be here again, but consumers are opening their wallets. Back-to-school spending was up this year, while holiday spending is expected to grow modestly. Recent GDP growth was driven by consumer spending and improvements in the housing market. A survey released Friday showed the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan consumer sentiment index at its most optimistic reading since September 2007. It's possible that people who do have jobs are starting to feel a little less uncertain than they were a couple of years back, suggests Hyclak, the Lehigh economist. Timing matters. The last one-term president, George H.W. Bush, lost his re-election bid in 1992 \u2014 the \"it's the economy, stupid,\" election \u2014 even though the economy was growing at a much faster clip than it is today. GDP grew by 3.8 percent in the summer of 1992 and was growing even faster by the time the election was held. \"Yet Americans did not feel as if the economy was recovering,\" Princeton University historian Sean Wilentz writes in his book The Age of Reagan. \"Rather, they thought Bush was out of touch with the suffering and anxieties of middle- and working-class citizens.\" Obama doesn't face those same image problems. Polls have consistently shown that Americans believe the president has a good feel for the hard times they're going through. Still, they're not convinced he's done enough to make things better. At least, a firm majority isn't convinced. And it may be too late at this point to change many minds. \"It will take a large dose of very good news or very bad news to affect the election at this late date,\" says John Sides, a political scientist at George Washington University. \"To me, the [new] GDP numbers are neither.\"",

For all the attention paid to women in this race, there's another gender gap \u2014 with white men. The Republican ticket of Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan campaigned in northeastern Florida on Friday, where thousands of men had descended on Daytona Beach for the annual motorcycle festival Biketoberfest. A bunch of them were at Willie's Tropical Tattoo smoking cigarettes, drinking beer and listening to music. Gary Biser goes by the name \"Moose.\" Stickers on his bike helmet say, \"Life's too short to ride with ugly women,\" \"No bar too far,\" and other things that can't be printed. He says he is resigned to voting for Mitt Romney. \"I don't have anybody else to choose for, but he's gonna be my man,\" Biser says. Biser works in the coal mines of rural Maryland. He says these past four years have been a disaster. \"Well, they've dropped our wages down, they've dropped our medical, everything else. Price of gas and everything's up. Shouldn't be that way,\" Biser says. In this crowd, which is largely white men, there's a lot of enthusiasm for Republican ideas. People are less excited about the Republican nominee. \"I wish the Republican Party would quit finding multibillionaires to run just so they could get their message across,\" says Jerry Willard, who recently retired here in Florida. Whatever his feelings about Romney, Willard says he hates that Democrats are trying to cut more deeply into wealthy people's incomes. \"Have you ever been hired by somebody that was broke? Have you ever been hired by somebody that was poor? Have you ever been hired by someone that was on welfare or food stamps?\" he asks. \"I don't think I ever have. I don't think I'm ever gonna get there. So the question is: Who the heck hires us? People with money.\" There's no question who's going to win the votes in this crowd. In the last election, Barack Obama carried only 41 percent of white men, according to exit polls. And that was a high water mark for Democrats. John Kerry got 37 percent of the white male vote; Al Gore took only 36 percent. So the important question is how big a margin among white men Romney will get this year. There's a lot of pressure to do better than Republicans have done before, since minority groups are booming. \"We do spend a lot of time in Florida talking about the growing Hispanic population and the growing black population of voters, but as a practical matter, there still are more white voters in Florida than there are other groups,\" says Aubrey Jewett, a political scientist at the University of Central Florida in Orlando. Neither presidential candidate is a natural fit with this crowd, but they try. Obama welcomed NASCAR drivers to the White House back in April. \"These are some outstanding men. And it's true about the whole NASCAR organization,\" Obama said. Romney made two rained-out attempts to see a race. Eventually he campaigned at the NASCAR Technical Institute in North Carolina. \"I only dreamed of cars like that. To have my name on a car like that is just too much,\" Romney said. Perhaps it's no coincidence then that both men at the bottom of the ticket, Joe Biden and Paul Ryan, specialize in relating to working-class guys. Even at Biketoberfest, this group is not a monolith. In the sea of sleeveless black T-shirts, tattoos and bandanas, one Obama supporter popped his head up. \"I like when they went after him for his birth certificate while he was going after bin Laden,\" says Ormond Beach, Fla., resident Bobby Sayward. \"It's like this guy went right behind everybody's back and he got the job done. Why people don't vote for him is going to be an amazing thing to me.\" In this sea of white men, the Obama voter is a true minority.",

President Obama and Republican rival Mitt Romney both barnstormed Ohio this week, holding rallies just miles apart in the state's northwest. Obama's event was smack in the middle of Wood County, with Romney's just north. The county may have a population of only 125,000, but it has an outsized importance in presidential elections. \"Since 1960, [Wood County] has predicted every election except for one,\" says Wood County GOP Chairman Matt Reger. \"I think that it is a microcosm of Ohio, which in some parts is a microcosm of the United States.\" Wood County has an even distribution of Democrats and Republicans who are registered, Reger says, though Republicans have a light advantage. It also has a large degree of independents \u2014 almost 60,000 \u2014 which is more than the number of registered Democrats and Republicans there combined. This makes the county as important in the state as Ohio is nationally, meaning as Wood County goes, so does Ohio. This is especially critical for Mitt Romney, because no Republican has ever won the White House without also winning Ohio. Recent polls show Obama pulling ahead of Romney in Ohio, but NPR's Ari Shapiro, who has traveled with both campaigns, tells weekends on All Things Considered host Guy Raz that the Romney campaign is still fighting hard and is not counting out the state just yet. \"They'd be foolish not to be concerned,\" Shapiro says. \"[But] clearly they are still campaigning really hard there. There are paths to victory without Ohio, but far fewer of them.\" So How Will They Vote? As Reger says, it's sometimes hard to predict how the presidential vote will go in Wood County, which for the past 50 years has only gotten it wrong once, in 1976. Like Ohio, Wood County's largest industry is agriculture. At a farmer's market in the town of Perrysburg, Dennis Dickey had some harsh words for the president. \"Obama's done nothing about anything,\" he said. \"The economy still sucks, unemployment's still bad, [and] he shoved health care down everybody's throat that didn't want it.\" Retired business owner Chuck Cassis was also critical of Obama.\"Yes, I did make my own business,\" Cassis said. \"And if he was talking about the roads, then it's my taxes paid for those, too.\" In nearby Luckey, just a dozen miles away, there was support in the other direction. \"When I was laid off, [Obama] kept the unemployment coming so that I didn't lose everything,\" said Sharon Williams, a retired legal secretary. Roxanne Rideout said she liked the way Obama handled himself under pressure: \"He's not a hot head, especially with things that happen abroad.\" That's part of what makes Wood County so unpredictable \u2014 all kinds of political views in all kinds of places. Obama's Edge Alec MacGillis, a senior editor with The New Republic, has been reporting extensively on Ohio over the past few months. He says part of Obama's polling advantage there might be explained by attack ads. \"A lot of these ads that ran in Ohio were not seen all that much elsewhere,\" MacGillis tells NPR's Raz. \"They were very well targeted.\" MacGillis says the other advantage Obama has had in Ohio is due to Romney's perception among white, working class voters. \"As much as Obama was not well suited to Ohio,\" he says, \"Romney was really not suited to Ohio because of this profile as ... 'the guy who fires you.' \" One thing MacGillis thinks people are getting wrong about Romney is the notion that he should be doing better because the economy is so rough. In the case of Ohio, it is simply not the case. \"Unemployment in Ohio is down to 7 percent from well above 10 percent,\" he says. \"The auto bailout played a huge part in this, [and] there's also the shale gas boom in Ohio which has really helped the state.\" Wood County's economy is doing better as well, but Reger, the GOP chairman, attributes that to policies put in place by local Republicans. \"The policies are the policies Mitt Romney is advocating,\" he says. \"So, on a national level, that's the kind of policies we want.\" In Wood County, 13 of the 15 local elected officials are Republicans.",

            "article_content": "The Obama administration recently filed a complaint against China with the World Trade Organization. Meanwhile the two campaigns are having an ad war in Ohio over Chinese trade. Part of the reason is that Ohio's manufacturing industry \u2014 especially for autos \u2014 is firing on all cylinders.  ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: According to Bloomberg, President Obama and Mitt Romney have aired nearly 30,000 TV spots addressing the issue of trade with China, and that's just in the past month. Many of those ads aired in Ohio where both candidates are spending a lot of time. NPR's Sonari Glinton explains the Ohio-China nexus. SONARI GLINTON, BYLINE: If there's a boogeyman in the Ohio presidential sweepstakes, it's China. (SOUNDBITE OF AD) UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: China is stealing American ideas and technology, everything from computers to fighter jets. Seven times, Obama could have taken action. Seven times, he said no. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: Mitt Romney, tough on China? Romney's companies were called pioneers in shipping U.S. manufacturing jobs overseas. He invested in firms that specialized in relocating jobs to low-wage countries like China. GLINTON: Ohio is third only to California and Texas when it comes to manufacturing. The state produces cars, steel, washing machines, even footballs. The Obama administration in the last several months filed complaints with the World Trade Organization against China. The complaint involved two of Ohio's biggest exports: car parts and tires. When visiting Ohio, both sides used their stump speeches to hammer hard against that country. Here's Mitt Romney from earlier this week. MITT ROMNEY: I understand that when we trade and when other nations trade on a fair basis, we will compete, we will win, we'll raise wages here, we'll create jobs. But I also understand that when people cheat, that kills jobs. China has cheated. I will not allow that to continue. GLINTON: And the president. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: When you hear his newfound outrage, when you see those ads he's running promising to get tough on China, you know, it's sort of like the fox standing up and saying, you know, we need to keep the chicken coops more secure. GLINTON: Larry Anderson is from Franklin County, right outside of Columbus. LARRY ANDERSON: It's a struggle today for young people to find a good employment, unless you want to work minimum wage. And a lot of that, even minimum wage jobs are hard to find. GLINTON: Anderson says, Chinese trade is probably the most important issue in this election. ANDERSON: The United States has a lot of stuff that is made in China that can be made here in this country and create jobs. GLINTON: Jobs and new ones have been created in Ohio. Much of the auto industry that's here is under 30 years old. Out among the soybeans and cornfields is Jefferson Industries Corporation. They make auto body parts for Honda. Hassan Saadat says the key for his company is that everything is very, very fast. HASSAN SAADAT: So what we make at 6:00 in the morning, by noontime is being shipped to Honda. Then by 4:00 in the afternoon, Honda is using it in their operation. GLINTON: So this is going to be in a car tomorrow. SAADAT: It is going to be in a car this evening. Absolutely. That's how our practice goes. GLINTON: This is manufacturing in Ohio. Much of it is very new and global. And perhaps because of this, many Ohioans still are very wary of the permanence of manufacturing. BRAD WHITEHEAD: Over the course of several decades, Ohio and northeast Ohio experienced a lot of pain in the manufacturing sector as we shed tens of thousands of jobs. Many of those went overseas. GLINTON: Brad Whitehead is with Fund Our Economic Future, a nonprofit that tries to stimulate economic development. He says there's been a lot of new growth in manufacturing and foreign investment. WHITEHEAD: And so it's understandable if people are feeling like these early gains are promising, but that they may be vulnerable. GLINTON: This feeling of vulnerability is what both candidates are looking to tap, says Paul Beck, a political scientist at the Ohio State University, especially, he says, among white working class voters who've seen jobs go away. PAUL BECK: And they recognize that those days are gone and they, I think, are skeptical about whether any politicians are going to solve those problems. But they're especially skeptical, I think, about a Romney or an Obama. GLINTON: Beck says that skepticism will keep many undecided for a while. That means more ads and more talks of China.

            "article_content": "Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney's swing through Ohio took him from the suburbs of Columbus through parched cornfields and pumpkin patches to industrial corridors near Cleveland and Toledo. Romney says his policies will make things better for struggling Americans.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Mitt Romney's released a new ad - low-tech and simple, the jacket is off, no tie, as he looks at the camera and says he feels compassion for struggling Americans. (SOUNDBITE OF TV AD) INSKEEP: NPR's Debbie Elliott spent yesterday following Romney's bus tour through Ohio where he sounded similar themes. DEBBIE ELLIOTT, BYLINE: Romney is making the case that he understands the plight of the middle class. In an interview with NBC last night, he made a rare defense of his Massachusetts health care law, saying he doesn't think there's anything that shows more empathy.  Earlier, in a packed gymnasium at Westerville South High School, outside Columbus, Romney told stories about people struggling without work and touted his experience as the best shot at a turnaround. : I know what it takes to get this economy going again. I care about the people of America. And the difference between me and President Obama is I know what to do and I will do what it takes to get this economy going. ELLIOTT: On stage near his giant portable debt clock, Romney said if President Obama is reelected, the national debt could grow to almost $20 trillion and warned not to expect huge tax cuts from a Romney administration because of fewer deductions and closed loopholes. Twenty-six-year-old Julie Thompson came to see Romney for the first time, and says she found him more personable than he comes off on TV. JULIE THOMPSON: I thought he was a lot more well-spoken and a lot more put together than I thought he would ever be. Like, he just seemed so genuine and so nice. ELLIOTT: Romney has been working to make a connection with the middle-of-the-road voters who could make the difference in Ohio. Yesterday, he emphasized the state's manufacturing base, a base hit hard by the recession. TIM SELHORST: It's been tough. It's been a tough set of years for our company. ELLIOTT: Tim Selhorst is the president and CEO of American Spring Wire and hosted Romney at the company's plant at Bedford Heights yesterday. SELHORST: We believe that we can compete with anybody on earth as wire makers, don't we? (APPLAUSE) SELHORST: What we need is a little better leadership. We need a better environment. ELLIOTT: Romney, sitting among a panel of manufacturers, told them they've been losing business because of unfair competition from overseas. : One of the nations that has cheated over the years has been China. They've artificially held down the value of their currency. And by doing that, the prices of their products are artificially low. And when their prices are low and then they compete with our manufacturers, our guys go out of business and people lose jobs. ELLIOTT: Romney says he'll label China a currency manipulator. But the China issue is complicated territory. President Obama has attacked Romney for complaining the country's trade practices when he profited from investments there. In Bedford Heights, a woman in the audience posed this dilemma. CHRISSY SPARROW: My name is Chrissy Sparrow and I'm a stay-at-home mom. And several years ago I stumbled on an idea to create a product. And I've been able to create that product and actually manufacture the product, but in order for me to do so, I had to go to China. And I have been so embarrassed to even admit that I had to go there. ELLIOTT: What is an entrepreneur supposed to do, she asked? Later, in Toledo, Romney sounded the same theme: a harder line on China. : I'm going to crack down on China. They should not steal our jobs unfairly. That can't continue. ELLIOTT: As he rallied in the Toledo Civic Center, the adjacent hotel was host to an international business expo that brought mostly Chinese business people to the city in hopes of luring investment to the region.

            "article_content": "Republican vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan launched a bus tour of the battleground state of Ohio Monday. Mitt Romney joins Ryan Tuesday. The two are meeting up as questions are being raised about the campaign's use of Ryan, who was expected to add policy heft to the ticket.  DAVID GREENE, HOST: If you live in Ohio, you probably feel like this national presidential campaign is focused exclusively on one state - yours. Certainly may feel that way this week. President Obama has released a new TV ad in Ohio and he'll be campaigning in the key battleground state later in the week. Today, Republican Mitt Romney joins up with his running mate, Paul Ryan, on a bus tour aimed at Ohio's working class voters. This bus trip comes as Republican insiders are asking some questions about Ryan's role in the campaign. Here's NPR's Debbie Elliott. DEBBIE ELLIOTT, BYLINE: At least one Ohio voter appears ready for the Romney-Ryan campaign to step it up a notch. DAN ERMELER: We need backbone in the Republican Party. We have not have backbone in the Republican Party for many a years. ELLIOTT: Dan Ermeler stepped up to the mic during a town hall in Lima, Ohio yesterday, where Paul Ryan kicked off the bus tour. Ryan acknowledged Ermeler's frustration REPRESENTATIVE PAUL RYAN: I couldn't agree with your more. (APPLAUSE) ELLIOTT: Many conservatives expected Ryan to be the backbone when Mitt Romney selected him as a running mate, certainly on social issues and fiscal policy. On the stump, he does spell out the numbers, even supplementing with charts and graphs at the Lima gathering. He told Ermeler he was talking about cutting the deficit long before it was cool. RYAN: When Mitt Romney asked me to join the ticket, he said this to me. He said, number one, you share my values. Number two, you have shown you have the gumption and guts to reform this in Congress and to get this done. That's the kind of experience I need, 'cause we have to save America in 2013. Join me and let's do that. You know what I said to him? I said let's get this done. And so... (APPLAUSE) ELLIOTT: But as Election Day draws closer and polls show Obama with a slight edge in hard-fought Ohio, some Republicans question whether the ticket is getting it done. One of them is Governor Scott Walker of Wisconsin, Ryan's home state. In a Milwaukee radio interview Friday, he talked about his high expectations for what Ryan would bring to the campaign - expectations that have not been met. GOVERNOR SCOTT WALKER REPUBLICAN, WISCONSIN: I could sense the enthusiasm, the excitement, the adrenaline that Mitt Romney had - not just Paul Ryan had - about this ticket and about being bold and exciting. I haven't seen that as much lately and I think they need to get back there if they're going to win the election. People want bold leadership. ELLIOTT: There's always this kind of Monday Morning quarterbacking when campaigns are so close, says political scientist John Green, director of the Bliss Institute at the University of Akron. He says Ryan has been a good team player. JOHN GREEN: One of the most important things for a vice presidential nominee is to not cause any trouble for the ticket, as a whole; to not create a distraction or to overshadow the nominee. ELLIOTT: Voters in Lima seemed to understand that role. Terrence Edgett says Congressman Ryan is hitting just the right tone. TERRENCE EDGETT: A lot more so than the running mate of John McCain, you know? That was his big downfall. ELLIOTT: Ryan has not sparked the attention that Sarah Palin did four years ago. And that makes him asset in the eyes of JoLynn Delgado, a church secretary who campaigns, door to door, for the Romney-Ryan campaign. JOLYNN DELGADO: They don't want him to look better than the main dude. So yeah, they're going to tamp him down a little bit. (LAUGHTER) DELGADO: Yeah, don't want him to overshadow anybody. So, you know, hopefully his time will come in eight years. ELLIOTT: Ryan has not shied away from one signature issue: changing Medicare, a position that drew boos from his AARP audience last week. But for Robin Kantner of New Knoxville, Ohio, the most important thing he brings to the GOP ticket is his background. ROBIN KANTNER: He's the one that's not super rich and he lives in a nice, normal American town. And he talks about issues that are important for the ordinary person. ELLIOTT: Kantner says that makes for a nice balance to Mitt Romney. The two are expected to campaign together in Ohio today. Debbie Elliott, NPR News, Cincinnati.

            "article_content": "Anytime a candidate calls an unexpected press conference in the evening, you know it's not good news. We look at the latest news and political fall out from the release of Mitt Romney's remarks at a private fundraiser. The comments were made in May and the recording was released by Mother Jones magazine.  AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Audie Cornish. ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: I'm Robert Siegel. And we begin this hour in damage control mode with Mitt Romney. He spent the day and part of last night explaining controversial comments he made at a private fundraiser in May, those comments we secretly recorded and released yesterday. On the tape, Romney says that 47 percent of Americans don't pay taxes and consider themselves entitled to handouts from the government. NPR's national political correspondent Mara Liasson on the politics of the statement and the backlash it's caused. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Today, Romney went to the friendly turf of Fox News for a one-on-one interview with host Neil Cavuto, where he tried to explain his remarks at the fundraiser. (SOUNDBITE OF TV INTERVIEW) MITT ROMNEY: I recognize that that those people who are not paying income tax are going to say, gosh, this provision of - that Mitt keeps talking about, lowering income taxes, that's not going to be real attractive to them. And those that are dependent upon on government and those that think government's job is to redistribute, I'm not going to get them. I know there's a divide in the country about that view. LIASSON: But late last night in a hastily called press conference, Romney did admit he could have expressed himself at that fundraiser more artfully. (SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE) ROMNEY: It's not elegantly stated, let me put it that way. I'm speaking off the cuff in response to a question. And I'm sure I could state it more clearly and in a more effective way than I did in a setting like that. LIASSON: The Obama campaign sees the videotape released by Mother Jones magazine as the kind of gaffe that can move votes. Here's Obama surrogate Ted Strickland, the former governor of Ohio, on CNN. (SOUNDBITE OF TV INTERVIEW) TED STRICKLAND: You know, he said, I spoke inelegantly. No. He spoke from his heart, and that's what troubles me. If you listen to that tape, you understand that this man is speaking in the most casual, relaxed way with rich fat cats about a large portion of the American population that he has zero respect for. LIASSON: In 2008, when candidate Obama in a similar secretly filmed fundraiser video described bitter rural voters who cling to religion and guns, Republicans said he had revealed his true self - elitist and condescending. The new Romney video is potentially damaging because it too seems to reveal the real Romney, explaining to donors why he can never convince Obama voters to, quote, \"take personal responsibility and care for their lives.\" (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO) ROMNEY: There are 47 percent who are with him, who are dependent upon government, who believe that they are victims, who believe the government has a responsibility to care for them, who believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you name it. That that's an entitlement. And the government should give it to them. LIASSON: And Romney states: (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO) ROMNEY: These are people who pay no income tax. LIASSON: This is a familiar conservative argument, that income tax and not the federal payroll tax is the dividing line between the makers and the takers and that government benefits create a culture of dependency. Romney didn't acknowledged that many of the voters in the Republican coalition, including elderly and white working-class people, fit his description of the 47 percent. The Obama campaign wasted no time. They were up with a Web video by midday showing people watching the Romney tape on iPads and then reacting. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO) UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Wow. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: I actually felt sick to my stomach. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: I don't like it. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #3: It shows that he's out of touch that if he thinks that half of the country is that - feel like - feeling like victims. LIASSON: Mother Jones released the rest of the secret video today, including Romney's comments that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict would have to remain unsolved. And he described himself as uninterested in hearing more from a former secretary of state about prospects for peace. While some conservatives urged Romney to stick to his guns, others called his comments arrogant and stupid and his campaign depressingly inept. There are only 49 days to go until Election Day with the presidential debates the only remaining potential game changer on the schedule. And that leaves Republican strategist Ed Rogers worried. ED ROGERS: My candidate, Mitt Romney's campaign is very ragged right now. Again, there was the unexpected event of what happened in Libya. He sort of bobbled that, but it didn't matter a lot. Now there is the usual talk about internal strife within the campaign. And now there is this. In politics, bad gets worse. So Romney's in a very fragile position right now. He can weather this. And nothing has been said that's particularly horrific. It's all just been ragged and clutter. And clutter is Obama's friend and Romney's enemy. LIASSON: While Republican operatives watch from the sidelines hoping Romney can get himself back on track, some Republican candidates aren't waiting to find out.

            "article_content": "Vice President Joe Biden has been an important surrogate for President Obama this year, as he was four years ago. Biden especially excels at connecting with white, working-class voters \u2014 a group with which the president has struggled.  AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: Vice President Joe Biden campaigned for a second straight day in Iowa today. Biden is known for unscripted comments, and the crowds that gathered today seemed primed to hear him weigh in on the Mitt Romney's controversial remarks secretly recorded at a May fundraiser. But NPR's Don Gonyea reports, Biden didn't touch the topic. DON GONYEA, BYLINE: The vice president has always been the Obama campaign's go-to guy when it comes to reaching out to blue collar and working class voters. Biden rarely gets through a speech without mentioning his own roots. He's from the hard-scrabble city of Scranton, Pennsylvania. In the town of Ottumwa today, he spoke of changes to Medicare proposed by Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan that Biden says would cost the average senior citizen thousands of dollars every year. (SOUNDBITE OF CAMPAIGN SPEECH) VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: So folks, that's a lot of money where I come from. That's a lot of money in Ottumwa, that's a lot of money in Claymont, Delaware. GONYEA: The closest Biden came to directly responding to Romney in his speech was this, when he said under the Romney plan, middle class taxes will have to be raised to keep the deficit from getting worse if Romney refuses to allow any tax hikes on income more than $250,000 dollars a year. (SOUNDBITE OF CAMPAIGN SPEECH) BIDEN: And Romney calls the president out of touch? Out of touch? The guy with a Suiss bank account? A guy with tens of millions of dollars in the Grand Cayman islands? All legal, but out of touch? Ladies and gentlemen, I'll tell you what's out of touch. What's out of touch is what the governor and Congressman Ryan are proposing for the economy. GONYEA: Afterward, when Biden was shaking hands along the rope line, a reporter asked for a comment on Romney's remarks. He said the GOP candidate's words speak for themselves and kept shaking hands. In reality, Biden's usual stump speech serves as a kind of response to the Romney tape. The theme is often stand up for the little guy or for the person who has played by the rules but needs a hand. Here's how retired union plumber Jim Sinclair put it in Ottumwa this morning. JIM SINCLAIR: I'm just saying Joe Biden's one of us. I feel like he, what he says is the same thing that I've said for years and my family and what we think, you know, the people I work with. He just kind of connects to me, I guess. GONYEA: At this same event, 60-year-old Constance Miller of Ottumwa, said Romney's remarks were the talk of the day for those who arrived early to see Biden speak. CONSTANCE MILLER: You stand around for three hours, you make a few friends and we're all commenting about that, talking about that, about that bounce ad, how we thought that would make a difference to this election. I know, maybe I'm naive. GONYEA: Still she says she'd have liked to have heard Biden have some fun with Romney's comments to make a political point. Instead, Miller, a retired science teacher, offered her own reaction. MILLER: Oh, my gosh, we are the bottom feeders, the middle class people, you know, we teachers, librarians, social workers, those of us who have dedicated our lives to others. And I think that's what Romney, in my opinion, you know, he stuck his foot in his mouth. GONYEA: Later on in a coffee shop in Oscaloosa, Biden again declined to weigh in on the topic. He smiled and waved reporters off and as one whose own off-the-cuff words have occasionally sparked days of cable TV debate, Biden seemed more than satisfied to not step on the attention Romney is now getting.

            "article_content": "Mitt Romney's effort to refocus his GOP presidential campaign on substance hit a rough patch Monday night. A secretly filmed video, released by Mother Jones magazine, shows Romney saying nearly half of Americans think they are \"victims.\" Romney says his remarks were not elegantly stated.  RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: This is MORNING EDITION from NPR News. I'm Renee Montagne. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: And I'm Steve Inskeep. Mitt Romney says he's standing by the substance of his comments about American voters. A recording first revealed by Mother Jones magazine captured Romney at a fundraiser. He said 47 percent of Americans are hopelessly lost to President Obama, that they pay no income taxes, quote, \"think they are victims, that they're entitled,\" and that he can't make them take responsibility or care for their lives. Last night, Romney walked back some of the phrasing. MITT ROMNEY: It's not elegantly stated. Let me put it that way. I'm speaking off-the-cuff in response to a question. And I'm sure I could state it more clearly in a more effective way, than I did in a setting like that. INSKEEP: But having said that, Romney insisted he will stick with the message, as some conservatives, anyway, have urged them to do. NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson is on the line. Good morning, Mara. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Good morning, Steve. INSKEEP: What was Romney talking about? LIASSON: Romney was talking about, as you said, a secretly taped video which was made on May 17 at a fundraiser in Boca Raton. We don't know who made the recording. But in it, Romney says there are 47 percent of Americans who are going to vote for the president no matter what. (SOUNDBITE OF RECORDING) LIASSON: Ouch. So there's nothing like speaking to a room of wealthy donors and describing half of America is shiftless moochers and parasites to reinforce the stereotype that the Obama campaign has been working so hard to create of Romney, that he's rich and out of touch and doesn't understand the lives of ordinary Americans. This is a lot like what happened to President Obama in 2008, where he was surreptitiously filmed saying that certain working class voters cling to their God and guns. Only this one probably will have worse fallout. INSKEEP: Well, Romney was being rather specific here with his 47 percent and he's standing by it. So let's try to figure it out. Who are the 47 percent? LIASSON: Well, they're actually about 46 percent, according to a study. They don't pay income tax for a variety of reasons. Some of them are too poor to pay income tax. They're working poor, but they get tax credits. Some of them are elderly. Now, these people do pay plenty of tax. They pay payroll tax and sales tax and property taxes, but that's who he was talking about. INSKEEP: Well, let's listen to a little bit more of what Romney had to say about them. (SOUNDBITE OF RECORDING) LIASSON: This is a pretty stunning indictment - about half of the American people, that they'll never take personal responsibility and care for their lives. INSKEEP: David Brooks of The New York Times has already written about this - a withering column. I just want to read a bit of it here. He says, quote, \"The people who receive the disproportionate share of government spending are not big government lovers. They are Republicans. They are senior citizens. They are white men with high school degrees.\" And that the people who've benefited from the entitlements explosion are middle class workers, more so than that dependent poor. Was Romney actually talking - when he talked about his 47 percent - was he actually talking about a big part of the Republican base? LIASSON: Well, I think you're going to see a huge debate and a lot of discussion about what he was actually talking about. I think what he was referring to was what a lot of Republicans talk about when they talk about the people who pay no income tax. That's the tax that matters to conservatives. And it is a vision of people who get benefits from the government as opposed to the, quote, \"job creators.\" But he is standing by this basic argument, that he's offering an alternative to President Obama's, quote, \"government-centered society.\" INSKEEP: OK, you've already got political analysts saying, oh, the race is over now. But it is only September. Has this race shifted in any decisive way? LIASSON: Well, the race had shifted in a small way before he made these comments. President Obama is solidifying his small but steady lead in the battleground states. And this comes at a really bad time for the Romney campaign. He's been facing stories about internal disarray in his campaign. It makes it harder for the Romney campaign to control the message. They've been shifting strategies. They started out focusing exclusively on the economy. Then they flirted with the more ideological campaign when they picked Paul Ryan. Then it was foreign policy. Now they're trying to get him to talk more about his policies. But this comes at a time when one Republican after another is calling their campaign either depressingly inept, as David Brooks put it - troubled campaign. Republicans are really wringing their hands about this. INSKEEP: OK, thanks very much. That's NPR's Mara Liasson. LIASSON: Thank you, Steve. INSKEEP: And this morning, Mother Jones has released more tape of Romney at that fundraiser, this time discussing the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. He says, I'm torn. Romney says he sees no way to peace with the Palestinians: I look at the Palestinians not wanting to see peace anyway. Romney speaks instead of kicking the ball down the field. He adds that a former secretary of state called him to say peace might be possible, but Romney added: I didn't delve into it. Copyright \u00a9 2012 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "A recurring debate in the presidential contest is who's responsible when a business succeeds. The candidates' arguments have stirred a debate within the business community itself.  RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: A recurring debate in the American presidential contest is who is responsible when a business succeeds. Campaigning in Virginia this weekend, Mitt Romney repeated his assertion that it's individual entrepreneurs. MITT ROMNEY: I've been impressed by the American spirit of people who are can-do and take-charge, want to start and build things. And by the way, they do build it themselves. (SOUNDBITE OF CHEERING) STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Mitt Romney is riffing on President Obama's line, quote, \"you didn't build that.\" Republicans have said the president was suggesting business owners aren't responsible for their own success. The Obama camp has said the president was taken out of context, that he was really talking about roads and bridges - infrastructure that supports a business. But aside from the rhetorical debate, there is a difference of opinion. The president is arguing that Americans help each other to succeed. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: We also know that this country is built on the idea of citizenship; the idea that we have some obligations to each other. MONTAGNE: The candidates' arguments have stirred a debate within the business community itself. NPR's Scott Horsley has this story on one. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Norman Lizt and James Roumell are both financial professionals on opposite sides of the country, and opposite sides of the political divide. Lizt, who runs an investment company in California, took out a full page ad in The New York Times last month, threatening to close his business and lay off his half-dozen employees, if President Obama is re-elected. He's worried that if that happens, his marginal tax rate including California state taxes would top 50 percent, and that's a deal-breaker for him. NORMAN LIZT: If my partner is getting more than I am, that does not work for me. Over 50 percent, I'm a minority partner and it is I who built and is running the business. HORSLEY: Lizt admits when he entered the business in the 1960s, federal taxes were even higher, as much as 70 percent. But in those days he says there were loopholes big enough to drive a Hummer through. What's more, he thinks the president's plan to raise taxes only on the wealthy, is pure politics. LIZT: There's an enormous amount of class warfare that's going on. It's coming from a man, our president, who said he would do exactly the opposite. And, frankly, it's very frightening. HORSLEY: James Roumell, who runs an asset management company in Maryland, sees the world differently. JAMES ROUMELL: It wasn't Obama, it was Jesus who said it'll be much more difficult for a rich person to get into the kingdom of heaven. Was that class warfare? The point is, if you have a lot, you ought to be thinking about people around you that don't have a lot. HORSLEY: Roumell says his views are shaped by his Catholic faith and by his experience as a working-class kid from Detroit, who was only able to go to college because of government loans and grants. He also remembers the role that government played in stabilizing the financial markets during the worst of the crisis four years ago. The same week that Lizt's ad ran in The New York Times, Roumell published an op-ed in The Washington Post. The headline was: What I built With Government Help. ROUMELL: You know, where I come from you say thank you. I just think Uncle Sam has done a far better job of serving us and serving the country than he gets credit for. HORSLEY: If Lizt and Roumell were to sit down together, they might find some common ground. Lizt acknowledges an important role for government - in national defense and the social safety net. And Roumell agrees that some government dollars could be spent more wisely. But as symbols of the polarizing national argument, both men appear to have hit a nerve. Roumell's column in The Washington Post prompted nearly 4,000 comments on the newspaper's Web site. He thinks about 70 percent agreed with him. Lizt, in turn, got more than 100 emails after his ad appeared in The New York Times, about 60 percent in favor of his position. He's confident that if the ad had run in the Wall Street Journal, the feedback would have been 95 percent positive. LIZT: I don't believe in preaching to the choir. That's why I ran it in The Times. I'd rather look into the mouth of the lion. HORSLEY: Judging by the comments on the campaign trail this weekend, this is an argument that will keep roaring right through the November election.

            "article_content": "After his big convention speech Thursday and the weak job numbers Friday, President Obama hit the campaign trail. He spent the weekend on a bus tour of Florida.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: On a Monday, it's MORNING EDITION from NPR News. I'm Steve Inskeep. RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: And I'm Renee Montagne. Over the weekend, two very different approaches to campaigning by President Obama and Mitt Romney. INSKEEP: The Republican challenger was mostly out of sight, preparing for next month's presidential debates. Romney did, however, appear on Sunday morning TV shows and we'll have more on that in a moment. MONTAGNE: Let's go first to President Obama, who was on a bus tour across Florida. There were some big events with big crowds, but possibly just as important were the small, unannounced informal encounters with voters. NPR national political correspondent Don Gonyea went along. DON GONYEA, BYLINE: After two high energy rallies, Saturday in St. Petersburg and Kissimmee, the president was in the city of Melbourne near the Atlantic coast Sunday morning (SOUNDBITE OF CHEERING) PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: How's it going, Florida? (SOUNDBITE OF CHEERING) GONYEA: Cape Canaveral is not far away and the president spoke of a new direction for NASA, a major concern here now that the space shuttle program is over. OBAMA: Here on the Space Coast, we've started a new era of American exploration that is creating good jobs right here in this county. (SOUNDBITE OF CHEERING) GONYEA: He'd like to pick up some votes in a part of the state he lost four years ago, but events like this one were only part of his mission. The president's very first stop yesterday was at a bakery and cafe in the city of Cocoa, where he chatted up a group of teachers. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Our class is going to be so excited. We're studying the election. We've been talking about it. GONYEA: But one table over, a man gave the president a firm handshake and said he's voting for Romney. The exchange was very friendly. Driving down I-95, there was another unannounced stop yesterday, and it provided one of the strangest moments of this long campaign. The president walked into Big Apple Pizza and Pasta, where he was greeted by the owner, 46-year-old Scott Van Duzer. The two seemed to be old friends. OBAMA: How are you? Yeah. What's going on, man? GONYEA: Van Duzer, who has the body of weightlifter, was wearing a tight gray T-shirt and long workout shorts. Caught up in the moment, he wrapped his huge arms around the president and then lifted Mr. Obama a foot off the ground. (LAUGHTER) OBAMA: Look at that. Look at that. SCOTT VAN DUZER: Man, I'm so excited. GONYEA: Customers seated at nearby watched, eyes wide. Turns out Mr. Van Duzer is a Republican who voted for the president in '08 and says he'll do so again. The two men had never met. I asked him if he worried about how the Secret Service agent would react to his bear hug (LAUGHTER) DUZER: He said I was alright as long as I didn't take him away. So... (LAUGHTER) GONYEA: The Obama campaign is actively looking for ways to have him interact one on one with voters. They feel it's a contrast with Mitt Romney. It also shows that the president's awkwardness at bowling alleys and working class hangouts from back in 2008 is a thing of the past. Saturday night he surprised patrons at a sports bar in Orlando. He ordered a beer, sang Happy Birthday to one little girl, and teased a six-year-old boy born in Hawaii about whether he has his birth certificate. Yesterday afternoon, after leaving Mr. Van Duzer's place with a stack of pizzas in hand, the president delivered them to an Obama campaign office in Port St. Lucie. OBAMA: We brought everybody a little food 'cause I know you guys are working so hard. (SOUNDBITE OF CHEERING) GONYEA: He then sat down at a table do so some phone bank work on his own behalf. OBAMA: Hi. Is this Barney? Barney, this is Barack Obama (LAUGHTER) OBAMA: It is. (SOUNDBITE OF CHEERING) GONYEA: With the cheering volunteers and what seems to be renewed energy for the candidate, this weekend started to feel a bit like 2008 for the campaign. The rallies aren't as massive but they are growing, and those in attendance share a common goal and a readiness to work. To that end, thousands of them broke out in song in West Palm Beach at yesterday's final event, as they waited for the president to take the stage. UNIDENTIFIED CROWD: (Singing) Let's stay together. I want you whether, whether times are good or bad and happy or sad... GONYEA: The Al Green hit was once sung a cappella by the president himself at a campaign fundraiser. Yesterday, the crowd sent its own message. Don Gonyea, NPR News. Copyright \u00a9 2012 NPR.  All rights reserved.

In public, at least, they're the best of friends. And no one will have a more public role extolling President Obama than his Democratic predecessor, former President Bill Clinton. Clinton, who has already been featured in an Obama campaign ad, is speaking tonight at the Democratic National Convention in what is traditionally the prime spot reserved for the vice presidential nominee. \"He's clearly the best asset the Democrats have,\" says GOP consultant David Carney. \"Clinton is their best surrogate.\" If even a Republican like Carney is willing to extol Clinton's political virtues, it still comes as a bit of a surprise that Obama would deploy Clinton as his top spokesman. Clinton, naturally, was rooting for his wife when Hillary went head to head with Obama in the Democratic primaries four years ago. He derided Obama's candidacy at the time as \"the biggest fairy tale I've ever seen\" and reportedly dismissed Obama by saying, \"A few years ago, this guy would have been getting us coffee\" (or \"carrying our bags,\" depending on the source.) But that was, well, a few years ago. Obama and Clinton's evolution from feuding to friends has been the subject of intense media interest, including the cover story of Newsweek. \"The fact that President Clinton and President Obama had been in conflict makes his support even stronger now,\" says Michael Waldman, chief speechwriter in the Clinton White House. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out why Clinton is being showcased at the convention. Clinton exemplifies perhaps the most crucial political gift that Obama seems to lack \u2014 put simply, the human touch. That's an area in which Obama has been accused of lacking deftness, whether it comes to the congressional powers that be or major campaign donors. And, as Carney suggests, Clinton offers Obama something else he desperately wants \u2014 a reminder of better days under Democratic leadership. Clinton has remained unusually active for an ex-president in certain policy areas, such as AIDS and climate change. But it's mainly nostalgia for his presidency of the 1990s that Democrats hope to trade on. Clinton presided over the longest unbroken economic expansion in U.S. history and left the federal budget in surplus. \"His mere persona up there harkens in many Democratic minds back to better times,\" says Henry Cisneros, who served as Clinton's housing secretary. \"He can articulate the economic arguments in a way that few people can.\" Clinton will certainly speak to the economy \u2014 and doubtless will deride Republicans for invoking his name in their attacks against Obama's welfare policies. His primary role might be acting as character witness for Obama before the demographic group most reluctant to embrace Obama: the white working class. \"It's not that Obama's going to win the white working class, but he needs not to lose 61 percent of their vote, like House Democrats [in 2010],\" says Henry Olsen, vice president of the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. Clinton may offer a link back to days when Democrats were more competitive among white working-class voters \u2014 as well as a reminder that Democrats once could speak with a Southern accent and win. But even in the Democratic primaries in 2008, many white working-class voters preferred Hillary Clinton over Obama. And tonight, millions of white working-class Americans will be tuned in not to convention proceedings but to the NFL season opener. \"Bill Clinton spent a lot of his political career thinking about the economic issues that affect working-class voters and crafted a message for the party that the party still uses,\" says Waldman, who is now president of the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University. Still, he adds, \"I don't think it's like a gift certificate that one politician can hand over to another.\" There also may be some irony in the fact that one of the leading speakers at a convention designed largely to appeal to female voters was himself nearly driven from office by a sex scandal involving a young female intern. That aside, as Waldman points out, Clinton offers Democrats something they hadn't had for a very long time: a popular ex-president. Clinton was the first Democrat to serve two full terms as president since Franklin Roosevelt, who died in 1945. Clinton, in fact, is playing a bigger political part than any ex-president in living memory. It has long been the norm that former presidents have appeared at their parties' conventions, but most have stayed out of the spotlight the rest of the time. Most have been either too old upon leaving office or too unpopular to do their parties much good. \"Clinton has essentially defined a post-presidential role as party leader in a way that virtually no previous president since Teddy Roosevelt has aspired to do,\" says Hal Bass, a political scientist at Ouachita Baptist University in Arkadelphia, Ark. \"Clinton enjoys the rehabilitation that he has found in the political arena,\" Bass says.",

The mayor will give the keynote address Tuesday night, introduced by his brother, a Texas legislator. Julian Castro, the 37-year-old mayor of San Antonio, Texas, has been called the new face of the Democratic Party. And on Tuesday night, he'll become the first Latino to deliver the keynote speech at the party's national convention. Over the weekend, parishioners at St. Paul Catholic Church in San Antonio sent off one of their own with a breakfast taco rally. \"It's a great step when you look at the progressions that happened with the parities that have gone from not recognizing the Hispanic community to having somebody in the very front, you know, being the keynote speaker,\" said parishioner Larry Ybarra. \"That's like a thousand percent improvement over the last several years.\" This is the neighborhood where Castro and his twin brother, Joaquin, grew up \u2014 going to Jefferson High School just down the street. Before becoming mayor, Julian Castro represented this working-class Mexican-American neighborhood on the city council. Joaquin Castro is a state representative in Austin and a Democratic nominee for Congress. Their mother, Rosie, raised the boys as a single mom, pushing them to stay out of trouble and excel in school. It's a success story not unlike President Obama's. Local Tea Party activists say there's another comparison between Obama and the Castro brothers. \"I see a very clear similarity between the upbringing that Mr. Obama had in a nontraditional home and being mentored by radicals and the same thing with the Castros being brought up in a nontraditional home by their mother, who herself was a member of the Raza Unida Party, which was very, very radical,\" said activist George Rodriguez. In the '70s, Raza Unida was a civil rights organization that campaigned for better working, housing and education opportunities for Mexican-Americans. Castro's mother was one of its leaders in South Texas. She broke barriers by organizing voter registration, getting out the vote and putting new Mexican-American candidates on the ballot. Julian Castro shrugs off any suggestion that Raza Unida was a radical cell. \"If somebody calls trying to get people to vote radical, then that's quite a difference from the United States, because the democratic process is about the biggest blessing we have in this country,\" he said. When the brothers arrived at Julian's sendoff at the church hall, the crowd went wild, slapping their backs and snapping smartphone photos. The mayor told the crowd that when he speaks at the convention, he \"won't be talking to any empty chairs up there.\" He said he did watch parts of last week's GOP convention in Tampa, Fla., and he expects a more positive tone at the DNC in Charlotte, N.C. He has been practicing using a teleprompter and tweaking the speech that he says will tell his version of the American dream and explain why he supports Obama's re-election. \"I would be lying if I said I wasn't a little bit nervous \u2014 it's something new,\" Castro said. \"But by the time I get up there on Tuesday night, I'll be ready.\" The feeling around the neighborhood is that history is taking place \u2014 that a local boy is heading for Charlotte and coming back a national political figure, who one day might be running for the White House himself.",

Marco Rubio speaks Tuesday in Tampa. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio says America will have a different view of Mitt Romney by the time he accepts the Republican nomination for president. Rubio will introduce Romney on Thursday, the final night of the Republican National Convention. He may have provided a preview of his speech to a gathering of Florida delegates Tuesday. \"Mitt Romney is a special human being,\" Rubio said. \"You look at the way Mitt Romney has lived his life as a father, as a husband, as a grandfather, as a leader in his church and his community. I mean, he is a role model for what all of us hope our kids will grow up to be.\" Polls show voters find President Obama more likable than Romney. But Rubio told a gathering of Florida delegates that those poll numbers will begin to change after this week. \"I think on Thursday night it will be clear to the American people not just that he's a special person, but that he offers a very different view of the future than the current president does.\" Interestingly, Rubio's comments came the same day that another highlighted speaker, South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, said this: \"Do I think Gov. Romney needs to be more likeable? ... No.\" Voters don't care, Haley argued, \"who looks the best ... who acts the best ... [or] who looks good holding a baby.\" The son of Cuban immigrants, Rubio is a rising star in the Republican Party. His growing national profile is one reason protesters ambushed his speech Tuesday. At least eight people were removed from the Innisbrook Resort in Palm Harbor, where the Florida Republican National Convention delegation is staying. A Pinellas County sheriff's deputy said the protesters were only being warned for trespassing, but would be arrested if they returned. \"We the working class demand the GOP stop whoring themselves out to the big-money interests ... and trying to squeeze every last dime out of the working class,\" shouted a man who would only identify himself as \"John.\" Rubio just rolled with the punches. \"Well, I guess he's not happy with the hotel assignment,\" Rubio quipped, referencing the distance the Florida delegation is staying from downtown Tampa. \"Did he eat the food?\" Rubio still managed to fire up the Florida delegation, telling them the country is \"one election away from a new beginning.\" And if Romney can't win this November, many Republicans believe it's Rubio who can be part of that new beginning in 2016.

            "article_content": "Republican vice-presidential candidate Paul Ryan campaigned solo in Pennsylvania on Tuesday, one day after campaigning with Mitt Romney in New Hampshire.  AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Audie Cornish. MELISSA BLOCK, HOST: I'm Melissa Block. And we begin this hour in Pennsylvania. When it comes to presidential elections, the state has been reliably blue, but Mitt Romney and his new running mate hope to change that. Paul Ryan held two events in Pennsylvania today, while Romney was raising money out of the public spotlight. NPR's Ari Shapiro reports from the campaign trail. ARI SHAPIRO, BYLINE: With 20 electoral votes, Pennsylvania could be the second biggest swing state in the country - that is, if Pennsylvania really is a swing state. The last time the state chose a Republican for president was 24 years ago. DAVID FREED: National pundits think that we can't win Pennsylvania for Mitt Romney. SHAPIRO: At a rally outside Pittsburgh this morning, Dave Freed, who's running for Pennsylvania attorney general, said the pundits are wrong. FREED: Let me tell you, I'm out there every day, all over this state - northwest, southwest, southeast, central Pennsylvania. The energy that's in this room is similar all over this state. SHAPIRO: And there was a lot of energy in the steel processing plant. Even more when Paul Ryan ran in swinging a bright yellow Terrible Towel over his head for the Pittsburgh Steelers football team. The music, \"We're Not Gonna Take It.\" PAUL RYAN: Hey, hey, hey, hey. How about it, huh? Man. SHAPIRO: A couple thousand people chanted: Here we go, Ryan, here we go. RYAN: All right. CROWD: (Chanting) Here we go, Ryan, here we go. Here we go, Ryan, here we go. RYAN: Thanks, man. SHAPIRO: Ryan accused President Obama of slicing up the American pie and deciding who gets how big a piece. And he said that's not the job of government. RYAN: The job of government is to set the conditions for economic growth so we can grow the pie and everybody can get a bigger slice of the American pie through economic growth, through opportunity, through achievement, upward mobility. SHAPIRO: He reminded the audience of a comment the president made four years ago at a fundraiser about people who cling to guns and religion. RYAN: Hey, I'm a Catholic deer hunter. I am happy to be clinging to my guns and my religion. SHAPIRO: Paul Ryan brings a different kind of energy to a rally than Mitt Romney. You would never see Romney run in swinging a towel over his head, and the conservative base loves the guy. Dan Mahon was never too fired up about Romney. DAN MAHON: I like Ryan more than Romney, but that's my personal opinion. I'm a Catholic. I'm more social conservative than I believe Romney is. SHAPIRO: He's also an electrician, the kind of white, blue-collar, working class guy that neither Romney nor the president has really connected with. Peggy Donnelly of Lebanon, Pennsylvania believes the likeability and enthusiasm that Ryan brings to the ticket will finally flip this blue state red. PEGGY DONNELLY: I've made signs. I'm gonna make phone calls, energize people to see the truth. That's the problem. People aren't telling the truth. Medicare, 55 years and up will not be touched. That's their swan song - everybody's gonna lose it. People have to know the truth. I'm gonna speak the truth. I'm excited for our state. We're gonna take it back. SHAPIRO: Recent polls show President Obama with roughly a six-point lead in the state. He was here on a bus tour in July, and Romney came through Pennsylvania that month too. According to data from National Journal, the Obama campaign and an outside group supporting him have spent almost $8 million on ads in Pennsylvania. The Romney campaign has spent none, though conservative outside groups have spent close to $9 million on ads. That suggests both sides believe the state is in play this year, despite its long blue history. Ari Shapiro, NPR News, traveling with the Ryan campaign. Copyright \u00a9 2012 NPR.

            "article_content": "GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney flew from Boston down to Virginia on Friday to launch a four-day swing-state bus tour. President Obama will start his own trip Monday, campaigning in Iowa for three days. In the meantime, the two campaigns continue to joust over a series of ads, each side accusing the other of lying. The Obama campaign's TV ad quotes The New York Times and The Washington Post saying Romney's claims that the president gutted welfare reform are blatantly false. On the other side, the conservative outside group American Crossroads went meta with a Web ad featuring a CNN broadcast about a TV ad. Despite the intense negativity on both sides, three national polls gave Obama good news this week. Surveys from CNN, Fox and Reuters all give the president a wider edge than he had before. The Romney camp dismissed those polls on Friday. In a background briefing with reporters, a senior adviser argued that they're just wrong. \"There's been no national news that would push us from minus 3 points to minus 9 points,\" the adviser said. \"That's a huge shift.\" Of course, the assessment that there's been no national news dismisses the impact of Romney's foreign trip and the deluge of ads from both sides. Over the next four days of the bus tour, Romney will try to change those trends in four swing states that the president won in 2008 \u2014 Virginia, North Carolina, Florida and Ohio. Stops include a NASCAR mechanic school and a barbecue shack. These are places where Romney can connect with working-class voters, but also places where his white-collar New England background could rub people the wrong way. \"He just doesn't seem to fit in with day-to-day people,\" says Brad Elwinger, a Democrat in Des Moines, where Romney campaigned earlier this week. \"I don't want to go with the rich card; he just seems like he's kind of in his own world. He has a hard time relating to people. When I hear him speak to people he doesn't seem to gel with them, I guess. It's just a vibe I get from him.\" Romney adviser Eric Fehrnstrom said he doesn't buy the idea that Romney has a problem connecting with average people. \"I think Americans of all types find Mitt Romney an appealing public leader. They look at his record of success \u2014 whether it's at the Olympics or here in the state of Massachusetts as governor or as a private businessman \u2014 and they are impressed by it,\" he said. But in a new survey from CNN, 64 percent of Americans say they believe that Romney favors the rich over the middle class. That's been a criticism of Romney from the beginning. And it's a challenge he'll have to overcome to win the votes of the swing-state voters he'll be meeting with over the next four days.",

In 2008, it gave an unexpectedly big boost to Democratic candidate Barack Obama. This year the contest is shaping up to be much closer as Nevada copes with both the worst unemployment in the nation and one of the country's highest home foreclosure rates.  RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: It's MORNING EDITION, from NPR News. Good morning. I'm Renee Montagne. Nevada has just six electoral votes, but it's a state that's much fought over in presidential elections. In 2008, Nevada gave an unexpectedly big boost to Democratic candidate Barack Obama. He carried the state by more than 12 points, thanks to unions and the Hispanic vote. This year, the contest is shaping up to be much closer, as Nevada copes with both the worst unemployment in the nation and one of the country's highest home foreclosure rates. NPR's Don Gonyea reports. DON GONYEA, BYLINE: It's Las Vegas and it's July, and the thermometer on the car's dashboard reads 111 degrees in the noon hour. Still, volunteer canvassers Yolanda Florian and Faviola Morales, clipboards in hand, step out onto the heat of the parking lot of an apartment complex on the city's east side. Air conditioning units hum as they approach each door. YOLANDA FLORIAN: Let's start here and we'll go back. FAVIOLA MORALES: Yeah. (SOUNDBITE OF KNOCKING ON DOOR) GONYEA: Florian and Morales are members of the Service Employees International Union. This is a working-class neighborhood. Lot's of people aren't home. Some are probably sleeping. Las Vegas is a city where night shifts are common. But about every fourth or fifth door opens up, and introductions follow. FLORIAN: Are you registered to vote, then, already? UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Yes. FLORIAN: You are? That's great, that's always good news. One of the things that we're coming around, making sure people are registered to vote. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: As long as you're for Obama. MORALES: And we are. And we're going to leave you this one, anyway. I know you probably have the information. GONYEA: This man is an Obama supporter. That's what the canvassers want to hear. But they still ask a series of questions to make sure he knows when Election Day is and to make sure he knows where to vote. That's a huge issue in this state this year, because so many people lost their jobs or lost their homes or both, forcing them to relocate. JOHN RALSTON: The foreclosure problem's been a big, big issue in voter registration. GONYEA: That's John Ralston, a Las Vegas political columnist. To vote in Nevada, you need to be registered at your current address. Ralston says it's been a problem for Democrats, who have seen a huge advantage in registration shrink as a result. It's all part of a bad economic climate in the state, which includes a jobless rate of 11.7 percent. RALSTON: I think you could argue that we have the worst economy in the country because we've been so dependent for so long on such a narrow economic base of gaming and not much else - construction to some extent - and that's all just collapsed. GONYEA: Republicans are trying to capitalize on all of this. Phil Perrine owns a real estate company in Las Vegas and supports Romney. PHIL PERINE: It's housing. It's bankruptcies. It's joblessness, and they all combine and they all feed on one another, so to speak. And you've got to attack it on all fronts and probably the jobs situation is the most important. GONYEA: But if Republicans want economic woes to help Romney, the candidate failed to help himself when he said there should be no government help to deal with the housing and foreclosure problems. He was talking to the editorial board of the Las Vegas Review Journal last fall, and the session was videotaped. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO) GONYEA: It was akin to his remarks about the struggling domestic auto industry when he said let Detroit go bankrupt. But the Obama campaign also has its own problems with Nevada. The state's largest union and its most politically powerful, the Culinary Union, has said it is going to sit this one out - not because of discontent with President Obama, but because they're in the midst of critical contract negotiations, and they've got a difficult organizing drive underway at some non-union casinos. Culinary Union leader D. Taylor says these concerns are more critical to his members. D. TAYLOR: We can't do three things at once. I always say I can walk and chew gum. I can't walk, chew gum and juggle at the same time. I just can't. It's not possible. And like I said, the contracts are our most important thing. GONYEA: Right now, polls in Nevada give the president a narrow lead - a far cry from his landslide victory in the state in '08. But it's still July, and as hot as it is in Las Vegas right now, the political contest won't come to a full boil until after Labor Day. Don Gonyea, NPR News. Copyright \u00a9 2012 NPR.

Mark Warner (left), D-Va., and Democratic Senate candidate Tim Kaine during a campaign stop Friday in Virginia Beach, Va. Yes, Virginia, you are this election year's Santa Claus. And it could be your bag of 13 presidential electoral votes that will be the key to deciding who occupies the White House in January. Proof of Virginia's gathering importance? President Obama is in the midst of a two-day Virginia campaign swing. Republican candidate Mitt Romney dispatched former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani to counterattack Friday. The airwaves are awash in campaign ads, and there's a veritable who-has-more-campaign-offices arms race well under way. It's a situation that astounds lifelong Virginians like political analyst Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia's Center for Politics. \"It's really quite amazing that Virginia has become ground zero in a presidential campaign,\" he told NPR. \"It's almost the new Ohio.\" \"Who,\" he asks, \"could have imagined it?\" Polls show a tight race, with averages giving Obama a slight edge in the state. When Obama, buoyed by a huge voter turnout in 2008, became the first Democratic presidential candidate to win the state in 44 years, it revealed how much the changing demographics of the Old Dominion were remaking its politics. His winning margin in Virginia, 53 percent to 46 percent, was identical to his national numbers. Though some exuberant Democrats at the time predicted that the Obama win was proof that Virginia was moving more quickly than anyone anticipated from Republican red to Democratic blue, GOP candidates have won every statewide office since. Analysts view Virginia as crucial to a Romney win; and though they see a path to victory for Obama even if he loses Virginia, it would not bode well for the president to lose a state where the economy ranks among the nation's most robust. \"If he loses Virginia, given its 5.6 percent unemployment rate, it suggests the president will have a tough time winning a second term,\" Sabato says. But if Romney doesn't carry Virginia, he says, \"it's hard to see him getting to 270.\" That's the magic number \u2014 the Electoral College votes needed to capture the White House. With the presidential campaigns' intense focus on Virginia, a concurrent dead-heat U.S. Senate battle there between two popular former governors, and an avalanche of money and political ads, we decided to take a look what the ground looks likes just south of the nation's capital. State Of The Economy Fueled by government (including military) spending, Virginia's unemployment rate never strayed above 7.3 percent during the economic downturn. It now sits at 5.6 percent. That's among the 10 lowest state rates in the nation. The national unemployment rate hit 10 percent in 2010; it is now calculated at 8.2 percent. Bankruptcy filings in Virginia are running below the national average, and housing prices are running above, according to a recent analysis of the state's economy by James Glassman of JPMorgan Chase. Employment is growing \"at a respectable pace,\" Glassman wrote in his June 30 analysis, and \"the state's job market is relatively rosy.\" The state, he said, \"has made considerable progress recovering or restoring the jobs it lost in the recession.\" That makes Romney's economic argument against Obama more difficult than in other important swing states, like Nevada, for example, which has the nation's highest unemployment rate of 11.6 percent, and the highest foreclosure rate. \"Federal spending, defense spending, the stimulus money \u2014 that's why Obama has a good case to make in Virginia,\" says Sabato, \"and why I say if he can't carry Virginia, he's probably not going to win.\" Romney's Virginia-tailored message? It was carried to the state by Giuliani: Obama, he told veterans gathered at an event in Virginia Beach, is targeting military cuts that would put \"your region of your country right in his crosshairs.\" Demographic Download What's changing in Virginia? Earlier this year, we spoke with Ruy Teixeira, a political demographer at the liberal Center for American Progress, about the changing face of Virginia, and how that has affected the vote. Obama won, he said, because the state has more minorities, more white college graduates and an \"ongoing and pretty sharp decline in the number of white working class\" residents who, in Virginia, are \"particularly unfriendly to Democrats.\" Obama in 2008 lost white working class voters in Virginia by 34 points, and is not expected to do better this time. He got 80 percent of the minority vote nationwide, Teixeira said, but captured 83 percent of the minority vote in Virginia. Sabato tells us that minorities now make up about 30 percent of the state's population. If Democrats pick up 80 percent of the minority vote, he said, they can lose the white vote \"pretty substantially\" and still win. The demographic changes are most significant in the Washington suburbs of Northern Virginia. Sabato characterizes the area as the \"least like Old Virginia \u2014 more like Maryland than it's like North Carolina.\" A third of the state's voters now reside in Northern Virginia. Geoffrey Skelley, also at the University of Virginia's Center for Politics, recently wrote, however, that Northern Virginia is \"just one part of the story.\" Greater Richmond, which includes the state capital; Hampton Roads, which includes Virginia Beach; and Northern Virginia together form an \"urban crescent,\" Skelley wrote. Collectively, it has two-thirds of the state's population and is \"key to victory,\" especially for Democrats. \"As Barack Obama showed in 2008,\" Skelley said, \"a candidate who wins all three can make the rest of the state's vote irrelevant.\" Why Here? Obama's campaign swing is taking him to Hampton, Virginia Beach, Roanoke, Henrico County outside Richmond, and Northern Virginia. Those are some of the same places Giuliani is hitting for Romney, and where voters are being bombarded with campaign ads and calls. Obama won in those areas in 2008, with the exception of Virginia Beach, and quite handily: He took Hampton with nearly 70 percent of the vote, Roanoke City and Northern Virginia's Fairfax County with more than 60 percent, and Henrico with 56 percent. He and GOP presidential candidate John McCain split the vote in Virginia Beach, 49 percent for Obama, 50 percent for McCain. \"The president obviously is trying to maximize his vote among his strongest constituents,\" Sabato says. Republicans, he says, can no longer assume that military areas like Virginia Beach, for example, will be in their corner. \"The military itself is more diverse than it used to be, and on account of that, it's actually a competitive vote,\" he said. \"It can go either way.\" In the Richmond area, once the state's most conservative stronghold, educated suburban whites who are moderate on social issues have changed the calculation. Though not reliable Democratic voters, \"they're willing to vote for a Democrat,\" Sabato says, \"in some circumstances.\" As Teixeira has said: \"This is not your father's Virginia.\"",

Sherrod Brown speaks in Columbus, Ohio, in May. Brown, who is up for re-election this year, says he wakes up every day \"trying to figure out how to create jobs.\" President Obama hits the campaign trail Thursday with a bus tour in Ohio. The state is a crucial battleground not only for the presidential election, but also because it could decide whether Democrats keep control of the Senate. Up for re-election there is Democrat Sherrod Brown, who is being challenged by the state's Republican treasurer, Josh Mandel. Mandel is highlighting Brown's staunch support of the new health care law \u2014 with a big assist from outside groups. On Cleveland's West Side this week, Brown faced a gaggle of reporters and onlookers in a corridor lined with fruit and vegetable stalls. \"Thank you all for joining us in one of America's and Ohio's and Cleveland's greatest institutions,\" he said, \"the West Side Market.\" Brown came to the 100-year-old market on official business, touting a federal grant that helps vendors accept food stamps. But later in an interview, the talk quickly turned to his campaign and to Mandel, whose name Brown never mentioned. \"The difference between me and my opponent, by and large, is that I wake up every day trying to figure out how to create jobs,\" he said. \"My opponent wakes up every day and figures out what office to run for next, and that really is the contrast. I'm doing my job every day. That's why it's no surprise when you pick a day to come out here that I'm doing my work, not campaigning.\" Support For An Unpopular Law Brown is one of 60 senators who voted for the new health care law, and he's pleased most of it was upheld by the Supreme Court. But when asked whether he'll now campaign on that widely unpopular law, Brown demurred. \"My view is there are so many good things in it, I supported it and will continue to,\" he said, \"but it's important that the politics stop here, that instead of people trying to get political benefit from this, that we move on and focus on what we ought to be doing, and that's job creation.\" Some shoppers said they'd like Brown to talk more about the health care law. \"He voted for it,\" Nancy Wassen, a Democrat from Ashland, said. \"I think he kind of has to at least include that in what he talks about.\" Others, though, advised caution. \"Right now, there are a lot of people that are against Obamacare, so I'm not sure that that's the wisest decision to make,\" said Laura Dorrie, a retired teacher who described herself as an undecided independent. A Fast-Rising Star There was a big turnout Wednesday at the Fourth of July parade in the working-class Cleveland suburb of Parma, which Obama plans to visit Thursday. He'll get there on the heels of Mandel. Ohio State Treasurer Josh Mandel speaks at the Ohio Citizens PAC fundraising dinner in Columbus on Friday. Mandel, a Tea Party favorite, is challenging Brown for his Senate seat.\n                \n                    \n                    Copyright T.J.

Mandel, a Tea Party favorite, is challenging Brown for his Senate seat. Mandel is 34 years old but could easily be mistaken for a teenager. This former Marine intelligence officer did two tours in Iraq; he's a fast-rising star in the Republican Party and a Tea Party favorite. In an interview, Mandel said three things are on his mind when he gets up in the morning: \"Being a good husband, being a good state treasurer, and going to Washington to change our country.\" To do that, Mandel said, he'll keep reminding voters of Brown's vote for the health care law. \"Sherrod Brown held in his hands the power to stop this government-run health care act,\" he said, \"but instead of stopping it, he cast the deciding vote on the federal government's takeover of health care.\" The independent fact-checking group Politifact has labeled that deciding-vote charge false. It's not the only questionable claim Mandel has been making. He also said he's the underdog when it comes to campaign spending. \"At the end of the day, you know, Sherrod Brown's going to have a lot more money than we're going to have,\" he said, \"but this race ain't about money.\" Not About Money? Records provided by the Brown campaign show outside groups backing Mandel have spent nearly five times more than groups backing Brown. \"You have certainly more money being spent by the Republicans,\" said Ken Goldstein of Kantar Media Group, which tracks TV ad spending in the Ohio Senate race. \"And most of that is due to the group spending that is being done on Josh Mandel's part.\" Nearly $10 million worth of TV ads paid for by outside groups and favoring Mandel have already aired in Ohio, including one from Crossroads GPS that says it's no surprise Brown voted for Obamacare: \"He supports Obama's agenda 95 percent of the time.\" Groups such as Crossroads GPS don't have to disclose their donors. Brown said he suspects the money is coming from business groups opposed to his union-friendly voting record. \"I mean, I know who doesn't like me from outside the state, but I think this money is really all about this,\" he said. \"Without that outside money for my opponent, this wouldn't be much of a race.\" Recent polls show Brown ahead of Mandel by single digits \u2014 a gap that is narrowing as outside money continues to pour in.",

Now it appears the attendance for the event is shrinking, too. At least a dozen Democrats say they won't be able to make it to Charlotte, N.C., when the convention begins Sept. 4. It's no coincidence that all are facing tough election campaigns in places where President Obama's popularity lags. Four years ago, then-West Virginia Gov. Joe Manchin addressed Democrats gathered in Denver for their party's convention. He gave a full-throated endorsement of the man the party would soon nominate as its standard-bearer. \"Barack Obama is the only candidate in this race who has captured our nation's hopes for the kind of change we so desperately need,\" said Manchin. \"Let's do what's right for America and elect Barack Obama as the next president of the United States.\" Joe Manchin, then-governor of West Virginia, speaks at the 2008 Democratic National Convention in Denver. Now a U.S. senator up for re-election, Manchin said he won't attend the convention in Charlotte, N.C.\n                \n                    \n                    Ron Edmonds/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Joe Manchin, then-governor of West Virginia, speaks at the 2008 Democratic National Convention in Denver. Now a U.S. senator up for re-election, Manchin said he won't attend the convention in Charlotte, N.C. That was 2008. In 2012, now-Sen. Manchin won't be attending, much less addressing the convention where Obama will be renominated. Instead, according to a statement from his office, Manchin will be \"focused on the people of West Virginia.\" Manchin is running for re-election in a state where being on the same ballot as the Democratic president is not likely to be helpful. Among the 12 Democrats who have said they will be skipping the Democratic convention are Sen. Jon Tester from Montana and Sen. Claire McCaskill of Missouri. \"It's like a luxury to go to a party convention,\" says McCaskill. \"I think most of the media spends most of its time talking about how worthless these conventions have become, and then they try to make a big deal out of the fact that people aren't going to them. I think it has everything to do with me being in a tough race. I have never attended a convention when I've been in a contested race.\" McCaskill was an early supporter of Obama, and says she hopes he will campaign in Missouri, which the president narrowly lost in 2008. Others Opting To Campaign While Obama has a better shot of carrying Pennsylvania, he's probably not going to win the 12th Congressional District of Democratic Rep. Mark Critz in the southwestern part of the state. \"It's a blue-collar, working-class district that tends to be pro-life and pro-gun, one that the president historically has had trouble with. And as a result of that, Critz, like some other Democrats around the country, sort of Blue Dog types, are resisting getting too closely connected with the administration,\" says Terry Madonna of Franklin & Marshall College in Lancaster, Pa. That includes Rep. John Barrow of Georgia; Reps. Bill Owens and Kathy Hochul, both of northern New York; Rep. Jim Matheson of Utah; former surgeon general and now U.S. Senate candidate from Arizona Richard Carmona; and Senate candidate Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota. All have said they won't attend the convention. West Virginia Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin and Rep. Nick Rahall also say they will not be in Charlotte in September. Romney Camp Mocks 'Debacle' These are the latest blows to convention organizers, who have had a rocky time of it lately. On Monday, they announced they were moving a big Labor Day rally that had been planned for the Charlotte Motor Speedway to a smaller site in the uptown area of the city. Republicans are predictably having fun with the announced Democratic no-shows. A release from Mitt Romney's campaign was gleefully headlined, \"Debacle: Dozen Dem Defectors Ditch DNC.\" McCaskill calls it a no-win situation. \"I think if I went to the convention, the Republican operatives would be trying to get all of the press to talk about the fact that I'm ignoring Missourians in favor of bigwig donors and party hacks,\" she says. \"So I think I'm in one of those situations that no matter what I have chosen, the folks running against me would have found something to be critical of.\" And McCaskill and other Democrats are getting some cover from party leaders. The head of the Democratic House campaign committee says it makes sense for Democrats to stay in their districts during the convention \u2014 the same advice the party gave its candidates four years ago.",

The former president has become Obama's highest-profile advocate this campaign season.\n                \n                    \n                    Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Former President Bill Clinton and President Obama used to have a famously rocky relationship. But the days when Clinton tried to help his wife, now secretary of state, defeat Obama in the 2008 primaries are ancient history. Former Clinton strategist Carter Eskew says the ex-president is almost always an asset for Obama. \"Bill Clinton can do a lot of things for Barack Obama,\" Eskew says. \"He can raise a lot of money. He has very good political instincts and good political ideas. And in an interesting way, Bill Clinton may be able to carry the positive narrative for Barack Obama better than Obama can.\" As Obama tries to explain his economic plan to cut the deficit while investing in clean energy, education and infrastructure, he can look to the script Clinton wrote in the 1990s. And Clinton, as a former commander in chief, can help in other ways. He appeared in the first Obama re-election campaign ad \u2014 describing the risk Obama took when he ordered the raid that killed Osama bin Laden. And the former president can skewer Republican challenger Mitt Romney. In this example, Clinton was speaking at a fiscal policy summit: \"It's like Romney said, 'I'm running for the president of the student body of this extreme right-wing group, and the real argument was that I couldn't be their president because I wasn't right wing enough, so I had to get over there and pretend that I was.' \" Clinton's point was that it's hard to know who Romney really is. But sometimes Obama's No. 1 surrogate messes up the talking points. Like the other day on CNN, when Clinton undercut the Obama campaign's attacks on Romney's record as a businessman and a governor. \"There's no question that, in terms of getting up, going to the office and basically performing the essential functions of the office, a man who's been governor and had a sterling business career crosses the qualification threshold,\" Clinton said. It would be hard to keep the active and voluble former president off the political scene, and for better or worse, he has become the president's highest-profile advocate. But what's more surprising is that he has been given a role in Romney's stump speech. In Des Moines, Iowa, recently, Romney reminded voters that almost a generation ago, Clinton announced that the era of \"Big Government\" was over. \"President Clinton was signaling to his own party that Democrats should no longer try to govern by proposing a new program for every problem,\" Romney said. \"President Obama tucked away the Clinton doctrine in his large drawer of discarded ideas, along with transparency and bipartisanship.\" After the laughter subsided, Romney went on, \"It's enough to make you wonder if maybe it was a personal beef with the Clintons, but probably it runs much deeper than that.\" Was Romney trying to revive the feud between the Obamas and the Clintons? That seems unlikely. Instead, says Republican strategist Keith Appell, Romney is trying to target Clinton fans \u2014 rural, white, working-class voters in swing states. \"The Romney campaign sees an opportunity to get those people in his column, and not only in states like West Virginia, which is probably going to go for Romney anyway, but people across the border in Ohio and in Pennsylvania,\" Appell says. \"A lot of those folks are Hillary Clinton supporters and fans of Bill Clinton, and they're up for grabs.\" Those voters, says Appell, remember that under Clinton, budgets got balanced and welfare was ended \u2014 the kinds of positive economic news they're not seeing under Obama. But former Clinton adviser Paul Begala says that tactic could backfire on Romney. \"All he's doing is setting himself up for a fall,\" Begala says. \"So he goes to, say, southern Ohio, critical swing area, pretty Republican area but the kind of place where President Clinton is very popular, even though it's a pretty Republican area, and he says things like that \u2014 well, then Bill Clinton can come in and he'll have the last word.\" And the last word from Bill Clinton will be: Vote for Barack Obama.",

Sullivan/NJ.com\n                    \n                \nhide caption There was a time when U.S. House colleagues Bill Pascrell and Steve Rothman, Democrats from neighboring congressional districts in northern New Jersey, called themselves friends. But congressional redistricting means Pascrell and Rothman will face off in the state's Democratic primary on Tuesday for one congressional seat. And despite their long friendship, the race has been anything but collegial. \"Bill voted to give this estate tax relief to billionaires. He changed his mind in further years, in further votes,\" claimed Rothman at a debate this month. \"I say that I'm the Democrat's Democrat up here.\" Rothman, who currently represents the state's 9th District, has tried to portray himself as the more liberal of the two men \u2014 a claim Pascrell, who represents the neighboring 8th District, vigorously disputes. \"This is really a specious argument. I'm working for the middle class. I'm working for the working poor,\" Pascrell said at the debate. \"That's more important than what the label is on my head.\" Friends With Sharp Elbows The truth is that you have to look pretty closely to find much of a difference in their voting records at all. Both Rothman and Pascrell are seasoned veterans who've represented their districts since 1997. Rothman is 59; Pascrell is 75. Both have shown they still know how to throw a punch. Even political observers like Peter Woolley at Fairleigh Dickinson University in New Jersey were caught off guard by the rough tone of the campaign. \"Everybody has been taken by surprise that these two men have really been very bitter toward each other \u2014 each one very anxious to hold onto his seat in the House of Representatives, and willing to use the sharp elbows to do it,\" says Woolley. Both men are so desperate to grab an advantage, adds Woolley, that they've called in every favor they can from party bigwigs. David Axelrod, a top adviser to President Obama, flew in from Chicago to endorse Rothman at an event last week. \"When people say to you, you need to elect a congressman who's going to be the most effective ally for the president of the United States, I'm here to tell you that that man is Steve Rothman,\" Axelrod told Garden State voters while campaigning with Rothman in Wood-Ridge, N.J. Rothman was one of the first Northeastern Democrats in Congress to support Obama for president, back in 2007. Four years ago, Pascrell backed Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination. And this year, he's lined up the endorsement of former President Bill Clinton, who will campaign for Pascrell later this week and who also recorded a robocall, asking people to vote for Pascrell. Redistricting Dilemma Pascrell and Rothman have represented adjoining districts, but slow population growth caused New Jersey to lose one congressional seat after the last census. Redistricting left Rothman's home in a different district, the state's 5th, which is currently represented by Republican Scott Garrett. But rather than run against Garrett \u2014 who has support from the Tea Party \u2014 Rothman put his house on the market and moved back to Englewood, the city where he was mayor in the 1980s. It's in the newly reconfigured 9th District. Pascrell says Rothman should have taken on the Republican instead. \"He chose to run and hide. He chose to leave and move back into the district that was assigned to me in the process,\" says Pascrell. \"How is that helping the Obama agenda or the Democratic Party? I don't know.\" But Rothman insists he's simply following his constituents into the new district. \"I was born and raised in this district. I was the mayor of Englewood, and practiced law here, and represented this district for the last 16 years. And I live here. So for someone to say this isn't my home district is a little silly,\" Rothman says. On paper, it looks like the new district contains slightly more of Rothman's constituents. He also has more money to spend. But Pascrell has strong support around his hometown of Paterson, where he was mayor in the 1990s. Democratic voter Thomas Lyons of Clifton says this is one choice he wishes he did not have to make. \"It's regrettable that one of them wouldn't choose to take on Mr. Garrett. Nobody has the internal fortitude to go out and challenge the man. And it's a shame that it comes down to two good Democratic members here, Rothman and Pascrell,\" says Lyons. And no matter what happens on Tuesday, one of those members is not going to represent New Jersey in Congress next year.",

            "article_content": "The Obama campaign continues its attack on Mitt Romney's time at the private-equity firm Bain Capital. Over the weekend, Newark, New Jersey, Mayor Cory Booker seemed to veer off the campaign's message. Later, Booker tempered his remarks in a YouTube video. But it didn't take long for the Romney campaign to seize on Booker's comments.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Is it only Tuesday? It's MORNING EDITION, from NPR News. I'm Steve Inskeep. RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: And I'm Renee Montagne. Mitt Romney's time running the private equity firm Bain Capital is now front and center in the 2012 presidential race. The Obama campaign has released ads hitting Romney and Bain for cutting jobs and shutting down companies to reap big profits. The Romney campaign has countered with Bain success stories. Complicating things have been comments by some high profile supporters of Mr. Obama, including Newark Mayor Corey Booker, criticizing the attacks centered on Bain. NPR National Political Correspondent Don Gonyea has more. DON GONYEA, BYLINE: The Bain story gets to the core of Mitt Romney's campaign for the White House, that his business experience means he is far more qualified than the president when it comes to the economy and creating jobs. So with new TV and Web ads doing battle on that topic and with Obama surrogates, such as Mayor Booker, seemingly contradicting the president's own campaign, it's no surprise that Mr. Obama was asked about it at the NATO summit in Chicago yesterday. He said this about his opponent. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: And if the main basis for him suggesting he can do a better job is his track record as the head of a private equity firm, then both the upsides and the downsides are worth examining. GONYEA: An Obama ad released a week ago and immediately started the debate. It featured former steel workers from a Missouri factory that Bain bought. (SOUNDBITE OF POLITICAL ADVERTISEMENT) JOE SOPTIC: They made as much money off it as they could, and they closed it down. They filed for bankruptcy without any concern for the families or the communities. JACK COBB: It was like a vampire. They came in and sucked the life out of us. GONYEA: That prompted Steve Rattner, the Obama administration's former auto czar, to say last week that Bain acted within the rules, and that the ad was unfair.    Then, on Sunday morning, Newark's Mayor Booker was on \"Meet the Press,\" calling the anti-Bain ad, quote, \"nauseating.\" MONTAGNE: By yesterday, Booker was the star of a new Romney web ad. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Have you had enough of President Obama's attacks on free enterprise? His own key supporters have: Democrat Mayor Cory Booker of New Jersey. MAYOR CORY BOOKER: I have to just say from a very personal level, I'm not about to sit here and indict private equity. GONYEA: Since Sunday morning, Booker has been revising his comments. First came a YouTube video in which he says Romney's Bain record is fair game. Then last night, he was on MSNBC. (SOUNDBITE OF MSNBC BROADCAST) BOOKER: Let me be clear: Mitt Romney has made his business record a centerpiece of his campaign. He's talked about himself as a job creator, and therefore, it is reasonable - and, in fact, I encourage it - for the Obama campaign to examine that record and to discuss it. I have no problem with that. GONYEA: There is good reason for the Obama campaign to focus on Bain Capital.    The attack has already been field tested by Newt Gingrich in the South Carolina Republican primary. Longtime Democratic pollster Geoff Garin. GEOFF GARIN: We happened to have polled in South Carolina during that primary, and blue collar and working class voters really took Romney's record at Bain seriously, and it was a factor in their decision to reject him there. GONYEA: Bain Capital certainly has become the issue of the moment in these early days of the general election campaign. It also appears to be one that's not going away.

If elected, France's Socialist presidential challenger, Francois Hollande, says he will pursue a growth-oriented strategy. The possibility that French President Nicolas Sarkozy may lose the presidential election Sunday is making waves across Europe. Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel are the architects of Europe's new fiscal austerity pact. But the man likely to replace Sarkozy has other ideas. Socialist candidate Francois Hollande \u2014 who is favored in opinion polls by several percentage points \u2014 says Europe cannot emerge from the crisis based on austerity alone. Hollande is calling for a rethink, to foster growth strategies. And many across Europe welcome the change a new French president might bring. This year's presidential campaign spawned a huge anti-capitalist backlash. On May Day, the traditional workers holiday, tens of thousands of people took to the streets of Paris to denounce the world of finance \u2014 the bankers, traders and profit-seekers who they say have ruined regular, hard-working people. In a catchy phrase that rhymes in French, protesters chanted, \"There's plenty of money for the people, you'll find it in the CEOs' pockets.\" Socialist Francois Hollande, (left) and France's incumbent president, Nicolas Sarkozy, pose for photos before facing off during a contentious debate Wednesday on national TV.

Opinion polls favor Hollande heading into Sunday's election. Proposing A New Direction This mood was reflected across Europe in similar demonstrations. Many Europeans are also angry about austerity measures squeezing the working class from Athens to Lisbon. After months of painful cuts with nothing to show, many say they feel the path set out by Merkel and Sarkozy, often referred to as Merkozy, is the wrong one. Gwenael Braz, 30, carried a Greek flag during the Paris march. On his T-shirt the word Merkozy had a giant X through it. Braz says the people of Greece and other countries have suffered from their austerity, and French voters will change that on Sunday. \"When you vote as a French, you have more power within Europe than when you vote as a Greek,\" he says. \"We have to change the Merkozy things. We can put Sarkozy out, a Greek cannot.\" In a contentious presidential debate Wednesday night, Hollande accused Sarkozy of selling out French interests to German demands for austerity. Hollande said he will push to re-negotiate the austerity pact to include proposals to boost growth and job creation. \"My obligation, if I become president, is to give another direction to Europe than the one that is being forced upon us today,\" he said. Hollande went on to say that he has noticed a change of mindset in Europe since he began talking about growth. Even though Spain, the Netherlands and Italy have conservative governments, they're all talking about a different approach now, Hollande said. Weighing A Europe-Wide Growth Strategy Analysts say opposition to the Merkozy austerity plan is growing across Europe, and many now view a possible Hollande election as a way to shift the dynamics. \"It's something that in Italy is felt very, very deeply,\" says Beppe Severgnini, a financial columnist with the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera. \"Someone who thinks that growth is more important than austerity and can join forces to tell Merkel that it's not enough to say cut, cut, cut, and we really need to grow.\" Matthieu Pigasse, chief executive of Lazard Financial Advisory in France, says the change is not just political. \"As the political discourse changes in Europe, we are also seeing the perception of the financial markets evolve. The markets now want to see a growth-based strategy adopted,\" says Pigasse, who is also advising the Greek government on how to tackle its financial woes. But Tomasz Michalski, a professor at HEC, one of France's top business schools, says he doesn't believe a Europe-wide growth strategy can work. \"The reasons for the current malaise in different countries are completely different. So it's not clear that having a growth pact will address all the problems of all the countries at the same time,\" he says. \"And basically a lot of countries want these growth policies to avoid painful reforms.\" The austerity pact pushed through by Merkozy still has to be ratified by parliaments in many countries, including Germany and France. Sunday's French presidential runoff may determine which course Europe will follow.",

Both candidates have been trying to appeal to supporters of France's far-right leader Marine Le Pen, who came in third place in the first round of balloting held last month. Sarkozy, from the center-right, finished in second place, with Socialist candidate Francois Hollande taking first with nearly 29 percent of the vote. While Le Pen's third-place finish ended her run, it was the far right's highest score ever in a presidential election. Big Gains For Far Right The National Front party leader made big gains in many French regions. Her supporters are considered to be largely working class or agrarian. That makes the winegrowing region of Burgundy prime Le Pen territory. In the tiny village of Chambolle Musigny, a table of vintners toast their centuries-old way of life and Le Pen's success. With almost 20 percent of the vote, she did nearly twice as well as her father did in 2002 when he shocked the nation by making it into the second-round runoff. Winegrower Remy Boursot says there are two main reasons why more people are voting Le Pen. \"Europe and immigration. As a winegrower, it's Europe that dictates my life. We've lost our sovereignty, and this has killed our small businesses and artisans. We have to get out of the euro currency. And with unemployment on the rise, we hardly need mass immigration,\" said Boursot. \"Yes, people are waking up.\" Francois Fabin, a day laborer who picks Boursot's grapes, puts it more bluntly. \"If you go to the hospital in the town of Dijon, you see all the African women who come here to have their babies,\" said Fabin. \"We're working to pay for the rest of the world. We can't do it anymore, and the National Front says stop!\" Despite the tranquil beauty of Burgundy's stone villages and church spires, and the orderliness of neat rows of vines stitched across its hillsides, all is not well here. This presidential election has laid bare deep French fears over issues such as globalization, economic austerity measures and national identity. In the blue-collar Burgundy town of Montbard, a metal works factory supplies parts for the powerful French nuclear industry. With jobs to be had and virtually no foreigners, local newspaper editor David Regazzoni says he can't figure out why the people of Montbard are increasingly voting for the far right. \"Perhaps they are afraid. Afraid to lose what they have \u2014 to lose their job, they are afraid by Europe, they are afraid of globalization, even in rural country like this,\" Regazzoni said. Frederic Ravenet, a local Socialist official, says the far right's vote here is no threat yet \u2014 but their arguments worry him. \"Their talk is very aggressive toward foreigners, the homeless, anyone living at the margins of society. And I think hiding behind this kind of a debate is not very healthy for democracy,\" Ravenet said. Betting On The Far Right Hollande, the favorite, called the National Front's vote results an expression of \"social anger.\" All across Burgundy, Socialist Party volunteers have been going door to door in an attempt to bring a few of Le Pen's 6 million disgruntled voters back to the mainstream. Sarkozy desperately needs Le Pen's voters if he is to beat Hollande, and at a recent rally in the Burgundy capital of Dijon, he went after them. But the president's heightened right-wing rhetoric on immigration and security has made some in his center-right party uncomfortable. Nonna Mayer, a specialist on the far right, says Sarkozy is taking a gamble. \"It's a very dangerous bet, because by doing that, he's going to lose the center-right voters who are kind of shocked by the tone of his campaign. And it won't necessarily win Marine Le Pen voters, because as her father used to say, 'The voters would prefer the original to the copy,' And also, in a way it legitimizes the positions of Marine Le Pen,\" Mayer said. In a recent television interview, Le Pen said both Sarkozy and Hollande had missed the point, saying, \"My supporters didn't cast their votes out of anger and suffering. They voted to join me.\" At a May Day rally in Paris Tuesday, Le Pen said she could not endorse a candidate and would cast a blank ballot. She added her supporters could make their own choices.",

            "article_content": "One day after President Obama delivered a speech on the U.S. economy in Lorain County, Ohio, Mitt Romney went there Thursday to respond to the president. Romney is chasing the president to accuse the incumbent of failing to live up to his campaign promises.  LYNN NEARY, HOST: It's MORNING EDITION from NPR News. I'm Lynn Neary. Renee Montagne is on assignment. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: And I'm Steve Inskeep, good morning. Lorain County, Ohio is a fading industrial community outside of Cleveland, and it's suddenly in the spotlight. President Obama campaigned there on Tuesday. Mitt Romney followed with a speech there yesterday. As NPR's Ari Shapiro reports, Romney is chasing the president to accuse him of failing to live up to his campaign promises. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: A thick layer of gray dust covers everything at this gypsum factory. It's as fine as powdered sugar, and it looks as though it has not been disturbed since the factory shut down, just a few weeks after President Obama campaigned here in 2008. Now the political slogans and the klieg lights are back, for a different presidential candidate promising jobs. MITT ROMNEY: I can tell you I will use every ounce of my energy, not to improve my golf handicap, but instead to go to work to help the American people go to work. SHAPIRO: This factory closed under President Bush - a name Romney almost never utters. Romney said while it's not President Obama's fault that the plant shut down, it is his fault that the place remains closed today. ROMNEY: This factory used to have people working in it. The people who are no longer working here have families. They used to be able shop and go out to restaurants for dinner, now and then, or go to a movie. And they're not able to do those things like they were before, so those other enterprises had to lay off people. SHAPIRO: Romney pointed out that President Obama was in this part of Ohio just one day before. In that speech at a community college, the president said he and Republicans have different visions for America. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: In this country, prosperity does not trickle down; prosperity grows from the bottom up. And it grows from a strong middle-class out. SHAPIRO: Romney said this will indeed be a choice between competing visions for America. ROMNEY: If you want to know where his vision leads, open your eyes, 'cause we've been living it for the last three years. It leads to lost jobs, lost homes, lost dreams. It's time to end that vision and have a vision of growth, and jobs and economic vitality. (SOUNDBITE OF CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) SHAPIRO: This part of the country will be crucial in the presidential race. No Republican in history has won the White House without carrying Ohio. In the primary here, Romney vastly outspent Rick Santorum and barely squeaked out a win - so he has work to do. Both Romney and the president have a hard time winning over the white, working-class voters who make up a large part of the state's population. People like John Baribak. He's lived in Lorain his whole life and recently retired from Sears after 40 years. He remembers when this town had a shipyard, a car factory, a steel plant. JOHN BARIBAK: We had 12 to 15,000 guys building Fords at two plants here. SHAPIRO: That's all been gone for years. BARIBAK: Sad. It really is. I mean I grew up across the street from the steel plant when there was 15,000 people working there. My dad worked there. I worked there when I got out of the Air Force. It's just sad. SHAPIRO: Pam Malcolm is a native, too. She works as a cashier in nearby Elyria. PAM MALCOLM: I have seen people with college degrees and they cannot find work. I mean they're working as bartenders and, you know, some are waitresses, some are waiters. It's bad. It's bad. It's really bad. SHAPIRO: Although Lorain County is suffering, the State of Ohio is actually bouncing back. The unemployment rate here is 7.6 percent. That's lower than the national rate of 8.2 percent. The state's Republican governor, John Kasich, talks up Ohio's recovery nearly every day. Kasich endorsed Romney yesterday. The Ohio governor's sunny outlook contrasts with Romney's message that things are still tough. After the speech, Romney advisor Eric Fehrnstrom said he doesn't worry that an improving economy will undercut Romney's message. ERIC FEHRNSTROM: If you're out of work or if you're struggling to work two jobs to make ends meet, or if you've become so discouraged that you've stopped looking at all for work, it doesn't seem like a recovery at all. SHAPIRO: For most of this week, Romney has used President Obama as his travel agent. On Wednesday, Romney was in Charlotte, North Carolina, overlooking the stadium where Mr. Obama will accept the Democratic nomination in a few months. Yesterday, the Republican followed the Democrat to Ohio. And today their paths diverge. Mitt Romney is focusing on Latino voters at campaign events in Arizona, while Mr. Obama is back at the White House. Ari Shapiro, NPR News, Cleveland, Ohio. Copyright \u00a9 2012 NPR.

GOP front-runner Mitt Romney is matching President Obama's recent appearance in the key swing state of Ohio while intensifying his rhetoric, attacking the president's record on the economy. For the second day in a row, Romney used his location on the campaign trail to send a message. On Wednesday, the GOP front-runner visited Charlotte, N.C., offering a \"prebuttal\" to the president's speech there later this summer at the Democratic National Convention. Today, Romney spoke at a closed gypsum factory in Lorain, Ohio, the day after the president visited a community college there. Speaking in front of a sign reading, \"Obama isn't working,\" Romney said: \"This factory is empty. It was closed in 2008 at the beginning of the economic downturn. Had the president's economic plans worked ... it'd be open by now. But it's still empty. And it underscores the failure of this president's policies with regards to getting this economy going again.\" During the 2008 election, Obama spoke from the same factory, promising to create jobs. Weeks later, the factory closed while President George W. Bush was still in office. While Obama wasn't in the White House when the plant closed, Romney says it remains shuttered because of the president's inability to reignite the troubled economy. \"This president has failed by his own measure,\" Romney said. \"This is a president who'd like to run on rhetoric. We instead are going to insist that he will run on record, and that record is a record of failure.\" The stop is part of a larger strategy by the Romney campaign to, literally, follow the president across the country, attacking Obama's economic record along the way. NPR's Ari Shapiro, who was in Lorain on Thursday, says on All Things Considered that while Obama won Ohio by 4 percentage points in 2008, it's expected to be a tougher fight this year. Shapiro tells host Melissa Block the candidates are trying to best each other in conveying the message to working-class voters, \"I understand you. The other guy is out of touch.\" Both Romney and Obama have faced challenges connecting with working-class voters in key swing states. One statistic that may be in Obama's favor in Ohio is the unemployment rate, which has dropped from a high of 10.6 percent in January 2010 to 7.6 percent this past February \u2014 well below the current national rate of 8.2 percent.",

Mitt Romney and Rick Santorum have been fighting it out in Wisconsin for the past week. And Tuesday night they'll see the results of their labors. Republicans will also cast votes Tuesday in Maryland and Washington, D.C., primaries, though the candidates have not spent much time there. In all three contests, polls show Romney with a wide lead. Yet Santorum continues to campaign as relentlessly as ever. On Tuesday's Morning Edition, NPR's Ari Shapiro and David Welna filed reports from the trail. Traveling with Romney in Milwaukee, Shapiro notes that Romney has been on a Great Lakes winning streak. He carried his birth state of Michigan, squeaked by in Ohio and buried his opponents in Illinois. At an oil company in Milwaukee on Monday, he urged Wisconsin voters to help him continue the pattern. Shapiro reports that Romney did not mention Santorum or the other Republicans in the race and instead delivered a relentless economic message, attacking President Obama on every front. Romney also talked about his wife, Ann, and their 42 years together more than he typically does, Shapiro notes. This could be part an effort, he says, to win over female voters. A new poll shows women overwhelmingly leaning toward President Obama in the general election. Traveling with Santorum in Ripon, Wis., Monday, David Welna reports that Santorum addressed a crowd of several dozen supporters and urged them to take the day off to vote Tuesday. \"You have the opportunity to shock the world. Everybody expects that, with all the establishment and all of the media singing this song about 'well, this race is over, it's over, it's over.' Less than half the delegates have been voted for. We're not even at halftime in this race,\" Santorum said. Yet as Welna reports, Santorum acknowledges that he has been outspent by Romney and that Wisconsin has been an uphill struggle: \"Santorum is telling his supporters that an expected low turnout in this open primary means each vote will count more today. He's gone bowling, eaten cheese curds and quaffed beer here to bolster his image of a regular guy, the kind rural and working class Wisconsinites can trust. Today's vote could be the most crucial test yet of his viability.\" Santorum's national campaign manager, Michael Biundo, tells Welna that although polls show his candidate trailing Romney by seven to 10 points, \"I think we're ... going to do well.\" As Welna notes, however, Santorum isn't sticking around the state to find out. He's planning an election-night rally in his home state of Pennsylvania, girding for its primary on April 24.",

At a United Auto Workers union hall, he gave the first in a planned series of speeches in states designed to frame the Obama-Biden re-election rational. Afterward, he stopped by a Jeep factory to shake hands with workers at the shift change.  ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: From NPR News, this ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. I'm Robert Siegel. MELISSA BLOCK, HOST: And I'm Melissa Block. To the campaign trail now. And with Republicans still wrestling over a presidential nominee, the Obama campaign is framing its arguments for the fall. Vice President Joe Biden took the new message to a union hall in Toledo today. He gave the first in a series of re-election campaign speeches, then stopped by an auto factory to shake hands at the shift change. NPR's Scott Horsley went with Biden to Ohio. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: The speech had all the trappings of a general election campaign: rousing Springsteen music, waving blue placards, and chants for the incumbents of Four More Years. (SOUNDBITE OF CHANTING CROWD) VICE PRESIDENT JOSEPH BIDEN: Thank you. HORSLEY: Vice President Biden told members of Toledo's UAW Local 12 there's no better example of the choice facing voters, than the way the two parties approached the auto rescue in 2009. Faced with the likely collapse of General Motors and Chrysler, just months after taking office, Biden says President Obama didn't flinch. BIDEN: He knew that resurrecting the industry wasn't going to be popular. It was absolutely clear in every bit of polling data. And he knew he was taking a chance. But he believed. He wasn't going to give up on a million jobs and on the iconic industry America invented. At least he wasn't going to give it up without a real fight. HORSLEY: The decision to prop up the two companies with taxpayer dollars remains controversial, even though GM and Chrysler are profitable again, selling cars and hiring workers. The leading Republican presidential candidates say the federal government should have left the companies alone. Biden defends the president's decision as the right one for American workers. BIDEN: He made the tough call. And the verdict is in. President Obama was right and they were dead wrong. (SOUNDBITE OF CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) HORSLEY: The auto industry has added more than 200,000 workers since GM and Chrysler emerged from bankruptcy. And auto-intensive states, like Ohio and Michigan, have seen some of the country's biggest job gains. Ohio's unemployment rate fell to 7.7 percent in January, more than half a point better than the national average. Marcia Young says she owes her job on Toledo's Jeep assembly line to the government's willingness to step in. And she's not the only one. MARCIA YOUNG: If it wouldn't have been for them saving us, Toledo would have been a ghost town. And it's not just us. It's all the companies that depend on us. The smaller companies that make parts for us. And right down to the little restaurants that we go to. And even my Avon lady - I wouldn't be able to buy Avon from her if I wasn't working. You know, it's just little things like that that's the ripple effect. HORSLEY: Biden tried to spin the auto rescue into a larger story about the proper role for government in the economy. Middle class families were getting squeezed long before the Great Recession. And the Obama administration's strategy to address that includes greater access to health care, more help paying for college, and efforts to promote good-paying jobs in manufacturing. The average auto industry job in Ohio pays about $54,000. Republican presidential hopefuls want a smaller role for government and lower taxes. Biden argues that's the wrong course. BIDEN: If you give any one of these guys the keys to the White House, they will bankrupt the middle class again. (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER AND APPALUSE) BIDEN: Look, the president and I have a fundamental commitment to dealing the middle class back into the American economy that they've been dealt out of for so long. And ultimately, that's what this election is all about. It's a choice - a clear choice. HORSLEY: It's no accident Biden is giving this first big campaign speech in Ohio - a perennial battleground. Four years ago, he and Mr. Obama won the state by five points. But they lost working class white voters by 10 points. And part of Biden's job is to limit further erosion in those numbers. With his blue-collar background and aw-shucks manner, Biden is sometimes a more effective union hall campaigner than the president himself. Introduced this morning as the son of an auto dealer, Biden made it clear his dad merely managed the dealership, he didn't own it. He said his family proudly drives the Jeeps made here in Toledo. And they're in good company. Jeeps are selling fast these days, and Chrysler employees are working 60-hour weeks to keep up with demand. Scott Horsley, NPR News, Toledo. Copyright \u00a9 2012 NPR.

            "article_content": "On Thursday, Vice President Joe Biden travels to Toledo, Ohio, where he'll give the first of four \"framing speeches\" for the campaign. He'll be talking about what the auto rescue means for that state, and its  industrial workforce.  RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: This is MORNING EDITION from NPR News. I'm Renee Montagne. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: And I'm Steve Inskeep. Good morning. Countless supporters of President Obama got a text message yesterday. The message offered free Obama/Biden bumper stickers, one of many signs - large and small - that President Obama is intensifying his campaign for re-election. Another sign comes today as Vice President Joe Biden gives the first in a series of campaign speeches. He is expected to deliver encores to his 2008 campaign role as the Obama campaign's ambassador to the middle-class. NPR's Scott Horsley reports. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: The vice president is speaking today at a union hall in Ohio. He'll be talking about what the auto rescue means for that state and its industrial workforce. He'll be introduced by Shelly Whitson. She's worked at the Jeep plant in Toledo for almost 30 years. SHELLY WHITSON: It really is an honor for me to meet Joe Biden. I mean, excuse me, Vice President Joe Biden. HORSLEY: It's that familiarity that the White House is banking on. Even though he's the vice president, for a lot of voters like Whitson, Biden is just Joe. WHITSON: He seems to be just a down-to-Earth guy. Like he's one of us. You know, you kind of think of him that way. One of the kind of guys you could have a beer with. HORSLEY: Never mind that the Biden's a teetotaler. His everyman persona and glad-handing style help the vice president connect to white working-class voters in a way that President Obama does not. The Democratic ticket fared poorly with these voters four years ago. So Biden will be on the road a lot this year, trying to hold the line in swing states like Ohio, Pennsylvania and New Hampshire. Political scientist Paul Beck of Ohio State University says Biden played the same role in 2008. PAUL BECK: He was much better at working the union halls. Not that President Obama at the time was bad at doing that, but Biden really connected with union workers, with blue collar workers, with, you know, just kind of average middle-class voters. HORSLEY: Biden told a campaign crowd in New Hampshire last month he's worn that middle-class label proudly, throughout his political career. VICE PRESIDENT JOSEPH BIDEN: Initially, in the '70s when I got to the Senate and I was a middle class guy, it was really a polite way of saying he ain't very sophisticated. (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER) BIDEN: That's what it is. Most people when they talk to you about middle class, they think that somehow you're kind of pedestrian. I am middle class. It didn't take me long to figure out who I was and where I came from. HORSLEY: Even though Biden earned a six-figure income as a senator, he routinely ranked last in the chamber in personal wealth. He notes that he borrowed against his house to help put his children through college. Biden peppers his speeches with homespun stories about his parents' wisdom and worries. And when he mis-speaks, which he does with some regularity, the embarrassment doesn't seem to last long. BIDEN: No one's ever accused me of saying anything I didn't mean. They pointed out, though, I tend to say all that I mean. (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER) BIDEN: That's sometimes a problem. Sometimes a problem. HORSLEY: The president once joked that he was going to try to go off the teleprompter more often, while trying to get Biden to stay on it. The vice president can be long-winded. But in summing up the administration's case for re-election, he's bumper-sticker brief. BIDEN: When anybody asks you about us: Osama bin Laden's dead and General Motors is alive. (SOUNDBITE OF CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) HORSLEY: Today's speech focuses on the second half of that argument. The campaign notes 120,000 people in Ohio are directly employed by the auto industry. Political scientist Beck says many more have benefited indirectly from the recovery of GM and Chrysler. BECK: It would have been devastating to the Ohio economy had any one of the Detroit automakers gone under as a result of a failure to support them in, you know, in the rescue attempts. HORSLEY: Jeep plant worker Shelly Whitson sees the automakers' turnaround in more personal terms. She recalls the two months she was laid off before Chrysler emerged from bankruptcy. WHITSON: When you have to start thinking of calling unemployment and that you might not have a job, that is one of the scariest feelings - to think that you could lose everything that you've worked for 29 years. HORSLEY: Three years later, Whitson's working six days a week to keep up with demand for the popular Jeep Wrangler. She's happy with the overtime. And while polls suggest the auto rescue is still controversial, Whitson says a lot of people in Toledo are sold. This town depends on us. The stores, the little grocery stores, the bars, the restaurants. They're glad to see us working. Believe me. And that's exactly the message the vice president hopes to send to middle class voters in Ohio and other swing states around the country. Scott Horsley, NPR News. Copyright \u00a9 2012 NPR.

The former Massachusetts governor has  skeptics in the Deep South.\n                \n                    \n                    Rogelio Solis/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney speaks at the Mississippi Farmers Market in Jackson, Miss., on Friday. The former Massachusetts governor has  skeptics in the Deep South. Mitt Romney picked up some support in Saturday's contests, but there may be trouble lurking for him in the near future as the GOP race moves to the Deep  South. Despite his second-place finish in Kansas, Romney scored victories Saturday in caucuses in Guam, the Northern  Marianas and the U.S. Virgin Islands. He also won county conventions in Wyoming. Tuesday's primaries are in Alabama and Mississippi, and the reddest of states are proving to be a tough sell for the former Massachusetts governor. He's trying his best to connect with the Republican base. When In Mississippi... On this swing through Dixie, Romney seems to have picked up a new twang, greeting crowds with \"Morning, y'all!\" He's also trying a new diet of biscuits and grits. \"Some of us have been saying 'y'all' all our lives, and you know it,\" says attorney David Allen of Biloxi, Miss. \"But you take somebody from Massachusetts who says 'yawl,' you know he is not from here.\" Allen still hasn't decided who he'll vote for on Tuesday, but Romney's not in the mix. \"To me, too much of what he does is scripted, and I'm just not real comfortable with that,\" he says. The Romney campaign is doing what it can to overcome the perception that the candidate is out of touch by lining up bona fide Southerners to vouch for him. He has the endorsement of Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant, and Bob Riley, the popular former governor of Alabama. At a tractor company in Birmingham on Friday, Randy Owen of the country music band Alabama opened a rally for Romney. Owen talked about his working-class roots and encouraged his native state to support Romney. \"I love this man, and I love his family, and I love what he stands for,\" he said. Southern Obstacles Grady Thornton of Center Point, Ala., was in the crowd. The Romney delegate says the issue is not whether Romney can connect with working class voters. \"I'm not looking for somebody to play golf with. My wife is not gonna have tea and tennis with Ann. I'm looking for a leader,\" he says. Thornton likes Romney's executive credentials. He acknowledges the obstacles Romney faces in the South, particularly with Christian conservatives troubled by Romney's Mormon faith. \"I'm also a Protestant, and when my Southern Baptist friends ask me about his faith, I remind them that the last two presidents we had that had some association with the Southern Baptist faith was Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter,\" Thornton says, \"and I ask, 'Well, how did that work out for you?' \" Despite Thornton's argument, religious voters in the South generally line up with one of Romney's rivals: former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum or former House Speaker Newt Gingrich. Romney isn't connecting with the Republican base here, says Natalie Davis, a political scientist and pollster at Birmingham-Southern  College. \"When you ask voters, 'Does he share your values? Is he one of us?' You don't get a resounding yes when they're talking about Mitt Romney,\" Davis says. Voting Against Obama Even if he doesn't win Alabama or Mississippi Tuesday, or Louisiana later in the month, Davis says that doesn't mean Romney will have trouble here in the fall, should he pick up the GOP nomination. \"The best thing Romney has going for him in November in the South is his opponent,\" she says. \"There is so much animosity and visceral negative feelings about President Obama that Romney wins in a walk this November in the Deep South.\" Retired real estate broker and Gingrich supporter Dodie White of Montrose, Ala., is one of those voters. \"Honestly, I don't care who runs against Obama, I'm gonna vote for them ... I don't care which of the three get there,\" she says. \"I will vote for them to get him out of the White House.\" Authentic \"y'all\" or not, even a candidate perceived as out of touch with average folks isn't likely to change a red state to blue.",

            "article_content": "In Ohio, Rep. Marcy Kaptur of Toledo won the Democratic primary against Rep. Dennis Kucinich of Cleveland after the state's 9th Congressional District was redraw. Now she's turning her sights on Republican primary winner Samuel Wurzelbacher, who's known as Joe the Plumber.  RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: One of the out-sized names in Congress will not be back next year. Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich was defeated in Ohio's primary this past Tuesday. Another Congress member, Marcy Kaptur beat Kucinich for the Democratic nomination. And Marcy Kaptur now turns her sights to the November election where she'll challenge a Republican opponent with a familiar face and a famous moniker, Joe the Plumber. From member station WKSU Kevin Niedermier reports. KEVIN NIEDERMIER, BYLINE: Kaptur and Kucinich battled each other in the primary, because their districts were redrawn, putting them in competition. Now Kaptur, the senior Democrat on the powerful House Appropriations Committee, takes her reputation for bringing home federal dollars into a face-off with Sam Wurzelbacher. He became a celebrity in 2008, when he questioned candidate Barack Obama about his tax plan during a campaign stop. SAM WURZELBACHER: Your new tax plan is going to tax me more. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Well, here's what's going to happen. NIEDERMIER: After that event, Wurzelbacher picked up the nickname Joe the Plumber, and reminds people of that working class status by wearing a plaid flannel shirt, work pants, and boots at many campaign appearances. He reached the general election by defeating auctioneer Steven Kraus in Tuesday's Republican primary. The district he and Kaptur are trying to win was designed by Ohio Republican lawmakers to be heavily Democratic to protect Republican chances in other parts of the state. Kaptur expects to win, because Wurzelbacher is so out of step with her constituents. REPRESENTATIVE MARCY KAPTUR: Well, you know, I think if you look at the primary results, he had a very, very tough primary campaign. He barely made it thru. So I think he's going to have his own issues dealing with the electorate as he moves forward. And I think the nature of the District is quite different than his value set. NIEDERMIER: But Wurtzelbacher disagrees, that being a political minority in the Democratic district is a disadvantage. WURZELBACHER: Democrat, Republican, you know, it's something that the media uses to try to divide us as Americans. I live in a very large, obviously Democratic community, lot of union members, all really good friends of mine. And, you know, we agree on a lot of things, and ultimately what it comes down to we want jobs, we want security, we want stability. So that's how I plan to get my message out there, is let them know I'm not working for the Republican Party or Republicans, I'm working for the American people, and that includes all of us. NIEDERMIER: Wurzelbacher calls himself a conservative, and campaigns on lower taxes, protecting the Constitution and strengthening national security. And he was endorsed by former Republican presidential candidate, Herman Cain. In the primary, Wurzelbacher spent just under $60,000, and will likely be heavily out-spent by Kaptur in the general election. For NPR News, I'm Kevin Niedermier. Copyright \u00a9 2012 NPR.

            "article_content": "Ten states voted in Super Tuesday's primaries and caucuses. At the end of the night, the map was a jigsaw puzzle of wins for Mitt Romney, Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich. The most hard-fought state was Ohio, and Romney managed to squeak out a win.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: It's MORNING EDITION from NPR News. I'm Steve Inskeep. RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: And I'm Renee Montagne. It was the biggest day yet in the Republican presidential race. Mitt Romney hoped that Super Tuesday would reinforce his frontrunner status. And to some degree it did. He won six of the 10 states, including the most populous and hotly contested state, Ohio. The win in Ohio was by the narrowest of margins, though, and there was enough good news for Romney's rivals to keep them in the running as well. So even in victory, the Romney campaign could not dispel lingering doubts about his candidacy. NPR's Ari Shapiro was at Romney headquarters in Boston. ARI SHAPIRO, BYLINE: An election night as big as Super Tuesday requires an election party that's bigger than normal too. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG) SHAPIRO: No DJ at Mitt Romney's rally in Boston. A live band played pop hits like \"Party in the USA,\" \"Don't Stop Believing,\" and \"Play that Funky Music White Boy.\" The crowd shouted: Go, Mitt, go. GROUP: Go, Mitt, go. Go, Mitt, go. Go, Mitt, go. SHAPIRO: Their exuberance belied the mixed results streaming in on giant screens. Early on, Newt Gingrich won Georgia. Rick Santorum took Tennessee and Oklahoma. Romney won Massachusetts, where he used to be governor, neighboring Vermont, and Virginia, where only he and Ron Paul were on the ballot. Yet Romney focused almost all of his energy in the last week on Ohio. And by the time Romney took the podium in Boston, that state still hung in the balance. MITT ROMNEY: Your support means everything to Ann and me. And I'm not going to let you down. I'm going to get this nomination. (SOUNDBITE OF CHEERING) SHAPIRO: Romney fought hard for Ohio's blue collar working class voters - people like retired steelworker Joe Buckmelter, who voted in Steubenville. JOE BUCKMELTER: I actually do like all the candidates. I wish we could take a compilation of all three. Put Mitt Romney's \u2013 I think his forthrightness, Rick Santorum's genuineness, and Newt Gingrich's fire. But I think in the final analysis that Mitt's going to be the strongest. SHAPIRO: In the last week, Romney shrank Rick Santorum's wide lead in Ohio. He did it partly by outspending his rivals by a 4-1 margin. At the election night party in Boston, Margaret Klingmeyer worried that even a deluge of cash could not wholly sink Romney's rivals. MARGARET KLINGMEYER: That concerns me, but hopefully as it narrows down, he'll be able to concentrate. And I think he's the real leader. SHAPIRO: Ohio will be an important swing state in the general election. And the fact that Romney barely squeaked out a win there revives old questions about whether he can unify the Republican Party behind him. Romney prefers to play down the symbolism and focus on cold hard math. ROMNEY: Tonight we're doing some counting. We're counting up the delegates for the convention, and it looks good. And we're counting down the days until November, and that looks even better. SHAPIRO: Focusing on delegates lets Romney emphasize what the campaign describes as the other candidates' disorganization. Romney staffers are quick to point out that Rick Santorum did not qualify to compete for all of Ohio's delegates. Santorum failed to get on the Virginia ballot at all. Romney campaign strategist Mark DeMoss says while it may be tempting to glorify a scrappy grassroots campaign like Santorum's, Democrats would crush that sort of operation in November. MARK DEMOSS: We're not going against a scrappy pick-yourself-up-from-your-bootstraps kind of campaign if we run against President Obama. So I think the organization is critically important. It's important to line up endorsements, to raise money, to turn volunteers out. BORIS MAKARENKO: And he says Santorum has shown an inability to do that. The flip side of that argument is that the Romney campaign lost key states despite the endorsements, the money, the volunteers, and the infrastructure. In Boston last night, Romney said there will be good days and bad days ahead. ROMNEY: Tomorrow we wake up and we start again. And the next day we'll do the same. And so we'll go day by day, step by step, door by door, heart to heart. SHAPIRO: For the next few contests, the bad days may outnumber the good ones for Romney. The next states to vote include Mississippi, Alabama, and Kansas, places with the kinds of religious, socially conservative voters that Romney has struggled to win over. Yet on a Super Tuesday that produced mixed results for him, there was one thing Romney could be unequivocally happy about. Last night was his first night home in two months. He said he was looking forward to a homemade dinner of chicken marsala. Ari Shapiro, NPR News, Boston. Copyright \u00a9 2012 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Ohio is widely considered Super Tuesday's biggest prize.\n                \n                    \n                    Michael Reynolds /EPA /Landov\n                    \n                \nhide caption Mitt Romney engaged in a last bout of campaigning in Youngstown, Ohio, on Monday. Ohio is widely considered Super Tuesday's biggest prize. Super Tuesday 2012 is finally here, with Republican presidential preference contests \u2014 a mix of primaries and caucuses \u2014 occurring in 10 states from sea to shining sea. While the 2012 race for the GOP nomination likely won't be over by Wednesday morning, it could seem far closer to being so, especially if Mitt Romney sweeps contests everywhere but, say, Georgia, where the former congressman from the Peach State, Newt Gingrich, is expected to have a good night. Even if he doesn't take all of Tuesday's contests, it's still thought that Romney will add more of the 437 delegates up for grabs in the 10 states to his count than will his rivals, Rick Santorum, the latest not-Romney to give him a scare, Gingrich and Rep. Ron Paul. In a race where the first candidate to reach 1,144 delegates wins the nomination, Romney starts the day with the wind at his back. His superior organization and money meant he got on the ballot pretty much everywhere. Only he and Paul are on the ballot in Virginia, for instance. Meanwhile, the complicated delegate-allocation process means he can add to his overall total even in states he loses. In any event, there will be a lot of moving parts on Super Tuesday. But here are some of the most important pieces to keep an eye on. Ohio \u2014 All eyes will be on the Buckeye State (66 delegates), which is widely viewed as the grandest of all of Super Tuesday's prizes because of its symbolism. No Republican has ever made it to the White House without winning Ohio in a general election, and winning its primary will certainly boost the victor's argument that he can keep it out of President Obama's column in November. The latest polls suggest Romney and Santorum are now tied in Ohio, with Santorum losing what once was a double-digit lead. The momentum there has clearly shifted to Romney. That's bad news for Santorum, since he has staked his claim to the GOP nomination on his appeal to working-class voters in the industrial Midwest. If Santorum wins, he lives to fight another day. If the former U.S. senator from neighboring Pennsylvania loses, he may fight on but likely in a cause that would seem increasingly doomed. A Romney win in Ohio, after his narrow victory in Michigan  last week, would increase the former Massachusetts governor's \"inevitability\" quotient. The South \u2014 Newt Gingrich should easily win big in his native Georgia (76 delegates), which will likely be enough motivation to keep him slogging along for the foreseeable future. Not everyone buys into the concept that Georgia is so predictable. Middlebury College political scientist Matthew Dickinson thinks Georgia actually is a bigger deal than Ohio. Still, if anyone not named Newt wins Georgia or even comes close, that would be perceived as the upset of the evening. But, again, the state is seen as Gingrich's to lose. Which is why Tennessee (58 delegates) looms so large. Romney has yet to prove he can win in the South, the region that has been a Republican stronghold since the mid-1960s. If Romney can win in Tennessee \u2014 and the latest polls show him essentially tied with Santorum there \u2014 that would give him the Southern street cred he has until now lacked. For this reason, Josh Putnam, the political scientist who runs the Frontloading HQ blog, calls Tennessee the \"new hotness.\" Delegates \u2014 The Republican race has become a delegate chase at this point, with all four remaining GOP candidates \u2014 and especially the Romney and Santorum campaigns \u2014 arguing in recent days that all that really matters is who is adding to their delegate totals. Because of how delegates are awarded, Romney could lose the popular vote in Ohio and elsewhere and still capture enough delegates to significantly pad his totals. Romney got an assist from Santorum and Gingrich, whose seat-of-the-pants organizations failed to qualify for the ballot in Virginia or in all of Ohio's congressional districts. Romney has the most delegates at this point, though, amazingly, no one is certain exactly how many he has. By NPR's count, which includes only those delegates unequivocally committed to a candidate through the first ballot at the GOP convention, he has 118 delegates, while Gingrich has 29, Santorum has 17 and Paul 8. Some counts have Romney at 180. It's all because of uncertainties and disputes as to how delegates are being awarded. In a word, it's ridiculous. While the exact number of delegates may be in dispute, the relative positions of the candidates based on rough numbers are clearer. Romney has a commanding lead going into Super Tuesday. The question is, will anything that happens Tuesday change that? Right now, the smart money says that's unlikely. Caucuses -- As Micah Cohen at the FiveThirtyEight blog reminds us, the caucus states of Alaska, Idaho and North Dakota shouldn't be discounted even though they haven't gotten the attention from the media or pollsters that the primary states have gotten. They have 87 delegates among them. As Cohen writes: \"In 2008, Barack Obama's wins in the caucus states on Super Tuesday helped him to win more delegates from the evening, and turned what was initially perceived as a relatively poor performance for him into one that gave him some degree of momentum.\" But again in the caucus states, Romney appears to be in solid position. Idaho, with its significant Mormon population, is part of the Mormon Corridor of the West, and Romney has done well in other states with large populations of his co-religionists, like Nevada and Arizona. Meanwhile, while Romney won the Alaska caucus four years ago, that was before the Tea Party existed. And Paul, who has appeal to Tea Party voters, is the only GOP presidential candidate to make the physical trek to Alaska.  So he conceivably could pull off a win there or in North Dakota.",

            "article_content": "In the Michigan Republican primary Tuesday, Mitt Romney had a near-death experience, but he squeaked out a narrow victory over Rick Santorum. That, says veteran Republican strategist Ed Rogers, has calmed some of the anxiety in Republican circles about Romney's strength as a general election candidate. \"Mitt Romney did what he needed to do to give more certainty and more clarity to the race. He dodged a bullet; it was an ugly win,\" Rogers says. \"It's not over. Santorum is still very competitive.\" Romney is still a fragile front-runner, but a win is a win, says Republican consultant Whit Ayres. \"Whenever Mitt Romney's back is to the wall and he absolutely has to win, he has come through so far \u2014 first in Florida, now in Michigan. So [the primary]'s results will tamp down the call for a new candidate at least for a week,\" Ayres says. Ayres points out that there hasn't been any momentum in this Republican race. Candidates win one round and then go on to lose the next. Plus, the delegate process has turned the GOP primary into a longer-than-expected campaign. Managing Stereotypes In six days, there will be another set of contests when 10 states vote on Super Tuesday. Ohio is the biggest prize and the biggest test for Romney. It's a must-win battleground for the fall, filled with the kind of white working-class voters Romney has had trouble with. To connect with those voters, Rogers says, Romney needs to solve a problem he created for himself with awkward comments about his wealth. \"Every candidate develops a negative stereotype, and almost always that negative stereotype is managed, not solved,\" Rogers says. \"He's not going to solve his aloofness and some of the vocabulary and quips he has that suggest he is a wealthy man. \"He's just got to watch it, or he proves the stereotype that he is a wealthy, aloof, disconnected soul.\" Romney has admitted he has made mistakes \u2014 such as when he said his wife has a couple of Cadillacs, or when he was asked Sunday at the Daytona speedway whether he follows NASCAR. \"Not as closely as some of the most ardent fans,\" he responded, \"but I have some great friends that are NASCAR team owners.\" The problem isn't that Romney is rich \u2014 so were Franklin D. Roosevelt, John F. Kennedy and the Bushes \u2014 but it's not good to sound out of touch. Santorum's Slip As for Santorum, he needed a win in Michigan as much as Romney needed to avoid a loss. According to Ayres, Santorum has also exposed his own vulnerabilities. \"Rick Santorum came close in Michigan, to his great credit, but he came out of the contest diminished as a national candidate,\" he says. \"He started off running against sex and ended up running against college. Those are not the moves of a world-class politician. So he should be an easier contestant for Romney to beat after Michigan than before.\" Santorum seems to understand this. On Tuesday night, just days after calling the president a snob for suggesting all young people go to college, he praised his 93-year-old mother for her advanced degrees and for working outside the home. \"She's someone who ... did get a college education ... in the 1930s, and was a nurse, and got a graduate degree even as a nurse, and worked full-time,\" Santorum said. The Race Continues Santorum and Romney will probably get 15 delegates each because Michigan awards its delegates proportionally instead of winner take all. There are a lot more proportional primaries coming up, says Republican demographer John B. Morgan, because the Republican National Committee created new rules. The committee thought a longer process, similar to what the Democrats had in 2008, would be a good thing. \"They are getting what they designed: They are getting a process that is going to go on through March,\" he says. However, most Republicans now believe there probably won't be a contested convention \u2014 the scenario where no one gets the necessary 1,144 delegates. Morgan says the contest will continue regardless because Santorum, Newt Gingrich and Ron Paul still have opportunities later in March to gain more delegates. Meanwhile, the grinding Republican primary is delaying the day when the nominee can turn his full attention to President Obama and the fall campaign.",

Mitt Romney made what his campaign billed as a big economic speech Friday at Ford Field, home of the NFL's Detroit Lions which can hold 65,000 people. Photos of Romney's crowd of 1,200 members of the Detroit Economic Club seated at the 30 yard line against a backdrop of all those empty seats didn't necessarily present the kind of image a presidential campaign normally strives for just days before an important primary, in this case Michigan's. Romney's campaign said the club changed the event from the originally scheduled hotel venue when it became clear that strong ticket sales required a larger room. In any event, in terms of the substance of the speech, as NPR correspondent Ari Shapiro reported on All Things Considered Friday, Romney didn't offer much that was new. He essentially reprised key points of his economic proposals. ARI: He went through his plans to shrink government and lower taxes. He wants to reduce everyone's rates. He says he'll pay for the tax cuts by eliminating unspecified deductions. ROMNEY: \"These changes I will not allow to raise the deficit. Stronger economic growth, spending cuts and broadening the base will offset the reductions.\" ARI: For the most part these are ideas Romney has talked about before. There were a few new proposals \u2014 for example, raising the Medicare elligibility age by a month each year, then locking it in to increase with life expectancy. The audience generally responded with polite applause. Some in the audience questioned a staple of Romney's speeches, his union bashing, especially in Michigan of all places. ROMNEY: In my view, the industry got in trouble because the UAW asked for too much, management gave too much, and the government CAFE standards hurt domestic automakers... As we look forward, the UAW must not imperil the future of the industry. The Detroit News' Marisa Schultz quoted a Republican who attended the speech who had doubts about Romney's anti-union message. Nick Singelis of Flint said he's not sure who he'll choose Tuesday. He's a Republican but he can't understand why Romney continues to attack unions in Michigan \u2014 and again in Detroit. \"Taking pot shots at the union doesn't serve either candidate well,\" said Singelis of Shiners International. Again on Friday in Ford Field, he called Romney's jab at the UAW \u2014 \"a huge communication error.\" Tom Walsh, a business columnist for the Detroit Free Press, sounded a similar note: Even if Romney is partially right about the past \u2014 heck, even UAW President Bob King concedes his union made mistakes \u2014 why go out of your way to alienate a big voting bloc just to score a point or two with the presumably anti-union crowd that votes in GOP primaries? Doesn't Romney recall that one of the great political feats of former President Ronald Reagan was that the conservative Reagan won lots of blue-collar votes in Michigan? Schultz of the Detroit News reported that there were those in the audience who liked the blame Romney heaped on unions, so his message clearly had some appeal. Still, with a race in which the most recent polls suggest that Romney is in a statistical dead heat with Rick Santorum, Romney could lose more than he gains if his anti-union comments lead enough blue-collar workers with Republican leanings to vote for his rival Santorum who has been making direct appeals to working-class Midwesterners.",

            "article_content": "In Michigan, jobs and the economy lead every stump speech given by the candidates vying to win next Tuesday's Republican presidential primary. But reporter Quinn Klinefelter of WDET found that social issues are gaining traction among the rank-and-file GOP voters. The latest polling shows that the Republican presidential contest in Michigan is tightening dramatically. Mitt Romney has cut deeply into the substantial lead Rick Santorum held earlier this month, Klinefelter noted in a report on Morning Edition. The results come as Romney and his superPAC, Restore Our Future, are flooding the airwaves with new advertising in Michigan that paints Santorum as a big-spending Washington insider. Romney's campaign is outspending Santorum by a roughly three-to-one margin, Klinefelter reports. Romney won in Michigan in 2008, when the state's primary voters viewed him as more conservative than front-runner John McCain. But this time around, Klinefelter notes, Romney must convince the rank-and-file he is just as conservative as Santorum. Santorum's social agenda is resonating with people in Michigan like student Chris Sauders, who Klinefelter met near a gas station in working-class Roseville. \"He seems more family values and I think we've kind of lost that. Everything is just so money detailed and oriented. I believe family should come first,\" Sauders says. He wasn't swayed by Romney's status as a native son of Michigan. \"Although Michigan's economy still hinges on the auto industry, recent surveys find only about a third of likely Republican voters care that both Romney and Santorum opposed federal bailouts for the industry,\" Klinefelter reports. Retiree Marty Beary tells Klinefelter that she simply wants to throw all the rascals out in the country and in this heavily-unionized state and start anew. \"We need a change. I don't think that Obama's any good and I don't think that Mick [sic] Romney is any good. It's about time the people in Michigan \u2014 I don't care if they are union people \u2014 it's about time that they woke up and started voting Republican,\" Beary says. Another voter, Jeff Lawson, who runs the small Triangle Printing company, says he trusts Romney's business acumen to deliver change. \"Well less taxes would help me. More businesses around here would certainly help a lot that haven't been driven out of business over the last couple years. My customer base is about half of what it was three-four years ago. And of all those customers, they order about half of what they used to order,\" Lawson says. About ten miles away, in the affluent Detroit suburb of Grosse Pointe, laid-off schoolteacher John Bonar is waiting tables. He tells Klinefelter that economic concerns aren't what make him lean towards Santorum \u2014 it's the kind of values he wants to see in the White House. \"Reason being I believe he's more in line with my value system and he's definitely, I believe, has a better record for pro-life. You know Mitt's kind of flip-flopped on that issue,\" Bonar says.",

            "article_content": "Polling reveals the  Republican presidential contest in Michigan is tightening  dramatically. One of the keys to success in next Tuesday's primary is appealing to blue-collar Republican voters.  RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: And leading up to that election, we're hearing lots of speeches by the presidential candidates highlighting jobs and the economy. That's especially true for the Republican hopefuls campaigning now in Michigan. Social issues do still count with some, as WDET's Quinn Klinefelter found when he talked to voters outside Detroit. QUINN KLINEFELTER, BYLINE: Polling reveals the Republican presidential contest in Michigan is tightening dramatically. Mitt Romney has cut deeply into the substantial lead Rick Santorum held earlier this month. (SOUNDBITE OF CAR STARTING) KLINEFELTER: But Santorum's social agenda is resonating with people in Michigan like student Chris Sauders, standing near a gas station in working-class Roseville. CHRIS SAUDERS: He seems more family values and I think we've kind of lost that. Everything is just so money detailed and oriented. I believe family should come first. KLINEFELTER: Romney's from Michigan. Does it matter that he's a native son? SAUDERS: Not to me, it doesn't. I really want someone who's going to do what's best for the country as a whole, not where they're from. KLINEFELTER: Michigan's economy still hinges on the auto industry. But recent surveys find only about a third of likely Republican voters care that both Romney and Santorum opposed federal bailouts for the industry. Sliding into a nearby pickup truck, Brian Hallema says the economy should be issue number one for any candidate in both Michigan and the nation.    Hallema says he's not sure which GOP presidential contender he'll support.    But he builds signs for a living, and he says the economic signs in the state have not been good for far too long. BRIAN HALLEMA: It seems like a lot of people that are working are still poor. You know, something needs to done with that. I don't know what to do about that. I'm overdrafting my account just to get gas to get to and from work. KLINEFELTER: Retiree Marty Beary says she simply wants to throw all the rascals out in the country and in this heavily unionized state and start anew. MARTY BEARY: We need a change. I don't think that Obama's any good and I don't think that Mitt Romney is any good. It's about time the people in Michigan - I don't care if they are union people - it's about time they woke up and started voting Republican. KLINEFELTER: Down the road, where Jeff Lawson runs the small Triangle printing company, numerous stores remain vacant. Lawson says he wants a change too and trusts Romney's business acumen to deliver it. Others, he says, are too focused on social conservatism, but he likes Romney's economic plan. JEFF LAWSON: Well, less taxes would help me. More businesses around here would certainly help a lot that have been driven out of business over the last couple of years. My customer base is about half of what it was three or four years ago. And of all those customers, they order about half of what they used to order. KLINEFELTER: About 10 miles away, customers order food at the City Kitchen in the affluent Detroit suburb of Gross Pointe. Laid-off schoolteacher John Bonar is waiting tables, but he says it isn't economic concerns that make him lean toward Santorum; it's the kind of values he wants to see in the White House. JOHN BONAR: Reason being, I believe he's more in line with my value system and he definitely, I believe, has a better record for pro-life. You know, Mitt's kind of flip-flopped on that issue. KLINEFELTER: Still, polls this week show Romney drawing nearly even with Santorum. The results come as Romney and his superPAC, Restore Our Future, are flooding the airwaves with new advertising in Michigan, painting Santorum as a big-spending Washington insider. But Romney's campaign is outspending Santorum by a roughly three-to-one margin. It's a testament to the stakes involved in Michigan, where Romney won in 2008. This time he must convince the rank and file he not only has a strong economic plan but is just as conservative as Santorum. For NPR News, I'm Quinn Klinefelter in Detroit.

            "article_content": "Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Rhode Island Democrat, introduced legislation this week that would effectively raise taxes for most who earn more than $1 million annually.\n                \n                    \n                    Pete Marovich/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption At last week's State of the Union address, the secretary of billionaire investor Warren Buffett was seated prominently with first lady Michelle Obama. President Obama invited Debbie Bosanek to a seat in the spotlight to underscore a complaint her boss has widely made: that she pays a much higher tax rate than the 17 percent Buffett himself pays. Speaking to a joint session of Congress, Obama proposed what he called the \"Buffett Rule\": Anyone making more than $1 million a year should pay no less than 30 percent in taxes. \"You can call this class warfare all you want. But asking a billionaire to pay at least as much as his secretary in taxes? Most Americans would call that common sense,\" Obama said. Sen. Mike Johanns, R-Neb., said Obama was simply trying to score political points in an election year. \"When he picks out one item \u2014 rich vs. poor \u2014 that's class warfare,\" said Johanns. \"And I know he says, 'Well, you can call it what you want.' But the truth of the matter, he knows what he's doing.\" New Legislation This week, Obama's Buffett Rule took the form of a bill introduced on the Senate floor. \"I rise today to introduce legislation that would address some loopholes in the tax codes, which provide for super high-income Americans ways to pay lower tax rates than are paid by regular, hard-working, middle-class families,\" said Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I. The bill is aimed at the wealthiest of all taxpayers \u2014 the highest-earning one-tenth of 1 percent of Americans. It would affect  roughly 100,000 taxpayers nationwide who \u2014 like Berkshire Hathaway CEO Buffett, and GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney \u2014 earn more than $1 million a year, but pay less than 30 percent in taxes. In 1985, then-New Jersey Gov. Thomas Kean and President Ronald Reagan hold an oversized income tax form in Bloomfield, N.J. Reagan was pushing changes to the tax code that were later enacted.\n                \n                    \n                    AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption In 1985, then-New Jersey Gov. Thomas Kean and President Ronald Reagan hold an oversized income tax form in Bloomfield, N.J. Reagan was pushing changes to the tax code that were later enacted. \"To call our tax system fair, I believe the highest-income Americans should pay a higher rate, not a lower one, than middle-income taxpayers,\" said Whitehouse. Tax rates for all Americans are in fact lower than they were 30 years ago. But tax expert Roberton Williams of the Urban Institute says rates have fallen the farthest for the top-income earners. \"Our top tax rate now is just 35 percent,\" said Williams. \"Twelve years ago, it was 39.6 percent. If you go back into the 1960s, it was 70 percent. In the 1950s, it was 90 percent. ...We have a much lower tax rate now than we had before. Raising the tax rate on high-income people would not be out of line historically.\" Debating What's A Fair Share Tax cuts for income and for capital gains and dividends were pushed through Congress by President George W. Bush. Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a top economic adviser to Bush who now runs the American Action Forum, a GOP think tank, insisted the wealthy are paying their fair share. \"They are paying for national defense, infrastructure, basic research, education. And when you have a small group providing all of the government to the rest of America, it strikes me as exceedingly weird to say, 'Pony up,' \" Holtz-Eakin said. \"They've already paid for the whole thing. Why are we asking for more?\" In fact, in 2009, the top 1 percent of tax filers paid about 37 percent of all federal income taxes. Despite GOP opposition, Whitehouse thinks he may pick up more support in the Senate. He points out that the Bush tax cuts are set to expire at the end of this year. \"So, if the Republicans want to avoid [an expiration of the Bush tax cuts], then they're going to have to agree to some things that they may not otherwise like,\" said Whitehouse. But Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., has doubts about getting the Buffett Rule bill through Congress, noting that Senate Republicans closed ranks late last year to block a relatively small tax hike on millionaires. \"We can't even get them to allow us to raise the rate 3 percent on folks on their second million dollars of income. The Republicans are unwilling to even consider that. So I think the voters are going to have to weigh in here,\" said McCaskill. Voters will have a clear chance to do so, nine months from now.",

            "article_content": "All the Republican presidential candidates are campaigning in South Carolina Thursday because the primary is on Saturday. Many voters have still not made up their minds which candidate to vote for.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Yeah, Perry is still speaking but of course he is speaking of his campaign in the past tense, saying I ran for president because I love America. Now, he drops out at a fluid time in South Carolina. There is a poll out this morning that shows Mitt Romney with just a two point lead over Newt Gingrich, 31-29. Now, if you look a little more closely at that same survey, you see that the people who are leaning one way or the other give Romney a bit more of an edge. But it's still relatively close, and some undetermined number of Perry supporters \u2013 a few percentage points \u2013 are now deciding which way they want to go. The high stakes may explain why Newt Gingrich predicted the Romney campaign would be, quote, \"dirty and dishonest\" at the end. Romney's campaign put out a press release yesterday headlined: Newt Gingrich, leadership by chaos. Voters are struggling to make a choice, as NPR's Mara Liasson reports from South Carolina. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Every bit of available ad time on South Carolina television has been purchased, and when you turn on your set, there seems to be nothing on but this... (SOUNDBITE OF TV ADS) UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: Obama supported the Wall Street bailouts. So did Romney. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: Newt attacks because he has more baggage than the airlines. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: Don't be fooled. Rick Santorum, a record of betrayal. Another... LIASSON: In Mount Pleasant, just outside of Charleston, at Page's Okra Grill, voters like Julie Dunn are just disgusted with the record number of negative ads. JULIE DUNN: I'm really upset with all of them, that they're being so ugly to each other. LIASSON: Dunn is a paralegal and she's undecided. She's thinking about voting for Romney, but she's not sure. DUNN: Well, I don't know. You know, you think well, maybe Romney's got a handle on capitalism and how to make things grow. But then, you know, am I voting for him just because he's the frontrunner? That's kind of where I am. LIASSON: Her friend Nelson Little doesn't share her ambivalence. Little is strong for Romney. NELSON LITTLE: I think he can help America get back to the capitalist values that we've had in the past. LIASSON: You know, he just came out and said that he pays 15 percent tax rate. I don't know if you pay 15 percent tax rate... LITTLE: Actually, I do, but I don't have the kind of money he has, or the tax shelters. But that's fine. LIASSON: But Romney hasn't won everyone here. Over at the community table, Bill Bailey is having breakfast with a group of old friends - all working-class conservative Republicans. BILL BAILEY: I've made up my mind, I think. I'm going with Newt. I'll be honest with you. I don't trust Romney. I'm just having a bad feeling about him. LIASSON: Bailey has a problem with Romney's background. BAILEY: We need someone to look out for the small people. LIASSON: Why don't you think Romney would look out for the small people? BAILEY: I just don't. AL MOESSNER: He's not one of them. BAILEY: He is not one of the small people. LIASSON: When you heard that he only pays 15 percent on his taxes, what did you think of that? BAILEY: I didn't like it. (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER) LIASSON: Why? BAILEY: Because I have to pay - what little bit I make - I have to pay probably up to 28 to 30 percent. MOESSNER: He's had 15 debates to convince me he's going to take care of me, and he hasn't done it yet. BAILEY: Yeah. LIASSON: That's Al Moessner. He doesn't like what he's heard about Romney's wealth, business practices and tax rate either. But because none of the remaining conservative candidates was able to consolidate the anti-Romney vote, the dynamic of the race never changed. Romney's still the frontrunner here. Polls show Gingrich in second place, Rick Santorum stuck in third. Santorum recently got a boost when a group of evangelical leaders endorsed him. But although there is a large pool of born again Christian voters here, there seems to be a cultural barrier for Santorum. Here's how Richard Kirkland answered when I asked, what about Santorum? RICHARD KIRKLAND: I'm still in the South. That ought to answer that. He can handle the Northern states. I don't think he knows how to mess with the Southern states. We are a different world down here. LIASSON: And in the different world of South Carolina Republican politics, winning appears to be trumping everything else this year. South Carolina Senator Jim DeMint says Republican voters in South Carolina are not looking for a perfect fit. SENATOR JIM DEMINT: I think the Republican who's going to win this year is the one who I think looks the most electable in the general election, one who can deal most effectively with the economy, and convinces people that they are satisfactory in the social conservative area. LIASSON: Sounds like he's describing Mitt Romney. DeMint is a potential kingmaker in South Carolina, but he doesn't plan to endorse before the primary. He did endorse Romney in 2008, and many of his supporters and donors are backing Romney this year. Like other conservatives, they think Romney is the likely nominee and their best chance to beat President Obama. INSKEEP: That's NPR's Mara Liasson in South Carolina, where Rick Perry has now formerly said he is dropping out of the presidential race and endorsement Newt Gingrich, as the other candidates prepare for a debate tonight.

Reporter Jodi Kantor details how they figured out how to maintain their friendships and family life after moving into the White House. In late 2006, Barack Obama held a meeting with his wife, Michelle, and his advisers to weigh whether he should run for president. \"And Michelle Obama, in front of everybody, asks her husband a very dramatic question,\" says New York Times Washington correspondent Jodi Kantor. \"She says, 'What do you think you can bring to this that the other candidates can't?' \" Her husband paused for a second, and then responded, \"I really think if I became president, it would inspire people all over the world to think of new possibilities.\" \"What he was talking about, of course, was the fall of a racial barrier,\" Kantor says. \"Being role models is essential to why the Obamas first decided to do this. And yet, when you're a role model, you open yourself up so entirely. You are putting yourself on the line so completely, and everything you do is open to criticism.\" by Jodi Kantor Paperback, 365 pages | Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How? Kantor traces how the Obamas have dealt with that criticism \u2014 and tried to maintain their marriage and family life in the midst of a very public spotlight \u2014  in her new book, The Obamas. \"My goal was to write a book about the presidency that treated the president and the first lady as partners, which is what I truly think they are,\" she tells Fresh Air's Dave Davies. Initial Reservations According to Kantor, the first lady initially had serious reservations about her husband's ambitions for the White House. \"She was worried, in part, about the impact on her family. But she also had concerns that it may not be the right time,\" Kantor says. \"Her chief of staff told me that during that time, the decision just weighed on Michelle Obama \u2014 because she really believed that her husband could accomplish great things as president, but she wasn't sure if it was the best thing for their family. And how do you make that choice between what is best for you personally versus the contribution you think you can make to the country?\" During the campaign in 2008, Michelle Obama continued to have a rough time. \"She was up against Bill Clinton, because that was Hillary Clinton's spouse,\" Kantor says. \"In early events, she charmed lots of people ... But she also had problems. In the spring of 2008, she was accused of being 'an angry black woman.' Fox News called her a 'baby-mama.' There were a lot of ugly things said about her.\" Friends and aides told Kantor that Michelle Obama was extremely hurt by the accusations. \"She thought of herself as one type of person, and to see that image so widely distorted \u2014 and it can happen so fast \u2014 it can be really disorienting for anyone,\" Kantor says. Jodi Kantor spoke to more than 200 sources, including White House aides and close friends of the president, while researching her new biography on the Obamas. Kantor is a Washington correspondent for The New York Times. \n                \n                    \n                    Juliana Sohn/Courtesy of the author\n                    \n                \nhide caption Jodi Kantor spoke to more than 200 sources, including White House aides and close friends of the president, while researching her new biography on the Obamas. Kantor is a Washington correspondent for The New York Times. So when the Obamas got to the White House, they made a conscientious effort to clamp down and surround themselves with people they already knew from Chicago \u2014 to keep some sense of normalcy. \"A lot of their instincts become very self-protected,\" Kantor says. \"Again and again, in my reporting, I found the motif of them drawing up the gangplanks.\" But recently, Michelle Obama has seemed much more comfortable with her role. \"She's really popular. She's much more popular than her husband, and that has really given her so much internal leverage because they need her so badly for 2012,\" she says. \"She's totally key to their strategy, and if you look at her in the last couple of months, she's gone from appearing not too frequently to being almost ubiquitous. And she's become much more comfortable in public life, and much more comfortable politically. For 2012 ... she says she's all-in this time.\" On Barack Obama's schedule  \"His day is scheduled by 33 people. Imagine being the first lady and worrying about his sleep or if his kids have an event at school. Who does she talk to to interface with his schedule? What is the right procedure? And this is a first lady who is very aware of not being seen as a meddling spouse.\" On politics \"Barack Obama has always been a real optimist about what can be accomplished. He believes that government can be used to create systemic, long-term, real change. And the first lady is more of a skeptic in the relationship, but she's also the idealist ... She said again and again [after watching her husband in the Illinois Legislature] that she didn't come to the process with a lot of faith that politics could really improve people's lives for the better.\" On moving into the White House in 2008 \"They discover that the place is nothing like a normal American family home. There's no private entrance or exit where they can go undetected. There isn't what we think of as a contemporary American kitchen, where the family can sit around at bar stools and make coffee in the morning. There's no way for Michelle Obama to spontaneously walk Bo, the new dog, just wearing sweats and a T-shirt without the possibility of being caught by photographers.\" On the White House staff \"Many of the residential staff are older African-Americans, and they were so excited  when the Obamas got there. A White House aide told me that on the night of Inauguration, the White House staff just couldn't contain themselves,\" she says. \"So then the Obamas move into this very unusual house, they're the rare first couple not to have lived in some executive mansion beforehand  ... and one of the president's best friends said to me, 'We feel so connected to this staff because they're working-class African-Americans, and that's our background too. It's strange for us initially to be waited on by these people because we feel like we know them.'\" On Sen. Daschle pressing President Obama to hold more parties  \"Sen. Daschle really, really urged it, and I think it's been really hard for the president to do for a couple of reasons. One is [his] family time, which is extremely important to him. And the other is the Republican strategy really has been one of total opposition. So what a lot of people in the White House said to me was, 'Look, this is their strategy. It's total opposition. A little canape and cocktail frank is not necessarily going to break down the wall of mistrust we have with Republicans.' That said, Sen. Daschle's point was that you just have to keep trying. You just have to keep hammering away. Interestingly, that's not at all what the president is doing now. If you look at his strategy for 2012, he's basically been really honest about the fact that he's going to be attacking the Republican Congress right and left. This era of Barack Obama trying to be this bipartisan uniter seems to be over, at least for now.\" The \"No New Friends\" rule in 2004  \"They established a 'no-new friends' rule. [The first lady's brother told me], 'Look, we don't know what other people's agendas are. We're essentially freezing our friendships where we are now.' [The first family] basically decided, 'We're not here in Washington to make new friends.' They wanted to spend their time with the same group of people.'\" On the president's close friendships with Eric Whitaker and Marty Nesbitt \"They both said to me that they make the point of almost never challenging the president on anything, and in fact, don't talk about work with him \u2014 they wait for him to bring it up. So, on the one hand, they're certainly doing the job of keeping things normal by playing pool or basketball with him. But on the other hand, if there are things that your friends are not willing to raise with you, is that total normality either? The whole question of what is or isn't normal in the White House is just something that keeps coming up again and again.\"",

News and WMUR Republican Presidential Debate at Saint Anselm College on Saturday in Manchester, N.H. Once more, the great media consensus was confounded. Saturday night's debate at St. Anselm's College in Manchester, N.H., produced another battle among half a dozen presidential contenders, much like a dozen before it. Front-runner Mitt Romney was neither knocked out nor even knocked down. He was scarcely even knocked around. Once again, the evening ended with the bruises pretty equally distributed among the contestants. And with the New Hampshire primary bearing down on Tuesday, virtually no time remains for Romney's rivals to bring him down. It was not supposed to be like this. Not this time. Since the Iowa caucuses earlier in the week, every reporter, commentator and kibitzer paying attention to the Republican presidential decathlon predicted Romney's five remaining rivals would gang tackle him at St. Anselm's. Myself included. But it didn't happen. The debate was over before any of Romney's rivals had landed the big haymaker. Far from catching him in a crossfire, they took just as many shots at each other. So what was it that stayed the hands of these supposed co-conspirators? Was it the format? Or were the moderators too intent on distributing the confrontations among various pairings? Within the first half hour, the liveliest interchange was between Rick Santorum, the former senator, and Ron Paul, the current congressman. They feuded over federal spending and size of government and true conservatism. Later they went at it again over who was more truthful about the other. When given a chance to repeat his own denigration of Romney as a manager rather than a leader, Santorum hemmed and hawed. The biggest disappointment for those expecting Romney to be roughed up was the performance of Newt Gingrich. The former speaker has been fuming for weeks about the way Romney's independent allies knee-capped him with TV attack ads in Iowa. He has spoken of Romney himself as a liar. But at St. Anselm's, the meanest Gingrich got was a reference to a New York Times story questioning Romney's claims of job creation in his days at Bain Capital. Romney had his ready answer prepared and unloaded it in rapid-fire fashion. It might not have been charming, but it seemed to work. Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who nearly quit the race earlier in the week, roared back with several strong assertions designed to return attention to him. One was a promise to send U.S. troops back into Iraq if he's elected. Perry said it was a huge mistake to leave that country now. Inevitably, this reminds voters of another Texas governor, who recently served as president (and invaded Iraq in the first place). It is also a position at odds with more than two-thirds of American voters' views. In fact, it is hard to think of any policy decision President Obama has made that has been more popular (except perhaps the decision to go after Osama bin Laden and kill him). So Perry was clearly prepared to roll the dice. But he wasn't rolling them on any attacks on Romney. In one of the sharper moments of the evening, Romney turned on Jon Huntsman, calling him out for carrying Obama's water in China \u2014 failing to stop Chinese mischief. Huntsman may not have helped himself much by responding in Mandarin about starting a trade war. Romney won the exchange in the hall and probably among likely Republican primary voters too. For his part, Paul was more intent on backing up his attacks on the conservatism of Santorum and Gingrich. His best moment came when Gingrich unspooled a lengthy apologia for his own lack of military service. Said Paul in terse rebuttal: \"When I was drafted, I had a wife and two kids, and I went.\" But in a sense, the man most on the hot seat Saturday night was not Romney but Santorum, the surprise co-winner in Iowa. Santorum has had the last of all the surges among the anti-Mitt contestants. And he has been campaigning the hardest the past few days to raise his third-place numbers in New Hampshire. Santorum says we shouldn't talk about \"middle class\" because we don't have classes in America. It was a remarkable statement, and one that speaks to Santorum's potential as a different kind of Republican. He is not anti-union and he is not opposed to a governmental role in supporting manufacturers and U.S. jobs. He talks about his immigrant, blue collar, Catholic roots. He is trying to redefine the party to acknowledge its new base among white, working-class males who are religious and social traditionalists. In so doing, the former senator makes his campaign meaningful in historic terms. But he is way too late to win the nomination with this thrust in this cycle unless he first finds a way to make Romney less inevitable. Just talking about Santorum is not enough. The same is true now for all the would-be alternatives to Romney. Time is running out.",

            "article_content": "The Iowa caucuses \u2014 the first contest of the 2012 presidential nominating  season \u2014 were held Tuesday night. President Obama was unopposed, but Democrats met  in caucuses across the state for what was essentially a pep rally.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Democrats have been trying to generate some enthusiasm. And last night in Iowa, Democrats also turned out, though Barack Obama faced no opposition. Here's Iowa Public Radio's Sarah McCammon. SARAH MCCAMMON, BYLINE: With all the attention focused on the twists and turns in the GOP race, you could almost forget that Democrats were holding caucuses, too. (SOUNDBITE OF A CROWD) MCCAMMON: Lincoln High School, in a working-class neighborhood near downtown Des Moines, was just one of many sites across the state where Democrats gathered last night. President Obama, appearing by teleconference remote from Washington, told these early supporters he hasn't forgotten them. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: I want you to know that because of you - because of all the memories I have of being in, you know, your living rooms, or meeting you in a diner, or seeing you over at a campaign office - I have never lost that same source of inspiration that drove me to embark on this journey in the first place. You guys inspire me every single day. MCCAMMON: The president urged supporters to maintain the same energy and optimism he witnessed in the state four years ago, when the state raised him from underdog to eventual nominee in the January caucuses and gave him an eight-point win in November. Megan Jacobs of the Iowa Democratic Party says even without a fight for the nomination, organizing now is important for the president's success in fall. And it all begins with the caucuses. MEGAN JACOBS: That's huge, I mean that's how President Obama got his start last time around here in Iowa, with grassroots support, and that's how he's going to do it this time around. MCCAMMON: But this time around, even the president and his backers acknowledge the state will be tough. In his message last night, Mr. Obama said it will be a big battle, but added that he's excited. During a brief question and answer session plagued by several technical problems, Carol White spoke from a caucus site in Cedar Rapids. She praised the president for pushing through healthcare reform. CAROL WHITE: I am a breast cancer survivor and was a social worker for 33 years before retiring and know firsthand what a great accomplishment the Affordable Care Act is, among your other achievements. How do you respond to people who say you have not done enough? OBAMA: You know, I think the main message that we're going to have in 2012 is that we've done a lot, but we've got a lot more to do. And that's why we need another four years to get it all done. MCCAMMON: Heath care remains an important issue for 38-year-old Des Moines resident William Sheets, who came to the caucus with his elderly mother, whom he cares for full-time. WILLIAM SHEETS: I'm a big supporter of the health care, and - because my daughters are in the health care system and they need some help in there - and we don't make that much money. And I'm here to show my support for the president. Even though I didn't support him the first time around, I wanted to show that this time around that I'm liking all the things he did and I'm here to support him. MCCAMMON: Democratic leaders hope to engage voters like Sheets - persuading them to be with the president not only on caucus night and Election Day, but in the months in between - as volunteer campaign workers. Betty Brim-Hunter is an official with the party's local county organization, as well as a state union leader. Speaking before the crowd of about 250, she asked supporters to sign up to knock on doors and make phone calls. BETTY BRIM-HUNTER: Polk County Democrats will be calling you, the Obama campaign will be calling. You know, if we'd all just do a little bit, we can get it taken care of. So, thank you so much and let's go caucus. MCCAMMON: The supporters got a good start last night, if numbers released by the Iowa Democratic Party are any indication. Officials say more than 25,000 Iowans attended Democratic caucuses, and more than 7500 promised to volunteer. For NPR News, I'm Sarah McCammon in Des Moines.

How to convince voters that while the economy isn't roaring, the situation is still improving? That's President Obama's challenge, made more difficult with every passing month where the jobs report disappoints, as on Friday. The latest Labor Department report informed us that only 69,000 jobs were created in May, less than half what analysts had forecast. Meanwhile, the jobless rate ticked up a tenth of a percentage point to 8.2 percent. Fortunately (or unfortunately, to put it more accurately) for the president, he and other White House officials have gotten plenty of practice in trying to put the best face on dissatisfying economic numbers while trying to stay on the offensive. Obama, for instance, had a visit to a Honeywell plant in Minnesota on his Friday schedule so he could talk up his initiative to encourage employers to hire military veterans. It was part of a strategy to show that he has ideas for improving the nation's job picture. Obama, of course, couldn't help but acknowledge to the audience at the plant the good news, bad news nature of the current economic story: \"And today, we're still fighting our way back from the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. The economy is growing again but it's not growing as fast as we want it to grow. Our businesses have created almost 4.3 million new jobs over the last 27 months, but as we learned in today's job report, we are still not creating them as fast as we want. \"And just like this time last year, our economy is still facing some serious headwinds. We had high gas prices a month, two months ago, and they're starting to come down, and they were spiking, but they're still hitting people's wallets pretty hard. That has an impact. And then, most prominently, most recently, we've had a crisis in Europe's economy that is having an impact worldwide, and it's starting to cast a shadow on our own as well. So we've got a lot of work to do before we get to where we need to be. And all these factors have made it even more challenging to not just fully recover, but also lay the foundation for an economy that's built to last over the long term\" Keeping with the theme of trying to take the offensive, it was also a chance for the president to once again publicly prod the Republican-led House to pass his economic \"to-do\" list that, he says, would improve job growth. That was also an opportunity, which the president tries to take advantage of any chance he gets, to remind voters that much of his economic agenda has been blocked by that very same House since Republicans took control in January 2011. Meanwhile, the White House's chief economist, Alan Krueger, who heads the Council of Economic Advisers, did his part to try and drive home the message that the economic situation the president inherited was dire, that real progress has been made and to urge patience. In a blog post on the White House website he wrote: \"Problems in the job market were long in the making and will not be solved overnight. The economy lost jobs for 25 straight months beginning in February 2008, and over 8 million jobs were lost as a result of the Great Recession. We are still fighting back from the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. \"Today we learned that the economy has added private sector jobs for 27 straight months, for a total of 4.3 million payroll jobs over that period. The economy is growing but it is not growing fast enough... Obama's problem, however, was that as much as he wants to be on offense, the weak economic recovery continues to force him on the defensive, as it does with all presidents who find themselves running for re-election against a backdrop of a ho-hum recovery. Such recoveries always make it easier for the challenger, in this case Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, to create an argument to which many voters prove willing to listen for why the incumbent in the White House needs to go. That was true for then Gov. Ronald Reagan in his 1980 challenge to President Jimmy Carter and then Gov. Bill Clinton in his 1992 contest against President George H.W. Bush. Both Carter and Bush ran for re-election after economic recoveries had already begun to lift the nation out of the preceding recessions. But voters didn't buy those incumbents arguments about real improvements in the economy and voted them out. With a message that could have easily been delivered by Reagan or Clinton, Mitt Romney said in a statement Friday: \"Today's weak jobs report is devastating news for American workers and American families. This week has seen a cascade of one bad piece of economic news after another. Slowing GDP growth, plunging consumer confidence, an increase in unemployment claims, and now another dismal jobs report all stand as a harsh indictment of the President's handling of the economy. It is now clear to everyone that President Obama's policies have failed to achieve their goals and that the Obama economy is crushing America's middle class. The President's re-election slogan may be 'forward,' but it seems like we've been moving backward. We can do so much better in America. That's why I'm running for president.\" And as Romney pointed the finger of blame at Obama, congressional Republicans pointed their at both Obama and the Democrats who control the Senate, accusing them of simultaneously doing the wrong thing and doing nothing. In a statement, Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) said: \"And it's clear that the policies that we've seen are not working. And I would just hope that the president and my colleagues in the Senate would look at our plan to create American jobs. Passed over 30 bills that are sitting in the United States Senate. We can help the American people at a time of this great need if the Senate would just look at the bills that are before us.\" With five months left between now and Election Day, it's still obviously too early to predict the outcome of the November election based on Friday's employment report. Some things can safely be predicted, however. If the economy continues May's unsteady progress, Obama and other administration officials will keep pointing out rays of economic hope and reminding voters of how bad situation was when they took office. Meanwhile, Romney, aided by congressional Republicans, will continue to paint the president and his economic policies as a failure.",

Those are just three of the words economists are using to describe the news that just 69,000 net jobs were added to public and private payrolls last month \u2014 and that the nation's jobless rate edged up to 8.2 percent from April's 8.1 percent. The news has raised fears that the hoped-for strengthening of the economy may not materialize. We posted on the news and followed with details from the report and reaction to it. It's now 11:22 am. ET, here's our original post and earlier updates: The nation's unemployment rate rose to 8.2 percent in May from 8.1 percent in April as just 69,000 jobs were added to public and private payrolls, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said this morning. Both numbers are disappointments. Economists had expected BLS would say the jobless rate had stayed at 8.1 percent and that payrolls expanded by at least 150,000 jobs.

Income, Consumer Spending Figures Also Weak: Meanwhile, the Bureau of Economic Analysis says Americans' personal income rose just 0.2 percent in April from March and that consumer spending grew by a modest 0.3 percent. The income gain, the slowest in five months, raises concerns \"about the ability of Americans to keep spending in the future,\" The Associated Press writes. Update at 9:04 a.m. ET. \"Marginally Attached\" Workers Also On The Rise. Another sobering detail from the report: \"In May, 2.4 million persons were marginally attached to the labor force, up from 2.2 million a year earlier. ... These individuals were not in the labor force, wanted and were available for work, and had looked for a job sometime in the prior 12 months.

A Vicious Cycle? Economists sometimes talk about \"virtuous\" and \"vicious\" cycles. Basically, once the economy gets on a roll it can continue to expand as confidence, incomes and jobs all rise and build on each other. Conversely, when things aren't going well that can create a downward spiral. Bloomberg News writes that: \"Bigger job and wage gains are needed to jumpstart a self- sustaining increase in hiring and consumer spending that will boost the expansion. At the same time, a looming recession in the euro area and slower growth in China and Brazil may prompt American companies to reduce headcount until they see more evidence the U.S. economy isn't faltering.\" Update at 8:47 a.m. ET. A \"Sputtering\" Economy? Here's how The Associated Press sums up the news: \"The dismal jobs figures could fan fears that the economy is sputtering.\" Update at 8:46 a.m. ET. Sharp Slowing From First Quarter: According to BLS, in the first quarter the average monthly gain in payrolls was 226,000. But payrolls grew by just 77,000 in April and 69,000 in May. Update at 8:44 a.m. ET. Number Of \"Discouraged Workers\" Remains High: In another sign of the labor market's weakness, BLS says \"there were 830,000 discouraged workers in May, about the same as a year earlier.\" Update at 8:39 a.m. ET. Sharp Downward Revision Of April's Gain: BLS initially thought payrolls grew by a net 115,000 jobs in April, but now says just 77,000 positions were added that month.",

He is expected to win the March 4 presidential elections but is facing growing opposition.\n                \n                    \n                    UPI/Landov\n                    \n                \nhide caption Thousands of Russians form a 10-mile human chain around a Moscow ring road on Monday during an opposition protest against Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin. He is expected to win the March 4 presidential elections but is facing growing opposition. Cars decorated with white ribbons and carnations drove around Moscow's Garden Ring Road in a wet snow this past Sunday, honking cheerfully to the thousands of demonstrators on the sidewalk who formed a human chain around the city. Elena Korobova was a link in that chain. \"I want to get rid of Putin, because I don't like his policy, I don't like what he's doing for Russia,\" she says of Vladimir Putin, Russia's current prime minister. The 60-year-old university administrator believes elections for the parliament, or Duma, in December were rigged. Now, she is training to be a poll watcher for the presidential vote this Sunday. Vladimir  Putin, 59, served two  terms as president from 2000 to 2008.  When constitutional term limits prevented  him from running again, he changed places with his protege, Dmitry Medvedev, and  became prime minister. He is widely expected to  win. Gennady  Zyuganov, 67, head of  Russia's Communist Party, has made  three unsuccessful runs for president. His following is made up mainly of older  people nostalgic for Soviet times. Mikhail  Prokhorov, 46, is a billionaire  whose worldwide assets include the New Jersey Nets basketball team. He is  running as a pro-business independent but says he wants to form a political  party that will take its direction from the grass  roots. Vladimir  Zhirinovsky, 65, leads the  Liberal Democratic Party, a right-wing nationalist group that critics say is  neither liberal nor democratic. A perennial candidate, Zhirinovsky is noted for  his uninhibited style, once promising free vodka for everyone if he were elected  president. Putin has been Russia's most powerful leader for more than 12 years, first as president and now as prime minister. Last fall, he announced that he and the current president, Dmitry Medvedev, would switch jobs. Although Russians are expected to vote Putin back to the Kremlin, he is facing a rising wave of people power. Most Russians say they will vote but don't really like any of the five choices on the ballot. They believe Putin has manipulated the system to eliminate any real opposition. Those disenchanted voters include Olga Mosina, who is in her 30s and works with an investment company. She says she might cross off all the names, but she will go to the polls. \"I didn't vote in the Duma elections, because I thought my vote wouldn't count,\" Mosina says. \"Now I think it's important. I was at Bolotnaya and now I feel ashamed that I didn't go vote.\" Bolotnaya Square is where the first big protest took place after the apparent vote fraud in December. Mosina didn't expect so many people to join the human chain last Sunday, given the mass rallies the Kremlin has mobilized to support Putin. \"I thought the willingness of people to protest against him would be waning,\" she says. Middle-Class Discontent Russia is changing, says Boris Makarenko, director of the Center for Political Technologies in Moscow. \"By choosing such a straightforward way of returning to the Kremlin \u2014 [such] limited competition, and with [such] imperfect elections \u2014 Mr. Putin awoke the protest of middle class, [who are] crying out for dignity more than money or anything else,\" he says. That includes middle-class Russians like 47-year-old Anna Nikiforova, a newcomer to Moscow from Yakutsk, in Siberia. On Saturday, she attended a question-and-answer session with one of Putin's four challengers, Mikhail Prokhorov. Presidential candidate and Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin speaks Wednesday at a meeting with his campaign activists in Moscow. \n                \n                    \n                    Natalia Koleshikova/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Presidential candidate and Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin speaks Wednesday at a meeting with his campaign activists in Moscow. She had overcome her initial fear that the Kremlin had set Prokhorov up to run to make the ballot look competitive. The candidate wooed supporters with a pre-Lenten holiday party. Nikiforova, who works for Russia's biggest insurance company, says she is curious about Prokhorov's plans for a political party. She says she's ready to join because Prokhorov says he wants to give priority to human beings \u2014 not the state. Nikiforova's 25-year-old son, Vitaly, also likes Prokhorov. Many of his friends want to leave Russia, he says, but he wants to stay and make it better. While Prokhorov managed to pack an auditorium with a mostly young crowd at Moscow's Academy of Sciences, many of Russia's young and discontent aren't supporting anyone yet. They blame Putin for what they see as rampant corruption and the absence of rule of law. Makarenko, the political analyst, says this group is an amorphous mass. And yet, he warns, Putin is likely to face a difficult six-year term. \"He is at odds with a considerable and active part of the society, and the only recipe [for] success is to regain their trust,\" he says. And Putin won't have an easy time with people like protester Olga Mosina. \"He'll be a lame duck from Day 1,\" she says. \"I don't think he'll be in office for six years.\" The opposition is already planning more demonstrations immediately after the vote.",

For many Russians, Sagra has become a symbol of how they say the government has let them down. Russia had one of the world's most famous revolutions nearly a century ago, in 1917. Yet for centuries, the country has seemed to prefer strong leaders who promised stability rather than revolutionary change. On a trip across Russia today on the Trans-Siberian railroad, NPR's David Greene found many Russians who expressed disappointment with their current government. But most said they wanted changes to be gradual, and were not looking for a major upheaval. Second of three parts In 1941, Soviet dictator Josef Stalin carried out his plan to build a reservoir along the Volga  River. Thousands of people were ordered to move their homes or face being submerged. One of the towns that faced flooding was Mologa, where some villagers took their homes apart, log by log, piled them on rafts, and moved them to safer locations. Among the former residents of Mologa was Maria Kuvshinnikova. She was 20 in 1941 and remembers people helping each other dismantle their homes, piling belongings onto rafts, and moving to higher ground. \"When taking the houses apart, they marked each log,\" she says. \"They had everything on these rafts \u2014 utensils, domestic animals, cows.\" Kuvshinnikova is now 91 and lives in a typical Soviet-style apartment building with her daughter in the nearby town of Rybinsk. But she says she still thinks back on what a nice town Mologa had been, and all that she was forced to leave behind. \"I was sorry for Mologa \u2014 it was such a nice town with big rivers,\" she says. Then, her eyes well up. \"My mother is still in Mologa. She died in 1934. My father is here, I could go to the cemetery. But there, even if it was long ago, a mother is a mother,\" she says. Nikolai Novotelnov was also forced from his home in Mologa. When he was 16, he and his mother took apart their wooden house and moved it to Rybinsk. Now 86, Novotelnov continues to live in the same house with his wife. \"I still have memories of the churches, the tombstones,\" he says about Mologa. \"There was just a simple command: Move it all, and start living in a new place.\" While Novotelnov rebuilt his home and his life, his father was in a gulag, serving a six-year sentence for telling a joke about Soviet leaders. He died before being released. But despite all this tragedy, Novotelnov proudly served his country. He was a truck driver in the Red Army, fighting his way to Berlin in 1945. He still hangs Red Army and Communist Party posters on the walls of his living room. Today, though, under the current leadership, that pride is faltering. \"The country is divided into rich and poor,\" Novotelnov says. \"Money has become the most important thing. Nothing good has happened in Russia during Putin's time in office. I am his opponent.\" Ready For Change  The 86-year-old may not seem like a poster child for change. But if there is a fair election in Russia in March \u2014 and that's a big \"if\" \u2014 Novetelnov's vote will be counted against Putin. The anti-government demonstrations that took place in Russia last month were some of the biggest in the 20 years since the fall of the Soviet  Union. In the capital, Moscow, thousands of people marched on the streets, demanding fair elections. Many were younger, educated, middle-class Russians. They are not representative of the country as a whole \u2014 the majority of Russian citizens are older and much less well-off. Nor are many of them ready for wholesale revolution, along the lines of the Arab Spring. But during our travels across Russia, we heard more and more voices that are ready for change. The village of Sagra is a case in point. I can see what's happening in Libya. That was our path in 1991 [when the Soviet Union dissolved]. The Libyan people will live much worse than they used to live. They had social programs, they got apartments for free. Now this will stop. I already lived through those kinds of changes. Andrei Gorodilov, 39, who lives in the Russian village of Sagra, near the Ural Mountains As with so many Russian villages, visiting Sagra is like taking a step back in time. Dilapidated wood houses are set along snow-covered dirt streets. Geese wander around, honking at passing trains. Many residents have outhouses and heat their homes using wood-fired stoves. And, with a population of only about 130, there is no local police force. Last summer, Sagra residents became caught up in something resembling an inner-city turf battle. A criminal gang was heading to Sagra one night, and residents called the police from another community. Help arrived too late, though, long after the gang did. Villagers, including 56-year-old Viktor Gorodilov, fought the criminals off themselves, swinging pitchforks and firing hunting rifles. In a twist of justice not uncommon in Russia, the government charged Sagra's residents with hooliganism. It would have been a familiar story in Russia \u2014 the authorities decide who to blame, the courts agree, case closed. But Gorodilov and others in Sagra found a lawyer, and a local nonprofit, to fight for them. They got their message out on the Internet, insisting they had been neglected by the police and let down by the government. They want something different \u2014 but not revolution. Viktor's 39-year-old son, Andrei, is a third-year graduate student in economics. He would seem to be the right demographic for joining the protests in Moscow. But, he says, they scare him. He lived through political upheaval in the early 1990s, and he's not in a hurry to repeat the experience. \"I can see what's happening in Libya,\" he says. \"That was our path in 1991 [with the dissolution of the Soviet Union]. The Libyan people will live much worse than they used to live. They had social programs, they got apartments for free. Now this will stop. I already lived through those kinds of changes.\" Andrei wants more from his government, but he's patient. He was pleased to play a role in defending his father and other villagers against criminal charges. \"I have become an annoyance to our local government,\" he explains. \"We are each struggling as much as we can, each at our own pace.\" Collapse From Within That pace is slow, but the momentum is growing. Yekaterina Stepanova is a professor of philosophy and law in Yekaterinburg, the closest city to Sagra. People out in Russia's far-flung regions, she says, are unlikely to join a large-scale movement to oust a government. But Russia as it's governed today isn't sustainable. Putin will become less popular and less relevant in places like Sagra. And sometime soon, Stepanova says, there will be new leaders who will figure out how to take Russia into the modern day. She calls it a collapse from within. But collapse is not necessarily a bad thing. \"Collapse,\" she says, \"is what has to come because what we have now is not the history of this new Russia. It's still the history of the Soviet Union.\" She has a point. Russia, as we know it now, is only 20 years old \u2014 a young country with a long history that is hard to shake. But as the younger generation \u2014 a generation that has grown up without Soviet influence \u2014 comes to power, some kind of change is inevitable.",

            "article_content": "The hotly-contested Republican primary has gotten a lot of attention lately. Tuesday night, President Obama has a chance to reclaim the spotlight. He's delivering his annual State of the Union address. It's a high-profile platform for the president as he tries to frame the choice facing voters in November.  DAVID GREENE, HOST: This is MORNING EDITION from NPR News. Good morning. I'm David Greene. RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: And I'm Renee Montagne. President Obama reclaims the spotlight tonight from his Republican rivals when he delivers his State of the Union address. As NPR's Scott Horsley reports, the president will try to frame the choice voters face in November. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: The Obama re-election campaign is trying to make the most of tonight's address. It's organizing house parties where supporters can get together to watch the speech. And over the weekend, Mr. Obama sent a video preview to followers, saying he wants an economy that works for everyone, not just a wealthy few. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: On Tuesday night, I'm going to talk about how we'll get there. I'm going to lay out a blueprint for an economy that's built to last. HORSLEY: That blueprint will include several key pillars, including manufacturing, domestic energy, and worker training. Mr. Obama will urge Congress to work with him on those issues. But he also promised, in his weekly radio address, to act on his own when necessary. OBAMA: I will continue to work with Congress, states, and leaders in the private sector to find ways to move this country forward. But where they can't act or won't act, I will. Because we want the world to know that America is open for business. HORSLEY: Political analyst Jack Pitney of Claremont McKenna College says tonight's nationally televised speech is a good platform for Mr. Obama. But it's one he has to use carefully. JACK PITNEY: The president needs to draw a contrast between himself and the Republicans and at the same time come across as presidential, as someone who is president of all the people. That's a difficult rhetorical feat. But President Obama is very rhetorically skilled. Mr. Obama is likely to tout some notable foreign policy accomplishments, such as ending the war in Iraq, beginning the troop draw-down in Afghanistan, and most importantly, killing Osama bin Laden. HORSLEY: But it's the economy that's likely to dominate tonight's speech, as well as the November election. White House spokesman Jay Carney says middle-class families are still feeling an economic squeeze, even as the country slowly recovers from the deep downturn of the last few years. JAY CARNEY: This theme about economic insecurity for the middle class is what got this president into politics. And he thinks that overwhelmingly the American people share his view that we need to have everyone play by the same rules, whether it's Wall Street or Main Street. And we need to have a tax system that ensures that everyone pays their fair share. HORSLEY: That populist tax message may get some extra attention today, with Republican presidential hopeful Mitt Romney's release of his 2010 tax return. Mr. Obama has argued it's not fair that wealthy investors sometimes pay a lower tax rate than many middle class families. OBAMA: It's wrong that in the United States of America a teacher or a nurse or construction worker, maybe earns $50,000 a year, should pay a higher tax rate than somebody raking in $50 million. (SOUNDBITE OF APPLAUSE) HORSLEY: That's the president last month in Osawatomie, Kansas, a speech that telegraphed many of the themes we're likely to hear tonight and throughout the presidential campaign. Mr. Obama is defending an activist Teddy Roosevelt-style of government while rejecting the unfettered market model championed by many of today's Republicans. OBAMA: Our success has never just been about survival of the fittest. It's about building a nation where we're all better off. We pull together. We pitch in. We do our part. HORSLEY: Fifty-two million Americans tuned in for Mr. Obama's first speech to a joint session of Congress three years ago. Since then, the audience has dropped off some, but it's still a big prime-time opportunity. Even with all those eyeballs, though, political analyst Pitney says this kind of speech rarely alters the political landscape. PITNEY: The State of the Union isn't a battle. It's merely the opening shot in a long war. And we're going to see a lot of other skirmishes in the months ahead. HORSLEY: Indeed, Mr. Obama sets off tomorrow on a three-day trip in which he'll be amplify the themes of tonight's speech in five different battleground states.

            "article_content": "Former International Monetary Fund chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn is being questioned by French police for his alleged involvement in a hotel prostitution ring. A lawyer for Strauss-Kahn says the former French presidential hopeful never knew the women at orgies he attended were prostitutes.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: We have more news for you today about Dominique Strauss-Kahn. You remember him, the former International Monetary Fund chief arrested last year and then released in a sexual assault case involving a New York hotel housekeeper. Now Mr. Strauss-Kahn faces new sexual misconduct allegations in France. He spent last night in a police holding cell and is being questioned again today. Eleanor Beardsley reports on his latest troubles. (SOUNDBITE OF NEWS BROADCAST) ELEANOR BEARDSLEY, BYLINE: Once again, Dominique Strauss-Kahn is back in the news in France. This time, the former International Monetary Fund head is accused of being involved in a high-class prostitution ring operating in France and Belgium. French investigators suspect that a circle of business executives, in collusion with senior police officers, ran a network supplying escorts girls to sex parties that took place in Paris and Washington, D.C. By his own admission, Strauss-Kahn participated in some of these libertine soirees, as they're being called. But he could face fines and serious prison time if it turns out he knew the women were prostitutes or knew that the parties and travel were funded by large French corporations. In France, it's illegal to use embezzled funds to pay prostitutes. CHRISTOPHER MESNOOH: He's being heard on both of these charges: the procurement of prostitutes and the possession or misuse of corporate assets. BEARDSLEY: That's Christopher Mesnooh, an American lawyer who practices in France. French police questioned Strauss-Kahn for nine hours yesterday, and will continue today. Strauss-Kahn's lawyers say he did not know the women were prostitutes, and is eager to refute the allegations. (SOUNDBITE OF NEWS BROADCAST) BEARDSLEY: Watching the news reports showing journalists camped out in front of the police station and swarming around Strauss-Kahn's car, you can't help feeling a sense of astonishment that a man could fall so far, so fast. Just one year ago, Strauss-Kahn was considered one of the world's most competent economists and the next French president. In May, that all fell apart when he was arrested in New York for allegedly assaulting a hotel housekeeper. Those charges were dropped, but new allegations dogged him when he returned to France. Today, the French presidential race goes on without Strauss-Kahn, and no one even mentions his name, unless it's for a laugh. Journalist Jean-Marc Illouz says Strauss-Kahn's troubles are no longer taken seriously. JEAN-MARC ILLOUZ: Well, obviously, this time DSK is no longer a political story, but only a court, a society story that reflects very poorly on the French political class in the middle of an election at a time when the economic situation is the thing that most matters. BEARDSLEY: Though the French now seem numb to Strauss-Kahn's sex-capades, when the story broke last year in New York, it mattered a lot. The Strauss-Kahn saga divided people and shook up society. Lawyer Christopher Mesnooh says the scandal may have changed some things for good in France. MESNOOH: I think it really has forced people here into thinking about where to put the line between how far do you go in protecting private life and how much information does the public have a right to know about its politicians. BEARDSLEY: Eight people so far have been charged in the investigation into the prostitution ring. Analysts say whatever happens to Dominique Strauss-Kahn, his sex scandals have profoundly shaken the French people's confidence in their politicians when strong leadership has never been needed more.

She would be South Korea's first female president.\n                \n                    \n                    Jung Yeon-Je/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption South Korean presidential candidate Park Geun-hye, who appears slightly favored in Wednesday's election, is the daughter of a military dictator who ran the country for nearly two decades. She would be South Korea's first female president. Her presidential campaign rallies present blaring pop music and dancing supporters, but Park Geun-hye's campaign involves managing some tricky legacies. Her father, Park Chung-hee, was a military dictator who ran the country from the time he carried out a 1961 military coup until his assassination in 1979. His memory still stirs mixed emotions among South Koreans. In September, the daughter publicly apologized for her father's suppression of democracy. Then again, some older Koreans remember Park fondly for his role in transforming their war-torn, impoverished country into the world's 11th largest economy. Park Geun-hye's spokesperson Cho Yoon-sun explains the Park family legacy. \"She will take all those pains that her father's regime left, and she will give all those gifts and all those contributions to the people that were made by her father,\" Cho says. Cho points out Park's record as a five-term lawmaker and leader of the New Frontier Party. The party changed its name this year to distance it from the unpopular legacy of outgoing President Lee Myung-bak and steer it toward the political center. Park, 60, who would be the country's first female president, has promised a raft of benefits for women, in order to get them into the workforce and keep them there. She is no feminist, nor has she ever married or had children. Seoul National University law professor Eom Ho Keon, who is attending a Park rally, says this gives her a certain advantage. Moon Jae-in, a former human rights lawyer, is also a leading candidate in Wednesday's election. A former presidential chief of staff, he's shown here at a presidential debate on Dec. 4.\n                \n                    \n                    Song Kyung-Seok-Pool/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Moon Jae-in, a former human rights lawyer, is also a leading candidate in Wednesday's election. A former presidential chief of staff, he's shown here at a presidential debate on Dec. 4. \"In the past, there have been a lot of family corruption scandals, with leaders trying to amass fortunes to pass on to their descendants,\" Eom says. \"Ms. Park has no financial ambitions, and no offspring to give her money to. She only wants to work for the people.\" Liberal Opponent Challenges Corporate Power The latest polls show Park with a slim lead over her liberal rival Moon Jae-in, a former human rights lawyer who was the chief of staff for the left-leaning President Roh Moo-hyun, who served from 2003-2008. Moon was jailed in the 1970s for protesting the rule of Park's father. At a recent campaign rally, Moon assailed the ruling party as an extension of the chaebol, the family-owned conglomerates, which include Hyundai and Samsung. Critics say they have reaped most of the spoils of Korea's economic growth. \"Is this a government that prioritizes conglomerates and corporate profits, or a government of the people? Is this a government that puts its own power first, or puts people first?\" Moon says. Seoul National University political scientist Kang Won-taek says that this election is the first in 25 years in which there are only two major contenders to choose from, Park on the right and Moon on the left. \"This is not only a competition between two candidates, but also it's a showdown between two ideological blocks. So ideological tendencies matter more,\" Kang says. Policies seem to matter less, Kang says, because the two candidates' prescriptions are so similar. Both advocate greater welfare spending, which is low compared with other developed economies. Both say they will pursue policies of engagement with North Korea, avoiding all-out confrontation or appeasement. Kang says the lack of a third party and independent candidates is frustrating for voters who want an alternative. \"It's a sort of political and electoral cartel between the two major parties,\" Kang says. \"And that's why many people are sick and tired of these current political and party systems.\"",

The draft constitution has deeply divided Egyptians. The second round of voting will take place this Saturday.  DAVID GREENE, HOST: Now, to the unfolding political events in Egypt. Unofficial results show the country's controversial draft constitution was narrowly approved in the first stage of a referendum held on Saturday. But there are reports of irregularities and calls by prominent Egyptian rights groups for the results to be thrown out. Those calls have gone unanswered as the Islamist government prepares for the second and last stage of the referendum to be held later this week. NPR's Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson reports from Cairo. SORAYA SARHADDI NELSON, BYLINE: The draft constitution has deeply divided Egyptians. Its supporters claim the document provides their country with a badly needed roadmap. Opponents argue that it leaves too much power in the hands of the president and armed forces, while chipping away at Egypt's historically secular identity. The Islamist government's hastily arranged referendum on the constitution is heightening tensions. Complaints about fraud emerged even before the first stage of the vote drew to a close late Saturday night. TAQADOM AL KHATEEB: (Foreign language spoken) NELSON: At a news conference here, Egyptian activist Taqadom al Khateeb charged that ballots given to many voters lacked the requisite government stamp, rendering them invalid. Hatid claimed some judges said the ballots will be stamped later. That left open the possibility that any votes election officials didn't like would end up tossed. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: (Foreign language spoken) NELSON: Unstamped ballots let to arguments like this one NPR witnessed outside a polling station in old Cairo. There were other problems reported, as well. Hundreds of female voters in the northern port city of Alexandria blocked a major road after a polling station supervisor allegedly refused to let them in to cast ballots. Nevertheless, millions of Egyptian voters were determined to have their say. (SOUNDBITE OF CROWD CHATTER) UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: (Foreign language spoken) NELSON: Lines stretched for blocks at this polling station in the Cairo enclave of Heliopolis. (SOUNDBITE OF HORN HONKING) UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: (Foreign language spoken) NELSON: A half-hour drive away in the middle-class neighborhood of Manial, housewife Ghada Metwally explained why she came out. GHADA METWALLY: I'm thinking about my child, not about me. I am talking about the future. We are afraid about our children, so we have to vote either yes or no. NELSON: She declined to say how she voted. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: (Foreign language spoken) NELSON: In Old Cairo, computer programmer Ahmed Kamel said it was exciting to be voting on a post-revolution constitution. He added: For the first time, I feel like we are making a difference. The government won't release the official outcome of Saturday's vote until the referendum is over. But based on unofficial reports from political parties that monitor the polls, the draft constitution was approved by roughly 57 percent of the voters who turned out. A yes vote is also expected in the final stage of the referendum next Saturday. Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson, NPR News, Cairo. Copyright \u00a9 2012 NPR.  All rights reserved.

STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: It's MORNING EDITION, from NPR News. I'm Steve Inskeep. LINDA WERTHEIMER, HOST: And I'm Linda Wertheimer, in for Renee Montagne. President Obama continues to insist that any agreement to avoid the so-called fiscal cliff next year must include higher taxes on the wealthy. In his first White House news conference since winning reelection, though, the president left the door open to structuring that tax increase in various ways. He's hoping to strike a bargain with congressional Republicans that would prevent a broader tax hike on the middle-class that could send the country back into recession. NPR's Scott Horsley reports. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: President Obama is set to meet tomorrow with leaders of Congress, both Democrats and Republicans. With the election now behind us, he says, it's time for both parties to set aside their most stubborn talking points and climb down from the fiscal cliff. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) HORSLEY: The president is not surrendering his own demand, though, that people earning more than a quarter-million dollars a year should pay more in taxes. That was a point he made repeatedly throughout the campaign, and a key difference with his Republican rival Mitt Romney. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) HORSLEY: But Mr. Obama told reporters gathered in the White House East Room there are various ways to meet that goal. Asked if he'd insist on higher tax rates - a non-starter for many Republicans - Mr. Obama said he's open to new ideas. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) HORSLEY: Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell also yielded slightly to the election results, hinting he might be open to higher taxes on the rich, if he gets something in return. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) HORSLEY: But if that sounds like the makings of a grand bargain, there's still plenty of friction between Mr. Obama and his Republican adversaries. It reached a boiling point yesterday on the subject of Libya. Senator Lindsey Graham and others demanded a Watergate-style investigation of the attack in Benghazi, Libya that killed four Americans, including U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens. Graham is angry that during a round of Sunday talk shows days after that attack, U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice failed to label it an act of terrorism. Graham vowed to block any effort to promote Rice to replace Hillary Clinton as secretary of state. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) HORSLEY: Mr. Obama has yet to nominate anyone for the top State Department job, but he angrily defended his U.N. ambassador. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) HORSLEY: Mr. Obama was also asked yesterday about other priorities for his second term, including immigration reform. He says he expects to introduce a bill soon after the inauguration. And he thinks it will garner more Republican support next year, as the GOP tries to win back votes among the fast-growing Latino population. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) HORSLEY: Mr. Obama says he'll also look for new ways to tackle climate change, though he added a carbon tax is probably not politically possible for now. Mr. Obama acknowledged that despite his reelection, many voters still disagree with him. And he promised to be careful to avoid second-term overreach. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) HORSLEY: Mr. Obama says his only mandate is to help middle class families and those trying to break into the middle class. Scott Horsley, NPR News, Washington.

Eight days after his re-election \u2014 with the fiscal cliff looming, questions being raised about the deadly attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya, and a scandal having forced the director of the CIA to resign \u2014 President Obama today told reporters \"I didn't re-elected just to bask in re-election. I got re-elected to do work.\" In his first full-scale Q&A with White House reporters since March, the president signaled there may be some room for compromise on taxes. While he repeated that the wealthiest Americans must be asked to do more and that the middle class can't be left footing any such bill, Obama also did not insist on raising tax rates for the wealthiest to Clinton-era rates. He said that \"comprehensive\" immigration reform legislation will be on Capitol Hill soon after Inauguration Day. And in the most-heated moment, he defended U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice against criticism of things she said after the attack on the American consulate in Benghazi, Libya. If Republicans \"want to go after somebody, they should go after me,\" he said. \"To besmirch her reputation is outrageous.\" While not saying whether he will or won't nominate her to be secretary of state, the president said that if he did he would push hard for her confirmation. The scandal that has obsessed Washington for the past five days \u2014 the extramarital affair that led to CIA Director David Petraeus's resignation last Friday \u2014 came up, but was only the subject of a few questions. The president said he has no evidence at this time that national security was imperiled by that scandal. He also said he's withholding judgment on whether the FBI should have informed him sooner about the investigation. We posted updates during the news conference. Scroll down and read \"up\" if you want to see how it unfolded. Update at 2:25 p.m. ET. To Get U.S. Support, Syrian Opposition Must Be \"Democratic ... Inclusive ... Moderate\": The final question is about Syria and whether the U.S. will arm the opposition to President Bashar Assad. The president talks again about how the U.S. has long insisted that Assad must go, says that he is encouraged by the recent formation of another coalition of opponents, and that to get American support the opposition must be \"committed to a democratic Syria, an inclusive Syria, a moderate Syria.\" As the president steps away, a reporter from Bloomberg News shouts out a question about whether lawmakers might kick the fiscal cliff can down the road. Obama jokes that it's an excellent question, but he would set a terrible precedent if he answered one after the news conference is officially over. And with that, he turns to leave. Update at 2:22 p.m. ET. Climate Change Agenda Must Be Paired With Job Growth: If lawmakers can come up with plans to \"create jobs, advance growth and make a serious dent in climate change,\" Obama says, \"I think that's something the American people would support.\" He says he'll focus on combining those elements. Update at 2:15 p.m. ET. Will Push For Dialogue With Iran: \"I will try to make a push in coming months to see if we can open a dialogue\" with Iran and the international community about that nation's nuclear ambitions, Obama says. \"We're not going to let Iran get a nuclear weapon,\" he adds, but \"there is still a window of time for us to resolve this diplomatically.\" Update at 2:13 p.m. ET. \"Stubbornness\" Could Push Us Over The Fiscal Cliff: What might push the federal government over that precipice? \"If there's too much stubbornness\" in Congress, the president says. Update at 2:10 p.m. ET. Understands \"Overreach,\" But Is There \"To Do Work\": After saying he's aware that some presidents have been guilty of \"overreach\" in their second terms, the president adds that \"on the other hand I didn't re-elected just to bask in re-election. I got re-elected to do work.\" Update at 2:08 p.m. ET. \"Outrageous\" To Besmirch Amb. Rice's Reputation: Some heat comes into the president's voice when he's asked about comments by Republican senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham that they would oppose the nomination of U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice to be secretary of state. They have been critical of things she said after the Benghazi attack about what led to that tragic incident that cost 4 Americans their lives. \"She gave her best understanding of the intelligence that had been provided to her,\" the president says. \"If Sen. McCain and Sen. Graham and others want to go after somebody, they should go after me. ... To besmirch her reputation is outrageous.\" Update at 2:02 p.m. ET. Wants To Do \"Even Better\": \"I hope and intend to be an even better president in the second term than I was in the first,\" Obama says. Update at 2 p.m. ET. Romney Might Have Good Ideas On Making Government Work Better: After his re-election, the president said he wants to meet with Republican nominee Mitt Romney before year's end. \"I do think he did a terrific job running the [Salt Lake] Olympics,\" Obama says. And Romney's skill at making something like that work better, \"applies to the federal government.\" Update at 1:57 p.m. ET. On Tax Rates, No \"Red Lines\": Asked if there's \"no deal\" with Republicans unless tax rates for the wealthiest go back to Clinton-era levels, the president doesn't say yes or no. Instead, he says \"I am open to new ideas\" from Republicans or Democrats. What he won't accept, Obama adds, are \"vague\" ideas that eventually force lawmakers to ask the middle class to do more. \"I'm less concerned about red lines, per se,\" he says, than ending up in a situation where the wealthiest Americans aren't paying \"as much as they should\" and the middle class is being asked to do more to cut the deficit and reduce the debt. Update at 1:53 p.m. ET. \"Comprehensive\" Immigration Legislation \"Very Soon After My Inauguration\": \"We will get a bill introduced ... and begin the process in Congress ... very soon after my inauguration,\" the president says after being asked about immigration reform. The elements, he says, will include further strengthening of border security, \"serious penalities for companies\" that hire illegals, and \"a pathway for legal status for those who are living in this country, not engaged in criminal activity and are here simply to work.\" Update at 1:46 p.m. ET. On Taxes, Why Won't he \"Cave Again?\" Asked why Americans should think he'll stand firm against extending the \"Bush tax cuts\" for the wealthiest taxpayers \u2014 since he \"caved in\" once before \u2014 Obama says that \"two years ago, the economy was in a different situation. ... What I said at the time is what I meant \u2014 that [it] was a one-time proposition\" when he agreed to extend the tax cuts for everyone. \"We cannot afford to extend the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy,\" the president adds. He won't \"extend a tax cuts for folks who don't need it\" when deficit-reduction is so important. Update at 1:42 p.m. ET. Did CIA Director David Petraeus's Affair Threaten National Security? \"I have no evidence, at this point ... that classified information was disclosed in any way that would have an impact on national security,\" Obama says. On whether he and the American people should have been told before Election Day about the investigation of Petraeus, Obama says he will let the FBI determine whether its notification protocols are appropriate and were followed. Update at 1:37 p.m. ET. On The Economy And The Fiscal Cliff: The president begins his opening remarks with subjects he probably hopes will come up a lot. \"Our economy is still recovering from a very deep and damaging crisis, so our top priority has to be creating jobs,\" he says. And on the \"fiscal cliff,\" he says that \"both parties can work together\" to keep taxes from going up on everyone and to prevent deep spending cuts across most federal programs. He's been encouraged by some of the things he's heard from Republicans, Obama says, and says he wants to repeat that he's open to others' ideas.",

With that win, Baldwin became Wisconsin's first openly gay Senator.\n                \n                    \n                    Darren Hauck/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption U.S. Rep. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., celebrates her victory over Republican Tommy Thompson on election night in Madison, Wis. With that win, Baldwin became Wisconsin's first openly gay Senator. Democratic Congresswoman Tammy Baldwin's sexual orientation was never really a factor in her victorious campaign against Republican former Gov. Tommy Thompson. Advocates for gay rights see that as a watershed moment for the movement. Baldwin won a seat many thought she couldn't, defeating one of the state's most successful politicians in the process. The celebration Tuesday night in Madison was euphoric. The enthusiastic crowd was never louder than when Baldwin acknowledged making history. \"I am well aware that I will be the first openly gay member of the U.S. Senate,\" she said. Not About Being Gay Afterward, supporters like Linda Willsey remained \"sky-high.\" \"Dreams do come true in politics,\" says Willsey, who has known Baldwin for more than 25 years. \"The fact that she's the first openly lesbian woman candidate to win a U.S. Senate seat is great, but that's not why she won,\" she says. \"It wasn't even an issue in this race.\" In fact, the words \"gay candidate\" were rarely \u2014 if ever \u2014 spoken on the campaign trail. Baldwin, instead, mostly talked about two other words: \"middle class.\" Analysts say Baldwin won primarily on the same issues as President Obama in Wisconsin, including the economy. \"No one was questioning whether or not she could lead because of her sexual orientation, and that's so amazing,\" says Katie Belanger, executive director of Fair Wisconsin, a statewide gay rights advocacy group. Belanger says the fact that Wisconsin voters didn't seem to care about Baldwin's sexual orientation \u2014 combined with Tuesday's victories for marriage equality in neighboring Minnesota and in three other states \u2014 represents a major step forward. \"I think that when we look back on the movement for LGBT equality, we're going to look at Nov. 6, 2012, as a significant turning point, if not the turning point in this movement,\" she says. Joining The Conversation For Baldwin, the milestone of being the first openly gay candidate elected to the U.S. Senate is the latest in a series of firsts. She was the first openly gay candidate elected to the Wisconsin Assembly, and the first openly gay non-incumbent elected to Congress. Based on those experiences, Baldwin says this historic election changes things in one specific way. \"If you are not in the room, the conversation is about you. If you're in the room, the conversation is with you, and that ... has a very transformative effect,\" she says. Baldwin says she doesn't have a specific gay-rights agenda she'll immediately push in the Senate. She says her top priority will be the issues she talked about in the campaign, including preserving Medicare, middle-class tax cuts, creating jobs and fixing the economy. But she also notes that what happened Tuesday reflects a \"sea change\" in voters' attitudes toward gays, lesbians and marriage equality in just a few short years. \"There were several glass ceilings smashed on Tuesday, and ... I'm proud to have been one of those,\" she says. To be sure, Baldwin and others say the gay-rights movement still has a long way to go, but never before has it gained so much on one Election Day.",

If you fell asleep Rip Van Winkle-like earlier in the year only to wake up Friday, you might be forgiven for thinking no time had passed. Because on Friday, President Obama called for higher taxes on the wealthy to be part of any agreement to avoid the fiscal cliff, while House Speaker John Boehner strongly indicated that proposal was a non-starter with House Republicans. But, of course, we just had an election in which the president won a second term and, through that, some political capital. Exactly how much remains to be seen. So with the president's big \u2014 and, to many Republicans, unexpected \u2014 win Tuesday in the Electoral College behind him, Obama made an offer he's counting on Boehner finding hard to refuse in the coming, tense negotiations over a deficit-cutting deal. The president proposed that Republicans should immediately agree to extend the middle-class tax cuts scheduled to expire at the end of the year while discussions continue on a more comprehensive agreement to avert the spending cuts and tax increases due to take effect in the new year, the so-called fiscal cliff, which experts warn could return the U.S. economy to recession. At a White House event that featured a diverse group of people standing on risers behind him, which gave the appearance that for the White House, Tuesday was just a pause in the presidential campaign, Obama said: \"So let's not wait. Even as we're negotiating a broader deficit reduction package, let's extend the middle-class tax cuts right now. Let's do that right now. \"That one step, that one step would give millions of families, 98 percent of Americans and 97 percent of small businesses, the certainty that they need going into the new year. It would immediately take a huge chunk of the economic uncertainty off the table. And that will lead to new jobs and faster growth. Business will know that consumers, they're not going to see a big tax increase. They'll know that most small businesses won't see this increase. And so a lot of uncertainty that you're reading about, that will be removed.\" Not only did Obama have Tuesday's Electoral College and popular vote on his side, he also had exit polling. Sixty percent of voters surveyed said they thought taxes should be increased on either all taxpayers or those with more than $250,000 in annual income. Even a significant minority of voters who backed Republican Mitt Romney \u2014 29 percent \u2014 agreed that taxes should be raised on those with income over $250,000. Because Romney made opposition to raising tax rates on the superwealthy part of his campaign, Obama seemed to interpret his defeat of his GOP challenger as a referendum on this point: \"And I just want to point out, this was a central question during the election. It was debated over and over again. And on Tuesday night, we found out that the majority of Americans agree with my approach. And that includes Democrats, independents and a lot of Republicans across the country, as well as independent economists and budget experts.\" Obama was clearly trying to pressure Republicans by putting on the table an extension of the middle-class tax cuts that were part of tax-reduction packages enacted by his predecessor, George W. Bush. By calling for an immediate extension of the middle-class tax cuts, Obama was attempting to paint congressional Republicans into a corner. While he didn't say it, the implication was clear: If taxes go up next year on millions of middle-income earners, Obama will blame Republican resistance to raising tax rates on the wealthy as the cause. House Speaker John Boehner arrives for a news conference on Capitol Hill on Friday.\n                \n                    \n                    Susan Walsh/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption House Speaker John Boehner arrives for a news conference on Capitol Hill on Friday. The president's proposal was reminiscent of earlier tactical moves in his presidency. When Bush-era tax cuts were due to expire at the end of 2010, for instance, the president linked an extension of those cuts to a renewal of long-term unemployment insurance. Republicans initially balked, but a deal was reached as the deadline approached that extended the jobless benefits. The tax cuts were extended as well for two years, including cuts for the wealthiest taxpayers. If Republican leaders on Capitol Hill were feeling any pressure from the president's gambit, it wasn't readily apparent. On election night, Boehner offered this interpretation of the election returns while speaking at the Republican National Committee: \"The American people want solutions \u2014 and tonight, they've responded by renewing our House Republican majority. With this vote, the American people have also made clear that there is no mandate for raising tax rates.\" On Friday, after the president cited legislation he supports and that the Democratic-controlled Senate passed that would raise rates on those with the highest income, Boehner said: \"The increased tax rates that would be allowed under the Senate-passed bill are part of the fiscal cliff that economists are warning us to avoid. Those increased tax rates will destroy jobs in America by hurting small businesses across the country. Republicans are eager to get to work on an agreement that averts the entire fiscal cliff.\" While the words from Obama and Boehner on Friday could be properly viewed as the two men staking out opening positions in the coming negotiations over solving the fiscal cliff, they also could be seen as addressing the two very different constituencies the men must answer to. Obama won re-election largely because of support from a coalition of more progressive supporters in urban and suburban areas, many of them minorities and women, who came out for him on Tuesday and during early voting in the weeks before. Boehner, meanwhile, retained his House majority largely because of strong support in congressional districts with primarily white voters in conservative suburban and rural areas. It's that disconnect in their constituencies that helps explain much of the difference in the opening salvos of Obama and Boehner. They'll have a chance to see if there's common ground starting next Friday, when Obama has asked Boehner and other congressional leaders to join him at the White House for talks.",

            "article_content": "The nation's economy has been rebuilding since the recession ended in 2009, and in this election, the economy was a central issue from the beginning. Unemployment stands at 7.9 percent \u2014 slightly higher than when President Obama took office. In the end, the president handily rolled to re-election vowing to complete the country's recovery.  RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: The economy has been a central issue in this presidential election, but it has been improving little by little. In the end, President Obama handily rolled to reelection, pledging, last night, to complete the country's recovery. For more, we turn to economic correspondent John Ydstie. Good morning. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: Hi, Renee. MONTAGNE: Now, the weak economy was what Republicans hoped would unseat the president and that did not happen. What are the reasons for that? YDSTIE: Well, it has been an historically weak recovery but there has been real growth during this election year. Unemployment has come down significantly, though it's still very high. But I think, historically, when an incumbent is running, the direction of these economic indicators is as important as their actual level. Also, the exit polls showed the top issue on people's minds wasn't the economy. But those polls also showed a majority of people thought President Obama's policies favored the poor and the middle-class, while Romney's favored the rich. I think that suggests people didn't embrace the alternative path that Governor Romney was offering. MONTAGNE: Now, the business community largely supported Governor Romney in this election. What impact will the fact that President Obama has been reelected have on the pace of economic growth? YDSTIE: Well, you know, one thing a lot of business people have said during the past year, is that despite the fact that they have huge amounts of cash on hand, they haven't been investing because of uncertainty about what tax policies they'd face, about whether Obamacare would be repealed or fully come into effect. Well, a lot of that uncertainty has been removed. I think its clear Obamacare is here to stay. Businesses are going to have to figure out how to deal with it. The president's view on taxes is more likely to become a reality, which would mean more taxes on the wealthy. So businesses may be more ready to move forward with investment now than they have been in the past, because they have a better sense of what the ground rules are likely to be. I don't think we're going to see a big jump in the growth rate as a result, but maybe some incremental increase in the pace of growth. However, some business maybe incentivized to try harder to grow without adding workers, since the healthcare law now makes those workers more expensive. So, creating jobs could still be a struggle. MONTAGNE: Well, businesses always do say certainty is good. But there is one very big uncertainty that's still with us. And that is the fiscal cliff, which we talk so much about but it is, right now, staring the president and Congress right in the face. YDSTIE: That's right, Renee. The fiscal cliff is that huge hit of automatic tax increases and spending cuts that's due to take effect at the end of the year - actually the first of January, six hundred billion dollars worth and there's a lot of concern it could throw the economy back into recession, if the president and Congress don't produce an alternative plan for reining in deficits. The challenge is that the political balance hasn't changed. My understanding is that the president will present a plan to Congress, as it returns next week - hope it gets passed in the Senate, then it would be up to the House. If the House balks because there are tax increases, it's possible the president could allow the government to go over the fiscal cliff. That would mean automatic increases in taxes, as the Bush era tax cuts expire. And that would set up a situation where it would be possible to get a deal without anyone voting for tax hike, because you'd be starting from a point where taxes have already been increased. But it's a risky strategy. MONTAGNE: Well, one thing we do know, now that President Obama has been reelected, is that Ben Bernanke will stay on as the chairman of the Federal Reserve. Does that provide any comfort to the market? YDSTIE: I think it does. And I think the stock market has built its games in recent months on easy money. And if President Obama keeps - or if Mr. Romney had gotten rid of him that would've been a problem for the markets. MONTAGNE: John, thanks very much, NPR's economic correspondent John Ydstie.

            "article_content": "Wisconsin voters chose the Obama ticket over their own native son Paul Ryan. And the state is sending the first openly gay senator to Washington: Tammy Baldwin defeated former Governor Tommy Thompson for the seat of retiring Senator Herb Kohl.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: It's MORNING EDITION, from NPR News. I'm Steve Inskeep. RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: And I'm Renee Montagne. In Wisconsin, Democrats won big just five months after a stinging defeat in their effort to recall Republican Governor Scott Walker. President Obama won the state, even though Mitt Romney chose Wisconsin Congressman Paul Ryan as his running mate. Plus Wisconsin voters elected Democrat Tammy Baldwin to be the first openly gay member of the U.S. Senate. From Madison, NPR's David Schaper reports. DAVID SCHAPER, BYLINE: The dreary, cold and rainy Election Day weather in Janesville, Wisconsin didn't dampen the enthusiasm of Lisa Hinkleman(ph) . LISA HINKLEMAN: Oh, I'm excited. SCHAPER: Excited about the possibility of electing one of her neighbors vice president of the United States. HINKLEMAN: I love Paul Ryan. I was disappointed. I didn't vote till 10, and I heard he was here, like, 8:30. So I was very disappointed that I didn't see him. SCHAPER: Despite missing her congressman when he voted here at the Janesville public library just a couple of blocks from the Ryan home, Hinkleman says Ryan brought much-needed conservatism to the Republican ticket this year, and... HINKLEMAN: Who knows? Maybe he'll be president some day. SCHAPER: In fact, every Romney voter I talked to said they love Paul Ryan. But there are several neighbors of Ryan who aren't quite as enthusiastic. DAVE CARLSON: I think that he's a fine person. I know him. SCHAPER: Dave Carlson goes to church with Ryan, and has even coached Ryan's kids, and despite voting for Ryan in the past, Carlson says he didn't vote for him this time. CARLSON: I think that people in this district have learned a lot more about where his allegiances lie, what his policies imply, as a result of the national attention being focused on his road map for America. SCHAPER: And, in fact, the Romney-Ryan ticket lost Ryan's home town and county pretty decisively. But Ryan will return to Congress, as he won reelection to the House from his wide, southern Wisconsin district. And moving up from the House to the U.S. Senate is Democrat Tammy Baldwin.  She makes history as the first openly gay member elected to the Senate. But that's not why William Abraham of Janesville voted for her. WILLIAM ABRAHAM: I come down for the Labor Day parade and she, you know, I asked her a question, she actually took time to stop and talk to me about it. So I believe, you know, she's true middle class, and that's - we need more people for the middle class people. SCHAPER: Baldwin defeated former four-term Wisconsin governor Tommy Thompson, one of this state's most successful politicians ever, but one who's popularity has clearly has faded.

            "article_content": "Voters have given President Obama a second term in office. He defeated Republican Mitt Romney in a hard-fought race in which the economy was the dominant issue. In the end, Obama narrowly won the popular vote but captured more than 300 electoral votes to Romney's 206.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: It's MORNING EDITION, from NPR News. I'm Steve Inskeep. RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: And I'm Renee Montagne. It was well after midnight, but considerably earlier than some expected when President Obama strode on stage in Chicago. A closely fought campaign resolved itself in a clear reelection for the president. He won a little over half the popular vote. And as of this morning's count, with Florida still undecided, more than 300 electoral votes. Democrats maintain control of the Senate, while Republicans held control of the House. INSKEEP: OK. Now let's talk about the results of that campaign with NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson, who's watched it all. She's in our studios. Mara, good morning. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Good morning. INSKEEP: OK. People talked about a very close election - not really that close in the end. LIASSON: Nope. It wasn't a squeaker. It was a race that was supposed to be a tie, dead even. We heard about the possibility of recounts. But in the end, the president won the popular vote narrowly, and he won the Electoral College by a landslide. He held all the states except North Carolina and Indiana that he had one last time, and he did it all shortly after midnight. INSKEEP: He held so many states, that even if there had been some massive dispute over a single state, it wouldn't have made a difference in the final results. So how did he manage to win so strongly? LIASSON: Well, I think you could say the demographics trumped the undertow of a weak recovery. The president was able to fight Romney to a draw on the question of who's better for the economy. He also took full advantage of the changing demographics in the country. He built a sophisticated ground game to get out his supporters, particularly Latinos, young people, African-Americans. The auto bailout helped him win Ohio. And we shouldn't forget that relentless campaign that he waged to paint Romney as out of touch with the middle class. INSKEEP: Well, in his victory speech this morning, actually, he talked about how some people might have found the campaign to be small or silly, but that he felt that it was about larger things. LIASSON: That's right. And in his victory speech in Chicago he thanked every American who participated in the election. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) LIASSON: The Obama campaign proved its supporters are now part of a mature movement, able to get to the polls even after the novelty and euphoria of the 2008 campaign had evaporated. Mr. Obama told them there would be more hard, frustrating work ahead. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) LIASSON: And he sketched out his priorities for a second term, which will involve working once again with a Republican House and a slim majority of Democrats in the Senate. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) LIASSON: Romney, from Boston, called the president to congratulate him, and then spoke to a roomful of somber supporters. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) LIASSON: Romney's speech was gracious. He said he prayed that the president will be successful. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) LIASSON: Romney had hoped to build a victory on an electorate that liked Mr. Obama personally, but was disappointed in his presidency, voters like Phyllis McCaugherty of Auburn, New Hampshire New Hampshire. PHYLLIS MCCAUGHERTY: We need some change. I am tired of a rock star president. LIASSON: After running as a severely conservative candidate in the primaries, Romney changed his tone in the last months of the campaign. That approach appealed to Phillip Morgan of Worcester, Massachusetts. PHILLIP MORGAN: I really believe at his core, Romney's a moderate, and has to present himself as very conservative to be elected across the country. But I don't think that's really who the man is. LIASSON: But in the end, Romney's majorities among independents and white voters were no match for the president's coalition, built on the support of voters like Opal Williams of Tampa, Florida and Jennifer Gonzales from Phoenix, Arizona. OPAL WILLIAMS: I love my president, and we need him another four years, I feel like, because I know he didn't come into office with the world all together, and I know it may take eight years to get it together. And I'm hoping he can do that this year. JENNIFER GONZALES: I know that he's going to bring more stuff towards our economy, to our people. So I trust in him a lot. LIASSON: The Obama campaign had worked for five years to build a get-out-the-vote machine, would get the Obama electorate - young, Latinos, African-American voters - to turn out in greater numbers than they did four years ago, and it succeeded. Exit polls showed that while the black vote stayed the same as a percentage of the electorate, the Latino vote got a little bit bigger than it was four years ago. So did young people. White voters, on the other hand, were 72 percent of the electorate this year, down from 74 percent in 2008. INSKEEP: We're listening to NPR's Mara Liasson. Mara, you're just talking there about a change in country. Let's ask if anything is going to change in Washington. The president spoke of reaching out to leaders of both parties. It's common when your party has been defeated, you say something gracious on Election Night, even if you're not feeling very gracious. But Mitch McConnell, the Senate minority leader, has dug right back into the battles of the last couple of years. I want to read from his statement here: It's time for the president to propose solutions that actually have a chance of passing the Republican-controlled House of Representatives - which it still will be - and a closely divided Senate, step up to the plate on the challenges of the moment and deliver in a way that he did not in his first four years in office. That's Mitch McConnell, the Senate Republican leader. Can anything really change in Washington? LIASSON: Well, I think something can change. And don't forget, John Cornyn, who is the chairman of the Senate Republican Campaign Committee, said this is going to be a time when Republicans have to recalibrate. So I think whether the gridlock gets broken now will depend on a couple of things. First of all, what kind of lessons the president learned, what kind of mandate, if any, does he think he has now. He talked about a different kind of agenda, other than passing a big new entitlement, like health care reform. He's now talking about reducing the deficit and reforming taxes and immigration. That's a different kind of agenda that really does demand compromise. And it also really depends on what lessons the Republicans learn. They're going to have to do a lot of soul-searching. Why do they think they lost? Do they think it was just because Romney wasn't a good candidate, he wasn't conservative enough, or maybe he was too tied to the Tea Party? I think this is different than if Romney had just lost in a squeaker in Ohio, and I do think Republicans are going to have to think through this and think about what they might do differently. INSKEEP: Let me drill down on one of the issues you mentioned: immigration. The president said to the Des Moines Register during the campaign, he thought that if he won reelection, that there would be an opportunity for changes on immigration, that Republicans would realize they needed to change the position because of the changing demographics of the country. When you talk with Republicans, do you hear that desire? LIASSON: Yes, among many of them. There are many Republicans that want to pass some kind of immigration reform for a variety of reasons, partly because they believe (unintelligible). Their states have big Hispanic populations, but also because they realize that they can't win the White House any longer unless they can do better with Hispanic voters. INSKEEP: I was just listening to an analyst overnight here inside NPR state that it seems that the Democrats now have the advantage, almost a lock on the White House the way that Republicans once had a lock on the White House. Your expression suggests you don't buy that. LIASSON: Yeah, well, for many years, the Republicans did have what they called an Electoral College lock. There's no doubt that demographics have shifted the advantage in the Electoral College to the Democrats. To say that it's a lock that's going to go on for forever is just not true. Obviously, the Republican... INSKEEP: We'll see what happens in a couple of years, yeah. LIASSON: ...eventually the Republicans' lock was broken. The Democrats have built up a pretty powerful coalition, pretty powerful geographic firewall for their coalition, but all those things can change. INSKEEP: Much more to discuss in the days ahead. NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson, thanks very much. LIASSON: Thank you. MONTAGNE: And you can hear election results and analysis all this morning on MORNING EDITION, from NPR News.

(Revised at 5:46 pm ET) On the final day of the 2012 campaign for the White House, President Obama and Mitt Romney are making the last push for votes in states each believes critical to achieving the 270 Electoral College votes needed for victory. Obama was scheduled to campaign in three swing states, while Romney had events planned in four. The only overlap was in Ohio, considered the linchpin of the election. Obama started the day with a morning event in Madison, Wis., the Badger State's capital, home to its flagship public university and, aside from Milwaukee, one of the most Democratic-leaning areas in the state. Then it was on to Columbus in all important Ohio for an afternoon rally. It was another state capital with a flagship state university, Ohio State University. At a rally in Columbus' Nationwide Arena, Obama outlined the choice, as he saw it, that voters faced on Election Day. OBAMA: \"Now, Ohio, tomorrow you've got a choice to make, although some of you already made the choice. How many have early voted around here? (Cheers, applause.) This is not just a choice between two candidates or two parties. It's a choice between two different visions of America. It's a choice between a return to the top-down economic policies that crashed our economy \u2014 (jeers) \u2014 or a vision that says we've got to build a strong foundation based on a strong and middle class and opportunity for everybody, not just some.\" (Cheers, applause.) The president was scheduled to end the day with a rally in Des Moines, Iowa. The symbolism was inescapable. Iowa was where Obama's presidential fortunes took flight in 2008 after he beat Hillary Clinton to win the state's Democratic caucuses. With the exception of Ohio, Obama was going to states he could probably lose and still \u2014 under credible scenarios \u2014 capture enough electoral votes to achieve a second term. Political experts have said for some time that because of states that are presumed to be either Republican or Democratic sure things, the path to an Electoral College victory is wider for Obama than Romney. Romney had events in Florida, Virginia, Ohio and New Hampshire. The first three are considered must-wins for Romney under many scenarios. Romney began the day with a rally at the airport in Orlando, Fla. Recent polls in the Sunshine State have been mixed, but many experts think Romney may have a small advantage there in part because of his leads among certain key voter groups, including older white voters, white men and Cuban Americans. After Florida, Romney had scheduled rallies in Virginia, specifically Lynchburg, in central Virginia, a conservative part of the state, and Fairfax County in Northern Virginia, the bluest part of a once reliably red state. Obama handily won Fairfax County just outside Washington, D.C., in 2008, which allowed him to become the first Democratic presidential candidate to win the state since 1964. Virginia, like Florida, is considered a state that is very close, with most recent polls within the margin of error. At the Patriot Center at George Mason University in Fairfax Country Romney, like Obama, told his supporters that voters faced a clear choice Tuesday: ROMNEY: \"And so our choice tomorrow will lead us to one of two very different outcomes. And I realize the American people are going to have that choice. I hope they recognize that there are two different places these choices will end up, because if the president were to be re-elected, he will still be unable to work with Congress. (Boos.) He \u2014 he ignored Congress. He attacked the people there. He blamed them. And, you know, there's going to be another debt ceiling that's going to come up again and again, and there will be a threat of a shutdown or default. And when that happens, the economy shrinks; people lose jobs.\" A stop in the same Ohio city Obama visited, Columbus, was also on Romney's itinerary. For Romney to win Ohio, it would help if he could reduce the margin of victory Obama enjoyed in 2008 over Sen. John McCain in Franklin County, where Columbus resides. Obama won Franklin by 21 percentage points. No Republican has won the White House without winning Ohio, which now accounts for 18 electoral votes. Recent polls virtually all give Obama the lead in the Buckeye State, though the size of his lead has narrowed appreciably. Romney was scheduled to end the day with a rally in New Hampshire. As with Obama and Iowa, there was symbolism for Romney in bringing Monday to a close in the Granite State. He has long owned a summer home there. What's more, it was on a supporter's New Hampshire farm that in 2011 he officially kicked off this, his second race for the White House. When the day started, journalists covering the Romney campaign were under the impression that Monday's late-night New Hampshire event would be the final stop of Romney's marathon effort. But Romney campaign officials surprised many on Monday by adding two additional events for Election Day itself, stops in Cleveland and Pittsburgh. (Update @9:43 pm ET: The plan is for Romney to visit campaign offices in those two cities.) Obama campaign officials indicated that they didn't intend to change their plans. Their last rally would be the one in Des Moines Monday evening. On Election Day, the plan was to have the president deliver get-out-the-vote messages via satellite TV. He would also engage in an Election Day ritual \u2014 playing basketball with friends.",

            "article_content": "President Obama is campaigning virtually around the clock this weekend. More than one-third of the country has already voted, and Obama is making his closing argument for those heading to the polls on Tuesday.  RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: This is WEEKEND EDITION from NPR News. I'm Rachel Martin. If you trace the routes that President Barack Obama and Republican Mitt Romney are traveling in these final days of the campaign, you'll see a crazy tangle of lines running north to New Hampshire, south to Florida and west to Colorado, always doubling back for repeat visits to Ohio. The speeches are getting shorter and the stops more frequent as the candidates try to cram more and more events into the remaining days. Millions of people have already cast their ballots, sometimes enduring long lines to do so. This morning, we'll hear some of the closing arguments from both campaigns. Our coverage begins with NPR's Scott Horsley. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: If your travel agent ever planned an itinerary like this, you'd fire him. But there is a certain logic to the crazy back-and-forth of a campaign's final weekend. For example, Mr. Obama's first three stops yesterday were in Ohio, Wisconsin and Iowa. If the president wins those three, along with the usual Democratic strongholds, he'll have the 270 electoral votes he needs to hang on to the White House. Polling averages suggest Mr. Obama is leading in all three states, but the margins are small. So, a big part of his mission on this frenetic final road trip is making sure his supporters and everyone they know turns out. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: If you've already early-voted, then go grab some friends and neighbors and coworkers and boyfriends and girlfriends and - now, you should convince them to vote for me before you drag them to the polls. HORSLEY: Mr. Obama is trying to do some convincing of his own. He's questioned whether voters can trust what he describes as Governor Romney's 11th hour rebranding as a moderate. And he's tried to reassure voters about his own agenda, saying after four years in office, you know me. OBAMA: You're watched me age before your eyes. And you may not agree with every decision I've made. Sometimes you may have been frustrated by the pace of change, but you know where I stand. HORSLEY: All of the states where the president campaigned yesterday have lower-than-average unemployment rates. He says the U.S. economy is on the mend but there's more work to do to build a growing and thriving American middle class. OBAMA: For eight years, we had a president who shared these beliefs. His name was Bill Clinton. HORSLEY: Mr. Obama regularly contrasts the strong job growth and broad prosperity of the Clinton years with the anemic growth and widening inequality of the decade that followed. He cast himself as the natural successor to Clinton while trying to paint Governor Romney's policies as a rerun of the trickle-down economics of George W. Bush. OBAMA: This isn't an abstract debate. We have tried our ideas and they worked. We tried their ideas and they don't work. HORSLEY: Bill Clinton himself underscored that argument when he joined Mr. Obama and 24,000 others last night at a frosty outdoor rally in Northern Virginia. PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON: I want to vote for the president who has a budget, who has a plan, that will produce broad-based prosperity. (SOUNDBITE OF CHEERING) CLINTON: I want to vote for a president who's been a good commander-in-chief and a good decider-in-chief. And I want to vote for a president who's been through the fire of these last four years and brought America out on the other side ready to take off. HORSLEY: The former president has become a kind of super-surrogate for Mr. Obama. They'll campaign together again today in New Hampshire. That's one of five states Mr. Obama will visit in a schedule that has him traveling till well past midnight. The pace can be exhausting - the president's voice is getting hoarse - but political adviser David Axelrod says Mr. Obama is finding new energy on the campaign trail. DAVID AXELROD: I've never seen him more exhilarated than he is right now. He believes in what he's doing. And when he looks out at those crowds, he sees the people who he's fighting for. HORSLEY: Mr. Obama tells supporters he hopes they have some fight left, too, for the last three days of the president's last campaign. Scott Horsley, NPR News, traveling with the president.

            "article_content": "Reminderville is a small Ohio town between Akron and Cleveland that's just about at the center of the American political map this season, when both Republicans and Democrats see Ohio as essential to winning the presidency. Host Scott Simon talks with voters.  SCOTT SIMON, HOST: It's already starting to rain over northern Ohio this past weekend as the outer whirls of Hurricane Sandy approached. Just a few days before the election, people in Reminderville, the village of about 3,000, were concerned about turnout. UNIDENTIFIED CHILD: Trick or treat. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: Trick or treat. UNIDENTIFIED CHILD: Hey, what's going on? UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: Hi. SIMON: ...in the village Halloween party. People in Ohio usually aren't deterred by sleet and wind, so a couple of hundred parents and children turned out under tents for pizza and candy. The chief of police read out the names of the costume winners. JEFF BUCK: For girls, I need the bride of Frankenstein, a wicked Bo Peep. For boys, I need the boy in a box, I need the claw. SIMON: Reminderville is a small village between Akron and Cleveland that's just about at the center of the American political map this season, when both Republicans and Democrats see Ohio as essential to winning the presidency. Reminderville is middle class, mostly white. The recession that staggered Ohio and the rest of the country has gotten a little better here. But some people have lost good jobs, mostly in manufacturing. Many have had to find low-paying part-time work to pay their bills while hoping for better new jobs to open up. Earlier this week, we sat down with a group of five voters in Reminderville's small, bright municipal hall. There was Caitlen Silversten who's 31. You were expecting another Ohio voter momentarily. CAITLEN SILVERSTEN: I am. Yes, I'm a mother of almost three. I have two boys, 4 and 2, and then this is a little girl, and I'm a stay-at-home mom. SIMON: Her husband Mark is the same age and in IT sales. He also owns a bar on Cleveland's west side, which had no electricity this night. He worried about losing a night's receipts. What's the name of the bar in Cleveland? MARK SILVERSTEN: It's called Time Out Bar. SIMON: There was also a retired couple. AL WILLIAMS: I'm Al Williams, a retired school teacher from Mentor, Ohio. Mary and I've been married 20 years and have lived in Reminderville for 19. SIMON: His wife, Mary Williams, worked for a factory that made small rubber parts for cars and washing machines. MARY WILLIAMS: We have eight grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren. SIMON: A stocky, friendly-faced man in his mid 30s completed our group. Terry Bowlin is single, drives almost 50 miles several days a week to two clerical jobs. He doesn't have a lot of time for politics. TERRY BOWLIN: I drive an hour to and from work. SIMON: What time do you leave the house? BOWLIN: A quarter till 7:00 in the morning and I generally get home about 10 o'clock at night. SIMON: Well, what's it like to be the center of attention for these past few weeks? Silverstens? SILVERSTEN: Well, I think there's pros and cons to it. I think - how I look at it is, I mean, our vote really, really, really matters, you know. Some other states, you might cast a vote and I obviously advocate going out and voting, but, you know, sometimes people might take that vote for granted. But here, you truly feel that your vote really matters. So... SIMON: Al Williams says all those millions could have been better spent. WILLIAMS: I think that it might have been better if they'd have donated the money toward the debt that we're in, paid it down and just told the honest facts one or two times, maybe the last two weeks before the election and let that been it. I also think maybe Congress needs to resign and donate their salaries for the next two months to bring the debt down because I don't think they're doing their job right now, either. SIMON: Terry Bowlin is single, but says he needs two jobs just to keep pace with his debts. BOWLIN: It hasn't been going great for me. I'm keeping the second job because I have $50,000 worth of school loans that I now have to pay back. And it's kind of scary. SIMON: Caitlen Silversten says she might have liked to continue working, but it wasn't practical economically. CAITLEN SILVERSTEN: If I would put my kids - or our kids, sorry - in daycare now, my whole paycheck would go to that, and I'd rather be there. SIMON: Stay home. SILVERSTEN: You know, and it's hard, you know, with the economy to get ahead. SIMON: Does the economy win your vote? Is that the most important issue? Almost everybody is nodding their head. Terry Bowlin? BOWLIN: For me, definitely, yes, that's the most pressing issue in my life right now so I mean, it has to be pretty much the deciding factor for me. SIMON: Have you heard an idea that makes you sit up and say, boy, I like that, I'm going to vote for that guy... BOWLIN: No. SIMON: ...'cause of that. BOWLIN: No. SIMON: Yeah. What would improve the economy? What would pick it up now, do you think? SILVERSTEN: Oh, gosh, it's hard to say 'cause we're in so much debt, it's hard to just say what - how to pick it up. SIMON: Caitlen and Mark Silversten. SILVERSTEN: I would say that I think is a good idea is the corporate tax rate. I think we need to be more competitive around the world as far as our tax structure for corporations. SIMON: Let me turn to Al and Mary Williams. Have you heard an economic idea that makes you sit up and say, gee, I like that. WILLIAMS: Not necessarily. But we can't put all the blame on just the last four years. I'm sorry. The economy was sliding way before that and I know it hasn't gotten better. I'd like to see personally a flat tax for everybody. I think that would be the most fair. SIMON: Terry Bowlin? BOWLIN: What I've always wondered is why instead of just pouring money into social programming, why not take that money and give it to small businesses to supplement their payroll so that you can employ these people that claim that they can't find jobs. SIMON: Al and Mary Williams say these last few weeks of clambering ads and candidates touching down daily in Ohio are lost on them. They've already cast their votes. Mark and Caitlin Silversten said they haven't. But they have made up their mind. SILVERSTEN: What I looked at is there's been four years of President Obama that we have to look at. And, you know, he promised a lot of things - cutting the deficit in half, keeping the unemployment rate under 8 percent. And it's been over 8 percent pretty much the entire time of his presidency. I guess I want to try something new. I want someone who's had much private sector experience. SIMON: Al and Mary Williams, you told us that you have voted. So what decided your vote? WILLIAMS: What decided our vote was because all the name calling, all the blame, when you can't blame one person. Yes, he's president of the United States. There's certain thing he can do because he says so, but there's other things he cannot do on his own. WILLIAMS: I also feel strongly that Congress has the greater role in the fact that the country is where it is today. SIMON: Yes, Mark wants to say something. SILVERSTEN: Yeah, I just wanted to say to their point. If my memory serves me correctly, President Obama had two years with complete Democrat Senate and House of Representatives. And he chose to focus on health care, which is an extremely important issue to everybody. But I think he wasted a year and a half plus spent on instead of focusing like a laser beam on the economy, he focused on health care. SIMON: (Unintelligible) WILLIAMS: The only part of the health care thing - we've talked about rising premiums? We've both experienced ours going down this year. SIMON: Everyone in our group of citizens said they know Afghanistan, education and Iran are important issues, and that many feel strongly about abortion and abortion rights. In Ohio, where harsh weather is often expected, no one mentioned global warming. No one said they thought China had robbed jobs from Ohio. No one mentioned President Obama's race or Mitt Romney's religion or cited a single moment or impression from the presidential debates. They knew about many issues, but felt no issue right now is more critical, personal or important than the economy. Terry Bowlin... BOWLIN: This debate is obviously the reason why I'm still undecided. Because I see both sides and I think both opinions are valid. And I'll say that I voted for President Obama four years ago. He hasn't impressed me enough to say a week from the election that I'm definitely going to vote for him. So at this point I'm still up in the air. SIMON: Terry, you're the most important man maybe in the country now. BOWLIN: I say that to myself almost every day. (LAUGHTER) SIMON: So as our Reminderville voters approach Election Day, you could score two early votes for President Obama, two probables for Mitt Romney and one still undecided. We asked the group to pose for a picture. Terry Bowlin stood in the middle. The Silverstens pulled on one arm and the Williams on the other. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: We've got him on this side. Hurry it up. I can't hold him much longer. (LAUGHTER) SIMON: A 35-year-old man with two jobs, a large debt and anxiety about the future: an undecided Ohio voter who, with a lot of other Ohioans, may hold history in his hands.

STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: President Obama is on the road, too, after spending time to focus on helping the Northeast recover from the massive storm called Sandy. A politician at the center of that storm is now backing the president. New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has endorsed the president for reelection, saying he has the values and the vision to guide the country into the future, even though Bloomberg added he was disappointed with the past four years under President Obama. The president holds three campaign rallies today in the crucial battleground state of Ohio. NPR's Scott Horsley reports. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Mayor Bloomberg says Hurricane Sandy, the second big storm to strike New York City in just over a year, has brought the stakes of Tuesday's election into sharp relief. He praised Mr. Obama for taking major steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to climate change. And he criticized Mitt Romney for abandoning the very cap-and-trade program that Romney once championed as Massachusetts' governor. The president said in a statement, he's honored by Bloomberg's endorsement, and he promised the federal government will stand by New York as it recovers from this week's storm. In between campaign rallies yesterday, Mr. Obama was on the phone with leaders from throughout the Northeast, discussing hurricane relief. (SOUNDBITE OF PHONE CALL) PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: We've got military transport getting equipment in to get the power back on. We've got food and water and medical supplies that we're shipping in. And we're not going to stop. Because what we understand is that this could happen to any of us. HORSLEY: There are no Democrats or Republicans during a storm, Mr. Obama said, just fellow Americans. Even as he endorsed the president, Bloomberg complained that Mr. Obama spent too little time and effort in his first term building and sustaining a centrist coalition. He said the president needs to listen to people on both sides of the aisle to build the trust of moderates. Mr. Obama seemed willing, as he campaigned yesterday. We don't need a big government agenda or a small government agenda, he said. We need a middle class agenda. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) OBAMA: We need a vision that says we don't just look out for ourselves. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: That's right. OBAMA: We look out for one another. We look out for future generations. We meet those obligations, working together. That's the change we believe in. And that's what this election is all about. HORSLEY: Bloomberg said he might have supported the moderate version of Romney who ran for the Senate in 1994 or governor in 2003. But since then, he complained, Romney has reversed course on numerous issues, including immigration, gun control, and health care. Mr. Obama mocked his Republican rival yesterday for trying to co-opt the mantle of change. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) OBAMA: Leaving millions without health insurance isn't change. UNIDENTIFIED GROUP: No. OBAMA: Another $5 trillion tax cut that favors the wealthy isn't change. UNIDENTIFIED GROUP: No. OBAMA: Turning Medicare into a voucher is change, but we don't want that change. HORSLEY: As the campaign enters its final weekend, Mr. Obama is pointing to progress made by the U.S. economy on his watch. Rising consumer confidence suggests many people agree. With unemployment persistently high, though, campaign spokeswoman Jen Psaki says Mr. Obama is not letting up. JEN PSAKI: As he says every day, until everybody who wants a job has a job, his job is not done. HORSLEY: Congressional Republicans continue to block many of the president's economic proposals. Mr. Obama complains the GOP has adopted a cynical strategy of fostering gridlock in hopes of winning back the White House. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) OBAMA: And what they're counting on now, is that the American people will be so worn down by all the squabbling in Washington, so tired of all the dysfunction, that you'll actually reward their obstruction and put people back in charge who advocate the very same policies that got us into this mess. HORSLEY: Mr. Obama says he's willing to compromise with politicians from either party. But he told supporters he won't back down on priorities - such as student aid or Medicare - in order to give more tax breaks to the wealthiest Americans. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) OBAMA: That's not bipartisanship. That's not real change. That's surrender to the same status quo that's hurt middle class families for way too long. And I'm not ready to give up on the fight just yet. HORSLEY: Mr. Obama will be waging that fight in earnest this weekend, even as he tries to leave room for grand bargains - on tax policy, deficit reduction, on immigration reform - if he's successful in winning a second term.

            "article_content": "After being grounded for three days by superstorm Sandy, President Barack Obama was back on the campaign trail Thursday.  ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: With his city picking up the pieces left by Sandy, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg used the spotlight today to make a high-profile endorsement. President Obama gets his vote for a second term. Bloomberg singled out the president's leadership on climate change. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: Mr. Obama, meanwhile, resumed campaigning. He's holding rallies today in Wisconsin, Nevada and Colorado while his opponent, Mitt Romney, spends the day in Virginia. SIEGEL: With a handful of days before the election, both candidates are stressing their willingness to work across party lines. As NPR's Scott Horsley reports, Bloomberg's endorsement certainly helps Mr. Obama's bipartisan credentials. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Hello, Wisconsin. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: President Obama had all the trappings of commander in chief this morning as he stepped off Air Force One wearing a leather flight jacket. He'd just gotten off the telephone with governors who are wrestling with storm damage. He told the crowd of more than 2,000 in Green Bay that while Americans have been awed by the destructive power of Hurricane Sandy, they've also been inspired by the way the country has responded. OBAMA: There are no Democrats or Republicans during a storm. There are just fellow Americans. HORSLEY: That idea that we're all in this together, whatever our party, has been a central feature of the Obama brand ever since he burst on the national scene eight years ago. It was reinforced by Mayor Bloomberg's endorsement today, by kind words from New Jersey Governor Chris Christie yesterday, and it's amplified again in a new campaign ad in which former Secretary of State Colin Powell, who served in Republican administrations, renews his endorsement of Mr. Obama. (SOUNDBITE OF CAMPAIGN AD) COLIN POWELL: When he took over, we were in one of the worst recessions we had seen in recent times, close to the Depression. And I saw over the next several years, stabilization come back in the financial community. Housing is starting to pick up. The president saved the auto industry. HORSLEY: Chrysler just reported its best October sales in five years. Consumer confidence hit a four-year high today. And tomorrow's jobs report is expected to show another month of slow but steady private sector growth. Mr. Obama told supporters in Wisconsin the economy is on the mend, though he acknowledge there's unfinished business, saying that's why he wants a second term. OBAMA: Our fight goes on because we know this nation cannot succeed without a growing, thriving middle class and strong, sturdy ladders into the middle class. HORSLEY: The president accused GOP rival Mitt Romney of using all his talents as a salesman to repackage standard Republican orthodoxy of tax cuts and reduced regulation as positive change. While Mr. Obama promised to compromise with politicians of any stripe who support what he calls a common sense agenda, he vowed not to back down in his battles with lawmakers for whom he says obstruction is a strategy aimed at returning to power. OBAMA: In other words, their bet is on cynicism. But, Wisconsin, my bet is on you. (APPLAUSE) OBAMA: My bet is on the decency and good sense of the American people because despite all the resistance, despite all the setbacks, we've won some great fights. And I've never lost sight of the vision we share. HORSLEY: This, then, is Mr. Obama's closing argument heading into the final week of his often bitter campaign: an effort to reconnect with the inspirational and inclusive message that he ran on four years ago, while giving no quarter in the hard-nosed partisan fight for 2012.

Sherrod Brown (right), D-Ohio, debates his Republican challenger, Ohio state Treasurer Josh Mandel, at the City Club in Cleveland on Oct. 15.\n                \n                    \n                    Tony Dejak/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown (right), D-Ohio, debates his Republican challenger, Ohio state Treasurer Josh Mandel, at the City Club in Cleveland on Oct. 15. Most of the attention heading into Election Day may be on the presidential race, but the stakes are also high in the battle for the U.S. Senate, where there are close contests in about a dozen states. According to an NPR analysis of Kantar Media CMAG data, outside groups are spending more than $100 million blanketing the airwaves. This won't come as a surprise if you live in a state with a competitive Senate race. Take Ohio, the Senate race with the most TV ad spending. As of last Saturday, broadcast stations had aired more than 64,000 ads, but the majority didn't come from the candidates or the parties \u2014 they came from outside groups. Conservative groups such as Crossroads GPS and the Club for Growth have both run ads criticizing Sen. Sherrod Brown, the Democratic incumbent. The National Education Association's PAC, the NEA Fund, has aired ads attacking the Republican candidate, Josh Mandel. According to the Kantar data, groups supporting Mandel have run four times more ads than those backing Brown. \"We are being significantly outspent,\" says Guy Cecil, executive director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. \"What we've seen really over the last year is an unprecedented amount of money, largely being spent by a dozen billionaires from around the country who are willing to spend just about anything in order to win.\" In reality, it's hard to know where the money is coming from. On the Republican side in Ohio, more than 95 percent of the independent TV ad spending has come from groups not required to disclose the identities of their donors. This includes Crossroads GPS, the biggest spender in Ohio and in Senate contests nationwide. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is a not-so-distant second. \"We're up there. That's good. I'd be disappointed if we weren't,\" says Scott Reed, the chamber's senior political strategist. As of last Saturday, the chamber had spent more than $5 million on TV ads in Ohio alone, one of 15 Senate races where its ads were on the air. Reed describes the chamber's efforts this election year as \"the largest, most aggressive voter-education campaign in our 100-year history.\" He says the reason so much of this spending is coming from groups with secret donors is free speech. \"The chamber is a 501(c)(6) organization that operates legally,\" Reed says. \"We do not have to disclose our donors.\" Many argue the Ohio Senate race wouldn't even be competitive without all of the outside spending to boost the Republican challenger. On the airwaves, Mandel, Ohio's treasurer, spent only a third of the $18 million spent by these independent groups. David Keating, president of the Center for Competitive Politics and the father of the superPAC, isn't convinced. \"The fact that a race may be competitive when it wasn't expected to be? I think we should be celebrating that,\" Keating says. When it comes to TV spending by outside groups, the split has been far from even. Republican candidates have benefited more than twice as much as their Democratic counterparts. In a majority of those races, like in Ohio, the Republican candidate's campaign was actually outspent by outside groups. In Virginia, former Sen. George Allen has spent less than $3 million on TV, while the outside groups supporting him spent more than $14 million. In contrast, just two of the 10 Democratic candidates were outspent on TV by outside groups that backed them. And an even starker partisan divide? More than 80 percent of all the Republican outside money comes from secret donors. On the Democratic side, less than 10 percent of the money is secret. But money isn't everything. Many political forecasters say they expect Democrats will maintain control of the Senate, something that a year ago seemed nearly impossible. Cook Political Report's Jennifer Duffy says Republicans were hurt by a surprise retirement and controversial comments on rape by Senate candidates Todd Akin of Missouri and Richard Mourdock of Indiana. \"There is not a thing that millions of dollars of outside group advertising could have done to change those situations,\" Duffy says. Still, every one of these groups would most likely say, it was worth the effort and the money no matter the outcome.",

            "article_content": "The next time President Obama and Mitt Romney hit the campaign trail, they will deliver stump speeches to crowds of supporters who don't often give the messages a lot of scrutiny. In the first of two stories, NPR shows the speeches to people who would give them a more critical look: political operatives from the opposite party. First up: President Obama.  RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: During this disaster, President Obama and Governor Romney paused their campaigns, but there's still plenty of time before Election Day for another round of stump speeches - those partisan speeches for partisan crowds who don't give them a lot of scrutiny. So we decided to show the speeches to people who would be more critical - political operatives from the opposite party. In this first of two parts, NPR's Tamara Keith brings us a look at a recent stump speech from President Obama. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: I am fired up right now. (SOUNDBITE OF APPLAUSE) OBAMA: It is good to be in Florida. TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: This was delivered in Delray Beach and it's typical of the president's recent stump speeches. OBAMA: It's not just a choice between two candidates or two parties. It is a choice between two very different visions for this country that we love. (SOUNDBITE OF CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) KEITH: The speech is up on a big screen in a conference room at Hamilton Place Strategies where Tony Fratto is a partner. Fratto used to work in the George W. Bush White House. He pauses the video when the president starts talking about the economy. (SOUNDBITE OF CHEERS) OBAMA: So for over the last fours we've been making real progress, fighting our way back from these policies that failed America. Our businesses have now added more than five million new jobs over the past two and a half years. (APPLAUSE) TONY FRATTO: Everyone is going to be selective in their choice of data points. KEITH: Fratto says the president is doing the same thing he and others in the Bush administration tried, painting the best possible picture of the labor market.  Mr. Obama is only talking about the private sector because the public sector shed half a million jobs during his term. FRATTO: They only talk about job creation. They don't talk about net job growth over the course of the administration, which they've only I think, barely gotten back to even. OBAMA: I've laid out a plan for jobs and middle class security. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Yes, man. OBAMA: And unlike Mitt Romney, I'm actually proud to talk about what's in it. (SOUNDBITE OF APPLAUSE) FRATTO: Now, hold on. KEITH: Fratto pauses the video again. The president is holding up a blue booklet his campaign started distributing last week. Fratto points out that Mitt Romney has a plan too - a 59-point plan he was finally able to condense to five, that he recites whenever he gets a chance. FRATTO: This is a 16-page glossy brochure. Compared to Mitt Romney's 59, 59-point plan, a glossy brochure is - I don't think it stacks up. KEITH: As part of his plan, the president says he will cut the deficit by $4 trillion. OBAMA: We're going to do it in a balanced way, by cutting spending we don't need, but by also asking the wealthiest Americans to pay a little bit more... (SOUNDBITE OF CHEERS) OBAMA: ...so we can invest in research, invest in technology, those things that keep new jobs and businesses coming to America. FRATTO: They're like all worthy things, right? Education, research - all good things. But if you just listen to this formulation again: cut the deficit, pay taxes, but then we're going to spend it. So that's not cutting the deficit. KEITH: Fratto isn't convinced the math adds up. Then the speech moves on to talk about defense. The president points out that Romney didn't mention the war in Afghanistan in his convention speech and didn't talk about the nation's veterans in the debate focused on national security. OBAMA: He didn't say a word about them. Now, he may write off half the country as victims behind closed doors. But the men and women and their families who have served this country so bravely, they deserve better from somebody who is applying to be commander in chief. (SOUNDBITE OF APPLAUSE) FRATTO: It's a real cheap shot. KEITH: Again, Republican strategist, Tony Fratto. FRATTO: The president should know better because he had to deal with those kinds of attacks when he was running for president back in 2008. KEITH: That gets to Fratto's largest complaint with the president's stump speech. It isn't about the facts, as much as it is the tone. Fratto says he wonders what happened to the president who in his inaugural address talked about putting aside petty partisan differences. This afternoon on ALL THINGS CONSIDERED, we'll watch a Romney stump speech with a Democratic strategist. Tamara Keith, NPR News, Washington.

As the presidential campaign has unfolded, the candidates have traded polemics about wealth, class warfare, taxes, dependency and the role of government. And while it may be uncomfortable to admit, some Americans are simply more financially successful than others. But why do some achieve wealth, while others struggle? Why does one woman make it to the executive suite, while another man drives a taxi? And what do we think explains our prosperity \u2014 or lack thereof? All Things Considered host Robert Siegel visited North Carolina's Research Triangle area, to ask people from very different walks of life how they account for their economic station in life. In the second of a three-part series, several middle-class Americans, with incomes solidly in the mid-five figures, describe why they feel they've landed on the middle of the nation's economic ladder. In Carrboro, N.C., just outside Chapel Hill, a group of 20-somethings are sitting around a table. They met at the University of North Carolina. One of them, Sarah Bidgood, came here for a master's degree in Russian studies. She was a Russian language and literature major at Wellesley College. Sarah Bidgood is managing editor of the Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography. She says her parents helped her start adult life with no debt, giving her a leg up.\n                \n                    \n                    Art Silverman/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Sarah Bidgood is managing editor of the Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography. She says her parents helped her start adult life with no debt, giving her a leg up. Life agreed with Bidgood in this prosperous patch of North Carolina, ringed by universities and high-tech businesses. After earning her master's degree, she got a good job that bears almost no relationship to her education: managing editor of the Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography. At 25, Bidgood is self-supporting. When asked what factors contribute to her sense of success, she tells All Things Considered host Robert Siegel that she is indebted to a family that ensured she entered adult life debt-free. \"My parents were fortunate enough to do the majority of their adult work in a really prosperous economy, so I actually don't have any debts, which is part of the reason why I'm able to have only one job and a job that doesn't pay me $150,000 a year \u2014 I'm not paying anything off,\" she says. Her parents also pushed her to pursue the things she was most interested in as opposed to things that would be most lucrative, she says. And while she has worked hard, she also credits her intelligence for her success. \"I think as much as anything having good social savvy and having good sort of social brains has helped me just as much as having book smarts,\" she says. Bidgood also says it helped having two parents with doctoral degrees who were knowledgeable about academic journals and the kind of work she ultimately found. \"I know the economy is terrible, but I've been lucky to have great opportunities.\" Corporate Refugees If Bidgood is on the economy's \"up escalator,\" she's passing the Zepps, who are happily on the way down. Donald Zepp, 67, and his wife, Carmen \u2014 26 years his junior \u2014 have a 4-year-old son together. Both have been married before and both were well-employed before. Donald taught at Cornell and worked for the multinational agrichemical company Rhone-Poulenc until he was downsized. Carmen worked in the finance department of the pharmaceutical firm GlaxoSmithKline but quit after surviving ovarian cancer. \"It was eight years before I joined the legion of people who on getting out of corporate America say, 'That was the best that ever happened to me,' \" Donald says. \"It took eight years, but I did reach that point where one day I said, 'You know, I'm really happy, this beats the hell out of working.' \" The Zepps live in Wendell, N.C., 20 miles east of Raleigh, where they bought the local music store. Together, they've gone into business selling banjos. Donald says he loves them so much that he was tossed out of college once for his lack of interest in anything else. \"The banjo was a sort of a sidetrack because when I really learned to play, I was playing about eight hours a day and that's when I was a freshman in college and I was supposed to be going to classes and things like that, so I got flung out of college for playing banjo all the time,\" he says. \"The good part was I put myself back through school, by teaching and playing banjo.\" The Zepps cheerfully describe their economic situation as \"dismal\" and say they get by, for the most part, on his pension and Social Security. Carmen says the path to their present economic station reflects a variety of factors \u2014 including help from the federal government. When Phil Luby was laid off in late 2008, he decided to become an entrepreneur and open a used car lot.\n                \n                    \n                    Alex Cardinell/Courtesy of Phil Luby\n                    \n                \nhide caption When Phil Luby was laid off in late 2008, he decided to become an entrepreneur and open a used car lot. \"There are many factors obviously, but when I was first married my husband was an airman, we qualified for food stamps and nutrition programs for young children, so government has certainly played a role,\" she says, adding that there is no one factor that has gotten her to where she is today economically. The Drive To Succeed Phil Luby is another refugee from corporate life who struck out on his own. He says he used to make $200,000 a year marketing pharmaceuticals. When he was downsized in 2008, he rolled the dice on the used car business. It was a tough business to get into then, but he says things are improving. Luby, 51, points to his upbringing as a key to his resilience. \"The way I was brought up, my background, my faith, and the belief that tomorrow is another day just kept me going,\" he says. \"I'd say that brains are pretty important, but it's not everything.\" The Ohio native wasn't able to identify any federal government programs he had gotten any assistance from, but Luby did talk about one that he says hurt his used car business: Cash for Clunkers. \"Just look at over a million cars being taken out of our circulation. Everybody on our side of the fence suffered \u2014 the car recyclers, the used car business, used car parts went up,\" he says. \"What's happened is the prices have been elevated ever since, but we've never recovered from that.\" Luby's income these days is in the mid-five figures. Faith And Finance That's also true of the Dingles \u2014 Lee, 31, his wife, Shannon, 30, and their three small children. Lee is a structural engineer; he says he makes a little more than $60,000 a year. Shannon is staying at home with the kids, including 11-month-old daughter Zoe, who has cerebral palsy and was adopted from Taiwan. Shannon conceded that hard work comes into play, but she also recalled her time in the public school teaching program Teach for America, after she graduated from the University of North Carolina. Shannon and Lee Dingle say help from family and their strong faith have helped them stay on financially sound ground.\n                \n                    \n                    Art Silverman/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Shannon and Lee Dingle say help from family and their strong faith have helped them stay on financially sound ground. \"When I lived in South Texas, I lived in the county that, at that time, was the poorest county in the United States. I knew lots of people who worked really hard and who were not comfortable or content with their economic situation,\" Shannon says. Lee and Shannon both have supportive parents who pushed them to be educated and helped with a down payment on their first house. But most important is their Baptist faith. Lee says they try to make all of their decisions through Christianity, though many times they fall short. \"Our faith is very important to us and we do believe that God is sovereign over finances, economic state, all of those things,\" Shannon says. \"We can't fully explain \u2014 because he's God and we're not \u2014 how that plays out in terms of why we're so comfortable whereas we have friends and loved ones who aren't.\"",

What would President Obama do with a second term? It's been a bit of a mystery throughout the campaign. The president seems to devote at least as much time criticizing his Republican opponent Mitt Romney as he does explaining what he'd like to do if returned to office. Obama has taken some heat for his silence and sought to answer such complaints this week. But even as he's made his priorities more clear, he hasn't answered what may be the biggest outstanding question: how he'll get congressional Republicans to go along with his agenda. On Tuesday, Obama's campaign released a 20-page, photo-heavy booklet that it intends to mail to 3.5 million households in swing states. The overall themes in \"The New Economic Patriotism: A Plan for Jobs & Middle-Class Security\" have also been emphasized in ads and speeches this week. It's pretty simple. He wants to improve education, manufacturing and energy production; raise taxes on the wealthy to help reduce the deficit; and end the war in Afghanistan. In short, his second-term agenda sounds a lot like his first-term agenda. Whether that's a good thing or a bad thing depends on how you feel about his presidency at this point. Republicans, naturally, argue that a second Obama term would be a failure. A mantra of the Romney campaign has been that the country can't afford four more years like the past four. Kevin Madden, a senior adviser to the Romney campaign, dismissed Obama's new booklet as a \"glossy panic button.\" Some Democrats say they'd be happy with a second term that builds on and consolidates the achievements of Obama's first term. Paul Glastris, editor in chief of The Washington Monthly, says the president would have to concentrate during a second term on finalizing matters such as banking regulation, as well as \"getting Obamacare to work right.\" \"This guy did so much in his first term that still needs to be regulated out and adjudicated,\" says Glastris, a former senior speechwriter for President Bill Clinton. \"If all he does in the next four years is dealing with what he did in the first four, that will be a hell of a good eight years.\" The importance of the Affordable Care Act is indeed highlighted in Obama's booklet, as are what might be described as defensive positions on entitlements, with promises to defend Social Security and Medicare against Republican initiatives such as privatization and vouchers. In an interview with The Des Moines Register that was originally conducted off the record, Obama suggested congressional Republicans will be forced to compromise with him because of the so-called fiscal cliff \u2014 a combination of automatic spending cuts and expiring tax cuts that could harm the economy if Washington fails to act before the end of the year. Because legislation is needed to head off this scenario, Obama's veto power could leave him with a strong hand, as some liberal commentators have implied. But Republicans, who are expected at least to retain control of the House regardless of who wins the presidency, may feel no more warmly toward Obama's agenda than they have for the past four years. (Democrats may keep control of the Senate, but short of 60 votes it's difficult for any party to promote its agenda there.) \"The real obstacle will be the House, and there he'll have to be exceedingly aggressive,\" says Thomas Mann, a congressional scholar at the Brookings Institution who has written critically of contemporary Republicans. He believes the perils of the fiscal cliff give Obama a \"reasonable chance\" of extracting a deal from congressional Republicans, who aren't in favor of raising taxes on top earners, as Obama favors. \"They won't drop their objections,\" Mann says. \"The question is whether circumstances will lead them to find a different baseline.\" The president has been hopeful that the fact of his re-election would make congressional Republicans more amenable to compromise on budget and tax issues, but his recent restatement of principles in those areas has done nothing, as yet, to bring them around. Much depends, obviously, on how the election plays out. \"I expect you'll have to see all sorts of compromises from both sides of the aisle,\" says presidential historian Robert Dallek. \"But it depends on what Obama might win by. If he loses the popular vote and squeaks through with the electoral vote, that makes things more uncertain.\" One issue that isn't mentioned in Obama's booklet but could get considerable attention during a second term is immigration. \"It's been pretty clear to us that he's going to make immigration reform a priority in his second term,\" says Frank Sharry, executive director of America's Voice, which takes a liberal position on immigration. Sharry says Obama will owe his victory in no small measure to Hispanic voters, who will want to see action on immigration issues. The question, he says, is whether Republicans will view Obama's victory \u2014 which would likely be based on demographic trends that could handicap the GOP in the future \u2014 as a prod to greater cooperation. The president himself expressed optimism on this score in the Des Moines Register interview. \"Should I win a second term,\" Obama said, \"a big reason I will win a second term is because the Republican nominee and the Republican Party have so alienated the fastest-growing demographic group in the country, the Latino community.\"",

            "article_content": "About 34 million taxpayers take the mortgage interest deduction, for a typical savings of approximately $600 a year.\n                \n                    \n                    iStockphoto.com\n                    \n                \nhide caption About 34 million taxpayers take the mortgage interest deduction, for a typical savings of approximately $600 a year. In coming months, Congress will begin an epic struggle to get the federal budget deficit under control. One tax break almost certain to come into play is the mortgage interest deduction. Both President Obama and his Republican rival, Mitt Romney, have suggested ways to scale back the deduction's value for wealthy taxpayers. And many economists are cheering them on, saying that now \u2014 when interest rates are low \u2014 would be a great time to reduce or even phase out the deduction. \"If we are going to have a serious effort at reform, this will have to be considered,\" said Mark Luscombe, principle federal tax analyst with CCH Group, a tax services and software firm. But no matter how much candidates and economists may want to push for changes to the mortgage interest deduction, many members of Congress will remain wary. Think about it: Not every congressman has a steel mill in his district, or a wheat farm or shipyard. But every district has a Realtor and someone who builds homes and a banker who wants to lend money. \"This deduction has been with us for a very long time, and the [real estate] industry lobbies heavily for it,\" Luscombe said. For a century, Congress has been allowing taxpayers to lower their annual federal tax bills by deducting the cost of the interest payments made on mortgages. 'They All Take The Deduction' The congressional Joint Committee on Taxation estimates about 34 million taxpayers take the deduction. Most people save roughly $600 annually by doing so. For many, that's the only big tax break they can get, and they love it. A Gallup poll last year found that 6 in 10 Americans oppose eliminating the deduction to help solve the budget deficit problem. \"Most everyone who buys a home gets a mortgage,\" Luscombe said. And among those who pay taxes and qualify, \"they all take the deduction,\" he added. People in the housing industry love it too. Realtors, mortgage brokers, homebuilders and other say that the deduction encourages people to buy, rather than rent. They say Congress must continue to provide the tax break to help the battered housing sector. \"The housing market is far too fragile to sustain any tax increases,\" Ron Phipps, 2011 president of the National Association of Realtors, told Congress in a letter last year. Even considering a phase-out of the tax break \"would send the wrong signal,\" he said. A Pricey Perk But the deduction, which can be taken on up to two homes, is a pricey perk for homeowners at a time when the federal budget deficit is enormous. The deduction shrinks government coffers by about $83 billion a year, according to Congress' taxation committee. Supporters say that's a small price for government to pay to encourage Americans to own property. A home is the single largest investment most people will ever make, and broad-based ownership helps build a large middle class of property owners, according to the Realtors' association. A strong housing market offers \"long-term social and financial benefits to individual homeowners,\" the Realtors said in a research paper. Areas where people own homes have better educational outcomes, more civic participation, lower crime and other benefits, the trade group says. But critics say the Treasury can't afford the deduction, and in any case, it's bad public policy because it encourages people to take on too much debt, discriminates against renters and favors people with upper incomes. Driving Up Housing Costs? Conservative Joseph Farah, author of The Tea Party Manifesto, recently wrote in a column: \"It makes perfect economic sense to get rid of the mortgage-interest deduction. It seems like a benefit to homeowners carrying mortgages, but it actually is one of many factors driving up the cost of housing, the scarcity of mortgage loans and interest rates.\" Romney is suggesting setting a dollar limit on deductions for each tax filer who itemizes. One number he tossed out in the first presidential debate was $25,000 a year. \"Anybody can have deductions up to that amount,\" he said. In other words, individual taxpayers could decide which deductions they want to take, but only up to the cap. So, some filers might choose to take the mortgage deduction, while others \u2014 say, seniors who rent \u2014 might want to take deductions for charitable giving, municipal bond interest payments, etc. They could have all the deductions that work best for them, up to the limit. Wealthier people, especially those with two homes, would hit the cap quickly, so Romney's proposal would trim the value of the deduction for them. A Campaign Issue Obama is taking a somewhat different approach, saying he would protect the tax break for people in the middle income brackets, but eliminate it for those taxpayers making more than $250,000. \"I refuse to ask middle-class families to give up your deduction for owning a home or raising kids just so we pay for another millionaire's tax cut,\" Obama said on the stump last month while discussing ways to balance the budget. Luscombe, the tax analyst, said he believes Congress probably will try to reduce the value of the deduction in some way \u2014 perhaps setting a cap or limiting it to just one home. Proponents of change have one advantage now: Interest rates are so low that homes are, for the most part, at affordable levels. When the Federal Reserve's policymakers end their two-day meeting Wednesday afternoon, they are expected to announce they'll continue pushing down on mortgage interest rates.",

Drinking and debate-watching often go hand in hand \u2014 to the point where drinking games have been developed around watching the debates. Here's a new idea for a Presidential Debate Drinking Game: Every time someone says \"Presidential Debate Drinking Game\" today, take a drink. Just kidding. But drinking games have become a familiar part of the American political landscape \u2014 like buttons, bunting and bumper stickers. Where there are political rallies, there are protesting groups. Where there are campaign speeches, there are fact checking teams. And where there are presidential candidates' debates, there are drinking games. With the final 2012 presidential tete-a-tete, um, on tap tonight between President Obama and Mitt Romney in Boca Raton, Fla., some Americans are looking forward to the debauchery as well as the debate. You know how a debate drinking game works. It is usually played with a group of people who are watching the event. If a candidate utters a predetermined word or phrase, you take a drink \u2014 usually of the alcoholic variety. Some Internet habitu\u00e9s play the game with others online \u2014 putting the mead in social media. Games On You can find contests tailored to the presidential debates all over the Web. The Cloture Club, a website of Washington goings-on, offers a list of two dozen utterances \u2014 such as \"terrorism\" and \"United Nations\" \u2014 and instructs players to drink each time either candidate speaks the word or phrase tonight. NerdWallet, an investment advisory company, breaks down the challenge by candidate. According to the game rules, \"Take a sip when Obama: Mentions the dwindling middle class.\" Or \"When Romney: Interrupts the moderator.\" Forward, a Jewish-oriented news site, created a drinking game especially for its readers. Debate watchers are instructed to \"Take a sip if you hear: An anecdote about a Jewish lady in Florida/Ohio/Nevada or some other random swing state,\" among other things. And to \"Pound a shot for: 'Choo-tzpah,' or any other butchered Yiddishism.\" \"I suppose if I were in college I, too, might be listening to the diverging opinions on healthcare and homeland security in the same way,\" writes Caren Osten Gerszberg in The Huffington Post. \"In other words: Drink when you hear 'Obamacare'; chug when you hear mention of Al Qaeda; sip continuously if a candidate goes over his allotted response time.\" She points to a College Humor drinking game that asks the question: \"As two men face off in a rhetorical battle of epic proportions to determine the future of our great nation, why not booze it up?\" Hi, Bob Do inventors of drinking games believe that an increase in the intake of alcohol might make some candidates seem more attractive or more coherent? Dan Mueller, creator of Debate Drinking, says, \"Our goal isn't to make the candidates any more interesting to listen to, but rather to encourage people to watch and listen to the debates, and to do so with their friends.\" Mueller, a Web designer in Dayton, Ohio, says, \"We try to stay as nonpartisan and inclusive as possible.\" Therefore, Mueller's game avoids the \" 'drink when the other side lies' type of rules,\" he says. \"We know that people have friends and family with differing political views, and we believe that should not get in the way of sharing a beer and hearing both sides of the debates.\" Words on Mueller's list include: \"nuclear\" and \"jobs\" for Obama, and \"freedom\" and trade\" for Romney. The official rules also offer this suggestion for tonight's encounter: \"If either candidate greets moderator Bob Schieffer with \"Hi Bob,\" EVERYBODY DRINKS!\" A Sad State As with everything else in America these days, there is a debate over Debate Drinking Games. \"Drinking games generally have the goal of encouraging alcohol consumption to levels of intoxication and, commonly, much higher than the legal limit of intoxication,\" says James Garbutt, a psychiatry professor and director of the Alcohol and Substance Abuse Program at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine. Whereas a small amount of alcohol might bring on a pleasant feeling, Garbutt explains, too much alcohol can lead to a sad state \"where judgment and social inhibitions can be impaired, which can lead to bad decisions and actions \u2014 think photos and videos that folks wished were never taken, on up to actions leading to legal problems or risk to health.\" As alcohol levels rise, Garbutt warns, \"the physical effects increase with impairment in visual acuity, reflexes, motor function and balance \u2014 the reasons why we don't want intoxicated individuals driving. Acute high alcohol levels also increase risk for health consequences such as stomach pain and reflux, vomiting with risk of inhaling vomit and pneumonia, and injuries. \" A drinking game, Garbutt adds, \"may be 'fun' in the classic sense of alcohol acting as a social lubricant. But a game that encourages the development of intoxication \u2014 often to well above the legal limit of intoxication \u2014 has few pros. Needless to say, watching a presidential debate while intoxicated is not a good plan for informing oneself about issues that affect our lives.\" Ancient Games Sarah Lohman, on the other hand, thinks that presidential debate drinking games are harmless. Lohman is the creator of the historic gastronomy website Four Pounds Flour. \"If you're playing a drinking game during the debates, that means you're watching it with friends,\" she says. \"You're paying close attention, and you're probably going to talk about what they said afterwards. To me, there's nothing negative about that.\" Drinking games \"are almost as ancient as drinking itself,\" Lohman tells a gathering in Brooklyn recently. (You can listen to Lohman's \"Alcohol and Drinking Games\" podcast here; she begins at the 34:00 mark.) She describes a drinking game played by ancient Greeks that involved flicking wine dregs from one cup into another. She speaks of another centuries-old pastime in China that is an alcohol-laced variation of Rock, Paper, Scissors. And she tells tales of \"toasting games\" that migrated from England to early America. By 1830, Lohman says, referring to a chart, the annual per capita consumption of distilled spirits in the United States was five gallons \u2014 for every man, woman and child. Such widespread imbibing led to a strong temperance movement and eventually Prohibition in the 1920s. America probably needed to dry out for a while, she tells the group. \"We were a ... mess.\" Nowadays, Lohman says in an interview, \"we drink faaaar less alcohol today than in the 1830s. Currently, we drink a little more than two gallons per capita per year.\" But by the looks of all the drinking games, some people drink a little extra \u2014 especially around election time.",

            "article_content": "When our series began yesterday, we brought together five economists from across the political spectrum and had them create a platform for their dream presidential candidate. It's a platform \u2014 Get rid of a tax deduction for homeowners! Raise the price of gas! \u2014 that would sink any real candidate. But we aren't creating a real candidate. We're creating a fake candidate. And to help us, we talked to two veteran political consultants \u2014 Hank Sheinkopf and Kim Alfano. \"You have a radical plan which will bankrupt families,\" Alfano told us. \"You're insane.\" \"I think you should move to another country,\" Sheinkopf said. Canada, maybe? \"Not even Canada,\" he said. \"Some of this won't fly in Canada.\" And after they both finished laughing at the economists' ideas, the consultants agreed to help us create a campaign for our fake candidate. Sheinkopf's first piece of advice: Don't be so brainy. Take, for example, our economists' plan to eliminate the mortgage-interest tax deduction. We shouldn't mention that getting rid of the deduction would cost middle-class homeowners money, Sheinkopf said. Off the top of his head, he sketched out a possible TV ad: \"A bold economic plan to protect America's future,\" he said. \"Get rid of deductions for the rich. ... Tax deduction for homeownership takes millions of dollars away from people in need, reduces services, takes money away from the places we need to spend it. From education. From health care. For our children, for our future ... reform the tax system.\" You'll note the ad doesn't appeal to logic. It doesn't ask people to give up anything valuable. It says: Soak the other guy. Alfano said the ad shouldn't get bogged down in the details. Because once you give specifics, your opponent can use them against you. Sell images, not specifics. \"I see a horse,\" she said. \"I see a song.\" One thing you should never see in any political ad, according to Alfano: an economist. One consultant's vision for our political ad: \"I see a horse.\"\n                \n                    \n                    iStockphoto.com\n                    \n                \nhide caption",

            "article_content": "A group in Wisconsin is trying to heal that state's bitter partisan divide by holding monthly meetings and forums to discuss political issues with in a friendly and more civil way. But could they remain civil while watching Tuesday night's presidential debate?  MELISSA BLOCK, HOST: From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Melissa Block. ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: And I'm Robert Siegel. Last night's second presidential debate produced more friction and fireworks than the first, and that didn't seem to bother a group of voters in a state that knows a lot about political bickering, Wisconsin. NPR's David Schaper watched the debate with roughly a dozen Democrats and Republicans who have dedicated themselves to bridging their state's political divide. DAVID SCHAPER, BYLINE: They are all smiles, this group of both staunch liberals and conservatives, as they greet one another at Mariner's Inn on the outskirts of Madison, Wisconsin. But just like in a high school lunchroom, they sit with their own at tables of right and left as the debate begins. CANDY CROWLEY: Good evening, from Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York. I'm Candy Crowley from CNN's \"State Of The Union.\" SCHAPER: The group is called Reach Out Wisconsin, formed in the wake of the sharp and bitter divide that gaped open in the state after the election of Governor Scott Walker almost two years ago. Their goal is to foster respect and understanding in politics with civil discourse. But that doesn't stop at least a few from snickering at some of the president's answers, such as this explanation of why gas prices were so much lower when he took office. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Because the economy was on the verge of collapse. (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER) UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Still is! SCHAPER: And from the tables on the left, there are audible groans to Mitt Romney's promotion of more drilling for oil and gas. When it's over, Wisconsinites on both sides say this is the best debate yet. SCOTT GRABINS: I do like it when they let the candidates talk to one another. SCHAPER: Scott Grabins is a conservative and co-founder of Reach Out Wisconsin, and he says he enjoys watching the candidates sniping and sparring back and forth. S. GRABINS: Because I think those are some of the most honest spots of the debate because that's unscripted, that's where they're going back and forth and it's rapid fire. You got to think on your feet. And I think that's when what they really think starts to come out. SCHAPER: Grabins gives Mitt Romney high marks for his debate performance, especially on jobs and the economy. But he also thinks President Obama did quite well. His wife, Carol Grabins, says Mr. Obama has trouble with the facts, especially in his response to the attack on the American consulate in Libya. CAROL GRABINS: If you're talking about being truthful, no, I will give him an F for flunking the truth. SCHAPER: For liberal Ron Dolan(ph), it was good to see a presidential comeback. RON DOLAN: You can't just roll over like, you know, Obama did in the first debate. You have to show a little backbone and he did that. And he stuck to his guns. It was a little more spirited, didn't seem completely out of it. SCHAPER: But Dolan says he actually thinks Mitt Romney is the better debater. DOLAN: You know, good for Romney. He does look presidential. But at the same time, when he's telling me he's an advocate for women's rights, renewable energy, the middle class, I mean, he's more of a snake oil salesman. He's selling me something. I don't believe him. SCHAPER: But the left-leaning Dolan says the president was selling him something, too, in trying to defend his jobs record. Conservative Todd Osborne(ph) of Cross Plains, Wisconsin, says he found both candidates to be shading the truth. TODD OSBORNE: They seldom tell a flat-out lie. They tell a part of the story or the part they want you to know and conveniently leave out the rest. SCHAPER: It's a point of agreement with many of the dozen or so here. And while no one will be changing votes after this debate, all say they enjoy hearing from those with opposing views. Susan Kimball(ph) of Spring Green, Wisconsin, who was attending her first Reach Out Wisconsin event, puts it this way. SUSAN KIMBALL: It's nice to hear both sides and people have respect for each other's opinions instead of animosity and anger. SCHAPER: And all agree there is far too little of that in politics today.

            "article_content": "President Obama traveled to Iowa Wednesday morning to meet with voters after Tuesday night's second presidential debate.  ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Robert Siegel. MELISSA BLOCK, HOST: And I'm Melissa Block. President Obama stood today in Iowa, in front of a crowd of enthusiastic college students, and struck a seemingly humble pose about last night's debate. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: You know, I'm still trying to figure out, you know, how to get the hang of this thing, debating. But we're working on it. BLOCK: Humility aside, it was Mr. Obama's turn to celebrate after a far more feisty debate performance than in his first outing against Mitt Romney. The president was under pressure after slipping in the polls over the past two weeks. SIEGEL: Well, today both candidates returned to the routine of swing state rallies and we're going to hear from our correspondents traveling with both of them. First, to NPR's Scott Horsley, who was on the road with the president. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: President Obama recapped some of the highlights of the debate for a crowd of 2,000 in a sweltering college gym this afternoon. Speaking at Cornell College in Mount Vernon, Iowa, Mr. Obama underscored his efforts to help women get equal pay in the workplace, an area where Governor Romney may have stumbled last night. OBAMA: I've got to tell you, we don't have to collect a bunch of binders to find qualified, talented, driven young women ready to learn and teach in these fields right now. HORSLEY: Last night's strong performance was a tonic for the president's supporters like Steven Lucas(ph), a pipefitter who joined others at a union hall in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, to watch the debate. Lucas said he was anxious to see a more aggressive president than he had in Denver two week earlier. STEVEN LUCAS: I didn't want him to be timid. I didn't want him to be too nice. I wanted him to show some gumption. HORSLEY: After 90 minutes, Lucas said the president had met that bar and then some. LUCAS: Absolutely. Tickled pink. And I think that the American public in general will respond to that. He's got his mojo back, so to speak. HORSLEY: This crowd cheered when Mr. Obama mentioned the thousands of wind energy jobs in Iowa, some of which could be in jeopardy without the tax credit Governor Romney opposes. They also cheered when Mr. Obama went after his Republican rival's tax plan, saying as an investor, Romney himself would insist on seeing more details. (SOUNDBITE OF PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE) OBAMA: You wouldn't have taken such a sketchy deal. And neither should you, the American people. (CHEERING) HORSLEY: Finally, someone in the crowd said. These voters are suspicious of Governor Romney's plan that he could offset the cost of his tax cut by closing unspecified tax loopholes without increasing the deficit or costing the middle class more. Mike Olson(ph) is with the electrical workers union. MIKE OLSON: I'm 60 - gonna be 63 years old and I've seen snake oil sold before. And I don't mean to be so harsh on Mr. Romney, but I'm seeing snake oil being sold again. HORSLEY: This is clearly a partisan crowd and it'll take several days before we know how the debate moved undecided voters, if at all. The Iowa backers say the focused, energetic man on stage last night was the Barack Obama they rallied behind four years ago. Linda Langston(ph) was relieved to see Mr. Obama go after what she considers Governor Romney's misstatements. LINDA LANGSTON: I mean, oh, my god, even Candy Crowley had to confront some of them, they were so outrageous. HORSLEY: The CNN moderator weighed in last night on the subject of last month's attack in Libya in which four Americans were killed. Crowley confirmed that Mr. Obama had used the phrase \"act of terror\" the day after the attack, which seemed to surprise Governor Romney. Republicans have pointed to that attack as an indictment of the president's broader foreign policy in the region. But Langston says Mr. Obama managed to turn a potential liability into one of the debates most memorable moments. LANGSTON: He let him know, I am the president and I'm the one that sends these orders. And yes, the buck does stop here and I am the one that meets these coffins when they come home. That, to me, was a completely different tenor and a completely different perspective, in a good way. HORSLEY: The president will now try to build on that strong performance. He has more campaign rallies this week in Ohio, New Hampshire and Virginia before the final debate next week in Florida. Scott Horsley, NPR News, traveling with the president.

            "article_content": "Two weeks ago, GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney was seen as the clear winner of that debate. A very different President Obama showed up for the second debate. He went hard after his Republican opponent from the very start.  RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: This is MORNING EDITION, from NPR News. I'm Renee Montagne. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: And I'm Steve Inskeep. The pundits' reaction to last night's presidential debate was sharply different than the first. MONTAGNE: Andrew Sullivan, a President Obama supporter, pronounced the debate a victory for his candidate. That's a big change from the first meeting, when Sullivan had a virtual meltdown and pronounced the election all but lost. INSKEEP: A more conservative writer, Ramesh Ponnuru of National Review, quipped: Obama stopped the liberal hand-wringing, so that's a victory. Otherwise, he said, it was a draw. Of course, you can't really tell the morning after what effect a debate will really have on the central question: how Americans will vote. That will be decided in the days ahead, as Americans listen again to the arguments and talk them over and have their own debates as the campaigns go on. Let's listen now along with NPR's Don Gonyea. DON GONYEA, BYLINE: After his widely panned performance at the first debate, everyone was watching to see if the president would bring something different last night.  There were also concerns that the format, taking questions from regular citizens, would hobble him, making attacks come off as rude. So with much anticipation, question one came from 20-year-old college student Jeremy Epstein. (SOUNDBITE OF PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE) JEREMY EPSTEIN: All I hear from professors, neighbors and others is that when I graduate, I will have little chance to get employment. Can - what can you say to reassure me, but more importantly my parents, that I will be able to sufficiently support myself after I graduate? GONYEA: Things started politely enough.  Governor Romney, by virtue of a pre-debate coin toss, answered first. (SOUNDBITE OF PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE) MITT ROMNEY: Your question is one that's being asked by college kids all over this country. I was in Pennsylvania with someone who'd just graduated. This was in Philadelphia, and she said: I - I've got my degree. I can't find a job. I've got three part-time jobs. GONYEA: Romney continued... (SOUNDBITE OF PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE) ROMNEY: With half of college kids graduating this year without a college - excuse me, without a job and without a college-level job, that's just unacceptable. And likewise, you've got more and more debt on your back. So more debt and less jobs. I'm going to change that. I know what it takes to create good jobs again. GONYEA: Then it was the president's turn. He, too, started in friendly, conversational tones. (SOUNDBITE OF PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE) PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Jeremy, first of all, your future is bright, and the fact that you're making an investment in higher education is critical. GONYEA: But in the two minutes allotted for responses, he quickly went on the attack. (SOUNDBITE OF PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE) OBAMA: You know, when Governor Romney said we should let Detroit go bankrupt, I said, we're going to bet on American workers and the American auto industry, and it's come surging back. I want to do that in industries, not just in Detroit, but all across the country. GONYEA: The moderator, CNN's Candy Crowley, turned to Romney for rebuttal. (SOUNDBITE OF PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE) ROMNEY: And I know he keeps saying: You wanted to take Detroit bankrupt. Well, the president took Detroit bankrupt. You took General Motors bankrupt. You took Chrysler bankrupt. So when you say that I wanted to take the auto industry bankrupt, you actually did. And - and I think it's important to know that that was a process that was necessary to get those companies back on their feet, so they could start hiring more people. That was precisely what I recommended, and ultimately what happened. GONYEA: Then it was Mr. Obama's turn again. (SOUNDBITE OF PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE) OBAMA: Candy, what Governor Romney said just isn't true. He wanted to take them into bankruptcy without providing them any way to stay open, and we would have lost a million jobs. And that - don't take my word for it. Take the executives at GM and Chrysler, some of whom are Republicans, may even support Governor Romney. But they'll tell you his prescription wasn't going to work. GONYEA: Each had answered the original question. Each had gotten a rebuttal. But as the moderator turned to the next citizen questioner, Romney jumped in, wanting to respond yet again. She cut him off, but it was clearly going to be a bumpy night. The two men argued over energy prices, the high cost of gasoline. The president cited increased global demand. He said domestic oil production is up, and that making more efficient cars will lower people's gas bills by saving fuel. Romney countered with statistics, portraying the president as an obstacle to oil, coal and natural gas production. (SOUNDBITE OF PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE) ROMNEY: I don't think anyone really believes that you're a person who's going to be pushing for oil and gas and coal. You'll get your chance in a moment. I'm still speaking. OBAMA: Well, Governor... ROMNEY: My - and the answer is: I don't believe people think that's the case, because I - I'm... OBAMA: If - if you're asking me a question, I'm going to answer it. ROMNEY: That wasn't a question. OBAMA: OK. All right. ROMNEY: That was a statement. I don't think the American people believe that. GONYEA: On the topic of taxes, Romney again defended his tax plan, which includes across-the-board reductions in tax rates and the elimination of still-unspecified tax write-offs that Romney says would not result in any increase in the deficit or in the taxes paid by the middle class. The president cites independent studies showing the Romney tax plan's math doesn't work. (SOUNDBITE OF PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE) OBAMA: Now, Governor Romney was a very successful investor. If somebody came to you, governor, with a plan that said, here, I want to spend seven or $8 trillion, and then we're going to pay for it, but we can't tell you until maybe after the election how we're going to do it, you wouldn't have taken such a sketchy deal. GONYEA: Candy Crowley asked Romney if he'd look at changes to his proposal once in office if the numbers don't add up. (SOUNDBITE OF PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE) ROMNEY: Of course they add up. I was someone who ran businesses for 25 years and balanced the budget. I ran the Olympics and balanced the budget. I ran the state of Massachusetts as a governor - to the extent any governor does - and balanced the budget all four years. GONYEA: But he did not offer any more specifics on his tax plan. And then there came the topic of Romney's overseas investments. (SOUNDBITE OF PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE) ROMNEY: Any investments I have over the last years have been managed by a blind trust, and I understand they do include investments outside the United States, including in Chinese companies. Mr. President, have you looked your pension? OBAMA: Candy... ROMNEY: Have you looked at your pension? OBAMA: ...I've got to say... ROMNEY: Mr. President, have you looked at your pension? OBAMA: You know, I don't look at my pension. It's not as big as yours, so it doesn't take as long. ROMNEY: Well, let me give you some - let me give you some advice. OBAMA: I don't check it that often. GONYEA: It was the kind of comeback the president never delivered in their first debate. Near the end, the candidates turned to last month's attack on the U.S. consulate in Libya and the killing of the U.S. ambassador and three other Americans. The story out of the White House has evolved and changed over the past several weeks. Governor Romney accused the president of describing the attack as a spontaneous uprising rather than terrorism for political reasons. The president disagreed. (SOUNDBITE OF PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE) OBAMA: The day after the attack, governor, I stood in the Rose Garden and I told the American people and the world that we were going to find out exactly what happened, that this was an act of terror. And I also said that we're going to hunt down those who committed this crime. GONYEA: Romney immediately challenged the president's characterization of those remarks in the Rose Garden. (SOUNDBITE OF PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE) ROMNEY: I want to make sure to get that for the record, because it took the president 14 days before he called the attack in Benghazi an act of terror. OBAMA: Get the transcript. GONYEA: The president did use the word terror in his statement in the Rose Garden, as Candy Crowley noted last night, adding that others in the administration had also offered other explanations. The debate had already gone past the scheduled 90 minutes when the final question came. A man asked the two candidates about misperceptions people have about them. (SOUNDBITE OF PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE) ROMNEY: I think the president's campaign has tried to characterize me as someone who is very different than who I am. I care about 100 percent of the American people. I want 100 percent of the American people to have a bright and prosperous future. I care about our kids. GONYEA: Romney's answer was his last of the night, and it sounded like a closing statement. But President Obama used his to launch one final attack, knowing he was getting the last word, bringing up the hidden camera recording of Romney at a fundraiser early in the year. (SOUNDBITE OF PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE) OBAMA: But I also believe that when he said behind closed doors that 47 percent of the country considered themselves victims who refused personal responsibility, think about who he was talking about: folks on Social Security who've worked all their lives, veterans who've sacrificed for this country. GONYEA: With that, time had run out for this debate and grown very short for the campaign itself. The third and final debate is next Monday. Don Gonyea, NPR News, Hempstead, New York.

Each presidential and vice presidential debate lasts 90 minutes. If you watch political ads, though, they may seem to go on much longer. In the hours and days after the first presidential debate and this year's sole vice presidential version, both campaigns used debate footage in their ads \u2014 attempting to amplify messages, make counterarguments and drive the focus of the election. Expect the same after tonight's presidential debate, the year's only town hall-style showdown, which is being held at New York's Hofstra University. \"The debate is the most recent thing the candidate has said directly to the nation,\" Stanford University professor Jon Krosnick says. \"It's unfiltered, and I think it has particular news value.\" Mitt Romney was seen as the clear winner in the first debate. Just a few hours after it ended, the Obama campaign released an ad, \"Trust\", which attacked him for his debate remarks about taxes. A few days later, the campaign released its \"Big Bird\" ad, which made a point about federal spending priorities that many Democrats say the president failed to seize upon. \"The idea that a candidate might want to respond to his opponent later in a way that didn't come to mind during the debate seems like a very positive use of the advertising opportunity,\" Krosnick says. (Sesame Workshop later asked the Obama campaign to stop airing the ad, saying: \"We do not endorse candidates.\") The Romney campaign chose side-by-side footage from the debate for two of its ads, \"Helping the Middle Class\" and \"Putting Jobs First.\" Both highlight a downcast-looking Obama as Romney criticizes his tax plan. \"A picture can tell a thousand words. So when you have one candidate triumphantly articulating a point and the other, through his body language, coming across as listless or otherwise unimpressive, that has the potential to convey a very strong message to viewers,\" says Costas Panagopoulos, associate professor of political science at Fordham University. Another Romney campaign ad also draws attention to debate body language. The ad, \"Fiscal Discipline,\" contrasts a laughing Vice President Joe Biden with Rep. Paul Ryan's sober assessment of the economy. \"This is really the only time on the campaign trail where you have both candidates in a room together reacting to each other directly,\" Panagopoulos says. Debate footage can lend an impression of spontaneity to a candidate's words that cannot be duplicated in a stump speech or prepared remark, Panagopoulos says. \"One set of ads comes across as scripted or otherwise crafted by professionals and the other is really the candidates reacting to each other,\" he says. \"I think the latter has a greater potential to be impactful.\" Rollins College political science professor Rick Foglesong says post-debate ads can be powerful not just for the politicians, but also for voters, especially when the intent is to address factual disputes. While voters may not always seek out fact checkers independently, he says, the ads can bring those sources straight to their couches. \"I think there's something about the debates that causes a focus on style. The post-debate ads are an opportunity to refocus public opinion on substance,\" Foglesong says. \"Of course it's substance in quotation marks because that's politically defined, but it's probably a good thing.\"",

            "article_content": "The second presidential debate of this election season takes place Tuesday night at Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York. It will be moderated by CNN's Candy Crowley and will be done in a town hall-style. Democratic Strategist Tad Devine says the stakes could not be higher.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: It's MORNING EDITION from NPR News. I'm Steve Inskeep. RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: And I'm Renee Montagne, good morning. Presidential candidates play a game before debates, each lowers expectations that he'll do well, then tries to beat expectations. The last part didn't work out for President Obama this last time, so he tries again tonight. INSKEEP: The president meets Mitt Romney with their contest effectively tied. They hold a town hall meeting with about 80 uncommitted voters. MONTAGNE: CNN's Candy Crowley will moderate. Here's NPR's national political correspondent, Mara Liasson. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Democratic strategist Tad Devine says tonight the stakes could not be higher. By whiffing his first encounter with Governor Romney, President Obama has put tremendous pressure on himself. TAD DEVINE: Yeah, he has. I think that everybody, including the president, recognizes he had a very weak first debate performance. And this town hall meeting debate, he's going to have to perform much better. If he doesn't, Romney's going to be able to continue to build the momentum that came out of the first debate. And so what happens in this town hall meeting could determine the election's outcome. LIASSON: Romney, for the first time, is feeling the wind at his back. MITT ROMNEY: Now, you may have noticed that earlier in the week we had a debate. That was last week. And... (SOUNDBITE OF CHEERING) ROMNEY: ...that was that was a good debate. I enjoyed that debate. (SOUNDBITE OF CHEERING) LIASSON: Romney's top strategist, Ed Gillespie, told \"Fox News Sunday\" that tonight Romney will make the contrast with the president very clear. ED GILLESPIE: This is a big choice election. And the fact is, what we saw was, even if he changes his style - and whatever political tactic the president settles on as being in his best interest for this debate - he can't change his record and he can't change his policies. LIASSON: The Obama team has been promising a more aggressive approach tonight. But in a town hall debate format that could be hard to, say Tad Devine. DEVINE: And for the president, it's going to be a little difficult because everybody wanted him to be more aggressive - after that first debate. But this is not a format that rewards that kind of aggressiveness. So he's going to have to find the balance between connecting with people, answering their questions, being on their side. And also, making sure that Governor Romney doesn't do what he did in the first debate, which is essentially dominate the president; and also put forth policy positions that were different than the ones he had talked about for a long time in the campaign and get away with it. LIASSON: That's a very long list of goals to accomplish in one debate. The president has been prepping in private. And in public, he's trying out some humorous attack lines. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: After running for more than a year in which he called himself severely conservative, Mitt Romney's trying to convince you that he was severely kidding. (LAUGHTER) LIASSON: Another thing about town hall debates, they're unpredictable. And the audience provides the surprises like this plea the president got from voter Velma Hart at a town hall meeting in 2010. VELMA HART: I'm a wife. I'm an American veteran. And I'm one of your middle-class Americans. And quite frankly, I'm exhausted. I'm exhausted of defending you, defending your administration, defending the mantle of change that I voted for, and deeply disappointed with where we are right now. LIASSON: Or this man, who confronted Romney in a town hall meeting during the New Hampshire primary. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: You've said that corporations are people. But in the last two years corporate profits have surged to record highs, directly at the expense of wages. It seems that the U.S. is a great place to be a corporation, but increasingly a desperate place to live and work. LIASSON: Before the first debate with the president, Romney looked like he was on the verge of losing. But since then, says Republican strategist Terry Holt, he's turned the race into a dead heat nationally, and he's within striking distance in the Electoral College battleground. TERRY HOLT: The race has always been more fluid than I think some pollsters have tried to show us. This is a race between an incumbent that people want to like, but whose policies are unpopular, and a challenger who seems to have the right recipes of policies, but has failed to make a solid connection with the voters. What happened in the debate, in my view, the other night, was Mitt Romney finally got unplugged. He was in the spotlight and he demonstrated that he has leadership qualities, that he can stand toe-to-toe with the president. LIASSON: Expectations always play a huge role. Before Denver, most voters expected the president to dominate, but the opposite happened. So tonight, expectations will be a little higher for Romney. Tad Devine, who ran campaigns against Romney in Massachusetts, says tonight people will tune in just to see whether or not it's going to be a different show. DEVINE: Can the president come back? There's still a lot of interest now. You know, these debates are becoming like a mini-series on television, a dramatic mini-series. So I think the expectations this time for Governor Romney are going to be much higher. The expectations for the president, I don't think they've been diminished, even though he had a poor performance, but I think there are a lot of people out there wondering what's he going to do? LIASSON: So tonight is a real political cliffhanger, with the suspense all about President Obama and whether he can reverse Governor Romney's newfound momentum. Mara Liasson, NPR News, Washington.

The random cellphone and land line poll of 600 likely rural voters in nine battleground states Oct. 9-11 has Romney at 59 percent among the survey's respondents. Obama's support is now down to 37 percent among rural battleground voters, a plunge of 10 points from the actual rural vote in those states four years ago. \"What Republican candidates need to do is to rack up big margins in rural areas in order to offset smaller [Republican] margins in urban and suburban areas,\" says Dan Judy of North Star Opinion Research, the Republican polling firm that participated in the survey. About The Survey Dates: Oct. 9-11 Respondents: 600 likely voters in rural (nonmetropolitan) counties in nine battleground states. States: Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, Virginia, Wisconsin Sponsor: Center for Rural Strategies, a nonprofit and nonpartisan rural advocacy group based in Whitesburg, Ky. Funder: Carnegie Corporation of New York, a public foundation Polling Team: Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research (Democratic) and North Star Opinion Research (Republican) Margin of Error: +/- 4 percent Method: Random calls to cellphones and land lines Center For Rural Strategies Survey (PDF) \"Mitt Romney really needs to be at 60 percent or above in [rural] areas to offset some of those [urban and suburban] margins,\" Judy adds. The new survey shows \"he has surged into a huge lead, and I think it is fair to say that his increased lead among rural voters is what is helping him in these swing states overall.\" The nine battleground states of Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, Virginia and Wisconsin have a collective rural population of 13.6 million, according to the Census Bureau. \"It's a boon to Romney,\" says pollster Anna Greenberg of Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research, the Democratic partner in the survey. \"It will help him ... because, of course, he will lose urban areas by a similar margin. And the suburban areas are still pretty competitive.\" Last month, a similar rural survey in the same battleground states had a smaller 54-to-40 percent margin for Romney. Greenberg and Judy say the first presidential debate made the difference. \"Voters in rural areas were holding back from Mitt Romney for a variety of reasons, ranging from more conservative voters not being very high on him to the perception of him as an elite and out of touch,\" Greenberg says. \"The debate went a long way to making rural voters more comfortable with him in the way they were comfortable with George Bush.\" Judy notes that \"these really are Republican base voters ... coming home. They're 85 percent white, 50 percent conservative, and two-thirds of them attend church at least a couple of times a month.\" The first debate made a difference to Sarah Sajuan, 31, an assistant to a physical therapist in Paulding, Ohio. She shares Romney's social values, she says, but was offended by the surreptitious video in which the Republican presidential candidate was dismissive of what he said were the 47 percent of Americans dependent on government. \"I didn't like the negativity of the 'unimportant Americans,' \" Sajuan says. Before the debate, she leaned toward Obama, believing he would do a better job on taxes, rural issues, women's concerns and health care. \"I thought he was a stronger person and would stand up for what he believes in,\" Sajuan recalls. \"But after that debate it really made me question, maybe, his authority.\" Romney's debate performance wowed her due to \"his strength, his voice and just his appearance.\" So when pollsters called her last week, she told them she was casting her vote for Romney. She told NPR, though, that she may still change her mind.

Retired veterinarian Raymond Shuffler, 59, of Union Grove, N.C., says the last Republican presidential candidate he recalls voting for was Gerald Ford in 1976. But the first 2012 debate between Obama and Romney helped cement his commitment to the Republican. \"I think he's a man who can look at spending. He can look at taxes,\" Shuffler says. \"He's always been a competent manager.\" Shuffler voted for Barack Obama four years ago largely because he disagreed with John McCain's choice of Sarah Palin as the vice presidential nominee. He says he kept an open mind about supporting Obama again. \"His basic philosophy sounds good,\" Shuffler says of the president and his health care initiative. \"But his implementation of it is not working.\" Michael Roby, 65, a retired factory worker from Logan, Ohio, is leaning toward the president, crediting him with getting the Affordable Care Act passed. \"At least he moved it off the starting line,\" Roby says. He says the same about Obama's 2008 bailout of the financial system. \"Somebody's got to do something,\" he adds. But Roby admits to being persuadable. He'll record Tuesday night's second debate so he can go back and scrutinize it for who sounds better on maintaining and creating jobs, and bolstering Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. The rural voters responding to the survey overwhelmingly believe Romney will do a better job with the economy, with representing their views on taxes, with sharing their values, with saving Medicare and Social Security, with addressing the needs and concerns of the middle class and with reducing the federal deficit. On the president's Affordable Care Act, 60 percent said they disapproved. This is an educated voter group, by and large, with more than 60 percent saying they attended college, earned college degrees or studied in post-graduate school. Close to one-third collect Social Security and/or Medicare benefits. More than half are older than 50. President Obama rated almost even when it came to addressing the needs and concerns of women. He was close to even on which candidate would do a better job with women's health and which represents the respondents' views on health care, despite the strong disapproval of Obamacare. \"There are still issues that are contested in rural areas,\" says Democratic pollster Greenberg. \"It is possible [for Obama] to battle back.\" But Republican pollster Judy is skeptical. \"I think that Mitt Romney would have to have a pretty catastrophic performance [in the remaining debates] to lose some of the gains we've seen here,\" Judy says. Both Judy and Greenberg agree that Obama's rural battleground plunge could hurt Democrats who are seeking or trying to hold on to U.S. House and Senate seats in those same states. \"In these swing states, there are a lot of very, very close Senate races,\" Judy says. \"Whoever is able to prevail in these swing states will likely bring along enough Senate candidates to give his party control of the Senate.\" Greenberg adds that Romney's gargantuan lead in rural counties in battleground states makes it harder for Democrats to win Senate and Congressional races in rural states. \"It still can be done, and there are lots of really solid Democratic campaigns in these areas,\" Greenberg says. \"But it obviously makes it that much harder to win in those races.\" The survey was sponsored by the Center for Rural Strategies, a Kentucky advocacy group, and funded by the Carnegie Corporation of New York, a private foundation. Additional analysis of the survey is available at The Daily Yonder, a rural news service from the Center for Rural Strategies.",

Although more than 46 million Americans are poor, the issue has gotten little attention in the presidential race.\n                \n                    \n                    Mario Tama/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption People eat a free community meal at The Center in Lima, Ohio, earlier this year. Although more than 46 million Americans are poor, the issue has gotten little attention in the presidential race. The nation's poverty rate is as high as it's been in almost two decades. Last year, 1 in 6 Americans was poor \u2014 more than 46 million people, including 16 million children. But on the campaign trail, the issue of poverty has received surprisingly little attention. When he first ran for president, Barack Obama went to a low-income neighborhood in Washington, D.C., and spoke passionately about hunger and poverty. He repeated Bobby Kennedy's question in 1967: \"How can a country like this allow it?\" \"The most American answer I can think of to that question is two words: We can't. We can't allow this kind of suffering,\" then-candidate Obama told the crowd. But four years later, neither President Obama nor Republican Mitt Romney has focused much attention on the poor. They've talked about creating jobs and opportunity, but mostly for the middle class. Lack Of Attention Melissa Boteach heads Half in Ten, a campaign by progressive groups to cut poverty in half in 10 years. \"The problem is that when politicians talk about jobs, they don't talk about how they're going to reach the most vulnerable people who have been out of work for the longest time,\" she says. Her group and other anti-poverty advocates are so frustrated by the candidates' lack of attention to the topic, they've launched a Twitter campaign with the hashtag \"#talkpoverty.\" They're trying to get someone to ask the presidential candidates in the debates what they would do to reduce childhood poverty in their first 100 days. So far, they've had no luck. \"When you don't talk about something, it's hard to build the political will to implement it,\" says Boteach. Anti-poverty advocates say they're especially disappointed because they think Obama has a very good record to run on. They credit him with keeping millions of additional people out of poverty during the recession with stimulus spending on things such as expanded tax credits for low-income families, unemployment insurance and food stamps. And they note that his health care law will extend Medicaid coverage to millions of additional poor people. \"So that suggests that as we go forward, he's going to be able to do more,\" says Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed, a strong Obama backer. \"He has been a fierce defender of the Pell Grant program, which helps working folks access secondary education. He's focused on our technical colleges and two-year universities.\" And indeed, campaign aides say this is the president's plan to help the poor \u2014 that he's trying to build what he calls \"ladders of opportunity\" to lift people into the middle class. He spoke of those plans in his acceptance speech at the Democratic convention this summer. \"We believe the little girl who's offered an escape from poverty by a great teacher or a grant for college could become the next Steve Jobs, or the scientist who cures cancer or the president of the United States \u2014 and it is in our power to give her that chance,\" Obama told the crowd. A Different Approach But Republicans say one only has to look at the high poverty rate to see that Obama's approach has not worked. \"If someone's in poverty, what do you do about it?\" asks Kevin Hassett, an economist with the American Enterprise Institute and a Romney adviser. \"What you do is you fix the economy.\" Hassett says Obama's plan is largely to expand government aid, but he says it's this spending that's helping to keep the poor in poverty. \"We've got people in poverty that can't find a job [and] that have to rely upon the government safety net, which should be there to protect them,\" he says. \"But the reason they have to rely on the government safety net is that we have a president that hasn't thought, 'Geez, you know, being the highest corporate tax place on Earth is a bad idea.' \" Hassett says Romney would cut those taxes and the size of government so that the private sector has more money to create jobs. Still, Hassett says the Republican presidential candidate is committed to preserving the safety net for those who need it. But in a recent video he made for faith-based anti-poverty groups, Romney also said this: \"A strong economy will reduce our budget deficits, and it will reduce poverty as well. But at this point, budget cuts are also going to be necessary, and I intend to make them.\" Romney says he supports means testing so safety-net benefits will go to the neediest Americans, and he'd like to add work requirements for such aid. He also wants to turn programs like Medicaid and job training into block grants for the states, so they can shape them to better fit their needs. He says that's needed to strengthen the overall economy. Obama supporters argue that it will inevitably mean a lot less funding, and fewer poor people getting help.",

            "article_content": "One day after his debate with Paul Ryan, Vice President Joe Biden took to the campaign trail. He spoke at a rally in LaCrosse, Wis.  ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Robert Siegel. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: And I'm Audie Cornish. One day after their high energy debate, Vice President Joe Biden and Congressman Paul Ryan are both out on the campaign trail, each side trying to harness whatever momentum it can. Ryan joined Mitt Romney at a rally in Ohio. And Biden campaigned in Ryan's home state of Wisconsin. And we begin our program by hearing from both tickets. First, to NPR's Scott Horsley on the vice president's day. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: If President Obama practically sleepwalked through his first debate, running mate Joe Biden was extra caffeinated for his, verbally and non-verbally challenging Republican Paul Ryan at every turn. The vice president was still wide awake this afternoon when he recapped the debate before a friendly audience in Lacrosse, Wisconsin. VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Anyone who watched that debate, I don't think there's any doubt that Congressman Ryan and I, Governor Romney and the president, we have a fundamentally different vision for America and, quite frankly, a fundamentally different value set. HORSLEY: Biden delivered many of the attack lines last night that President Obama failed to in his debate, hammering at Mitt Romney's tax rate, which is lower than some middle class Americans, as well as Romney's 47 percent comment about people he said don't pay income tax and won't take responsibility for their own lives. Biden says many of those are working people, seniors or in the military. BIDEN: That's the 47 percent - the 47 percent this nation depends on to build this country. Folks, it's about time Governor Romney takes some responsibility - takes some responsibility to help the American people in the middle class. HORSLEY: Politically, both the vice president and Congressman Ryan serve as ambassadors to the middle class for running mates who can sometimes seem distant from it. Ryan noted during the debate that he and Biden grew up in similar communities. But, the vice president says he doesn't recognize the country that the Republican candidates describe. BIDEN: And I've got news for Governor Romney and Congressman Ryan - America is neither dependant nor is it in decline. And if they'd get out of the way - if they'd get out of the way with these policies out of the '50s, we'd be racing back. HORSLEY: President Obama watched the debate aboard Air Force One last night as he returned to Washington from a campaign event in Florida. Afterwards, the president told reporters Biden made a strong case and showed his passion for an economy that grows with the middle class. Mr. Obama will spend this weekend hunkered down in Williamsburg, Virginia, preparing for his own debate with Governor Romney in four days. Scott Horsley, NPR News, the White House.

In case you were distracted at all by the latter, here's some of what you may have missed: 1) Joe Biden still has his fastball.He will be 70 in a matter of weeks, but he can still step into a highly charged game situation with the bases loaded. He had his wits about him and his Irish up and did what his team needed done. In this case, his team was desperate for a save after President Obama, thought to be the ace of the Democrats' staff, turned in a memorably forgettable performance in the first debate. 2) Paul Ryan is fully ready for the major leagues.At just 42, he is still a new commodity on the national political market. He has never run even statewide before, and his first weeks as the vice presidential nominee did less for Mitt Romney's cause than the campaign had hoped. But he was fully ready to do battle with the sitting vice president, held the stage, got his lines in and showed both brainpower and boyish charm. 3) You have to swing the bat if you want to win. Biden went after Ryan on the details of Republican tax plans (which current deductions would be cut for the middle class?) and changes to Medicare and Social Security (precisely as the president had not). Ryan continued Romney's earlier assault on the Obama administration for its confusion regarding the Benghazi, Libya, consulate attack and for giving money to solar power projects that failed. 4) You have to be well-practiced to play position defense.Both men were quite aware of the likely points of attack they faced and were obviously prepared. At one point Ryan objected to Biden's repeated interruptions and said he understood Biden was \"under duress to make up for lost ground.\" But Biden was ready to point out Ryan's requests for grants under some of the very federal programs he called wasteful, as well as to note that Ryan's budget in Congress reduced funding for security at U.S. embassies and consulates. 5) Working the umps doesn't always work.Some conservatives had complained prior to the debate that moderator Martha Raddatz of ABC News had ties to the Obama-Biden ticket because the president, as a student, had attended her wedding to her first husband. But Raddatz ruled the evening with her expertise and evenhandedness, showing no signs of pressure or overcompensation. She set a new standard for moderating and may just have saved the concept of the debate moderator. 6) Sometimes it is better to sit and talk than to stand and fight.The expression is \"let's sit down and reason this out,\" and there is a reason. Having the debaters stand emphasizes ego and exposure and reinforces all the combat metaphors. Having them sit and converse with the moderator suggests an entirely different activity. 7) Winning one game is not the same as winning a series.We have not seen a presidential election decided by the vice presidential debate, nor even by the vice presidential candidates. But each contest in a series influences the dynamic of the next. Running mates can alter the impression the ticket makes, and their debates in the past affected the dynamic of the presidential clashes as well. George W. Bush doubtless drew strength from the performance of Dick Cheney in his meetings with Democrats Joe Lieberman (2000) and John Edwards (2004), both of which Cheney clearly dominated. But what really matters is how the No. 2 energizes and bolsters the No. 1. This VP debate filled the bill for both the president and his challenger, but it was the president who had to be the most grateful.",

            "article_content": "Vice President Joe Biden and GOP vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan engaged in a memorable and highly combative debate Thursday night in Danville, Kentucky. It's the only time the two men, who occupy the second spots on their party's presidential tickets, will square off before the election.  RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: It's MORNING EDITION from NPR News. I'm Renee Montagne. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: And I'm Steve Inskeep. Last night's vice presidential debate offered a reminder about American politics. It can be infuriating, misleading and irrelevant, but at its best politics becomes a spectacle - a highly informative show - which is what the vice presidential candidates delivered last night in a debate in Kentucky. It is hard to say if their spirited discussion changed any minds or won over undecided voters, but Republicans saw their candidate, Congressman Paul Ryan, contend solidly with his older opponent. Democrats found release in Biden's fierce correcting of the record - after President Obama's widely criticized showing last week. NPR's Don Gonyea reports. DON GONYEA, BYLINE: Debate moderator Martha Raddatz of ABC News started with the foreign policy issue of the day, Libya, and the attack last month that killed four Americans, including Ambassador Chris Stevens. (SOUNDBITE OF DEBATE) GONYEA: Biden began his answer... (SOUNDBITE OF DEBATE) GONYEA: But he quickly turned to a criticism of Governor Romney's foreign policy positions, signaling right away that he'd be much more aggressive than President Obama had been in last week's debate. Biden said the president has a strong record. He cited ending U.S. combat operations in Iraq and the killing of Osama bin Laden. He then pointed to a Mitt Romney line about bin Laden from years ago. (SOUNDBITE OF DEBATE) GONYEA: But Congressman Ryan followed by describing the events in Libya as, quote, \"emblematic of a chaotic foreign policy.\" (SOUNDBITE OF DEBATE) GONYEA: Next, another thorny foreign policy issue, nuclear weapons and Iran. Ryan called it another failure by the president. (SOUNDBITE OF DEBATE) GONYEA: Biden often reacted to Ryan's statements with disbelief and laughter - or with something like this... (SOUNDBITE OF DEBATE) GONYEA: On the economy, Biden said it was in freefall when the president took office.   He called it the great recession. Ryan countered... (SOUNDBITE OF DEBATE) GONYEA: Throughout the 90 minutes, Raddatz kept a rein on the combatants, giving them time to argue, but also keeping them on topic. Ryan defended his running mate against Democratic charges that he would have done nothing to help the auto industry when General Motors and Chrysler were near death's door in 2008 and 2009. Biden and the president frequently quote a newspaper editorial Romney wrote back then with the headline \"Let Detroit Go Bankrupt.\" (SOUNDBITE OF DEBATE) GONYEA: Ryan went on to describe how Romney visited that family one Christmas. (SOUNDBITE OF DEBATE) GONYEA: Here's Biden. (SOUNDBITE OF DEBATE) GONYEA: The exchanges were often heated. Each interrupted the other, though Biden was more aggressive on that score - a tactic widely predicted as a reaction to the president's low-key showing last week, prompting this from Ryan. (SOUNDBITE OF DEBATE) GONYEA: And they battled over whether Romney can cut tax rates across the board by 20 percent, as promised, and find enough current tax deductions to eliminate that he doesn't have to raise the final tax result for the middle class or add to the deficit. Biden said it is impossible. Here's Ryan... (SOUNDBITE OF DEBATE) GONYEA: The subject switched back to foreign policy and the wisdom of setting the firm timetable for pulling out of Afghanistan by 2014. There was agreement that the timetable is reasonable but by setting a hard date, Ryan said the administration helps the enemy. And he said it comes in the middle of a fighting season. He said that's a mistake. (SOUNDBITE OF DEBATE) GONYEA: Here is Biden... (SOUNDBITE OF DEBATE) GONYEA: And that's how much of this debate felt. Historically, vice presidential debates have not had a measurable effect on the election result, but they often contribute to the dynamics along the way. That may hold true this year. Ryan has proven he can hold his own against a seasoned opponent and Biden has shown that counterpunching may be the incumbents' best strategy in the next debate next week. Don Gonyea, NPR News, Danville, Kentucky. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) INSKEEP: Many people watched the debate last night with a device in hand. Twitter was exploding with commentary.

Tom Barnes\n                \n                    \n                    Liz Halloran/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Tom Barnes It's clear that he adores his daughter, Becky Barnes, 30, and takes pride in describing how she's taken a piece of the big family farm south of Columbus and turned it into an organic vegetable operation by dint of hard work and sheer determination. \"It's an amazing project out there,\" he says. What he says distresses him, however, are her political leanings. He's a Fox News conservative; she's an Obama Democrat. He worries that it's people like his own daughter (and maybe his wife, Karla, too, who plans to vote again for President Obama) who are \"taking the country down.\" Says Becky: \"We try not to talk about it.\" But the family, including Becky's older brother, Justin, 35, who also farms a piece of the family land, and his wife, Adrienne, 31, (both Mitt Romney supporters) agreed to let me join them to watch Vice President Joe Biden and GOP Rep. Paul Ryan spar in their only vice presidential debate. We gathered in Williamsport, where the entrepreneurial Barnes clan \u2014 including cousins and uncles and aunts \u2014 raise corn, soybeans, wheat, organic vegetables and honeybees, and even operate a golf course (which they built). Dinner was straight from Becky's farm. The discussion \u2014 and reaction to the debate \u2014 was equally as fresh and interesting, and as divided as the state of Ohio. Here's what they took away from Thursday night's debate \u2014 first, general consensus, then individual reactions: All of the Barnes' who gathered at Justin and Adrienne's home found the debate more confrontational than the presidential debate last week, and there was a mixed reaction to Biden's demeanor \u2014 his sardonic smile, head shaking, and conspiratorial looks at moderator Martha Radditz. Becky Barnes\n                \n                    \n                    Liz Halloran/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Becky Barnes And no consensus winner. \"I felt everyone felt that President Obama lost his debate because he wasn't at all confrontational, and that's why Biden needed to be more aggressive \u2014 it was planned,\" Becky said. Said Justin: \"I think Biden came across better than Obama. And his demeanor may have been effective \u2014 the fact that the audience gets to see how he's reacting, and they might think Ryan might not be telling the truth.\" Adrienne, however, thought it was off-putting: \"Immature.\" On the issues, no one mentioned the lengthy questions devoted to foreign policy, but the Barnes men said they would like to have heard more budget and job detail from Biden. They liked that Ryan ticked off five things the GOP ticket would do for the economy if elected. What struck Justin, however, and others, was how the debate seemed an extension of the dysfunction in Washington. \"The bickering bothers me \u2014 and the moderator gave them a chance to answer that question,\" Justin said, when she asked the candidates whether they were embarrassed by the tone of the campaign. \"Both of them should have apologized for it,\" he said. \"There was no winner here. There was so much defensiveness.\" About Biden, Becky said this: \"I really like Biden. I don't know why I get a kick out of him. I like his grin. He looked casual and mature.\" Her dad? \"The Republicans will say Ryan won, and the Democrats will say Biden won. I say Ryan won, and Romney-Ryan will win in November with 328 electoral votes.\" Here's more: Becky Barnes: An English and sociology graduate from Wittenberg University in Springfield, Ohio, she started her Dangling Carrot Farm six years ago. Health care is her big issue: \"I don't know all the specifics of Obama's plan, but I agree that the government should step in and regulate it a bit,\" she said, adding that she thought the president did a \"fine job\" in last week's presidential debate. Justin Barnes\n                \n                    \n                    Liz Halloran/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Justin Barnes \"When they hit on the tax issue \u2014 there's a clear difference. When Biden said he wanted to tax the rich more. I think Ryan and Romney's definition of what a small business is is different. I think Obama will raise taxes on people who maybe need their taxes raised. I know all of us in the middle class are supposed to be against raising taxes, but for some social programs I'd pay more. And that's why I vote for my side \u2014 Obama would have the social programs I agree with more than Romney. It's tough when they sign Grover Norquist's no-tax pledge.\" Justin Barnes: A graduate of Ohio State University with an agriculture degree, he's the father of four. His issues are \"getting the economy rolling, spending and balancing the budget.\" \"All this discussion is about things that are kind of small, relative to the big issue of the debt. If there's a message for someone like me, and I consider myself a Republican, it's not a race issue, or a religious issue, or an abortion issue. I think both Ryan and Romney are most effective when they hammer the issue of debt. This didn't do much for me. I didn't take anything away from it. I didn't learn much either way.\" Tom Barnes: Barnes taught school after graduating from Otterbein University and before going into farming. He says he's voting for Romney because \"I believe in conservatism and not socialism.\" In his view, Romney knows how to do a budget and has a better shot at getting things done in the gridlocked nation's capital. \"I'm disgusted with what's happened in Washington,\" he said. \"I would like to have more idea of what Biden's idea is to solve the debt crisis. I didn't hear it. I heard how Ryan/Romney will work on getting more jobs, all those five things he mentioned. I didn't hear any plan from Biden.

            "article_content": "Thursday night may be Representative Paul Ryan's first debate on a national television stage, but Vice President Joe Biden is an old hand. Four years ago he debated Sarah Palin, and before that he was on stage in the presidential primaries.  ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: Yesterday on the program we reported on Paul Ryan's debating style. We're going to do the same now for his opponent, Vice President Biden, who's an experienced debater. Here's NPR's Brian Naylor. BRIAN NAYLOR, BYLINE: Joe Biden has been pilloried by the right as a gas machine. He's been parodied by The Onion as a bare-chested, Trans Am driving ladies man. But when it comes to debating, the vice president is no joke. He's been around the block, as he might tell you, literally. Alan Schroeder is a journalism professor at Northeastern University and author of \"Presidential Debates: 50 Years of High Risk TV.\" Schroeder says Biden is a skilled debater. ALAN SCHROEDER: Although it is true that he's had his share of gaffes, a lot of that, it seems to me, has taken place in a context other than debates in front of friendly crowds where he feels comfortable and maybe lets his guard down a little. I think in the debate he's really engaged in the moment. NAYLOR: Biden's biggest debate stage was four years ago when he faced off with then GOP vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin. More than 70 million watched, more than watched the presidential debates that year. Many were, no doubt, curious about Palin and curious about how Biden would deal with her. Schroeder says Biden did what he needed to do. SCHROEDER: With Palin, he was really very gracious. He did not do anything that in any way was condescending to her or that pointed out the vast difference in their level of experience. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED DEBATE) NAYLOR: Biden also debated his rivals for the 2008 presidential nomination some 14 times before dropping out of the contest. He displayed a command of the facts and, says Schroeder, humor. SCHROEDER: There is a moment where's he's asked this question about, you know, given that you have this reputation for being long-winded, could you do the job of president and be able not to talk about it? (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED DEBATE) NAYLOR: And Biden is responsible for what Schroeder calls one of the classic debate soundbites of all time, a put-down of Rudy Giuliani. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED DEBATE) NAYLOR: One of Biden's strength as a candidate is his empathy and an ability to relate to middle class voters. That, too, was on display in his debate four years ago with Sarah Palin. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED DEBATE) NAYLOR: The importance of tonight's debate for Democrats has been magnified by the widely panned performance of President Obama in his debate with Mitt Romney last week. Biden's mission in tonight's forum is to change the narrative, says Joel Goldstein, who studies the vice presidency at St. Louis University. And in one respect, Goldstein says Biden has an advantage, talking up the president, that Paul Ryan doesn't have with Romney. JOEL GOLDSTEIN: Biden is in a better position, I think, to defend and to sell Obama than Ryan is. Biden can talk about the fact that he's been working with him for four years. He's sat there in the situation room and so forth, whereas Ryan really has two months of association to draw from. NAYLOR: Biden is also likely to take on Ryan over his budget and tax proposals, but his biggest challenge tonight may simply be to do no further harm to the president's chances on Election Day.

            "article_content": "Tonight's faceoff between Vice President Joe Biden (right) and GOP Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin will likely be an important stage-setter for next week's second presidential debate.\n                \n                    \n                    Jose Luis Magana/Thanassis Stavrakis/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Tonight's faceoff between Vice President Joe Biden (right) and GOP Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin will likely be an important stage-setter for next week's second presidential debate. It may be the undercard to the main event, but partisans on both sides are talking some trash ahead of the vice presidential debate tonight in Danville, Ky. The pressure is particularly intense on Vice President Joe Biden, following his boss' lackluster performance in last week's presidential debate, which moved GOP nominee Mitt Romney into a national polling lead. Republicans have been gleefully anticipating this confrontation for months, believing Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, the No. 2 on the GOP ticket, has the intellectual firepower to make gaffe-prone Biden look foolish. \"It's the man with the 200-pound brain vs. Crazy Uncle Joe,\" says Ed Goeas, a Republican pollster. Democrats believe Biden will come well-prepared and be able to expose what they see as the duplicity of the Romney-Ryan ticket, which has appeared to shift positions in recent days on issues such as abortion, education and tax policy. \"I just think Paul Ryan is the Eddie Haskell of American politics, with this transparent two-facedness,\" says Paul Glastris, a former speechwriter for President Bill Clinton and editor in chief of The Washington Monthly, referring to a smarmy character on the 1950s sitcom Leave It to Beaver. Vice presidential debates are often quickly forgotten, but this one will likely be widely watched and at the very least serve as an important table-setter in advance of the second presidential debate Tuesday in New York. \"It will be very substantive, with probably two of the most substantive vice presidential candidates we've ever had,\" says David Carney, a Republican consultant. \"I think Biden's performance, in an ironic way, will put more pressure on [President] Obama for the next debate.\" Linking Politics And Policy Four years ago, the vice presidential debate between Biden and Republican Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska actually drew higher TV ratings than any of that year's presidential debates. This one also will draw considerable attention. \"Because of the somewhat surprising but dramatic nature of Romney's performance last time, the stakes and the interest in this one are higher than normal,\" says Joel Goldstein, a law professor at Saint Louis University and expert on the vice presidency. Biden's task tonight is different from what it was four years ago. Then, he essentially ignored Palin in favor of attacking Arizona Sen. John McCain, the GOP nominee. This time, he'll still want to concentrate most of his fire on the other party's presidential candidate, but he will doubtless also use Ryan as a target. As the House Budget Committee chairman, Ryan is the architect of a spending plan that Democrats warn would gut domestic programs and threaten entitlements such as Medicare. \"Where Gov. Romney muddied the water, I think the vice president will try to clarify it,\" says Jared Bernstein, who served as an economic adviser to Biden in the White House. \"He's going to link the political agendas and the policy agendas so the electorate has a much better understanding than they did from the first debate.\" Ryan On Offense Since his selection as running mate, Ryan has served as the loyal soldier, shying away from some of the implications of his own budget and declaring that Romney sets the policy for the ticket. But if Democrats accuse the Republicans of duplicity, Republicans counter that Democrats have mismanaged the economy and don't have a record worth running on and so are relying on scare tactics. Goeas, the GOP pollster, predicts Ryan will drive home the point that, counter to Democratic claims, the Republican plan would not alter Medicare for those ages 55 and older. \"Certainly, Ryan's quite comfortable on the economic stuff, but the ticket is also emphasizing more foreign policy in recent weeks because of that Benghazi mess,\" says Gary Bauer, president of American Values, a conservative group concerned with social issues. \"If that comes up, I would expect Ryan to be on the attack and Biden on the defensive.\" Republicans also hope that, under pressure, Biden could once again uncork a comment that takes on a life of its own. As Goldstein points out, one gaffe can undo all the other successful messaging a vice presidential candidate might pull off during a debate. Last week, Biden attacked the GOP tax plan, but in so doing offered what sounded like a criticism of his own administration by saying the middle class has \"been buried the last four years.\" \"He's had a bad run of foot-in-mouth disease,\" says David Yepsen, director of a public policy institute at Southern Illinois University Carbondale. \"He really needs to avoid any of that. Part of getting Democrats back on track is having Joe Biden not make gaffes.\" Contrast In Styles But Biden's gaffes tend to come \"from unregulated exuberance on the campaign trail,\" Bauer says. He'll presumably be more disciplined on stage during his key moment in the entire campaign. And Republicans who have anticipated Ryan overmatching the vice president are likely to be disappointed. Biden spent 36 years in the Senate, chairing important committees in charge of both domestic and foreign issues. \"Paul Ryan is a wonk at heart \u2014 he's the brains of this particular Congress,\" says Tara McGuinness, executive director of the Center for American Progress Action Fund, the progressive think tank's advocacy wing. \"Joe Biden, though very experienced in politics, is a storyteller at heart,\" she says. \"It will be a strong contrast between Paul Ryan's actuarial style and Joe Biden's straight-talking, storytelling, tell-it-like-it-is campaign style.\" Ryan, who was born two years before Biden was first elected to the Senate, needs to show he has some \"gravitas,\" Yepsen says. Republicans from Romney on down have tried to downplay expectations for Ryan's performance in recent days, pointing out that he hasn't engaged in a campaign debate since he first ran for Congress 14 years ago. Ted Kaufman, a longtime Biden aide who succeeded him in the Senate after his ascension to the vice presidency, says Ryan will be ready. \"Ryan will do a good job,\" Kaufman says. \"Anyone who has been a member of Congress for 14 years knows how to present their positions well and how to challenge the positions of the other side.\"",

            "article_content": "In an interview with the editorial board of the Des Moines Register, GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney said anti-abortion legislation would not be part of his White House agenda. But the campaign dialed back the remarks, saying Romney is \"proudly pro-life\" and \"will be a pro-life president.\" But the episode is part of a larger pattern of moves toward the center by Romney.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: This week in Iowa, the Des Moines Register asked Mitt Romney about abortion. Romney replied: There's no legislation with regards to abortion that I'm familiar with that would become part of my agenda. Democrats immediately noted that during the Republican primary campaign Romney actually wrote an article headlined, \"My Pro-Life Pledge\" that promised specific legislation. Much of his political base is pro-life and his campaign quickly clarified that Romney remains proudly pro-life and would support pro-life legislation. This episode came during a broad effort by Romney to move to the political center, which presents challenges to President Obama. Here's NPR's Ari Shapiro. ARI SHAPIRO, BYLINE: At the beginning of this presidential race, the Obama campaign had to make a choice. Should the president attack Mitt Romney as a shape shifter or portray her as an extreme right winger. They decided to call him an extremist. (SOUNDBITE OF POLITICAL ADS) SHAPIRO: For months, Romney did not directly respond to those attack ads. In fact, the Republican primary forced him to play right into the caricature. MITT ROMNEY: I was a severely conservative Republican governor. SHAPIRO: President Obama steadily built up a lead among key voter groups that disliked the idea of a severely conservative president. Women especially, gave Mr. Obama a firewall against his challengers advantage among white men. Then came last week's presidential debate and a dramatic shift. Romney said this about Wall Street regulations. ROMNEY: We're not going to get rid of all regulation. You have to have regulation and there are some parts of Dodd-Frank that make all the sense in the world. SHAPIRO: He said this about bipartisanship. ROMNEY: Actually, the day after I get elected, I'll sit down with leaders, the Democratic leaders as well as Republican leaders. SHAPIRO: And he said this about what he would put in place of the president's healthcare law. ROMNEY: Preexisting conditions are covered under my plan. SHAPIRO: That's not entirely true. Romney would guarantee coverage for people with preexisting conditions who already have insurance, but insurance companies could still deny coverage to uninsured people with preexisting conditions. The Obama campaign accused the challenger of keeping this famous promise from Romney advisor Eric Fernstrom. ERIC FERNSTROM: I think you hit a reset button for the fall campaign. Everything changes. It's almost like an Etch-a-Sketch. You can kind of shake it up and restart all over again. SHAPIRO: Whether this move is a political calculation or the real Mitt Romney coming through, it appears to be working. In the last week, Mitt Romney has closed the gap in polls. That's true across the board, including with key swing voter groups such as women. Sandra Mizer is treasurer for Knox County, Ohio. She attended a Romney town hall meeting yesterday. SANDRA MIZER: Before, I felt that women, in particular, and the whole population in general, only saw the attack ads and I think at the debate, they saw the real people who were running for president of the United States. SHAPIRO: Housewife, Char Levingston(ph) shares that view. CHAR LEVINGSTON: People finally now understanding really what Romney is about. I think they're finally getting to realize the kind of man and what he stands for, and his actual, you know, views and opinions, not just all the negative ads that, you know, you see on TV. SHAPIRO: Even Obama supporter, Don Russell(ph) of Mount Vernon, Ohio, thinks the real Mitt Romney is the one who merged over the last week. DON RUSSELL: I think Romney switches his view quite often. I think he's more moderate and I think he's just leaning way to the right, just out of pressure. SHAPIRO: That view is dangerous for the Obama campaign. Aides like David Plouffe are trying to argue that the real Mitt Romney is still an extremist. DAVID PLOUFFE: Romney will try and say anything to get a political advantage in the moment. But again, we're gonna make sure people understand what he will do as president. Those cuts in education, the vouchers for Medicare, the huge tax cuts for the wealthy paid for by the middle class exploding the deficit, this is what he's going to do. SHAPIRO: If that's the message President Obama hoped to deliver at last week's debate, he apparently failed. The big question now is whether Mitt Romney has enough time left to cement this newly emerging picture of him with less than a month until the election.

Vice President Biden and his Republican opponent, Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, had a lively debate at Centre College in Danville, Ky., this evening \u2014 one marked by Biden's aggressive challenges to many of the Republican vice presidential nominee's claims and Ryan's oft-repeated message that the Obama-Biden administration's policies aren't working. The discussion was steered by ABC News' Martha Raddatz. It's the only vice presidential debate of the campaign. There were disputes about the response to last month's attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, how to keep Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons, health care policy and taxes, and over which ticket has the better plan for getting the economy moving. Through the evening, we watched for ALERTs: \"A Line Everybody [will] Remember Tomorrow.\" They're flagged below. Both candidates, NPR Senior Washington Editor Ron Elving said afterward, \"were strong and they were strong in the way that they wanted to be strong.\" Ryan \"made the Romney-Ryan case\" and Biden came back \"point for point.\" Much was at stake. Last week's presidential debate, which we live blogged, is widely seen as having given a bump to the Republican ticket, headed by former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney. Polls show most Americans who watched that debate thought he did a better job than President Obama. We updated before and during the debate. We'll do the same during next Tuesday's second debate between the president and Romney. Update at 10:35 p.m. ET. In Closing, Biden Talks Of Those Who Just \"Want A Shot\"; Ryan Talks Of \"A Clear Choice\": In his closing statement, Biden returns to Romney's comments about the \"47 percent\" and to Ryan's having said that 30 percent of Americans \"are takers.\" \"He's talking about my mother and father,\" Biden says, and \"the people who built this country. All they're looking for is a shot. ... The president and I are not going to rest until the playing field is level.\" Ryan uses his closing to talk about \"the clear choice\" he says voters have between the current administration that promotes \"more spending, more borrowing, higher taxes and a government takeover of health care. ... It's not working.\" Update at 10:28 p.m. ET. \"Attack, Blame And Defame\": Raddatz wants to know what the men would say to a veteran who is upset at the tone of the campaign. Biden says both sides have said things they probably regret, but that he would also want to assure that veteran that Obama is a president who has \"acted wisely in the use of force\" while Romney has been guilty of \"slipshod comments\" about foreign affairs. Ryan talks of Obama as being a president who promised \"hope and change\" but has instead \"turned this campaign into attack, blame and defame.\" Another ALERT? (a Line Everybody [will] Remember Tomorrow). Update at 10:22 p.m. ET. Abortion: Raddatz asks the men to talk personally about their positions on abortion. Ryan talks of his belief that life begins at conception and says the policy of a Romney-Ryan administration will be to oppose abortion except in cases of rape, incest or a threat to the life of the mother. Biden says he accepts the Catholic Church's teaching on abortion, but also that \"I refuse to impose it\" on others. Update at 10:12 p.m. ET. Statements Are Not Going Unchallenged, Particularly By Biden: President Obama was criticized, even by some of his supporters, for not challenging Romney during last week's debate. Biden is not going to get similar criticism. He's been interrupting Ryan and challenging statements throughout the debate. Moments ago, for example, Ryan said there aren't enough U.S. troops in eastern Afghanistan. \"You'd rather Americans be going in to do the job?\" Biden interjected. \"We're sending in more Afghans to do the job.\" Ryan has been taking a slightly different approach. He's been less focused on challenging Biden's claims and more focused on making sure he gets certain messages across. Notably, he's said several times that the Obama foreign policy is \"unraveling\" and leading other nations to believe America is weakening. Update at 10:05 pm. ET. On Afghanistan, Some Agreement: Ryan says the Republican ticket agrees with the administration's goal of having all U.S. combat troops out of Afghanistan in 2014. One area of disagreement, he says, is that \"we would have more likely taken into account recommendations from commanders\" about troop levels this year and not withdrawn the \"surge\" troops as quickly as they have been. Biden speaks plainly about the plan. \"We are leaving, we are leaving in 2014, period,\" he says. Republicans, he adds, want to add a clause that withdrawal of troops \"depends\" on conditions. \"It does not depend on us,\" says Biden. American troops will be out of the country by then no matter what. Update at 9:55 p.m. ET. Taxes: Raddatz asks each candidate who would pay more and who would pay less in taxes if they are elected? Biden says under Obama-Biden the \"middle class will pay less and people earning $1 million\" will pay more. Ryan doesn't directly answer. When Raddatz presses for specifics on the Romney-Ryan tax plan, he responds that voters should \"look at what Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill did\" \u2014 in other words, that a Romney-Ryan administration would work across party lines but doesn't want to lay out specifics now. The two disagree on whether simply cutting taxes can boost job growth. Ryan says it happened under President Kennedy. \"Oh, now you're Jack Kennedy!\" Biden responds with a shocked look. That could be another ALERT (a Line Everybody [will] Remember Tomorrow). Update at 9:43 p.m. ET. Repeating The $716 Billion Debate: Ryan repeats a charge that has come up again and again during the campaign: that Obamacare takes $716 billion out of Medicare. \"They got caught with their hands in the cookie jar,\" he says. Not true, responds Biden, who says \"we cut the cost of Medicare and stopped overpaying\" to providers and insurers. The Obama plan, he says, \"extended the life of Medicare to 2024.\" The Romney-Ryan plan, he argues, would make Medicare insolvent in 2016. Update at 9:30 p.m. ET. A Zinger About Biden's Gaffes: After Biden's comments about what Romney said concerning the \"47 percent,\" Ryan gets off an ALERT (a Line Everybody [will] Remember Tomorrow). The vice president surely knows, Ryan says, that \"sometimes the words don't come out of your mouth the right way.\" That indirect reference to the vice president's penchant for gaffes gets a big laugh from the audience. Says Biden: \"But I always say what I mean.\" Update at 9:27 p.m. ET. The 47 Percent Gets Its Mention: At last week's presidential debate, President Obama never mentioned Romney's comments about the \"47 percent\" who don't pay income taxes and won't support the Republican ticket. Biden dives right into the subject after Raddatz asks about the economy and jobs. After saying the Obama administration will get the jobless rate under 6 percent in a second term, Biden says \"I've had it up to here with this notion that 47 percent\" of Americans aren't doing their share. Instead of pledging not to ever raise taxes, he says, Republicans should be \"signing a pledge to the middle class that we're going to level the playing field.\" Ryan responds that when Obama-Biden took office, the jobless rate in Biden's hometown of Scranton, Pa., was 10 percent and it's still 8.5 percent. \"That's how it's going\" across the nation, he says. Update at 9:24 ET. Ryan Pushes On Iran; Biden Pushes Back: Ryan says the Obama administration \"has no credibility on the issue\" of how to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons because Obama has allegedly \"watered down sanctions, delayed sanctions.\" \"It's incredible,\" Biden responds. \"Imagine if we had let a Republican Congress work out the sanctions. ... Do you think there's any possibility the entire world would have joined us [in] the most crippling sanctions ever?\" Ryan says \"the ayatollahs\" are \"spinning the centrifuges faster.\" Biden says all he's hearing from the Republicans is \"bluster ... and loose talk.\" Does Ryan want war with Iran, he asks. Update at 9:13 p.m. ET. Sharp Disagreement On Libyan Attack And What It Symbolizes: The first question is about the Sept. 11 attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya, that left the U.S. ambassador and three other Americans dead. Raddatz asks if it was a \"massive intelligence failure.\" Biden calls it a \"tragedy\" and then turns to ticking off what he sees as President Obama's foreign policy accomplishments, including the killing of Osama bin Laden. Ryan asks why \"the ambassador in Paris has a Marine unit protecting him,\" but the ambassador to Libya didn't. He calls the attack in Benghazi a symbol of \"the unraveling of the Obama foreign policy.\" Biden says \"that's a bunch of malarkey\" and says \"the congressman, here, cut embassy security\" in budgets he has proposed. Malarkey = our first ALERT of the evening (a Line Everybody [will] Remember Tomorrow). Update at 9:01 p.m ET. It's On: The candidates have taken their seats (they're at a table with Raddatz) and things are getting started. As we said before, there are supposed to be nine sections of roughly 10 minutes each and they'll be asked about domestic and foreign policy issues. A coin toss has determined that Biden will respond first to the initial question. Update at 8:45 p.m. ET. Scaled-Back Expectations, Viewerwise: Before last week's presidential faceoff, debate commission Co-Chairman Frank Fahrenkopf told the audience that \"50 to 100 million\" Americans would be watching. He just told the audience at tonight's event that \"50 or 60 million\" voters might be tuning in. Vice presidents, apparently, get lower forecasts. And how many did tune in to the first Obama-Romney debate? About 67.2 million. Update at 8:30 p.m. ET. The Prelude: The major broadcasters aren't showing it, but C-SPAN has gone live to the debate hall for the opening announcements from the officials of the Commission on Presidential Debates. So, things are getting started. Update at 8:15 p.m. ET. What Does Each Man Need To Do? This afternoon, NPR Senior Washington Editor Ron Elving told our Newscast Desk that that even though Ryan is a member of the House and a committee chairman there, \"because he has never run statewide in Wisconsin \u2014 [and] he's never run for national office \u2014 he's going to need to show that he's ready to be seen at that level of the game.\" Biden, \"who's been around for quite a long time,\" needs to show he is \"still sharp enough, still full of energy enough, is still clear-minded enough and clearsighted enough to handle this kind of debate pressure and to handle the pressure of the job of being right next door, a heartbeat away, from the Oval Office.\" Update at 8:05 p.m. ET. Buzzwords And Things To Watch For: Before nights like these, news outlets love to do lists covering what to watch and listen for. Here are three that come from different angles: -- NPR.org has the budget-focused \"Beep If You Understand Veep Buzzwords.\" Here's one: \"loophole.\" A polite definition is \"gray area in the tax code.\" -- Politico has zeroed in on \"5 Things To Watch In VP Debate.\" No. 1 is \"Can Biden Draw Blood?\" -- ABC News goes one better than the typical Top 10 list with \"11 Things You Will Hear Tonight.\" Update at 7:50 p.m. ET. First Roman Catholic VP Could Be Followed By Second: As The Washington Post noted earlier today, \"with the momentum in Romney-Ryan's favor, America's first Catholic vice president is under even more pressure than the man who wants to become the second.\" As you can see in NPR.org's \"tale of the tape\" look at Biden and Ryan, the two men share at least one thing \u2014 their religion. On key issues, though, they have significant differences. Biden, for instance, is an \"advocate for Obama's health care overhaul, which he once advised the president to delay given harsh economic conditions.\" Ryan \"opposes Obamacare; wrote a budget plan that secures savings by converting Medicare from a guaranteed benefits to a voucher plan, and Medicaid to a state block grant program tied to inflation.\" The two men are also from different generations. Biden is 69. Ryan is 42. Update at 7:35 p.m. ET. What's The Format? \"The debate will cover both foreign and domestic topics and be divided into nine time segments of approximately 10 minutes each,\" the Commission on Presidential Debates says. \"The moderator will ask an opening question, after which each candidate will have two minutes to respond. The moderator will use the balance of the time in the segment for a discussion of the question.\"",

For our series First and Main, Morning Edition is traveling to contested counties in swing states to find out what is shaping voters' decisions this election season. The latest trip took us to Larimer County, Colo. I'm embarrassed to admit that I don't have any memories of the presidential election that took place while I was in college. It was my freshman year, and President Clinton was running for re-election against former Republican Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas. Clinton won, in case you've forgotten. It's not that I could have voted \u2014 my 18th birthday wasn't for another week or so. But I don't even remember being aware that there was an election going on \u2014 which is a far cry from the five students we spent time with on the Colorado State University campus in Fort Collins. Granted, they're all political science majors. But they're following their candidates' positions and policies closely, and weren't at all shy about sharing their opinions on presidential politics.

We sat down with these students \u2014 Democrats, Republicans and a libertarian \u2014 around a table in a seminar classroom in CSU's Political Science Department on a rainy September morning. The two Republicans \u2014 Rachel Drechsler and Tyler Marr \u2014 were going to a campaign event later that morning for GOP vice presidential candidate Paul Ryan. Because she was giving an introductory speech at the rally, Drechsler was dressed for the part, wearing a skirt and jacket and a pair of hot-pink heels. Both she and Marr seemed very enthusiastic about the Romney/Ryan ticket. On the other side of the table were the two Democrats, Abby Harder and Carol Kennedy. While both say they believe that President Obama is still the best candidate, they admitted that they aren't as excited about him as they were in 2008 (even though only Harder was old enough to vote at that point). Rounding out the group was Justin Rampy, the sole libertarian in the room. He's a Ron Paul supporter who said he hopes to send a message to both parties. \"To say that I'm not going to vote Republican or Democrat tells both parties that there are voters like me out there who are fed up voting for either party,\" he said. Among the topics that came up was the increasing cost of education. Both Harder and Marr said they have smaller loans to supplement financial help they've received from their families. Of the five, only Rampy had significant student loan debt \u2014 which, as he pointed out, is a big burden to have when just entering the workforce. Despite disagreements on how the rising cost of education should be addressed, all five students saw it as a problem \u2014 but not one that played a big role for them in this election. The issue of women's rights also came up in discussion, and the majority of the students came down in favor of abortion rights. Drechsler recognized that her stance differed from that of her party's, but she said she felt that more important than the issue of abortion was making sure the economic needs of women are being met. \"I want a better future for my kids and for their kids and for everyone in America,\" she said. \"And I think the way we're headed, that's not going to be the case. And so I think, as a woman, I just want to make sure that our well-being is taken care of.\" In fact, the economy seemed to be the issue of most concern to all of the students. They were keenly aware that the current job market isn't a good one for newly minted college graduates, and they expressed worry over the size of the deficit. Unsurprisingly, the Democrats and the Republicans stuck close to party lines on this subject. But while it's not the only issue they're voting on, it's certainly the one most prominent in their minds right now.

Tea Party-backed GOP state Treasurer Richard Mourdock is locked in a close race with House Democrat Joe Donnelly, who has represented Indiana's 2nd Congressional District since 2007. How Mourdock got there is as interesting as the race itself. In a stunning primary upset in May, he knocked off Richard Lugar, the six-term GOP senator known for his willingness to cross the aisle on key issues. Mourdock immediately hit the TV news shows and proclaimed that \"bipartisanship ought to consist of Democrats coming to the Republican point of view.\" Mourdock's opponent is a conservative \"Blue Dog\" Democrat, and the two are not far apart on many issues. That has brought the issue of bipartisanship to the forefront, says Peri Arnold, a political science professor at the University of Notre Dame in South Bend, Ind. The latest poll shows the two candidates running neck and neck, with the edge to Donnelly. Arnold says Republicans hoping to pick up enough seats next month to win control of the Senate risked a sure thing with Lugar and placed all their Tea Party chips on the campaign table with Mourdock. \"My sense is that Lugar could have easily won the general election,\" he says. Here's a side-by-side comparison of Mourdock, 60, and Donnelly, 57. Candidates: Richard Mourdock // Joe Donnelly Elective Office Mourdock: Indiana state treasurer, 2007-present; county commissioner, Vanderburgh County Board of Commissioners, 1995-2002 Donnelly: U.S. House of Representatives, 2007-present Dumb Move Mourdock: Recorded and accidentally uploaded to YouTube four possible responses to the Supreme Court's decision on President Obama's health care law before the decision was handed down. The gaffe inspired a Stephen Colbert parody. Donnelly: Creating an ambitious \"Republicans for Donnelly\" drive that fizzled. 2012 Money Race Mourdock: $4 million raised; $3 million spent as of June 30 (latest available data), with 12 percent coming from political action committees. Donnelly: $2.6 million raised; $1.2 million spent as of June 30, with 32 percent coming from political action committees. Issues Abortion Mourdock: Opposes abortion. Believes Roe v. Wade \"is a serious misreading of the Constitution.\" Has said he would support legal abortion in the case of some \"crisis pregnancies.\" Donnelly: Opposes abortion. National Right to Life Committee says, \"Joe Donnelly supported the interests of the National Right to Life Committee 83 percent [of the time] in 2010.\" Guns Mourdock: Says he \"oppose[s] restrictions on gun ownership by law-abiding citizens.\" Donnelly: Says he supports the Second Amendment right to bear arms. Voted for a bill to establish a national standard for carrying of concealed firearms across state lines. Bipartisanship Mourdock: On MSNBC in May: \"To me, the highlight of politics, frankly, is to inflict my opinion on someone else with a microphone or in front of a camera to win them over to my point of view.\" On Fox News: \"I have a mindset that says bipartisanship ought to consist of Democrats coming to the Republican point of view.\" Has since indicated that he'll work with Democrats. Donnelly: At an August appearance in Fort Wayne, Ind.: \"We don't expect a my-way-or-the-highway attitude; we expect getting things done.\" Taxes Mourdock: Has signed Grover Norquist's \"Taxpayer Protection Pledge\" vowing not to raise taxes. Donnelly: Supports \"responsible efforts to promote tax relief to help small businesses and middle-class families and keep our economy healthy,\" according to his campaign website. Biography Mourdock: Wife, Marilyn. He runs marathons and holds a pilot's license. Donnelly: Two children with wife, Jill, whom he met while attending the University of Notre Dame. Religion Mourdock: Evangelical Christian Donnelly: Roman Catholic Higher Education Mourdock: Masters in geology, Ball State University, 1975 Donnelly: Law degree from Notre Dame, 1981 Career Mourdock: Indiana state treasurer, 2006-present; co-founded Sub-Tech Environmental Services, a consulting business, 2000; vice president at Koester Companies (earth-moving equipment) in Evansville, Ind., 1984-2000; senior geologist, Standard Oil of Ohio, 1979-1984 Donnelly: Practiced law until 1996, when he opened Marking Solutions, a printing and rubber stamp company.

With 27 days until the general election, Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney was on an Iowa farm Tuesday where he did what he's done for months: criticized President Obama's economic policies, though his critique understandably had an agricultural slant. But the Republican presidential nominee also did something he hasn't done much of before now: He told the kind of personal anecdotes meant to reveal his softer side to help voters connect with him more easily. President Obama at Ohio State University in Columbus on Tuesday.\n                \n                    \n                    Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption President Obama at Ohio State University in Columbus on Tuesday. Obama, for his part, continued to try to work his way out of the hole he created for himself with his rambling and passive debate performance last week. At a campaign rally, he opened his speech with a compact list of his achievements, many of them 2008 campaign promises he has kept. And while he failed to attack Romney in the debate, Obama has steadily poured criticism on his rival since the two men left the stage in Denver. The president continued that criticism in Ohio. At a farm in Van Meter, Iowa, Romney criticized Obama for regulatory, tax, energy and trade policies that he said hurt American farmers. For instance, he said, \"The regulatory burden under this administration has just gone crazy.\" Romney charged that under Obama the federal government tried to regulate rainwater in ditches on farms, dust levels and the types of farm jobs teenagers could perform. A few minutes later, Romney departed from policy to take a more personal turn. He told the kinds of stories he rarely if ever would share before now on the campaign trail. His family has reportedly pressed his advisers to allow him to tap into this side of his biography in an attempt to humanize him more for voters. So Romney told of a cancer-stricken teenager whom he had befriended years ago. The teenager, Romney recounted, bravely asked him to help write his last will and testament so his skateboard and other youthful possessions could be properly distributed to friends on his death. The story allowed Romney to describe the young man with a line that has become something of a campaign slogan recently for the GOP candidate: \"Clear eyes, full heart, can't lose.\" Romney also told of going to a neighborhood house party that he had mistakenly thought he and his wife, Ann, had been invited to. There, he said, he met a former Navy SEAL \u2014 the same SEAL who was killed in the recent attack in Benghazi, Libya, along with the U.S. ambassador to the country. Romney was visibly emotional as he told this story. Meanwhile Obama, at a rally at Ohio State University in Columbus, urged thousands of students and others in attendance to register to vote \u2014 this being the last day that's possible \u2014 and to cast their ballots when they do so (Ohio allows early voting). The campaign even provided buses to take the students from the rally to registration and voting sites. Then the president ticked off a list of his accomplishments. He warned of the reversals that could occur if he's not re-elected. \"Everything that we fought for in 2008 is on the line in 2012. And I need your help to finish what we started. You know, four years ago I told you I'd end the war in Iraq and we did. I said we'd end the war in Afghanistan and we are. I said we'd focus on the people who actually attacked us on 9/11 and today Osama bin Laden is dead. Four years ago, I promised to cut taxes for middle class families and we have by $3,600. ...\" It was the kind of concise defense of his record his supporters waited in vain to hear at the first presidential debate. His attack lines on Romney were tight as well. His remarks at the rally sounded like a road test of an approach we could hear at the second presidential debate, scheduled for next week. Meanwhile, the Obama campaign dropped new ads, the artillery shells of politics, on Romney. One ad focused on Medicaid, specifically on the program's importance to families with elderly members in need of nursing-home care. The ad said that as Massachusetts governor, Romney had repeatedly raised the fees paid by families with with elderly parents in nursing homes. Another Obama ad featured the Sesame Street character Big Bird and mocked Romney for saying during the debate he would cut federal funding to the Public Broadcasting Service to help close budget deficits. Sesame Workshop asked the Obama campaign to take down the ad, but it was still on the campaign's YouTube channel after the close of business. The reverberations from last week's debate in the presidential race's dynamics, as reflected by the polls, continued to be the subject of much discussion and analysis. The bottom line seemed to be that the polls still showed a race that appeared to be tighter than before the debate, with Romney maintaining some of the bounce from his assertive performance.",

As part of Solve This, NPR's series on major issues facing the country, we're examining the presidential candidate's approach to boosting employment. After looking at President Obama's strategy, it's time to examine the plan of GOP nominee Mitt Romney. Mitt Romney says he has a plan with 59 bullet points detailing how to boost growth and job creation. He gives a short list in one of his most recent ads: \"First, my energy independence policy means more than 3 million new jobs, many of them in manufacturing. My tax reform plan to lower rates for the middle class and for small business creates 7 million more. And expanding trade, cracking down on China and improving job training takes us to over 12 million new jobs.\" That's 12 million new jobs in his first term in office. As Romney says, more than half of those jobs, 7 million, would be generated by his tax plan. One of the people behind that tax proposal is Kevin Hassett, a Romney economic adviser and senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. \"Gov. Romney's tax plan is modeled after the successful tax plans of the past, and it would generate growth because it would increase the incentive to do things that are good for America's economy and America's workers,\" Hassett says. Romney's tax plan would cut tax rates by 20 percent for all taxpayers. That would cost the Treasury almost $5 trillion in lost tax revenue over 10 years. But Romney says it won't cost $5 trillion, because he will offset the losses from lower rates by ending deductions and closing loopholes; he has not said which ones. Joel Prakken, chairman of the firm Macroeconomic Advisers, says it would be very difficult for Romney's plan to work without ending some very popular deductions \u2014 \"mortgage interest, health care benefits and the like.\" \"And so, there's some concern out there about whether it actually will be possible to engineer this kind of tax reform with such sharp cuts in marginal rates,\" Prakken says. Romney has recently suggested he might just cap taxpayers' deductions to $17,000. But some analysts say it's doubtful that would fully pay for the cost of Romney's tax cut, either. Prakken says the elimination of deductions and loopholes could lead to faster job creation in the long run, but in the short term it could eliminate jobs in industries like housing that are already struggling. \"Until we see precisely how the lower rates are going to be paid for, in terms of broadening the tax base, it's very difficult, it's just impossible, in fact, to make an unqualified statement about just how much growth we're going to get from this kind of tax initiative,\" Prakken says. As for the 12 million new jobs Romney says his policies will produce in four years, Prakken says it's not a very high bar. \"In our long-term forecast, in which we assume the continuation of current policies and an economy that's recovering toward full employment anyway, we were able to create roughly 12 million new jobs without recourse to these policies,\" Prakken adds. But Hassett, the Romney adviser, disagrees that 12 million jobs could be created under current policies. \"We've got massive deficits. We've got a corporate tax that's just out of whack with the rest of the world. We've got an enormous amount of new regulation coming in, and I think that all those things are very, very negative for growth and job creation,\" Hassett says. What about Romney's claim that he'll create 3 million new jobs in energy? Prakken says there will be significant job growth in that sector over the next 10 years, but not because of presidential policies. Rather, Prakken says, it's because the energy sector is in the midst of a boom due to the development of hydraulic fracturing, which is releasing huge quantities of U.S. gas and oil.

Lloyd Bentsen (D-Texas) shakes hands with Sen. Dan Quayle (R-Ind.) before their vice presidential debate at the Omaha Civic Auditorium in Omaha, Neb., on Oct. 5, 1988. The reviews are in and, agree with them or not, most people thought Mitt Romney bested Barack Obama in Wednesday's presidential debate. The two don't meet again until Oct. 16, but in the meantime, there will be the vice-presidential face-off this Thursday. How much pressure is riding on Vice President Joe Biden and Republican challenger Paul Ryan? Some are selling it as a potential game changer. During his \"Weekend Update\" review of last week's debate, Saturday Night Live's Seth Meyers couldn't hide his glee in anticipation of Thursday's encounter: \"Is there anything more exciting than Joe Biden thinking it's up to him to get the lead back?\" Meyers was in effect saying that Biden is likely to entertain us by providing a chuckle or gaffe, or both, as is the V.P.'s wont, and he was looking forward to it. (An unfair caricature of Biden? Perhaps. But didn't he say the other day that the middle class has been \"buried\" these past four years? He sure did, as you can see below.) Still, for all the expectation of a Biden gaffe, during his debate four years ago with Sarah Palin, there was none. His reputation for mistakes notwithstanding, he is a fierce competitor who will likely aggressively go after Ryan's proposed budget cuts and attempts to redefine Medicare, an issue on which Democrats expect to come out on top. We know less what to expect from Ryan, a policy wonk who is 27 years Biden's junior. Since the moment Ryan was chosen, conservatives have said they relish the thought of him debating Biden. We'll see on Thursday. The real question is: How much of a difference is Biden vs. Ryan expected to make? In the history of vice-presidential debates \u2014 a history that goes back only to 1976 \u2014 it's hard to make the case that they affected the outcome in any real way. Bob Dole got awful reviews for his dismissive talk of \"Democrat wars\" in his debate with Walter Mondale in 1976, and yes, the Ford-Dole ticket did lose that year. But with so many strikes against him \u2014 the Nixon pardon, the lousy economy, his own No-Soviet-Union-domination-of-Eastern-Europe gaffe during his debate with Jimmy Carter \u2014 it's too simplistic to say that President Jerry Ford owed his election defeat to Dole's nasty debate performance. And in the one V.P. debate that seemingly produced a clear winner and loser \u2014 when Lloyd Bentsen delivered his memorable \"You're no Jack Kennedy\" line to Dan Quayle in 1988 \u2014 the fact remains that the Bush-Quayle ticket carried 40 of 50 states that year. Perhaps, if Bentsen vs. Quayle took place in today's social media age, its effect might have been different. But the story in 1988, as it is in 2012, was on the top of the ticket. And there are still two more presidential debates after this week's V.P. face-off. It might be more accurate to say that some of these debates affected the individual debaters more than they did the election outcome. In any event, here's a brief summary of the history of vice presidential debates. 1976: Ford, who became president in 1974 following the resignation of Watergate-tainted Richard Nixon, was not the favorite of party conservatives; they clearly preferred Ronald Reagan. One of the things Ford did to attempt to mollify the right was the dumping of his appointed vice president, Nelson Rockefeller, and his naming of Dole as his running mate at the '76 convention. Dole's task, in his Oct. 15 debate with Mondale in Houston was to define him as a knee-jerk liberal who did the bidding of organized labor. And that's what he tried to do, at one point quipping that George Meany, the president of the AFL-CIO, was Mondale's makeup man. For his part, Mondale was equally fierce, calling Dole a captive of special interests who had no compassion for the nation's needy. But the debate was more personal and nasty than the two encounters that already had taken place between Ford and Carter. The most memorable moment was when Dole was asked his view about Ford's pardon of Nixon. Dole said it was not a very good issue, \"any more than the war in Vietnam would be, or World War II or World War I or the war in Korea \u2014 all Democrat wars, all in this century. I figured it up the other day. If we added up the killed and wounded in Democrat wars in this century, it would be about 1.6 million Americans, enough to fill the city of Detroit.\" Mondale simply replied that Dole \"has richly earned his reputation as a hatchet man tonight.\" And it stuck with Dole for the rest of his career. 1980: None. Republican candidate George H.W. Bush refused to accept Vice President Walter Mondale's offer to debate. 1984: The Oct. 11 debate in Philadelphia between Vice President Bush and Democratic challenger Geraldine Ferraro came four days after the first of two presidential face-offs between President Reagan and Mondale, a debate where most people judged Mondale to be the clear winner. But with Reagan holding such a huge lead in the polls, there was not that much pressure, or attention, placed on Bush and Ferraro. As it was, both made their cases and neither was seen as the winner or loser. Bush was determined to display his long diplomatic and foreign policy background, and he effectively defended Reagan on many subjects. Ferraro appeared less steady on some issues, but she scored with a memorable line after Bush said, \"Let me help you with the difference, Mrs. Ferraro, between Iran and the embassy in Lebanon.\" \"I almost resent,\" Ferraro immediately said, \"your patronizing attitude that you have to teach me about foreign policy.\" 1988: Clearly the most memorable V.P. debate of them all. Dan Quayle was under fire from the moment he was selected as Bush's running mate, over what he did to avoid combat during the Vietnam War and whether he was qualified to take over should something happen to Bush. Lloyd Bentsen's qualifications were not the issue \u2014 he was in his 18th year in the Senate \u2014 but he had taken many positions completely different than those by Michael Dukakis, who was atop the Democratic ticket. And he had a much-criticized plan to charge people $10,000 a plate to have breakfast with him, a plan he eventually ditched after much outcry. But it was Quayle's qualifications that dominated the debate. The Indiana senator, who had been in Congress since 1977, said at one point, \"I have as much experience in the Congress as Jack Kennedy did when he sought the presidency.\" Bentsen almost couldn't wait to respond. \"Senator, I served with Jack Kennedy,\" he said. \"I knew Jack Kennedy. Jack Kennedy was a friend of mine. Senator, you're no Jack Kennedy.\" As we later learned, his response was not spontaneous; Quayle had been comparing his tenure to that of Kennedy for some time, and the Texas senator was ready for it. But the audience went wild. 1992: The Oct. 13 debate between Vice President Quayle and Democratic challenger Al Gore in Atlanta turned into a wrestling match almost immediately, with the two candidates trying to speak over each other about President Bush's record and Bill Clinton's honesty and integrity. Quayle received high marks from conservatives for his combativeness; he came into the debate with low expectations, given his performance four years prior. Gore may not have elevated his standing but he wasn't thought to have hurt himself. For pure (inadvertent) entertainment, the appearance of Adm. James Stockdale \u2014 Ross Perot's running mate \u2014 in the debate topped them all. His opening statement \u2014 \"Who am I? Why am I here?\" \u2014 was supposed to be a lighthearted way of introducing himself to the American public. But the lines ultimately backfired on Stockdale, who seemed out of sorts and less and less involved as the debate went on. At one point, he had to ask the moderator to repeat a question because his hearing aid wasn't turned on. 1996: Republicans were chomping at the bit at the thought of taking on both President Clinton and Vice President Gore in the debates. But just as presidential challenger Bob Dole's lack of aggressive tactics failed to make him much headway, V.P. candidate Jack Kemp similarly held back from personally attacking Gore in their Oct. 9 debate in St. Petersburg, Fla. If the role of a running mate was to be the hatchet man \u2014 see Dole in '76 \u2014 Kemp had no interest in it. He was too busy playing up his eternal optimism or expressing his admiration for his opponent. And he also had to contend with questions about some of his differences with Dole. If memory serves, one of the more contentious topics was what to do about Baltimore Orioles' second baseman Roberto Alomar, who spit at an umpire. 2000: Dick Cheney had what George W. Bush lacked: strong credentials and gravitas when it came to foreign policy and national security. And those traits came in handy during the debate Cheney, a former secretary of defense, had with Joe Lieberman. The Oct. 5 debate, held on the campus of Centre College in Danville, Ky. \u2014 site of this week's Biden-Ryan debate \u2014 was civil and respectful, with both candidates often in agreement with each other. 2004: The Oct. 5 debate between Vice President Cheney and challenger John Edwards mirrored the presidential debate five days earlier, with the chief topic being the decision to invade Iraq. Edwards said the Bush administration had misled the nation into the reasons for going to war, while Cheney said the Democratic ticket couldn't be trusted on national security issues. The two argued over whether the world was safer today because of the war and the capture of Saddam Hussein. Edwards also attacked Cheney's role with Halliburton, and Cheney cited the North Carolina Democrat's seeming lack of substance as well as his \"frequent absenteeism\" from the Senate. Cheney seemed to get the better of many of their exchanges, including one about same-sex marriage (and the fact that one of Cheney's daughters is gay). 2008: The expectations game played a big role in the Oct. 2 Joe Biden-Sarah Palin debate in St. Louis. Palin had gotten savage reviews for her network TV interviews of recent weeks, in which there were clear questions about her preparedness for the job. For his part, Biden had to avoid coming across as lecturing, condescending or long-winded. Biden certainly accomplished his goal. He was subdued and respectful, and focused more on GOP presidential candidate John McCain and the outgoing Bush administration than on Palin. For her part, the Alaska governor seemed more focused on being folksy and friendly (\"Can I call you Joe?\"), though she decided at some moments to address the topics she wanted, not the ones the moderator brought up. 2012: Both Biden and Ryan have been mentioned as potential presidential candidates in 2016. Just sayin'. 2012 Debate Sked. All air from 9 to 10:30 Eastern time. Here's the rest of the schedule: Thursday, Oct. 11 \u2014 V.P. debate at Centre College in Danville, Ky.

Romney started off his campaign calling for big tax cuts, but has backed off that somewhat. Republican Mitt Romney started his campaign calling for big tax cuts, but now he has changed course. He's warning middle-class families not to raise their hopes too high. Romney couldn't have been more emphatic than he was last November at a candidates' debate in Michigan. \"What I want to do is help the people who've been hurt the most, and that's the middle class,\" he said. \"And so what I do is focus a substantial tax break on middle-income Americans.\" He put a middle-class tax cut at the top of his priority list: a 20 percent reduction in tax rates across the board. \"Right now, let's get the job done first that has to be done immediately. Let's lower the tax rates on middle-income Americans,\" he said. Then, at a debate in Tampa this January, Romney got a little more specific. \"The real question people are gonna ask is, who's going to help the American people at a time when folks are having real tough times? And that's why I've put forward a plan to eliminate the tax on savings for middle-income Americans,\" he said. \"Anyone making under $200,000 a year, I would eliminate the tax on interest, dividends and capital gains.\" Shaking Up Tax Plans But then came Romney's victory in the primaries, and a new set of goals to meet. \"Well, I think you hit a reset button for the fall campaign. Everything changes,\" campaign adviser Eric Fehrnstrom said on CNN. \"It's almost like an Etch A Sketch. You can kind of shake it up, and we start all over again.\" Romney shook up his plans on the tax cuts. He still wanted to lower the tax rates, but now he was more emphatic about the need for tax changes to be revenue-neutral. In September, he had words of caution for the crowd that filled the gym at a suburban Ohio high school. \"By the way, don't be expecting a huge cut in taxes, because I'm also going to lower deductions and exemptions,\" he said. In other words, your tax rate might be lower, but your taxable income might be higher. He elaborated in the Wednesday night debate with President Obama. \"I will not, under any circumstances, raise taxes on middle-income families. I will lower taxes on middle-income families,\" he said. But he avoided details. He said he would work with Congress, and he quickly moved to talk about another goal: lowering the tax rate for small-business people. \"If we lower that rate, they will be able to hire more people. For me, this is about jobs,\" he said. Will The Tax Cut Stick? As the campaign goes on, Romney gives the tax cuts more and more to do: Help the middle class, produce more jobs, keep the same amount of money flowing into the government, and more. At the conservative think tank American Enterprise Institute, research fellow Michael Strain says Romney has plenty of tax variables he can adjust. \"There are a lot of different levers to pull here. You have the marginal tax rates, you have the amount of income that's subject to taxation, you have the amount of income that you can deduct from your gross income to calculate your taxable income,\" Strain says. Is a middle-class tax cut possible with everything else? Strain thinks it is. \"In order to do that, you would have to have a specific plan. And we haven't seen that from Gov. Romney yet,\" he says. But at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, co-director William Gale says Romney is caught in a bind. \"He has made a set of proposals that are jointly impossible to fulfill. And so something has to give,\" he says. It may be that what's giving \u2014 as Romney told the crowd in Ohio \u2014 is the middle-class tax cut.",

This week, we answer inquiries about the candidates' policies on housing and taxes. A for-sale sign hangs in front of a Homestead, Fla., home. In terms of the housing market, the presidential candidates differ most on regulation.\n                \n                    \n                    J. Pat Carter/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption A for-sale sign hangs in front of a Homestead, Fla., home. In terms of the housing market, the presidential candidates differ most on regulation. On paper, President Obama and Gov. Mitt Romney's policy prescriptions are pretty similar. The one major difference is a question of financial regulation. The president is a strong supporter of the Dodd-Frank financial regulations, which include a lot of strong consumer protections for homebuyers. Romney wants to roll back some of those regulations, but he hasn't specified which parts. Question from Mark Copeland of Chicago, Ill.: \"In the presidential debate Wednesday, Romney said, 'I will eliminate all programs by this test, if they don't pass it: Is the program so critical it's worth borrowing money from China to pay for it? And if not, I'll get rid of it.' Under this litmus test, which federal housing programs will [Romney] eliminate?\" Answer from NPR's Yuki Noguchi: \"Currently, there are several housing programs. There's HARP, which is the refinancing program, and HAMP, the mortgage-modification program, and then the Obama administration also backs plans that allow homeowners to refinance even if they're under water, which is to say that they owe more on their home than it's now worth. And they also support some forms of loan forgiveness. \"Mr. Romney's campaign has not been specific about which of those programs he'll keep or which he may scrap. Last year, he said in an interview that he believes the foreclosure market should be allowed to hit bottom so that private capital can come in. And many people heard that and thought this was sort of critical of all government intervention designed to prevent foreclosure. \"The campaign has backed away from that, and they told me recently that they do support some forms of foreclosure alternatives, although, again, no specifics about which of those alternatives they prefer. .... But they also say the overriding fix for housing has more to do with improving the economy and the jobs picture.\" We'll be covering a number of issues leading up to Election Day. Submit your questions to ReporterHotline@npr.org.More From This Series Question from Darren Thiesen of Rathdrum, Idaho: \"I do have questions if Romney ever does plan to, before the election, actually come up with specific loopholes, specific things that he would like to cut.\" Answer from NPR's Scott Horsley: \"Gov. Romney has been vague about the loopholes he would close in order to offset the lost revenue from lowering tax rates. So in the absence of those details, fiscal analysts have had to do some guesswork. One independent study that President Obama often sites looked at what high-income people would save if their marginal tax rate were lowered by 20 percent, and then looked at all the tax breaks high-income people currently get. [The study] concluded, even if you took away all their tax breaks, the rich would still end up paying less. Now, that's assuming you didn't do away with tax breaks for savings and investment. \"But if you did that, and the rich paid less, then the only way to keep government revenues steady, as Gov. Romney said he wants to do, would be for middle-class families to pay more. The governor argued that if that's how the numbers worked out, he'd simply change his plan to make sure the deficit doesn't go up and that the relative tax burden on the wealthy doesn't go down. \"President Obama starts by saying he wants to make the tax code more progressive \u2014 that means the share of tax burden paid by the wealthy would increase. Beyond that, he says he's open to reforming the tax code, lowering rates and doing away with loopholes, which everyone says would make it more efficient. But he doesn't start with a goal of cutting rates by 20 percent.\" Question from Ian Gard, commenting on NPR.org: \"Now we are in this situation with way too many loopholes. Assuming that we fix this, though, what is to prevent Congress from doing this again?\" Answer from Horsley: \"The thing is, if you want to encourage some kind of behavior, whether it's going to college or buying a home or building a factory, both Democrats and Republicans have found it a lot easier to sell that program as a tax break than, say, a direct government grant \u2014 even though, from an economic point of view, it's pretty much the same. So, over the last few decades, the tax code has become the vehicle for a whole lot of government policy. Some of that policy, perhaps, very worthwhile, but it's made for a very inefficient tax system.\" Question from Bill Shipley of Chicago: \"I'd like to know what the candidates' positions are on raising the income cap on payroll taxes, given that these are the primary source of funding for Social Security and Medicare.\" Answer from Horsley: \"It's an interesting question, you know, because our income tax system is somewhat progressive, but payroll taxes for Social Security are flat to regressive \u2014 you pay the same rate on every dollar of income, up to about $110,000. And beyond that, you pay nothing. There's no such cap on the portion of the payroll tax that goes for Medicare, by the way. \"I'm not aware that President Obama's addressed this idea specifically, though I suspect it's something he might be open to. He did rely on an extra payroll tax of about 1 percent for the wealthy to help fund his health care plan. That only kicks in at the $200,000 level \u2014 not $110, 000 \u2014 because, of course, he promised back in 2008 not to raise taxes on anyone making less than $200,000.\"",

One of Obama's closest advisers acknowledges the president will \"have to adjust\" his approach to future debates.  RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: After that debate performance that dismayed many Democrats, President Obama's campaign is accusing Romney of having a sudden makeover. Mr. Obama delivered that message yesterday at post-debate rallies in Colorado and Wisconsin. NPR's Scott Horsley reports. UNIDENTIFIED GROUP: (Chanting) Four more years, four more years, four more years. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: One way to get beyond a lackluster debate performance is to surround yourself with adoring fans, and President Obama did just that yesterday, addressing 30,000 supporters in Madison, Wisconsin - his biggest rally of the year. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) HORSLEY: The president quickly tried to undermine the winning persona that Governor Romney showcased in the debate, arguing the moderate man he found himself sharing the stage with Wednesday bears little resemblance to the severe conservative who emerged from the Republican primaries. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) HORSLEY: The president and his aides insist Governor Romney has not really abandoned his plans to cut taxes to the rich or roll back regulations. He's just stopped talking about policies that aren't very popular. Mr. Obama promised to hold Romney accountable for the positions he's taken throughout the campaign. If you want to be president, he said, you owe the American people the truth. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) HORSLEY: But if the president seemed eager to challenge his Republican rival yesterday in front of 30,000 people in Madison, why not Wednesday night before a TV audience of nearly 70 million? Aides say Mr. Obama decided ahead of time not to engage in serial fact-checking during the debate for fear it would never end. But political advisor David Plouffe says it could be different the next time the two men meet. DAVID PLOUFFE: We are going to have to adjust going forward, simply because it's clear that Romney will try and say anything to get a political advantage in the moment. We're going to make sure people understand what he will do as president. Those cuts in education, the vouchers for Medicare, the huge tax cuts for the wealthy paid for by the middle class for exploding the deficit - this is what he's going to do. HORSLEY: The plan to replace Medicare with a voucher for future retirees is one policy Governor Romney did not back away from during the debate. Mr. Obama promises to keep reminding voters of that difference. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) HORSLEY: Mr. Obama complained during and after the debate about the lack of specifics from Governor Romney. His plan for deficit reduction, for example, relies entirely on spending cuts. But the other concrete cut Romney identified Wednesday was federal funding for public television. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) HORSLEY: Mr. Obama's supporters were glad to see his feisty campaign side reemerge. Daniella Moody admits she was disappointed by the president's performance during the debate. DANIELLA MOODY: I think he wasn't as prepared as he could have been. He wasn't on top of his A game. HORSLEY: But the University of Wisconsin senior says even if Mr. Obama lost the debate, it won't change her vote in November. MOODY: No, I won't vote for Romney. Not at all. I'll support Obama till the end. HORSLEY: That's not surprising in this liberal college town. Both the president and Governor Romney will be watching closely to see if Wednesday's faceoff and the coverage that follows moves swing voters elsewhere in the battleground. Scott Horsley, NPR News.

            "article_content": "President Obama and GOP rival Mitt Romney shared a stage for the first time in the presidential campaign Wednesday night. In a 90-minute debate, moderated by PBS's Jim Lehrer, Romney aggressively challenged the president on his record. The president defended his economic policies and challenged Romney to show that his plans wouldn't hurt the middle class.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: It's MORNING EDITION from NPR News. I'm Steve Inskeep. RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: And I'm Renee Montagne. Good morning. President Obama and his Republican challenger, Mitt Romney, shared a stage last night for the first time in his presidential campaign. The debate in Denver, moderated by PBS anchor Jim Lehrer, focused on domestic policy, which meant there was lots to debate, from health care to energy, though much of the time was devoted to taxes. NPR's national political correspondent Mara Liasson reports. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Because Romney is trailing the president in the polls, he had a longer to-do list for the debate, and last night he wasted no time checking off his goals. First up, humanize himself. In his opening statement, Romney told anecdotes from the campaign trail to show that he wasn't a heartless rich guy who dismissed 47 percent of Americans as dependent on government handouts. (SOUNDBITE OF DEBATE) MITT ROMNEY: I was in Dayton, Ohio, and a woman grabbed my arm, and she said, I've been out of work since May. Can you help me? Ann yesterday was at a rally in Denver, and a woman came up to her with a baby in her arms and said, Ann, my husband has had four jobs in three years, part-time jobs. He's lost his most recent job, and we've now just lost our home. Can you help us? And the answer is yes, we can help, but it's going to take a different path, not the one we've been on. LIASSON: A path, Romney said, that had devastated small businesses in America. (SOUNDBITE OF DEBATE) ROMNEY: I know what it takes to get small business growing again, to hire people. Now, I'm concerned that the path that we're on has just been unsuccessful. The president has a view very similar to the view he had when he ran four years ago, that a bigger government, spending more, taxing more, regulating more, - if you will, trickle-down government - would work. That's not the right answer for America. I'll restore the vitality that gets America working again. LIASSON: President Obama and Governor Romney clashed repeatedly over taxes, with the president charging that Romney's proposed tax cuts for the wealthy will have to be paid for by raising  taxes or cutting  programs for the middle class. (SOUNDBITE OF DEBATE) PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Governor Romney's proposal that he has been promoting for 18 months calls for a $5 trillion tax cut on top of $2 trillion of additional spending for our military. And he is saying that he is going to pay for it by closing loopholes and deductions. The problem is that he's been asked over a hundred times how you would close those deductions and loopholes and he hasn't been able to identify them. But I'm going to make an important point here, Jim. When you add up all the loopholes and deductions that upper income individuals can - are currently taking advantage of - you take those all away \u2014 you don't come close to paying for $5 trillion in tax cuts and $2 trillion in additional military spending. And that's why independent studies looking at this said the only way to meet Governor Romney's pledge of not reducing the deficit, or not adding to the deficit, is by burdening middle class families. The average middle class family with children would pay about $2,000 more. Now, that's not my analysis; that's the analysis of economists who have looked at this. And that kind of top-down economics, where folks at the top are doing well so the average person making three million bucks is getting a $250,000 tax break while middle class families are burdened further, that's not what I believe is a recipe for economic growth. JIM LEHRER: What is the difference? ROMNEY: Virtually everything he just said about my tax plan is inaccurate. LEHRER: All right. ROMNEY: So if - if the tax plan he described were a tax plan I was asked to support, I'd say absolutely not. I'm not looking for a $5 trillion tax cut. What I've said is I won't put in place a tax cut that adds to the deficit. That's part one. So there's no economist can say Mitt Romney's tax plan adds five trillion if I say I will not add to the deficit with my tax plan. Number two, I will not reduce the share paid by high-income individuals. I know that you and your running mate keep saying that, and I know it's a popular things to say with a lot of people, but it's just not the case. Look, I've got five boys. I'm used to people saying something that's not always true but just keep on repeating it and ultimately hoping I'll believe it. But that is not the case, all right? I will not reduce the taxes paid by high-income Americans. And number three, I will not, under any circumstances, raise taxes on middle income families. LIASSON: Romney and the president were asked to explain their different approaches to cutting the deficit. The president said his plan was balanced, Romney's was not. (SOUNDBITE OF DEBATE) OBAMA: You know, when Governor Romney stood on a stage with other Republican candidates for the nomination, and he was asked, would you take $10 of spending cuts for just $1 of revenue, and he said no. Now, if you take such an unbalanced approach, then that means you are going to be gutting our investments in schools and education. It means that Governor Romney talked about Medicaid and how we could send it back to the states, but effectively this means a 30 percent cut in the primary program we help for seniors who are in nursing homes, for kids who are with disabilities... LEHRER: Mr. President, I'm sorry... OBAMA: ...and that is not a right strategy for us to move forward. LIASSON: Romney responded with another attack on the president's record. (SOUNDBITE OF DEBATE) ROMNEY: You've been president four years. You said you'd cut the deficit in half. It's now four years later. We still have trillion dollar deficits. LIASSON: Beyond softening his own image and roughing up the incumbent's, Romney also wanted to come across as a reasonable alternative to the president. He repeated his pledge to replace Obamacare but promised to retain the most popular elements of it. He said he wanted to repeal the Dodd-Frank bank regulation law but promised to keep many of its reforms too. Asked how he would govern at a time of partisan gridlock, Romney presented himself as a moderate bridge builder, not the severe conservative he said he was during the primaries. (SOUNDBITE OF DEBATE) ROMNEY: The day after I get elected, I'll sit down with leaders - the Democratic leaders as well as Republican leaders and - as we did in my state. We met every Monday for a couple of hours, talked about the issues and the challenges in our state in that case. We have to work on a collaborative basis, not because we're going to compromise our principle, but because there's common ground and the challenges America faces right now. Look, the reason I'm in this race is there are people that are really hurting today in this country and we face - this deficit could crush the future generations. What's happening in the Middle East - there are developments around the world that are of real concern. And Republicans and Democrats both love America, but we need to have leadership, leadership in Washington that will actually bring people together and get the job done and could not care less if it's a Republican or a Democrat. I've done it before. I'll do it again. LEHRER: Mr. President. OBAMA: First of all, I think Governor Romney's going to have a busy first day because he's also going to repeal Obamacare, which will not be very popular among Democrats as you're sitting down with them. LIASSON: And, Mr. Obama said, being a leader means having a plan and being able to explain what it is. (SOUNDBITE OF DEBATE) OBAMA: What's important is occasionally you got to say no to folks both in your own party and in the other party. And you know, yes, have we had some fights between me and the Republicans when they fought back against us, reining in the excesses of Wall Street? Absolutely, because that was a fight that needed to be had. When we were fighting about whether or not we were going to make sure that Americans had more security with their health insurance and they said no - yes, that was a fight that we needed to have. And so part of leadership and governing is both saying what it that you are for but also being willing to say no to some things. And I've got to tell you, Governor Romney, when it comes to his own party during the course of this campaign, has not displayed that willingness to say no to some of the more extreme parts of his party. LIASSON: During the debate, Romney seemed more energetic and forceful, and he looked like he was enjoying himself more. The president, by contrast, was less crisp and animated, and he often failed to pursue his own usual lines of attack. He never mentioned Romney's 47 percent comments, his career at Bain Capital, his tax returns, or his positions on immigration or abortion. Last night the instant polls of viewers and the expert analysis produced a consensus that Romney had, quote, \"won\" the debate. But it won't be clear for several days what impact that will have on the race. Governor Romney and President Obama still have two more chances to debate, at a town hall meeting with voters in New York and a foreign policy debate in Florida. Mara Liasson, NPR News, Denver.

Mitt Romney may have given his campaign something of a reset with his performance in the first debate against President Obama. He appeared more comfortable on stage than the incumbent, and was able at least to lay the groundwork for a message of bipartisanship that could appeal to remaining undecided voters. Of course, it's not clear yet whether the debate will create enough momentum to offer Romney an advantage heading into the next debate, let alone through Election Day. Perhaps some of the inevitable post-debate fact checking will challenge Romney's credence on certain points. But it's notable that Obama failed to do much of that himself, launching far fewer attacks during the debate than his aggressive campaign advertising strategy suggested he might. Here's a quick review of five takeaways from the first debate in Denver: Obama Looked Tired And Sounded Defensive Obama's advisers noted before the debate that the president was having a hard time finding much unbroken debate practice time, and much of what he did have was devoted to boiling down his positions to fit the time limits. All of this showed. Romney looked straight at his opponent, often wearing a confident Mona Lisa grin. Obama looked down at his notes or over at the moderator, Jim Lehrer of PBS, only occasionally looking directly into the camera. Aside from his body language, some of Obama's answers came across as wonky. Both men offered laundry lists of their ideas, but Obama failed to craft a compelling case for his own record or second-term agenda, instead repeating complaints that he had inherited a mess. What's more, he failed to go after Romney aggressively. There was no mention of Bain Capital or Romney's dismissive videotaped comments about the \"47 percent\" of Americans who are dependent on government. Only in the last 20 minutes of the 90-minute debate did Obama land much of a blow, complaining that Romney was keeping the specifics about his tax plans and his approaches to health care and banking regulation too much a secret. Romney Grasped The Mantle Of Bipartisanship Romney said he didn't want to lay out anything other than broad principles during the campaign, because he found out as Massachusetts governor that a \"my way or the highway\" approach doesn't win over legislators. Even before Lehrer had made \"partisan gridlock\" the subject of his final question, Romney stressed the importance of bipartisanship. He said that something as important as the federal health care law should have been passed on a bipartisan basis (it received essentially no GOP support) and paid homage to the working relationship of Republican President Ronald Reagan and Democratic House Speaker Tip O'Neill in the 1980s. \"I had the great experience \u2014 it didn't seem like it at the time \u2014 of being elected in a state where my legislature was 87 percent Democrat,\" Romney said, \"and that meant I figured out from day one I had to get along and I had to work across the aisle to get anything done.\" Given consistent Republican opposition to Obama in Congress \u2014 some have called it obstructionism \u2014 no doubt Democrats will question the sincerity of Romney's embrace of bipartisanship. But it's a message that could be welcomed by voters, particularly centrist independents. You're A Drinking Game Winner If You're Middle Class Both candidates were at pains to pay tribute to members of the middle class, again and again. Each referred to specific members of the middle class they had met along the campaign trail, who had gone back to school or were now out of work. Each insisted his plan would do more to help such people out and create middle-class jobs. Obama argued that Romney's plans to cut taxes and increase military spending would necessarily cause the deficit to balloon or \"burden\" the middle class, because there would not be sufficient savings available to offset their cost by ending deductions or closing loopholes. Romney insisted that his tax-cut plan would impose no such hardship. \"I will not, under any circumstances, raise taxes on middle-income families,\" he said. When Candidates Have The Microphone, They'll Keep Talking Romney sought to refute a study Obama had cited to show his tax package would hurt the middle class was wrong: \"There are six other studies that looked at the study you describe and say it's completely wrong,\" Romney said. Many of the candidate's responses were like that: Sometimes arcane, often straying from the original question that Lehrer had asked. At one point, Romney used an education question to repeat a charge that Obama had squandered billions on unsuccessful green-energy programs. Nearly all politicians use debate questions merely as jumping-off points, concerning themselves with highlighting policies they deem most important. Both men did that Wednesday, ignoring Lehrer's frequent invitations to confront or question their opponent directly, in favor of rattling off other arguments of their own. Partly as a result, the debate's intended format, of 15-minute segments each covering six different topics, was broken almost immediately, leaving only three minutes for the final segment. Lehrer struggled unsuccessfully to cut off the two candidates and redirect them to the supposed topic at hand. A stammering Twitter handle called @SilentJimLehrer went up during the debate, quickly attracting thousands of followers. Democrats Will Want To Retool For Future Debates For all his oratorical gifts, Obama has sometimes struggled in debates. He was often out-mastered during the long series of debates during the Democratic primary season in 2008 and hasn't had much practice since then \u2014 except for his debates against Sen. John McCain in 2008. Republicans, meanwhile, have been nearly salivating for months at the prospect of the vice presidential debate, which takes place on Oct. 11. They believe Romney's running mate, Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, has the intellectual and rhetorical firepower to wipe the floor with Vice President Joe Biden. That may prove to be wishful thinking. Ryan has put many of his own ideas on ice while serving as the loyal No. 2, while Biden is deeply versed in both domestic and foreign policy. But Obama's lackluster performance \u2014 coupled with Biden's remark Tuesday that \"the middle class ...has been buried the last four years\" \u2014 will leave GOP partisans giddy with anticipation of next Thursday's debate.",

            "article_content": "In their first of three debates, President Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney \"traded barbs\" and stretched some facts, say the nonpartisan watchdogs at PolitiFact.com. Similarly, the researchers at the Annenberg Public Policy Center's FactCheck.org found examples of truth-stretching by both men. Overall, it was a debate packed with facts, a wonk's delight. From the very first remarks, with President Obama saying 5 million jobs have been created in the private sector over the last 30 months, the debate was very number focused. So there were some things to check. And because Romney made more factual assertions, he's getting dinged more \u2014 at least in the early hours after the debate \u2014 by the fact checkers. Here is a sample of what's being reported about the truthiness of what Obama and Romney had to say Wednesday night on stage at the University of Denver: -- One of the biggest disputes was over tax cuts. Obama argued that Romney's plan to stimulate the economy includes a tax cut totaling $5 trillion that, Obama said, isn't possible because the Republican nominee is also promising to spend money in other places. Romney flatly disputed that number. \"First of all, I don't have a $5 trillion tax cut,\" he said. Who's right? The Washington Post's Fact Checker says the facts on this one are on Obama's side. The New York Times notes that Romney \"has proposed cutting all marginal tax rates by 20 percent \u2014 which would in and of itself cut tax revenue by $5 trillion.\" FactCheck.org has weighed in too, tweeting during the debate that \"Romney says he will pay for $5T tax cut without raising deficit or raising taxes on middle class. Experts say that's not possible.\" PolitiFact has given a \"mostly true\" rating to the charge that \"Romney is proposing a tax plan \"that would give millionaires another tax break and raise taxes on middle class families by up to $2,000 a year.\" -- Has the president put in place a plan that would cut Medicare benefits by $716 billion? Romney says yes. The president says no. According to PolitiFact, Romney's charge is \"half true.\" \"That amount \u2014 $716 billion \u2014 refers to Obamacare's reductions in Medicare spending over 10 years, primarily paid to insurers and hospitals,\" says PolitiFact. So there is a basis for the number. But, it adds, \"the statement gives the impression that the law takes money already allocated to Medicare away from current recipients,\" which is why it gets only a \"half true\" rating. The New York Times writes that Obama \"did not cut benefits by $716 billion over 10 years as part of his 2010 health care law; rather, he reduced Medicare reimbursements to health care providers, chiefly insurance companies and drug manufacturers. And the law gave Medicare recipients more generous benefits for prescription drugs and free preventive care like mammograms.\" Still, as NPR's Julie Rovner has reported, \"some of the money does indeed reduce future Medical spending, and the fact is, you can't reduce health care spending and preserve Medicare for 78 million baby boomers without slowing its growth.\" -- In listing his objections to the Affordable Care Act, Romney said it \"puts in place an unelected board that's going to tell people, ultimately, what kind of treatments they can have. I don't like that idea.\" But the Times and National Journal have reported that the board in question wouldn't make treatment decisions, a point Obama made during the debate. National Journal called Romney's characterization of what this board would do \"one of the biggest whoppers of the night.\" PolitiFact gave Romney's claim a \"mostly false\" rating. Under the law, the board's job would be to keep Medicare spending within a particular target (not a dollar figure, but as a factor of GDP) but the board is prohibited from choosing the benefits to be restricted to achieve savings, so it cannot make treatment decisions. FactCheck.org, which has likened the charge about this panel to the earlier claim from Republicans that Obama would create \"death panels,\" writes that \"the board, the Independent Payment Advisory Board, cannot, by law, 'ration' care or determine which treatments Medicare covers. In fact, the IPAB is limited in what it can do to curb the growth of Medicare spending.\" -- On cutting the federal deficit, PolitiFact writes, \"Romney claimed that Obama had said he would 'cut the deficit in half.' That's the case. ... Obama said he put forward 'a specific $4 trillion deficit reduction plan.' That's true if you combine the 10-year impact of his budget with the 10-year impact of cuts already approved. (For that reason, we've previously found his claim that his budget plan would 'cut our deficits by $4 trillion' Half True.)\" -- As for Obama's claim that under his watch the economy has created 5 million jobs in the past 30 months, NPR's John Ydstie says that's true. But it also ignores an inconvenient truth (for the president), that about the same number of jobs were lost during Obama's first year in office. -- And on a lighter note, the debate opened with a tender moment and a fact that soon was disputed on Twitter. In acknowledging his wedding anniversary, Obama said that \"20 years ago I became the luckiest man on Earth because Michelle Obama agreed to marry me.\" An astute tweeter noted that 20 years ago, the first lady's last name was Robinson.",

Here's how what they said matches up with our economist-approved presidential platform: Eliminate certain deductions: The word \"deductions\" was used 14 times in last night's debate, but neither candidate specifically mentioned the mortgage interest deduction or the deduction companies get for providing health-care to employees. Mitt Romney talked about limiting, but not totally eliminating, deductions. He said: \"...What are the various ways we could bring down deductions, for instance? One way, for instance, would be to have a single number. Make up a number \u2014 25,000 (dollars), $50,000. Anybody can have deductions up to that amount. And then that number disappears for high-income people. That's one way one could do it.\" Eliminate the corporate tax: Though both candidates expressed interest in lowering the corporate income tax, neither said they want to get rid of it entirely. President Obama said: \"When it comes to our tax code, Governor Romney and I both agree that our corporate tax rate is too high. So I want to lower it, particularly for manufacturing, taking it down to 25 percent.\" Eliminate income and payroll taxes: Our plan, crafted by six economists, supports eliminating all income and payroll taxes. No one on stage last night suggested this, though both candidates said they want to bring down the tax rate for the middle class. Romney said: \"I will not, under any circumstances, raise taxes on middle-income families. I will lower taxes on middle-income families.\" President Obama said: \"I believe that the economy works best when middle-class families are getting tax breaks...\" Introduce a carbon tax: A carbon tax was never mentioned last night. But President Obama did say: \"... Oil and natural gas production are higher than they've been in years. I also believe that we've got to look at the energy source of the future, like wind and solar and biofuels, and make those investments.\" Romney said he wants to increase production of oil and gas in the U.S.: \"...your administration has cut the number of permits and license in half. If I'm president, I'll double them. And also get the \u2014 the oil from offshore and Alaska. And I'll bring that pipeline in from Canada.\" Legalize marijuana: Neither candidate talked about drugs or the economic benefits of making marijuana legal.

            "article_content": "President Obama and Mitt Romney both have plans to rebuild America's economy. They talk about them on the stump every day, but they sound surprisingly similar for two men who disagree about so much.  AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: And you can listen to tonight's debate live on many NPR stations. We'll also have analysis and fact checking at NPR.org. Now, our next story looks not at the differences between the candidates, which we're sure to hear about tonight, but at a similarity. President Obama and Mitt Romney share something that goes to the core of this campaign. As NPR's Ari Shapiro reports, it comes up in every stump speech they give. ARI SHAPIRO, BYLINE: The central issue in this campaign is the economy and each candidate's plan to fix it. Barak Obama and Mitt Romney both have roadmaps and if you listen to those prescriptions side by side, they sound remarkably alike, starting with a basic number. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: I'm putting forward a practical five-point plan to create jobs. MITT ROMNEY: Now, my plan, as you've heard, has five key steps. OBAMA: Practical, specific five-point plan. ROMNEY: I have five things I'm going to do. SHAPIRO: Romney boiled down his five-point plan from a much longer proposal that he unveiled in Nevada a year ago. ROMNEY: This is not just one silver bullet. There's not just one idea in here. There are 59 of them. SHAPIRO: That seemed a bit unwieldy. Herman Cain gave Romney some flak for the proposal during a primary debate in New Hampshire. HERMAN CAIN: Can you name all 59 points in your 160-page plan? SHAPIRO: By the general election, 59 shrank down to five. The Obama campaign unveiled the president's five-point plan later at his party's convention. And by the time he hit the campaign trail in Florida the following weekend, the five-point plan was rolling with him on the bus tour. OBAMA: I'm asking you to rally not around me, but rally around a set of goals for our country in manufacturing and education and energy, national security, reducing the deficit. MARY KATE CARY: The rule amongst speechwriters is you always use an odd number. SHAPIRO: Mary Kate Cary was a speechwriter for the first President Bush. She says a three-point plan can be good for the small stuff. CARY: You'd see three for, like, you know, three ways I'm going to increase community service in the United States, something like that. Five would be better for something big like the economy. SHAPIRO: Dig into the substance of the candidates' five-point plans and the similarities get really uncanny. Here's goal number one. OBAMA: First, I want to export more products and outsource fewer jobs. ROMNEY: Where other nations are now competing, I want to make sure our goods can go throughout the world. SHAPIRO: Both men want to sell more American products overseas. Next on the list... ROMNEY: I'm going to take advantage of our energy resources and get us energy independent. OBAMA: Second part of the plan is to control more of our own energy. SHAPIRO: And the similarities don't stop there. Here's number three. ROMNEY: Number three, I'm going to make sure we have the kind of training programs that give people the skills they need for the jobs of today. OBAMA: Number three, I want to give more Americans the chance to get the skills that they need to compete. SHAPIRO: Remember, these are the stump speeches that the candidates give nearly every day. The five things that are, as Romney puts it... ROMNEY: Dramatically different than the path of status quo represented by this president. SHAPIRO: Each candidate says this is what distinguishes him from his opponent. But so far, the five-points line up three for three. Let's see what's behind door number four. ROMNEY: Fourth, we have got to cut the deficit. OBAMA: Number four, I want to reduce the deficit without sticking it to the middle class. SHAPIRO: For both candidates, number four is shrinking the deficit. On number five, they finally diverge. Romney talks about small businesses and the president talks about national security. Still, alignment on four out of five points is kind of amazing, says former Clinton speechwriter Jeff Shesol. JEFF SHESOL: One of the things that's striking in our historical moment is the degree of consensus in this country about the big issues. Everybody wants, it seems, to protect the middle class. Everybody wants to find a path to energy independence. Everybody wants to reduce the deficit. But the real battle is going to be waged over the question of how we get there. SHAPIRO: And indeed, there are profound differences beneath the bullet points. Take energy independence. Both men want to stop relying on Mideast oil, but Romney wants the Environmental Protection Agency to stop meddling in U.S. coal mines. ROMNEY: And I am going to bring that pipeline in from Canada so we can get their oil. SHAPIRO: On energy independence, President Obama talks about fuel efficiency and green energy. OBAMA: We've doubled the amount of renewable energy that we generate from things like wind and solar. SHAPIRO: And the disagreements extend into the rest of the five-points as well. Tonight in Denver, those disagreements over how to solve the nation's problems will play out on the debate stage. But at least the candidates agree on what the most pressing problems are.

The Children's Hospital Association distributed a trading card with her picture and details of her case to lobby against Medicaid cuts. Medicaid is already the nation's largest health insurance program in terms of number of people covered: It serves nearly 1 in 5 Americans. Yet at the same time it's putting increasing strain on the budgets of states, which pay about 40 percent of its costs. If the 2010 health law proceeds as planned, Medicaid could see as many as 11 million more people added to its rolls over the next decade. The prospect of expansion thrills health insurance advocates, but it terrifies those who fear Medicaid is a substandard way to deliver care. So Medicaid is likely to undergo a major change regardless of whether President Obama is re-elected or replaced by Republican Mitt Romney. Democrats support a much bigger program. Republicans have plans to scale it back. But first, a little bit about the program. When most people think of Medicaid, they think of moms and kids on welfare. And it's true, moms and kids who get welfare do also generally get Medicaid health coverage. In fact, working-age adults and children make up about 75 percent of Medicaid's population. But they're responsible for only one-third of its costs. \"Two-thirds of the dollars that are spent on Medicaid are spent on elderly and disabled people, many of whom have multiple challenges and a good number of whom are either in nursing homes or are disabled people who also receive Medicare,\" says Harold Pollack, a professor of public health at the University of Chicago. And while Medicaid is the health program for the poorest of the poor, it also serves millions of people who are \"medically needy\" \u2014 those whose extreme health needs aren't met by their private insurance. That includes people like Marty and Shannon Svikhart of Baltimore, and their 3- year-old daughter Simone. The Svikharts were on Capitol Hill last week to urge Congress not to cut Medicaid funding. Simone was born prematurely. And, despite a huge smile and a headful of blonde hair, she still suffers from a long list of ailments. Her mom says they include \"cystic fibrosis... hydrocephalus, a brain bleed. Right now, she also has high blood pressure. Eventually she will have to have open heart surgery.\" Shannon quit her job as a dietician to care for Simone full time. Marty is an account manager for a firm that makes patio decking, and they have good health insurance. But it's not enough. Because Simone still needs to be on a ventilator at night, she needs a night nurse, and the family's private insurance will only pay for 90 days of coverage each year for that. \"If we had to pay out of pocket for home nursing, that would average about $140,000 per year,\" Marty says. That, he says, would be \"financially unmanageable, unless we hit the lottery or something.\" Under a special program, however, that only accepts 200 children with complex health needs at a time, Maryland's Medicaid helps pay the family's night nursing costs. Shannon Svikhart says it's made a huge difference. \"That means that Marty and I can sleep. Marty travels; so if we didn't have that he would have had to quit his job, probably work locally.\" And without the night nursing coverage, Simone would likely have had to remain in the hospital, where her care would be even more expensive. So having the Medicaid help, Marty says, \"helps get the children out of the hospital faster, which lessens the cost overall for the health care system, insurance, and everyone.\" But Medicaid critics say while programs like that may be useful, the program overall is still way too expensive. \"For many states it's the biggest item in their budget. They're all struggling to figure out what to do,\" said Grace Marie Turner. She's a conservative health policy analyst and was a member of the Bush Administration's Medicaid Commission in 2005. Turner says one of the biggest problems is the amount of micromanaging of Medicaid that comes from Washington. \"You wind up with all of this red tape and bureaucracy and it's costly and in my opinion we wind up with a program that provides the worst care to the most vulnerable people,\" she said. Candidate Romney says he would solve the problem basically by ending Medicaid's status as a shared federal-state program. He would instead turn the money back to the states in the form of block grants and let them craft their own programs. But he'd also make his Medicaid plan a money-saver, by capping what the federal government provides at the cost-of-living plus one percent. That's well below medical inflation, he told 60 Minutes last month. \"That's a lower rate of growth than we've seen over the past several years, a lower rate of growth than has been forecast under federal management. And I believe on that basis you're going to see us save about a hundred billion dollars a year.\" Conservatives insist states can run their programs more efficiently without cutting people or services. Liberals are far more skeptical. \"To me it is a very significant gamble that if you really cut the payments to states, that states will somehow be able to find ways to cut money,\" said Pollack of the University of Chicago. \"Right now, Medicaid pays very low rates to providers, its costs per person have actually been going up slower than just about anyplace else in the healthcare system.\" By contrast, President Obama's Affordable Care Act originally required states to expand Medicaid to most non-disabled adults with incomes under 133 percent of poverty. That's about $15,000 for an individual. And it will help more than just those people actually getting insurance for the first time, Pollack says. \"It also allows the people who are taking care of that individual to get reliable payment, which is a really important issue for public hospitals and for many other organizations that just desperately need that support right now,\" he explains. But the Supreme Court this summer made that Medicaid expansion optional for the states. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius thinks eventually most states will opt in, if only because the federal government will pay nearly all the costs. \"We think at the end of the day this is a deal that states won't want to turn down,\" she said at George Washington University this summer. But as with few other programs, the fate of Medicaid will be very different depending on who the next president is.",

Housing continues to be a big issue for the economy, and for many voters. But so far it hasn't been a major issue in the presidential campaign. Perhaps that's because both sides agree that there's no easy fix for the problem of millions of troubled mortgages. The Problem: Cathy Busby and her husband co-owned a realty office in Denver when they bought their house in 2006. The next year, the market for houses dried up, leaving them with little income as their house lost value. Now, she says, she considers herself \"poverty level.\" The presidential debates come to Busby's hometown Wednesday. And she says she's just one of many voters in swing states who want better housing solutions out of Washington. She says her lender offered three separate loan modifications, only to rescind each one, even though she says she signed and paid everything required. Busby says she and her husband also spent countless hours trying to help some 50 other Denver families negotiate with banks to get their mortgages modified. Not one of those attempts was successful. \"I'll tell you what I learned,\" she says. \"It doesn't make any difference what you do. These banks never had any intentions of really modifying loans.\" Now, some banks did modify loans and can prove it, but lots of people share Busby's view that as an industry, there wasn't much of an effort. Obama's Approach: The Obama administration has tried \u2014 through a variety of programs \u2014 to encourage the modification of loans, offering banks both incentives and penalties. In the past year, the administration has pushed for more loan forgiveness. It's backing a bill in Congress that would reduce fees for refinancing. Speaking in February in Virginia \u2014 another swing state \u2014 President Obama unveiled a refinancing program for those who are underwater but still current on payments. \"Too many families haven't been able to take advantage of the low rates, because falling prices lock them out of the market,\" he said. Michael Barr, a University of Michigan law professor, former Treasury official and surrogate for the Obama campaign, says that since the president took office, 16 million homeowners have refinanced, and 5 million more have modified their loans, through either a government or bank program. In a second term, Barr says, the president would both fine-tune existing programs and ensure that the new Dodd-Frank financial regulations create a strong safeguard for future homeowners. \"There is no silver bullet,\" he says. \"There are lots of things that need to get done. Each homeowner's circumstance is somewhat different. And trying to figure out how to get them help is, I think, a more complicated and difficult task than would be reflected in a bullet point or a sound bite.\" Romney's Approach: Late last fall, in an interview with the Las Vegas Review-Journal, Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney seemed to dismiss the government's efforts to modify loans. \"Don't try and stop the foreclosure process, let it run its course and hit the bottom, allow investors to buy homes, put renters in them, fix the homes up and let it turn around and come back up,\" he said. Former Republican Rep. Rick Lazio of New York, a spokesman on housing for the Romney campaign, says Romney would not abandon modification or refinancing programs. But he would focus more on rolling back new financial regulations, as well as on winding down mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac \u2014 a process the Obama administration has already begun. \"In our view, President Obama's response to the mortgage crisis has been slow, confused and largely ineffective,\" Lazio says. Lazio says Romney's fix for housing goes beyond specific policy prescriptions. \"Jobs and the economic picture is overwhelmingly the most important part of the solution,\" he says. The Reality: Urban Institute President Sarah Rosen Wartell says so far, the campaigns have a lot more in common than their rhetoric suggests. \"Many of the most interesting questions are places where neither candidate has laid out their direction,\" she says. Questions about government's role in the housing sector \u2014 from regulating access to credit, for example, to whether to eliminate the popular but expensive mortgage interest deduction. Questions that may not affect the immediate term, but could affect how the housing sector will function for years to come.",

But they haven't been specific about which tax breaks they want to eliminate.\n                \n                    \n                    Tim Boyle/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Both President Obama and rival Mitt Romney say the tax code is too complicated. But they haven't been specific about which tax breaks they want to eliminate. Here's something President Obama and Mitt Romney agree on: America's tax system is too complicated. Both men have outlined changes that are broadly similar, but with some important differences. The Problem: Today's tax code is like a department store, where the price tags are high, but there are lots of coupons, sales and weekend specials. That creates some inequities. Just as shoppers can pay different prices depending on which day they buy, taxpayers with the same income can pay very different rates depending on which deductions they qualify for. Tax breaks can also distort behavior the same way sale prices do. Would you really buy all those turtlenecks if they weren't 40 percent off? Would you really buy that McMansion if you couldn't deduct the interest payments? Reformers like Eugene Steuerle of the Urban Institute say the tax code would be both fairer and more efficient if it were more like a discount store, with fewer sales but everyday low pricing. \"There's broad agreement among economists from left to right that if you can broaden the tax base and lower tax rates, that would be a better tax system,\" Steuerle says. There's broad agreement among economists from left to right that if you can broaden the tax base and lower tax rates, that would be a better tax system. Eugene Steuerle of the Urban Institute Steuerle worked at the Treasury Department during the last big tax overhaul in the 1980s, when policymakers lowered tax rates dramatically and did away with numerous tax breaks. Since then, little by little, tax breaks have crept back in \u2014 and today, both Obama and Romney say it's time for another housecleaning. Two Approaches: Despite their superficial agreement, though, Tax Notes columnist Bruce Bartlett says the two men approach a tax overhaul with very different goals: \"For Republicans, it really only means one thing, and that is lowering statutory rates. ... When Democrats talk about tax reform, I think they're mainly concerned about the distribution of taxation and ... to get the wealthy to pay a larger share. So clearly there's an enormous gulf between their two perspectives.\" Romney's tax plan is mostly about lowering rates, though he would also eliminate loopholes so the amount of money the government collects stays the same. Obama's plan, on the other hand, is designed to raise more money to bring down the deficit, with lower tax rates thrown in as a sweetener. But here's the thing about the so-called loopholes in the tax code: They're not just for the superrich with secret bank accounts in the Cayman Islands. Berkeley economist Laura Tyson, who sits on a couple of White House advisory panels, notes that the two biggest tax breaks are for interest payments on home mortgages and the tax-free health insurance that many workers get from their employers. \"If you end up with a tax reform which significantly cuts something like the mortgage interest deduction, you're going to hit a lot of middle-class families,\" Tyson says. That's why both candidates run for cover when asked about the tax breaks they want to eliminate. On 60 Minutes, Scott Pelley pressed Romney: \"The devil's in the details, though. What are we talking about? The mortgage deduction, the charitable deduction?\" Romney replied: \"The devil's in the details. The angel is in the policy, which is creating more jobs.\" Obama was similarly evasive when NPR's Steve Inskeep tried to pin him down back in 2010. Inskeep said: \"Your deficit commission talked about lowering everybody's tax rate and eliminating deductions, such as changing the home mortgage deduction and many other deductions as well. That's the kind of plan you're talking about?\" \"Well, I have not specifically endorsed that plan,\" Obama responded. Obama said at the time he wanted to start a public conversation about a tax overhaul. But the conversation hasn't gone very far. The Reality: Steuerle of the Urban Institute says politicians know better than to call for higher taxes on the middle class. \"To be fair to them, that's partly because we the public, as voters, really penalize the candidates when they start identifying who's going to pay for government,\" Steuerle says. Tyson says Obama tried to thread this needle by leaving tax breaks in place for middle-class families while limiting deductions available to the very wealthy. \"That proposal really went no place politically, either among Democrats or among Republicans,\" she says. \"The president has proposed that again and again.\" Given the difficulty of fixing the individual tax system, Tyson says policymakers might start with a more modest effort to rewrite the corporate tax code. But Steuerle has his sights set higher. Steuerle says no matter which candidate is in the Oval Office next year, he will have to tackle the deficit or have little money left to spend on any of his other priorities. Steuerle thinks that could provide the impetus to do the hard work of a broad tax overhaul. \"Sometimes you finally get the person to go to the dentist when the pain from not going to the dentist is greater than the pain from going,\" he says. So far, though, it's been getting the candidates to talk specifics that has been like pulling teeth.",

            "article_content": "President Obama and GOP challenger Mitt Romney are busy cramming for their first debate. The face-off Wednesday night in Denver could be their best opportunity to sway undecided voters. The two men are squeezing in a bit of campaigning between practice sessions. Romney holds a campaign rally in Denver Monday, while Obama rallied with supporters in Las Vegas Sunday.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: It's MORNING EDITION from NPR News. Good morning, I'm Steve Inskeep. Today marks the start of the final full month of the presidential campaign. It is the month of the presidential debates and a month in which Mitt Romney will be looking for a shift of fortune. Most national polls remain relatively close, but the electoral map, a look at individual states, shows Romney with a bigger disadvantage. And a Washington Post survey contends Romney trails President Obama by 11 points among likely voters in swing states. A number of states do remain up for grabs. They include Colorado, which Romney visits today; and also the state of Nevada, which President Obama visited last night. NPR's Scott Horsley has our report this morning, from Las Vegas. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: This is a critical week in the Nevada political calendar. Would-be voters have until Saturday to register for the November election. Maggie Mora has been canvassing neighborhoods, signing people up. MAGGIE MORA: I'm going out there seven days a week, six hours, door to door, 108 degrees. But you know what? I believe everybody needs to learn how to vote out there. HORSLEY: The election may be five weeks away but early voting has already begun in Iowa, and it starts tomorrow in Ohio. Nevada residents can cast their ballots beginning October 20th. As a full Moon rose over Desert Pines High School in Las Vegas last night, President Obama urged thousands of supporters to do just that. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: I believe in you. And I ask you to keep on believing in me. (SOUNDBITE OF CHEERING) OBAMA: I'm asking for your vote. HORSLEY: Of all the battleground states, Nevada is one of the most hotly-contested, despite a strong union presence and a fast-growing Latino population, both of which tend to help the Democrats. Mr. Obama won easily here four years ago. But many Nevadans have grown dissatisfied with his leadership. This state has the nation's highest unemployment rate, above 12 percent. And its housing market was hit particularly hard. Some of the sand-colored subdivisions and strip malls that sprouted here during the housing bubble look as if they're ready to sink back into the desert. Little wonder then, that a recent NBC/Wall Street Journal poll found Mr. Obama with a narrow two-point lead in the state. Last night, he acknowledged the economy still has a long way to go. OBAMA: We're not where we need to be yet. We've got a lot more work to do here in Nevada and all across the country, to make the middle class secure again, to give ladders of opportunity to folks fighting to get into the middle-class. But the question is, whose plan is better for you? UNIDENTIFIED GROUP: Yours, Obama. Obama, Obama, Obama... HORSLEY: The president argues that Mitt Romney's economic plan - built around tax cuts and deregulation - is a warmed-over version of George W. Bush's policies. He urged his Las Vegas supporters not to bet on it. OBAMA: We don't need to double-down on the same trickle-down policies that got us into this mess in the first place. HORSLEY: Mr. Obama was introduced last night, by Chasstiry Vasquez, a daughter of Mexican immigrants who's now studying politics at UNLV. Vasquez took Romney to task for his comments, secretly taped at a Florida fundraiser earlier this year, that 47 percent of Americans don't pay income tax and won't take responsibility for their own lives. CHASSTIRY VASQUEZ: Mitt Romney just doesn't get it. We work hard and we're responsible, and no one is looking for a handout. We just want a president who will fight for all of us. (APPLAUSE) HORSLEY: Mr. Obama is holed up much of today and tomorrow at a resort just outside Las Vegas, preparing for Wednesday's debate. But he's likely to make at least one casual visit to the surrounding area, to keep his face on the TV news and in the local paper during this important week. Volunteer canvasser Maggie Mora says every little bit helps to get his message across. MORA: I know that he really wants to try to help the middle-class. And we're all middle-class peoples. And I know it's not going to be easy and it's going to be up and down. But you know what? At least he's trying. HORSLEY: Still, Nevada is likely to remain a hard-fought battleground. Florida Senator Marco Rubio will be headlining a pro-Romney rally in Las Vegas this afternoon. Scott Horsley, NPR News, Las Vegas. Copyright \u00a9 2012 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "Two ads released Wednesday by the campaigns of President Obama and Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney are worth noting because of how they illustrate the very different challenges now facing the two candidates. One thing both ads rest on is some form of guilt. For Obama, who has the advantage of being ahead in new polls in several battleground states, the challenge is to keep his supporters from assuming the president has victory in the bag, and therefore not voting. It's also a way to get them to vote in an election that lacks the history-making excitement of 2008, and which finds the hope of four years ago tempered by Washington reality. So Obama's new ad uses the tried-and-true marketing technique of anticipatory guilt. In an ad clearly aimed at younger voters with gay or female friends, the narrator says: \"What are you going to tell them? You were just too busy. You didn't think it mattered.\" (At this point, the screen is occupied by young men with video controllers in their hands who appear fixated on a game.) \"Is that what you're going to tell your friends who can't get married? The ones who couldn't serve openly in the military? Are you going to tell them they can't make decisions about their own bodies anymore because you didn't think your vote counted?\" You get the picture. With more than a month to go before Election Day, but with early voting either already under way or soon to start in some swing states, the Obama campaign is tugging firmly on the cord connected to the human guilt response. Romney, by contrast, was working on doing some damage control following the release of the now-infamous video in which he can be seen talking about the \"47 percent\" of the electorate. While he hasn't technically apologized for his remarks, Romney was clearly guilty of creating a controversy that appears to have hurt him in the polls. To many who saw the video Mother Jones made famous, Romney was reminiscent of Gordon Gekko. It didn't help that he was already being likened to that fictional Wall Street master of the universe even before the video from the fundraiser emerged. So Romney's ad featured the candidate talking directly into the camera to demonstrate that he does care about the concerns of average Americans. Repeating an argument he has turned to in recent days, Romney says in the ad: \"Too many Americans are struggling to find work in today's economy. Too many of those who are working are living paycheck to paycheck trying to make falling incomes meet rising prices for food and gas. More Americans are living in poverty than when President Obama took office and 15 million more are on food stamps. \"President Obama and I both care about poor and middle-class families. The difference is my policy will make things better for them ... \" Obviously, no presidential campaign would choose to spend its time and money essentially telling voters \"I care\" this late in the game. But it's a message Romney was forced into by the video made at the Boca Raton, Fla., fundraiser. Meanwhile, the Obama campaign is already shifting its media messaging into get-out-the-vote mode. And in any election, it's getting out your vote that, in the end, really matters.",

Polls show voters want the presidential candidates to provide more details on how they would reduce unemployment, change tax policy and alter government spending. As this presidential election year was kicking off, strategists were saying the focus would be on the economy. But now \u2014 even as absentee ballots are being filled in \u2014 the candidates are still dodging details about how to improve growth. \"President Obama doesn't have a plan,\" says Kevin Hassett, an economic adviser to Republican candidate Mitt Romney. Jeffrey Liebman, an economic adviser to President Obama, says Romney has revealed no plan other than \"going back to the failed policies of the past decade.\" One independent economist, David Pritchett, who used to work for the International Monetary Fund, listened Monday as the two advisers debated economic policy at the National Press Club in Washington. His verdict: \"There should be more specifics.\" This would seem to be a good time for the candidates to reveal more of their plans. Most voters remain deeply worried about the economy, and many have not yet decided who would do a better job of fixing it. A national CNBC poll released Tuesday shows 55 percent of the 800 Americans surveyed say the economy is worse now than when Obama's term began. But there is no clear majority for which candidate would do a better job of fixing the economy in the future. The poll showed 43 percent say Obama would do a better job, compared with 34 percent for Romney. But a huge chunk of voters \u2014 22 percent \u2014 say they simply don't know who would do a better job with the economy in the future. Other polls show voters want the candidates to provide more details on how they would reduce unemployment, change tax policy and alter government spending. But they aren't getting much. During an interview aired Sunday by CBS's 60 Minutes, Romney declined to specify which tax deductions and exemptions he would eliminate to make it possible to lower tax rates. When asked for clarity, he said: \"Well, that's something Congress and I will have to work out together.\" On the same news show, Obama was pushed to explain why the unemployment rate remains above 8 percent. His response was that \"the hole was so deep when we got in [office] that we lost 9 million jobs. We've created 4.6 [million].\" On Monday, a debate on the candidates' economic plans was sponsored by the National Association for Business Economics. The event, held at the National Press Club, featured Hassett and Liebman. Both agreed the No. 1 problem for businesses is the lack of customers. \"Insufficient demand, for sure,\" Hassett said. But they disagreed over how to stimulate demand for goods and services. Liebman talked up Obama's support for a jobs bill to create more work for teachers, firefighters and construction workers. By spending more on infrastructure, schools and public safety, the government could spur consumer demand, Liebman said. If tax rates for the wealthy \"go back to the same rate as [under] President Clinton, you can create enough revenue to bring the deficit down and you don't have to whack the middle class,\" Liebman said. Hassett said Obama's deficit-reduction plan is built on \"phantom savings.\" Romney would cut taxes for everyone, including the wealthiest, and pay for the cuts by controlling spending, Hassett said. But he would not specify which one \u2014 cutting spending or lowering tax rates \u2014 would be the higher priority for Romney. He said he had not directly discussed that topic with the candidate. The lack of specifics may be a good indicator of just how tough the problems are. Congress already has spent vast amounts on economic stimulus programs to create jobs. It has bailed out banks and shored up automakers and reduced taxes. Now, going forward, the White House and Congress must move toward making much more painful choices involving spending and taxes to reduce deficits. \"I don't see any basis for optimism,\" Pritchett said after listening to the debate. The choices will be so difficult, no elected leader will want to make them. \"There already are so many lines drawn in the sand that I don't see how you get to compromises,\" he said. Though lots of details must still be filled in, here are the key points each candidate has made: ROMNEY -- Boost domestic fossil fuel production. -- Improve education by increasing school choice and changing teacher evaluations. -- Expand international trade while curtailing \"unfair\" trade policies, particularly those involving China. -- Cut federal spending. -- Repeal the Affordable Health Care Act, supported by Democrats, who are likely to retain control of the Senate. Romney says he would allow each state to craft its own specific plan for expanding health care coverage. -- Repeal the Dodd-Frank financial regulation law and replace it with more streamlined rules for Wall Street. OBAMA -- Create 1 million manufacturing jobs and expand exports. -- Push Congress to invest more in infrastructure projects to create jobs. -- Make \"education a national mission\" and increase job training. -- Create \"a tax code that makes sure everybody pays their fair share,\" including tax increases for those earning over $250,000 a year. -- Reduce federal debt by $4 trillion over one decade. -- Eliminate tax breaks for companies that send jobs overseas.",

Mitt Romney's Friday release of his 2011 tax return puts that issue back in the headlines just when it had slipped largely off many people's radar screens. Of course, it wasn't exactly as though the other headlines the Republican presidential nominee has made of late were all that helpful to his presidential campaign. At this point, maybe his campaign has taken so many hits, the release of information showing he and his wife, Ann, paid a 14.1 percent effective rate in 2011 on $13.7 million of income and that their rate averaged 20.2 percent over a 20-year period can't inflict much more harm. There was something in Romney's tax data on which both his allies and opponents could fixate. For instance, the Romneys donated more than $4 million to charity in 2011 but claimed only $2.25 million in donations. That level of charity was lauded by supporters like Rep. Catherine McMorris Rogers, a member of the House leadership who, in a statement on the campaign's website, said Romney's donations \"are to be admired.\" But drawing the attention of some critics was the explanation for why Romney didn't claim all the charitable deductions he was entitled to under Internal Revenue Service rules. Brad Malt, a lawyer who oversees Romney's trust, said Romney's effective tax rate would have come in lower if the former Massachusetts governor had claimed the entirety of his donations. That would have been a problem because it would have conflicted with a statement Romney made earlier during the campaign that his effective tax rate had been at least 13 percent in each of the past 10 years. So Romney paid more taxes than he had to. But that conflicted with another statement from earlier this year, when he said during a Republican primary debate: \"I pay all the taxes legally required and not a dollar more.\" This handout image provided by the Romney campaign shows the front page of Mitt Romney's 2011 tax return.\n                \n                    \n                    AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption This handout image provided by the Romney campaign shows the front page of Mitt Romney's 2011 tax return. At another point, he said during an ABC News interview that if he had paid more taxes than he owed, that would disqualify him from the presidency. His exact words: \"I don't pay more than are legally due and frankly if I had paid more than are legally due I don't think I'd be qualified to become president.\" Despite that, he paid more taxes than he owed. None of this bought him any respite from perhaps his biggest nemesis on his personal taxes \u2014 Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. Reid's office issued a statement: \"The information released today reveals that Mitt Romney manipulated one of the only two years of tax returns he's seen fit to show the American people \u2014 and then only to 'conform' with his public statements. That raises the question: what else in those returns has Romney manipulated? ... \"It's also galling to see the creative accounting Mitt Romney applied to his own tax returns only days after learning of his insulting comments that seniors, soldiers and hard-working parents don't pay enough taxes.\" President Obama's campaign piled on as well: \"Today's release of Mitt Romney's 2011 tax returns confirms what we already knew \u2014 that people like Mitt Romney pay a lower tax rate than many middle class families because of a set of complex loopholes and tax shelters only available to those at the top. Yet, Mitt Romney still wants to give multi-millionaires an additional $250,000 tax cut at the expense of middle class taxpayers who will see their taxes go up.\" It wasn't just Democrats criticizing Romney on Friday after the release of his tax information. Alex Castellanos, a GOP strategist, was quoted by Politico.com's Maggie Haberman thusly: \" 'At first I thought this was an April Fool's Joke,' said Castellanos, who tweeted something to that effect at me earlier. 'But it isn't April. I can't imagine that David Axelrod will now say, I'm glad Mitt put this issue behind him. This will drag Mitt's taxes back into the debate. And there's not many days left. I just can't imagine why they would do this. There are 40 days left and you have now made more of them about Mitt's taxes ... you don't serve a life sentence and then confess afterward. They've taken their beating on this (already). ... I just don't understand how a (being) \"little pregnant\" strategy (works).' \" While some questioned the timing of the Romney tax dump, it wasn't as though the Republican presidential nominee had much more time. Having filed with the IRS for an extension earlier this year, the Oct. 15 deadline was approaching. That's one day before the second presidential debate. Putting the information out now could make it seem like old news by then.",

            "article_content": "Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney has been busy after a tape emerged of him telling wealthy donors that nearly half of Americans see themselves as victims dependent on the federal government. Now he's trying to make those remarks part of a broader argument: What is the proper role of government and who should pay for it?  RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: Republican Mitt Romney has been trying to reframe his much criticized remarks - when he said that almost half of Americans see themselves as victims who are entitled to free services. Now he's working to make a broader argument about the role of government, as NPR's Mara Liasson reports. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: There will be no more secretly recorded videos at Romney fundraisers because the Romney campaign has now decided to open fundraisers to the press. In Atlanta on Wednesday, Romney told his donors that he has a starkly different vision for the country than President Obama. Instead of a government-centered society that takes from some and gives to others, Romney said, he believes in personal responsibility and free enterprise. MITT ROMNEY: This is how America works. It does not work by a government saying become dependent on government. Become dependent upon redistribution. That will kill the American entrepreneurship that's lifted our economy over the years. LIASSON: But Romney's earlier statement that 47 percent of Americans feel entitled to a handout is still out there - a big fat softball that the president can't stop hitting. Here's Mr. Obama yesterday at a Univision town hall in Miami. (SOUNDBITE OF UNIVISION BROADCAST) LIASSON: Romney hasn't backed away from those remarks, but he has tried to revise and extend them. Instead of talking about the 47 percent, he now says he's for the 100 percent and that his policies can help the middle class and reduce poverty. The culture of dependency argument is a familiar conservative theme. Romney's running mate, Paul Ryan, used it in his acceptance speech at the GOP convention. (SOUNDBITE OF REPUBLICAN CONVENTION) LIASSON: The idea that entitlements sap the American spirit and undermine freedom is the subject of a new book called \"A Nation of Takers\" by Nick Eberstadt of the American Enterprise Institute. Eberstadt points to data that show Romney is right about one thing: about half of Americans now receive some kind of government check, including Social Security and veterans' benefits. And that, Eberstadt says, has a corrosive effect on American character and behavior. NICK EBERSTADT: There's an increasing proclivity to tax the unborn, to pay for current Social Security and Medicare benefits through borrowing, which is going to have to be paid for by future generations, that encourages a sort of a something-for-nothing mentality. LIASSON: Former Clinton White House aide Bill Galston, now at the Brookings Institution, has been having a dialogue with Eberstadt in the op-ed pages of the Wall Street Journal. BILL GALSTON: Even if you want to use the category of maker and taker, it's by no means clear which is which. We have means-tested programs for the poor, we have an entitlement system that benefits the middle-class, and then we have a tax code of exemptions and credits and deductions and loopholes that disproportionately benefits the wealthy. So who is the maker and who is the taker? I think it's not so simple. LIASSON: Dartmouth Professor Dean Lacy notes many who receive government benefits don't feel they're getting a handout, particularly in states like Florida, where both Romney and the president campaigned yesterday. DEAN LACY: Well, seniors receiving Social Security, they've paid into it before they receive it. So even though they may be net beneficiaries of federal spending now, I don't think they feel like victims. LIASSON: And, says Lacy, his surveys show that most people do not have an accurate idea of whether or how much they are dependent on the government. LACY: Only about 23 percent of Americans think they're dependent on the federal government. They think that they're getting more back than they pay in taxes. So the other three-quarters think that they're paying more in taxes than they get back. Now, some of those people are wrong. LIASSON: Over time, more people are getting back more in benefits than they pay in taxes. And while that might not create the culture of dependency that Paul Ryan and Mitt Romney decry, it has created a big fiscal problem. Nick Eberstadt... EBERSTADT: Arithmetically, there are only a couple of ways of solving the entitlement epidemic, and one of them is to raise taxes a whole lot, or the other is to reign in it in and that means changing people's expectations about the future. And there may not be a whole lot of votes in that for anybody. LIASSON: It's a big leap to go from attacking a redistributionist government to explaining how you would put an end to it - for instance, by taking away the earned income tax credit for the working poor or means-testing Medicare benefit for the middle-class. Yesterday, Romney sounded like he was coming to the aid to the takers as he attacked the president for taking $45 billion in Medicare benefits away from Florida seniors.

Cuban-Americans know a thing or two about what can happen when a government seizes wealth and redistributes it, as Fidel Castro's regime did five decades ago in Cuba. So Mitt Romney had an especially receptive audience Wednesday night at a rally of Cuban-Americans in Miami, when he launched his campaign's latest line of attack on President Obama. \"He said some years ago something which we're hearing about today on the Internet,\" Romney told the crowd. \"He said that he believes in redistribution.\" Romney was referring to ads posted online this week by the Republican National Committee. They contain snippets of a 14-year-old video of then-Illinois state Sen. Barack Obama discussing city government and public policy at a university forum. 'I Actually Believe In Redistribution' \"I think the trick is figuring out how do we structure government systems that pool resources and, hence, facilitate some redistribution, because I actually believe in redistribution,\" Obama can be heard saying on the video, from 1998. In the original recording, the future president went on to stress the need to foster competition and innovation in the marketplace. But that was left out of the ads. Romney gave the crowd in Miami his own take on his rival's erstwhile remarks. \"There are people who believe that you can create a stronger economy and a brighter future if you take from some people and give to other people,\" Romney said, as the crowd yelled \"No\" in response. \"Other places that have tried that haven't done so well,\" said Romney. \"That is not a philosophy that's ever been tried here and we're not gonna have it here.\" Progressive Taxation In fact, taking from some and giving to others is a concept long enshrined in the nation's tax code. At a town hall last year, Romney himself rejected taxing everyone at the same flat rate. \"There are some tax proposals that are called a flat tax that I don't agree with because they end up being huge breaks for the highest-income Americans, of which I happen to have been one, still am, and I'm not looking for a tax break for me,\" Romney said. Taxing wealthy people at a higher rate than others is what's known as progressive taxation. \"I think we've always had a progressive taxation system, and most tax reform proposals that I've seen, including those that have been put forward by Gov. Romney, are progressive,\" said South Dakota Republican Sen. John Thune, one of Romney's closest allies. Earlier this year, Romney laid out a tax plan he promised would benefit all equally: \"I'm gonna make an across-the-board, 20 percent reduction in marginal, individual income tax rates; 20 percent down, across the board,\" said Romney. 'Redistribution At Its Worst' But what Romney proposed, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, would cut average federal tax rates for the bottom 40 percent of income earners by about 3 percent, while those in the top 1/10th of 1 percent would have their rates cut nearly 22 percent. \"You'd have to say it's regressive,\" said Eric Toder, co-director of the Tax Policy Center. \"It helps the highest-income people proportionately more.\" Romney, he says, has promised to eliminate enough still-unspecified tax loopholes for the wealthy to make his tax plan equitable. \"Based on what he's ruled out, we don't think he can do it. But nonetheless, that is what he's claiming,\" said Toder. Democrats, meanwhile, are turning Romney's latest line of attack against him. \"The Romney-Ryan budget is a distributionist budget,\" Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, said Wednesday. \"It distributes wealth from the middle class to the wealthy. That's redistribution at its worst.\" Democrats also say Republicans back another form of redistribution: Of the top 10 states receiving more in federal funding than what they paid in federal taxes, nine went for the GOP nominee in the last presidential election.",

            "article_content": "One person, other than President Obama, who appears to have benefited from the Democratic National Convention is Elizabeth Warren, the party's nominee for U.S. Senate in Massachusetts. Polls out this week show Warren opening a lead over her Republican rival Senator Scott Brown.  RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: And in one of the closest Senate races in the country, it looks like two politicians may be reversing their positions. Massachusetts Republican incumbent Scott Brown had maintained a slim lead in the polls for months, now suddenly he's trailing his Democratic challenger Elizabeth Warren in four of the five most recent voter surveys. From member station WBUR in Boston, Curt Nickisch reports it may be the result of an unusual convention bounce. CURT NICKISCH, BYLINE: Elizabeth Warren is no Washington wannabe newbie. She got the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau up and running, an agency she proposed and pushed. Then, after Republican senators blocked her from leading it, she decided to run for political office for the first time. And it shows. Her campaign got bogged down answering questions about her Native American ancestry. Her television ads looked a little amateurish. Analysts have even been saying the Harvard law school professor needs to get rid of her granny glasses. (APPLAUSE) ELIZABETH WARREN: Thank you. Thank you. NICKISCH: But this week, at a campaign event in Boston's Dorchester neighborhood, Warren shrugged off her sudden frontrunner status like an old political hand. WARREN: Me, I'm out there every single day, working for every single vote. And that would be true, regardless of where I am in the polls. I'm just out here having fun. I'm out here talking to people. I'm out here talking about what we have a chance to do in this election. NICKISCH: Four out of the last five polls place Elizabeth Warren ahead, though narrowly. One out yesterday from WBUR, has her five points in front. Combine that with the first attack ad in the race, and suddenly, Scott Brown is on the defensive. (SOUNDBITE OF AD) SENATOR SCOTT BROWN: Have you seen Elizabeth Warren's latest ads? Instead of talking about things that matter, like jobs, she's being dishonest about who I am and what I stand for... NICKISCH: Normally Brown's TV spots show the self-confident incumbent coasting in his pickup truck, or embracing his wife, a TV reporter. Not this recent one. (SOUNDBITE OF AD) BROWN: Don't be fooled by Elizabeth Warren's negative attacks. Like a lot of you, I came from nothing. I'm on your side, fighting for the middle class, an Independent voice you can count on. NICKISCH: Scott Brown has carefully cultivated an image as an independent, ever since he scored an amazing upset two years ago, winning Ted Kennedy's old Senate seat in a special election. The moderate image has served Brown well in a state where registered Democrats outnumber Republicans three to one. University of Massachusetts political scientist Paul Watanabe says it's not a coincidence that Brown has lost his narrow lead at a time when political divisions came into sharper relief. PAUL WATANABE: It is a convention bump. But it has more to do than just Elizabeth Warren's having appeared on national television and appeared at that convention. NICKISCH: It also has to do with a convention speech that wasn't given. At the Republican National Convention, Scott Brown barely dropped in, trying to keep his distance from GOP platform issues that are unpopular back here in Massachusetts. J.T. KLETTE: It's hard to separate Scott Brown from the Republican National Party. I mean, that's just really it. NICKISCH: Voter J.T. Klette says he realized that voting for Scott Brown would be voting for Republicans to take control of the Senate. KLETTE: You know, I'm nervous that they don't represent who I am here in Massachusetts. You know, and I think right now Elizabeth Warren represents it significantly better than Scott Brown does. NICKISCH: Warren's bounce in recent polls frustrates voter Jeff Carlson, a financial analyst who's not a fan of her attacks on Wall Street. Warren has lived in Massachusetts for 20 years, but Carlson's bothered by the Oklahoma twang you can still hear in her voice. JEFF CARLSON: You know, she's an outsider to Massachusetts. And residents of the Commonwealth aren't too fond of outsiders. So it's seems to boggle me a little bit that they've attached to her so quickly. NICKISCH: There's plenty of time for residents to detach and reattach and detach again. Four televised debates beginning tonight will give undecided voters more on which to base their decision - one that could pivot control of the U.S. Senate. For NPR News, I'm Curt Nickisch, in Boston.

And now it's on course to be the nastiest \u2014 and in the current political environment, that's a high bar to reach. Incumbent Democrat Sherrod Brown was expecting a tough challenge as he sought a second term, after a bitter battle against Republican Mike DeWine in 2006.

Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, speaks at a campaign rally on Sept. 1 in Cincinnati. And he's getting it from Ohio Treasurer Josh Mandel, who proved himself a rising star to the GOP in 2010 because of his ability to deliver money and votes. But Mandel's victorious campaign for treasurer two years ago was so unpleasant that a major newspaper endorsed a third-party candidate rather than Mandel or the incumbent. The 34-year-old Mandel began his campaign against Brown this spring with positive ads highlighting his roots, his youth and his service as a Marine and in government. But the campaign quickly turned ugly as outside money poured into the race \u2014 on both sides, but tipping heavily toward Mandel and against Brown. Ads slammed Brown for his support of the Affordable Care Act, for President Obama's environmental policies and for spending nearly four decades as a \"career politician.\" Sen. Sherrod Brown speaks before a campaign rally for President Obama at Ohio State University in Columbus on May 5.\n                \n                    \n                    Mark Duncan/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Sen. Sherrod Brown speaks before a campaign rally for President Obama at Ohio State University in Columbus on May 5. Brown, 59, blasted back at Mandel for not attending meetings, for his hiring practices and for fundraising around the U.S. and even outside it. When the fact-checkers started weighing in, Mandel ended up with some very poor scores. Brown got a few \"false\" ratings from PolitiFact, and one \"pants on fire\" \u2014 its worst rating. Mandel has collected the \"pants on fire\" rating six times. One of Mandel's ads got three separate \"pants on fire\" or \"false\" rulings alone, and the Brown campaign has launched a website labeling Mandel a liar. The allegations don't seem to bother Mandel. In an interview with me in April, Mandel said he has \"facts, and if a biased media organization wants to disagree with those facts, that's their prerogative. But the facts are on our side, and we're going to continue to tell those facts.\" But ratings from fact-checkers have now become an ad on their own. Brown's newest ad is simply called \"Pants on Fire.\" Mandel's campaign says Brown \"is trying to scare Ohio's seniors and distract the middle class from his record of failure.\" Mandel also has a new ad, called \"A Different Set of Rules,\" which claims Brown has been missing votes in the Senate. Brown's campaign calls that the \"most ridiculous and misleading attack yet.\" The candidates have raised at least $25 million so far, and Mandel has been significantly outpacing Brown in spending. And the candidates' own ads aren't the only ones. Almost $18 million in outside money has been spent so far against Brown and supporting Mandel, from nine groups including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and Karl Rove's Crossroads GPS, as well as the largely unknown Government Integrity Fund.

            "article_content": "Mitt Romney speaks at a fundraiser in Dallas on Tuesday.\n                \n                    \n                    Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Mitt Romney speaks at a fundraiser in Dallas on Tuesday. Republicans scrambling to turn Mitt Romney's videotaped aspersions cast on 47 percent of Americans into a campaign opportunity are hoping for a \"Chick-fil-A moment.\" At least that's the battle cry of conservative blogger Erick Erickson, among a small but increasingly vocal cadre of Republicans urging the GOP presidential candidate to step up and better define and defend the surreptitiously taped comments about government dependency he made at a May fundraising dinner. The Chick-fil-A moment reference? Erickson says at his RedState blog that he believes there are many potential voters who would embrace Romney's larger point about government entitlements. And that they'd emerge like the thousands who turned out recently to support the anti-same sex marriage owner of the chicken restaurant after gay rights activists called for a boycott. \"I think [Romney] needs to now own this statement, articulate it better than he did at that dinner, and actually now have a substantive policy on entitlement reform,\" Erickson told NPR's Steve Inskeep on Wednesday. \"We always lament that politicians are too guarded, don't say what they mean and don't speak honestly,\" Erickson said. \"Here, he was, and now we're beating him up for it.\" Romney has been savaged by Democrats, and some members of his own party, after a videotape was disseminated on the website of Mother Jones magazine showing him referring to 47 percent of Americans as tax deadbeats who believe they are \"victims\" entitled to government-provided health care, food, housing and \"you name it.\" In the wake of the widespread airing of his secretly taped comments, which came after a series of Romney stumbles over the previous week, Democrats pounced and many Republicans despaired \u2014 not only at the substance of Romney's comments but also at the timing. Romney has publicly referred to his comments as \"not elegantly stated\" and \"off the cuff,\" but has not backed down on his central premise about government dependence. With fresh polls continuing to show Romney's race against President Obama close (though no major surveys have been conducted post-video dissemination), some Republicans are urging an end to the party freak-out and encouraging GOP partisans to embrace Romney's reworded narrative. And here it is, under the unapologetic candidate's name, in Wednesday's edition of USAToday: \"We're experiencing the worst recovery since the Great Depression. Unemployment has been above 8 percent for 43 straight months; 47 million Americans are on food stamps. Nearly one in six Americans now live in poverty. Under President Obama, we have a stagnant economy that fostered government dependency. My policies will create a growing economy that fosters upward mobility.\" Along with Romney's embrace of the \"food stamp nation\" argument, the Republican National Committee has been promoting a 1998 video of Obama, then an Illinois state senator, talking about his support for \"redistribution\" of wealth to \"make sure everybody has a shot.\" The RNC also has a new ad highlighting the \"redistribution\" theme. The ad also includes a clip of Obama's now infamous \"you didn't build that\" statement about how government and communities help businesses prosper, followed by this snippet of Romney's convention speech: \"In America, we celebrate success \u2014 we don't apologize for success.\" And CNN reports that the Romney superPAC \"Restore Our Future\" is going up with an ad in Wisconsin and Michigan that seeks to refocus debate on the economy. While the national unemployment rate in August was 8.1 percent, the new ad claims the \"real\" unemployment rate is nearly 19 percent \u2014 a figure it gets by extrapolating from unemployment rate numbers and statistics about workers who have stopped looking for jobs. A dueling Obama \"Priorities USA Action\" superPAC ad that will run in six swing states stays focused on Romney's video comments, contrasting an image of the Florida mansion where the fundraiser occurred with a simple frame house. \"Victims?\" the voiceover says, \"beyond these doors, middle-class families struggle. ... Mitt Romney will never convince us he's on our side.\" The conservative Heritage Foundation on Wednesday also sought to reframe Romney's stumble, turning out an analysis that asserts that the candidate's characterization of 47 percent of Americans as government-dependent and paying no taxes holds statistical water. \"While these groups are not necessarily one in the same,\" Heritage says, \"there is overlap between the two, and the percentages on government dependency and nontaxpaying are very similar.\" Despite the reframing flurry, influential Republican voices remain unconvinced that the party can spin this dross into gold. Wall Street Journal columnist Peggy Noonan on Wednesday suggested that the Romney campaign needs an \"intervention.\" And syndicated columnist Kathleen Parker says that \"cyborg\" Romney needs to show he understands that \"the problems he's solving actually involve people.\" Again, on NPR's Morning Edition, Erick Erickson defended Romney's comments about the 47 percent as an unfortunate conflation of two different groups but a politically realistic assertion. There are, Erickson said, 47 percent of people in the nation who will vote for Obama and 47 percent who will vote for Romney. \"Mitt Romney was trying to say that he's got to focus on the people in between, in the gap, to get to them,\" he said. \"The problem was he pivoted immediately and started talking about how there's also 47 percent of people in the nation who don't pay income tax.\" \"I really don't think he intended to merge them together,\" Erickson said. \"But I don't think it hurts him as much as a lot of people say.\" A Chick-fil-A moment? That will be up to those voters in the \"47 percent\" that Romney needs. And it's too early to tell whether they will be convinced by Erickson's argument that Romney conflated and confounded, and didn't mean exactly \u2014 or at least didn't exactly mean \u2014 what he said. And about Chick-fil-A: On Wednesday it was revealed that the restaurant chain will no longer give money to anti-gay rights organizations.",

            "article_content": "In secretly-recorded comments released Monday, GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney referred to some 47 percent of Americans who pay no income tax, are dependent on the federal government for assistance, and will vote for President Obama no matter what. Something near 47 percent falls in each category, but they are three distinct groups.  ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Robert Siegel. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: And I'm Audie Cornish. Republican presidential hopeful Mitt Romney admits he could've used more elegant language, but he's not backing down. Romney was secretly recorded speaking at a fundraiser in May and his comments were publicized yesterday by the liberal magazine \"Mother Jones.\" Here he is telling wealthy backers that President Obama has a built-in base of support. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO) MITT ROMNEY: There are 47 percent who are with him, who are dependent upon government, who believe that they are victims, who believe the government has a responsibility to care for them, who believe that they're entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you-name-it. That that's an entitlement. And the government should give it to them. And they will vote for this president no matter what. CORNISH: Romney also said that 47 percent of the public pays no income tax. NPR's Scott Horsley begins our coverage. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: There's a lot to unpack in Romney's comment, which the candidate himself has described as off-the-cuff, but he seems to conflate people who don't pay income tax with those who are dependent on government benefits. On the tax question at least, his number is about right. Bob Williams of the Tax Policy Center says about 46 percent of Americans paid no income tax last year. At the worst of the recession, that number was above 50 percent. BOB WILLIAMS: About half the people paying no federal income tax just have incomes too low. The other half benefit from the various tax preferences. HORSLEY: Williams adds that most of those who don't pay federal income tax do pay other taxes, including the payroll tax, which helps to cover the cost of Medicare and Social Security. WILLIAMS: About 3 out of 5 were working and paid federal payroll taxes. So, they're paying taxes, just not income taxes. And of the remainder, most are either elderly and retired or low-income families with children. HORSLEY: More Americans will pay income taxes as the economy and incomes recover, but that won't erase a longer-term trend. The fraction of Americans paying no income tax has roughly doubled since the early 1990s. That's because policymakers increasingly rely on tax credits to reward low-wage workers, parents and others. In some cases, the refundable credits more than cancel out their total income tax bill. WILLIAMS: Congress has chosen to use the tax system as a way of delivering benefits to families, rather than creating new spending programs. It's a lot easier to go home and say, I cut your taxes, then to go home and says, I created a new spending program, even though you can do the same thing through either means. HORSLEY: At the same time, the Census Bureau says more and more Americans are collecting government benefits in form or another, and more of those benefits are flowing to middle-class families, rather than just the very poor. Chief economist Will McBride of the non-partisan Tax Foundation says there's always been a concern about that imbalance. WILL MCBRIDE: The danger there is that in a democracy, if the tax burden is, say, entirely borne by a minority of voters, then you have an incentive for the majority to lobby for more generous government spending because they're not paying for it. HORSLEY: So far, though, there's little evidence of that happening. DEAN LACY: The blue states are subsidizing the red states. HORSLEY: Dean Lacy is a political scientist at Dartmouth who's looked at which counties and states are net taxpayers to the federal government and which are net benefit collectors. LACY: The states that receive the most overall in federal spending per tax dollar paid are the most Republican and they've been increasingly so since the 1990s. The states that are paying the most in taxes per federal dollar received are the most Democratic. HORSLEY: Lacy suspects until now Republicans have been able to cast symbolic votes for smaller government without really jeopardizing their own popular benefits. With determined budget cutters, like Romney and Paul Ryan on the ticket, though, that could change. Scott Horsley, NPR News, Washington. Copyright \u00a9 2012 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "Rowdy Smith, who brought his sons to the St. Louis Rams game on Sunday, said that President Obama's \"not a leader\" and is hurting the energy industry. He's shown here walking in front of the Americans for Prosperity campaign bus.\n                \n                    \n                    Alan Greenblatt/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Rowdy Smith, who brought his sons to the St. Louis Rams game on Sunday, said that President Obama's \"not a leader\" and is hurting the energy industry. He's shown here walking in front of the Americans for Prosperity campaign bus. There's nothing like a ready-made crowd to help a group get its message out. That's why a conservative political organization set up shop Sunday outside the St. Louis Rams-Washington Redskins NFL football game. Why mix politics and football? \"People are here,\" explained Patrick Werner, Missouri state director for Americans for Prosperity. Football fans are used to encountering promotional tents for sports-talk radio stations and brands of beer and mixed nuts on their way to the game. Not so many of them expect to discuss politics as part of the pregame festivities. But Werner and his staff managed to attract attention from a large number of people who were willing to give up personal information such as email addresses in return for a free green T-shirt. Americans for Prosperity is largely known for running multimillion-dollar ad campaigns in support of conservative causes. The group spent some $25 million airing ads critical of President Obama last month in 11 states. Patrick Werner, Missouri state director for Americans for Prosperity, outside the St. Louis Rams-Washington Redskins football game Sunday in St. Louis.\n                \n                    \n                    Alan Greenblatt/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Patrick Werner, Missouri state director for Americans for Prosperity, outside the St. Louis Rams-Washington Redskins football game Sunday in St. Louis. But Americans for Prosperity is also trying a retail approach. The group is currently on a tour of more than 350 stops in 16 states, seeking to approach and energize citizens individually to turn out to vote. AFP parked a big, green bus in a lot directly catty-corner to the Edward Jones Dome in downtown St. Louis, emblazoned with a profile of the president and his infamous, if decontextualized, quote about business: \"You didn't build that.\" Julie O'Keefe, a St. Louis attorney, is embarrassed when her sons yell, \"I hate Obama\" as they pass the bus. \"We didn't teach them to say that,\" she said. But she doesn't disagree with them. \"[Obama is] lying when he says [Mitt] Romney is going to raise taxes on the middle class,\" O'Keefe said. \"That's total class warfare.\" Like a number of passersby, O'Keefe said she had never heard of Americans for Prosperity until their tour pulled into St. Louis this weekend. The group is largely funded by Charles and David Koch, brother billionaire oil men from Kansas who have become bugaboos for liberals thanks to their generous support of conservative organizations such as AFP. More people stopping by the bus, in fact, seem to have heard of the Kochs than Americans for Prosperity itself. Nevertheless, the group's message resonates. A number of people who disdain President Obama tick off as their reasons several of the same issues the group has bannered across its bus, including the $16 trillion national debt and persistently high unemployment. St. Louis gave Obama 84 percent of its vote in 2008, but there are plenty of more conservative voters in surrounding counties in Missouri and across the Mississippi River in Illinois. Rowdy Smith drove north about 25 miles from Barnhardt, Mo., to bring his family, all wearing Rams jerseys, to the game. \"Obama's a mess, not a leader,\" said Smith, who works for a coal company. \"Hopefully, Obama loses, but the liberal mainstream media will do their best to keep him in there because he's their candidate.\" But many of those who opposed Obama didn't seem fired up about Republican Mitt Romney. \"He's what we've got,\" as one voter said. Few seemed interested in signing up to do work for AFP or the campaign. \"We're gonna vote and everybody's going to know how,\" said St. Louis resident Maria Clements, but she wasn't planning to do more than that. Emily Pindell, who lives in Edwardsville, Ill., was enjoying beers and barbecue beside her car with her husband before the game. She kept standing up from her folding chair, offering to take pictures of people in front of the AFP bus. It was rare for anyone to beg off because they were Obama supporters. Jim Engle, a construction sales director in St. Louis, didn't want to pose for any pictures, but he took a few shots of the bus anyway, saying he's going to send them to friends who aren't fans of Obama, either. \"The bus caught my eye,\" he said. \"That's pretty creative.\"",

The swing state has a large manufacturing base where many blame China for depressing its industry.\" Also citing \"senior administration officials,\" the Plain Dealer says that the administration will make the case to the World Trade Organization that China \"undercuts manufacturers in Ohio and elsewhere by reducing the cost of Chinese auto parts\" and that the practice also \"encourages U.S. companies to outsource jobs.\" The Plain Dealer also writes that in a separate action, the administration will ask the WTO \"to step up a review of what the White House says are unfair duties that China levies on American-made cars.\" Update at 1:05 p.m. ET.

In a brief statement, the WTO said the products included steel, tires, magnets, chemicals, kitchen appliances, wood flooring and wind towers.\" Meanwhile, the wire service writes: \"Obama told thousands gathered at a pavilion in Cincinnati's leafy Eden Park that Romney made money from companies that outsourced jobs to China while running the private equity firm Bain Capital. The crowd jeered. Obama responded, 'Don't boo. Vote!' \" 'You can't stand up to China when all you've done is send them our jobs,' Obama said. 'You can talk a good game. But I like to walk the walk, not just talk the talk. And my experience has been waking up every single day doing everything I can to make sure that American workers get a fair shot in the global economy.' \"Romney responded in a statement accusing Obama of ignoring China for too long. The Republican promised to act from his first day in office to help U.S. businesses compete. \" 'Campaign-season trade cases may sound good on the stump, but it is too little, too late for American businesses and middle class families,' Romney said. 'President Obama's credibility on this issue has long since vanished.' \" Update at 10:05 a.m. ET.

Those are states where President Obama has also been spending considerable time campaigning lately, but where he's facing a barrage of attack ads from his Republican rival and the conservative superPACs, such as American Crossroads, and nonprofit advocacy groups, like Americans for Prosperity. In an interview with KUNC in Colorado, Americans for Prosperity president Tim Phillips said decisions about where and when to place ads are always fluid, saying recent polls showing Obama with sizable leads in Michigan and Pennsylvania had little to do with his group's decision. \"It doesn't mean that you wouldn't go back there at some point soon,\" Phillips said. \"Dollars are not endless; you have to make sure that every dollar you spend is in a place where it'll make a difference.\" According to The Associated Press, Americans for Prosperity, funded by billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch, and the Karl Rove-backed American Crossroads, have pulled their ads in Michigan and Pennsylvania and are now pouring nearly $13 million into Colorado, Florida, Iowa, North Carolina, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Nevada, Ohio, Virginia, Wisconsin and Minnesota. Phillips predicted his group's activity would be far less fluid in states like Colorado until the election. Most polls have shown Obama and Romney in a statistical dead heat in the Centennial State. \"This part of the country \u2014 Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico \u2014 they've been hit pretty hard [economically] and they haven't seen the results from the president's policies,\" he said. \"We think there is enormous opportunity here.\" Americans for Prosperity brought its \"Failing Agenda\" bus tour to suburban cities in Colorado's heavily populated Front Range.\n                \n                    \n                    Kirk Siegler/KUNC\n                    \n                \nhide caption Americans for Prosperity brought its \"Failing Agenda\" bus tour to suburban cities in Colorado's heavily populated Front Range. In Colorado this week, Americans for Prosperity wasn't just on the airwaves. The group \u2014 and Phillips \u2014 brought its \"Failing Agenda\" bus tour to suburban cities up and down the state's heavily populated Front Range. The group said the tour was meant to highlight what it says are Obama's failed economic policies. Turnout at the group's event at a park in the south Denver suburb of Centennial was modest. Organizers grumbled because the city wouldn't allow their bus to be parked at the venue itself because the required permits hadn't been secured, leading to some perhaps requisite jokes about excess government regulation. At least one heckler, who appeared to have been at the park with his children already, shouted pro-Obama words as the event was beginning. The Obama campaign itself has criticized Americans for Prosperity and the Koch brothers for promoting an agenda that Democrats say would put the interests of corporations in front of progress made on clean energy and environmental protections. In a statement, DNC spokesman Patrick Rodenbush went further: \"This bus tour, funded by the Koch brothers, is just another example of wealthy individuals seeking to buy the election for Mitt Romney to protect their own special interests instead of the middle class,\" he said.

Romney says it is possible to cut tax rates without driving the government deeper into the red, and that he can make up for the lost revenue by closing tax loopholes. But analysts have had a hard time testing Romney's claim because he hasn't offered many specifics. When he was pressed by NBC's David Gregory this weekend to give an example of a loophole he would close, Romney didn't offer much detail. It's a general rule of politics ... that politicians promise all things to all people and never promise pain unless their back is to a wall. Bruce Bartlett, author of The Benefit and the Burden \"Well, I can tell you that people at the high end \u2014 high-income taxpayers \u2014 will have fewer deductions and exemptions,\" Romney said. That's not good enough for President Obama, who says Romney's plan lacks a basic ingredient: math. \"When you ask them, well, 'How are you going to do it?' \u2014 well, they won't answer real clearly,\" Obama said at a recent rally. \"But there are only a few ways of doing it, and most of them involve sticking it to the middle class.\" Obama often cites a study by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, which found that under Romney's plan, middle-class families would have to give up some of their popular tax breaks \u2014 like the deduction for mortgage interest \u2014 in order to offset the cost of cutting taxes for the rich. The authors said anything else is \"not mathematically possible.\" \"To an economist, those are very strong words,\" says Princeton economist Harvey Rosen. Rosen, a former adviser to George W. Bush, set out to prove Romney's critics wrong. \"Obviously, I'm a Republican,\" Rosen says, \"[and] it kind of raised my hackles slightly to see the proposal being characterized as 'mathematically impossible.' \" Rosen's study was similar to the Tax Policy Center's. He first looked at how much money the government would lose by lowering tax rates on the wealthy, then tried to figure out how much it could recoup by closing loopholes. Rosen came to the opposite conclusion: that you can cut tax rates for wealthy Americans without shifting costs onto the middle class. \"So it's not mathematically impossible,\" he says. Why the difference? Partly because the two studies make different assumptions about what tax loopholes might be on the chopping block. The Tax Policy Center assumes Romney would not want to eliminate tax breaks designed to encourage savings and investment, like IRAs and tax-exempt government bonds. Rosen, however, assumes some of those breaks could be phased out. Of course, Rosen says Romney could easily settle this debate, simply by spelling out which tax loopholes he'd do away with. \"We wouldn't have to be guessing,\" he says. \"But the kind of specificity that an academic might think is very cool might not make sense for a politician.\" In fact, Romney is following a well-worn political path. Bruce Bartlett, author of The Benefit and the Burden, a book on tax policy, says politicians are typically much more specific about the benefits of the tax cuts they're proposing than the burden of the loopholes they want to close. \"It's a general rule of politics, dating back to at least Cicero, that politicians promise all things to all people and never promise pain unless their back is to a wall,\" Bartlett says. In fairness, Obama has been equally vague in discussing his own plans for tax reform. He agrees with most policy experts that a tax code with lower rates and fewer loopholes would be more efficient. But like Romney, he hasn't spelled out which loopholes he'd cut. Bartlett says that omission is less glaring in the president's case. \"Obama has not made tax reform, by any stretch of the imagination, the centerpiece of his campaign,\" he says. \"Whereas I think it would be hard for people off the top of their heads to say what else Mitt Romney stands for.\" For now, tax analysts and voters will just have to keep guessing about how Romney's plan would work, and decide whether they trust the candidate to fill in the details after the election.",

They and other independent fact checkers have compiled, just as they did at last week's Republican National Convention, a list of those things said by the two parties' standard bearers that don't quite add up or may give misleading impressions. Our colleague Mark Stencel has already gone through one story told several times Thursday \u2014 about President Obama's mother and the struggles she had with her insurance company as she was dying of cancer. He concludes that the president and other speakers \"did not specify that the insurance issue was her disability claim, not her health coverage as the story still suggests to many listeners.\" As for what the watchdogs are saying, here's a sampling: -- FactCheck begins its report by noting that Obama \"boasted that his plan would cut the deficit by $4 trillion over 10 years, citing 'independent experts.' But one such analyst called a key element of the plan a 'gimmick.' \" It takes issue with Biden for quoting Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney as saying \"it's not worth moving heaven and earth\" to catch Osama bin Laden. \"Actually,\" FactCheck writes, \"Romney said he would target more than just 'one person.' \" Biden also gets knocked for saying Romney \"believes it's OK to raise taxes on middle classes by $2,000.\" Actually, FactCheck writes, Romney \"promises to lower middle-class taxes.\" And FactCheck notes that when the president quoted Romney as saying it was \"tragic\" to \"end the war in Iraq,\" he didn't mention that \"Romney was criticizing was the pace of Obama's troop withdrawal, not ending a war.\" -- The Associated Press kicks off its fact-checking by writing that \"President Barack Obama laid claim to a peace dividend that doesn't exist when he told the nation he wants to use money saved by ending wars to build highways, schools and bridges. The wars were largely financed by borrowing, so there is no ready pile of cash to be diverted to anything else.\" The AP also takes issue with a figure cited by Biden and many others \u2014 that \"after the worst job loss since the Great Depression, we've created 4.5 million private sector jobs in the past 29 months.\" The wire service notes that: \"This seems to be a favorite statistic, because many speakers at the convention cited it. But it's misleading \u2014 a figure that counts jobs from when the recession reached its trough and employment began to grow again. It excludes jobs lost earlier in Obama's term, and masks the fact that joblessness overall has risen over Obama's term so far. ... Overall, some 7.5 million jobs were lost during the recession that began in December 2007 in President George W. Bush's term and ended officially in June 2009 with Obama as president.\" -- PolitiFact isn't accusing the president of any whoppers. It gives him a \"half true\" rating for saying that he's got a plan that \"independent analysis\" has said will cut the deficit by $4 trillion. But, says PolitiFact: \"We found that the 'independent' source that supports that claim is a liberal think tank. Another group, one that puts a premium on deficit reduction, gives the president credit for moving in the right direction but thinks he won't get as far as he says he will. They think the president's plan might get close to the $3 trillion mark, but not $4 trillion.\" PolitiFact gives Obama a \"mostly true\" rating for his line that because Romney referred to Russia as the nation's No. 1 enemy, the GOP nominee is \"still stuck in a Cold War mind warp.\" According to PolitiFact: \"Romney didn't use those exact words, but he did refer to Russia as 'without question our No. 1 geopolitical foe.' He said the Russians 'fight for every cause for the world's worst actors' in a CNN interview. In a later interview, however, Romney softened his language, this time calling Russia our 'No. 1 adversary' in terms of U.N. votes and emphasized it's not an enemy of the kind launching missiles at American shores.\" -- The Washington Post's The Fact Checker is taking issue with Biden for charging that Romney was willing to \"let Detroit [the automakers, that is] go bankrupt.\" The Fact Checker writes that: \"This statement is drawn from a headline \u2014 'Let Detroit Go Bankrupt' \u2014 on an opinion article written by Romney for The New York Times. But he did not say that in the article. \"In the article, Romney argued that if the automakers 'get the bailout that their chief executives asked for yesterday, you can kiss the American automotive industry goodbye. It won't go overnight, but its demise will be virtually guaranteed.' \"As Romney put it, 'Detroit needs a turnaround, not a check.' \" All the posts we've done about what the fact checkers said during the conventions are collected here.

            "article_content": "A look back at President Obama's road to Thursday night's re-nomination at the Democratic National Convention.  ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: This is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. I'm Robert Siegel. Four years ago, then-Senator Barack Obama took the stage in Denver to accept his party's presidential nomination. He spoke of overcoming partisanship and economic turmoil. Well, tonight, President Obama will do it again with four years of experience under his belt. Since taking office, he has struggled to overcome a crushing recession, a weak recovery and a deeply divided electorate. NPR's Scott Horsley has this story on the path the president has traveled. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Barack Obama burst onto the national stage at another Democratic convention, eight years ago. What most people remember from that speech was the Illinois Senate candidate's passionate appeal for an end to partisan bickering. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: There is not a liberal America and a conservative America. There is the United States of America. (APPLAUSE) HORSLEY: People heard that as a call for political cooperation, but there's a collective economic message as well: that we're all in this together. Mr. Obama argued then and now that making sure prosperity is broadly shared is good for business, while a top-heavy economy in which only the wealthy prosper is inherently unstable. OBAMA: Our economy is strongest when our middle class grows and opportunity is spread as widely as possible. HORSLEY: That was a speech that candidate Obama gave in early 2008, in which he outlined proposals for middle class tax breaks, consumer protections in the mortgage market, government investment in roads and renewable energy, and health care reform. Sound familiar? AUSTAN GOOLSBEE: If you go back and look at that speech, it really was the now president outlining his view of what drives the economy. HORSLEY: University of Chicago economist Austan Goolsbee was a senior advisor to the 2008 campaign and later worked in the Obama White House. GOOLSBEE: It wasn't a top down thing. It was fundamentally based on a broader-based growth and prosperity as being the only sustainable kind of economic growth. HORSLEY: This was a month before the Bear Stearns meltdown and seven months before Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy. Mr. Obama was talking about a decades-long erosion of the middle class. But a financial tsunami was just about to hit. By the time he took office, the economy was in freefall. The president and Congressional Democrats rushed through a massive stimulus bill that suddenly pumped hundreds of billions of dollars into the kinds of programs Mr. Obama had been talking about for years. That spring, the president paused to explain why it made sense for the government to borrow and spend money when families and businesses were doing the opposite. OBAMA: If every family in America, if every business in America cuts back all at once, then no one is spending any money, which means there are no customers, which means there are more layoffs, which means that the economy gets even worse. That's why the government has to step in and temporarily boost spending in order to stimulate demand. HORSLEY: This classic Keynesian economics is somewhat counter-intuitive, and by his own admission, Mr. Obama didn't do a good enough job of selling it. Republicans had a simpler, bumper sticker argument, that government spending is the problem. While the mainstream consensus is that the stimulus did cushion the recession's blow, it didn't go far enough. And every monthly jobs report has turned into a referendum on Mr. Obama's policies, including the one that's due out tomorrow. If the stimulus was controversial, the president's health care overhaul was even more so. UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTERS: (Chanting) Kill the bill! Kill the bill! Kill... HORSLEY: The combination of a weak economy and an unpopular health-care law, produced a political shellacking for the president's party in the 2010 elections. For the first time, Mr. Obama was forced to negotiate with the newly-empowered Republicans in Congress. OBAMA: This is a big, diverse country. Not everybody agrees with us. I know that shocks people. HORSLEY: Liberals were furious in late 2010 when Mr. Obama reluctantly agreed to extend Bush-era tax cuts for the wealthy. They accused the president of caving in, rewarding GOP obstructionism. Mr. Obama defended the unemployment benefits and payroll tax cut he won in return, and tried to present himself as the reasonable man in Washington. OBAMA: In order to get stuff done, we're going to compromise. HORSLEY: But in fact, there was almost no compromise in the following year, despite months of fruitless negotiation on a grand bargain to reduce the deficit. Republicans repeatedly walked away from the talks rather than accept higher taxes on the wealthy. The standoff ultimately cost the government its triple-A bond rating. OBAMA: I've been left at the altar now a couple of times. And I think that, you know, one of the questions that the Republican Party is going to have to ask itself is: Can they say yes to anything? HORSLEY: By this time last year, Mr. Obama had given up trying to bargain with Republicans. Instead, he declared he would make his case directly to the American people. And that's what he's been trying to do for most of the last 12 months. OBAMA: This isn't about class warfare. This is about the nation's welfare. It's about making choices that benefit not just the people who've done fantastically well over the last few decades, but that benefits the middle class. HORSLEY: Unable to find common ground with today's Republicans, Mr. Obama repeatedly aligns himself with GOP leaders from a more cooperative era; noting it was Eisenhower who built the Interstate Highway System, Nixon who launched the EPA, and Ronald Reagan, who despite his airbrushed image, agreed to raise taxes to combat a yawning budget deficit. OBAMA: It is this shared vision that I intend to carry forward in this century as president because it is a vision that has worked for the American middle class and everybody who is striving to get into the middle class. (APPLAUSE) HORSLEY: The fact that the president still talking about the same ideas to help the middle class, three-and-a-half years into office, could be seen as an admission that so far he's fallen short. But on the campaign trail in Iowa last week, Marilyn Wadden said she appreciates Mr. Obama's consistency. MARILYN WADDEN: His website says the same thing now as it did four years ago, and that's a wonderful thing. He's working on everything - ticking them off one by one. And had he had a Congress who was more supportive, we would have gotten a lot more done. HORSLEY: While Mr. Obama has struggled with the economy, one of his biggest successes came in national security. And here again, it was something he'd promised to do four years ago: send U.S. troops into Pakistan if the leader of al-Qaida were found there. OBAMA: Tonight, I can report to the American people and to the world that the United States has conducted an operation that killed Osama bin Laden, the leader of al-Qaida. HORSLEY: That night, as a crowd gathered outside the White House to celebrate bin Laden's death, Mr. Obama asked Americans to remember the sense of unity they felt in wake of the 9/11 attacks, a feeling he said had frayed in the years since. Mr. Obama has always talked about restoring a sense of common purpose to the country. He's called the November election a chance for Americans to end the stalemate in Washington. Polls suggest, however, that stalemate extends far beyond the nation's capital. Eight years after a young Senate candidate declared an end to Red America and Blue America, the United States of America is as divided as ever. Scott Horsley, NRP news, Charlotte.

President Obama won't be giving the speech he might wish to give tonight. All presidents accepting their party's renomination seek to shift from a message of hope and change to one of progress and accomplishment. Although Obama will certainly talk up the highlights of his term, he won't want to sound triumphant \u2014 not with a jobs report due tomorrow that's expected to show a 43rd straight month of U.S. unemployment above 8 percent. \"In an acceptance situation, you want to paint a bright picture of all the wonderful things that have happened over the past four years,\" says Martin Medhurst, a professor of political science and rhetoric at Baylor University. \"While good things have happened, the economic picture is such that he'll be hard-pressed to paint a terribly bright picture,\" he says. Obama's other main task \u2014 aside from knocking his opponent, Republican Mitt Romney \u2014 will be convincing voters that another four years in office will lead to greater things. \"He's got to remind people that he's done a tremendous amount and the best is yet to come,\" says Minneapolis Mayor R.T. Rybak, a vice chairman of the Democratic National Committee. Rybak points to accomplishments Obama is likely to tout: bailing out the domestic auto industry, expanding health coverage for millions of Americans, reshaping the student loan business, ending the war in Iraq and winding down the one in Afghanistan, and green-lighting the mission that killed Osama bin Laden. \"He's delivered and is going to deliver a lot more than Mitt Romney can ever dream of doing,\" Rybak says. As has been the case throughout the Democratic convention and the campaign as a whole, attacks on Romney's platform will certainly be a hallmark of Obama's speech. \"Both of them have to savage their opponent,\" says George C. Edwards III, a presidential scholar at Texas A&M University who has written a book about Obama's leadership titled Overreach. \"Obama has to frame the election as a choice, not a referendum [on his own record] \u2014 'I'm better than the other guy,' \" Edwards says. Obama will seek to raise doubts and fears about what a Romney administration would look like, arguing above all that it would imperil the middle class. And he'll be taking a page or two from the 1936 renomination acceptance speech of Franklin D. Roosevelt, Baylor's Medhurst suggests. Seeking a second term in the face of continuing depression and tremendously high unemployment, Roosevelt argued that the \"economic royalists\" in the Republican Party favored the rich, while he was for the little guy. That fall, Roosevelt went on to win every state but Maine and Vermont. \"That's exactly the stance Obama is going to have to take,\" Medhurst says, \"that he stands for the middle class and Romney is for the rich people.\" Raising the stakes by painting a dire picture of a Romney presidency may be enough to prod the Democratic base, which has been noticeably less energized about this election than it was about Obama's run four years ago. \"I don't think he can recapture the magic of 2008 \u2014 no president can,\" says David Woodard, a Republican consultant who teaches at Clemson University. \"But he has to make them feel he can lead them to victory.\" Obama also has to speak to those other potential supporters who are disillusioned but might still be won over. Romney and other Republicans sought at their convention last week to portray Obama as a well-intentioned man who has failed, so that voters will not feel bad about booting out a personally popular president. \"He's been president for four years, and I'm not sure the average person right now could answer the question, 'What does Barack Obama want to do in a second term that would have a better result?' \" says Gary Bauer, chairman of the Campaign for Working Families, a conservative political action committee. The theme of the Democratic National Convention has been \"Forward.\" Obama has to answer the question, \"Forward to what?\" \"The challenge for Obama is that he needs to put out, much more than he has, a strong vision for what he wants to do in a second term,\" says Michael Waldman, a former speechwriter for President Bill Clinton and president of the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University's law school. \"Not an imaginary vision of what he would do if Democrats had all the power,\" Waldman adds, \"but, realistically, what people could expect from him if elected for a second term.\"",

            "article_content": "On the second night of the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, N.C., former President Bill Clinton made a rousing case for President Barack Obama to be re-elected to a second term. Clinton went through all the GOP arguments \u2014 answering each charge.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: It's MORNING EDITION, from NPR News. I'm Steve Inskeep. Good morning. Renee Montagne is back at NPR West. Renee, welcome back. RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: Thank you very much. After a nice vacation, and so glad to be here, because big news: President Obama speaks to the Democratic Convention tonight. Just as with Mitt Romney last week, the president will have a huge audience to make his case. INSKEEP: Four years ago in Colorado, the Obama campaign put their man in an outdoor stadium filled with tens of thousands of supporters. A plan to repeat that in Charlotte was called off due to possible thunderstorms. The president will speak indoors at the arena where the rest of the convention is held. MONTAGNE: Last night, former President Bill Clinton offered a passionate argument for returning Barack Obama to office. Bill Clinton was the star of the night, a night that also offered a few surprises, as NPR's Mara Liasson reports. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Day two of the Democratic Convention delivered some news that wasn't in the original script. On Tuesday, the Democrats had adopted a platform that dropped a reference to Jerusalem as the capitol of Israel and the use of the word God - as in God-given potential. Both had been in the 2008 platform. After Republicans and some Jewish groups protested, and at the urging of President Obama, the 2008 language was restored last night, but not until the convention floor had taken three voice votes, the outcome of which was unclear. With that controversy awkwardly resolved, it was on to the task at hand: eviscerating Mitt Romney and promoting Barack Obama. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) ELIZABETH WARREN: The Republican vision is clear: I've got mine. The rest of you are on your own. LIASSON: Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts Senate candidate and the godmother   of the new Consumer Finance Protection Agency, told the Democrats that for many years, the middle class had been chipped, squeezed and hammered. People feel the system is rigged, she said, and they're right. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) WARREN: Billionaires pay lower tax rates than their secretaries. And Wall Street CEOs, the same ones who wrecked our economy and destroyed millions of jobs, still strut around Congress, no shame, demanding favors, and acting like we should thank them. Does anyone here have a problem with that? Yeah, well, I do, too. LIASSON: Warren is a hero to the liberal grassroots base of the Democratic Party. But she's been struggling as a retail politician in Massachusetts. Even in that deep blue state with Barack Obama on the top of the ticket, she's been running behind the incumbent Republican, Scott Brown. Last night, Warren delivered a fiery populist attack on Romney and Paul Ryan for a budget that she said would, quote, \"pulverize financial reform, voucherize Medicare and vaporize Obamacare.\" But Barack Obama, Warren declared, believes in a country where everyone is held accountable. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) WARREN: Where no one can steal your purse on Main Street or your pension on Wall Street. President Obama believes in a country where we invest in education, in roads and bridges, in science and in the future, so we can create new opportunities so the next kid can make it big, and the kid after that, and the kid after that. That's what president Obama believes. LIASSON: After Warren, came the main event of the evening. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON: We are here to nominate a president, and I've got one in mind. LIASSON: It was the first time a former president had placed the name of an incumbent in nomination. And Bill Clinton jumped right into a rebuttal of the Republican's argument. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) CLINTON: In Tampa a few days ago, we heard a lot of talk, oh, about how the president and the Democrats don't really believe in free enterprise and individual initiative, how we want everybody to be dependent on the government, how bad we are for the economy. This Republican narrative, its alternative universe says that every one of us in this room who amounts to anything, we're all completely self-made. LIASSON: Every politician wants you to believe he was born in a log cabin that he built himself, Clinton said, but it ain't so. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) CLINTON: We Democrats, we think the country works better with a strong middle class, with real opportunities for poor folks to work their way into it, with a relentless focus on the future, with business and government actually working together to promote growth and broadly shared prosperity. You see, we believe that we're all in this together is a far better philosophy than you're on your own. LIASSON: Clinton went through all the Republican's arguments, answering each charge on welfare, health care and the assertion that President Obama has cut $716 billion from Medicare. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) CLINTON: Now, when Congressman Ryan looked into that TV camera and attacked President Obama's Medicare savings as, quote, \"the biggest, coldest power play,\" I don't know whether to laugh or cry, because that $716 billion is exactly, to the dollar, the same amount of Medicare savings that he had in his own budget. You got to get one thing: It takes some brass to attack a guy for doing what you did. LIASSON: It was vintage Clinton: long, almost 50 minutes, mixing policy details and folksy humor and fueled by a conviction that if he just keeps talking, he can win over every last member of the audience. Here's how Clinton set up the choice in this election. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) CLINTON: In Tampa, the Republican argument against the president reelection was actually pretty simple, pretty snappy. It went something like this: We left him a total mess. He hadn't cleaned it up fast enough, so fire him and put us back in. LIASSON: But, Clinton said, there's an alternative. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) CLINTON: I like the argument for President Obama's reelection a lot better. Here it is: He inherited a deeply damaged economy. He put a floor under the crash. He began the long, hard road to recovery and laid the foundation for a modern, more well-balanced economy that will produce millions of good new jobs. LIASSON: But that's an aspirational argument, and the Republicans are quick to point out that President Obama has not produced those millions of good new jobs yet. President Clinton had an answer for that, too. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) CLINTON: Are we where we want to be today? No. Is the president satisfied? Of course not. But are we better off than we were when he took office? UNIDENTIFIED GROUP: Yes. LIASSON: The answer is yes, Clinton said, but he knows how hard that argument is to make with 8.3 percent unemployment and $16 trillion in debt. So Clinton kept trying, acknowledging that Americans have yet to feel the improvement. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) CLINTON: No president - not me, not any of my predecessors - no one could have fully repaired all the damage that he found in just four years. But he has laid the foundations for a new, modern, successful economy, a shared prosperity. And if you will renew the president's contract, you will feel it. You will feel it. Folks, whether the American people believe what I just said or not may be the whole election. I just want you to know that I believe it. With all my heart, I believe it. LIASSON: Mr. Clinton was talking to the larger audience watching on television, but inside the arena, delegates were thrilled. Clementine Bass of Pine Bluff, Arkansas would have been happy to hear him talk for another 50 minutes. CLEMENTINE BASS: Oh, I loved it. I mean, it was like we were home and he was telling us a story, and it was very vivid. I enjoyed it. I really did. LIASSON: Then President Obama walked onto the stage. The two presidents embraced. That was the point of the evening, to link the memories of Bill Clinton's record of peace and prosperity to President Obama, and to see if some of the former president's remarkable popularity can transfer to the man who gets to make his own case for a second term tonight.

Just as they did during the Republican National Convention, independent fact checkers spent the first day of the Democratic National Convention listening for claims that don't add up \u2014 and found them. -- FactCheck.org says it heard \"a number of dubious or misleading claims\" from the Democrats who spoke on stage Tuesday in Charlotte, N.C. Among the problems it found: \u2014 \"The keynote speaker and others claimed the Republican presidential nominee, Mitt Romney, would raise taxes on the 'middle class.' He has promised he won't. Democrats base their claim on a study that doesn't necessarily lead to that conclusion.\" -- \"The keynote speaker, San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro, also said there have been 4.5 million 'new jobs' under Obama. The fact is the economy has regained only 4 million of the 4.3 million jobs lost since Obama took office.\" -- \"A Democratic governor said Romney 'left his state 47th out of 50 in job growth.' Actually, Massachusetts went from 50th in job creation during Romney's first year to 28th in his final year.\" -- \"Multiple speakers repeated a claim that the Ryan/Romney Medicare plan would cost seniors $6,400 a year. That's a figure that applied to Ryan's 2011 budget plan, but his current proposal (the one Romney embraces) is far more generous.\" -- The Washington Post's The Fact Checker cites some of the same problems as FactCheck highlighted. And it points to this statement from Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada: \"We learned that he [Mitt Romney] pays a lower tax rate than middle-class families.\" The Fact Checker writes that: \"For all the rhetoric about high taxes in the United States, most Americans pay a relatively small percentage of their income in taxes. Romney had an effective rate of 13.9 percent in 2010 and 15.4 percent in 2011. That gives him a higher rate than 80 percent of taxpayers if only taxes on a tax return are counted and puts him just about in the middle of all taxpayers if payroll taxes paid by employers are included.\" -- PolitiFact appears to have just begun its analysis. In its initial take on the night's talk, it gives Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick a \"half true\" rating for his statement about the state being \"47th in the nation in job creation\" when Romney left office there. As for first lady Michelle Obama's address to the convention, the fact checkers don't seem to have any faults to find. You can find all our posts about fact checks of the Republican and Democratic conventions here. Note at 11:55 a.m. ET: Earlier, we included a reference to FactCheck.org's analysis of comments made by Rep. James Clyburn of South Carolina. The analysis, it turns out, was based on Clyburn's prepared remarks \u2014 and he has yet to deliver them. So we've removed that paragraph from the post above.",

            "article_content": "First Lady Michelle Obama was one of the stars on the first night of the Democratic National Convention. She delivered a ringing, impassioned plea for the re-election of her husband, President Barack Obama.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: It's MORNING EDITION from NPR News. I'm Steve Inskeep. DAVID GREENE, HOST: And I'm David Greene. The Democratic National Convention opened last night in Charlotte. INSKEEP: Democrats offered blistering attacks on Mitt Romney and a vigorous defense of President Obama's record. GREENE: There were appeals to women voters, Hispanics, young people, and military families. INSKEEP: And there was an appeal to win over black people who voted for the president four years ago and have been disappointed since. Here's NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Republicans say the president can't run on his record and Mr. Obama even gave himself an incomplete on the economy when asked to grade himself in a television interview on Monday. But last night there were no apologies or incompletes given at the Democratic Convention, where speaker after speaker offered a full-throated defense of the president's accomplishments. The keynote speaker was Julian Castro, the 37-year-old mayor of San Antonio, Texas. (SOUNDBITE OF CONVENTION SPEECH) LIASSON: President Obama needs a huge turnout of Hispanic voters to win battleground states like Nevada, Colorado and Florida - and Castro was the perfect messenger, delivering an inspiring personal story and painting a portrait of Mitt Romney as clueless and out of touch. Romney just doesn't get it, Castro said. (SOUNDBITE OF CONVENTION SPEECH) LIASSON: Castro predicted Romney's economic plan would, quote, \"dismantle the middle class.\" Other speakers were just as harsh. (SOUNDBITE OF CONVENTION SPEECH) LIASSON: That's Nancy Keenan, president of NARAL, the abortion rights group. If Republicans were reluctant to talk about social issues at their convention last week, the Democrats had no such hesitation. It was clear they think that gay marriage and abortion are issues that will help fire up their base in an election where motivation counts for   more than persuasion. (SOUNDBITE OF CONVENTION SPEECH) LIASSON: There were speakers from a list of targeted voting groups - young families who'd been helped by the Affordable Care Act, a mom who has four children in four different branches of the military. She thanked the Obamas for helping military families. Congressional candidate Tammy Duckworth, who lost both legs in Iraq, attacked Romney for failing to mention U.S. troops fighting overseas in his convention speech. (SOUNDBITE OF CONVENTION SPEECH) LIASSON: Former Ohio governor Ted Strickland gave a stem-winder of a speech, praising President Obama as someone who, quote, \"knows our struggles.\" On the other hand, Strickland said... (SOUNDBITE OF CONVENTION SPEECH) LIASSON: Strickland, an ordained minister, was probably the first politician to  attack  Romney's overseas bank accounts while quoting the Bible. : Mitt has so little economic patriotism that even his money needs a passport. It summers on the beaches of the Cayman Islands and winters on the slopes of the Swiss Alps. In Matthew - in Matthew Chapter Six, Verse 21, the Scriptures teach us that where your treasure is, there will your heart be also. LIASSON: The barrage of attacks on Romney stopped when first lady Michelle Obama came out on stage. She gave a powerful personal speech about the president. (SOUNDBITE OF CONVENTION SPEECH) LIASSON: Mrs. Obama never mentioned Mitt Romney's name, but the critique of Romney was implicit. (SOUNDBITE OF CONVENTION SPEECH) LIASSON: Mrs. Obama is more popular than her husband. Her work on non-controversial issues like nutrition, obesity and military families have kept her above the political fray and given her a standing the campaign hopes she can transfer to the president. And last night she connected Mr. Obama's personal story to the argument for giving him a second term. (SOUNDBITE OF CONVENTION SPEECH) LIASSON: Mrs. Obama wove the lessons she said she and the president had learned from their parents into a veiled rejoinder to last week's Republican attacks. (SOUNDBITE OF CONVENTION SPEECH) LIASSON: Mrs. Obama's speech was a good example of the benefits of holding your convention after the other party. The Democrats will continue having the last word tonight when another powerful validator speaks for Mr. Obama - former President Bill Clinton. Mara Liasson, NPR News, Charlotte. INSKEEP: Now, President Obama is expected to speak on Thursday, formally accepting another nomination for the White House. That speech was to take place outdoors in a football stadium before a crowd of more than 70,000, but we're told the possibility of severe weather has forced a change of plans. The president will now speak indoors to a much smaller audience, in the same arena where his wife spoke on Tuesday night. It's MORNING EDITION from NPR News. Copyright \u00a9 2012 NPR.

            "article_content": "Elizabeth Warren takes the podium during prime time at the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, N.C., Wednesday. A new poll has Warren trailing in her bid to unseat Republican Scott Brown for Ted Kennedy's Senate seat.  DAVID GREENE, HOST: Elizabeth Warren takes the podium during primetime at the Democratic National Convention this evening in Charlotte. Warren is a law professor-turned-government watchdog who's now running for the Senate in Massachusetts. As NPR's Yuki Noguchi reports, Warren is a crusader who's won loyal friends and made some fierce enemies throughout her career. YUKI NOGUCHI, BYLINE: The central tenet of Elizabeth Warren's life story, both personal and professional, revolves around economic hardship. ELIZABETH WARREN: I grew up on the ragged edge of the middle class, and I know it's hard out there. NOGUCHI: She was born in Oklahoma City to a maintenance man and a receptionist, whose misfortunes included losing their car after not being able to afford their payments. Warren's ticket to college was a debate scholarship she won at 16. She followed her first husband to Houston and became a speech therapist. Later, after law school, she practiced as an attorney out of her home while taking care of her two young children. Her research on bankruptcy and predatory lending led her to a law professorship at Harvard, where she eventually crossed paths with a young Barack Obama. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: She's a dear friend of mine. She's somebody I've known since I was in law school. NOGUCHI: And she has a penchant for pithy comparisons. She's likened the bankruptcy system to a hospital emergency room, a place of last resort for people in trouble. And as chair of the Congressional Oversight Panel of the financial crisis bailouts, she framed her argument for the creation of a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau this way. WARREN: You can't buy a toaster in America that has a one-in-five chance of exploding. But you can buy a mortgage that has a one-in-five chance of exploding, and they don't even have to tell you about it. NOGUCHI: Liberals, including \"The Daily Show's\" Jon Stewart, swooned. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"THE DAILY SHOW\") NOGUCHI: But she elicited an equal and opposite response from Republicans, who considered her activist approach an overreach of government. She frequently tangled on Capitol Hill, here in March of last year with New Jersey congressman Scott Garrett. REPRESENTATIVE SCOTT GARRETT: What legal authority does a political appointee have in a situation like this, making recommendations with regard to either civil or criminal actions? WARREN: Congressman, I think we need cops on the beat to enforce the law. GARRETT: Great, but we need to know what that law is. Can you cite - can you cite what the authority is to enforce that law that you have? WARREN: We need... NOGUCHI: Warren also regularly sparred with Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, publicly over handling of the bailout, and privately over his reported opposition to her leading the new consumer bureau. Now, a new poll has Warren trailing in her bid to unseat Republican Scott Brown for Ted Kennedy's Senate seat. Her missteps included not responding, for weeks, after she was accused of using her Cherokee heritage to advance her academic career. Speaking yesterday to NPR, Warren said this race is not about her. WARREN: This is about what's happening to America's working families. That's an issue I've been working on for years. NOGUCHI: And it's one that appeals to her liberal Democratic base, whose energy the Obama campaign needs badly heading into the fall. Yuki Noguchi, NPR News, Charlotte, North Carolina.

There were a lot of preliminaries, but it was Michelle Obama's show Tuesday night at the Democratic National Convention, and she used it masterfully \u2014 carrying a rapt crowd along with a narrative of family, hard work, and truth-telling. Largely wrung of politics, the first lady's speech plotted parallels in her life and that of her husband, President Obama. She pointedly tracked their humble beginnings and strivings in an unspoken but clear contrast to the privileged upbringing of GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney. And, in a calculated aside, designed surely to address Republican criticisms that her husband does not celebrate success, she said this of his, and her, families: \"They didn't begrudge anyone else's success or care that others had much more than they did. In fact, they admired it.\" It was a speech that those who follow the first lady say was largely a stump standard, but with extra ruffles and flourishes \u2014 family anecdotes and some humor. The polished and popular Obama \u2014 her national approval rating is above 65 percent \u2014 has become her husband's best campaign surrogate, humanizing him, as Ann Romney did for her husband last week, with stories of their daughters, and their broke early dating and marriage years. \"We were so young, so in love, so in debt,\" she said, adding that their combined monthly student loan bill was higher than their mortgage. Though she didn't directly address her husband's opponent, or the bitter battle Romney and her husband are waging, Obama took direct aim at what some Democrats claim were lies embedded in messages that emanated from the Republican National Convention last week. Growing up, she said, she and \"Barack\" learned from their families dignity, decency and that \"the truth matters.\" It was one of her biggest applause lines. The connection with the middle and striving classes, the struggles raising children with a semblance of normalcy, of being young and in love \u2014 and still in love. And of considering her most important title \"mom in chief.\" \"For Barack, success isn't about how much money you make, it's about the difference you make in people's lives,\" she said. That was all part of Obama's imperative Tuesday. She appeared twice to tear up, talking about family and of going forward. But it was her get-out-the-vote rally cry, a plea for four more years because, as \"Barack\" says, \"we've got so much more to do,\" that will perhaps have more long-term resonance. That and a character reference from someone who says she had some misgivings four years ago about what the presidency would do to her husband, her children, a life she had built and loved. \"Being president,\" she said, \"doesn't change who you are, it reveals who you are,\" a sentiment that struck some in attendance. \"When she said the presidency doesn't change a man, it reveals him \u2014 that was a very powerful message,\" said Dan Lankilde, state Democratic chairman of American Samoa. It was the same message that resonated with Pat Jones, a Pennsylvania delegate. \"I believe that \u2014 the president hasn't changed. She emphasized the vision. I believe in that vision.\"",

            "article_content": "The Democratic National Convention is a chance for President Obama to fire up his base, reach out to independent voters and try to erase the messages put out last week at the Republican convention.  The horse race, meanwhile, is stuck where its been for months: Romney and Obama are tied with any lead well within the margin of error.  DAVID GREENE, HOST: It's MORNING EDITION, from NPR News. Good morning. I'm David Greene. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: And I'm Steve Inskeep. Democrats hold their convention this week. And yesterday on this program, we heard one version of the challenge President Obama will face. Cokie Roberts said the president will need to talk of more than President Bush's failures and Mitt Romney's tax returns. He will face the challenge of defending his own record and speaking of what he'd do in four more years. Plenty of Democrats have advice, as we hear from NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: President Obama comes to Charlotte with a lot to do. He has to drive the contrast with Romney, convince voters to stay the course, even though he himself admits he hasn't accomplished all he wanted. And, says Democratic strategist Saul Shorr, the president needs to lay out for voters what he'd do in a second term. SAUL SHORR: I think they understand his priorities of rebuilding the middle class, investing in education, caring about infrastructure. But I think that's the purpose of the convention, which is to crystallize all of this and lay out the path for the future. And I think we'll all see that pretty clearly. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) LIASSON: At the CarolinaFest street fair yesterday, President Obama's grassroots might not have been as fired up as they were four years ago, but they are ready to go. And most of them are convinced the president emerged relatively unscathed from the lashing he got last week from the Republicans in Tampa. Brian Moran is the Democratic Party chair in the battleground state of Virginia. BRIAN MORAN: I think they doubled-down on their conservative, frankly, an extreme position, particularly with respect to women's rights and their platform adoption that would ban abortion, even in the cases of rape. I didn't hear any specifics with respect to an economic plan. So I'm not sure they did anything that would improve their position with respect to winning Virginia. LIASSON: Iowa is another key battleground state. It launched Barack Obama on his path to the White House five years ago. And Iowans will cast the very first votes in this election. Early voting there begins in three weeks, on September 27th. Iowa Democratic Chair Sue Dvorsky wants the president to talk about his record proudly. SUE DVORSKY: He has done some incredible stuff and historic stuff: this Supreme Court, the affordable health care, \"don't ask, don't tell,\" the auto industry. I want him to grab it, embrace it, own it and love it, because we do. And then I want him to remind everybody: So that's what's been done. You want to stop here, or you want to go backward? LIASSON: Part of Dvorsky's job is to reenergize all those young people on Iowa's college campuses. It's a lot harder this time, as the Republican vice presidential candidate Paul Ryan was only too happy to point out last week. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) DVORSKY: First of all, that was a clever line. But in Iowa, we have about 5 percent unemployment. We are doing better than the national average. That is not a message that resonates so well. What resonates about the Romney-Ryan thing in Iowa is Governor Romney's staffers talking about wind energy being a fad, when 20 percent of the energy in Iowa comes from wind. And the blades are made there. The towers are made there. The computers are made there. People are being trained in community colleges all over to do the maintenance. LIASSON: Romney wants to end tax credits for wind energy companies. The president wants to keep them. Then there's another difficult challenge for Mr. Obama: How to talk about an economy that's getting better, but not fast enough to make voters very hopeful. Yesterday, the Democrats struggled a bit with their answer to the basic question for an incumbent: Are Americans better off today than they were four years ago? Here's how Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley answered it on CBS' \"Face the Nation.\" (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"FACE THE NATION\") LIASSON: The Romney campaign wasted no time jumping on those comments. Paul Ryan was campaigning yesterday in the Democrats' backyard, on the campus of East Carolina University. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) LIASSON: Later in the day, Vice President Joe Biden tried to get his team back on message. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) LIASSON: As the Democratic convention begins, the horse race is stuck where it's been for months. Mitt Romney and Barack Obama are neck-and-neck with any lead well within the margin of error. Republicans got next to no national post-convention bounce, but there was some good news for the challenger. As the Democrats converged on Charlotte, the latest Elon University poll shows that here in North Carolina - where Barack Obama made history for the Democrats four years ago - Romney is up by four points.

Hong/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption A delegate shows off her button on the eve of the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, N.C. It's been a rough four years since Barack Obama accepted his party's nomination during a celebratory Denver convention that launched the freshman Illinois senator to the White House. Recovery from the worst economy since the Great Depression has been excruciatingly slow. The national unemployment rate has remained stubbornly above 8 percent. And partisanship has rendered Congress all but inoperable (and historically unpopular) under the nation's first African-American president, whose ephemeral message of hope and change has lost its resonance even among some of his most ardent supporters. As Democrats convene this week in Charlotte, N.C., to nominate Obama, 51, for a second term, the president will have what political analyst David Gergen characterized Monday as \"the most precious moment a political party gets\" \u2014 a prime-time conversation with the American people as the campaign heads into its final weeks. Obama comes into the convention in a dead heat race nationally with GOP nominee Mitt Romney, but with some advantages. Unchallenged in the primary season, he's got slim leads in most of the handful of swing states that will decide the election. He can pivot off Romney's convention of last week, which is viewed by many as only a partial success that resulted in little, if any, poll movement. And, unlike Romney, he doesn't have to make people like him, because they do \u2014 at least a lot more than they like Romney, according to polls. Obama has to outline a \"plausible scenario for why the country will be better off over the next four years\" if he's given a second term, political analyst Charlie Cook said Monday. It's the question Republicans have been pointedly asking, and one that Obama's surrogates have fumbled answering in recent days. The Obama campaign has already indicated it will focus on the middle class, and portraying Romney as rich and out of touch during the convention's three days. But, as Cook says, there has to be more than that. \"He has to provide a convincing argument to reintroduce hope,\" Cook told us Monday. \"They've got to at least have the hope in there for the second term.\" Rebut Romney Romney and the Republicans last week toned down their anti-Obama rhetoric, and, taking a page from the Karl Rove/Crossroads GPS focus group playbook, targeted their appeal to 2008 Obama voters who are now disillusioned. But in many ways, the Romney show in Tampa, Fla., fell short, even if one ignores the bizarre Clint Eastwood conversation with an empty chair. It provided Obama an opening. Here's how: Because the Obama campaign got the jump on defining Romney \u2014 who until April was still immersed in a bitter, ever rightward-moving primary campaign \u2014 the Republicans had to use their convention to erase the Democrats' branding, Gergen says. They did a good job, he says, but Romney's speech was long on humanization and short on substance. Now, Gergen says, Democrats can pivot to defining what Romney stands for, just as they early on defined his business record and hammered on his refusal to release many years of tax returns. The Obama campaign got started Monday when, on the eve of the convention, it released an ad running in swing states that claims Romney's tax plan would raise taxes on the middle class, while providing big tax cuts for the rich. Reinvigorate Voters Obama's message also has to target young voters and Latinos, who polls show are less excited about voting this year than four years ago. But what remains true is that Obama's sophisticated campaign operation, and Romney's inability to reach the \"comfort and trust\" threshold, have kept the president in the game, says Cook, the political analyst. The economic forecasting firm IHS Global Insight has accurately predicted 14 of the past 16 presidential elections based on a formula of two economic indicators plus three political variables. The firm's current prediction, using July's economic data? Obama would lose, with 45 percent of the vote. However, The Boston Globe this week quoted the head of IHS, Nigel Gault, as saying that other factors could play a role this year. \"Voters are not yet convinced the alternative to Obama is better,\" Gault told the Globe. As NBC's Domenico Montanaro put it Monday at a poll briefing in Charlotte: It's an economy vs. likability election. Romney's people may now be looking to the coming presidential debates to up their candidate's fortunes in that likability department. But his big shot for that came and went last week, Cook says. \"Debates are not the right venue for Romney to fix his problems.\" Obama and his campaign no doubt agree, and are looking at the coming three days to fix their own problems: recapturing some spirit of hope; and answering the question of how Americans are better off now than four years ago, and how they will be better with him as president four years from now. His challenge is to make the case that there was, and will be, more to his presidency than hope and change, and \u2014 as Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said derisively last week \u2014 \"thrill and pixie dust.\"",

Unlike what Republicans did in Tampa last week, Democrats will lay out a clear plan to get the country back on sound footing, Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa said during news briefing in Charlotte, N.C., moments ago. Villaraigosa, who is the chair of the Democratic National Convention, said that by the time the convention wraps up Thursday night, the party will have crystalized its platform and explained that this election is about a stark choice. It's a choice between \"a candidate who wants to build an economy from the middle out and a candidate who wants to build an economy from the top down,\" Villaraigosa. In a lot of ways, the opening press conference echoed the themes President Obama has talked about in recent interviews. To Time magazine, for example, Obama iterated that with enough explanation of his policies and the different approach that Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney would take, the American people would side with him. That's the point that National Commitee Secretary Alice Germond made during the media briefing. \"We are proud of our president and we are proud of what he's accomplished,\" she said. Taking a dig at what she said was the secrecy of the GOP platform, she said that by the time President Obama delivers his acceptance speech Thursday evening, everyone will have a copy of the platform. Villaraigosa said that the next few days were a time to remind the country about Obama's first term in office. He said they'll try to explain how Obama \"stopped an economic catastrophe\" and \"how he saved the auto industry\" and passed a landmark healthcare law. The Obama campaign's National Press Secretary Ben LaBolt was asked about a just-released Gallup poll that found Romney's acceptance speech was received tepidly by Americans. \"Most Americans are looking for an answer on how we're going to secure the middle class,\" LaBolt said. What they heard at the GOP convention was more \"recycled and debunked\" attacks against President Obama. \"We are going to use this convention to answer those questions,\" LaBolt added, \"and have an honest conversation about where we were in 2008.\" LaBolt also defended the president's record on economy. \"We've made progress,\" LaBolt said. And the president will use his speech on Thursday to lay out his plans to continue on that path.",

Among the things the Republican Party's presidential candidate is hearing this morning about the address he gave Thursday night is that \"in a speech heavy on anecdotal history but short on policy details, Mitt Romney avoided major falsehoods.\" Not exactly a ringing endorsement, but that analysis from the nonpartisan FactCheck.org is cheery compared to what the organization said about the acceptance speech that GOP vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan gave to the Republican National Convention on Wednesday. It contained \"several false claims and misleading statements,\" FactCheck concluded. (We rounded up the morning-after fact checks of Ryan's speech here and here.) Still, as with nearly all speeches given by candidates from both major parties, the fact checkers are finding fault with some of the things Romney said at the close of the GOP convention in Tampa: -- PolitiFact.com is giving Romney its \"pants on fire\" rating for saying that President Obama began his term in office with \"an apology tour.\" According to PolitiFact, \"a review of Obama's foreign travels and remarks during his early presidency showed no evidence to support such a blunt and disparaging claim.\" It has flagged Romney for that \"apology tour\" claim before, as have other fact checkers. -- Romney said \"let me make this very clear unlike President Obama, I will not raise taxes on the middle class.\" The Associated Press writes that, \"Obama has enacted several laws that could raise taxes for some middle-class families. Other Obama laws, however, have reduced taxes for many more such families.\" -- President Obama, according to Romney, has cut $716 billion from Medicare that will \"both hurt today's seniors, and depress innovation.\" But The Washington Post's Fact Checker says \"the savings mostly are wrung from health-care providers, not Medicare beneficiaries \u2014 who, as a result of the health-care law, ended up with new benefits for preventive care and prescription drugs.\" Romney's Medicare comment is another one that's been called false before. -- FactCheck.org, while saying Romney avoided major falsehoods, does say: \"We found a few bits of exaggeration and puffery. He exaggerated the loss in family income that has occurred under Obama, for example, including 13 months of losses that actually occurred before the president took office. And he made a back-handed accusation that Obama has raised taxes on middle-class taxpayers, when in fact the president has lobbied for and signed several temporary reductions.\" As we said at the top, though, the fact checkers aren't issuing alarming alerts about what Romney said. And they're also noting some of the claims he made that are very true. The AP, for instance, writes: \"Romney: 'President Obama promised to slow the rise of the oceans and to heal the planet.' \"The Facts: Really? \"Yes, pretty much. \"In a June 2008 speech marking his victory in the Democratic primaries, Obama said generations from now, 'we will be able to look back and tell our children that ... this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal.' \"",

            "article_content": "Mitt Romney has accepted the Republican Party's nomination for president \u2014 telling voters it was time to turn the page from the \"disappointing leadership\" of President Obama. Thursday night's speakers presented Romney as a man of faith and family with the business skills to turn the economy around.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: It's MORNING EDITION, from NPR News. I'm Steve Inskeep. DAVID GREENE, HOST: And I'm David Greene. During his acceptance speech last night at the Republican convention, Mitt Romney told a story about his father. He said his father gave his mother a rose every day, and left it by the bed. She found out he had died on the day the rose did not appear. INSKEEP: That was one of many moments in a speech designed to humanize the Republican candidate, and build a case against President Obama. And on the last night of the Republican convention in Tampa, almost everything went according to plan. Here's NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: For a campaign famous for keeping events buttoned-down and under control, last night had an awfully big detour from the script. (SOUNDBITE OF REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTION) (CHEERS, APPLAUSE) CLINT EASTWOOD: Save a little for Mitt. (LAUGHTER) LIASSON: It was Hollywood icon Clint Eastwood, the mystery guest chosen to surprise and delight the crowd; who ended up, instead, causing heartburn for the candidates and their wives. Eastwood delivered a weird, rambling, 15-minute monologue, where he turned to an empty chair and pretended to interview an invisible Barack Obama - including exchanges of implied vulgarity. EASTWOOD: And then, I- I - I just wondered, all these promises - and then I, I wondered about - you know, when the - what? What do you want me to tell Romney? I can't tell him to do that. He can't do that to himself. (LAUGHTER) EASTWOOD: You're crazy. You're absolutely crazy. (LAUGHTER, WHISTLES) EASTWOOD: You're getting as bad as Biden. (LAUGHTER) LIASSON: The cameras caught Mrs. Romney and Mrs. Ryan looking stricken, like the mother of the bride listening to a drunken wedding toast. It was a bizarre, comic detour from the main task of the evening: humanizing Mitt Romney. There were testimonials from people who had worked with Romney on the Olympics and at Bain Capital; and emotional tributes from members of Romney's Mormon congregation, describing how he had helped them in times of personal crisis. It was meant to counter the Obama campaign's caricature of Romney as an out-of-touch plutocrat. Florida Se. Marco Rubio introduced the nominee. SEN. MARCO RUBIO: Mitt Romney's success in business is well-known. But we've also learned that he's so much more than that. Mitt Romney's a devoted husband, a father, a grandfather, a generous member of his community and church, a role model for younger Americans like myself. Everywhere he's been, he's volunteered his time and talent to make things better for those around him. LIASSON: With every pitch for Romney, there was a poke at President Obama. RUBIO: Our problem with President Obama isn't that he's a bad person, OK? By all accounts he, too, is a good husband and a good father - and thanks to lots of practice, a good golfer. (LAUGHTER) RUBIO: Our problem is that he's a bad president. LIASSON: Then it was Romney's turn. MITT ROMNEY: Mr. Chairman and delegates, I accept your nomination for president of the United States. (CHEERS) LIASSON: Romney has been running for president for more than six years. But he still lacks a clear identity, for many voters. Last night's speech was his best chance to tell his own story. ROMNEY: Americans have a choice, a decision. To make that choice, you need to know more about me, and where I'd lead our country. LIASSON: In a recent CBS News poll, 41 percent of voters said Romney understands the problems of people like them. Fifty percent said he did not. Romney needs to correct that impression, and he needs to close the gender gap that Barack Obama has with women voters. So last night, he spoke about his wife's sacrifices at home, and his mother's Senate campaign; and his own efforts to help women. ROMNEY: As governor of Massachusetts, I chose a woman lieutenant governor, a woman chief of staff. Half of my Cabinet and senior officials were women. And in business, I mentored and supported great women leaders who went on to run great companies. LIASSON: Speaking more in sorrow than in anger, Romney told voters who had supported Barack Obama in 2008 that they had permission to make a change. He said four years ago he, too, had wanted the president to succeed. ROMNEY: Many of you felt that way, on Election Day four years ago. Hope and change had a powerful appeal. But tonight, I'd ask a simple question: If you felt that excitement when you voted for Barack Obama, shouldn't you feel that way now that he's President Obama? (APPLAUSE, WHISTLES) ROMNEY: You know there's something wrong with the kind of job he's done as president, when the best feeling you had was the day you voted for him. (LAUGHTER) LIASSON: Romney laid out a bill of particulars against Mr. Obama and his record. ROMNEY: In the richest country in the history of the world, this Obama economy has crushed the middle class. Family income has fallen by $4,000. But health insurance premiums are higher. Food prices are highe. Utility bills are higher. And gasoline prices? They've doubled. Today, more Americans wake up in poverty than ever before. LIASSON: Romney asked the challenger's classic question: Are you better off today than four years ago? ROMNEY: This president can ask us to be patient. This president can tell us it was someone else's fault. This president can tell us that the next four years, he'll get it right. But this president cannot tell us that you're better off today, than when he took office. (APPLAUSE) ROMNEY: America's been patient. Americans have supported this president, in good faith. But today, the time has come to turn the page. LIASSON: The Romney campaign's original premise was that voters were ready to fire the president, and Romney just needed to be an acceptable alternative. But when he picked Paul Ryan, he seemed to be signaling that his campaign had to be more than that; that it had to be about big ideas, and a vision for conservative reform. But last night, Romney played it safe, reiterating the broad goals of his five-point plan - the creation of 12 million jobs, more school choice, energy independence, and the repeal of Obamacare. ROMNEY: And let me make this very clear. Unlike President Obama, I will not raise taxes on the middle class of America. (CHEERS, APPLAUSE) ROMNEY: As president, I'll protect the sanctity of life. I'll honor the institution of marriage. (CHEERS, APPLAUSE) ROMNEY: And I will guarantee America's first liberty: the freedom of religion. (CHEERS, APPLAUSE) LIASSON: That was the only mention of social issues in the speech, and it was followed by a swipe at what Republicans consider to be President Obama's grandiosity. In contrast, Romney offered something much more down-to-earth. ROMNEY: President Obama promised to begin to slow the rise of the oceans ... (LAUGHTER) ROMNEY: ...and to heal the planet. (LAUGHTER) ROMNEY: My promise is to help you and your family. (CHEERS, APPLAUSE) LIASSON: Romney didn't talk about how he'd shrink the government or reform entitlements, the way Paul Ryan did on Wednesday. Instead, what he offered was himself; a man of family and faith but above all, a businessman with the skills to turn around the economy. ROMNEY: If I'm elected president of these United States, I will work with all my energy and soul, to restore that America; to lift our eyes to a better future. That future is our destiny. That future is out there. It is waiting for us. Our children deserve it. Our nation depends on it. The peace and freedom of the world require it and with your help, we will deliver it. Let us begin that future for America tonight! (CHEERS, APPLAUSE) LIASSON: The next few weeks will tell if Romney gets the typical post-convention bounce, and whether it will be fleeting or durable. But after the speech last night, delegates like Harold Coates, of Louisiana, were optimistic about Romney's chances in November. HAROLD COATES: I think it was just dynamic. I think it was really what we needed to hear. And we will see the action of it as well. He has - he has executive experience, both in the private and the public sector. I like that. So he knows how to deal from all angles, and make this country work. LIASSON: Now, Romney's fall campaign begins in earnest. Tomorrow, he's heading to the number one battle state for Republicans - Ohio. Mara Liasson, NPR News, Tampa. Copyright \u00a9 2012 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Mitt Romney has a tough to-do list. He has to walk an ideological tightrope. As he accepts the GOP presidential nomination tonight, Romney will try to fire up partisans in the convention hall and watching at home, without turning off moderates and independent voters. He also has to convey certain intangible qualities. The former Massachusetts governor will want to appear presidential while also attempting to lift his low \"likability\" ratings. All that, while perhaps also needing to bring fire to his normally reserved and controlled persona in order to follow other speeches that have roused the convention in Tampa, Fla. \u2014 most notably last night's address by his running mate, Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan. \"It seems like he's trying to ask one speech to do an awful lot,\" says David Yepsen, who directs a public policy institute at Southern Illinois University. President Obama will face similar paradoxical challenges next week at his convention, having to excite a Democratic base that appears more lukewarm than Republicans while also appealing to moderates, and having to ask for another term despite the still-sluggish economy. Romney, like Ryan, is \"going to emphasize the economy again and again and again,\" says Richard Finan, a former GOP president of the Ohio Senate. In addition to his yearlong critique of Obama on the economy and federal spending, Romney has signaled in recent weeks that he intends to broaden the attack to include issues such as welfare and Medicare. Parts of the Republican coalition have distrusted Romney because of his formerly more progressive positions on health care, gun control and gay rights. But he seems to have assuaged many doubters by adding a conservative like Ryan to the ticket, and he benefits from the strong desire among Republicans to turn Obama out from office. \"Now that he picked Paul Ryan and has the base of the party all excited, he has a little more room to aim a message at other voters that he needs,\" Yepsen says. Still, Finan and other observers expect Romney will continue to speak mainly to his party's core supporters, rather than attempting to pivot at this point more toward the political center. \"Romney's going to make a message and argument that makes Republican, right-of-center voters turn out,\" says David Carney, a GOP consultant based in New Hampshire. \"This is going to be a base election \u2014 there are so few undecided voters.\" There are other Republicans who believe Romney will need to appeal to the small number of swing voters in perhaps 10 key states who may ultimately determine the election. The electorate may be polarized, but neither candidate will win without picking up a few percent from voters in the middle. \"The base has to be confident he can win, and people on the edges have to be brought in to believe him,\" says David Woodard, a Republican consultant who teaches at Clemson University. Romney can't be all things to all people. He shouldn't signal a change in any position, says Gary Bauer, president of American Values and a prominent social conservative. But he still needs to demonstrate appeal to voters who are undecided and still may not know him well. \"The base is fired up,\" Bauer says. \"What his main goal ought to be is to help undecided voters imagine him, see him as president, as somebody that for four or eight years they would want to lead the country.\" That might be accomplished less with a litany of positions on issues, Bauer suggests, than \"the personal narrative and people seeing his heart and emotions.\" Romney also may speak more about his Mormon faith in this speech than he has through much of the campaign. Obama's polling lead has narrowed in recent days, as pollsters look less at registered voters and more at individuals they believe are in fact likely to turn out to vote. But the president's edge in terms of likability remains huge \u2014 54 percent for Obama versus 31 percent for Romney, according to a Gallup poll conducted last week. The likability gap was even wider in a recent NBC/Wall Street Journal poll. Several top Republicans have sought to dismiss the problem of Romney's unfavorability ratings this week, downplaying his need for a Sally Field moment that would make clear that people really like him. \"People don't care about liking who they elect,\" South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley told The New York Times on Tuesday. \"They care about electing someone who is going to work for them, that's going to fight for them, that's going to prove that they deserve to be there.\" The most important thing for Romney may be to establish his \"executive credentials\" and tout his own record of success in business, suggests Tom Ingram, a Republican consultant in Tennessee. Several of this week's GOP speakers, including Romney's wife, Ann, have emphasized that success in business is something to be celebrated rather than castigated. Romney will want to show that \"he's not only a fine businessman [but] a fine man,\" as Ryan said last night. It will be important for Romney to \"establish some connection\" with Americans who are struggling, Ingram says. \"He has to show some understanding of where the middle is, in terms of their frustrations and anger and expectations of government.\" Speaking to \"the middle,\" Ingram suggests, means speaking both to middle-class voters and to those in the middle of the ideological spectrum \u2014 independent voters and even moderate to conservative Democrats. \"We have both sides right now playing to their fringes, and that's not where the election's going to be won,\" Ingram says. \"The fringes are going to stay where they are.\"",

It's a big night for Ann Romney. She's addressing the Republican National Convention in Tampa at 10 p.m. Eastern, in a speech many pundits see as her big chance to combat her husband's \"likability gap\" and convince voters that Mitt the man is more than just a \"rich guy.\" So how does she handle the stress? Apparently, she bakes. On the flight down from Boston to Tampa today, the Republican presidential candidate's wife handed out Welsh cakes, made according to her grandmother's recipe, which she shared with us earlier this year. The small round cookies have a \"texture somewhere between shortbread and a scone,\" reports NPR White House Correspondent Ari Shapiro, who sampled the goods on the plane. \"Instead of working on my speech, which [senior campaign adviser] Stuart [Stevens] and I have now gotten down to a tweet,\" Romney joked with reporters, \"I decided I was so excited to be home that I just loved to do what I love to do, which is bake.\" Romney's comment, coming on the eve of her big moment in the campaign spotlight, stands in sharp contrast to how another then-potential first lady handled her growing public profile 20 years ago. In 1992, Hillary Clinton stepped into a political minefield when she famously quipped that she \"could have stayed home and baked cookies\" instead of pursuing a professional career. That old (and oversimplified) working-women v. stay-at-home mom campaign trail debate was reopened earlier this year, after a Democratic consultant tweeted that Ann Romney had \"never worked a day in her life.\" Ann Romney certainly has her work cut out for her now. As Chris Cillizza over at The Fix reports: \"New numbers from a Washington Post-ABC News poll paint Romney's challenge in stark terms. Six in ten registered voters said that Romney's policies in office would favor the wealthy while 30 percent said he would look more favorably on the middle class. (Six in ten voters said Obama's policies would favor the middle class.)\" And a poll out Tuesday from CBS News finds Romney also suffers from a \"empathy gap:\" \"Only 41 percent of Americans said Romney understands their needs and problems, compared to 54 percent who feel Mr. Obama understands their needs and problems.\" One can only assume Ann Romney hopes tonight's speech is as effective at winning people over as her Welsh cakes. As Ari Shapiro tells The Salt, they're delicious: \"I could definitely eat these every day for lunch.\"",

Romney says he wants to sharply cut income tax rates, but that those cuts would be revenue-neutral. Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney says he favors keeping all of the Bush-era tax cuts and then adding some more. To pay for these cuts, he would reduce or eliminate some of the tax deductions that many Americans have come to rely on. But his proposals are already facing a lot of resistance. Romney says he wants to sharply cut income tax rates, which would mean big tax cuts for higher-income people. But he says the cuts would be revenue-neutral. They would bring in the same amount of money to the Treasury because he would also get rid of some of the deductions that fill the tax code. \"I'm looking instead to lower tax rates and limit deductions and exemptions in such a way that we have enterprises, small businesses able to keep more of their capital and at the same time simplify the code,\" he said last week on Fox Business News. Tax Deductions Economists say simplifying the tax code is a good idea because it's filled with deductions that distort the economy. Because people can write off mortgage interest on their taxes, they're encouraged to buy more expensive houses than they otherwise might. \"What broadening the tax base does is get the tax code a little bit out of the business of picking, you know, which industries or sectors should get tax preferences, and more giving it back to individuals,\" says Glenn Hubbard, dean of the Columbia University Business School and a Romney adviser. Hubbard says he believes that simplifying the tax code and removing some of these distortions would be good for the economy in the long run. But doing so would be an enormous political challenge. For instance, the mortgage interest deduction has been used by some 75 million U.S. households. Getting rid of it would devastate an already-weak housing industry, says Lawrence Yun, chief economist at the National Association of Realtors. \"In every tax reform process, the mortgage interest deduction is discussed. However, at the end of the day, the elected official clearly recognizes that the mortgage interest deduction is very important for the economy, important for the middle class,\" he says. Likewise, there are big deductions for charitable contributions and health insurance premiums, and any politician who tries to do away with them is likely to do battle with angry taxpayers, not to mention lobbyists. Romney has so far avoided such a backlash by steadfastly refusing to say which deductions he wants to cut. Who's Affected? \"The underlying difficulty in analyzing all of this is he has not actually said how he would pay for all of these cuts,\" says William Gale of the Tax Policy Center, who co-authored a paper on Romney's tax plan. Gale says you can't pay for Romney's tax cuts for high earners just by eliminating deductions \u2014 unless you also raise taxes on the middle class. \"When you actually look at the available tax expenditures that can be reduced, there aren't enough of them in the upper-income class categories to pay for the various tax cuts that high-income households get,\" he said. The Romney campaign has criticized that report, saying it made some wrong assumptions about which deductions Romney was willing to eliminate. In reality, says Hubbard, everything is on the table. \"What he's committed to do is working with the Congress to making sure that the tax plan is both revenue-neutral and fair, that is, distributionally-neutral, and there's enough tax expenditures to do that,\" he says. \"How you do that is something that both he and the Congress would have to decide.\" Hubbard also says the Tax Policy Center report underestimates the powerful impact that broadening the tax base would have on growth. That would mean more long-term revenue for the government. It's a variation on an argument that Republicans have long made about tax cuts, and it's much in dispute among economists. Still, there is widespread agreement that eliminating deductions would be a good idea, that it would at the very least make the tax code fairer and less confusing. The challenge lies in winning over the many millions of Americans who now benefit from the deductions and won't look kindly on efforts to change them.",

            "article_content": "In late August of 2008, just as delegates were coming together for their political-party conventions, the U.S. economy was falling apart. Home sales were shutting down, employers were slashing payrolls, and financial institutions were lurching toward chaos. Subsequent weeks saw political leaders and regulators fighting through one gut-wrenching day after another, trying to avert a complete collapse of global markets. On Sept. 24, Republican presidential candidate John McCain temporarily suspended his campaign to help Congress develop financial bailout plans. Today, as the GOP convention gets (briefly) under way, the nation's economic condition is far more stable. The coming political fights over economic issues are likely to be bare-knuckled, but probably not white-knuckled. Although the sense of panic has passed, times are not good for many. Yes, stock prices are up and financial institutions are on firmer footing, but millions of Americans are slipping further from their middle-class moorings. Some 12.8 million people are looking for jobs, and data show middle-class income and wealth are both down from a decade ago. The mixed state of the 2012 economy will provide Republicans and Democrats with much to debate. The spin is best left to political candidates, but the data can tell an objective story about the state of the economy as the conventions begin. The Republicans are meeting this week in Tampa, Fla., and Democrats will meet the following week in Charlotte, N.C. As they gather, this is what we know: JOBS The national unemployment rate has been hovering in a narrow range throughout 2012 \u2014 between 8.1 and 8.3 percent. The rate shifts only a bit each month as economists round and revise the statistics on payrolls and job seekers. Most economists expect the jobless rate to stay in this tight range for the remainder of the year. Young job-seekers look over a list of 85 business participating in a job fair last week in Washington, D.C.\n                \n                    \n                    Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Young job-seekers look over a list of 85 business participating in a job fair last week in Washington, D.C. The historical record suggests such a high rate of unemployment dooms an incumbent president. One new study concludes that President Obama's candidacy will fail because no incumbent in recent decades has been re-elected with the jobless rate so high for so long. \"The incumbency advantage enjoyed by President Obama, though statistically significant, is not great enough to offset high rates of unemployment currently experienced in many of the states,\" Kenneth Bickers, a political science professor at the University of Colorado, Boulder, said in his study of election outcomes. Then again, the employment picture is brighter than four years ago, when the economy was plunging into the worst recession since the Great Depression. When Obama took office in January 2009, the U.S. economy was losing more than 800,000 jobs a month and the unemployment rate was heading to 10 percent later that year. In 2012, employers have been adding an average of 151,000 jobs each month, about the same pace as in 2011, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. So while the job market could be described as significantly underperforming, it also could be seen as doing much better than it was four years ago, giving candidates and voters much to argue over. HOUSING The housing market has been in horrible condition since 2007. During the past five years, prices for existing homes have plunged by roughly a third and builders in many markets have virtually stopped putting up houses. Foreclosures and short sales remain common. Sales of new homes, like this one in Palo Alto, Calif., rose 3.6 percent in July.\n                \n                    \n                    Paul Sakuma/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Sales of new homes, like this one in Palo Alto, Calif., rose 3.6 percent in July. Still, many economists see signs of improving conditions, and even strength in specific markets, such as Washington, D.C., and Bismarck, N.D. Mortgage rates have been at record lows this summer, making buying very affordable by historic standards. The latest data from the National Association of Realtors show that the average sale price for an existing home is up about 7 percent this year, compared with last year. While the housing sector may be moving up, the hole remains very deep. \"We are expecting this market to improve over the second half of this year, but not by much,\" Patrick Newport, an economist with IHS Global Insight, wrote in an analysis of housing data. STOCK MARKET The days just after the political parties held their conventions in 2008 were among the most frightening ever experienced by investors alive today. On just one day \u2014 Sept. 29, 2008 \u2014 the Dow Jones industrial average plunged 7 percent, wiping out $1.2 trillion. Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange.

The Dow Jones industrial average is nearly back to where it was before the recession hit in 2007. In the past year, the stock market has been doing well. The Dow has shot up to around 13,160, up from about 10,400 last October. This summer saw a major rally. That push helped the closely followed stock market barometer to get back up to nearly where it was in 2007, before the recession began. But trading volume remains extremely light, suggesting that many investors remain wary. In fact, some market analysts predict that a big drop could be coming this September because of bad news coming from the European Union and China. Many also say the coming \"fiscal cliff,\" a cluster of major tax and spending changes coming at the end of the year, could frighten away investors who fear a new recession. So while stocks have generally been a positive indicator this year, huge risks may be looming on the horizon.",

If you want to understand how the White House race will play out in North Carolina as we enter the convention phase, talking to Carter Wrenn, a Republican, and Gary Pearce, a Democrat, is a good start. The two veteran political strategists have, over decades, been involved in many a Tar Heel campaign. Long-time North Carolina Republican political strategist Carter Wrenn senses President Obama may have the momentum in the Tar Heel state.\n                \n                    \n                    Frank James/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Long-time North Carolina Republican political strategist Carter Wrenn senses President Obama may have the momentum in the Tar Heel state. One of Wrenn's best known clients was Jesse Helms, the late North Carolina senator renowned for both his surliness and race baiting. Pearce was a long-time strategist for one of North Carolina's most popular governors, Jim Hunt. Wrenn and Pearce jointly write a consistently entertaining state politics blog, Talking About Politics. The men first met in 1984 during debate negotiations for the Helms-Hunt Senate race. Pearce's candidate lost. During a recent visit to North Carolina, the host of this year's Democratic National Convention, It's All Politics spoke with them to get their takes on how the race between President Obama and Mitt Romney is shaping up in the state. North Carolina is a state both presidential campaigns badly want to win. On balance, the state is probably more critical to Romney's White House hopes than Obama's. The president has a path to the required 270 electoral votes without North Carolina. Romney? Not so much. At his office in Raleigh, the state capital, Wrenn said his sense is that Obama now has an edge in a state that has gone red in presidential elections since 1976, with just one exception: Obama won the state four years ago by a mere 14,000 votes. But since then, Republicans have reasserted themselves, taking over the statehouse in 2010. Meanwhile, Democratic Gov. Bev Perdue, who rode the same Democratic surge as Obama into office, became so unpopular, she eschewed running for re-election. Because of the Legislature shift and its conservative tendencies, some analysts view the state as more likely a Romney state than a toss-up. But it's far from certain Romney will win it. Wrenn said: \"My friends can't imagine Obama beating Romney in North Carolina. And that's basically true in the Republican Party right now. [Republicans] had a huge win in 2010. And Obama's been unpopular [in the state] for most of his presidency. \"So in that world that I move in all I hear is 'Obama can't win.' But when I move into the world of polling and experience, maybe, I say 'This is overconfidence. This is getting carried away. When you look at the polling data, it all says 'close election.' And when I look at the two campaigns, Romney's and Obama's, my experience says that Obama has got a little more momentum and that he's sort of found his groove. You know, campaigns search a long time to find their groove. I think Obama's found his, and I think Romney is still searching for it.\" \"Obama's found what his campaign's about. It's the middle-class issue really. You get right down to the guts of his message and it's that 'I'm going to fight for the middle class and Romney's representing the wealthy. ' \" Even in a state like North Carolina, which is as politically polarized as any \u2014 maybe more so \u2014 Wrenn said, that's a message that speaks to many voters, including independents. It could likely help Obama shift into his column the small number of North Carolina voters who are still persuadable. Wrenn said to think like a pollster about the race in North Carolina. Democrats are 42 percent of the state's registered voters, Republicans 33 percent and independents 25 percent. Of course, Obama won't get that full 42 percent of the electorate that are Democrats, Wrenn said. Instead, based on the latest polling he has seen, he gives Obama about 36 percent and Romney 6 percent of voters in that category. That 6 percent represents mostly older, rural white men, formerly Jessecrats (think Helms) of the \"It will be a cold day in hell before I vote for Obama\" variety. Mortality has caught up with those old Jessecrats as has demographic shifts in the state's population as transplants, including retirees and young professionals, move in from other states and the Hispanic population grows. Of the 33 percent of the state's voters who are Republicans, Romney has nearly all of them, about 30 percent of the electorate, while Obama gets the remaining 3 percent. That leaves independents. Give Romney 12 percent of the electorate to Obama's 8 percent of the electorate that fits into that category. That leaves 5 percent of the electorate up for grabs, voters who are both independent and undecided. It might be a little more, however, since some independents now leaning toward Obama or Romney could still be persuaded to switch. Wrenn says Romney has had an advantage with these North Carolina independents; they had a low opinion of Obama's job performance. But the president's middle class, Medicare and abortion messages are aimed squarely at these independents and he's making some headway with them, from what Wrenn can tell, because these voters mostly agree with the president on those issues. Pointing to the column for independent voters on his sheet of paper, Wrenn says: \"What the vice presidential [Paul] Ryan thing does is it's going to create a much better debate in the presidential campaign, but it's going to be a hard debate for Romney to win with those voters. So I think that can help Obama. All these margins are so narrow, that if he gains 10 percent with independents, that's the game.\" Pearce, the Democrat, is upbeat about the position Democrats find themselves in. \"It's great to be a battleground state because for so many years we didn't particularly count. And it's great for Democrats. It's obviously a tough state for Obama to win. But he can win. And in my view he wins just by forcing Romney to fight here. He's fighting in Romney's end of the field. \"If Obama wins North Carolina, there's no way he doesn't get re-elected. And conversely, if Romney doesn't win North Carolina, there's no way he can get to the White House.\" As is true elsewhere, in North Carolina it's been a challenge for Obama to recapture the lightning in a bottle of his historic 2008 candidacy. But don't mistake that for a lack of urgency or energy, says Pearce. \"It's obviously a different atmosphere. Obama was new, the election was a referendum on Bush in many ways and [Sen. John] McCain was a pretty weak candidate. The dynamic is very different. \"So there may not be the idealism and enthusiasm that there was four years ago but I think on the Democratic side, there's damn sure a desire to re-elect Obama and a real resistance to Romney and Republicans and what everybody sees as a hard right turn by the Republicans. That's all energizing by itself. It's a different energy. It's a different source. But energy is energy and it's there.\" Pearce also has seen no evidence that the Obama campaign has lost any of its 2008 mastery of the ground game \u2014 identifying unregistered voters and getting them on the rolls and to the polls. Far from it. \"I was never a big ground game person. I was a message medium person. But the Obama people have proven that ground game can work. And they have invested one hell of a lot of money in it. They've got a lot of people working. Lot of young people. \"There's still a big pool of African-American voters. There's increasing numbers of Hispanic voters. And, by definition, there's a whole new crop of college students across the state. So I don't underestimate the hidden power of their ability to reshape the electorate. That's how they won four years ago; they turned out thousands of new voters. And I wouldn't underestimate his ability to do it again.\" Pearce observes that Obama has offices in rural towns across the state, in places like tiny Louisburg, population 3,382 in 2011. Nearly 40 percent of the population is African-American. Their rate of voter registrations traditionally lagged behind their white neighbors. Thus, Obama has, relatively speaking, more voters he can tap than does Romney. \"That's the thing. He can do something Romney can't. There's a deep well of voters out there for Obama.\"",

Romney said he has \"nothing hidden\" in his taxes. With running mate Paul Ryan's tax returns released on a Friday night \u2014 a good week and a half ahead of the Republican convention \u2014 the presidential campaign can finally move off the subject of tax returns. Or so Mitt Romney can hope. In reality, the numbers in the Wisconsin congressman's filings provide new data points, for those inclined to see things this way, about how far Romney's financial situation is from that of ordinary voters. Depends On The Income Compared to the median American family, Ryan is wealthy, with a total income of $215,000 in 2010 and $323,000 last year. Compared to Romney, though, he is poor. Despite this, Ryan's effective federal tax rates exceed the 13.9 percent Romney paid in 2010, and the 15.4 percent Romney estimates he will pay in 2011 when his return is finalized. Romney has tried to explain that his rate is a result of his income deriving from investments rather than wages. But to the extent that it illustrates how skewed the tax code has become in favor of \"unearned\" income versus \"earned\" income, the explanation may play right into the hands of President Obama and Democrats, who have been arguing that the wealthiest should have to pay more. Of all the candidates, Vice President Joe Biden has the least complicated finances \u2014 no outside book income, no capital gains, no dividends.\n                \n                    \n                    Jay LaPrete/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Of all the candidates, Vice President Joe Biden has the least complicated finances \u2014 no outside book income, no capital gains, no dividends. Two years of tax returns are now available for inspection for both GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney and running mate Paul Ryan (Romney's 2011 return is still preliminary), as well as a full 12 years for both President Obama and Vice President Joe Biden. Among the contrasts that become apparent: -- S.V. Date A major \u2014 although, perhaps not widely understood \u2014 result of the 2003 tax cuts was to lower the maximum tax rate on capital gains and qualified dividends to 15 percent. This category makes up the lion's share of income for the richest Americans. And because that category is already exempt from Social Security and Medicare taxes, middle-class Americans who make their livings from a job with a paycheck typically pay a higher percentage in federal taxes than those who live on investment income. Social Security and Medicare taxes total about 15 percent, and that's before any federal income tax is added. About half of the Ryan family income in the years he released came from his congressional salary, which was subject to those payroll taxes. The rest came from various investments and, in 2011, a trust benefiting his wife, Janna Ryan, upon the death of her mother. Ryan, in fact, filed an amended return this May, amid vetting by the Romney campaign as they mulled the choice of a running mate. The stated reason for the new filing: to include income from the trust that was \"inadvertently omitted on the originally filed return.\" The 'Right Number'? The details of Ryan's taxes, though, seemed less significant than the fact of their release, which let the Obama campaign steer the topic of the day back toward one that has hounded Romney since his Republican rivals hammered on it back in January. During a South Carolina debate back then, Romney was asked if he would release his returns, and he answered, \"Maybe,\" to a chorus of boos. He was reminded then, as the Obama people remind him now, that it was his own father, George Romney, who set the standard for presidential candidates releasing tax returns in the interests of full disclosure. Two weeks after the South Carolina event, at a Florida debate, Romney answered the tax-return question: \"I agree with my dad on a lot of things, but we also disagree. ... And going out with 12 years of returns is not something I'm going to do. I'm putting out two years, which is more than anyone else on this stage,\" he said. \"I think it'll satisfy the interests of the American people to see that I pay my taxes, where I give my charitable contributions to, and I think that's the right number.\" Those two years, though, are less than the three years Romney said he would release in 1994, as he was running against Democratic Sen. Ted Kennedy. \"It's time the biggest-taxing senator in Washington shows the people of Massachusetts how much he pays in taxes,\" Romney said, according to an April 14, 1994, account in The Boston Globe. In that race, Kennedy did not release his tax returns, and neither did Romney. Obama Tries To Make A Deal Four years ago, tax returns did become an issue in the Democratic presidential primary. In March, Obama released seven years of returns, 2000 through 2006. Then-Sen. Hillary Clinton released her returns some weeks later, and called on Obama to release his 2007 return, which he then did just two hours before a key debate in Philadelphia. Obama's eventual Republican opponent in 2008, John McCain, only released two years of returns. But Obama did not make a big issue of it then. (McCain, when vetting potential running mates, received 23 years worth of returns from Romney.) Obama is clearly making an issue of it now. On Friday, his campaign promised not to bug Romney about it any further if he released three more years worth (Romney was not interested). And on Saturday, the Obama camp emailed its supporters inviting them to sign a letter insisting that Romney release more returns. In the intervening years since 2008, Obama and Vice President Joe Biden have released four more years of returns, meaning that anyone with an Internet connection can now peruse their income tax returns from a full 12 years. That's the same number that George Romney released in 1968. S.V. D\u00e1te is the congressional editor on NPR's Washington Desk.",

But the give-and-take keeps Romney on the defensive, and promises to keep the issue of Romney's taxes going for weeks to come. In case you missed it, Obama campaign manager Jim Messina wrote an open letter to Matt Rhoades, his counterpart with the Romney campaign. An excerpt: \"Governor Romney apparently fears that the more he offers, the more our campaign will demand that he provide. So I am prepared to provide assurances on just that point: if the Governor will release five years of returns, I commit in turn that we will not criticize him for not releasing more \u2014 neither in ads nor in other public communications or commentary for the rest of the campaign. \"This request for the release of five years, covering the complete returns for 2007-2012, is surely not unreasonable. Other Presidential candidates have released more, including the Governor's father who provided 12 years of returns.\" Rhoades essentially responded with \"drop dead,\" although he used a few more words: \"It is clear that President Obama wants nothing more than to talk about Governor Romney's tax returns instead of the issues that matter to voters, like putting Americans back to work, fixing the economy and reining in spending. \"If Governor Romney's tax returns are the core message of your campaign, there will be ample time for President Obama to discuss them over the next 81 days. \"In the meantime, Governor Romney will continue to lay out his plans for a stronger middle class, to save Medicare, to put work back into welfare, and help the 23 million Americans struggling to find work in the Obama economy. \"See you in Denver.\" Denver, of course, is the site of the first presidential debate on Oct. 3. Both campaigns will likely find many supporters for their positions. Recent polls suggest voters are split on the tax return issue. For instance, Gallup had a July poll indicating that 54 percent of those surveyed wanted Romney to release more tax returns; but 37 percent said he shouldn't. Among Republicans, that figure was 65 percent. A Quinnipiac University/New York Times/CBS News poll conducted in August of voters in Wisconsin, Colorado and Virginia showed similar results. For Romney, the offer from Messina doesn't really change the dynamics. He has adamantly refused to release any more tax returns beyond the 2010 return he has already made public, and the 2011 return he has pledged to release. Releasing more taxes now would just make it appear that he was caving in to pressure from Obama.",

            "article_content": "One of the candidates is House Speaker John Boehner's close friend and golfing buddy. The other is an ally of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. Both have their roots in rural Iowa, have long served together in the U.S. House, and are pretty darn well-liked by their constituents. But Iowa, the focus of the political world this week, lost a House seat in congressional redistricting that came after the 2010 census. That has put nine-term Republican Tom Latham, 64, (Boehner's confidante) and eight-term Democrat Leonard Boswell, 78, (Pelosi's loyalist) on a collision course in Iowa's newly configured 3rd Congressional District. It's one of only two districts in the nation where incumbents will be facing off in the fall election; the other is in Ohio. The closely watched match in the slightly Republican-leaning district has drawn the attention, and big money, of the national political action committees, most notably Republican Karl Rove's Crossroads GPS. Big guns Boehner and Pelosi have raised money for their candidates, though Latham's friendship with the speaker has proven much more lucrative in the fundraising realm. (And Republicans took delight that a Pelosi fundraiser for Boswell earlier this year was held across the Nebraska state line in Omaha.) The Machine Shed Restaurant in suburban Des Moines, Iowa, in the state's newly configured 3rd Congressional District.\n                \n                    \n                    Liz Halloran/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption The Machine Shed Restaurant in suburban Des Moines, Iowa, in the state's newly configured 3rd Congressional District. The congressmen's records, outside of their broad agreement on issues related to agriculture (although Boswell recently has been hitting Latham on the failure of the Boehner-led House to approve drought relief), provide a clear contrast for voters in the new district. The territory includes Polk County, home to Des Moines, a few fast-growing suburban counties, and a dozen other largely rural, lightly populated and conservative counties in the state's southwest corner. Just four of the district's 16 counties voted for Barack Obama in 2008; but one of them was vote-rich Polk, where he drubbed Republican Sen. John McCain by more than 30,000 votes \u2014 a margin that far exceeded the total vote in all but two of the other new 3rd District counties. But that won't happen this time, says David Wasserman, House editor of the Cook Political Report, a nonpartisan publication that analyzes political races. Boswell's fate largely hinges on how well he and, more importantly, Obama run in Polk County come November. Boswell insists, however, that his farm roots will serve him well outside the metro area, and in rural areas that he represented before the last redistricting. \"Obama very narrowly won this area last time,\" Wasserman says, adding that right now Republican Mitt Romney may have an edge in the district. \"There's no reason to believe that Boswell is going to run much differently from Obama, but he probably has to outperform Obama by a few points in the southern tier of the district.\" Wasserman says Latham will likely do better than Romney in Dallas County outside Des Moines, and in Pottawattamie County, which includes Council Bluffs. \"Overall, I think the results of this congressional race ought to track pretty closely with the presidential race,\" he says. Latham, in a recent interview before hosting a senior citizens round table at the Machine Shed Restaurant in suburban Des Moines, characterized the matchup as one that will give district voters \"the clearest choice race you could possibly have.\" The two congressmen have been on opposite sides of a slew of recent issues, from the Wall Street bailout and the stimulus, to the health care overhaul legislation and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Boswell supported them all; Latham opposed them all. Boswell angered some Democrats recently when he joined House Republicans in show votes to extend Bush tax cuts, and to hold Attorney General Eric Holder in criminal contempt over the release of documents in a drug-and-gun-sale operation. \"It's a high-profile race, and it's going to be a contest,\" Boswell said recently at a fundraiser in suburban Des Moines. \"I don't care if they've got $5 million or $20 million.\" Latham certainly doesn't have $20 million, but he has an enormous money advantage going into the fall race. He's been able to stockpile money over the past several election cycles, Wasserman says, while Boswell has had to spend on tough races. Romney's choice of Rep. Paul Ryan as his running mate, however, has given Boswell some fodder in recent days. He has used as a fundraising pitch Latham's support of Ryan's controversial budget plan that would remake Medicare, rewrite the tax code in a way that analyses show would shift the burden to middle- and lower-class earners, and dramatically cut government aid and services in other areas. Latham this week has characterized Ryan as a Midwestern truth-teller who will not be a drag on GOP congressional candidates, despite Democrats' immediate efforts to use the new vice presidential pick's budget positions to hammer Republicans in House races across the county. The Money The most recent campaign finance reports filed by the candidates show that through June 30, Latham's 2011-2012 campaign had $2.14 million on hand; Boswell's had $472,249. An analysis by OpenSecrets.org shows that Latham's top contributors are tobacco giant Altria Group and Berkshire Hathaway, and that he has received more than $252,000 from leadership political action committees \u2014 including $10,000 from Boehner's Freedom Project. Three percent of his campaign money has come from small donors. Boswell's top contributors, according to OpenSecrets, are Knapp Properties of Des Moines and Pelosi's leadership PAC, PAC to the Future, which has given him $10,000. He has received $97,000 from leadership PACs. Eight percent of his money has come from small donors. The Numbers Reapportionment may have squeezed Latham out of his district, but Boswell lost his old 3rd District's Democratic majority. When he was re-elected in 2010, Democrats had a more than 20,000 advantage in registered voters. In the new district, registered Republicans outnumber Democrats by about 15,000. The Narrative Boswell's stock phrase is that he's running against a big-money \"team\": Latham, Boehner and Rove. His campaign has also attempted to \"Romney-ize\" Latham, by emphasizing his wealth, while stressing Boswell's humble farm roots, his military career and a locally famous incident last year when he fought off an armed home intruder. \"I want to focus on the economy, and focus on the future,\" Boswell says. Latham says the election will be a \"referendum on spending.\" \"The debt and deficits are very worrisome for Iowans,\" he said. \"We need to cut spending, and take the uncertainty out of the economy.\" About his wealth, from a family seed business, Latham said: \"My parents had very little and worked very hard. I make no apologies for working very hard. The class warfare stuff doesn't work around here.\" The Outlook The Cook Political Report rates the race as a tossup, a reflection of the new district. Cook's \"Partisan Voting Index,\" which rates the political proclivities of House districts, has Iowa's new 3rd District voters as historically favoring Republicans in presidential elections by one point more than the national average. The Rothenberg Political Report, another race forecasting shop, has rated the race as a tossup/tilt Republican. The results out of the 3rd District are unlikely to affect the balance of power of the House \u2014 Democrats need a net gain of 25 seats for a majority. But Democrats are predicting that if Boswell goes down, the younger Latham could control the seat for the coming decade. \"This is the most important election Leonard Boswell has ever had,\" said Ed Skinner, an Altoona lawyer who hosted the recent fundraiser for the candidate. \"If we lose, we'll have 10 years of Tom Latham.\" Says Latham: \"We're not letting up a second.\"",

Paul Ryan, R-Wis., speaks Saturday in Norfolk, Va., after being named Mitt Romney's vice presidential running mate. One thing Republican Mitt Romney's choice of Rep. Paul Ryan as his running mate will certainly do is elevate issues like Medicare and Medicaid to the top of the election agenda. As the nation gets closer to Election Day, Ryan's addition to the GOP ticket will present the public with a dramatic choice about the role the government should play in health care. One thing the Wisconsin congressman never does is apologize for thinking big. \"We also think we have a moral obligation to try and fix this country's big problems before they get out of our control,\" Ryan said in February on ABC's This Week. Ryan is referring, among other things, to the budget plan he wrote and helped muscle through the House \u2014 twice. His plan would cut taxes, create private accounts for Social Security and, perhaps most notably, make major changes to the Medicare and Medicaid health programs. The Medicare changes in particular are dramatic. Starting a decade from now, seniors would get a set amount of money rather than automatic coverage. They could use that to choose from a range of health plans. \"Doing it this way harnesses the power of choice and competition,\" Ryan said at a news conference last December. \"Our goal here is to have the senior citizen, the beneficiary, be the nucleus of this program.\" The amount of money the senior gets, however, wouldn't necessarily go up as fast as medical costs. Ryan and those who support his idea say that choice and competition would maintain the benefits. Others, including President Obama, aren't so sure. \"It says instead of guaranteed health care, you will get a voucher,\" Obama said in a speech last spring in which he blasted Ryan's budget plan. \"If that voucher isn't worth enough to buy the insurance that's available in the open marketplace, well tough luck, you're on your own.\" On Medicaid, Ryan's proposal would give states far more flexibility to decide how and who to cover, but also less money to do it with. In an appearance on PBS Newshour, Ryan said that what they're trying to do is couple Medicaid reforms with reforms in other programs such as food stamps, housing assistance, education and job training. \"We are trying to couple these things by sending them back to the states in block grants so the states can combine these dollars and reform the tattered social safety net,\" he said. Analysts, however, say the cuts would be so large \u2014 about a one-third reduction over 10 years \u2014 states would have no choice other than to cut benefits or drop people from the rolls. Obama has said that this could put some elderly and poor people at risk. At least one thing that's clear about Ryan's vision for health care compared to Obama's is that they're different. No one will mistake one for the other, says Aaron Carroll, a pediatrician and professor at the Indiana University School of Medicine who blogs on health economics. He says this campaign should give voters a clear choice. \"I think what Ryan puts forward is a vision of much less government involvement in things like Medicare and Medicaid, especially from the federal level,\" Carroll says. What's less clear, however, Carroll says, is whether the nation really is ready to have what Ryan likes to refer to as an \"adult conversation\" about how to control entitlement spending. \"We probably can, but not in politics,\" he says. \"Because in politics, of course, people want to win, and you win by scaring people into thinking [about] what the other side will do.\" In 2010, Republicans tried to scare seniors about Obama's health law and Medicare. This time around, it will be the Democrats who will try to turn the tables.",

Paul Ryan, R-Wis., looks on during a campaign rally in Manassas, Va., after being named Mitt Romney's running mate Saturday. Who Is He? The young chairman of the House Budget Committee came to national prominence as architect of a Republican budget plan after the GOP took the House in the 2010 midterm elections. Ryan's plan would slash government spending, simplify tax laws while cutting taxes on the wealthy, and fundamentally change entitlement programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. The seven-term congressman representing southeastern Wisconsin's1st Congressional District has been a member of Congress since age 28. Age: 42, born in Janesville, Wis. Experience: House member since 1999 and Budget Committee chairman since 2011. Also serves on tax-writing Ways and Means Committee. Before entering Congress, worked on the 1996 vice presidential campaign of Jack Kemp, for Sen. Sam Brownback of Kansas and for Sen. Robert Kasten of Wisconsin. Legislative Highlights: Ryan's budget plans have passed the GOP-controlled House but not the Democratic-controlled Senate. Supported President Obama's auto bailout, which is often derided by Mitt Romney. He turned down an offer to become President George W. Bush's budget director during Bush's second term. How He Helps Romney: Ryan delights cultural and fiscal conservatives (The Wall Street Journal, Weekly Standard and National Review all had urged the pick in recent days). He instantly helps to energize the party's base: Former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum, who attracted conservatives in the GOP primary, lauded the choice of a \" full-spectrum conservative\" who is \"solidly pro-life, pro-family.\" He could help Romney in the battleground state of Wisconsin and perhaps elsewhere in the Midwest. What Democrats Are Saying: The choice only magnifies Obama's claims that Romney's policies would help the rich at the expense of middle-class Americans. In a statement, the Obama campaign said Romney's choice of \"the architect of the radical Republican House budget\" gives him a running mate \"who shares his commitment to the flawed theory that new budget-busting tax cuts for the wealthy, while placing greater burdens on the middle class and seniors, will somehow deliver a stronger economy.\" Family/Personal: Maintains a home in Janesville, Wis., with wife, Janna, and three young children: daughter, Liza, and sons Charlie and Sam. The fifth-generation Wisconsin native has personal assets somewhere between $927,100 and $3.2 million, according to financial disclosure forms, as reported by Politico. Religion: Catholic Education: Bachelor's degrees in economics and political science from Miami University in Ohio.

The official word, which began leaking overnight, came early this morning from the Romney campaign via a smartphone app and a news release. It's something of a surprise. While Ryan was on all the lists when it came time to speculate about Romney's likely choice, the conventional wisdom had been that it was more likely to be someone such as Ohio Sen. Rob Portman or Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. Ryan comes from a competitive state with just 10 Electoral College votes. Ohio's 18 and Florida's 29 are much more valuable prizes. But Ryan is a favorite of conservatives across the nation for his tough talk about tax cuts, spending cuts and fiscal discipline. The two are set to formally accept their party's nominations at the Republican National Convention later this month in Tampa. We've been following the news about the choice of Ryan, the 42-year-old chairman of the House Budget Committee who is nationally known for his championing of tax and spending cuts. Be sure to hit your \"refresh\" button to get our latest updates. Update at 9:50 a.m. ET. Now, \"A Different Conversation\": With the choice of Ryan, NPR's Don Gonyea says, the Republican ticket can now \"start a different conversation and a conversation about what they plan on doing.\" Update at 9:46 a.m. ET. And In Conclusion, Ryan Pledges To \"Get This Done!\": As he wrapped up his remarks, Ryan said he is thrilled to be part of the ticket and promised that a Romney/Ryan administration would \"unite America and get this done!\" Update at 9:45 a.m. ET. Reapplying The Founding Principles: Ryan gets more strong approval when he says: \"We won't duck the tough issues, we will lead. ... We won't blame others, we will take responsibility. ... And we won't replace our founding principles, we will reapply them.\" Update at 9:43 a.m. ET. Strong Cheers: Some of the biggest cheers so far for Ryan come when he says \"our rights come from nature and God, not from government.\" Update at 9:38 a.m. ET. This Isn't \"The New Normal\": Ryan says that under President Obama, the \"new normal\" for many Americans has become \"diminished dreams, lowered expectations, uncertain futures.\" That shouldn't be, he says. Update at 9:36 a.m. ET. \"Debt, Doubt And Despair\": The Obama administration, Ryan says, has compiled a \"record of failure.\" \"We find ourselves in a nation facing debt, doubt and despair,\" he tells the crowd. Update at 9:35 a.m. ET. \"To Save The American Dream\": \"It is our duty to save the American dream for our children and their's,\" says Romney. Update at 9:33 a.m. ET. Ryan Says He's \"Committed In Heart And Mind?\" \"I am committed in heart and mind\" to putting his experience to work in a Romney administration, Ryan says. Update at 9:30 a.m. ET. Romney's Recovery: Saying that every once in a while he makes a mistake (as in, referring to Ryan as \"the next president of the United States\"), Romney just came back to the microphone to say he didn't make a mistake in choosing Ryan. Update at 9:28 a.m. ET. Romney Calls Ryan \"The Next President Of The United States\": In the excitement of introducing his running mate, Romney just said \"join me, in welcoming the next president of the United States, Paul Ryan.\" Update at 9:27 a.m. ET. Obama Campaign Reaction: As Romney continues his remarks, Obama campaign manager Jim Messina has sent reporters a statement that says, in part, that Romney has chosen \"a leader of the House Republicans who shares his commitment to the flawed theory that new budget-busting tax cuts for the wealthy, while placing greater burdens on the middle class and seniors, will somehow deliver a stronger economy.\" Update at 9:25 a.m. ET. Romney Promises \"Positive\" Ideas: He and Ryan, Romney says, will offer a \"positive governing agenda.\" Update at 9:23 a.m. ET. Ryan Is In Politics For Right Reasons, Romney Says: Ryan isn't in politicos \"to advance his personal ambition,\" Romney says, \"but to advance the ideals of freedom and justice.\" Update at 9:21 a.m. ET. Romney Gets Right To The News: \"It's an honor to announce my running mate and the next vice president of the United States, Paul Ryan!\" Romney just announced. Update at 9:20 a.m. ET. Romney Arrives: Romney just popped out of a door aboard the USS Wisconsin, jogged down to the dock, and is at the microphone. He's getting a loud welcome. Update at 9:10 a.m. ET. Candidates To Be On Stage Shortly: Both of the candidates' spouses are now on stage in Norfolk and Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell is at the microphone. So it looks like Romney and Ryan will be appearing shortly. Update at 9:05 a.m. ET. First Rule Of VP Picks Is \"Do No Harm\": On NPR's broadcast, correspondent Don Gonyea just said that the first rule when selecting a running mate is \"do no harm.\" It remains to be seen, of course, whether Romney has succeeded with his choice of Ryan. Update at 8:57 a.m. ET. Live Streaming: We'll be updating with highlights from the candidates' first joint appearance. Of course, it's also going to be broadcast on the cable news networks and will be streamed online by various outlets, including C-SPAN. You can listen live on many NPR stations, and on NPR.org. Update at 8:52 a.m. ET. From The Right Side Of The Blogosphere, Talk Of Credentials And Charm; Sighs Of Relief: Ed Morrissey, prominent conservative blogger at HotAir.com, writes that \"Ryan has solid policy credentials, but also has enough media presence and charm to make people listen. Team Obama will hang Ryan's budget on Romney, but they were going to do that anyway. Why not have the man himself as the VP to explain it?\" Another leading conservative blogger, Erick Erickson of RedState.com, says \"the sighs you hear are Republicans sighing some relief. Finally, the Romney campaign has a spokesman who can do what Mitt Romney has never been capable of doing \u2014 defend success and articulate a message of why we must reform our nation's budget and support free markets.\" Update at 8:50 a.m. ET. Choice Made On Aug. 1, CNN Reports: A \"senior Romney adviser\" has told CNN that Romney decided Ryan would be his running mate on Aug. 1. Update at 8:42 a.m. ET. \"Controversial\" Architect Of Budget Plan: The Associated Press calls Ryan \"the architect of a conservative and intensely controversial long-term budget plan to remake Medicare and cut trillions in federal spending.\" Update at 8:38 a.m. ET. Ryan Is \"Honored.\" The first tweet at Ryan's new @PaulRyanVP Twitter page: \"I'm honored to join @MittRomney on America's Comeback Team.\" Update at 8:35 a.m. ET. Ryan To Say The GOP Team \"Will Restore The Dreams And Greatness Of This Country\": The Romney/Ryan campaign just released some excerpts of the remarks Ryan is set to make in Norfolk. Among them: \"Mitt Romney is a leader with the skills, the background and the character that our country needs at a crucial time in its history. Following four years of failed leadership, the hopes of our country, which have inspired the world, are growing dim; and they need someone to revive them. Governor Romney is the man for this moment; and he and I share one commitment: we will restore the dreams and greatness of this country.\" Update at 8:30 a.m. ET. Early Analyses: -- The New York Times says the choice of Ryan \"shakes up\" the campaign. -- To The Wall Street Journal, Romney's decision \"puts spending\" at the center of the campaign. -- According to Politico, \"Romney now has a chance to make the race about something big, rather than the petty squabbles that have dominated the general election so far.\" Update at 8:20 a.m. ET. Ryan's Timeline: Milwaukee's Journal Sentinel has substantial coverage of Ryan and background on him. It includes a timeline of the congressman's life, from his Jan. 29, 1970, birth in Janesville, Wis. Update at 8:10 a.m. ET. \"Most Daring Decision\" Of Romney's Political Career: The New Yorker's Ryan Lizza, who this month wrote a long profile of Ryan for the magazine, calls Romney's choice of the young congressman \"the most daring decision of [Romney's] political career.\" And, Lizza writes, \"the good thing about the Ryan pick is that the presidential campaign will instantly turn into a very clear choice between two distinct ideologies that genuinely reflect the core beliefs of the two parties.\" Update at 8:04 a.m. ET. \"America's Comeback Team\": The Romney campaign is touting the ticket as \"America's comeback team.\" It says the seven-term congressman has \"worked tirelessly ... to reign in federal spending and increase accountability to taxpayers.\" Update at 8:02 a.m. ET.

Stand with us today.\" Update at 7:55 a.m. ET. What The 'Ryan Budget' Does: The Wall Street Journal's Washington Wire blog runs through the key points of the much-discussed \"Ryan budget plan\" here. Two key points: -- \"It would spend $40.135 trillion over 10 years, compared with the $46.959 trillion the White House said its budget would spend over 10 years.\" -- \"[It] lowers tax rates and cuts tax breaks. But ... doesn't say which tax breaks would be targeted for new limits or elimination.\" Update at 7:45 a.m. ET. Ryan On Romney. Here's Ryan talking about Romney just before the former Massachusetts governor effectively sewed up the GOP nomination: \"I'm excited, I'm encouraged, I'm enthused, because in this man we have a person of conviction, we have a man with the right kind of experience, we have the right kind of leader we're going to need to get this country right and to get this country back on track, and I want to ask you fellow Wisconsinites to join me in welcoming who I hope becomes the next president of the United States, Governor Mitt Romney.\" Update at 7:40 a.m. ET. NPR Interview: In May 2011, Ryan sat down with NPR editors and correspondents. On The Two-Way, we led our live-blogging of that conversation with this: One day after assailing Democrats for what he says are their \"Medi-scare\" political tactics, the author of the Republican plan to remake Medicare and Medicaid and cut the federal deficits and debts made the case that so far Republicans are \"negotiating with ourselves\" on those key issues because Democrats are the ones that won't enter the debate. Update at 7:30 a.m. ET. Ryan Brings Risks And Rewards: Last month, Morning Edition reported that: \"Ryan has youth and experience, he's a conservative from a swing state, and he has big ideas and the policy chops to back them up. But the chairman of the House Budget Committee would not be the safest of choices. ... \"Ryan's pedigree is strong. He worked on the staffs of Kansas Sen. Sam Brownback and the late Republican luminary Jack Kemp. He won his own seat at 28, which means that now, at 42, he's a seasoned legislator. \"But it's Ryan's ideas that first catapulted him into political stardom. The budget plan he introduced in 2010, or the 'road map,' as he called it, ignited a major debate within Congress. ... \"Ryan's budget was instantly controversial. It called for sweeping cuts to social programs, and, most troubling for seniors, would have changed Medicare from a guaranteed benefit to a voucher program. \"Still, Republicans lined up behind it and rode the plan to a sweep of the House, giving Ryan the chairmanship of the Budget Committee. Within a few months, the House passed the Ryan budget (although the Senate did not). \"That's the kind of energy a Romney candidacy could use.\"",

There are many election-related books you could choose to help you endure the final months of the presidential race, from desk-pounding policy proposals to thick, shelf-crushing biographies. Or, you could turn to Sneaky Pie. Now, full disclosure, Sneaky Pie is a cat, and she's usually solving mysteries as the main character in Rita Mae Brown's bestselling Mrs. Murphy series. Brown is the author of almost 40 books, many of which feature animal protagonists. She's also written several standalone novels, including the groundbreaking lesbian novel, Ruby Fruit Jungle. by Rita Mae Brown Hardcover, 239 pages | Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How? She's also known as a political activist, devoted to civil rights, gay liberation and women's issues. In the 1960s, she had a famous run-in with the grand dame of second-wave feminism, Betty Friedan, over her exclusion of lesbians from the movement. Rita Mae Brown talked with Weekend Edition Sunday guest host Linda Wertheimer about her latest book and her affinity for animals. On why she likes writing about animals \"We share the Earth with them, and they have so many qualities superior to our own. For instance, a hound can smell time. There's no way any of us can do that. If you put your dog out in an acre, that dog would know who was on that acre ... maybe up to three days' time. If we put four cameras on every corner, we would still never know what that dog knows.\" On why Sneaky Pie runs for president \"She meets other animals and discovers that the water supply is being both polluted and drained [and] the Earth is being played out. And that means all animals will die, not just humans. She realizes that we need the voices of other creatures [and] not just human beings.\" On why she cares for animals \"I do a lot of rescue work and it is the joy of my life. All of those years in politics, I never got the satisfaction I got out of helping another living creature.\" On what books influenced her writing \"I was a classics major, so for me it was the plays of Aristophanes. In the fifth century B.C. in Athens, in the midst of a devastating war that ultimately destroyed Athens, he had the courage to write these screamingly funny plays against the power structure.

            "article_content": "President Obama wrapped up a two-day campaign trip through Colorado on Thursday.  AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Audie Cornish. MELISSA BLOCK, HOST: And I'm Melissa Block. President Obama barnstormed through Colorado today holding rallies in Pueblo and Colorado Springs. It's his second full day in the state, one of a handful of battlegrounds that could decide the November election. As NPR's Scott Horsley reports, the president touted his support for clean energy and reached out to Colorado's growing Latino population. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Mariachis and Mexican folk dancers helped entertain the crowd waiting for Mr. Obama at the Colorado State Fairgrounds in Pueblo. The president has a lot of fans in this part of the state, including Annie Backa(ph), who calls Mr. Obama one in a million. ANNIE BACKA: He sure likes Pueblo. He's been here more than one time. I think he likes the Mexican food. HORSLEY: Sure enough, Mr. Obama stopped off on his way to the fairgrounds at Romero's Restaurant, where he ordered some of the award-winning green chili. Backa says, during his time in office, Mr. Obama has helped a lot of people out of jams. She points to his rescue of the auto industry as one example. BACKA: We need to keep him in. Romney, I don't know. Romney's after the rich people and, like, we're poor. You know, what are you going to do? I'm rich in loving grandkids. HORSLEY: Mr. Obama's latest populist message is tailor-made for this audience. He blasted Romney's tax plan, which the independent tax policy center found would cut taxes for the wealthy while shifting the cost onto the middle class. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: We don't need tax cuts for folks who are doing really, really, really well. We need to keep taxes low for working Americans like you. (APPLAUSE) HORSLEY: The president defended a clean energy tax credit that Romney has marked to eliminate, saying without it, hundreds of jobs at a local wind turbine maker could be lost. He also contrasted Romney's hard line against illegal immigration with his own decision not to deport those brought to this country as children. OBAMA: A young person who comes to America, is brought here, is raised here, is friends with our kids, is going to school with our kids, is American in every single way except for a piece of paper, should have a chance to be a part of the American family. HORSLEY: Bookstore owner Susan Kreitz(ph) drove two hours from Lamar, Colorado, to attend the Pueblo rally. She sat near the stage wearing a crisp Obama T-shirt. SUSAN KREITZ: I bought that in 2008 and I don't wear it very often because I want to keep it nice, but it's my favorite. HORSLEY: The shirt shows Mr. Obama ripping open his suit jacket to expose a giant O, Superman style. Kreitz says that image still works for her. KREITZ: He does the best he can, but there's a heck of a lot of kryptonite in Washington, D.C. HORSLEY: Pueblo has long been a Democratic stronghold, but Mr. Obama's also campaigning in heavily Republican parts of the state, like Colorado Springs. Headquarters of Focus on the Family and a magnet for evangelicals. In 2008, Mr. Obama lost here by almost 20 points, but that was still better than John Kerry did four years earlier. Political scientist Seth Masket of the University of Denver says Mr. Obama is seeking votes even in hostile parts of the state. SETH MASKET: Historically, presidential campaigns have not spent a whole lot of effort trying to get those Democrats out. They just figure, well, it's a lost area. A high Democratic turnout in those areas - well, it's not going to make the county necessarily Democratic, but it could help flip the state. HORSLEY: It worked for Mr. Obama four years ago, when winning Colorado was icing on his national victory. He's hoping it'll work again now that every swing state counts.

The Labor Department reported Friday that employers added 163,000 net jobs last month but the unemployment rate rose to 8.3 percent. The stock market rallied on Friday's jobs report, with the Dow Jones industrial average jumping more than 200 points. But what do the numbers mean for the political stocks of President Obama and his Republican challenger, Mitt Romney? That's harder to measure. In our increasingly polarized country, Democrats and Republicans can choose from competing news outlets, competing think tanks, and this month at least competing reports from the Labor Department. Speaking near the White House on Friday, President Obama focused on the employment survey, which showed better-than-expected job gains in July. He noted that over the last 2 1/2 years, private employers have added 4.5 million jobs \u2014 more than a million this year alone. \"Those are our neighbors and family members finding work and the security that comes with work,\" Obama said. Romney, on the other hand, stressed the UNemployment rate, which inched up to 8.3 percent. At a campaign appearance in Las Vegas, Romney focused on the millions of Americans who've been unable to find full-time work. \"This continues a pattern of American families really struggling, having hard times, and the president's policies are to blame for not having gotten the economy back on track,\" Romney said. Forecasters were caught off guard both by the sharp jump in job growth and by the rise in the unemployment rate. But political handicapper Stuart Rothenberg of the Rothenberg Political Report doubts that either surprise was big enough to fundamentally change the political picture. \"Both sides have something to talk about with these numbers,\" he said. \"But overall, I'm not sure these numbers are so frightening to people that there is an added sense of doom out there.\" Polls continue to show a tight race nationally. But Rothenberg gives a tiny advantage --what he calls a \"pinky on the scale\" \u2014 to Obama. \"Mitt Romney needs a growing sense of gloom about the economy,\" Rothenberg said. \"He needs a series of bad numbers that will lead people to conclude that ... we're really going off the cliff here. And to the extent that the news is mixed or good at all, I think that hurts Romney between now and November.\" For economist Nariman Behravesh, the new numbers simply confirm the impression of the last few months: that the economy is growing but at a very sluggish rate. His firm, IHS Global Insight, uses that information to try to forecast the presidential election. For now, he says, we're in a holding pattern. Both sides have something to talk about with these numbers. But overall, I'm not sure these numbers are so frightening to people that there is an added sense of doom out there. Stuart Rothenberg of the Rothenberg Political Report \"The economy is not bad enough to create a strong case against Mr. Obama,\" he said. \"But it's certainly not Obama's friend.\" In the months to come, the candidates will try to rally support for their competing economic platforms. Romney argues that the president's health care law and financial regulations have discouraged hiring. Romney has promised to reverse them. \"The president has not had policies that put American families back to work. I do. I'll put them in place and get America working again,\" Romney said. Romney's plan includes big tax cuts, more domestic energy production and deeper cuts in government spending. Another 9,000 government jobs were shed last month, including about 7,000 teaching positions. Obama wants to spend more money keeping teachers on the payroll and boosting public works projects to employ out-of-work construction crews. He argues that Romney's tax proposal would shift the burden to the middle class \u2014 a claim supported this week by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. Obama calls Romney's proposals a rerun of trickle-down economics. \"We're not going to get to where we need to be if we go back to the policies that helped to create this mess in the first place,\" Obama said. \"And the last thing that we should be doing is asking middle-class families who are still struggling to recover from this recession to pay more in taxes.\" Expect to hear a lot more of these arguments in the next three months. Of course, polls tell us most voters have already made up their minds about the presidential race and that's the filter through which many will view the latest jobs report.",

            "article_content": "Job creation in July was better than in the previous months and better than expected. But Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney focused on the still-high unemployment rate in responding to the report today. President Obama said the report was a sign of progress in the economy.  AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Audie Cornish. A new report out today shows the best jobs growth in several months, but the unemployment rate stuck above eight percent - went up, not down. From opposite sides of the country, President Obama and Mitt Romney each reacted, playing up the parts of the report they liked. NPR's Brian Naylor has our story from Las Vegas, where Romney campaigned today. BRIAN NAYLOR, BYLINE: Speaking this morning at a North Las Vegas truck body shop, Romney wasted no time jumping on the July job numbers. With a white flatbed truck behind him, Romney said middle class families deserve better than 42 consecutive months of unemployment above eight percent. MITT ROMNEY: Today, we just got a new number from the unemployment report and it's another hammer blow to the struggling middle class families of America because the president has not had policies that put American families back to work. I do. I'll put them in place and get America working again. (APPLAUSE) NAYLOR: President Obama, meanwhile, saw the picture a little differently. Rather than focusing on the 8.3 percent unemployment rate, which was a slight increase from the previous month, the president preferred to look at the 163,000 new jobs created in July. That was a bit more than analysts were expecting. Speaking at the White House and flanked by a group of what he called hardworking middle class Americans, he conceded more needs to be done. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Let's acknowledge we've still got too many folks out there who are looking for work. We've got more work to do on their behalf, not only to reclaim all the jobs that were lost during the recession, but also to reclaim the kind of financial security that too many Americans have felt was slipping away from them for too long. NAYLOR: The monthly jobs numbers have become a short form report card for the economy, the key issue of the presidential campaign. Romney has campaigned the last two days in Colorado and Nevada, touting his plan for a stronger middle class. Speaking to reporters in Las Vegas, he left no doubt who he holds responsible for the continued struggles of the economy. ROMNEY: I think it's an extraordinary failure of policy, a failure of leadership and I think it's a moral failure for a country as successful and prosperous as our own to go now four years in a mode which feels to many people like a recession. I think there are some who have said if you're unemployed, it's a depression. NAYLOR: Romney declined to say whether he thought the economy was in a recession, but said it sure feels like it for the 23 million Americans he said were jobless or underemployed. Romney was also asked about charges from Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid that Romney has not paid taxes in recent years. Romney said he's paid taxes every year, a lot of taxes. Still, he says he will not release any of his income tax returns for years prior to 2010. Brian Naylor, NPR News, Las Vegas. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) Copyright \u00a9 2012 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "(Revised @ 1:48 pm ET) With only three monthly jobs reports left before Nov. 6, President Obama needs every piece of good economic news he can get to add to his argument for re-election. Friday's employment report certainly provided some. The Labor Department reported that the economy added an unexpectedly strong 163,000 jobs in July. Forecasters had predicted that the economy would add as many as 100,000 jobs, so the report took most everyone by surprise. But the Labor Department also reported that the jobless rate rose slightly to 8.3 percent from 8.2 percent. Statistically, that 10th of a percent didn't mean much, according to the Labor Department. Politically, however, it was significant, since the uptick allowed the president's opponents, particularly Republican rival Mitt Romney, to continue his argument that Obama has failed to turn around the economy and has no idea how to do so. In short, the report maintained the status quo of the presidential race. It suggested that the economic recovery was still intact, though weaker than any recovery since World War II. The upside wasn't so big as to have Democrats whistling \"Happy Days Are Here Again,\" nor the downside so bad as to make Republicans ever more confident of a Romney victory in November. James Thurber, director of the Center for Congressional & Presidential Studies, at American University, told It's All Politics: \"It certainly doesn't hurt Obama on the economy. It doesn't blow things away. But he's doing pretty well in the polls in several battleground states that are adding jobs, where unemployment rates are going down, like in Ohio. \"So this isn't super news but it's good news for Obama. And not so good news for Mitt Romney. It would have been better [for Obama] if they had created even more jobs, but that's quite a few jobs.\" With the election less than 100 days away now, voter perceptions of the economy are pretty much baked in, with only a small percent of the electorate still persuadable, according to Thurber. And the closer Election Day gets, the fewer voters will be in that group, with perhaps only 10 percent to 12 percent of voters still open to persuasion 30 days before the election, Thurber said. Thurber adds: \"So all these billions of dollars being spent are being spent on those people in those battleground states. A dramatic change in the economy, an improvement might change that slightly. And certainly if it gets negative dramatically, that could change it a little bit. \"But basically [a 10th of percentage point change in the jobless rate] is not going to make that much of a difference in that swing vote, in my opinion.\" Thurber cites the presidential election forecast models by political scientists like Alan Abramowitz at Emory University and others, like Nate Silver of the New York Times' FiveThirtyEight blog, which show Obama with a better than even chance for re-election based on economic data. Thurber's point: It would take a game changer of an event to really change the dynamics of those models. And Friday's jobs report was not a game-changer event. Not only are voter attitudes mostly baked in at his point, so are the presidential candidates and their campaigns, both of which sounded themes heard well before Friday. Speaking at an event at the White House, President Obama said: \"This morning, we learned that our businesses created 172,000 new jobs in the month of July. That means that we've now created 4.5 million new jobs over the last 29 months \u2014 and 1.1 million new jobs so far this year. Those are our neighbors and family members finding work, and the security that comes with work. \"But let's acknowledge, we've still got too many folks out there who are looking for work. We've got more work to do on their behalf \u2014 not only to reclaim all the jobs that were lost during the recession, but also to reclaim the kind of financial security that too many Americans have felt was slipping away from them for too long. \"And we knew when I started in this job that this was going to take some time. We haven't had to come back from an economic crisis this deep or this painful since the 1930s. But we also knew that if we were persistent, if we kept at it and kept working, that we'd gradually get to where we need to be. \"Here's the thing. We are not going to get there, we're not going to get to where we need to be if we go back to the policies that helped to create this mess in the first place. And the last thing that we should be doing is asking middle-class families who are still struggling to recover from this recession to pay more in taxes.\" Romney's campaign issued the following statement, quoting him: \"Today's increase in the unemployment rate is a hammer blow to struggling middle-class families. Yesterday I launched my Plan for a Stronger Middle Class that will bring more jobs and more take home pay. My plan will turn things around and bring the economy roaring back, with twelve million new jobs created by the end of my first term. President Obama doesn't have a plan and believes that the private sector is 'doing fine.' Obviously, that is not the case. We've now gone 42 consecutive months with the unemployment rate above eight percent. Middle class Americans deserve better, and I believe America can do better.\" By the way, Jim Tankersley, who covers the intersection of economics and politics for National Journal, has a piece that raises an important point. The nation has for more than a decade witnessed repeated jobless recoveries. There are structural reasons for this, as the economy has changed through offshoring and technology.

            "article_content": "Mitt Romney campaigned Thursday in Colorado, the first domestic appearances since returning from his trip to Europe and the Middle East. He huddled with Republican governors who heaped praise on him in Aspen, where he also held a fundraiser. And, NPR's Brian Naylor reports, he addressed a rally in a Denver suburb.  RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: With his much-publicized foreign trip behind him, Mitt Romney traveled yesterday to the swing state of Colorado. He huddled with Republican governors who he praised on him in Aspen, where he also held a fundraiser. The Republican candidate began his trip at a rally in the Denver suburb of Golden, which is where NPR's Brian Naylor begins his report. BRIAN NAYLOR, BYLINE: After a brief foray into foreign policy, Mitt Romney has returned his campaign's focus to more familiar turf, the economy. In his stops yesterday, the Republican candidate outlined a five-point plan he says will create more jobs and increase workers' take home pay - a plan for a stronger middle class. It involves some familiar GOP themes - more drilling for energy independence, promoting school choice and deficit reduction. Romney said the president has gone about it the wrong way. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) MITT ROMNEY: It's like a dog trying to chase its tail, you just don't ever get there. So the right answer is not to raise taxes, the right answer is to reduce government spending and finally create the incentives to put people back to work again and grow this economy. NAYLOR: Romney offered few specifics as to which government spending he would cut or how he would create incentives. But the middle class has increasingly become the theme of the presidential contest. President Obama released a new ad yesterday accusing Romney of wanting to cut taxes on the wealthy and pay for it by taking tax deductions away from middle income earners. The airwaves in Colorado are filled with ads from both candidates, as well as from outside groups, who see Colorado as very much in play this year after voting for Mr. Obama four years ago. There had been a brief hiatus in the ad wars in the aftermath of the shooting in Aurora, and Romney met with one of the massacre survivors yesterday. ROMNEY: I guess maybe by applause we show how united we are with the tragedy of those people - how much we love them, how much we care for them. (APPLAUSE) NAYLOR: Romney also took time for an appearance on Sean Hannity's radio show. He was asked about charges by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, who said he has been told by an unnamed investor at Bain Capital, Romney's old company, that Romney didn't pay any income taxes for 10 years. Romney hit back. (SOUNDBITE OF RADIO INTERVIEW) ROMNEY: Well, it's time for Harry to put up or shut up. Harry is going to have to describe who it is he spoke with because, of course, that's totally and completely wrong. It's untrue, dishonest and inaccurate. It's wrong. NAYLOR: Romney then flew over the Rockies to Aspen, where the nation's Republican governors have been meeting. Nine of them appeared on stage with the former Massachusetts governor, including several who have been mentioned as his running mate. The loudest cheers went to New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, who said Americans want a leader who's is willing to lead. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) GOVERNOR CHRIS CHRISTIE: And the president of the United States has been like a man walking around in a dark room looking for the light switch of leadership for the last four years. He hasn't found it yet. He's not going to find it in the next few months. NAYLOR: On his flight to Aspen, Romney was asked when a running mate choice might be made. I've got nothing for you, he said. In the meantime, his campaign released a white paper critical of the Obama administration's economic policies and promised an energy plan that Romney says will free North America from imported oil. The return to the states and to domestic issues seemed to re-energize the Romney camp, which had seemed off balance at times overseas. Today the candidate will appear in Nevada and on Saturday in Indiana, two more states he hopes to take back from the president in November. Brian Naylor, NPR News, Aspen, Colorado.

There were 163,000 more jobs on public and private payrolls last month, but the nation's unemployment rate edged up to 8.3 percent, the Bureau of Labor Statistics just reported. The jobs gain was the best in five months and was much better than the revised estimated of growth for June \u2014 a gain of just 64,000 jobs. But it wasn't good enough to keep the jobless rate from rising slightly. In June, it stood at 8.2 percent. We'll have more from the report, reactions to it and analyses as the morning continues. Click your \"refresh\" button to make sure you're seeing our latest updates. Update at 12:05 p.m. ET. Obama Focuses On Gains, Talks Taxes: Speaking at the White House, the president just started his remarks by noting that private employers have added 4.5 million jobs to their payrolls over the last 29 months. \"Those are our neighbors and family members finding new work,\" he said, while conceding that \"we've still got too many folks out there who are looking for work.\" Then he turned to again calling on Congress to extend the so-called Bush tax cuts for all Americans except those families earning more than $250,000 a year. Republicans have said they want to extend the cuts for everyone. They say that a still struggling economy could be hurt by effectively raising anyone's taxes. The president and his fellow Democrats say it's time to ask wealthy Americans to pay more as part of an effort to help trip future deficits. Update at 11:58 a.m. ET. Romney Says \"Real People\" Are Suffering: After repeating his earlier line about unemployment being a \"hammer blow to the struggling middle-class families of America,' Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney just told an audience in Las Vegas that \"real people [are] really suffering and having hard times\" in America today. He blamed what he says are the president's failed economic policies. If he's elected, Romney said, he will put in place policies that \"get America working again.\" (Our thanks to CNN.com, which streamed Romney's remarks.) Update at 11:40 a.m. ET. Obama, Romney To Speak: The president is about to make comments about the report \u2014 and to make his case about not extending the so-called Bush tax cuts for those earning more than $250,000 a year. And Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney is due to speak shortly at an event in Las Vegas. Update at 10 a.m. ET. Stocks Are Up: Wall Street seems to be taking the news well. The Dow Jones industrial average is up about 210 points (1.7 percent) after 30 minutes of trading. Update at 9:50 a.m. ET. Romney Says It's \"A Hammer Blow,\" White House Sees Positive Side: As we reported earlier, Republican presidential contender Mitt Romney called the increase in unemployment a \"hammer blow to struggling middle-class families.\" Now, White House economist Alan Krueger is out with his analysisand he begins by saying that \"while there is more work that remains to be done, today's employment report provides further evidence that the U.S. economy is continuing to recover from the worst downturn since the Great Depression.\" He adds that \"the economy has now added private sector jobs for 29 straight months, for a total of 4.5 million jobs during that period.\" Republicans such as House Speaker John Boehner, however, point out that the jobless rate has been above 8 percent for 42 months. Through July, President Obama has been in office for 42 months. Update at 9:30 a.m. ET. Taken A Little Further, Change In Jobless Rate Is Even Smaller: Crunching the numbers shows that the jobless rate last month was 8.25 percent if you carry it out another place \u2014 vs. 8.22 percent in June. That helps explain why BLS says the rate was \"essentially unchanged.\" Update at 9:20 a.m. ET. Politically, Report Cuts Both Ways. The Associated Press writes that: \"President Barack Obama got new figures Friday to buttress his argument that he's presiding over steady, if slow, economic growth. But the government's report that the overall rate of unemployment actually crept up to 8.3 percent allows Republican rival Mitt Romney to keep pressure on Obama to defend his record.\" CBS News' Mark Knoller says Romney has characterized the rise in the jobless rate as being \"a hammer blow to struggling middle-class families.\" Update at 9:10 a.m. ET. About 7 Million Have Been Out Of Work A Long Time: In July there were 6.9 million people who had been unemployed 15 weeks or longer, BLS says. That was down from 7.2 million in June. Update at 9:05 a.m. ET. Where The Gains Were: The sector with the biggest increase in jobs \u2014 49,000 \u2014 was \"professional and business services,\" BLS says. That sector includes jobs in the legal profession, accounting, computer systems, temporary help and administration. The education and health services sectors added 38,000 jobs. Restaurants and \"drinking places\" increased employment by 29,400 positions. There was a 25,000-increase in the manufacturing sector. Update at 9:03 a.m. ET. \"A Good Number\": \"This is a good number, it's well above expectations,\" economist Hugh Johnson tells our Newscast Desk, referring to the jobs increase. Update at 9 a.m. ET. Republican Reaction: \"Last week Obama said his jobs plan worked. With unemployment going up yet again, it's obvious it hasn't & he's out of ideas,\" tweets Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus. Update at 8:55 a.m. ET. Some Early Analyses: -- \"The latest payroll numbers are encouraging after three months of weak job creation, but the figures still aren't enough to lower the unemployment rate, and hiring remains well below the pace set at the start of the year.\" (The Wall Street Journal) -- \"Uneven hiring may hold back consumer spending, the biggest part of the economy, as a global slowdown and impending U.S. tax changes weigh on businesses.\" (Bloomberg News) -- Though job growth picked up, the increase in the unemployment rate means that investors will still be anticipating some type of move by the Federal Reserve to give the economy a boost. (Reuters) Update at 8:52 a.m. ET. News Was Basically Better Than Expected: As we reported earlier, economists had expected to hear that 100,000 jobs were added to payrolls. They also thought BLS would say the jobless rate had remained 8.2 percent. Update at 8:48 a.m. ET. Fewer \"Discouraged\" Workers: One reason the unemployment rate can rise even as more jobs are added to payrolls is that if more people decide to start looking for work again that adds to the size of the labor force. One way to measure that type of change is to look at \"discouraged workers\" \u2014 those who aren't looking for jobs because they don't think there are any to find. According to BLS, \"there were 852,000 discouraged workers in July, a decline of 267,000 from a year earlier.\" That could be a sign of increased optimism about the labor market. Update at 8:42 a.m. ET. Job Growth Averaging Around 150,000 A Month: According to BLS, \"since the beginning of this year, employment growth has averaged 151,000 per month, about the same as the average monthly gain of 153,000 in 2011.\" At that pace, however, there aren't enough new jobs being added to bring down the unemployment rate. It has stayed in a narrow range \u2014 from 8.1 percent to 8.3 percent \u2014 this year. The rate recently peaked at 10 percent in October 2009. It hasn't been below 8 percent since January 2009. Update at 8:38 a.m. ET. June Jobs Gain Revised Down: When BLS first reported about the month of June, it estimated there had been 80,000 jobs added to payrolls. Now, it puts the gain that month at 64,000.",

In his first campaign speech since returning from his trip abroad, Republican Mitt Romney on Thursday told an audience in the swing state of Colorado that President Obama has failed on the economy. And he wielded a scorecard to make his point. \"His policies have not worked,\" Romney said in Golden, Colo., outside Denver. \"They have not gotten America back to work again. My policies will work.\" Obama spent much of the day in battleground Florida before a planned evening trip to another swing state, Virginia. For the second day in a row, Obama assaulted Romney's plan for cutting taxes if he were to become president, citing an analysis by the Tax Policy Center that says the Romney plan would help the wealthiest Americans but cost those in the middle class, an analysis that Romney's campaign has called biased.

And guess what? It didn't work then. It will not work now.\" The battle over economic principles resumed a give-and-take from before Romney's weeklong trip to England, Israel and Poland. And it came a day before the Labor Department releases its monthly jobs report, sure to amp up the focus. In Colorado, Romney audience members received a copy of what he called the \"presidential accountability scorecard,\" rating the two candidates on six areas including jobs, home prices and family income. \"When the president was here as a candidate accepting the nomination four years ago, he laid out the report card in which he hoped to be judged,\" Romney said, referring to Obama's 2008 Democratic nomination acceptance speech in Denver. During that speech, Obama discussed what he considered to be the differences in the way Republicans and Democrats measured success. Obama said at the time: \"We measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the Fortune 500, but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a new business.\" Romney attacked Obama's record, alluding to comments the president made earlier this month about how small businesses are built (and which the Obama campaign says have been taken out of context): \"I hope he understands that actually the people that have a good idea and start a business are the ones who actually build the business,\" Romney said. \"We're at a 30-year low in the number of business start-ups that have occurred, a 30-year low, perhaps because he thinks government is the one that helps build businesses as opposed to people.\"",

            "article_content": "A new study by some prominent tax analysts looks at how much Mitt Romney would have to reorder the tax code in order to make the tax cuts he proposes. As NPR's Ari Shapiro reports, that became a rallying cry for President Obama during a pair of campaign stops in Ohio Wednesday.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: It's MORNING EDITION, from NPR News. I'm Steve Inskeep. RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: And I'm Renee Montagne. A damaging analysis has worked out the implications of Mitt Romney's plan to change the tax code. Romney says if elected, he would cut taxes, and do it in a way that does not expand the federal deficit. INSKEEP: So some prominent tax experts asked what would happen if a plan like Romney's was revenue-neutral - that  means that if one person's taxes go down, somebody else's would have to go up - and the Tax Policy Center said the Republican candidate would have to eliminate popular provisions that help middle-income Americans. MONTAGNE: Which provided ammunition for President Obama, as he campaigned yesterday in Ohio. NPR's Ari Shapiro was there. ARI SHAPIRO, BYLINE: Lots of candidates promise to cut taxes without saying how they'll pay for it. Mitt Romney also promises not to grow the deficit. So the authors of this study wanted to figure out where the money could come from. They started with the top of the tax code, getting rid of write-offs for the rich. WILLIAM GALE: So then we started eliminating tax expenditures for progressively lower-income households until we raised enough revenue to pay for the tax cuts. SHAPIRO: William Gale co-authored this study. He's part of the Tax Policy Center, a joint effort of the Brookings Institution and the Urban Institute. He says there's just no way to make the numbers work without hurting people in the middle. GALE: And so the outcome then is that net taxes on middle-income households go up, while net taxes on high-income households fall. SHAPIRO: Gale worked on the Council of Economic Advisors for the first President Bush. His co-author, Adam Looney, had a similar role in the Obama administration. The Romney campaign argues that this Obama taint disqualifies the study as liberal. But during the Republican primaries, Romney's campaign treated the Tax Policy Center differently. When that group assessed Rick Perry's tax proposal, Romney put out a press release praising its nonpartisan, objective third-party analysis, all of which became fodder yesterday for President Obama. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: They found that if Governor Romney wants to keep his word and pay for this plan, then he'd have to cut tax breaks that middle-class families depend on to pay for your home, the home mortgage deduction, to pay for your health care, the health care deduction. SHAPIRO: In Mansfield, Ohio, President Obama said this is part of a Romney pattern: hurting people who need help and helping those who are doing just fine. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) OBAMA: He's asking you to pay more so that people like him can get a big tax cut. SHAPIRO: Romney's tax plan was not the only focus of the president's Ohio visit. About one in eight Ohio residents works in the auto industry, and in Akron, the president said he can take credit for its rebirth. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) OBAMA: They counted the auto industry out, and now it's coming back stronger than ever, right here in Ohio and all across the country. SHAPIRO: A new TV ad from the Romney campaign tells it differently. The spot blames the Obama administration for closing car dealerships during the restructuring. (SOUNDBITE OF POLITICAL ADVERTISEMENT) UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Well, we had 30-some employees out of work. My wife and I were the last ones there. You know, it was like the dream that we worked for and that we worked so hard for was gone. SHAPIRO: On Air Force One, Obama campaign spokeswoman Jen Psaki said the Romney campaign has it backwards: the president actually saved almost a million auto industry jobs. JEN PSAKI: And, you know, Mitt Romney is the same person who wrote an op-ed saying let Detroit go bankrupt. If we had done that, if the country had done that, if the president had done that, it would have been disastrous for not only Ohio, but the country. SHAPIRO: This is a potent debate in towns like Mansfield, where retiree Rosemary Martin knows plenty of autoworkers. ROSEMARY MANSFIELD: My deceased husband worked at GM for years, and we had a good life. And I really feel bad for the people in this town that the GM plant is not here anymore. But I do believe that President Obama is doing all he can for the middle class and the auto industry, especially. SHAPIRO: That sentiment comes across in a new poll of three important swing states. The New York Times, CBS, and Quinnipiac survey gives the president a lead in Ohio, Pennsylvania and Florida, where he campaigns today. Ari Shapiro, NPR News, traveling with the president.

In Ohio on Wednesday, President Obama tried to make Mitt Romney the poster child for tax unfairness and the widening gulf between the middle class and very rich, wielding a new analysis of the Republican's fiscal proposals like a prosecutor with a fresh-in-hand grand jury indictment. In Obama's latest visit to the battleground state, he argued that voters view the election as a choice between a president who is a defender of the middle class and a challenger who isn't. The most recent Ohio polls either give Obama a slight lead or show the race as a statistical tie. The new analysis at the heart of Obama's attack on Romney came from the Tax Policy Center, a joint project of two left-leaning think tanks, the Urban Institute and Brookings Institution. Noting that the assessment came not from his White House aides but from what he characterized as \"an independent, nonpartisan organization,\" Obama told the audience at a campaign event in Mansfield: \"Now, despite the evidence, the entire centerpiece of my opponent's economic plan is a new $5 trillion tax cut on top of the Bush tax cuts. \"Now, the bulk of this tax cut would go to the very top, a lot of it going to the wealthiest one percent of all households. Folks making more than $3 million a year, the top one-tenth of one percent, would get a tax cut worth almost a quarter of a million dollars. \"Now, think about that. Folks making $3 million or more a year would get a quarter of a million dollar tax cut. But listen, it gets worse. Under my opponent's plan, who do you think gets the bill for these $250,000 tax cuts? You do! Then Obama reminded his listeners that Romney \u2014 and Obama himself \u2014 are among the wealthy who would benefit the most from the proposed tax cuts: \"That means the average middle-class family with children, according to this study, would be hit with a tax increase of more than $2,000. And here's the thing, he's not asking you to contribute more to pay down the deficit. He's not asking you to pay more to invest in our children's education or rebuild our roads or put more folks back to work. He's asking you to pay more so people like him can get a big tax cut. \"In order to afford just one $250,000 tax cut for somebody like Mr. Romney, 125 families like yours would have to pay another $2,000 in taxes every year. Does that sound like a good plan for economic growth? Does that sound like a plan you can afford? \"How many of you want to pay another $2,000 to give Mr. Romney or me another tax break? Ohio, we do not need more tax cuts for folks who are already doing really well. We need tax cuts for working Americans. We need tax cuts for families who are trying to raise their children and keep them healthy. And send them to college and put a roof over their heads. We don't need more tax cuts for companies that are shipping jobs overseas. We need tax cuts for companies that are creating jobs right here in America. \"That's the choice in this election. That's why I'm running for a second term as president of the United States. Mansfield, I've got a different plan for America than Mr. Romney's.\" Obama's message seemed aimed at underscoring what polls have indicated \u2014 that voters feel he understands them more than Romney does. Romney's campaign rejected the president's characterization of its candidate's plan as well as the Tax Policy Center analysis. A Romney campaign official questioned the objectivity of the analysis since one of its authors, Adam Looney, worked in the Obama administration as a staffer on the Council of Economic Advisers and in the Treasury Department. In fairness, another of the authors, William Gale, was a staff economist on the Council of Economic Advisers during the first Bush administration. Also, Romney's campaign itself called the TPC \"nonpartisan\" in a November news release to pass along criticism that then-presidential candidate Texas Gov. Rick Perry's economic plan would raise the tax burden on middle-class income earners. The Romney campaign on Wednesday persisted in trying to drive home the message that the contest was really a referendum and, as such, Obama deserves to be booted from office as a failure. Romney's campaign counterprogrammed Obama's visit with two ads \u2014 one that showed a man identified as Al Zarzour, a former GM dealership owner in Lyndhurst, Ohio, who was put out of business by GM. The ad links Zarzour's plight with the federal bailout of the U.S. auto industry. Obama campaign spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters that the president's actions saved a million auto industry jobs, 2,200 at Ohio car dealerships themselves. She added: \"And Mitt Romney is the same person who wrote an op-ed saying, 'Let Detroit go bankrupt.' If we had done that, if the country had done that, if the president had done that, it would have been disastrous for not only Ohio but the country.\" Indeed, Romney wasn't the only conservative who at the time of the auto bailout called for U.S. automakers to go through the bankruptcy process as a way to strip them of financially untenable commitments to the car makers' constituencies, including retirees and dealers. In a piece for the Heritage Foundation, a right-leaning think tank, Andrew Grossman wrote in 2009: \"According to industry analysts, General Motors needs to shed nearly 5,000 dealers from its network and eliminate five or six of its eight domestic brands. Without these changes, the company will be unable to compete with the likes of Toyota and Honda, which focus their energies on fewer brands and sell far more cars per dealer. Ford and Chrysler face the same problem. \"Making these changes outside of bankruptcy, however, would likely prove impossible. Automobile dealers wield enormous political clout at the state level and have succeeded in winning passage of tough pro-dealer 'franchise' laws in all 50 states. These laws make it slow and prohibitively expensive for an automaker to modernize its dealership network and consolidate redundant brands. Automakers that are already on the brink of insolvency cannot afford the time and expense that reforming their sales operations under these laws would involve.\" Besides the car dealer ad, Romney's campaign issued another video Wednesday called \"Time for a Change,\" which also happened to be in the lyrics of the blues-tune soundtrack. Against images of a down-on-its-luck Akron appears text, including, \"Under President Obama's 'plan' 41 months of unemployment above 8%\"; \"473,000 jobs lost\"; and \"23 million Americans struggling for work.\" The ad was the Romney campaign's way of \"greeting\" the president during his visit to Akron, his second Ohio stop.",

            "article_content": "President Obama was in New Orleans Wednesday to address the National Urban League, a largely African-American crowd and a key constituency for his re-election campaign. Obama spoke of the need to broaden economic opportunity, but he also took the occasion to call for steps to control gun violence in the wake of last week's shootings in Aurora, Colo.  RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: In the wake of massacre at a \"Batman\" movie premiere in Colorado, both President Obama and his Republican rival, Mitt Romney, avoided the highly charged subject of gun control. That changed last night. When asked about the Colorado shooting in an interview with NBC, Romney said tougher gun laws are not the answer. Meanwhile, President Obama said more needs to be done to stop gun violence, but he offered no specific proposals in his address to the National Urban League meeting in New Orleans. It's a largely African-American crowd in a key constituency for his re-election campaign. And it's a crowd that welcomed the president's main message, which focused on economic opportunity. Here's NPR's Pam Fessler. PAM FESSLER, BYLINE: Crowds don't get much friendlier than this one. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Hello Urban League. (SOUNDBITE OF CROWD CHEERING) OBAMA: Thank you. FESSLER: If there's been any weakening of black voter supporter for the president over the past four years, it was nowhere in sight last night. Several thousand people waiting in line for hours, many arriving in a torrential downpour to see Mr. Obama, and to hear what he had to say, especially about jobs, although he mostly talked about opportunity. OBAMA: That idea that everybody should have a fair shot, not just some. That this country is special because it has grown this magnificent middle class and has provided ladders of access for those striving to get into the middle class. FESSLER: He said his administration has taken steps to help businesses owned by African-Americans and to boost education. He said college should be affordable for all students so they don't graduate saddled with debt. That was a remark that drew loud applause from the hundreds of teens in the audience. (APPLAUSE) OBAMA: Of course, that means all of y'all got to hit the books. (APPLAUSE) OBAMA: I'm just saying. Don't - don't cheer and then you didn't do your homework. FESSLER: He warned them that they'll be competing with a lot of young people, especially from China and India. OBAMA: You know, they're not hanging out. They're not getting over. They're not playing video games. They're not watching \"Real Housewives.\" I'm just saying, it's a two-way street.  You've got to earn success. FESSLER: On a more serious note, the president also talked about the need to control gun violence. Not only the kind that took 12 lives last week in Colorado, but the kind that routinely takes lives in many of the nation's cities. He called for tighter controls on who can buy a gun and said parents and other adults need to spend more time with troubled youth. OBAMA: We should leave no stone unturned, and recognize that we have no greater mission as a country than keeping our young people safe. FESSLER: The president's remarks came at the end of a three-day campaign swing that included several fundraisers. Republican presidential hopeful Mitt Romney was also invited to speak, but he went on an overseas trip. Most black voters are clearly in the Obama camp, and Kevin Willhoite of Atlanta says he has no doubt, he'll turn out in November. KEVIN WILLHOITE: We're not asleep, and we can read between the lines, and so we know that he has done all that he could possibly do, and he needs another four years.

Obama said Romney's tax plans would create 800,000 jobs \u2014 overseas.\n                \n                    \n                    Susan Walsh/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption President Obama rips into his all-but-certain GOP foe, Mitt Romney, during a stop Monday at the Cincinnati Music Hall. Obama said Romney's tax plans would create 800,000 jobs \u2014 overseas. As the presidential campaigns continue to ramp up their attacks (see: felon, liar, outsourcing), the candidates are homing in this week on the country's electoral fertile crescent. President Obama held a town hall-style rally Monday in Cincinnati, and GOP candidate Mitt Romney is planning to head to Pennsylvania on Tuesday and follow the president to the Buckeye State on Wednesday. While Pennsylvania remains an important Obama-leaning swing state, no state will be more crucial to a November victory than Ohio and its 18 electoral votes. As he has in his previous forays to Ohio, including a two-day bus tour earlier this month, Obama characterized the voters there as the tiebreakers in what promises to be an exceedingly close race. \"The choice,\" Obama told the friendly, boisterous crowd at the Cincinnati Music Hall, \"is up to you.\" (Granted, Obama has been suggesting the same to non-Ohio voters. But the assertion resonates a bit more in this high-stakes state that tops almost every prognosticator's list \u2014 followed by Virginia, Pennsylvania and Florida \u2014 as the most likely to tip the election one way or the other.) On Monday, Obama intensified his attacks on Romney's tax plan with a claim that it would create 800,000 jobs \u2014 overseas. Seizing on an economist's analysis that a Romney-supported tax exemption on profits earned overseas by U.S. corporations would lead to a huge job shift overseas, Obama doubled down on his campaign's Romney-as-job-outsourcer claim: \"Today we found out there's a new study out by nonpartisan economists that says Gov. Romney's economic plan would, in fact, create 800,000 jobs. There's only one problem: The jobs wouldn't be in America. \"They'd be in other countries. By eliminating taxes on corporations' foreign income, Gov. Romney's plan would actually encourage companies to shift more of their operations to foreign tax havens, creating 800,000 jobs in those other countries. \"Now, this shouldn't be a surprise, because Gov. Romney's experience has been investing in what were called \"pioneers\" of the business of outsourcing. Now he wants to give more tax breaks to companies that are shipping jobs overseas.\" The GOP response? That the analyst who wrote the report, Kimberly Clausing, is an Obama supporter and campaign contributor. And the president's own Export Council has also supported the so-called territorial tax system changes endorsed by Romney. But Obama, who won Ohio in 2008 with just over 51 percent of the vote, drew applause and laughter from the receptive crowd in Hamilton County, the lone blue county in far southwest Ohio. He asserted that government loans to the auto industry, which Romney opposed, saved that sector, which accounts for 1 in 8 jobs in Ohio. And he touted tax cuts during his administration that he says eased the tax burden of middle-class families by $3,600. In 2008, Obama won the big-vote county, which borders Indiana and Kentucky, with 52 percent of the vote. He lost the three surrounding counties to GOP Sen. John McCain by big margins. Republican George W. Bush won the state in 2000 and 2004. But in 2008, there was a 6-percentage-point swing toward the Democratic column. Obama ran about 2.6 percentage points ahead of where Kerry was in 2004, and McCain ran 3.6 points behind where Bush finished four years earlier. This time around, the improving economic conditions in Ohio are expected to cut into Romney's argument that Obama has failed to revive the economy. The state's unemployment rate, which was as high as 10.6 percent in the last half of 2009, now sits at 7.3 percent. The national average is 8.2 percent. And local officials say manufacturing is returning to levels not seen in a decade. And for months, Republican Gov. John Kasich has been touting the state's jobs recovery. Between May 2011 and May 2012, the number of employees on nonfarm payrolls in Ohio increased by 75,700, according to seasonally adjusted numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That included 21,600 new manufacturing jobs. Around the time Obama was speaking Monday, Kasich tweeted: \"Good news for NE OH. Maines picked OH over MD for their expansion. That means new jobs and investment.\" Maines is a paper and food service company that broke ground Monday for an expansion in Ohio. Romney no doubt hopes to use his forays into Pennsylvania and Ohio to change the current conversation about his time as a private equity capitalist and his reluctance to release a full complement of tax returns. His campaign has branded this new phase, \"Obama's Political Payoffs Versus Middle-Class Layoffs.\"",

            "article_content": "While the presidential campaigns traded attack ads on Friday, President Obama was on the road in Virginia. The state is a prime target for both candidates.  MELISSA BLOCK, HOST: This is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED, from NPR News. I'm Melissa Block.  It's Friday, and we'll begin the hour with the week in politics. The presidential campaigns are trading barbs over Republican Mitt Romney's role at his private equity firm Bain Capital. Specifically, when did he stop managing the company? SEC filings appear to contradict Romney's claim that he ended his active management role in 1999, when he left to run the Salt Lake City Olympics. For the Obama campaign, it's an opportunity to try to sully Romney's business record, and to attack him for a lack of transparency regarding his personal finances. Romney's camp has fired back, arguing that the president is simply trying to distract voters from a lackluster economy. We'll talk with our political commentators about this latest dust-up after a report from NPR's Scott Horsley. He's riding along on President Obama's two-day campaign tour of Virginia. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: President Obama didn't utter the name Bain Capital when he campaigned today in Virginia Beach - though he has said in the past, Mitt Romney's business background is fair game since that's what the Republican challenger sites as his main qualification for the White House. Today, Mr. Obama tried to present himself as standing above the political mudslinging; instead, focusing on pocketbook issues like taxes and health insurance. At a high school in a heavily African-American neighborhood, the president renewed his call to extend Bush-era tax cuts for families making less than a quarter-million dollars a year. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Now is not the time to raise taxes on the middle class. The economy is still fragile. We're still digging ourselves out of this hole. So let's provide certainty to 98 percent of Americans. HORSLEY: Republicans want to extend tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans, too; a move that Mr. Obama says would add to the government's red ink without doing much to boost the economy. OBAMA: You say you want to bring down the deficit, but you're not willing to let tax cuts lapse for the top 2 percent. It tells me you're not serious about deficit reduction. HORSLEY: The president also defended his signature health-care plan, which Romney criticized this week in a speech to the NAACP.  Virginia Beach business owner Damian May (ph) watched that speech, and says he was puzzled by Romney's opposition to the health-care plan. As a taxpayer, May says he wants to see more people covered by health insurance. DAMIAN MAY: Who pays for it when you go to the hospital, and you don't have insurance? We still pay for it. I want you to be able to pay for it 'cause I don't want to pay for it. HORSLEY: Romney himself used to make a similar argument. Today, he argues the health-care law is discouraging employers from hiring workers, and he's promised a full repeal. Scott Horsley, NPR News, Virginia Beach. Copyright \u00a9 2012 NPR.

            "article_content": "A day after Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney spoke to the nation's oldest civil right organization, Vice President Joe Biden appeared at the NAACP's annual convention. He quickly tackled one issue that drew Romney sustained boos \u2014 the 2010 health care overhaul. Biden appeared in place of President Obama, who made a brief videotaped address thanking the group for its work. He walked out to warm applause, and several of his remarks were interrupted by shouts of agreement. When he mentioned what he sees as the benefits of the health care law, the shouts changed to roars of approval. Biden declared that 8 million black Americans now have health care insurance under the new law, and thanked Obama for his leadership. Biden spelled out further differences between Obama's campaign and Romney's on health care, the environment, equal pay for women and education. He claimed Romney's tax reforms are skewed for the wealthy at the expense of domestic programs that help less affluent people. Biden asserted more than 2 million black Americans will see their taxes go up under the tax plan Romney is proposing. As NPR's Liz Halloran reports, when Romney yesterday said President Obama blamed the rich for economic problems and contrasted his own efforts as helping the middle class: \"The audience reaction? Crickets.\" But Biden's hugest response came on voter ID laws, a subject the civil rights group is keenly tracking. Romney did not address the matter yesterday. After discussing the NAACP's long history of fighting for African Americans' right to vote, Biden queried, \"did you think we'd be fighting these battles again?\" Biden said ballot access should be \"expanded and unencumbered\". Then he recalled his years in the Senate, where he worked with the GOP on voting issues like motor voter, early voting and voting by mail. But times have changed, he said, adding: \"This ain't your father's Republican party.\" The vice president concluded by urging convention delegates to imagine a changed Justice Department under a President Romney. And he warned Romney would make substantial changes to the Supreme Court.",

Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney didn't expect a warm embrace when he took the stage Wednesday at the NAACP annual convention in Houston. And he didn't get one. But the former Massachusetts governor managed to absorb sustained booing after he said he'd eliminate \"Obamacare\" if elected, and delivered a speech that reached out \u2014 a bit \u2014 to African-Americans, while remaining consistent with his conservative campaign themes. His pitch to members of the nation's oldest civil rights group boiled down to this: Given the economic and educational problems that still beset the black community, has historic and overwhelming loyalty to the Democratic Party really paid off? \"When decades of the same promises keep producing the same failures, then it's reasonable to rethink our approach \u2014 and consider a new plan,\" Romney said. He touted his support of charter schools and vouchers, views not unlike those of the Obama administration, and attempted to dismiss the notion that his campaign was about helping the rich. \"The president wants to make this a campaign about blaming the rich,\" he said. \"I want to make this a campaign about helping the middle class.\" The audience reaction? Crickets. Romney did not touch the issue of voter ID laws that opponents see as conservative efforts to suppress the nonwhite vote. And Romney was careful to acknowledge President Obama's historic election. But he segued into a laundry list of economic data, including the 14.4 percent unemployment rate in the black community, and suggested, if obliquely, that the nation's first black president had failed them. \"If equal opportunity in America were an accomplished fact, then a chronically bad economy would be equally bad for everyone,\" Romney said. \"Instead, it's worse for African-Americans in almost every way.\" Romney wrapped himself in the civil rights record of his late father, Michigan Gov. George Romney, and closed without a mention of his Mormon faith, but on a strong religious note. \"Every good cause on this Earth relies in the end on a plan better than ours,\" Romney said, and then quoted the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.: \"Without dependence on God, our efforts turn to ashes and our sunrises into darkest night.\" Mitt Romney tells the NAACP convention he would eliminate \"Obamacare.\" Even the moment he was booed (did Romney's speechwriters deliberately choose the freighted word \"Obamacare\"?) seemed calibrated to resonate with voters outside the walls of the convention hall. How so? -- Even polls taken after the Supreme Court upheld most of Obama's health care law show that at least half of Americans still oppose the legislation. -- His strong case for school choice, including a proposal to have federal money \"linked to a student, so that parents can send their child to any public or charter school, or to a private school, where permitted,\" appeals to some corners of the African-American electorate. But it is aimed directly at Romney's conservative base. -- He slipped in a quick reference to note his party-consistent opposition to same-sex marriage, which Obama and the NAACP have endorsed, but which remains an issue that has caused divisions in the black community. \"As president,\" he said, to some applause, \"I will promote strong families \u2014 and I will defend traditional marriage.\" -- He doubled down on his jobs message, including his stated aim to reduce government spending by eliminating \"expensive nonessential programs like Obamacare.\" He cited a Chamber of Commerce members' survey (if audience eye-rolling could be heard, there would have been noise at his invocation of the powerful business network) suggesting that the health care law would make three-quarters of them less likely to hire people. Peeling off African-American voters, more than 95 percent of whom voted for Obama in 2008, has always been a long shot for Republicans \u2014 even without an African-American incumbent in the White House. Romney acknowledged that reality, but said he's not counting anybody out. \"I have no hidden agenda,\" he said. \"If you want a president who will make things better in the African-American community, you are looking at him.\" He left the stage a short time later, alone, and to a smattering of polite applause. In a statement after the speech, NAACP President Benjamin Todd Jealous said: \"While we are glad that Governor Romney recognized the power of the black electorate, he laid out an agenda that was antithetical to many of our interests. His criticism of the Affordable Care Act \u2014 legislation that will improve access to quality health care for millions \u2014 signals his fundamental misunderstanding of the needs of many African Americans.\" NAACP Chairman Roslyn M. Brock said of Romney: \"We appreciate that he was courageous and took the opportunity to speak with us directly.\"",

Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney told the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People this morning that his policies would be good for all Americans and that those of President Obama have not helped the nation's poorest people. And, he told delegates to the NAACP's annual convention in Houston, \"if it were possible to fully communicate what I believe is in the real, enduring best interest of African-American families, you would vote for me for president.\" The former governor of Massachusetts drew some boos when he repeated his pledge to repeal \"Obamacare,\" and some jeers when he said he could make things better for African-Americans. But overall, NPR's Don Gonyea reported from the scene, he was politely received. Romney pledged to return to the organization's annual convention next year if he's elected. Our original post and earlier updates: Excerpts from the address that Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney plans to give this morning at the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People's annual convention in Houston were just released by his campaign. Some highlights (we added bold to serve as reference points): -- \"I believe that if you understood who I truly am in my heart, and if it were possible to fully communicate what I believe is in the real, enduring best interest of African-American families, you would vote for me for president.\" -- He got elected governor of Democrat-dominated Massachusetts by making his case \"to every voter. We don't count anybody out, and we sure don't make a habit of presuming anyone's support. Support is asked for and earned \u2014 and that's why I'm here today.\" -- \"I am running for president because I know that my policies and vision will help hundreds of millions of middle class Americans of all races, will lift people from poverty, and will help prevent people from becoming poor. My campaign is about helping the people who need help. The course the president has set has not done that \u2014 and will not do that. My course will.\" -- \"If equal opportunity in America were an accomplished fact, then a chronically bad economy would be equally bad for everyone. Instead, it's worse for African Americans in almost every way. ... Americans of every background are asking when this economy will finally recover \u2014 and you, in particular, are entitled to an answer.\" -- \"If equal opportunity in America were an accomplished fact, black families could send their sons and daughters to public schools that truly offer the hope of a better life. Instead, for generations, the African-American community has been waiting and waiting for that promise to be kept.\" -- \"I will give the parents of every low-income and special needs student the chance to choose where their child goes to school. For the first time in history, federal education funds will be linked to a student, so that parents can send their child to any public or charter school, or to a private school, where permitted.\" -- \"Should I be elected president, I'll lead as I did when governor. I will look for support wherever there is good will and shared conviction. I will work with you to help our children attend better schools and help our economy create good jobs with better wages.\" Romney is scheduled to start speaking around 10:30 a.m. ET. We'll watch for more news from his address. Later, our colleagues at It's All Politics plan to weigh in. Vice President Biden is due to address the NAACP on Thursday. Update at 11:06 a.m. ET. He Promises To Come Back: He won't always agree with the NAACP, Romney says, but \"your hospitality to me today will be returned. We will know one another.\" If he's elected president, adds the candidate, and he's invited to address the group again, \"my answer will be yes.\" President Obama, reports White House press corps unofficial historian Mark Knoller of CBS News, last attended the organization's annual convention in 2009. Update at 11 a.m. ET. And Some Jeers: According to NPR's Don Gonyea, when Romney said that \"if you want a president who can make things better in the African-American community you're looking at him,\" the words were \"not well received.\" Some jeers or catcalls could he heard. Update at 10:57 a.m. ET. Some Boos: There were some boos from the audience when Romney just repeated his promise to repeal \"Obamacare.\" But, NPR's Don Gonyea says on his Twitter page as he reports from the NAACP convention, \"Romney [is] getting polite applause. Mostly. Biggest react though was boos and murmurs when he said he'd get rid of Obamacare.\" Update at 10:50 a.m. ET. Romney Says The Rich Will Be OK, With Or Without Him; He Wants To Help Others: It's \"nonsense\" to say his policies would only help the rich or that he's only interested in helping the wealthy, Romney says as he begins his remarks. And they don't need him: \"The rich will do just fine,\" he adds, \"whether I'm elected or not.\"",

            "article_content": "GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney is in Houston Wednesday to address a convention of the NAACP. On Tuesday, he was in Colorado, one of the most hotly contested swing states. Romney, who unexpectedly lost to Rick Santorum in the Colorado caucuses earlier this year, is working to shore up support among the GOP base  DON GONYEA, BYLINE: This is Don Gonyea, travelling with Mitt Romney, who made two stops yesterday in Colorado - a state that went easily for President Obama in 2008 and which is considered vital to both candidates' hopes this year. As he has in two earlier visits in recent weeks, Romney stuck to conservative parts of the state. At a high school in Grand Junction, out west, he held a town hall meeting where he went after the president on jobs and taxes. MITT ROMNEY: I know that last week, the middle class of America got a kick in the gut when the jobs numbers came out and we found out we'd created only 80,000 jobs. Our nation needs to create about double that if we're going to keep up with the population growth of our nation, and so we're falling further behind under this presidency, and that's one reason why we're going to change him, and get someone in there who can get this economy going. (APPLAUSE) GONYEA: This was Romney's first town hall meeting in more than two months. At events like this he is sometimes challenged by voters on the health care law he signed as governor in Massachusetts - Romneycare - or about his own wealth, and about money he keeps in overseas bank accounts. In Grand Junction, there were no such questions. Most set up topics and talking points Romney was eager to make. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: So, why does the Obama team and the liberal media want us to think that we should be more angry with what you do with your money than what Obama has done with mine? (APPLAUSE) GONYEA: That question drew loud and sustained applause before Romney answered. ROMNEY: I'm not going to apologize for success at home and I'm not going to apologize for America abroad. GONYEA: But despite such moments, long time Colorado pollster, Floyd Ciruli, says Romney is moving cautiously at this stage in the state, avoiding so far the Denver metropolitan area. FLOYD CIRULI: I assume this is a Maoist strategy - take the countryside and the cities will follow. GONYEA: Polls in Colorado have given the president a narrow but consistent lead over Romney, even when bad news on the economy or other topics has hit the administration. Ciruli says Romney will need to win over suburban voters around Denver. He says those are the people who decide statewide elections here. CIRULI: And so ultimately, that's where this battle will be and he hasn't gotten there yet. GONYEA: But first, Romney, who unexpectedly lost to Rick Santorum in the Colorado caucuses earlier this year, is working to shore up support among the GOP base. His second stop yesterday was Colorado Springs, more than an hour south of Denver. Forty-four-year-old Robbie Kaiser was letting his dog run in a park downtown. A tax lawyer, Kaiser says he's a party-line Republican voter. ROBBIE KAISER: I'm sort of a fiscal conservative, probably more of a social liberal - tend to vote more with my financial heart and mind, I guess. GONYEA: Are you a Romney guy? Have you been a Romney guy? KAISER: I'm not really excited about Romney, to be honest. I mean, I'll support him. GONYEA: But, Kaiser says, he does think Romney has a hard time relating to average Americans. Romney didn't hold a rally in Colorado Springs. He came to visit a food bank collecting provisions for people displaced by the massive wildfires that tore through the area. He met privately with some families then he joined workers in a warehouse sorting packages. ROMNEY: (unintelligible) GONYEA: It was a low-key visit. Afterward, he stood in the warehouse and spoke of the fires. ROMNEY: We've all watched what's happened here with horror, as we've seen the flames and the homes lost and the stories of loss of life. GONYEA: Less than a week earlier, the president also visited Colorado Springs to view fire damage and to meet with families. Yesterday, Romney praised those lending a hand locally before adding that there's something people all around the country can do to help out. ROMNEY: And what's happening is people are staying away because they think the whole area's been burned out. It's not. It's beautiful, as it's always been, and tourists need to come back. GONYEA: It was Romney mixing the skills he might need one day as the nation's consoler-in-chief with those of the local chamber of commerce president. He was a candidate and a businessman.

            "article_content": "President Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney are hitting the campaign trail hard this week. On Tuesday, the president was campaigning in Iowa \u2014 the state that helped to launch his White House bid in 2008. He told supporters in Iowa he wants a second term in order to finish what he started.  (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: This is MORNING EDITION from NPR News. I'm Renee Montagne. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: And I'm Steve Inskeep. Good morning. Now that the Independence Day holiday week is done, both presidential candidates have full schedules. Mitt Romney is in Houston, Texas today. He will address a convention of the NAACP. Yesterday, Romney was in Colorado, one of the most hotly contested swing states. President Obama stopped yesterday in the state that helped to launch his bid in 2008. And that's where NPR's Scott Horsley begins our coverage. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: It was his win in the Iowa caucuses four years ago that put Barack Obama on a path to the White House. And the first place he campaigned in Iowa was Cedar Rapids. Yesterday, the president was back there, telling supporters he wants a second term in order to finish what he started. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: We're going to have two choices in this election. And one choice is to take us down a path of top-down economics, and an approach that says if we do good for the folks at the very top, somehow everybody benefits. CROWD: No way. No. OBAMA: And my vision which says, you know, when we grow best, it's because our middle class is doing well. (SOUNDBITE OF YELLING FROM CROWD) OBAMA: And everybody who's fighting to get into the middle class. HORSLEY: The president is trying to illustrate that choice this week by focusing on taxes. The tax cuts that President George W. Bush championed a decade ago are due to expire at the end of this year. Mr. Obama wants Congress to extend most of those cuts for another year, saving the typical middle-class family about $2,000. At the same time, Mr. Obama would allow some of the cuts to expire; those on income above a quarter-million dollars a year. OBAMA: This has nothing to do with me wanting to punish success. We love folks getting rich. I hope Malia and Sasha, you know, go out there, you know, if that's what they want to do, that's great. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: (Unintelligible) OBAMA: But I do want to make sure that everybody else gets that chance as well. HORSLEY: Mr. Obama says the extra tax revenue from the wealthy - about $850 billion over a decade - could help to pay for more college grants and other programs that benefit the middle class. Polls show most Americans support higher taxes on the wealthy - that may be why Republicans are reluctant to separate the issue from popular middle class tax cuts. Frieda Howe of Central City, Iowa says the rich can afford to pay more. She insists that's not what Mitt Romney has called the politics of envy. FRIEDA HOWE: I'm not into class warfare. I think it's great that people make money. I just think they ought to be taxed a little more, that's all. HORSLEY: Duane Hughes agrees. He's retired after 38 years with the Cargill Company. Hughes also served as a Marine in Vietnam. DUANE HUGHES: I think we all got to share the load. You know, when you get one group of people, you know, that have more than others, and we need to share where we can and help them out. We do it when there's a disaster. Americans pull together when they need to pull together. HORSLEY: When Hughes talks about a natural disaster, he might be thinking of the floods that ravaged this area four years ago. So far this year, the problem is far too little rain. Still, Iowa as a whole is doing pretty well, with an unemployment rate of just 5.1 percent, well below the national average. Hughes knows things are tougher in other parts of the country, but he says people have to be patient. HUGHES: I think this is the greatest country in the world. And I think it'll keep being that. too, as long as we work together, you know, and try to solve the problems that we've got. It can't be just the president's burden. It's everybody's burden, you know, to try to make things better. HORSLEY: Iowa's relatively strong economy should be a plus for the president, and the Obama campaign has been actively organizing in this swing state for months now. Still, Mr. Obama told supporters in Cedar Rapids, he's not taking anything for granted. OBAMA: This is going to be a close election. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: Yeah. OBAMA: But I have so much... (SOUNDBITE OF YELLING AND CHEERING FROM CROWD) OBAMA: I have so much confidence whenever I come to Iowa. HORSLEY: After all, he says, this is the state that gave him a chance when no one else would.

            "article_content": "Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney's planned speech Wednesday at the NAACP convention in Houston comes at a precarious time for the nation's African-American community. -- The unemployment rate among blacks is north of 14 percent \u2014 more than 5 points higher than the national average. -- Opponents of GOP-led efforts to require voters in about a dozen states to show identification say the voter ID laws could disproportionately disenfranchise legal black and Latino voters. -- President Obama's recent endorsement of same-sex marriage and his decision to suspend deportations of young illegal immigrants have roiled some among his African-American base. A sign at the NAACP annual convention in Houston, where Mitt Romney is scheduled to speak on Wednesday.\n                \n                    \n                    Pat Sullivan/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption A sign at the NAACP annual convention in Houston, where Mitt Romney is scheduled to speak on Wednesday. That environment raises some intriguing opportunities for Romney, whose campaign mantra has been that Obama, who captured more than 95 percent of the black vote in 2008, has bungled the economic recovery. There has been no shortage of advice for what Romney should say when he addresses members of the nation's oldest civil rights organization, which is focused this week on issues ranging from the economy and education, to health and voting rights: Talk about your father's civil rights legacy, urged Democratic strategist Karen Finney in a column for The Hill; talk about unequal access to health care and quality education \u2014 and ask what Democrats have done for you lately \u2014 advised Miami Herald columnist Leonard Pitts Jr. But raising issues beyond his standard campaign trail economic message, and his recent embrace of education parity as the \"civil rights issue of our era,\" could be risky political business for Romney. \"This is an important appearance for him,\" says Rogers Smith, a University of Pennsylvania political science professor who has written extensively about race and politics. Though Romney may have little chance of capturing much of the black vote (Obama's 2008 opponent, Sen. John McCain, got 4 percent), he is going into what promises to be a close election, Smith says, and has to be careful not to tread into areas that could end up motivating a turnout for the incumbent president. \"He has to show that he is concerned,\" Smith says, \"and maybe some will stay home.\" Message Reach Romney senior adviser Tara Wall says the former Massachusetts governor is expected to emphasize educational disparity, which he framed as a civil rights issue during a May meeting with Hispanic leaders. \"This is a dialogue,\" says Wall, who was hired by the Romney campaign two months ago to assist in outreach to the black community. \"There is a commonality with his message and what many African-Americans support \u2014 school choice and charters, making sure kids have a fair shot at education.\" \"Gov. Romney also wants to draw distinctions between the way President Obama addresses the economy and the way he addresses it,\" Wall says. That's too \"vanilla\" for Raynard Jackson, a Washington-based Republican political consultant, who would like to see Romney use his NAACP appearance for more than just \"race insurance.\" \"Politically, I get it,\" says Jackson, an African-American who supported Obama in 2008,and now favors Romney. \"He wants to send a message beyond the black community to white, middle-class women and independent voters that Republicans aren't racist or hostile to the black community.\" But Jackson says he believes that Romney could squander an opportunity to speak directly to black voters that he may be able to peel off, particularly black business people, for fear of being perceived as pandering to African-Americans. He's not the only one who would like to see Romney take chances, but for different ends. Sociologist and political scientist Theda Skocpol at Harvard University says she'd like to see Romney go beyond a speech strategy of \"reassuring white, independent voters that he cares about African-Americans.\" Voter ID For Skocpol, a progressive whose research has included race, politics and the Tea Party, Romney's appearance before a group that has stood for civil rights and voting rights for more than 100 years provides a rare opportunity. \"I'd like to ask Gov. Romney to openly, explicitly and courageously condemn the ongoing campaign sponsored by partisans in his own party to make it difficult for African-Americans, Hispanics, poor people and young people to vote,\" Skocpol says. \"And to call for the Pennsylvania law, and others, to be reversed.\" The new Pennsylvania voter ID law requires that voters present a current government or university-issued identification that includes the voter's name and photo. An assessment by the state, which compared voter registration lists and state transportation records showed that more than 758,000 registered Pennsylvania voters, or 9.2 percent of all state voters, don't have the type of identification required by the new law. Earlier this month, Pennsylvania Republican House Majority Leader Mike Turzai said that the state's new voter ID law is \"gonna allow Gov. Romney to win the state of Pennsylvania.\" The law has been challenged in court by the American Civil Liberties Union. But in Pennsylvania, Romney supporter Renee Amoore, an African-American businesswoman, lifelong NAACP member, and deputy chairwoman of the state Republican Party, defended the law as necessary to thwart fraud. \"I work the polls, I see voter fraud,\" says Amoore, founder of a health care, economic development and management consulting group. \"People just need to get an ID \u2014 and we'll help you get it.\" Wall, the Romney adviser, says she has also seen voter fraud \"firsthand\" and that people should simply \"do what's necessary to be able to vote.\" While the NAACP is meeting in Texas, a Texas voter ID law is being challenged this week in a special federal court in Washington. Texas is one of the states that \u2014 because of a history of voter discrimination \u2014 must get approval from the U.S. Justice Department under the Voting Rights Act before enacting changes to its state election law. Attorney General Eric Holder, who has been moving to block some voter ID laws, including the one in Texas, spoke at the NAACP convention Tuesday. He likened new ballot box restrictions to post-Civil War poll taxes, and said that, in protecting voting rights, \"we will not allow political pretexts to disenfranchise American citizens of their most precious right.\" History Lesson When Romney spoke in June to decidedly cool national Hispanic leaders, he softened his tough primary-campaign tone on immigration, but offered little new in the way of policy proposals. He's expected to follow that template in Houston, where NAACP Chairwoman Roslyn Brock, in an interview on MSNBC, said members are \"eagerly waiting to hear his vision for America's future ... particularly for communities of color.\" President Obama addressed the convention three years ago on the group's 100th anniversary; Vice President Joe Biden will give a speech on Thursday.",

President Obama campaigned in Iowa on Tuesday, promoting his plan to extend the Bush-era tax cuts for those who make under $250,000 a year \u2014 but not for more wealthy Americans. Republican Mitt Romney was in another swing state, Colorado, hitting a new Republican charge that some of Obama's policies have helped create jobs overseas at the expense of the domestic job market. Obama attacked congressional Republicans, saying they threaten the extension of middle-class tax cuts. \"What's holding us back from making even more progress than we've made is a stalemate in Washington between two fundamentally different views about which path we should take as a country,\" Obama said. \"This election is about breaking that stalemate.\" Romney has called for an extension of all Bush-era tax cuts \u2014 including those for wealthy Americans. All of the cuts are set to expire at the end of the year. At a town hall meeting in Grand Junction, Colo., Romney said his energy policies would create U.S. jobs. He said Obama has stifled job creation by approving policies that make it harder to mine for coal and drill for oil. \"The more he pursues those policies, the harder it will be for America to go back to work,\" Romney said. Obama and the Democrats have recently criticized Romney's career at Bain Capital, and charged that many of the companies that Bain managed ended up sending jobs overseas. Romney turned the tables on Tuesday: \"If there's an outsourcer-in-chief, it's the president of the United States, not the guy who's running to replace him,\" he said. Romney said the Obama administration provided green energy companies with stimulus money they then used to build products in foreign countries, instead of the United States. The Republican National Committee unveiled a coordinated message on Tuesday in the form of a new website. At Kirkwood Community College in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, Obama said: \"Frankly, the choice could not be clearer. My opponent, his allies in Congress, they sincerely believe that prosperity comes from the top-down. They believe that if we spend trillions of dollars more on tax cuts mostly for the wealthy that it'll somehow create more jobs, even if we have to pay for it by gutting education.\" Both Iowa and Colorado are considered key swing states going into November's presidential election. Iowa has a relatively low unemployment rate at 5.1 percent, below the national average of 8.2 percent. Colorado's unemployment rate is 8.1 percent.",

The vast majority of American taxpayers would take a hit, including Randi Cartmill and Josh Walling, who live in Madison, Wis., with their three children. The family's household income hovers a little below the national median, in the $40,000 to $50,000 range. Cartmill says the tax cuts have helped the family's bottom line. \"I remember when they went into place and being pleasantly surprised by how much more money we got back,\" she says. In part, that's because the tax cuts doubled the tax credit for each child from $500 to $1,000. The cuts also created a new tax bracket for the lowest levels of income, which gives most families an $875 break. If these cuts were to expire, the Cartmill-Walling family's after-tax income would drop by about $2,500. \"That's a substantial amount of money,\" says Cartmill. \"Generally ... what we do with our tax refund is we use that as kind of our savings in the bank for [if] the car breaks down or the water heater goes or whatever and we have a big expense all at once.\" The way Walling sees it, that's like a 5 percent cut to their income on top of other blows they've taken as a result of the tough economy. \"I don't think my wife was explaining quite how hard it is, you know, but that's pretty much where it's at,\" Walling says. And they're not alone. The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center estimates 96 percent of taxpayers at the middle of the income distribution would see their taxes go up \"an average of about $1,800 a year,\" says Roberton Williams, a senior fellow at the center. \"That will reduce their after-tax income by about 4 percent,\" Williams says. \"Four percent if you're spending every dollar you've got makes a noticeable dent in your budget.\" To give a sense of the other side of the ledger, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation, extending just the higher child tax credit over the next decade would add almost $270 billion to the deficit.",

MELISSA BLOCK, HOST: This is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. From NPR News, I'm Melissa Block. President Obama is posing an election year challenge to Republicans over taxes. The president wants Congress to extend the Bush-era tax cuts for most Americans while allowing taxes for the wealthiest to go back up. That's a proposal he campaigned on four years ago and he'll be making the case again on the trail this week. NPR's Scott Horsley reports. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: For several weeks now, President Obama has been arguing that part of what's holding America back economically is a political stalemate in Washington. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: And nowhere is that stalemate more pronounced than on the issue of taxes. HORSLEY: Today, the president tried to move that issue front and center by addressing the Bush-era tax cuts, which are set to expire at the end of this year. Mr. Obama wants to let the tax cuts lapse on schedule for the wealthiest Americans, those making more than a quarter million dollars. But he told a gathering of middle-class families in the White House East Room, their taxes should stay where they are. OBAMA: Let's not hold the vast majority of Americans and our entire economy hostage while we debate the merits of another tax cut for the wealthy. HORSLEY: In effect, the president is trying to decouple middle class tax rates from taxes on the wealthiest 2 percent. His Republican rival, Mitt Romney, on the other hand, has called for making all of the Bush-era tax cuts permanent as well as additional cuts that would primarily benefit the rich. OBAMA: In many ways, the fate of the tax cut for the wealthiest Americans will be decided by the outcome of the next election. My opponent will fight to keep them in place. I will fight to end them. But that argument shouldn't threaten you. HORSLEY: If this all sounds familiar it's because we went through this very same debate two years ago. In 2010, Republicans in Congress insisted on preserving the tax cuts for all income levels, and Mr. Obama eventually backed down. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell suggested on CNN he'll be making the same arguments again. SENATOR MITCH MCCONNELL: I negotiated with Vice President Biden the two-year extension of the current tax rates that are - that we're in right now. The president signed it because he argued that to let taxes go up would make the economy worse. We have a slower growth rate today than we had then. HORSLEY: A spokeswoman for Mitt Romney added the president's proposal would raise taxes on job creators, although the White House counters 97 percent of all small businesses would be untouched by the higher rates. Mr. Obama argues the slow growth and middle class stagnation of the last decade disproves the trickle-down theory used to justify tax cuts for the rich. He insists most people did better in the 1990s, when the wealthy were paying taxes at a higher rate. OBAMA: I just believe that anybody making over $250,000 a year should go back to the income tax rates we were paying under Bill Clinton, back when our economy created nearly 23 million new jobs, the biggest budget surplus in history and plenty of millionaires to boot. HORSLEY: A Gallup poll this spring found more than six in 10 Americans support higher taxes on the wealthy, and Mr. Obama hopes to tap into that sentiment when he campaigns this week in the battleground states of Iowa and Virginia. The president's tax plan is likely to be more useful as a political prop than an actual budget blueprint, at least until after November. Roberton Williams of the Tax Policy Center says that's when Congress will have to act, or else every taxpayer will face a bigger bill from the IRS. ROBERTON WILLIAMS: No one wants to see all the tax cuts expire because everyone realizes the negative impact that would have on the economy. That said, people are not going to come together and say, I'm willing to give on this and give on that. It's a lot easier to kick the can down the road for another year and say, let's try again after the dust has settled in the 2012 election. HORSLEY: The president's plan would offer a temporary escape route from the so-called fiscal cliff, but the same taxing questions would resurface next year. Scott Horsley, NPR News, the White House.

            "article_content": "They're called the Bush tax cuts for a reason. And when they were passed in the early 2000s, most Democrats opposed them. Cut to a decade later: President Obama is calling for a second extension in as many years of the \"temporary\" cuts, but it won't come without a fight from congressional Republicans. Given the apparent role reversal, who owns the George W. Bush-era tax cuts now: Democrats or Republicans? \"They're still called the Bush tax cuts, but I think it's a bit of a misnomer at this point,\" says Ted Gayer, the co-director of economic studies at the centrist Brookings Institution. Michael Ettlinger, vice president for economics at the left-wing Center for American Progress, says it's really a matter of semantics. \"It's just easier to call them the Bush tax cuts,\" he says. The latest fight between the president and Republicans is shaping up to be a battle royal \u2014 not only are taxes involved but so are deficits and class politics. That's because the president wants to extend the cuts for one year, but only to those making less than $250,000. NPR's independent analysis shows Obama's proposal would add $3.2 trillion to the national deficit over the next decade, as opposed to $3.9 trillion if the tax cuts were extended to everyone, like Republicans want. The Bush tax cuts sliced about 2 percent off most tax brackets. According to the Tax Policy Center, 83 percent of Americans will see their taxes rise if the cuts are allowed to expire. Those making between $50,000 and $75,000 would pay about $2,200 more, while those making $1 million or more would owe an extra $175,000. Both sides have to make their case to middle-class Americans. For Obama, it goes like this: The wealthiest Americans need to pay their fair share and take some of the burden off the struggling middle class. For Republicans, it goes like this: A tax increase on the wealthy, who are the economy's \"job creators,\" will have a negative trickle-down effect on the middle class in the way of more lost jobs. Sound familiar? The same lines were drawn two years ago, but the president blinked and the Bush tax cuts were renewed for all taxpayers. If the issue comes to a head again before Election Day, don't count on Obama backing down again. \"There will be a political fight this fall on the dueling positions on tax cuts and no resolution before the election,\" says Brian Darling, a senior fellow for government studies at the conservative Heritage Foundation. \"If Obama wins, there will be a short-term deal in the lame duck [session],\" he says. \"If Romney wins, there will be an effort to extend all the tax cuts on a permanent basis.\"",

Setting the stage for more election-year debate over taxes and economic policy, President Obama this morning challenged Republicans to support a plan to extend for one year \u2014 but only for families earning less than $250,000 annually \u2014 the so-called Bush tax cuts. Republicans want the tax cuts, which expire at the end of 2012, to continue for everyone. Obama says it's time for wealthier taxpayers to pay more because that will help narrow future budget deficits. To Republicans, Obama said: \"Let's agree to what we agree on\" \u2014 that middle class taxes shouldn't go up. Even as he was speaking, Republican leaders in Congress were expressing their opposition. Our original post (from 8:45 a.m. ET) and earlier updates: It's long been President Obama's position that the so-called Bush tax cuts that expire at the end of this year should only be extended for families with incomes of less than $250,000 a year. And it's long been the position of House Speaker John Boehner and other leading Republicans that none of the Bush-era cuts should be allowed to expire \u2014 they should be extended for everyone, regardless of income. Obama makes the case that the wealthy can afford to pay more and that asking them to do that will help narrow federal budget deficits. Boehner and his fellow Republicans make the case that with the economy still seeming to stutter and job growth remaining weak, now's not the time to ask more of any taxpayers. Today around noon ET, the White House says, the president will deliver \"a statement on the need for Congress to act to extend tax cuts for middle class families.\" According to The New York Times, what Obama will propose is \"a one-year extension of the Bush-era tax cuts for people making less than $250,000.\" As Politico writes: \"The measure is the latest in a recent spate of moves by Obama that are a different form of political baseball than he played for much of his term. Instead of going for grand slams, he's been going for a series of singles - the immigration executive action, for instance, was one of them. It's a move related to the middle class, which also seeks to box in his rival.\" We'll update this post as the story develops, so hit your \"refresh\" button to see our latest additions. Update at 12:16 p.m. ET. It's \"Not About Taxing Job Creators, It's About Helping Job Creators\": According to the president, \"the proposal I make today would extend these tax cuts for 97 percent of small business owners.\" And to Republicans, he says: \"let's agree to what we agree on\" \u2014 that middle class taxes shouldn't go up. As he's been speaking, the staff of Republicans such as House Speaker John Boehner have been emailing reporters. Boehner calls the president's plan \"raising taxes on small businesses.\" Update at 12:15 p.m. ET. Confirmation: He is urging Congress, the president says, to \"extend the tax cuts for the 98 percent of Americans who make less than $250,000 for another year.\" Update at 12:14 p.m. ET. Time To Let Tax Cuts For Wealthy Expire, Obama Says: \"I'm not proposing anything radical here,\" the president says, adding that he believes \"anybody earning more than $250,000 a year\" should see their tax rates go back to where they were during the Clinton administration \u2014 that is, before the Bush tax cuts. Update at 12:10 p.m. ET. Republicans Believe \"Prosperity Comes From The Top Down,\" Obama Says: As he begins his remarks, Obama says that Republicans and Democrats have \"two very different views about which direction we should go in as a country.\" He says Republicans believe \"prosperity comes from the top down.\" He disagrees, Obama adds. Update at 11:47 a.m. ET. President's Statement Coming Shortly: The White House has turned on its live webcast, which means the president should be at the microphone soon. Update at 11:45 a.m. ET. Romney Campaign Says Obama Favors \"A Massive Tax Increase.\" Andrea Saul, a spokeswoman for the Romney campaign, has sent reporters a statement that says, in part: \"President Obama's response to even more bad economic news is a massive tax increase. It just proves again that the president doesn't have a clue how to get America working again and help the middle class. The president's latest bad idea is to raise taxes on families, job creators, and small businesses. ... Unlike President Obama, Gov. Romney understands that the last thing we need to do in this economy is raise taxes on anyone. ...\"",

            "article_content": "President Obama's campaign bus rolls from Ohio into Pennsylvania Friday. He is trying to make the case that the U.S. economy is slowly but surely on the mend. While touring Ohio's manufacturing belt Thursday, he highlighted the rebound of the auto industry.  LINDA WERTHEIMER, HOST: It's MORNING EDITION, from NPR News. I'm Linda Wertheimer, with Steve Inskeep. President Obama is in Ohio and Pennsylvania today, dealing with some unwelcome news. The jobs report for June out today has unemployment stuck at 8.2 percent. Here's a sharp reaction from the president's Republican challenger, Mitt Romney. MITT ROMNEY: There's a lot of misery in America today, and these number understate what people are feeling. WERTHEIMER: Mr. Obama is highlighting the rebound of the auto industry. NPR's Scott Horsley reports. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: The Obama campaign calls this the Betting on America bus tour. But there's no guaranteed political jackpot. Even staunch supporters of the president say it's a tough hand he's had to play. DEBBIE DALTON: I think he's doing the best job he can for us, considering all he has to fight against. HORSLEY: Debbie Dalton, who attended an Obama rally in Maumee, Ohio yesterday, offers an equally qualified appraisal of her state's economy. Unemployment in Ohio is below the national average. But at 7.3 percent, it's still far too high. DALTON: It's not nearly as bad as it was. It can get a whole lot better, though. I'm very glad, though, that he has saved the auto industry, especially since my husband is retired from there, because we probably would have lost our house otherwise. HORSLEY: The turnaround in the auto industry is one of the genuine bright spots in the economy. The industry's added more than 230,000 workers since General Motors and Chrysler emerged from bankruptcy. This week, the two automakers reported double-digit sales growth for the month of June. That's good news for Shawn Rhodes, who works at a GM foundry in Defiance, Ohio. SHAWN RHODES: It's really helped a lot out. The place I work at, we were laying off. Now we're actually hiring. We've probably hired 200 people in the last three months. People are out buying again, feeling more comfortable with the economy. So everything's good so far, knock on wood. HORSLEY: Mr. Obama was quick to remind voters here that while he went out on a limb to support the auto industry, his Republican challenger Mitt Romney argued the government should stay out of it. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) (SOUNDBITE OF SONG \"YOUR LOVE IS LIFTING ME HIGHER\") HORSLEY: As his customized bus rolled from west to east along Lake Erie, Mr. Obama stopped here and there for a cheeseburger, or some peaches, or a beer at Ziggy's Pub. There were no arena-sized rallies on this day, but smaller, folksier gatherings around park pavilions and flag-draped gazebos. The president spoke in unusually personal terms about the opportunities he and his family have enjoyed and the challenge of preserving those opportunities for today's middle class. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) HORSLEY: Republican critics argue Mr. Obama's had enough time to fix the economy. Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal and other GOP surrogates shadowed the president throughout Ohio, holding their own campaign events in many of the same places he did. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) HORSLEY: Mr. Obama countered that Romney's plan for tax cuts and reduced regulation is the same economic blueprint followed by George W. Bush. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) HORSLEY: Mr. Obama calls the November election a choice between two very different economic visions, telling voters they get to be the tie-breaker, and nowhere is breaking that tie more important than here in Ohio.

            "article_content": "There apparently isn't a unified Republican message on whether President Obama has introduced a big new tax through the Affordable Care Act. Eric Fehrnstrom, a top aide to Mitt Romney, said Monday that the Republican presidential candidate's position is that the penalty under the new law \u2014 the one for people who can afford to buy health insurance, but don't \u2014 is not a tax. The Supreme Court last week upheld the health care law's individual mandate on the grounds that it is a permissible tax, in a 5-4 opinion authored by Chief Justice John Roberts. Visit msnbc.com for breaking news, world news, and news about the economy Asked by NBC News' Chuck Todd how Romney and his advisers described the money individuals had to pay for failing to buy insurance under the Massachusetts health care law Romney signed as governor, Fehrnstrom said it also was a \"penalty\" \u2014 not a tax \u2014 and that Romney had always classified it as such. Romney's response immediately after Thursday's ruling was in line with the dissent embraced by four of the high court's conservatives, Fehrnstrom said: \"The governor disagreed with the ruling of the court. He agreed with the dissent that was written by Justice Scalia, which very clearly stated that the mandate was not a tax.\" Thus, Romney and Obama appear to share the same view, at least on calling the enforcement provision of the individual mandate a penalty, not a tax. Democrats have defended Obama against conservative attacks that his signature health care law will raise taxes on the middle class when the individual mandate takes effect in 2014 by saying, one, it's not a tax; and two, if it is, then Romney imposed a similar tax as Massachusetts governor. And who better for Romney to cite for support than Justice Antonin Scalia, a conservative icon? By saying he doesn't accept Roberts' ruling that the individual mandate enforcement mechanism is a tax (and therefore constitutional), Romney not only ties himself to Scalia \u2014 he distances himself from Roberts. And the chief justice has become increasingly unpopular in some conservative circles since Thursday's ruling. Still, Romney's word choice throws an obstacle in front of conservatives who have indicated they intend to criticize Obama, from now until Election Day, for imposing a new tax. And when congressional Republicans and other conservatives charge that the individual mandate contains a new tax, their claims could be dampened somewhat when the man atop November's Republican ballot says it doesn't. Democrats, as you'd expect, wasted little time pointing out Fehrnstrom's comments. But conservatives are highlighting evidence of discomfiture among Democrats over Roberts' individual-mandate-equals-tax equation. The Hot Air blog pointed out, as others have, an appearance by Rep. Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader from California, on NBC's Meet The Press on Sunday. At one point, Pelosi seemed about to refer to the \"penalty\" as a \"tax\" \u2014 but pulled back from it in mid-thought.",

In 2009, as President Obama was trying to convince Congress to pass his health care legislation, he stridently refused to characterize as a \"tax\" the penalty that would be imposed for not obtaining insurance under the law's individual mandate. On Thursday, Chief Justice John Roberts begged to differ \u2014 while using the tax classification to save Obama's signature domestic accomplishment by a single Supreme Court vote. And Republicans pounced. A Thursday night email from the Republican National Committee offers a \"brief history\" of what it calls the president's \"broken promises on health care taxes\" dating to the 2008 campaign \u2014 a time when Obama still opposed the whole idea of the individual mandate. And it includes a 2009 appearance on ABC's This Week, when Obama responded to the claim that the mandate would be a tax increase by saying flatly: \"That's not true.\" The Los Angeles Times reports that on Friday, the conservative group Americans for Prosperity launched a $9 million ad campaign that now calls the health care law \"one of the largest tax increases in American history.\" Surrogates for the Obama campaign, in a conference call with reporters on Friday, fought back. \"I just want to respond to the latest, frankly, bizarre attack, which is the claim that this act represents a big tax increase on the middle class,\" Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick said. \"First, this is a penalty. It's about dealing with the freeloaders, the folks who now get their care without insurance in high-cost emergency room settings. And all the rest of us pay for it today. The estimates are that by bringing those folks into the insurance system and penalizing those who don't come in, we're talking about a penalty on 1, maybe 2 percent of Americans.\" Patrick also gave a backhanded political compliment to his predecessor, Mitt Romney, architect of the Massachusetts' health care law: \"In using a model \u2014 the model \u2014 for Obamacare, we've reached 99.8 percent of children, 98 percent of our overall population. I don't think there's another state in America that can touch that. We are healthier by any number of measures. The cost of health care has come down on a per capita basis. There are more businesses offering health insurance to their employees today than before health insurance reform went into effect. Folks have all the choices they used to have and more, and we're bringing health care costs down. It has not busted our budget either. Expansion added about 1 percent to state spending. That's Romneycare in Massachusetts, and that will be Obamacare for the rest of the country.\" Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, in the same call, said Romney and some of his backers are \"retreating to the last bastion of scoundrels, which is to try to cast this as some sort of tax increase.\"",

Even in Washington, a city where hyperbole rules, it still seems difficult to overstate how big a win the Supreme Court's decision on President Obama's signature piece of domestic legislation is for the man in the Oval Office. The Affordable Care Act is so identified with him, after all, that its opponents quickly dubbed it \"Obamacare,\" a term supporters at first eschewed but later came to embrace. Though it was only the narrowest of victories, a 5-4 decision with Chief Justice John Roberts writing for the majority, a win is a win. And it was a victory the president needed badly though it could boomerang if Roberts' interpretation of the individual mandate as a tax becomes a liability for Obama. With the economy still weak and likely to deliver some downside surprises in terms of jobless numbers between now and November, the president is clearly vulnerable on that primary domestic issue. Read more about the Supreme Court decision's effects: A loss for Obama would have strengthened the arguments of challenger Mitt Romney and other Republicans that the president had foolishly squandered much of his early presidency on what turned out to be an unconstitutional expansion of federal power over the lives of Americans and the states. The court's decision Thursday, for all practical purposes, ends that argument, however, since whatever a majority of the court decides is constitutional is so by definition. While he had plenty to be happy about, Obama kept his remarks following the decision measured and matter of fact. Speaking from the White House East Room, he said: \"... Today, I'm as confident as ever that when we look back five years from now, or 10 years from now, or 20 years from now, we'll be better off because we had the courage to pass this law and keep moving forward.\" The decision instead allows the president to argue even more full-throatedly than he already has been doing on the campaign trail that enacting the health care law was the \"right thing to do.\" After the legislation passed in 2010 and it became clearer that it was unpopular with many Americans across the political spectrum, Obama and other White House officials were reticent to the point of silence talk about the law as an accomplishment. In recent months, the president has included the law in his stump speeches in the litany of achievements from his time in office. The Supreme Court's decision will let him pump up the volume even more. Meanwhile, the decision could boost the spirits of Obama's most loyal supporters, many of whom until the past year would say they didn't feel like the president had given them much to cheer about.  The decision, however, is also already energizing the president's opponents. House leaders have scheduled another vote to repeal the law, symbolic since a repeal has no chance of being passed. Romney's campaign reported more than $100,000 in donations coming in right after the court's announcement. In his reaction to the high court decision, Romney said: \"What the Court did not do on its last day in session, I will do on my first day if elected President of the United States. And that is I will act to repeal Obamacare. \"Let's make clear that we understand what the Court did and did not do. What the Court did today was say that Obamacare does not violate the Constitution. What they did not do was say that Obamacare is good law or that it's good policy. \"Obamacare was bad policy yesterday. It's bad policy today. Obamacare was bad law yesterday. It's bad law today.\" What's more, because Roberts found the law's individual mandate constitutional under the federal government's taxing power (the penalty for not having insurance should be read as a tax, he said) Republicans are counting on Obama being vulnerable to new charges that he's raising taxes on the middle class. That could be a powerful weapon, especially since the president vowed not to raise taxes on Americans making less than $250,000 a year. One of the most important aspects of the court's decision, for Obama at least, is that it ensures that a key piece of Obama's legacy survives, at least until there comes a time \u2014 if it ever occurs \u2014 when a different president and different Congress have the votes to repeal it.",

            "article_content": "The European debt crisis provided the backdrop to the weekend's election in Greece where a conservative, party won the most votes. The New Democracy party is working to form a coalition government and says Greece must meet its bailout commitments. But party leader Antonis Samaras also said he would work to alleviate the hardships Greeks have suffered under austerity measures.  ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Robert Siegel in Washington, D.C. MELISSA BLOCK, HOST: And I'm Melissa Block hosting this week from NPR West in Culver City, California. We begin this hour with the aftermath of yesterday's Greek elections. Politicians are hurrying to form a new government. The New Democracy Party won the biggest share of votes and its leader is pledging that Greece will honor the tough terms of the bailout it accepted from its European partners. But as NPR's Sylvia Poggioli reports, keeping that promise will not be easy. SYLVIA POGGIOLI, BYLINE: New Democracy leader, Antonis Samaras, had consultation today with the leaders of the other parties and promised a new government will be in place very shortly. He reiterated his call for a government of national salvation with as many parties as possible. But Alexis Tsipras, the leader of Syriza, the leftist party that came in a close second, made clear he intends to remain in opposition. The likely coalition partners are the Socialist Party, which has alternated in power with New Democracy for the last four decades and the small democratic left party. Nick Malkoutzis, deputy editor of Kathimerini's English language daily, says Greece is in dire need of a broad-based government. He points out that New Democracy and the Socialists are the architects of an entrenched patronage system that many single out as a major cause of the country's economic crisis. NICK MALKOUTZIS: They had become accustomed to a system which no longer works, a system based around the public sector system, based around the exchange of favors with the private sector, with voters and that doesn't exist anymore. It can't exist anymore. And they've been caught short. POGGIOLI: The next government faces daunting tasks. According to the bailout deal, it must announce by the end of this month another 11 billion euros in budget cuts and must fire 150,000 public servants over the next three years. This comes as Greece is in its fifth year of a recession. Unemployment is at a record high. Consumption has plummeted. Tens of thousands of businesses have shut down and tax revenues and other sources of income are drying up. Hospitals are running out of basic goods like surgical gloves and gauze. Pharmacies are not stocking cancer and diabetes medicines and the power company is seeking funds to pay its Russian gas supplier in order to keep producing energy. In a statement today, the likely new Prime Minister Samaras said: We're looking for new policies that would let us breathe, a clear appeal to Greece's EU partners, Germany in particular, to cut Greece some slack. Commentator George Malouchos says Greek politician don't have the clout to renegotiate the bailout conditions. GEORGE MALOUCHOS: They are not able to make Germans to change their mind. Germany will not help Greece. They will not change the plans. They will not give the space to the Greek government to do some things. POGGIOLI: With Greece's large middle class fraying at the edges, editor Markoutzis says social tensions are rippling through the society. MALKOUTZIS: So it's becoming very fractious, and there isn't really anything there to hold it together because the economic situation is deteriorating all the time. So people can't get a foothold in this crisis. They're just slipping down the ladder all the time. POGGIOLI: Alexandros Karamalikis, a former record producer now unemployed, is worried about the rise of an ultra right-wing party, Golden Dawn. Its voting base includes many unemployed and many policemen, and its members have gone on rampages against immigrants. ALEXANDROS KARAMALIKIS: I see more violence. I see that the Golden Dawn believes that there's no justice for them so they can do whatever they want. And that's, you know, that makes me afraid. POGGIOLI: With 7 percent of the vote, Golden Dawn will have 18 deputies in parliament. Sylvia Poggioli, NPR News, Athens. Copyright \u00a9 2012 NPR.  All rights reserved.

One region where the vote is expected to be particularly tight is in Egypt's Nile Delta, north of Cairo.  (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: And we have one more election to talk about this morning, this one in Egypt. It's the second and last day of the presidential run-off there. Egyptians are choosing between the Muslim Brotherhood's candidate, Mohammed Morsi, and retired Air Force General Ahmed Shafiq, who was the last prime minister under ousted President Hosni Mubarak. One region where the vote is expected to be particularly tight is in Egypt's Nile Delta, north of Cairo. That's where Kimberly Adams traveled and she filed this report. KIMBERLY ADAMS, BYLINE: The Egyptian governorate of El Sharkia is blanketed with the lush farmland for which the Nile Delta is famous. It's also the birthplace of both candidates in the presidential run-off. Khalil Ahmed works in fields of corn, rice, and clover just outside the district's capital city, and laments the difficulties of low-income farmers like him. Farming families make up about half of Egypt's population. KHALIL AHMED: (Through Translator) This land, we're renting it at black market prices. We had lands and the accursed Mubarak, God send him to Hell, he allowed the landlords to take our land away from us. ADAMS: But despite his anger with the former regime, Ahmed says he's voting for Mubarak's last prime minister, Ahmed Shafiq, because he doesn't trust the Brotherhood candidate. Nearby in a clover field his wife, Sohair Abdel Azizz, says she doesn't trust the Brotherhood either. SOHAIR ABDEL AZIZZ: (Through Translator) Because if the Brotherhood gets control, it'll be like we were sold. But if Shafiq wins and we don't like him, we'll be able to get him out the next time we vote. ADAMS: Shadi Hamid is the director of research at the Brookings Doha Center. He says despite the religiosity of Egypt's countryside, many rural voters are shunning the Brotherhood's Morsi for the security and economic improvements promised by Shafiq. SHADI HAMID: So even if voters has Islamist inclinations, at the end of the day, they're watching the economy. (SOUNDBITE OF TRAFFIC) ADAMS: On the streets of the regional capital, Zagazig, Shafiq campaign posters give way to Morsi banners. It's Morsi's hometown, and it was an embarrassment to the campaign when he lost here to Shafiq in the first round of voting - although Morsi won the most votes nationwide. Dr. Nagi Sakr, a surgeon who works on Morsi's local election committee, acknowledges his candidate is unlikely to get much of the rural vote. But he is counting on a high turnout among middle-class urban supporters to push Morsi over the top. DR. NAGI SAKR: Ninety percent of professionals here will give his voice to Dr. Morsi. But the others will support Shafiq. ADAMS: But on the farm outside Zagazig, the revolution feels far away to Sohair Abdel Azizz. All she's worried about are the low prices for her crops and the lack of security. AZIZZ: (Through Translator) It's been a year now in God's torment. We don't sleep at night. We fear for our children and we fear for their future. ADAMS: She says she just wants things to be peaceful, and she's hoping her vote this weekend will help accomplish that.

Sunday's parliamentary election will go a long way toward determining whether Greece stays in the EU.\n                \n                    \n                    Petros Giannakouris/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Torn Greek (left) and European Union flags fly at the entrance of an abandoned factory in the industrial zone of Komotini about 500 miles from Athens. Sunday's parliamentary election will go a long way toward determining whether Greece stays in the EU. Greeks are headed back to the polls Sunday after last month's inconclusive parliamentary election left the country without a governing coalition. And like the last time, people are polarized over harsh austerity measures imposed on Greece as part of a large European economic bailout. The split is between those who support the conservative New Democracy party, which backs the bailout deal, and those who favor the leftist Syriza party, which has vowed to scrap it. Both parties are running neck and neck, despite vocal warnings from many EU leaders that a bailout rejection will lead to a deeper crisis and Greece's exit from the eurozone. \"Fear is the ruling factor in these elections,\" political consultant Vassilios Dascalopoulos says. \"Fear of uncertainty, insecurity \u2013 it's the most constant parameter.\" New Democracy has been running a TV ad raising the specter of a Greek eurozone exit. In it, a teacher reads from a list of eurozone members: Cyprus, Belgium, Ireland, Portugal, Spain. A little girl asks, \"And Greece, sir? Why not Greece?\" Then, a deep baritone weighs in: \"We don't play with our kids' future.\" Maria Kousiaki, 21, echoes the party's warnings. \"I fear economic problems with bank, with politics, anarchy and maybe fascism,\" she says outside a New Democracy kiosk as party leader Antonis Samaras greets supporters. \"We're trying to get rid of this very negative climate that jeopardizes our future because there area no investments,\" Samaras says, \"because tourism is going down, unfortunately, due to this very negative environment.\" Despite fears of Greece's banishment from the eurozone should Syriza win, the party has won over a large portion of the depleted middle class in this austerity-weary country. Its slogan is simple but optimistic: \"We leave the bailout behind and open the path to hope.\" On one sweltering afternoon, people gathered for a Syriza town hall-style meeting in Thrakomakedones, a residential area and longtime New Democracy stronghold. The residents want to know what a Syriza government would do for them \u2014 retirees who have seen their pensions slashed, businessmen gone bankrupt, young people with no job prospects. A psychotherapist named Terapia Masaraki says many Greeks will switch to Syriza because it promises to restore what they lost. \"Many people are not so depressed. They have hope because they want to change. No longer passive. No, it's over in Greece. Over. We want to change.\" A few months ago, Syriza was a marginal, far-left party. But it saw a swell of support in the May elections. It finished second to New Democracy, which like the other long-governing Socialist party, suffered huge losses due to its support for tough German-dictated austerity measures known as the memorandum. With Greece's 40-year-old political establishment imploding, Syriza has projected a solid image, says Dascalopoulos, the political consultant. \"They have been persistent to their message of anti-memorandum agenda, and they have been able to create an umbrella for all protest in Greece from far right to far left,\" he says. But reviving the country's economy is a daunting task: five years of recession, salaries slashed up to 50 percent, unemployment at record highs, health care cut to the bone. George Stathakis, a Syriza member of Parliament and economist, outlines his party's plan to reverse the downward spiral. \"There will be a major redistribution of income from the wealthy to the poorer strata of society, protect the welfare state and try to improve its performance. We will freeze wages and salaries at the current level.\" Given the fissures in Greek society as the country sinks deeper into the debt crisis, no single party is expected to win an outright majority in Sunday's election.",

Ohio could very well be the state where what's expected to be a very close presidential race gets decided. And every indication is that the economy will be the issue that drives the majority of voters to either President Obama or Mitt Romney. Which explains why on Thursday both the Democratic president and the all-but-official Republican nominee were, again, in Ohio to argue why he and not his opponent should be president starting January 20, 2013. Each rehearsed his economic arguments in campaign appearances in his respective Buckeye State stronghold. Obama was in heavily Democratic Cleveland on the state's northern edge. Romney was in the Republican bastion of Cincinnati along the state's southern rim bordering Kentucky. Their appearances in their Ohio electoral sweet spots had symbolic significance: Success or failure for each depends on whose campaign is best at turning out the most voters in the reddest and bluest parts of the state. The specific venues for their speeches also held additional meaning. Obama spoke at Cuyahoga Community College, a reminder of his pledge to \"invest\" in domestic priorities, including higher education, and a reflection of his strength with younger voters. Romney spoke at a small business, a maker of manufacturing equipment. It was a site chosen to underscore his message that he is the better candidate for American business and thus the economy. As for the speeches themselves, both men mainly repeated themes voters have heard many times before. Obama again reminded voters how the economy had been in free fall when he became president, how his policies helped stabilize it and by some measures brought real progress, and then he provided his vision of a better economic future for middle-class Americans. Also, because Obama's best hope for re-election is to frame the contest as a choice between two radically different views of the future depending on who wins, the president hammered repeatedly at his argument against the GOP challenger. He said a Romney presidency \u2014 with more tax cuts for the wealthy and presidential hostility to spending on middle class priorities \u2014 would be a third term for George W. Bush, or even worse, though he never mentioned his predecessor by name. Romney, for his part, continued to make his case that Obama had failed to turn around the economy in his 3 1/2 years in office and had even made it worse. Obama broke his promises, Romney said. And he reminded voters that Obama himself said early in his presidency that his administration would be a \"one-term proposition\" if the economy didn't significantly improve. It was all a part of Romney's effort to make sure voters go to the polls in November seeing their vote as a referendum on Obama, instead of a choice between the candidates. Not that Romney didn't have his own economic vision. He offered what he said were \"three big ideas\" for increasing the lift under the U.S. economy \u2014 more domestic energy production, repealing \"Obamacare\" and attacking federal deficits. In an appeal to middle-class voters, Romney said he didn't care about \"job creators,\" meaning the most financially successful Americans, for their own sake; rather he cared about them because of the need for jobs. Thursday's speeches were watched closely by observers of American politics for the any nuances that could indicate a new theme or direction. It's important to remember, however, that these are still early days in the presidential race. It's only June and most voters really aren't paying attention to the daily messaging of the campaigns and won't be until the fall, if ever. Still, for some interested observers like Jason Fichtner, an expert in Social Security and federal tax and budget policy, the dueling speeches underscored a continuing frustration with the realities of the campaign trail. \"The problem I'm having with campaign speeches in general, is they are long on rhetoric and short on substance,\" said Fichtner, senior research fellow at George Mason University's Libertarian-leaning Mercatus Center where Charles Koch, a founder, serves on the board. \"Voters, and me, as a policy analyst, want them to say, 'Here is a plan,' and not blame someone else for our problems.' \" \"Is the economy in better shape than four years ago? Yes,\" says Fichtner, who served as a top official in the Social Security Administration during the Bush administration and into Obama's term, \"but could it be better?\" He characterized the differences between the visions put forth by Obama and Romney like this: Obama's view is that the private sector should alleviate the burdens of the public sector, and vice versa for Romney. Bruce Bartlett, a columnist and blogger on fiscal issues who once worked for congressional Republicans, and in the Reagan and first Bush administrations, but who is now an independent who voted for Obama, said it's up to the president to effectively point out the flaws in Romney's campaign statements, something the president took pains to do Thursday in a 53-minute speech. \"Every single person who runs for president implies there are going to be radical changes the day they're elected,\" he said. \"It seems to me that Romney has gone beyond the norm in this area... And it's up to Obama to draw him out. 'Tell me specifically what taxes are you going to raise? What programs are you going to cut? That's his job. And the job of his campaign.\"",

They are running Tuesday in a special election to replace retired Rep. Gabrielle Giffords. Voters in southeastern Arizona go to the polls Tuesday in a special election to fill the rest of the congressional term of former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords. Giffords, a Democrat, resigned in January, a year after she was critically wounded in a shooting rampage. Running to fill the remaining six months of her term are her former aide, Ron Barber, and Republican Jesse Kelly, a businessman and Iraq War veteran. The special election has echoes of the 2010 congressional campaign in the Tucson-based 8th Congressional District. Kelly is once again the Republican candidate; he lost by about 4,000 votes to Giffords in 2010. He's running against Barber \u2014 who was Giffords' top aide in Arizona. But of course, nothing is the same in the district since the 2011 shooting, in which Giffords and Barber both were hurt and six people were killed. Barber and Kelly have tangled over a number of issues, in what by all accounts will be a tight race in a year when both parties are scrambling for every seat in Congress. Barber tells NPR, \"I've been hearing over and over again from middle-class Arizonans that they're really feeling squeezed and that no one really cares about their concerns.\" Kelly, who in the 2010 race called Social Security a ponzi scheme, has backed away from that comment. He declined to be interviewed by NPR, but last week on MSNBC, he said beneficiaries of Social Security and Medicare should be given choices between government and private programs. Former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords appears on May 24 at the Intrepid Sea, Air and Space Museum in New York City.\n                \n                    \n                    Mike Coppola/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords appears on May 24 at the Intrepid Sea, Air and Space Museum in New York City. \"Right now, Medicare recipients are getting less quality care than they ever have because the access to doctors is decreasing. That's because the government simply won't pay its bills,\" Kelly said. \"Doctors are trying to get paid for the Medicare patients and they're not getting paid by the government.\" Kelly says he would support the repeal of President Obama's health care bill, the Affordable Care Act. Barber says parts of the program should be kept and others made to work better. In the aftermath of last year's shooting, Kelly has toned down his 2010 \"Send A Warrior To Congress\" campaign theme, although a PAC supporting Kelly this time around sent out a fundraising email using a photo of the ex-Marine in camouflage holding an assault rifle. Kelly's own ads have presented a kinder, gentler image of him as a family man. The National Republican Congressional Committee has run ads on Kelly's behalf, implying Barber would be a pawn for Obama. Barber has tried to keep Kelly from tying him to the president in a district that leans Republican. During a debate last month, he even refused to say whether he'd vote to re-elect Obama. Now Barber says he would, and he accuses Republicans of trying to nationalize the special election. \"This race is really about Congressional District 8, the southern part of our state, and the communities and the people that live here,\" Barber says. \"I'm not going to be drawn into a national debate about issues that have nothing to do, ultimately, with what's good for the people I hope to represent.\" Barber has outraised and outspent Kelly, but Kelly has benefited from slightly more spending by outside groups, according to the campaign finance watchdog OpenSecrets.org. Barber held a rally Saturday night with Giffords, who made a rare public appearance on behalf of her former staffer. Her husband, former astronaut Mark Kelly, stood nearby, saying Giffords' decision to step down to focus on her rehab was incredibly difficult. \"But she knew that at that point it made sense for her to step down. And the person that she knew could represent this community the way she did is this man, standing to our left,\" Kelly said at the rally. No matter who wins Tuesday's special election, both candidates say they'll be back on the campaign trail this fall, running for a full two-year term. But the winner will clearly have the advantage going into November.",

The Associated Press projected that Walker would defeat Milwaukee's Democratic Mayor Tom Barrett in what was a rematch of the 2010 gubernatorial election. The race was closely watched nationwide because it became a proxy of sorts for national politics. At the macro level, it was about different visions for the role of government. But it all stemmed from legislation, championed by Walker, that severely limited the collective-bargaining rights of public employees. Walker became a hero to some who saw public unions as a special interest that feed mercilessly off taxpayers and a foe to those who thought he was dismantling the fabric that gave workers a decent life and the prospect of a happy retirement. It was a brutal 17 months that saw nonstop protests. Unions and Democrats collected more than 900,000 signatures to trigger only the third gubernatorial recall election in U.S. history. But in the end, the GOP outraised and outmaneuvered Democrats in the state. Walker raised $30.5 million, while Barrett raised only about $4 million. In a statement, Walker said it was time to move past the divisions. \"Bringing our state together will take some time, but I hope to start right away,\" Walker said. \"It is time to put our differences aside and figure out ways that we can move Wisconsin forward.\" But at the State Capitol in Madison, the mood was one of disbelief. One Barrett supporter said Walker had destroyed the progress unions had made in the past 50 years. Maureen Zarrella, a retired teacher from St. Charles, Ill., who had participated in anti-Walker rallies in Madison and Chicago told NPR's Liz Halloran that she feared Walker's agenda \"will be a template for the rest of the country.\" \"I just hope we can keep up the courage, keep up the fight,\" she said. As NPR Political Junkie Ken Rudin has reminded us, the two governors to have been recalled were Lynn Frazier of North Dakota, who was in his third two-year term when he was recalled in October 1921 and Gray Davis of California, who was recalled in October 2003. We live-blogged all night, so keep reading if you want to see how it all developed. Update at 11:53 p.m. ET. Still In Opposition: In a statement, the Democratic Party of Wisconsin said that while they congratulate Walker, they still oppose his policies. Mike Tate, the party chair in the state, said: \"Because the debate must continue. Unions must be able to bargain collectively and provide workers with basic protections. The middle class must not be asked to give up protections built together over the years even while the richest among us sacrifice not at all. Our elected officials must speak with the public honestly and operate an open government, not flout our laws and our norms. \"And finally, regardless of party, Wisconsin must be Wisconsin again, without the big money Tea Party influence that has colonized our state, turned neighbor-against-neighbor and created an idea dangerous to democracy, that our very government is up for sale.\" Update at 11:40 p.m. ET. Making The Tough Decisions: \"In times of crisis what has made America amazing ... is that there have been men and women of courage ... who thought the future of their children and grandchildren is more important than their political future,\" Walker said during his victory speech. \"Voters want leaders who stand up and make the tough decisions,\" he said. But Walker also talked about moving forward. \"Tomorrow we are no longer opponents,\" said Walker. The governor admitted that when he took on collective bargaining, he did so in haste. He said during this recall process, he has learned that it's also important to \"listen.\" \"Now is the time to come together,\" Walker said. Update at 11:24 p.m. ET. An Update On Results: At this point, it seems obvious that the exit polls under-counted the Walker vote. The exit polls predicted a four-point victory for Walker. But with 83 percent of precincts reporting, Walker has a huge nine-point lead. That's a wider margin than which he won the governorship in 2010. The pro-Barrett \"light brigade,\" whose participants in recent weeks had positioned themselves at dusk on highway over passes.\n                \n                    \n                    Liz Halloran /NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Update at 11:05 p.m. ET. The Scene Outside The Capitol: NPR's Liz Halloran is at the State Capitol in Madison. That building became the epicenter of the anti-Walker movement. Liz sent us this report: \"The result and its swift arrival left the anti-Walker crowd here in stunned disbelief. \"'Given the polls, I thought it would be close and wouldn't be called until late,' said John Matthews, 72, who has been executive director of the local teachers' union for 44 years. \"'What we have built here the last 50 years has been destroyed by Walker. To say there's a 23-point margin \u2014 I don't think that's possible,' he said, after comforting a teacher who was in tears. \"He and others said reports of high voter turnout in Democratic strongholds like Madison and Milwaukee made the results difficult to believe. \"Maureen Zarrella, a retired teacher from St. Charles, Ill., who has participated in anti-Walker rallies in Madison and Chicago says she fears Walker's agenda 'will be a template for the rest of the country.' \"'I just hope we can keep up the courage, keep up the fight,' she said.\" Update at 11:02 p.m. ET. Echo Beyond Wisconsin: Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney released a statement that read in part: \"Tonight's results will echo beyond the borders of Wisconsin. Governor Walker has shown that citizens and taxpayers can fight back \u2013 and prevail \u2013 against the runaway government costs imposed by labor bosses. \"Tonight voters said 'no' to the tired, liberal ideas of yesterday, and 'yes' to fiscal responsibility and a new direction. I look forward to working with Governor Walker to help build a better, brighter future for all Americans.\" Update at 10:43 p.m. ET. 'Time To Put Differences Aside': In an interview with the AP, Gov. Scott Walker said the win \"feels good.\" He also said it was \"time to put our differences aside.\" Update at 10:33 p.m. ET. Money Vs. Ideas: A lot of what you will hear coming out of this election is that Democrats were outspent big. That's true, as we told you earlier. Walker raised $30.5 million, while Barrett raised only about $4 million. But as Don Gonyea told our Newscast unit earlier today, Walker raised that much money because big donors \u2014 millionaires and billionaires \u2014 saw him \"as someone who's standing up to Democrats and big labor.\" They view Walker as a hero, said Don. And this was also a crucial election for unions. \"Do or die,\" Don said. David Gergen, on CNN, said money matters but so do basic, core ideas. He said that walking around Wisconsin you heard people really debating the issue of unions, saying \"unions are too costly and are costing us too much money.\" This election, said Gergen, means people decided \"they couldn't afford it.\" Update at 10:18 p.m. ET. A Tea Party Victory: In a statement, the Tea Party Express said this race gained national attention because it echoes the themes at stake in November. \"It was a battle between conservatives policies that successfully balanced the budget and encouraged economic growth, and the big government policies found under the Obama administration,\" Amy Kremer, chairman of Tea Party Express said in a statement. \"Tonight we sent a message that should shake Obama's Chicago headquarters: tea party momentum is going to be coming strong and mercilessly in November.\" Indeed, as The Washington Post reports, this race started as a swift reaction against Tea Party ideals. Remember that to get to this point, Walker opponents had to collect thousands of signatures to trigger a recall election. But as the Post points out, the recall campaign simply energized Republicans and they were able to raise huge money and expand its turnout operation \"where Democrats traditionally have the edge.\" Update at 10:07 p.m. ET. AP Calls The Race: Republican Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker has survived his recall election, the AP projects. The AP adds: \"Walker becomes the first governor in American history to stay inoffice after a recall challenge. \"The Republican governor rose to national prominence last year after taking on public-sector unions shortly after being sworn in. That fight also triggered the recall and set up a rematch with Tom Barrett, who was defeated by Walker in 2010.\" Update at 10:03 p.m. ET. The Scene In Madison: NPR's Liz Halloran sends us this update from Madison: \"Hundreds have gathered on the steps of Wisconsin's state Capitol in Madison to await election results, cheering a group of bagpipers in red fire hats, singing and clapping as the almost exclusively pro-Barrett crowd continues to swell. A core group had been meeting daily to sing and demonstrate at the Capitol since protests began in early 2011.\" Update at 9:58 p.m. ET. ABC News And CNN Call It For Walker: ABC and CNN are now joining the fray calling the race for Walker. Update at 9:55 p.m. ET. NBC News Calls It For Walker: NBC News is projecting that Walker has survived the recall election. The call comes just as news organizations got updated exit poll numbers that indicated Walker had a four point lead over Barrett. With about 21 percent of the precincts counted, Walker maintains a sizable lead of 61 percent to 38 percent. Update at 9:28 p.m. Dems Need A Big Turnout: The New York Times' statistics guru Nate Silver tweets: \"Exit polls show a tie, but Walker's numbers look pretty decent so far in rural Wisconsin. Dems will need huge Milwaukee/Madison turnout.\" Which, if you believe Democrats, they've gotten. Here's what Times' Jeff Zeleny says on Twitter: \"Wisconsin Dems report that the final two hours in Milwaukee showed heavy turnout. Same-day registration forms were going like hotcakes.\" Update at 9:23 p.m. ET. First Results: Results are now trickling in. They don't mean much, of course, but with 2.25 percent of precincts reporting, Walker leads with 54 percent. Barrett has 45 percent. Update at 9:12 p.m. ET. In Exit Polls, Obama Maintains Big Lead: According to CNN, exit polls show that Obama has a sizable \u2014 54 percent to 42 percent \u2014 lead over Romney in the state. One thing we've neglected to touch on is that Obama did not campaign for Barrett. All the president did was send out a tweet last night in which he said, \"It's Election Day in Wisconsin tomorrow, and I'm standing by Tom Barrett. He'd make an outstanding governor. -bo\" Note that it was signed by him, which the White House has said means it was sent by the president himself. Update at 9:01 p.m. ET. Exit Polls Show A Tight Race: Polls have closed in Wisconsin and we may be in for a long night. CNN's exit poll data could not show a tighter race. The vote is split 50/50 between Walker and Barrett. NBC News agrees. Chuck Todd tweets: \"We are officially saying WI is 'too close to call'; Precinct exit data indicates total coin flip.\" Update at 8:58 p.m. ET. Protesters Gather: The Capitol in Madison has been the scene of nonstop protests for more than a year. Scott Bauer, an AP correspondent in Wisconsin, tweets that's not changing tonight: \"Protesters gathering outside Wis Capitol awaiting results in #wirecall, heavy police presence. Polls close in 4 minutes\" Update at 8:45 p.m. ET. Voters Uncomfortable With Recalls: We've got about 15 minutes to go before polls close in Wisconsin. So we'll use that time to point to another interesting bit from tonight's exit polls. As The Washington Post reports, voters have been traditionally uncomfortable with recalls. \"Just three sitting governors have faced a recall vote in all of U.S. history,\" the Post reports. In fact, of those who voted today, 60 percent said recalls are only appropriate because of misconduct. Of course that differed depending on party. The Post reports: \"Republicans said by a near unanimous margin that recall elections are never appropriate or only appropriate in the case of official misconduct. But slight majority of Democratic voters said recall elections are appropriate 'for any reason.'\" Update at 8:25 p.m. ET. A Record-Breaker: $63.5 million. That's how much the Center for Public Integrity calculates both candidates and independent groups spent on the recall election in Wisconsin. That eclipses the previous record of $37.4 million set in during the governor's race in 2010. And most of that money came from outside the state. Here's CPI with some details: \"While Barrett has received about 26 percent of his $4 million in campaign donations from outside the Badger State, Walker has drawn nearly two-thirds of his $30.5 million contributions from out of state, according to campaign filings released May 29. Walker has outraised Barrett 7 1/2 to 1 since late 2011, though Barrett didn't enter the race until late March.\" Update at 8:13 p.m. ET. What The Polls Say: If you look at polls, Walker has an edge over Barrett tonight. He has polled at around 50 percent over the past month or so. Real Clear Politics, which tracks polls, says that on average Walker leads by 6.7 points. Yesterday, Nate Silver, The New York Times' statistics guru, made a bold prediction. He said using one statistical model, Walker has a 95 percent chance of winning. Silver adds: \"One of the new polls over the weekend, from Public Policy Polling, which conducts polling on behalf of Democratic clients as well as publishes its own polls independently, showed a somewhat tighter race, with Mr. Walker's Democratic opponent, Mayor Tom Barrett of Milwaukee, having closed his deficit to three percentage points. However, the firm has showed somewhat more favorable results for Mr. Barrett than other polling firms, and this reflected a relatively minor change from the firm's previous poll, which had Mr. Walker ahead by five percentage points. \"At the same time, the Public Policy Polling survey had Mr. Walker at 50 percent of the vote and had very few undecided voters. The presence of undecided voters tends to correlate with higher unpredictability on Election Day, while the absence of them, as in this case, means that even a small lead is more likely to hold up.\" Update at 7:47p.m. ET. Heavy Turnout: How significant is this recall election in Wisconsin? In some places, the turnout is being compared to the turnout for 2008's presidential election. That's what NPR's Don Gonyea reported on All Things Considered this afternoon. In some precincts, said Don, turnout could exceed 100 percent. And, yes, that's possible when same-day registration is allowed. NPR's Liz Halloran is in the southside of Milwaukee and reports that turnout in the heavily Hispanic area has been heavy. \"There were lines \u2014 not huge, but lines,\" she tells us. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reports that turnout was so heavy in Milwaukee, the city's Election Commission called out reserve poll workers. The paper adds: \"No statewide figures were available, but local election officials offered fairly similar accounts of a heavy turnout in communities large and small, in both Democratic and Republican areas. \"In many places, election officials said turnout was as strong as, or stronger than, it was for the 2010 gubernatorial election. A few even compared it to the 2008 presidential election.\" Update at 7:23 p.m. ET. Re-Electing Obama: The New York Times' exit polling finds that voters tonight would re-elect President Obama, who also bested the Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney when voters were asked who would do a better job with the economy. The questions, however, may not help Barrett. The Times reports: \"Polling in recent weeks has shown Mr. Walker leading even as voters said they preferred keeping Mr. Obama in office. \"That may reflect a queasiness with recall elections. A large majority of the voters who turned out on Tuesday said recall elections are only appropriate when incumbents are accused of official misconduct.\" Update at 7:16 p.m. ET. Exit Polls: CNN is reporting some interesting numbers based on exit polls in Wisconsin. Among them: -- 32 percent of voters said someone in their household was a union member. 68 percent said they had no connection to a union. That's a higher union turnout than 2010 and 2008, when that number was 26 percent. -- Voters are unhappy with both parties. 50 percent have an unfavorable view of the GOP and of the Democratic party. -- Most (88 percent) made up their minds about whom to vote for before May.

Democrat Elizabeth Warren will not have to face a primary challenger in the Massachusetts Senate race. The Harvard Law School professor and consumer advocate secured more than 95 percent of the delegate vote today at her party's state convention. Lynn Jolicoeur of member station WBUR in Boston reports that Warren's margin was the largest ever in such a race in Massachusetts. Warren's challenge now is incumbent Republican Sen. Scott Brown. Democratic Party chair John Walsh said Warren would \"make Massachusetts families proud,\" as the Boston Herald reports: \"Elizabeth Warren made history today because of the strength of her impressive grassroots organization and her record as a tireless advocate for middle class families throughout Massachusetts.\" As WBUR's Jolicoeur tells our Newscast Unit, avoiding a primary with immigration attorney Marisa DeFranco means Warren can now focus all of her attention on what is expected to be a tight race with Brown. And that's just what Warren did in her speech before Saturday's vote: \"Whoever he once was, I can tell you who he is now: Scott Brown is a Wall Street Republican. A big oil Republican. A Mitt Romney Republican.\" Warren also evoked Sen. Ted Kennedy, saying she would do her \"best to honor his memory\" and that \"it's a long way from Ted Kennedy to Scott Brown.\" New polls from the Boston Globe and Western New England University show Warren and Brown are in for a battle, with only a couple percentage points between them. Warren's official nomination comes after weeks of controversy over her claims to Native American heritage. As we reported Thursday, she acknowledged that she told law schools at Harvard and University of Pennsylvania of her background. Her campaign has said that she is 1/32nd Cherokee. The Globe poll found that 72 percent of voters said the issue will not affect their vote, but 31 percent of self-described independents said it makes them less likely to support her.",

Friday is jobs day, when the federal government releases its monthly unemployment report. It's also just about five months before the presidential election. When the two presidential contenders talk about unemployment, they're trying to balance their rhetoric between optimism, pessimism and reality. It's pretty easy to figure out the political consequences of an economy adding 200,000 or more jobs a month \u2014 the way the U.S. economy did this winter. Numbers like that would clearly help President Obama. If the jobs numbers stay where they have been for the past two months, well below that, the presumptive GOP nominee Mitt Romney would get a boost. But what if it's somewhere in the middle \u2014 not great but not awful? Then it's up for interpretation and spin. Preparing For Sun, Rain Or Fog \"If people feel like the economy is getting better even slowly, that certainly helps the incumbent, but if the trends are decelerating, I'm sure that doesn't help him,\" says Jared Bernstein, former chief economist for Vice President Joe Biden. If the jobs numbers continue to disappoint, Romney has the easier task. As long as he doesn't sound like a sourpuss, talking down the economy, Romney can argue that times are tough because Obama's policies have failed. \"The consequence is that we are now enduring the most tepid recovery in modern history. The consequence is that half the kids who are graduating from college can't find a job that uses their skills. Half,\" Romney said earlier this month in Des Moines, Iowa. The president has a harder balancing act. He has to be positive without being a cheerleader for good news voters don't necessarily feel. \"Are we satisfied?\" Obama asked a crowd in Columbus, Ohio, earlier this month, referring to the number of jobs added in the past few years. They responded, \"No!\" Obama added, \"Of course not. Too many of our friends and family are still out there looking for work.\" During that rally, it helped that the president was speaking in Ohio, which, like many battleground states this year, has a lower unemployment rate than the national average. Ohio's unemployment rate during the month of April was 7.4 percent, compared with the national average of 8.1 percent. \"Yes, there were setbacks. Yes, there were disappointments. But we didn't quit. We don't quit. Together, we're fighting our way back,\" Obama said. As long as the recovery doesn't rev up, the president has to do something very complicated. While Romney can merely focus on the present, Obama has to tell a story about the past \u2014 how the economy got this way \u2014 the present and the future. Incumbent Defense The president also has to do something every incumbent with a shaky economy needs to do to get re-elected. \"The incumbent is in trouble unless he disqualifies the challenger, and that is what we need to do. We need to pose a choice, and we need to disqualify Romney,\" says Democratic pollster Celinda Lake.  This is why the Obama campaign is spending so much time and money trying to define Romney as a failed governor and a leveraged buyout artist who puts profits before people. There's some urgency to this, because in the last Battleground Poll conducted by Lake's research group, Romney was gaining ground. \"It was sobering, because Romney had been able to rehabilitate himself frankly faster than I had thought he would be able to do, and it was sobering because the two candidates were equal on the economy even though Barack Obama had a 23-point lead on being for the middle class and a 10-point lead on shares your values,\" says Lake. So far, there's little or no no evidence that the attacks on Romney's record are working \u2014 but the Obama campaign says it's still early, and aides say they plan to keep telling their version of Romney's story until Election Day. Romney, meanwhile, is pushing back, repeating his charge that the president is just a politician who has never worked in the real economy. The Experience Factor But Republican Tony Fratto, who worked for President George W. Bush, says Romney needs to tell voters why his private-sector experience matters more than the president's experience. \"It is a story that Americans intuitively understand. They know that you know all of the good things, growth and job creation ... doesn't really come from the government or government programs,\" says Fratto. He says Romney also needs to tell voters how his experience at Bain Capital relates to the larger economy. \"They don't always understand what the motivation and role of the private sector is, and I think ... that is a really important lesson to teach Americans, and it's a perfect message for Mitt Romney, given his background, to tell,\" says Fratto. A lot depends on what the Labor Department reports Friday and in the months to come. If the jobs numbers dip, Romney may not have to do much more than attack the president. But if the jobs report stays cloudy, no sun but no rain either, Romney may need to paint a fuller picture of his own policies.",

            "article_content": "One of the candidates running in Egypt's presidential election is a member of the Muslim Brotherhood. The group, Egypt's largest and best-organized political group, won almost half the seats in Parliament earlier this year. But the presidential election is more of a challenge.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: OK. So as we've heard, one big question is whether Egyptian voters will give the presidency to an Islamist candidate. The leaders in pre-election polls include a candidate from the Muslim Brotherhood, as we've heard, and there's another leading candidate who used to be in the Brotherhood. The Muslim Brotherhood already has the biggest share of seats in Egypt's parliament. And now leaders of this 84-year-old party face the challenge and the possibility of winning the presidency. Merrit Kennedy reports from Alexandria. MERRIT KENNEDY, BYLINE: Alexandria has long been a core base of support for the Muslim Brotherhood, but even here the vote for the movement's candidate Mohammed Morsi looked very close. (SOUNDBITE OF CROWD CHATTER) KENNEDY: At party headquarters here, a group of men are bent over laptops, crunching numbers and making projections about turnout of the group's supporters. Across the hall, volunteers are furiously making calls on their cell phones, trying to assess their chances. Mohamed Soudan, the foreign relations secretary of the party's Alexandria branch, says they're seeing lower turnout of their supporters than they hoped. MOHAMED SOUDAN: I don't think that this is the quantity of the amount of the people which we were looking for in the beginning. I don't know. It's not the same with the parliamentary elections. It's different. KENNEDY: He says one challenge is the amount of time they had to prepare for the election. The group had long promised not to run a presidential candidate, but reversed on that decision less than two months before the vote. Their original candidate, Khairat al-Shater, was disqualified because he served prison time under Mubarak. Mohammed Morsi, the group's second choice, moved into the spotlight just a month before the election. (SOUNDBITE OF CROWD CHATTER) KENNEDY: Morsi is popular in Alexandria, but his campaign hasn't been able to convince everyone who voted for the Brotherhood for parliament to cast ballots for him. MONA MAHMOUD IBRAHIM: (Foreign language spoken) KENNEDY: Mona Mahmoud Ibrahim, a housewife, has just cast her vote in the middle-class neighborhood of Fleming. She voted for Muslim Brotherhood candidates in the parliamentary elections, but decided she preferred former Brotherhood member and reformist candidate Abdel Moneim Aboul Fotouh for the presidency. Shadi Hamid, the director of research at the Brookings Doha Center, said in a phone interview that Aboul Fotouh's candidacy poses a serious challenge to the Brotherhood, a group known for its strict party discipline. This is the first time, he says, an individual who left the group enjoys grassroots support. SHADI HAMID: And that poses an existential threat, because it can lead to a split within the organization. People can start to say, well, why do we have to stay in the Brotherhood when we can become involved through other channels? KENNEDY: He says that now, for the first time, the Brotherhood's top position for opposition Islamist activity is being challenged. He also points to high expectations for the group in parliament that haven't been fulfilled. Mohammed Madany, a correspondent for the Brotherhood's satellite TV channel Misr 25, says another reason this election is challenging for the group is the reappearance of former regime candidates such as Ahmed Shafiq, who was Mubarak's prime minister when he was ousted from power. MOHAMMED MADANY: (Through translator) During the parliamentary elections, the forces that belonged to the former regime were unorganized. But as time has gone by, they have become now a strong bloc that seeks to restore the regime once again. That makes it more difficult for the Muslim Brotherhood. KENNEDY: Morsi's share of the vote is difficult to predict, due to conflicting poll results. Madany says the Brotherhood's campaign strategy has been direct contact with the street. Because they have supporters in all segments of society, he says, they're able to tune their message to diverse audiences. Again, analyst Shadi Hamid. HAMID: They still have a real chance of getting to the second round and even perhaps winning, because no one can challenge their ground game. KENNEDY: Despite this challenging election, he says, the Brotherhood is still unmatched in terms of grassroots support across Egypt. For NPR News, I'm Merrit Kennedy in Alexandria, Egypt.

            "article_content": "With a speech in Ohio Wednesday, Vice President Biden kept up the drum beat criticizing Mitt Romney for his work as a venture capitalist. The GOP presidential hopeful casts his business experience as a prime asset.  DAVID GREENE, HOST: This is MORNING EDITION from NPR News. Good morning. I'm David Greene. The Obama campaign has launched a coordinated attack on Mitt Romney's business record. Romney's success in the business world has been his main selling point in the White House race. President Obama and his allies are trying to undermine that, arguing that Romney made at least some of his fortune at the expense of American workers. The latest salvo came yesterday in a speech from Vice President Joe Biden. NPR's Scott Horsley reports. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Vice President Biden says since Mitt Romney's staked his campaign on his successful investing career, it's only fair to consider some of his investments that didn't work out so well - at least not for the workers at the companies he acquired. In Youngstown, Ohio yesterday, Biden told the story of a century-old Kansas City steel mill that Romney's firm Bain Capital bought in the early 1990s. VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: It had been in business since 1888, when Romney and his partners bought that company. Eight years later that company was in bankruptcy. HORSLEY: By that time Romney had left Bain to oversee the Olympics. But he continued to share in the company's profits, even though 750 steelworkers ended up losing their jobs. BIDEN: Romney made sure the guys on top got to play by a separate set of rules. He ran up massive debts and the middle class lost. And folks, he thinks that experience is going to help our economy. HORSLEY: Biden's speech is part of a coordinated campaign. At news conferences this week in Ohio and Florida, Democrats pointed to other instances in which Romney's firm made money, even though the companies it acquired failed, and workers lost jobs. That's also the message behind a new TV ad from a pro-Obama superPAC. The commercial features a steelworker named Pat Wells from that shuttered plant in Kansas City. (SOUNDBITE OF AD) PAT WELLS: Whether the companies they came in and worked with made money or not was irrelevant. Bain Capital always made money. If we lost, they made money. If we survived, they made money. It's as simple as that. HORSLEY: Romney's faced similar attacks before, from his Republican primary opponents earlier this year and in his first Senate race against Ted Kennedy almost two decades ago. The attacks are designed to turn Romney's business success from an asset into a liability. At a campaign rally earlier this month, President Obama himself suggested there's something wrong with Romney's bottom line. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: He doesn't seem to understand that maximizing profits by whatever means necessary, whether through layoffs or outsourcing or tax avoidance or union busting, might not always be good for the average American or for our economy. HORSLEY: According to the Los Angeles Times, four of the top 10 companies that Bain Capital invested in while Romney was in charge ultimately went bankrupt, though Bain still made a profit on three of them. Romney spokesman Ryan Williams says that's the nature of free enterprise. RYAN WILLIAMS: As somebody who spent his life in the private sector, he understands that there are successes and failures. And he obviously learned from both his successes and failures in the private sector. HORSLEY: Romney appeared on a conservative podcast yesterday and repeated the claim that overall his investment firm helped companies add jobs. He ducked questions about the vice president's speech from the traveling press, though. Spokesman Williams says that's deliberate. WILLIAMS: This election is a referendum on the incumbent president and his administration, and we intend to keep the focus on that issue. HORSLEY: For its part, the Obama campaign is determined to widen that focus, to include Romney's record as well. Scott Horsley, NPR News, the White House. Copyright \u00a9 2012 NPR.

            "article_content": "The Obama campaign on Wednesday escalated its attack on Mitt Romney's business career, with Vice President Joe Biden scheduled to aggressively question how Romney's management of Bain Capital might translate into running the U.S. economy. On Monday, Obama's re-election campaign unveiled a new swing state ad questioning Romney's assertion that he was a job creator while running the private equity firm. The Romney campaign countered later in the day with its own ad. On Tuesday, the Obama campaign's mantra was picked up by the pro-Obama superPAC Priorities USA Action, in what was officially (and by law) an uncoordinated ad \u2014 albeit, one with a very similar storyline. And on Wednesday, Biden is scheduled to take the fight directly to Romney during a speech in Youngstown, Ohio. \"He thinks that because he spent his career as a 'businessman,' he has the experience to run the economy. So let's take a look at a couple of things he did,\" Biden is to say, according to excerpts released by the campaign. Romney has defended his work at Bain as \u2014 among other things \u2014 helping struggling companies and helping to create jobs in total. He also has acknowledged that not all of Bain's efforts were successful, and has said he welcomes the focus on economics in a faceoff with President Obama. But the Bain-specific attacks mirror some charges made before Romney's 1994 loss to Sen. Edward Kennedy in Massachusetts, and others from early in this year's GOP primary campaign. Biden, in the noon speech, is to say: \"Folks, this election is going to create a stark and fundamental choice between two different economic philosophies. ... In the 1990s, there was a steel mill in Kansas City, Mo. It had been in business since 1888. Then Romney and his partners bought the company. Eight years later it went bankrupt.\" While Romney worked at Bain when GST Steel was acquired, he had left Bain to run the Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City two years before GST Steel went bankrupt. The Biden excerpts also say: \"Romney made sure the guys on top got to play by a separate set of rules, he ran massive debts, and the middle class lost. And, folks, he thinks this experience will help our economy? Where I come from, past is prologue. So what do you think he'll do as president?\" Romney is campaigning in the swing state of Florida on Wednesday, and the Miami Herald's Adam C. Smith reports that the Obama campaign's anti-Bain attacks are taking place on a state level as well. \"At the heart of Romney's presidential campaign is an argument that his successful business record makes him best equipped to turn around the economy. Democrats are aiming to turn his strength into a vulnerability \u2014 a strategy that has worked before,\" Smith writes.",

            "article_content": "The Obama re-election committee on Monday released a two-minute ad taking aim at Republican rival Mitt Romney's record at the private equity firm Bain Capital. The ad challenges Romney's claim that his business experience qualifies him to turn the economy around.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: It didn't take long after the JPMorgan news broke for President Obama's campaign to seize an opportunity. A campaign ad rips Mitt Romney for his tenure at the head of a private equity firm. Here's NPR's Mara Liasson. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: The ad is a two-minute trial balloon airing for just one day in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Iowa and Colorado. It goes after Romney's central claim that his business experience qualifies him to turn the American economy around. The ad portrays Romney as a heartless buyout artist who piled up companies with debt, enriched investors, then let the companies go bankrupt. It features workers laid off from GST Steel, which Romney's company, Bain Capital, bought in 1993. (SOUNDBITE OF POLITICAL ADVERTISEMENT) LIASSON: Stephanie Cutter, of the Obama campaign, says Romney's policies would benefit the rich, and leave the middle-class workers behind. STEPHANIE CUTTER: This is about the values Romney lived by, and the values he's promising to live by as the president. LIASSON: Cutter said the issue is not the private equity industry as a whole. Indeed, Mr. Obama attended a fundraiser last night at the home of a top executive at the world's largest private equity firm. The Obama ad, however, got some unexpected criticism from a former Obama economic adviser, Steve Rattner, who called the ad unfair. STEVEN RATTNER: Bain Capital's responsibility was not to create 100,000 jobs. It was to make profits for its investors. So yeah, I do think, to pick out an example of somebody who lost their job - unfortunately, this is part of capitalism; this is part of life. LIASSON: The Romney campaign countered with a Web video featuring positive testimonials from workers at another steel company, SDI, that Romney and Bain Capital owned for about five years in the 1990s.

The campaign has sparked lively interest around the country, as the candidates appear at campaign rallies and on televised talk shows. The election is also the major topic of conversation in many Egyptian living rooms.  MELISSA BLOCK, HOST: Later this month, Egyptians will vote in their country's first truly competitive presidential election. Campaign billboards line the highways; candidates are debating each other, speaking on the stump and making the rounds of political talk shows. And as Kimberly Adams reports from Cairo, Egyptian families are hosting their own informal debates. (SOUNDBITE OF CARS) KIMBERLY ADAMS, BYLINE: The normally slow traffic in Cairo becomes even more jammed up than usual on Friday and Saturday nights, as Cairenes pack into their cars to go on family visits. It's common here for people to meet with their extended families on a weekly or bi-weekly basis, usually at the home of an older relative. In the upper middle class neighborhood of Heliopolis, a collection of aunts, uncles, and cousins meets in the fashionably decorated living room of 79-year-old Zeina Hamza. Before last year's revolution, she says these family gatherings were just a chance to catch up. ZEINA HAMZA: Talk about everything; about expensive food, whatever you think about - anything. ADAMS: But since then, the conversation has changed. Her granddaughter, Nourhan Osama, is 20 and studies law and English. NOURHAN OSAMA: You need a conversation, we're completely different about. No, we never talked about politics, never ever - never ever. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: (Foreign language spoken) OSAMA: Yes, never ever about anything. We weren't interested. ADAMS: There's no doubt they are interested now. Political sociologist Said Sadek, who teaches at the American University in Cairo, says these family get-togethers have been a key outlet for political debate in the 15 months since the ouster of President Hosni Mubarak. SAID SADEK: In Egyptian families who were not usually interested in politics and they were only interested in daily events and entertainment and things like that, politics became very important because it began to affect their lives and now they began to feel that politics are important. ADAMS: Sadek says the family meetings often reveal the gap in opinion between younger and older generations. That gap exists in Hamza's family. Her granddaughter, Sally, won't support any candidate with ties to the former regime, but Sally's mother supports Mubarak's one-time foreign minister, Amr Moussa, who is among the frontrunners. But, in this upper middle class family, there is some common ground. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN 2: At least all of us - all of us agree on one thing, that none of us are voting for the Islamists. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN 3: Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN 2: OK. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN 3: And I'm (unintelligible), so - no. ADAMS: But some 15 miles outside Cairo in the economically distressed village of Suqayl, posters for Islamist candidates on the sides of dilapidated apartment buildings show the community's support for more conservative leadership. To get to the home of Hayat Ahmed Dawoot, you have to step around huge holes in the dirt road. Men are using cell phones for light as they dig the village's first sewer system. Inside Dawoot's home, she and her sister, Hekma, both in their 70s, preside over their meeting of adult children, in-laws and small grandchildren. Many in this family support the Muslim Brotherhood candidate, Mohammed Morsi, because they want a president who plans to bring Islamic values to the job. But others in the Dawoot family want a more secular candidate. There's support for Amr Moussa here, as well as former prime minister, Ahmed Shafit. Even though the debate can get a bit heated at times, Hekma Dawoot enjoys the exchange of ideas. HEKMA DAWOOT: (Through Translator) Before, people could not talk, but now everyone has an opinion and has freedom. It is very good. The country is better than before. ADAMS: Political sociologist Sadek says the revolution has put Egypt through a crash course in political participation. SADEK: And, in the last one year and a half during this transition, the Egyptians are learning everything that they didn't know about politics, from how to write constitution, what is a constitutional assembly, what is a free election, fair election - all the things that did not exist. ADAMS: The Hamza and Dawoot families may not agree on which candidate to support, but they do agree on one thing - they're all planning to vote. For NPR News, I'm Kimberly Adams in Cairo.

Ghanbari/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption President Obama speaks during a campaign rally at Ohio State University, Saturday in Columbus, Ohio. President Obama says the country has come too far in the last four years to change course now. He kicked off his re-election campaign Saturday with a pair of high-profile rallies in two pivotal states, Ohio and Virginia. Obama acknowledged the economic recovery still has a long way to go. Yet he argued his Republican challenger, Mitt Romney, would move the country backward, not forward. Unsatisfied With Unemployment The president's first official re-election rallies had some of the trappings of his 2008 campaign: huge crowds, stirring music, even the old standby chant of \"Fired Up, Ready to Go.\" Obama said this campaign is still about hope and change, though he acknowledged many hopes were dashed by the severe recession that cost 3 million jobs in the six months before he took office. \"It was tough. But I tell you what, Ohio. The American people are tougher,\" he said. The president stressed the 4 million jobs that private employers have added in the last two years. Voters got another reminder, though, of the uneven pace of that recovery with a weaker-than-expected jobs report on Friday. \"Are we satisfied? Of course not. Too many of our friends and family are still out there looking for work,\" he said. Obama is eager to frame the election not as a referendum on the last four years, but rather a choice between his agenda and the Republicans'. He said the important question is not whether you're better off now than before the economic crisis hit, but whose policies will make you and the country better off in the future. 'We Tried It Their Way' He argued that Romney has drawn the wrong lesson from his own successful business career. Outsourcing jobs or busting unions might help an individual company's bottom line, Obama said, but it's not the right course for average Americans or the U.S. economy. \"The true measure of our prosperity is more than just a running tally of every balance sheet and quarterly profit report,\" he said. \"I don't care how many ways you try to explain it. Corporations aren't people. People are people.\" Obama argued that Romney would rubber-stamp the agenda of congressional Republicans, with big tax cuts for the wealthy, big cuts in spending on programs for the middle class and fewer regulations on Wall Street and insurance companies. He said that's the same agenda Republicans pursued before the financial crisis. \"They're just hoping you won't remember what happened the last time we tried it their way,\" Obama said. \"Virginia, I'm here to say that we were there. We remember. And we're not going back. We're moving this country forward.\" Supporters in the crowd waved blue placards that read \"Forward,\" and red signs that said, \"Not Back.\" Putting Up A Fight Romney campaign spokeswoman Andrea Saul issued a statement saying, \"No matter how many lofty campaign speeches President Obama gives, the fact remains that American families are struggling on his watch.\" Both sides are already campaigning hard in battleground states. Pete Snyder heads a Republican organizing effort in Virginia. \"We are not leaving any ounce, any yard of this football field to Barack Obama and the Democrats this year,\" he says. \"Look, in 2008, we got our clocks cleaned on the ground. You know it. We know it. We're never going to let that happen again.\" One function of the president's rallies Saturday was to sign up and motivate his own volunteers. Supporters were urged to register voters and campaign door-to-door between now and November, with first lady Michelle Obama stressing that the race is likely to decided by a relative handful of votes. \"So with every door you knock on, with every single call you make, every single conversation, I want you to remember, this could be the one, right? This could be the one that makes the difference,\" she said. \"And that is the kind of impact that each of you can have in this election.\" The preliminaries are over. The general election campaign is underway.",

            "article_content": "Justin Wolfers, an economist known for, among other things, his sardonic wit, may have made the best comment of the day on the heels of the April jobs report out Friday. He tweeted: \"The worst part of today's jobs report? It provides just enough inane talking points for both sides of politics.\" Of course, that could probably be said most first Fridays of the month during a general-election year when Democrats and Republicans try to extract any advantage they can from the latest employment report from the U.S. Labor Department. In any event, what is or isn't considered inane is typically in the eyes of the partisan beholder. What isn't in dispute is that the party in power always tries to focus voter attention on whatever part of the report that can be seen as the half-full glass while the out of power party always points out the half-empty glass. The report showed the economy adding the fewest jobs \u2014 115,000 \u2014 since October. It also indicated that the percentage of people of working age who were actually working or seeking employment fell to its lowest point since 1981. That helps explain why the unemployment rate fell to 8.1 percent. Still, Obama and others in his White House stressed the positive, as you'd expect, since the greatest threat to his re-election would be the widespread perception that he doesn't have the cure for what ails the economy. At an appearance at Washington-Lee High School in Arlington, VA Friday morning, Obama said: \"After the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, our businesses have created more than 4.2 million new jobs over the last 26 months. More than one million jobs in the last six months alone. So that's the good news. But there are still a lot of folks out of work which means that we've got to do more. If we're going to recover all the jobs that were lost during the recession, and if we're going to build a secure economy that strengthens the middle class, than we're going to have to do more...\" Mitt Romney, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, interpreted the report as yet one more signal failure to lay at Obama's feet and another reason why he and not the Democratic president should be in the White House. On Fox News he said: \"Well, we should be seeing numbers in the 500,000 jobs created per month. This is way, way, way off from what should happen in a normal recovery. The reason that you're seeing the unemployment rate go down is because you have more people dropping out of the workforce than you have getting jobs. It's a terrible and very disappointing report this morning. Clearly the American people are wondering why this recovery isn't happening faster, why it's taking years and years for the recovery to occur and we seem to be slowing down, not speeding up. This is not progress, this is very, very disappointing and a lot of American people are having hard times and this is not good news this morning.\" Actually, most economists would be ecstatic if the economy started to create 250,000 jobs a month, or half the number Romney cited. That's especially true since the Great Recession wasn't your father's typical business-cycle recession but contractions caused by a financial crisis of the type that hit in 2007 generally take much longer to recover from, according to experts like Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff in their book \"This Time Is Different: Eight Centuries of Financial Folly\" If there continues to be an irony in the how the jobs situation is playing out, it's that Obama, who embodies his party's general warmth to government workers compared with Republicans, has presided over a particularly bad period for those employees. On his watch, they have seen the number of government jobs shrink significantly while private-sector jobs have expanded. Matter of fact, one of the biggest wet blankets on the economy has been job losses at the state and city levels as recession-strapped governments have thrown teachers and other public workers overboard. The Washington Post recently examined the situation and how it has militated against Obama's efforts to boost the overall economy. The trend continued in April, with governments cutting 13,000 jobs during the month, bringing the total government jobs lost since Obama became president in January 2009 to 607,000. As the Post story reports, many government job cuts would've likely happened sooner, and there would have been more of them, without the stimulus money Obama and Congress directed to the states in 2009 as part of the American Recovery Act. The president was able to get some additional aid to states and locals approved by Congress but not as much as he had thought necessary.",

While these are the first official rallies, the president's campaign is well under way. He's just back from a tour of college campuses in three other battleground states.  (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: It's MORNING EDITION from NPR News. Good morning. I'm Steve Inskeep. RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: And I'm Renee Montagne. For the president, next week is being billed as the official launch of his re-election campaign. Mr. Obama will be holding rallies in the swing states of Ohio and Virginia. But it would be hard to tell a difference from this week, when Mr. Obama made a tour of college campuses in three other battleground states. NPR's Scott Horsley reports on what might be called the overture to the 2012 contest. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: This week's trip was a kind of tune-up for the fall campaign. Like the Hawkeye Marching Band that opened for him yesterday at the University of Iowa, the president is easing his way into general election mode - practicing the scales you'll be hearing a lot more of between now and November. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"THE STARS AND STRIPES FOREVER\") HORSLEY: Mr. Obama showed he can still fill a basketball arena. Speaking to thousands of supporters in Iowa, Colorado, and North Carolina, he delivered a variation on the theme he introduced last year in Osawatomie, Kansas: attacking the rise of income inequality and defending a strong middle class. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: I don't want this to be a country where a shrinking number of people are doing really, really well, and then a growing number are barely able to get by. I don't want that future for you. I don't want it for my daughters. I don't want it for America. (SOUNDBITE OF APPLAUSE) HORSLEY: The official business on this trip was a call for Congress to preserve low-cost student loans. But that's just one small illustration of the president's larger campaign theme that we're all in this together. And that Americans -especially those who are most successful - have an obligation to everyone else. OBAMA: You, me, all of us, we're here because somebody somewhere - starting with our parents or our grandparents or our great-grandparents, they made an investment not just in themselves but in each other and in the future of our country. And now it's our turn. It's our turn to keep that promise alive. HORSLEY: Roberta Aragon is still inspired by that message, just as she was four years ago. (SOUNDBITE OF CROWD) ROBERTA ARAGON: That was the first time I ever voted was for him. So he made me change my mind. I'll be a voter for the rest of my life, because I think it does make a difference, somebody that actually cares for the American people - not like red, blue. It's about American people. HORSLEY: But polls suggest many young people are not as enthusiastic as they were last time. Their impatience with the slow economic recovery was reflected in Andrew Speck's impatience, as he waited for the president to speak. ANDREW SPECK: Just kind of curious. I don't know though now, I mean it's been two hours and nothing's happened. So not that good. HORSLEY: Regimented Souza marches and set piece speeches aren't always a winning formula. Sometimes, politicians have to improvise. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"WE WANT THE FUNK\") HORSLEY: You know, the president's in campaign mode when he makes a seemingly impromptu visit to a local restaurant - camera crews in tow. (SOUNDBITE OF CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) HORSLEY: In Colorado this week, Mr. Obama stopped by a burger and pizza joint called The Sink, that's popular with university students. Business major Elaine Fairbanks pitched him on her idea for a cheese fry restaurant. It sounds good, the president said. It sounds low calorie, also. ELAINE FAIRBANKS: I have lots of great ideas. But that's the first thing I could think of. HORSLEY: Fairbanks called the encounter awesome, but nerve-wracking. Outside the restaurant, there were more nerves on display, when a woman named Kolbi Zerbest spilled what appeared to be yogurt on the president's trousers. OBAMA: More hazardously, she spilled yogurt on the Secret Service, which you just... HORSLEY: The president quickly dried off his pants. Zerbest wound up on \"The Today Show.\" That's how it goes on the campaign trail. One minute, you're wowing fans with your vision of a strong, inclusive economy. The next, you're scrubbing a smoothie off your pants. If you want to be president, you've got to roll with it. Scott Horsley, NPR News. Copyright \u00a9 2012 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Mitt Romney's presidential campaign is trying to end the deficit it's running with Latino voters by stepping up its outreach efforts. President Barack Obama leads the presumptive Republican nominee by 40 percentage points among Latinos, according to the latest Pew Research Center poll. In 2008, Obama carried two-thirds of the Latino vote, and just this week, the Obama re-election campaign released four Spanish-language ads. The Republican National Committee's director of Hispanic outreach, Bettina Inclan, spoke to NPR's Scott Simon on Weekend Edition to explain how Republicans expect to close that gap. Inclan acknowledges that the GOP has a lot to of work to do to connect with Hispanics. This week, the RNC announced the appointment of six Hispanic outreach directors in the key swing states of Colorado, Florida, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina and Virginia. \"The reason that we are putting people on the ground is because each of these communities is different. Hispanics are not a monolithic vote. They're different communities with different priorities,\" says Inclan. She says Republicans can gain ground by focusing the discussion on the economy. A Pew Research Survey conducted last December, found that half of the Latino voters surveyed considered jobs to be an extremely important issue; only a third of those surveyed considered immigration an extremely important issue. \"The one thing that does tie them all together is the number one issue for the last two years for Hispanics \u2014 in poll after poll \u2014 has been the economy and jobs,\" said Inclan. \"That's a direct reflection of the poor track record of President Barack Obama.\" Meanwhile, Romney has faced criticism for his stance on immigration, including comments he made during the GOP primary debates that when faced with tough immigration laws, illegal immigrants would choose self-deportation. Obama's campaign, meanwhile, is highlighting the president's record on the economy and efforts to improve access to education for Latinos. They say the president's administration has kept millions of Latinos from falling out of the middle class.",

People who file at the last minute \u2014 and Tuesday is this year's deadline \u2014 are somewhat more likely to owe money to the government. And if Congress and the president don't act, next year could see many more Americans paying higher taxes. That's not because either President Obama or presumptive Republican challenger Mitt Romney advocate a tax increase for most Americans. Last week in St. Louis, Romney received applause when he declared: \"Instead of raising taxes, I'm going to cut 'em.\" Obama is almost as tax averse, limiting his call for tax hikes to the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans. He has called for tax hikes only for those making $250,000 a year or more. A Bush-Era Tradition And yet, the way the tax law is now written, 2012 could mark the end of more than a decade of rock-bottom taxes. \"Potentially, we could see the biggest tax increase in modern history\" in 2013, says Bob Williams of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. The tax cuts championed by President George W. Bush a decade ago, and extended in 2010, are due to expire at year's end. That would mean higher taxes at every level of income, as well as higher taxes on dividends, inheritance and capital gains. \"The biggest hits would be on the very wealthy,\" says Williams. \"Those are the people who've benefited most from the Bush-era tax cuts. But people at the very bottom would be hit as well.\" All of this will happen automatically unless Congress and the president act in concert to prevent it. \"It's the do-nothing option,\" says Williams. \"If Congress does nothing, taxes go up automatically.\" Not everyone is alarmed by that. New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg told CBS last month that taxes have to go up for everyone in order to put a dent in the federal budget. \"Most of this country is middle class. And that's where most of the tax revenue is. So if you want to raise $4 trillion over the next 10 years, which gets you halfway \u2014 only halfway \u2014 to a balanced budget, everybody's taxes have to go up,\" said Bloomberg. Action, Or 'Benign Neglect'? Economist Diane Lim Rogers of the deficit-watchdog Concord Coalition agrees that stemming the tide of red ink will require more tax revenue. But she sees some problems with letting the Bush-era tax cuts expire all at once. \"It wouldn't be the worst thing that could happen,\" says Rogers. \"I think economists would prefer that instead of things happening out of benign neglect, that better things could happen out of good policymaking.\" And Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke warns that a sudden, automatic increase in tax rates across the board next year could weaken a still fragile economy. Rogers says a better approach would be to gradually close some of the special loopholes and deductions in the tax code that cost the government more than $1 trillion a year. \"The federal government spends a lot of money on benefit programs for the rich,\" says Rogers. \"It just spends that money through the tax system rather than on the direct spending side of the budget.\" But any big rewrite of the tax code is politically challenging. Hopes for a grand budget bargain fell apart last year when Obama pressed for more tax revenue, and Republicans refused. If Obama wins re-election in November, Bloomberg thinks the threat of automatic tax hikes will give him more negotiating leverage with Congress. \"All the president has to do is say, 'I am going to veto any bill that tries to stop the automatic ending of the Bush-era tax cuts for everybody,' \" explains Bloomberg. \"And then everybody's taxes will go up.\"",

On Monday night in Philadelphia, he spoke to activists from Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Delaware, and what might have been a tough crowd turned out to be just the opposite. The event in the stately rotunda of the Franklin Institute in downtown Philadelphia was more formal than you often get at a Tea Party gathering. The crowd featured more blue blazers than American-flag shirts. And the usual grumbling about Romney's conservative credentials was noticeably absent. Teri Adams, the president of the Independence Hall Tea Party Association set a welcoming tone. And a giant statue of Benjamin Franklin towered over the proceedings. Romney immediately struck a favorite Tea Party theme by talking about the nation's Founding Fathers. His speech was full of references to liberty and freedom. \"President Obama thinks the economy is struggling because the stimulus wasn't big enough. The economy is struggling because government is too big, and we're going to bring it down to size,\" Romney told the crowd. And he ended by saying the campaign is going to be fun \u2014 and by asking for Tea Party help in defeating Obama.

Meg Shaffer, who sat in the front row, works in management and says just a few months ago she couldn't imagine voting for Romney; she was a Herman Cain fan.

You have to reach out to different groups in different ways,\" he says. Still, it's an open question how hard the Tea Party will actually work for Romney. That will depend on one thing, says New Jersey Tea Party member Bill Miller. \"At this point, the only thing he can possibly do is who he picks for V.P., who's going to be his people that he's going to work with going forward,\" he says.

Don Gonyea, NPR News, Philadelphia. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: As Romney works to consolidate support in his party, he has a shot at a kind of candidate's honeymoon now, facing less Republican opposition, a fresh look from the media and anticipation about his vice presidential choice. Romney enters that period trailing President Obama in the polls, but within striking range. Real Clear Politics, which compiles an average of public opinion polls, finds the president leading by about three points: 47-44 percent. Here's the downside for Romney: He is emerging from the fiercely contested primary season to find close to half of Americans hold an unfavorable view of him. Copyright \u00a9 2012 NPR.

Paul Ryan, R-Wis., with its sharp cuts in domestic spending and lower tax rates. Both sides see it as a winning issue for the fall campaign. The Obama campaign likes to call it the \"Romney-Ryan budget\" \u2014 and Romney hasn't objected. On the campaign trail in Wisconsin, Ryan was a constant presence with Romney before that state's April 3 Republican primary, which Romney won. Romney embraced both the plan and its author, the House Budget Committee chairman, saying he and Ryan are \"on the same page.\" How Big Of A Risk? Linking himself to Ryan's proposed tax cuts and structural reforms for Medicare was a bold conservative move, says Vin Weber, an informal adviser to the Romney campaign. \"It helped with the Republican base, and it helped unify the Republican Party more broadly than that,\" says Weber. \"But I think at the end of the day the question is, 'Will a serious approach to reforming Medicare \u2014 and thus dealing with our long-term debt problem \u2014 be a winning issue in the fall, or won't it be?' I genuinely fear for the country if it's not. But it is an open question.\" So, there is some risk for Romney. President Obama is trying to make it as big a risk as possible. \"It is a Trojan horse. Disguised as deficit-reduction plans, it is really an attempt to impose a radical vision on our country,\" Obama said last week in Washington. \"It is thinly veiled social Darwinism.\" Ryan and Romney say they would balance out the lower tax rates for the wealthy by eliminating tax breaks, but they haven't identified a single one. And as long as they leave that part of their plan blank, says Democratic strategist Geoff Garin, the Obama campaign is free to fill it in. \"In the world of compare-and-contrast politics, the Ryan budget creates a backdrop,\" says Garin. \"We're talking about the possibility of Romney shifting more of the tax burden onto the middle class from the very wealthy, even as also cutting things that middle-class families depend on, including student loans, job-training programs at community colleges, and Medicare benefits for the elderly.\" The Independent Equation But Romney's embrace of the Ryan plan might help him with one key group of voters. If we go through this entire campaign and don't talk about the tough measure of fixing the budget, then nobody's going to understand what the real kinds of choices are. Maya MacGuineas, Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget \"Independents are extremely deficit sensitive,\" says Jim Kessler of the centrist Democratic group Third Way. \"We just came out of a poll where once again, they rated it by far the No. 1 issue that they're both angry about and that they're worried about. And I think the Ryan budget puts it in play in the presidential race more than it had been in the past few months.\" In current polls, independent voters favor the president. But in the latest Washington Post-ABC News poll, Romney got higher marks than the president on handling the deficit. Of course, the deficit and tax reform aren't just campaign issues; they're urgent national problems that will have to be addressed by the next president and Congress. Maya MacGuineas of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a bipartisan nonprofit, thinks the Obama-Romney debate may make that harder to do. Fiscal Realities \"It's all fine and good to talk about cutting unnecessary spending or raising taxes on the wealthy, because those things sound harmless to most people,\" says MacGuineas. After a year of deficit commissions and supercommittees educating the public, the candidates are taking the debate backward, because neither is talking about the hard parts of budget cuts and tax reform, says MacGuineas. \"The Obama campaign hasn't gone nearly far enough yet in talking about how it would specifically reform and fix entitlement programs,\" she says. \"And likewise, the Romney campaign has talked a lot about the rates it wants to lower, but not at all the tax breaks that it wants to get rid of to offset those costs. And if we go through this entire campaign and don't talk about the tough measures of fixing the budget, then nobody's going to understand what the real kinds of choices are.\" And voters will be unprepared for the kinds of sacrifices they'll surely be asked to make after the election.",

            "article_content": "Now that Rick Santorum has suspended his campaign for the Republican presidential nomination, it appears Mitt Romney will be the nominee. Does Santorum figure into Romney's calculation of a running mate?  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Let's turn next to NPR's Mara Liasson. Mara, good morning. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Good morning, Steve. INSKEEP: So what does Santorum's decision mean? LIASSON: Well, on one level it's a huge milestone. It really does wrap this up for Mitt Romney. On the other hand, it changes very little because Romney was already moving ahead with plans for the general election. The general election fight was already underway. The president and Romney were - are engaging each other directly. But this does make it official and it's only April - we were talking about having this race drag on till June. INSKEEP: This has got to give - save Romney some time and also some money that he can deploy in other ways. LIASSON: Yes, I think there are a lot of things this allows Romney to do that he couldn't have done while Santorum was still in the race. It probably will accelerate the pace at which the Republican superPACs move in on Romney's behalf. It certainly helps Romney, as you said, on fundraising, stops the drain on his coffers that the primaries had turned out to be. He doesn't have to go through this next spate of Southern primaries, which would have only demonstrated his continuing weaknesses with the conservative base. Now he can turn his full attention to repairing the damage with conservatives, with evangelicals, with Hispanics, with women, without the distraction, however minimal, from the primary fight with Santorum. INSKEEP: I'm reminded of that remark, that unfortunate remark, about a Romney advisor - by a Romney advisor about Etch-a-sketch. This is the moment when Romney can shake things up, I suppose. LIASSON: He can, and he will get a shave and a haircut and a fresh look from voters, a lot of voters who haven't paid any attention up until now. INSKEEP: And does Santorum figure, though, as a possible Romney running mate? I mean it seems that he's finished second here. LIASSON: Well, I don't think so. I think maybe if Santorum had been able to raise hundreds of millions of dollars and been more of a threat to Romney, he could have put more pressure on Romney to make it more necessary for him to pick a social conservative as a running mate. But I think the short list is the same as it's been: Rob Portman, Marco Rubio, Paul Ryan, Chris Christie, John Thune, Bobby Jindal and Bob McDonnell. I don't think the list has changed. INSKEEP: Most of the people you've mentioned there are governors, popular governors in one way or another across the country or in their individual states; a senator or two as well. LIASSON: That's right. INSKEEP: OK. So let's talk about the general election then. Here we are. We're starting it up. How does it look? LIASSON: Well, I think that it looks like it's going to be a very hard fought, very negative fight between a vulnerable incumbent and a weak challenger. Both men are trying to paint this as a stark and divisive choice as possible, Romney attacking the president for being a failed president who's increased unemployment and debt, Obama attacking Romney for having policies that would protect the wealthy and hurt the middle-class. The polls show at this moment a very small edge for President Obama. Romney has some trouble with independents, with women and Hispanics. But there are other signs that are ominous for the president in those polls. He has real weaknesses when it comes to handling the economy. In the money race, I think the two men are not only even, but it's possible that Republicans will have an edge all in when you count the SuperPACs. So I think this race is off and running, and it's very evenly matched. INSKEEP: Is it possible, Mara, that because Romney has turned out to be the nominee instead of one of the other candidates, that actually the choice when you get down to it won't appear all that stark to many voters? Romney may struggle to prove that Obama is all that different from him. And Obama may struggle to prove that Romney is all that extreme. LIASSON: Hmm. I think that the amount of effort in message and television advertising that will be spent to prove the opposite of what you just said is going to be overwhelming. INSKEEP: Oh sure. The money... LIASSON: I think it's not in either of these guys' interest to make it look like they're similar. I think that the way the race is shaping up, it looks like a very stark choice. As a matter of fact, last night President Obama said this is going to be the starkest choice since Johnson and Goldwater. INSKEEP: So whether it is or not, that's what they're going to be telling us, and the way they're going to be framing their arguments and the way they stand for issues. LIASSON: That's right. INSKEEP: OK, Mara, thanks very much. LIASSON: Thank you, Steve. INSKEEP: That's NPR's national political correspondent Mara Liasson speaking with us on this morning after Rick Santorum dropped out of the Republican presidential race. Newt Gingrich is still running. Ron Paul is still running. But it appears that Mitt Romney has it wrapped up. Copyright \u00a9 2012 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "President Obama, with millionaires and their assistants, makes a point on the \"Buffett Rule\" in Washington, DC, Wednesday, April 11, 2012.\n                \n                    \n                    Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption President Obama, with millionaires and their assistants, makes a point on the \"Buffett Rule\" in Washington, DC, Wednesday, April 11, 2012. For President Obama, the Buffett Rule is the political equivalent of a Swiss army knife, a tool he clearly intends to use any number of ways as he fights to be re-elected and deny the White House to Republican Mitt Romney. From the Democrats' perspective, the proposed rule, which would require that superwealthy taxpayers with at least $1 million in taxable income after deductions, pay taxes at a minimum 30 percent rate, has so much going for it, they can hardly stop talking about it. Which explains why Obama touted the rule at a campaign-style event in Florida Tuesday and again at the White House Wednesday, and why Senate Democrats plan to bring the rule up for a vote soon even though it has no chance of passage. For Obama and fellow Democrats, what's not to like? First, polls indicate a majority of Americans support as a matter of fairness the idea of the richest Americans paying more in taxes, the concept at the very heart of the Buffett Rule. It was, after all, billionaire investor Warren Buffett who in recent years has publicly decried the unfairness of a system that lets him, one of the world's richest men, to pay taxes at a lower rate than his secretary, all because the federal government taxes income from certain investments at a much lower rate than it taxes income from work. Second, for Obama and his fellow Democrats, the Buffett Rule is a chance to put Romney, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, on the defensive. The rule can be used by Democrats to underscore their message that not only is Romney very rich but that he also can't relate to the concerns of the average voter. It's another opportunity to get the news media to focus on the fact that in 2010 Romney and his wife Ann paid a 13.9 percent tax rate on $27 million of taxable income. That was a much lower rate than that paid by many middle class Americans and below the 26.3 percent rate Obama paid on $1.7 million in taxable income in 2010. Considering the purpose to which Democrats are putting it, they could just as easily refer to the rule as the \"the buffet (as in pummel) Romney rule.\" Third, it allows Obama and other Democrats to paint Republican politicians as much more unreasonable and unwilling to compromise on the issue of increasing taxes than voters generally. Fourth, the Buffett Rule debate allows Obama to fire up his progressive base, for whom the issue of income inequality is a priority. So the Buffett Rule fight, at first blush, would seem to have more upside potential as an issue for Obama and Democrats than for Romney and his fellow Republicans. Peter Fenn, head of Fenn Communications Group, a well-known media consultant to Democratic campaigns, sees the Buffett Rule discussion as important if only one part of the Obama campaign's overall stress on the need to correct the tilt in the economy towards the superrich: \"If it's done right, it puts Obama, I think, squarely fighting for average wage earners and that's exactly where he needs to be.\" Fenn said his sense was that many Americans, including many Republicans, feel that the benefits to the super wealthy had gotten so far our of whack that something had to be done. He thinks the president has made a good start on driving home his message: \"I thought the (Ossawatomie) Kansas speech led it off well when he talked about the deck being stacked against middle-class Americans for the last ten years. \"I do think the Democrats and Obama have to understand that they've got to make this contrast between the Romney approach and style and policies and the Obama approach and style and policies really clear to people. Because the negatives are just going to be wicked. Romney will turn his fire from Santorum to Obama real fast and these guys (Republican campaign operatives) know what they're doing.\" As for the Republican charges that, among other things, Obama was engaging in class warfare with the Buffett Rule, Fenn pointed to a video from 1985 featuring President Ronald Reagan that's been on the progressive ThinkProgress.org site. In the video made during an official White House event in Michigan, Reagan talked of the unfairness of the tax code by describing a letter he received from a businessman who complained about the unfairness of his paying taxes at a higher rate than his secretary. Sound familiar? \"It was the Buffet Rule. Reagan was railing against this (tax code disparity) ... My point on this is Ronald Reagan wasn't exactly known as a class warrior according to these current Sean Hannity types. But he got it.\" For their part, Republicans clearly intend to use the Buffett Rule debate to cast Obama as just another tax-and-spend Democrat. That was evident from a statement Monday from Romney's campaign: \"President Obama is the first president in history to openly campaign for re-election on a platform of higher taxes... Meanwhile, not everyone is convinced that the polls that suggest a majority of voters want the rich to payer higher taxes show a complete picture. Ed Goeas, a Republican pollster who heads the Tarrance Group, says its not surprising that polls show many voters wanting higher taxes on the wealthy. \"Certainly, it's always easier to say the rich ought to pay more.\" But when he has done focus groups and asked voters what a fair rate would be, it turns out that it's either less or what the wealthy already pay if you add federal and state taxes. GOEAS: \"The more important thing that I always get from focus groups, I will take it to focus groups and say 'OK, the rich need to pay more, what do you think is a fair amount?' \"And consistently I get somewhere in the 20s maybe combined with what they have to pay for the state, 30 percent would be their fair share. And when you look at it the effective tax rate for people on income tax is 30 percent. So for all the stories about the rich not paying, or millionaires not paying, the fact of the matter is when you average all that out, that higher percent whether you're talking about the highest one percent or two percent of those making over $250,000 or we're talking about millionaires, they're paying that 30 percent that seems more than fair (to many voters.) Likewise, when he uses his explanation of capital gains taxes as taxes on money that was already taxed, since investments are often made with previously taxed profits or income, support increases for the lower capital gains tax rate. GOEAS: \"I think quite frankly Romney missed an opportunity when it came out about what he was paying since most of his money he is paying is in that capital gains tax rate for him to say... 'I started a business. I worked hard. I created jobs. I created a profit. I paid my fair share of taxes. And then I took those profits and I didn't hide it in a mattress, I put it to work investing in America, investing in American jobs and other businesses.' \"",

            "article_content": "Mitt Romney is closer to winning the GOP presidential nomination after primary victories this week in Wisconsin, Maryland and Washington, D.C. Halfway through the GOP nominating season, Romney's attacks on President Obama are intensifying.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: It's MORNING EDITION, from NPR News. Good morning. I'm Steve Inskeep. RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: And I'm Renee Montagne. Time and again this election season, Mitt Romney has made a basic maneuver: He's attempted to show he will be the Republican presidential nominee by acting like he already is. Results of early primaries repeatedly proved otherwise, but after three wins on Tuesday and a growing lead in convention delegates, Romney's campaign is aiming at the general election. Here's NPR's Ari Shapiro. ARI SHAPIRO, BYLINE: Mitt Romney has always tried to present himself as a general election kind of guy. From the earliest days of the campaign, he talked about President Obama at every turn. Three months ago, Romney mentioned the president less than a minute into his New Hampshire victory speech. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) (SOUNDBITE OF CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) SHAPIRO: But things didn't go the way the campaign expected. The other Republicans, who Romney always treated as minor bumps in his path to the nomination, became full-fledged roadblocks. Romney had to plunge into the primary mosh pit. Campaigning in Florida, Newt Gingrich became the first person Romney would talk about. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) SHAPIRO: Romney and his superPACs spent millions of dollars in state after state to suppress Newt Gingrich, and then Rick Santorum. It wasn't pretty. Everybody's favorability ratings dropped. But it worked. And for the last month or two, Romney has been back in Obama-centric mode on the stump nearly all the time. That can make it hard to discern a shift to general election rhetoric. Mark McKinnon, who advised President George W. Bush and John McCain, suggests one signpost to look out for. MARK MCKINNON: I think we'll know when he starts talking about a different kind of immigration plan, when he talks about reaching out to Hispanics in a way that's immigrant friendly. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) SHAPIRO: This was Romney speaking in Milwaukee this week. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) SHAPIRO: Political scientist Terry Madonna of Franklin and Marshall College in Pennsylvania suggests a different general election indicator. TERRY MADONNA: It wouldn't surprise me if he now begins to talk about the middle class more - people who have been suffering through the course of this recession. SHAPIRO: As if on cue, this line popped up in Romney's Wisconsin victory speech Tuesday night. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) SHAPIRO: And Romney's attacks against President Obama are intensifying, too. He spoke to a gathering of news executives yesterday in Washington, D.C. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) SHAPIRO: So, why pivot now? Well, part of it has to do with the delegate math. It has become nearly impossible for any other Republican to close the gap with Romney. But there's more to it than that, says Professor Madonna. MADONNA: The president and the Democrats fully understand that Romney is the nominee, and they are beginning to campaign against him. Romney understands that it's in his interest now to avoid talking about his Republican rivals and to focus on the economy and to focus on the president. So, game on. SHAPIRO: This week, the Democrats dragged Romney into the general election, ready or not. The Obama campaign released its first ad targeting Romney. And President Obama publicly went after Romney by name for the first time on Tuesday, accusing him of supporting a budget that would undermine the middle class. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) SHAPIRO: In the last few election cycles, this shift happened earlier for Republicans.  John McCain basically sewed up the nomination in February of 2008.  George W. Bush was an early closer, too. So now Romney needs to make up for lost time and money, because as rough as he found it to beat Rick Santorum and the other Republicans, the fight against President Obama will be much harder.

            "article_content": "President Obama signaled the opening of the general election campaign on Tuesday in a blistering speech before the American Society of News Editors. On Wednesday, Obama's likely rival in the fall \u2014 former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney \u2014 delivered an address before the same group.  AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Audie Cornish. ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: And I'm Robert Siegel. In Washington at least, the 2012 battle for the White House is down to a two-man race. President Obama acknowledged as much yesterday, even before Mitt Romney's latest primary wins. The president attacked Romney in a speech to the American Society of News Editors. Today it was Romney's turn to address the same group. As NPR's Scott Horsley reports, Romney struck back, accusing the president of pushing an anti-business agenda. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Romney's speech to the news editors was less of a departure than the president's. Up until this week, Mr. Obama had been reluctant to single out and elevate any of his Republican opponents. Romney, on the other hand, has been eager to jump ahead to the general election, leaving behind the months of scrimmaging with his primary rivals. Now that his claim to the GOP nomination is all but certain, Romney returned to his original campaign target. Mr. Obama didn't cause the recession, he said, but he's delayed the recovery and made it weaker than it might have been. MITT ROMNEY: I know some will say, but the economy's getting better. Yeah, three and a half years after the stimulus. HORSLEY: Romney argued that administration policies from healthcare to Wall Street reform have discouraged economic growth, and he accused Mr. Obama of delegating the stimulus act to congressional Democrats, turning what should have been a jobs program into the mother of all earmarks. ROMNEY: This administration thinks that our economy is struggling because the stimulus was too small. The truth is, we're struggling because our government has grown too big. As president, I'll get the government out of the way and unleash the power of American enterprise and the innovation of the American people. HORSLEY: Romney promised to do that with lower taxes, reduced regulation and increased energy exploration. Mr. Obama had tried to preempt much of that argument in his own speech yesterday, saying Romney's plan is just a rerun of trickle-down economics. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: The problem for advocates of this theory is that we've tried their approach on a massive scale. The results of their experiment are there for all to see. HORSLEY: The White House notes that employment and income growth were much stronger in the 1990s when tax rates were higher than in the ensuing decade of George Bush's tax cuts. Romney accused the president of campaigning against straw men, and in fact both he and Mr. Obama devoted much of their speeches to countering the caricatures created by their opponents. For his part, Romney insisted he's not some radical zealot campaigning for unfettered capitalism. ROMNEY: Now, I'm not na\u00c3\u00afve enough to believe that free enterprise is the solution to all of our problems. HORSLEY: And Mr. Obama denied the opposite charge, that he's trying to build a government-centric society. OBAMA: I have never been somebody who believes that government can or should try to solve every problem. HORSLEY: At the same time, Mr. Obama argued government should do for the country what people can't do on their own, and he tried to align himself with past Republican presidents who championed government investments in railroads, interstate highways and land-grant colleges. OBAMA: These investments benefit us all. They contribute to genuine, durable economic growth. HORSLEY: Romney acknowledged a legitimate, though limited, role for government regulation and for what he called fair taxation. But he suggested the best way to improve living standards is to improve conditions for business. ROMNEY: Making business thrive in America is one good way of getting people great jobs and rising incomes and growing the middle class. HORSLEY: Romney said while he has not personally lobbied his Republican rivals to get out of the race, he does hope the primary contest ends quickly. That way, he can focus on raising money and campaigning in battleground states, arming himself for what he promised will be a defining election in November. ROMNEY: President Obama and I have very different visions for America, both of what it means to be an American today and what it will mean in the future. HORSLEY: That's one Romney proposition even the president would agree with. Scott Horsley, NPR News, Washington. Copyright \u00a9 2012 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "Incumbent presidents generally try to cast their re-election contest as a choice between the imperfect but well-meaning and effective occupant of the White House and the far worse alternative offered by the rival party. Challengers, on the other hand, try to frame a presidential race as a referendum on the sitting president whose record nearly always contains missteps, or who can be blamed for trouble in the economy or elsewhere. In short, whether it's the president or the challenger, the way the game is played requires each to define the opposition as well as himself. And in speeches both President Obama and the likely Republican nominee, Mitt Romney, gave Tuesday, a day that may have been a pivotal day in the 2012 election, both men were hard at work trying to define the other as in one way or another disconnected from the reality of ordinary Americans and from the arc of U.S. history. Tuesday was probably pivotal because, with Romney's wins in Wisconsin, Maryland and Washington, D.C. primaries, the contest for the GOP presidential nomination really appears to be settled and the general-election campaign begun, according to many analysts. For his part Obama, in his Tuesday speech to news executives, painted Romney as being in the thrall of the discredited economic notion of trickle-down economics as well as a radical House Republican budget that would eviscerate domestic spending programs that help the middle class in order to give the superwealthy more tax breaks. (Romney spoke to the same news executives' group Wednesday.) Obama also tried to reinforce the idea that Romney is a very wealthy man lacking the common touch by jabbing the former Massachusetts governor for using the word \"marvelous\" to describe the House Republican budget. \"It's a word you don't often hear generally,\" Obama said. Meanwhile Romney, in the victory speech that followed his sweep of the Wisconsin, Maryland and Washington, D.C. primaries, portrayed the president as believing that government knows best. Romney even went back to the president's days as a community organizer to try and buttress his charge against the president: \"When he was a community organizer and communities were hurt by plant closings, his reaction was to turn to the government for help. He saw free enterprise as the villain and government as the solution.\" Romney accused the president of being disconnected from reality because of the bubble that surrounds a president, of \"flying around on Air Force One, surrounded by an adoring staff of true believers\" which has left the president \"out of touch.\" While both men worked to define the way they hoped those voters who are in play would see the other party's presidential nominee, they also worked on defining themselves. In an argument the president has made repeatedly in the past and will make continuously into the future it is he, not his Republican rivals, whose governing philosophy embodies the type of American values that have created the nation that became an economic and military superpower. Worth noting is that he, too, raised his experience as a community organizer though to make a point that was exactly opposite of Romney's attack: \"Keep in mind, I have never been somebody who believes that government can or should try to solve every problem. Some of you know my first job in Chicago was working with a group of Catholic churches that often did more good for the people in their communities than any government program could. In those same communities I saw that no education policy, however well crafted, can take the place of a parent's love and attention. \"As President, I've eliminated dozens of programs that weren't working, and announced over 500 regulatory reforms that will save businesses and taxpayers billions, and put annual domestic spending on a path to become the smallest share of the economy since Dwight Eisenhower held this office \u2014 since before I was born. I know that the true engine of job creation in this country is the private sector, not Washington, which is why I've cut taxes for small business owners 17 times over the last three years. \"So I believe deeply that the free market is the greatest force for economic progress in human history. My mother and the grandparents who raised me instilled the values of self-reliance and personal responsibility that remain the cornerstone of the American idea. But I also share the belief of our first Republican President, Abraham Lincoln \u2014 a belief that, through government, we should do together what we cannot do as well for ourselves.\" Romney attempt at self-definition Tuesday night was as someone seeking to return America to a lost past, as a candidate more in tune than Obama with what made the U.S. the world's indispensable nation in the 20th and early 21st centuries: \"I don't want to transform America. I want to restore to America the economic values of freedom and opportunity and limited government that has made us the powerhouse of the world. \"It's opportunity. It's opportunity, not a check from government \u2014 it's opportunity that has always driven America and defined us as Americans. Now I am not naive enough to believe that free enterprise is a solution to all of our problems. But nor am I naive enough to doubt that it is one of the greatest forces for good this world has ever known. \"Free enterprise has done more to lift people out of poverty, to help build a strong middle class, to help educate our kids, and to make our lives better than all the programs of government combined.\" In a speech to news media executives Wednesday, Romney went further in defining himself and the president than he did Tuesday evening. Romney offered himself as a successful businessman and former governor who has proven himself as a problem solver. He described the president, by contrast, as flip flopping on one position after another, taking one stance as president, another as an incumbent seeking re-election. And he accused Obama of having a \"hide and seek campaign\", using an example Obama's inadvertently public open-mic comments to Russian President Dmitri Medvedev that after re-election, he would have more flexibility on European missile-defense negotiations. Now that the Republican primary contest appears to be, once and for all, petering out, the race is on for the president and Romney to see whose definition of the other and himself will most fire up his base while demoralizing the other side and moving those voters who are truly persuadable into his corner.",

            "article_content": "The Republican presidential candidates campaigned in Wisconsin over the weekend. Wisconsin along with Maryland and Washington, D.C. have primaries Tuesday. Mitt Romney is expected to win in Wisconsin.  DAVID GREENE, HOST: It's MORNING EDITION, from NPR News. Good morning. I'm David Greene. You know the drill: another week, another batch of Republican primaries. This Tuesday, it's Maryland, Washington, D.C. and Wisconsin taking their turns. Despite the three venues, all four GOP contenders campaigned exclusively in Wisconsin over the weekend. Mitt Romney is ahead in the polls there, and there is a growing sense that a Romney victory could doom Rick Santorum's sputtering campaign and finally confirm Romney as the GOP's presumptive nominee. NPR's David Welna was with both Santorum and Romney yesterday, and he filed this report. DAVID WELNA, BYLINE: Mitt Romney had good reason to feel fired up yesterday. A couple of days earlier, he'd won the key endorsement of Paul Ryan, the influential House Republican Budget Committee chairman from Janesville, Wisconsin. Then yesterday, another big Wisconsin endorsement came from Tea Party-backed freshman Senator Ron Johnson. He and Ryan showed up in Milwaukee yesterday to campaign with Romney, and they led the candidate into what he thought was a ballroom full of supporters. UNIDENTIFIED GROUP: April fools! (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER) WELNA: In fact, just a few of Romney's staffers were in the ballroom to document his surprise at the April Fool's Day prank. But after a lunch that included fried cheese curds, Romney did face a real overflow crowd at a hotel just outside Madison. He did not even mention his remaining three rivals in the Republican primary. Instead, he aimed his rhetoric at President Obama and cast himself as on track for his party's nomination. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) MITT ROMNEY: This president can't run on his record, and so he's going to try in every way he can to divert to some other kind of attack and try and have people disqualify our nominee, which will probably be me. WELNA: Romney also took on the vice president. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) ROMNEY: Did you hear Vice President Biden yesterday? He's out saying we need a new global tax. I don't know who he's planning on taxing with this, but I know -but he is the gift that keeps on giving, Vice President Biden. There's no doubt about that. WELNA: That comment followed an appearance by Biden yesterday morning on CBS' \"Face the Nation.\" Romney, he said, did not seem to understand what middle class people are concerned about. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"FACE THE NATION\") VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: I think that - I think Governor Romney's a little out of touch. Look, you know, everything that he said the American people don't think the policies have worked. WELNA: But some of those who turned out to hear Romney yesterday said he actually managed to connect with them. Bill Rockwell is an independent who can vote in Wisconsin's open primary, and he says he may vote for Romney. BILL ROCKWELL: Today, I think I was a little more convinced that he's actually a real person, that he isn't this monster-rich guy who nobody can relate to, and he can't relate to anybody else. So... WELNA: But he didn't close the deal with you, apparently. ROCKWELL: Well, I think he came closer to it. WELNA: Eighty-three-year-old Nancy Works says she's voting for Romney because he's electable, and Santorum is not. NANCY WORKS: I am a conservative, but Santorum is too far to the right to bring in independent voters and the RINOs, Republican-in-name-only types. And I think we need every vote we can get. (SOUNDBITE OF BOWLING BALLS HITTING PINS) WELNA: At the Pla-Mor bowling alley in Chilton, Wisconsin, Rick Santorum was once again trying his luck with the 10-pins. Asked how he was feeling about tomorrow's primary here, he replied: Great. RICK SANTORUM: We're having a wonderful time and feel a lot of energy and excitement out here, and we're just hustling as hard as we can. WELNA: And how crucial is winning in Wisconsin? SANTORUM: Every place you compete is crucial, so we're - you know, we're working hard at it. WELNA: And you're staying in the race? (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER) SANTORUM: I'm here. WELNA: But not for long. Santorum plans to leave Wisconsin before tomorrow's primary, just as he's left other states early where polls foretold a loss. Meanwhile, the Republican establishment is quickly closing ranks around Romney. Here's Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell yesterday on CNN's \"State of the Union.\" (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"STATE OF THE UNION\") SENATOR MITCH MCCONNELL: It seems to me that we're in the final phases of wrapping up this nomination. And most of the members of the Senate Republican Conference are either supporting him, or they have the view that I do, that it's time to turn our attention to the fall campaign and begin to make the case against the president of the United States.

It's another furious dash to the finish line as delegate-rich Illinois holds its Republican presidential primary Tuesday. Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney is looking to increase his delegate lead. And he's still searching for that decisive win over his main rival, former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum. While polls show Romney with a slight lead in Illinois, it's far from a sure thing. Sensing an opportunity to put some distance between himself and Santorum, Romney is doubling down in Illinois, where 54 of the state's 69 delegates are at stake. Romney is staying in the state through Tuesday's vote and added more stops than originally planned. In campaigning Sunday and Monday, Romney focused his attack on President Obama while touting his own business acumen. \"You see if you're in business, you have no choice but to be a fiscal conservative,\" Romney told an overflowing crowd at a town hall meeting in the Chicago suburb of  Vernon Hills. \"If you spend more money than you take in, you go broke. You know, I learned that for 25 years, all right, so I understand how it works.\" And Romney poked fun at the massive state budget deficit in the president's home state. Obama \"was a legislator in Illinois, where I understand if you don't spend more money than you take in, you don't get re-elected, right?\" Romney said. He also took swipes at both Obama and his GOP rivals, saying, \"I didn't  learn about the economy in a subcommittee of Congress.  I learned about the  economy on the streets of American business, in the free marketplace and trading  around the world,\" before adding, \"You can't replace an economy lightweight with  another economy lightweight.\" \"We were undecided until today and I would say that after hearing Gov. Romney today, our decision has been made that, yeah, he will get our vote,\" said Connie Gustafson, 28, who attended a Romney rally in Rockford on Sunday with her husband, Carl. But some Illinois Republican primary voters aren't buying Romney's message that he's better tested than the others in the real-world economy. \"I would like to put somebody in office who's had to work for a living,\" said Karen Mack, 45, of Wheaton. \"The idea that politicians are wealthy and have lost touch with middle class and what the real issues are is disheartening.\" In the rest of Illinois, beyond Chicago and its suburbs, where Republican primary voters tend to be more socially conservative, many still question Romney's conservative credentials. in Dixon, the boyhood home of Ronald Reagan, Aaron Wiles turned out to hear Santorum speak next to a statue of the 40th president. Standing in front of a statue of Ronald Reagan on horseback, Rick Santorum speaks at a campaign rally Monday in Dixon, Ill. \n                \n                    \n                    Seth Perlman/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Standing in front of a statue of Ronald Reagan on horseback, Rick Santorum speaks at a campaign rally Monday in Dixon, Ill. \"I'm looking for somebody who I think is the true conservative in the race and I have serious hesitations with Mitt Romney's front-runner status,\" said Wiles. \"And I do believe that Rick [Santorum] has been the conservative from Day 1 ever since he's been in the Senate.\" And that's the message Santorum himself tried to hammer home to Illinois voters. \"Let's just be brutally honest about it: There's one candidate in this race who can never make this race about freedom, because he simply abandoned freedom when he was governor of Massachusetts and he abandoned it when he promoted Obamacare in 2009,\" said Santorum. Santorum has been drawing huge crowds and is hoping strong turnout downstate can offset the more moderate Chicago suburbs. \"The wheels on the Romney bike are a little wobbly now,\" said Matt Streb, a political scientist at Northern Illinois University. \"I think if he loses Illinois, one of them probably falls off.\" While Illinois is a  usually a blue state in general elections, \"The Republican Party is not nearly  as moderate in Illinois as I think most people make it out to be,\" Streb said,  adding that GOP primary voters have been voting more conservative in recent  years. That could bode well for Santorum. As for Romney, a  decisive win in a large state such as Illinois would certainly go a long way toward  helping Romney get closer to the nomination, said Streb, but it's not  critical. \"We are getting to  the point though, where kind of momentum becomes less important and, now,  delegate count does matter,\" said Streb. And that's where  Santorum could come up short in Illinois. Even if he is able to win the  popular vote, Santorum was unable to field full slates of delegates in every  Illinois  congressional district. The Chicago Tribune explained: \"Romney, [Newt] Gingrich and [Ron] Paul fielded full slates of 54 delegates in the state's 18 congressional districts. Santorum failed to file delegates in four districts, including the new 5th District that takes in eastern DuPage County and the 13th District that features several Republican-leaning areas in central Illinois.\"",

            "article_content": "1 of 12 Mitt Romney gave a major  economic speech Friday, in which he stressed his plan to lower personal income  taxes. Romney's own taxes became an  issue last month, when he acknowledged paying a lower tax rate than many  middle-class families. Friday's speech came in  Detroit, where Romney's father made his fortune  as an auto executive, before going on to serve as Michigan's governor.  In  1967, during his own run for the White House, George Romney released more than a  decade's worth of tax returns. And in the lead-up to the  South Carolina  primary, pressure built on Mitt Romney to live up to his father's  example. \"[George Romney] released them for not  one year, but for 12 years. And when he did that he said this: 'One year could be  a fluke, perhaps done for show.' When you release yours, will you follow your  father's example?\" asked CNN debate moderator John  King. Romney's reply:  \"Maybe.\" Ultimately, Mitt Romney  released just one year's return, 2010, as well as an estimate for 2011.  His  effective tax rate was just below 15 percent. Both George and Mitt Romney  gave significant sums to charity, a large share of it to the Mormon church. Charitable donations are tax deductible, which helped bring down the tax burdens  of both father and son. George  Romney 1955-1966 Total charitable contributions: $675,813, representing 22 percent of his adjusted gross income over that  time Mitt  Romney 2010 and 2011  (estimated) Total charitable  contributions: $7,004,546, representing 16.5 percent of his adjusted gross income over  that time  George Romney's returns tell  a different story.  His tax rate most years was two to three times that of his son. It topped 44 percent in 1963.  That's the year the elder Romney was sworn in as Michigan's  governor. Big Shift In The Top  Marginal Tax Rate One big change between  George Romney's time and our own is the top marginal tax rate.  If you think tax  rates are high today, think again \u2014 they were a lot higher in the 1950s and  '60s. The top marginal tax rate in  1955, the first year of George Romney's public returns, was 91 percent.  Tax relief came  along under Lyndon Johnson, but the top tax rate remained a whopping 70  percent. \"Definitely the 1960s were a  different time than today,\" says Joseph Thorndike, director of the Tax History  Project at Tax Analysts. \"People were more comfortable with higher rates than we  are today.\" That comfort level would  soon change, though, and for the next 20 years, the top income tax rate moved in  one direction: down. \"It comes down to 50 percent  in the 1970s,\" says Thorndike. \"And then it drops down even further in sort of  the mid '80s under Ronald Reagan to 28 percent.\" A Preference For Capital  Gains But there were a lot of  trade-offs to achieve this lower rate under Reagan. While taxes on ordinary  income went down, taxes on investment income, like capital gains, went up.  For  the first time in modern history, money made for working and investing was  treated equally.  But it didn't last. \"Essentially since the  beginning of the income tax there's been a preference for capital-gains income,\"  explains Thorndike. \"That's partly because economists thought it was a good  idea. It's partly because politicians thought it was a good  idea.\" Bill Clinton restored the  tax advantage for investment income, and George W. Bush made it bigger.  Today,  qualified dividends and capital gains are taxed at just 15 percent, less than  half the top tax rate for ordinary income. Source: Citizens For Tax Justice Credit: Alyson Hurt/NPR That's a big windfall for those  like Mitt Romney, who make most of their money from investments. In 2010, nearly  three-quarters of Romney's $21 million income was taxed at the lower capital-gains rate \u2014 a tax rate he defended at  last month's CNN debate in South  Carolina. \"I'm not going to apologize  for being successful,\" said Romney. George Romney also  benefited from the tax discount on capital gains, especially in years like  1960, when his investment income neared $500,000.  The elder Romney earned most  of his fortune as head of American Motors  Corp. His son Mitt followed  a different course. \"I could have stayed in  Detroit like him  and gotten pulled up in the car company,\" Romney said during the CNN debate. \"I  went off on my own.\" The younger Romney made his  money buying and selling companies for a private equity firm, Bain Capital.  And  that's another generational change.  Finance, not industry, now dominates the  U.S. economy, accounting for as much as  40 percent of all corporate profits. \"If you look at where smart  young graduates from top schools want to go to work, a lot of it is in and around  the financial sector,\" says economist Simon Johnson of MIT, who documents the  change in his book 13 Bankers.   \"You hear some but not a lot of people  saying they want to go work in manufacturing.  But finance is still a huge draw  for talent.\" And those who do go into  finance, like Mitt Romney, not only can make more money than their forebears in  manufacturing, but they're able to keep more thanks to the design of the American  tax code. George Romney released 12 years of tax returns in his 1967 run for president. He benefited from a lower capital-gains-tax rate but paid a far higher rate than his son overall. Romney's tax data first appeared in a 1967 article in Look magazine. Source: Tax Notes, Jan. 16, 2012",

Manufacturing is as American as motherhood, baseball and apple pie. Who could be against Americans making more of what they consume and exporting more to the rest of the world? Which is why President Obama was hardly taking a political risk Wednesday by going to a Master Lock factory in Milwaukee and extolling the company for repatriating manufacturing jobs from China. \"Today you're selling products directly to customers in China, stamped  with those words \"Made in America.\"  (Cheers, applause.)  And the good  news is, this is starting to happen around the country.  For the first  time since 1990s, American manufacturers are creating new jobs.  That's  good for the companies, but it's also good up and down the supply chain,  because if you're making this stuff here, that means that there are  producers and suppliers in and around the area who have a better chance  of selling stuff here.  It means the restaurant close by suddenly has  more customers. Everybody benefits when manufacturing is going strong. That's music to the ears of many voters in swing states with large populations of blue-collar workers and sizable manufacturing sectors, like Wisconsin, Ohio and Michigan, for instance. Obama has proposed using the tax code to place incentives in front of manufacturers that create factory jobs in the U.S. rather than abroad. Rick Santorum, who is running for the Republican presidential nomination, has also proposed tax-based incentives for manufacturers. But it's worth noting that some economists see risks in politicians and other policymakers focusing so much on manufacturing. As Scott Horsley reported on Morning Edition Wednesday, one of those skeptics is Christina Roemer who for a while headed Obama's Council of Economic Advisers. An excerpt from Scott's report: SCOTT: ... \"Romer... says since factory jobs are no longer a gateway for unskilled workers to the middle class, they may not deserve special treatment from the government. CHRISTINA ROMER: \"I don't think any of us know sort of what the future of the American economy is. I think we have to be careful not to hold onto sort of this idea that it was good in the past. It must be, you know, what's going to be good in the future.\" That view was seconded and expanded on by Jeffrey Bergstrand, an economist at the University of Notre Dame, said in a comment distributed by the university. Of what is being called \"factory nostalgia\" by some, he said: \"It's an understandable  sentiment, but probably not a realist(ic) economic plan. Further, the future of  manufacturing in America is far different from the heavy, assembly-line  operations of the past, and this has vast implications for the country's  worsening education gap. \"The romance  associated with it is actually economically legitimate because it reminds us of  the period of the greatest growth that we had in the U.S. economy which is  basically 1950 to 1973, that 23 year period. \"And that was a period where we had  the fastest growth and real income, something we have not seen for the last now  40 years.  It's also, at the same time, an association with the boom in the  middle class.. \"... What I see it as is a slowing down of the rate of loss of (U.S.) manufacturing, almost  a stabilization of the decline of manufacturing in this country. The last 25  years, 30 years, companies would be heavily going into China because it was much  less costly in labor to produce product, plus this is an enormous market, so it  simply made sense. But the subsequent (per) capita income growth has meant a rise in  the relative price of their labor, and so the differential has been alleviated. \"Once that differential alleviates and diminishes, the rate of manufacturing  decline has to slow down... \"... We still will likely have  for the foreseeable future much value added created by high technology  manufacturing... By high technology,' I mean basically the research and  development is done here, the branding is done here, the high value added end of  manufacturing, high technology manufacturing is done here. \"There's a significant  problem associated with that, though, which is that the widening gap in  educational access in this country is a very serious problem for us to maintain  our lead or our status in high technology in manufacturing.  That gap in  education is more serious for high technology manufacturing than it is for  services.  And that's a serious problem we're facing...\"",

            "article_content": "Ever since Congress passed the Food Stamp Act nearly a half century ago, that federal hunger-relief program has periodically become a political target. Over the past decade, the nation's food stamp program has more than doubled in size. This year, the program has become a part of the presidential contest.  RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: Here's something that's functioning as a hot button this campaign season - food stamps. Last week in Nevada, Newt Gingrich not only blamed President Obama for a huge expansion of the federal hunger relief program, but also Gingrich's chief Republican rival as well. NEWT GINGRICH: We now know from Governor Romney, he joins Obama. Obama is big food stamp. He's little food stamp, but they're both - they both think food stamps are OK. MONTAGNE: The food stamp program has more than doubled in size over the past decade. Here's NPR's David Welna on how it's also become a part of this year's presidential contest. DAVID WELNA, BYLINE: Newt Gingrich took his presidential campaign to Cincinnati, Ohio yesterday. And just as he has nearly everywhere else he's been in the past eight months, Gingrich once again invoked food stamps to blast President Obama. GINGRICH: That's why I've said over and over again this is the best food stamp president in American history. (SOUNDBITE OF CHEERING) WELNA: It's a charge the Obama administration is not leaving unanswered. On Monday at a fundraiser in Tallahassee, Vice President Joe Biden called out Gingrich and his supporters. VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: These are the same guys calling the president a, you know, a food stamp president - a thinly veiled - I don't know what it is, but it's inappropriate. It's inappropriate. WELNA: Some in the crowd went further, calling the food stamp label racist. But for Gingrich, calling Mr. Obama the food stamp president has proven a reliable applause line. Nowhere was this more the case than at the rowdy Fox News debate last month in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. GINGRICH: The fact is that more people have been put on food stamps by Barack Obama than any president in American history. (SOUNDBITE OF CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WELNA: President Obama responded directly in an interview with ABC's Diane Sawyer late last month. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: First of all, I don't put people on food stamps. People become eligible for food stamps.  Second of all, the initial expansion of food-stamp eligibility happened under my Republican predecessor, not under me. WELNA: In fact, according to Department of Agriculture records, a half million more people were added to the food stamp program under President George W. Bush than the 14.2 million people added during the Obama presidency. In all, more than 46 million people - or one out of seven in the general population - now receive food stamp assistance. The most recent reports show that number actually began to decline last fall. That has not been the case everywhere, however. Early morning Monday, several dozen people are already waiting for help at the county income support center in Silver Spring, Maryland. Laura Couchman is the lead social worker there. LAURA COUCHMAN: We've had a lot of new people, people who never thought they'd be here, and we've heard that quite a few times, I never thought I'd see the inside of these doors. WELNA: One of them is a woman who's just come in. KISHA CASTILLO: My name's Kisha Castillo, I'm 28, and I do have a job, but currently I'm on maternity leave. WELNA: Castillo has three small children; their father, she says, is a construction worker who's hasn't had a job in almost three years. After leaving her own job a month ago as a hospital secretary to go on maternity leave, she realized she would have to ask for food stamps. CASTILLO: It's hard, because you know, you have your pride and, you know, like I said, I'm, I do work but, you know, it's hard for me to kind of suck up my pride and say I need help, but I need help. WELNA: And what does she think of Gingrich calling Mr. Obama the food stamp president? CASTILLO: I don't think that's nice. (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER) CASTILLO: I mean he's trying his best to help the people; he's trying his best to help everybody, you know, to get back on their feet. Everybody doesn't have it, you know, we're all not high class. We're - you know, even we're all not middle class. WELNA: In fact, about two of every five food stamp recipients live in a household where someone does have a job. Jim Weill heads the Washington-based Food Research and Action Center. JIM WEILL: It's not just people who've been unemployed, or who've been unemployed and for a year or two, it's people who are working at minimum wage and have one or two kids, it's parents who can only get part-time work. WELNA: Weill cites a recent national survey that found more than three quarters of Americans of all political stripes support the food stamp program. Still, Alabama Republican Senator Jeff Sessions thinks Gingrich is right to make food stamps an issue. SENATOR JEFF SESSIONS: I think it's a policy of the administration, just get money out of the door to try to stimulate the economy, and not look closely at who's getting it and why they're getting it. WELNA: Per capita, Sessions' Alabama is one of the top food stamp recipients in the nation; so is Louisiana. But that state's Democratic Senator, Mary Landrieu, calls Gingrich's food stamps charges unfair. SENATOR MARY LANDRIEU: It is blaming the victim, and it's making a mockery of some of the most important, I think, social safety net programs in the country. WELNA: If the aim is to go after government freeloaders, Landrieu adds, take away the special tax loopholes for the rich. David Welna, NPR News, the Capitol.

The state holds its caucus Saturday.\n                \n                    \n                    Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Romney supporters gather for a rally at the Elko Regional Airport in Nevada on Friday. The state holds its caucus Saturday. Saturday is caucus day in Nevada, the first state in the West to vote as Republicans go about choosing their presidential candidate. Mitt Romney is counting on another win here to keep him on the path to the nomination. Newt Gingrich and Ron Paul have also been campaigning across the state, while Rick Santorum is in the Midwest looking ahead to later contests next week. Believe it or not, Nevada leads the country in unemployment, home foreclosures and bankruptcy. But at Romney's rally in Elko on Friday, the stories were vastly different. In Elko, there are not enough houses for everyone who wants to buy. \"My wife sells real estate, and they're having a hard time finding houses for people,\" says Jim Moore, who works for the Federal Aviation Administration. Elko is a gold-mining boomtown. Michael Cornell works underground in the mines. \"We've been relatively untouched. I make six figures a year, and many of us here do,\" he says. \"We've had a lot of people come from other parts of the country to live here because of the jobs situation.\" That's really different from a lot of Nevada. \"I hear that there's some sort of unemployment rate problem here in Nevada, and we don't see any of it here,\" Cornell says. Romney Shifts Focus To Obama Romney's visit Friday coincides with the National Cowboy Poetry Gathering. \"The heart of the cowboy, the love of freedom and the outdoors and nature being celebrated this week with cowboy poetry,\" he said. \"Congratulations to you that have come to listen to some wise words from some very humorous and bright people.\" A week ago in Florida, Romney was hammering Gingrich incessantly. But ever since his decisive win in that state, he has kept his sights trained solely on President Obama. \"We have a president who is convinced that government is the answer to every challenge we have. Government has an important role, but it's not the answer,\" he said. Romney has been very popular in Nevada, dating back to when he won the state caucuses four years ago. Still, he encounters the same challenges here that he does across the country. Ashley Leahy came to this rally to see what Romney had to say, but she says she just doesn't like him very much. \"I think that he can come across as very abrupt and pompous and very defensive,\" she says. Paul Bets On Loyalty Leahy's planning to vote for Paul, a man who expects to climb in the standings Saturday in a state where loyal support makes a difference. He was out in Las Vegas on Friday, thanking some of those supporters at a \"Gun Owners for Paul\" event. Later, he addressed a group of veterans. \"National defense is the responsibility of the federal government, and, unfortunately, I think we spend too much money overseas doing the wrong thing,\" he said, \"which actually undermines our national defense.\" Paul took second place in the Nevada caucuses last time. Gingrich Vs. 'Obama-Lite' Then there's Gingrich, whose goal here is to knock Romney off the pedestal of inevitability. \"It isn't good enough for the Republican Party to nominate Obama-lite,\" he said Friday. Gingrich rallied voters at a country-western restaurant in Las Vegas, returning to Romney's statement earlier this week that he doesn't care about the \"very poor.\" Romney has said he misspoke and meant to say that his focus is on helping the middle class. Gingrich called the gaffe evidence that Romney's not ready for prime time. \"The elite media did exactly what Obama will do this fall and kept replaying 'I don't really care about the poor,' which by the way is not a very clever thing for somebody who's very wealthy to say,\" Gingrich said. \"Talk about every possible example of what we don't want in a general election candidate.\" Out Of Nevada, In The Race The fourth candidate in the race, Santorum, is not in Nevada. He spent Friday in Missouri battling a cold during a joint appearance with the evangelical leader James Dobson. Dobson asked if Santorum was \"in for the long haul.\" \"Look, a lot of people have come up to me and said ... 'Please stay in the race.' I'm not getting out of the race,\" Santorum said. Having opted out of the Nevada contest early, however, Santorum is not likely to be a factor in the results that come in late Saturday.",

            "article_content": "(Revised at 2:19 pm ET) In an interview Thursday, Mitt Romney said he \"misspoke\" when he infamously said earlier in the week that he was not concerned about the very poor because they had a safety net, and the very rich but, instead, was focused on the middle class. Speaking of the CNN interview that has caused Romney a world of trouble, the Republican presidential frontrunner told Jon Ralston of the Las Vegas Sun during an interview program called Face to Face: \"Jon, it was a misstatement. I misspoke. I've said something that is similar to that but quite acceptable for a long time.  And you know when you do I don't know how many thousands of interviews now and then you may get it wrong. And I misspoke. Plain and simple.\" (Romney's speaks about his controversial statement at the 8:00 mark.) That explanation would make more sense, however, if after his earlier comments caused a firestorm, Romney hadn't told the traveling press corps on his charter jet nearly the exact same thing he said to CNN's Soledad O'Brien. In Romney's airborne attempt to clarify his remarks, he defended his earlier statement CNN statement, essentially repeating it. And he never said that he had earlier misspoken. After Ralston asked him what he really meant to say, Romney said: \"What I said is that my focus, my primary focus, is on helping people get into the middle class and grow the middle class. That we have a safety net that cares for the poor. I want to keep that safety net strong and able. The wealthy are doing just fine. But we really need to focus on the middle-income people in this country. \"And you know what, if people are going to go after me when I make a mistake, whe I slip up on a word I say, even though I say 'I got it wrong. Sorry, that's not what I meant,' that's going to be part of the political process. I understand it and I accept the consequences.\"",

John Larson, a Connecticut Democrat., introduces President Obama at the House Democratic Issues Conference on Friday in Cambridge, Md. President Obama flew out to Maryland's Eastern Shore on Friday to fire up his rank and file in Congress. House Democrats have spent the past few days in their annual retreat, regrouping and strategizing for the year to come. Lawmakers say their hopes for success \u2014 in the economy and in politics \u2014 depend on sticking together and sending the same message to Americans. The head of the House Democratic Caucus, John Larson of Connecticut, whipped up the crowd before Obama's speech. Democrats, he said, came out of the president's State of the Union address this week with a fresh message \"that reignited and energized this caucus, but more importantly the American people. Inspired, we came here to work!\" Lawmakers jumped to their feet, cheering the arrival of the Democrat in chief. Obama recapped many of the themes in his State of the Union speech, stressing manufacturing, bringing outsourced jobs back to the United States and leveling the playing field, he said, for the middle class. \"We are focusing on companies that are investing right here in the United States, because we believe that when you make it in America, everybody benefits, everybody does well,\" he said. The president also talked about the biggest thorn in his side \u2014 the House Republicans. In their year in the majority, the Republicans have tussled with Democrats over even the most basic functions of government. Voters are starting to understand that, Obama said, but that doesn't mean Democrats should stop trying to work with them. \"Wherever we have an opportunity, wherever there is the possibility that the other side is putting some politics aside for just a nanosecond in order to get something done for the American people, we've got to be right there ready to meet them,\" Obama said. Americans are facing too many problems right now to stop trying, the president said. \"On the other hand, where they obstruct, where they're unwilling to act, where they're more interested in party than they are in country, more interested in the next election than the next generation, then we've got to call them out on it,\" Obama said. That's a preview of Democrats' election message: They've done everything they can, they'll say, and Republicans have played politics. Vice President Joe Biden spoke to the lawmakers earlier Friday, wondering out loud how the GOP can expect to govern when \"compromise\" is a dirty word. \"Who do you make a deal with? Who can you reach out and shake hands with and say, 'We have a bargain?' That's the way this country's always functioned,\" Biden said. And as for the Republican presidential hopefuls, Biden said whoever is nominated \u2014 whether it's Newt Gingrich or Mitt Romney or someone else \u2014 he will provide a stark contrast to how the Democrats approach governing. \"When these guys [are] out there saying, 'Let Detroit go bankrupt' or 'Poor people have no habit of working' or ... 'Barack Obama's the food-stamp president,' I think it's not just political theater. I really think they believe it,\" Biden said. And that, said both Biden and Obama, may be an advantage for Democrats this election year. The message they are sending is so very different from the Republicans' message, they said, that come November, the choice voters have will be crystal clear.",

Ron Paul, shown at a campaign stop in South Carolina, spoke with NPR's All Things Considered today about the upcoming primaries, the possibility of a third-party run, taxes and other issues. In a wide-ranging discussion with All Things Considered's Robert Siegel, Ron Paul, the Republican congressman from Texas, said of all the GOP hopefuls, he's been the steady one. \"All I know is that the message is powerful,\" he said in response to a question about the viability of his campaign. \"The message is well-received. Our numbers are growing, and we don't go up and down like a yo-yo.\" Paul has had solid showings in the first three contests of the primary season, but he's the only one of the four candidates left who can't claim a victory. He came in third in Iowa with 21 percent of the vote; second in New Hampshire with 23 percent, and came in fourth in South Carolina with 13 percent of the vote. In Florida, which votes Jan. 31, the latest CNN/Time/ORC poll has him in fourth place with 9 percent support among Republican voters. (Correction at 6 p.m. ET: We mistakenly pointed to a Gallup national poll earlier.) Robert asked him if he could win any of the upcoming states. Paul said he had not made those calculations. Robert also pressed him on whether he would consider a third-party run. Paul, who throughout the campaign has not ruled that out, has worried Republicans because they believe a third-party run could help Democrats in the general election. So Robert asked him if a third-party candidacy would be an honorable thing to take on. \"I think what is honorable is for me to do what I think is right,\" Paul said. Robert also talked plenty of policy with Paul. Here are some of the highlights. -- On what he thinks about Mitt Romney paying a lower interest rate on his income than many middle-class Americans, Paul said he would prefer everyone pay the same tax rate. \"I wouldn't go for equity by raising everybody's taxes to 30 percent. I'd want to lower everybody to 15 percent,\" he said. So, Robert asked, a person who makes $50,000 a year would pay the same as someone who makes $5 million a year? \"I don't like the principle of a graduated income tax. It's reflective of a system which is designed to redistribute wealth,\" he said, adding that it is also an incentive for government corruption. \"Usually it just invites people to use that power to protect their wealth. This is certainly what's happening today in both the monetary system and the way the system is structured in Washington with the powerful special interests. They're able to use those powers to punish the people that they're supposed to protect.\" -- During Monday's debate, Newt Gingrich said he supported Paul's proposal to take the country back to the gold standard. Paul said that Gingrich was probably saying that for political expediency. \"He would have had the chance over all those years to help me out,\" he said. \"I've gotten more help from from [Democratic Rep.] Barney Frank. He helped me get the bill passed in the House to audit the [Federal Reserve]. \"Progressive Democrats are much better in helping sort out and find out what the corporations are doing and what the banks are doing than conservative Republicans.\" -- Paul walked a fine line when talking about civil rights laws. Paul has courted controversy before by saying he would not have voted for the 1964 Civil Rights Act. During the interview with Robert, he made similar arguments saying that he can't imagine anyone in today's world putting up a sign that says they wouldn't serve blacks, for example. \"I mean that is ancient history,\" he told Robert. Paul made the argument that government is the problem, that government was the one that instituted slavery and instituted Jim Crow laws. But when pressed, when asked if Americans would have voluntarily integrated, he admitted, \"Some of those laws were good laws. Some of that was to repeal bad laws.\" For more of Robert's interview with Paul, tune into All Things Considered on your local NPR member station. We'll post the as-aired version of the interview here later today.",

President Obama has been talking in recent weeks about the need to bolster the middle class. With his third State of the Union address Tuesday, he began outlining the policies he believes are necessary to make \"an economy that's built to last.\" In his address to Congress and the nation, Obama outlined several systemic changes to the economy and the tax code. He intends to tax the top earners more heavily, offer tax breaks to businesses that create jobs within the U.S. and improve training and education for American workers. \"We can either settle for a country where a shrinking number of people do really well, while a growing number of Americans barely get by,\" he said, \"or we can restore an economy where everyone gets a fair shot, everyone does their fair share, and everyone plays by the same set of rules.\" Obama opened his address with a reference to his welcoming home some of the last U.S. troops from Iraq. He also mentioned his administration's success in hunting down Osama bin Laden and other members of the terrorist group al-Qaida. But the president devoted the bulk of his address to economic matters. Promoting Manufacturing Obama, who said that the state of the union is \"getting stronger,\" pointed out that job creation is now approaching pre-recession levels, with 3 million jobs created over the past 22 months. He noted the success enjoyed by American carmakers General Motors and Chrysler since they were bailed out and restructured by the federal government. Obama pledged to encourage U.S. manufacturing through changes to the tax code. He proposed blocking tax breaks for companies that send jobs overseas, while calling for all multinational companies to pay \"a basic minimum tax.\" \"No, we will not go back to an economy weakened by outsourcing, bad debt and phony financial profits,\" Obama said. Streamlining Training Obama put an emphasis on steamlining worker training programs and said that higher education had to be made more affordable, calling it \"an economic imperative.\" Obama singled out as an example Jackie Bray, a North Carolina woman who sat during the speech to the immediate right of first lady Michelle Obama. After having been laid off as a mechanic, Bray was trained to work at a gas turbine factory thanks to a partnership between its operator and a local community college. Obama called on Congress to block interest rates on student loans from doubling this summer and wants to create economic penalties for colleges and universities that allow tuition increases to get out of hand. \"You see, an economy built to last is one where we encourage the talent and ingenuity of every person in this country,\" he said. The president touted his record on fossil-fuel production, seeking to stave off criticism from his decision last week to block a permit for an oil pipeline from Canada. Obama has already noted in campaign advertising that America now relies on foreign sources for just under 50 percent of its energy needs for the first time in 13 years. He noted the country's spike in natural gas production. But some Republicans and energy industry officials say that Obama is taking credit for successes that were not of his own making, since his administration has been comparatively stingy about allowing new permits for drilling on public lands and offshore. Obama called for further development of natural gas, but also renewed his call for investments in clean energy sources. A Face For The Buffett Rule On a day when much of the news was dominated by the release of personal income tax returns by Mitt Romney, a former Massachusetts governor who is seeking the GOP presidential nomination, Obama called again on rich Americans to pay a greater share of taxes. Among the guests in the first lady's box was Debbie Bosanek, the secretary of billionaire investor Warren Buffett. Buffett has often said it's unfair that he pays a lower effective tax rate on his investments than his secretary, who earns far less in wages. For the first time, Obama offered a specific number regarding the imposition of a \"Buffett rule,\" calling for wealthy Americans to pay a minimum income tax rate. Those making more than $1 million a year should not pay less than 30 percent in taxes, Obama said. But he pledged to keep tax rates constant for American households earning less than $250,000 annually. Bosanek nodded as the president said, \"Asking a billionaire to pay at least as much as his secretary in taxes \u2014 most Americans would call that common sense.\" The president also called for tighter regulations of financial institutions, saying he would direct Attorney General Eric Holder to work with his state-level counterparts to create a special unit of prosecutors to look into abusive lending practices. A Nod Abroad Obama devoted the bulk of his remarks to energy and the economy, but he did address major changes seen around the globe this past year. He described the \"wave of change\" across the Arab world, noting in particular the ouster and death of longtime Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi. He expressed his belief that Syrian President Bashar Assad will also soon be driven from power, but offered no specifics about what the U.S. might do to achieve such an outcome. Obama also reiterated his determination to keep Iran from building nuclear weapons. Despite recent saber-rattling between the countries, Obama said that a \"peaceful resolution\" is still possible. In addition to offering what he framed as positive remarks about Iraq and al-Qaida, the president said, \"We've begun to wind down the war in Afghanistan.\" The Republican Response In the official GOP response, Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels said that while Obama was not responsible for the recession, he has failed to make the economy better. \"He cannot claim that the last three years have made things anything but worse: the percentage of Americans with a job is at the lowest in decades,\" Daniels said. Echoing complaints raised by other Republicans throughout the day, Daniels said that Obama's agenda relies on excessive government spending. Daniels said the federal debt has to be curbed, in part by reining in entitlements. Raising tax rates on the wealthy, he said, would choke off growth. \"It's not fair and it's not true for the president to attack Republicans in Congress as obstacles on these questions,\" Daniels said. \"They and they alone have passed bills to reduce borrowing, reform entitlements, and encourage new job creation, only to be shot down time and time again by the president and his Democratic Senate allies.\" Obama: Not Backing Down Still, Obama signaled that he would not back down from further fights with Republicans in Congress. Over the next three days, he will be repeating his economic themes on a tour of several states \u2014 Iowa, Arizona and Nevada \u2014 that are likely to be battlegrounds this fall. \"I intend to fight obstruction with action,\" he said, \"and I will oppose any effort to return to the very same policies that brought on this economic crisis in the first place.\" The mere fact that Republicans are responding to Obama's ideas, however, showcases the importance of the State of the Union in helping Obama shape the political agenda. Thus far this year, more attention has been devoted to the GOP primary process. \"This gives him the public forum, the attention that has been so focused on the Republicans vying for the nomination this year,\" says presidential historian Robert Dallek. \"This gives Obama the chance to come back onto center stage.\"",

And to no one's surprise, the former Massachusetts governor, private equity firm exec and GOP presidential contender makes a tidy sum. NPR asked William Gale, co-director of the Brookings Institution's Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center; Alan Viard, a resident scholar who specializes in federal tax and budget policy at the American Enterprise Institute; and Victor Fleischer, a professor of law specializing in tax at the University of Colorado Law School, to comment on the controversy surrounding Romney's income and the taxes he pays. Q: How could Mitt Romney, a millionaire several times over, pay a tax rate lower than many middle-income Americans? Viard: At the higher income range ... how much individual income tax you pay is heavily dependent on whether your income is long-term capital gains and qualified dividends on the one hand, or whether it's so-called ordinary income on the other hand. The statutory rate differential really tells the story; you have a 35 percent statutory rate on income [at the top] and a 15 percent statutory rate on long-term capital gains and qualified dividends. Q: Does the middle class as a group bear the largest portion of the federal tax burden? Gale: It depends on what you call the middle class. People who are in the 95th percentile think of themselves as the middle class. If you think of the middle class as the 30th to 95th percentile, you probably get that answer. Fleischer: The very rich still end up contributing the most in federal income taxes.  After all, they have most of the income, even if it is not always taxed at the highest rate. Q: Why would Romney's effective tax rate be so much lower than other millionaire politicians? Viard: If a person has a large portion of their income from long-term capital gains and qualified dividends, then their individual tax rate is going to be much lower than it would be for someone else in the same income bracket whose income is largely of the ordinary variety. If you look at the upper-income groups, I think there is a great disparity in that regard. The high-income levels are a really heterogeneous group \u2014 there are some whose income comes largely from wages; people in very high-paying jobs such as corporate executives, athletes and entertainers. That's going to be in the 35 percent bracket. Then there are others whose income is almost exclusively in capital gains in dividends and they're going to be getting that 15 percent rate. Fleischer: Mr. Romney's average tax rate is about 14 percent because most of his income comes from something called carried interest.  Carried interest is a percentage of profits that a fund manager receives as compensation for managing someone else's investments. What's unusual about the situation is that Mr. Romney isn't paying a low tax rate because he's sitting on investments that he made \u2014 lots of rich people do that.  He's paying tax at a low rate because his labor income is taxed as if it were capital gain. Gale: [Also] ... clearly Romney gave a significant amount to charitable organizations. Q: Are there other special tax breaks available to someone in the highest income bracket that average Americans would not get? Gale: The two obvious ways are exclusions and deductions. Exclusions never show up on the tax form to begin with. I'm guessing, just guessing, that that's big here. But, we don't know, because by virtue of them not being on the tax form, no information on them is provided when the tax form is released. Fleischer: Carried interest is just one of the tax breaks that some rich people \u2014 in this case investment fund managers \u2014 can take advantage of. Other breaks include large retirement accounts, deferring income offshore, shielding business income in trusts, and avoiding payroll taxes on small-business income.  For Mr. Romney, the biggest tax breaks are carried interest, taxed at 15 percent, and a huge IRA, which defers a lot of his income until later.",

            "article_content": "Mitt Romney released his tax returns for 2010 and 2011, after earlier suggesting he would wait until after winning the Republican nomination. While Romney's total tax bill was in the millions, his tax rate was actually lower than that of many middle-class Americans.  MELISSA BLOCK, HOST: This is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. I'm Melissa Block. ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: And I'm Robert Siegel. We know far more today than we did yesterday about Mitt Romney's money. After much prodding on the campaign trail, Romney released his 2010 tax returns and estimates for 2011. There were few surprises. It's well-known that before he was Massachusetts' governor, Romney made a fortune in the private equity business. BLOCK: What we didn't know is exactly how much money that fortune continues to earn Romney in interest and dividends, or how much tax he pays on it. The answer, he brought in about $21 million a year and his effective tax rate is just under 15 percent. NPR's Tamara Keith reports. TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: All of the tax experts we spoke with say Romney's returns follow the letter of the law. They aren't something you can throw together in a few hours on TurboTax. In fact, his family hires the heavy-hitting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers. Thomas Cooke is a professor of law at Georgetown's Business School. THOMAS COOKE: As a tax professor, it's the type of tax return I rarely get a chance to show to my students. KEITH: The Romney campaign released about 500 pages of tax documents this morning, and Cooke says there are no major surprises. COOKE: It's an example of how one can be extremely wealthy, be in 100 percent compliance with the law, take advantage of every aspect of the tax law that's out there and wind up paying a very, very low effective tax rate. KEITH: Romney's effective tax rate at just below 15 percent is far lower than Newt Gingrich's at 31 percent, and President Obama's at around 25 percent. That's because both Gingrich and Mr. Obama get their most of their income from wages and other sources taxed at a marginal rate of up to 35 percent. Mitt Romney gets almost all of his money from investments, interest and dividends, taxed at the lower 15 percent capital gains rate. LARRY ZELENAK: All you have to do is be, you know, fabulously wealthy, and those are the rules that apply to you. KEITH: Larry Zelenak is a professor at Duke Law School. What stands out to him about the Romney taxes is... ZELENAK: That it's kind of remarkable under current law that an extremely wealthy couple like the Romneys don't have to do anything very aggressive at all in order to get their average tax rate down to around 15 percent. KEITH: There are no special tax tricks or dodges here. The tax code simply favors Romney's kind of income. Roberton Williams is a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. ROBERTON WILLIAMS: If we choose to tax investment income at 15 percent, then we're going to have situations like the Romney case where his overall income tax rate is relatively low. KEITH: The economic theory being that investment helps boost the economy and should be rewarded with a lower tax rate. Williams says Romney pays a much lower tax rate than your average wealthy person and about the same as your average middle-income American because they're also hit with payroll taxes for Social Security and Medicare. But there are some items in the Romney taxes that you won't find in most Americans' tax returns, including the Cayman Islands investments in a Romney family trust and a Swiss bank account. Both places are known as tax havens and Romney's legal team went to great lengths this morning to explain them away as perfectly normal. Romney's trustee says he closed the Swiss bank account in 2010 because, quote, \"it just wasn't worth it.\" Georgetown's Cooke says he can see why. COOKE: At the end the day, he probably felt they did not pass the smell test even though they may have been perfectly legitimate investments. And according to all accounts, he accounted for the gain on those accounts through his tax return. KEITH: If nothing else, these returns provide a window into the tax lives of the extremely wealthy who are able to make money largely because they already have so much. Tamara Keith, NPR News.

The income fairness debate has just gotten a lot more interesting. And it's taking place in anything but Mitt Romney's \"quiet rooms.\" Romney's release of his federal tax details for 2010 and 2011 came the morning that President Obama was preparing to deliver his State of the Union address, a speech in which he was expected to make the increasing gap between the superwealthy and everyone else a major topic of the evening. Obama even planned to have a prop. To underscore a point constantly made by  Warren Buffett that he and other members of the top .01 percent pay federal taxes at a much lower rate than the billionaire investor's secretary, the White House has invited that secretary to sit in the First Lady Michelle Obama's box Tuesday evening. Meanwhile Romney, who recently indicated his discomfort with public and boisterous debates about the ways government policies have contributed to the super rich controlling an ever larger portion of the nation's income, was forced on the defensive. Romney's personal lawyers and tax experts explained to reporters on a conference call Tuesday morning that, yes, Romney and his wife Ann made a tremendous sum from investments in 2010 and 2011, $21.7 million and $20.9 million, respectively. But even though they paid taxes at a relatively low rates, 13.9 percent in 2010 and an estimated 15.4 percent for the 2011 tax year which hasn't yet been filed with the IRS, they paid all that was legally required, $6.2 million for the two years, Romney's team said. And they made $3 million in charitable donations in 2010 and $4 million in 2011, giving more than 16 percent of their income to charity, much of that in the form of tithes, a commitment to give 10 percent of income, to the church, in the Romneys' case, the Mormon church. While Romney's surrogates on the tax-return conference call with reporters may be right that he did all he was legally require to do, that doesn't mean he doesn't have a political problem. First, it will be a tall order for Romney, whose net worth has been estimated at between $190 million and $250 million, to defend paying federal taxes at an effective rate that's so much lower than those paid by million of Americans of far more modest means. That likely explains in part Romney's reluctance in the first place to release his returns. Even rich politicians like Obama and Newt Gingrich, Romney's GOP challenger, paid their 2010 federal taxes at significantly higher rates, 26 percent and 31.5 percent, respectively. With Obama making economic fairness for the middle class an overarching campaign theme, Romney gives the president an ample target to attack. Two, Romney's tax information reinforces perceptions that for all his attempts to appeal to average voters, he's a full member of the nation's financial aristocracy with concerns far removed from the typical voter's. For instance, until 2010 his trustee kept a Swiss bank account for Romney which at one point held $3 million before the trustee closed it. Asked if it was closed because it was bad optics politically as some had reported, Brad Malt, the trustee said: \"... I decided that this account wasn't serving any particular purpose.  It might or  might not be consistent with Governor Romney's political views, you know again,  the taxes were all fully paid etc. But, it just wasn't worth it, and I closed  the account.\" Swiss bank accounts are just something that even a lot of wealthy Americans don't have, let alone middle-income Americans. Romney may continue to try to neutralize those who question how it came to be that the rich are snaring an ever greater share of the nation's overall income. On the Today Show recently with Matt Lauer, he accused them of engaging in the \"politics of envy.\" But that may not go over so well with voters, a majority of whom are, convinced that the wealthy aren't paying their fair share of taxes which just so happens to be the case Obama will make Tuesday evening all the way to Election Day.",

            "article_content": "Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, seen at a weekend campaign event in Ormond Beach, Fla., released 2010 tax returns showing he is among the top 1 percent of taxpayers.\n                \n                    \n                    Charles Dharapak/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, seen at a weekend campaign event in Ormond Beach, Fla., released 2010 tax returns showing he is among the top 1 percent of taxpayers. In releasing details of his tax burden for the past two years, Mitt Romney offered a small window into a vast wealth. The tax records show that the former Massachusetts governor made $42.6 million over the past two years and because most of it came from capital gains, he paid $6.2 million in taxes. That means that in 2010, his tax rate was 13.9 percent, and in 2011, it's expected to be 15.4 percent, lower than many Americans who pay taxes on wages. Romney was pushed into releasing his tax returns this week by a relentless attack from his fellow Republicans. Former House speaker and presidential hopeful Newt Gingrich led the charge by saying that Republican primary voters should have a chance to look at the documents to see if they had a flawed candidate. At first, Romney said he would not release his tax records at all, but after a bruising loss in South Carolina in which questions about his wealth and his company Bain Capital dominated, Romney relented. The Washington Post, which received a copy of the tax returns early, reports on some of the details: \"The couple gave away $7 million in charitable contributions over the past two years, including at least $4.1 million to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Romney's family has for generations been among the Mormon Church's most prominent members. \"The Romneys sent somewhat less to Washington over that period, paying an estimated $6.2 million in federal income taxes. According to his 2010 return, Romney paid about $3 million to the IRS, for an effective tax rate of 13.9 percent. \"For 2011, Romney estimates that he will pay about $3.2 million, for an effective rate of 15.4 percent. That's in line with his earlier estimates, but sharply lower than the rates paid by President Obama and Romney's closest Republican rival, Newt Gingrich.\" Obama paid a 25 percent tax rate, while Gingrich paid 31 percent in 2010. Reuters reports that Romney's tax records also show that an undisclosed amount of his money is in the Grand Cayman Islands and other places overseas. \"Romney advisers stressed that the holdings in the Caymans \u2014 along with those in a Swiss bank account that was closed in 2010 after an investment adviser decided it could be politically embarrassing to Romney \u2014 were reported on tax returns and were not vehicles to avoid taxes,\" Reuters adds. Over the past couple of weeks, Romney has defended his wealth and his tax rate, saying that he would \"not apologize for being successful.\" During last night's debate, Romney added that his tax bill is \"entirely legal and entirely fair.\" \"You'll see my income, how much taxes I've paid, how much I've paid to charity,\" Romney said. \"I pay all the taxes that are legally required and not a dollar more. I don't think you want someone as the candidate for president who pays more taxes than he owes.\" There were more than 500 pages of records released early this morning. So we'll update this story as we find more. Update at 3:02 p.m. ET. The Tax Rate Of Other Presidential Nominees: The Washington Post's Wonkblog looked at some historical data and found that Sen. John Kerry paid a 13.1 percent tax rate in 2003 and President Bill Clinton paid an 18.9 in 1990. Update at 11:26 a.m. ET. How Much Do Millionaires Usually Pay? It's worth noting that Romney not only pays an effective tax rate that is lower than some middle-class Americans but he also pays a lower effective tax rate than most of his fellow millionaires. The Tax Foundation reports: \"By contrast, millionaires pay an average rate of 25 percent. Although taxpayers earning between $2 million and $5 million pay an average tax rate of 26 percent, while those earning more than $10 million pay an average of 22 percent. We can speculate that one of the reasons for this is that much of their overall income comes from capital gains, which is taxed at 15 percent (only 20 percent of the total AGI for these $10 million-plus taxpayers is from salaries). However, even with this \"preferential\" tax rate on capital gains, the data clearly shows that their overall average tax rate is at least twice that of the nation as a whole.\" Update at 10:56 a.m. ET. The 0.006 Percent: The New York Times' Caucus blog is doing a stellar job of sifting through the data. They pick up on the 1 percent string. Romney's income puts him concretely into the upper crust of Americans. But how deep in? Here's The New York Times: \"According to the Internal Revenue Service's most recent available statistics of income, for 2009, there were 8,274 taxpayers with an adjusted gross income of $10 million or more, out of more than 140 million total returns filed. So anyone who makes more than $10 million would be in the top 0.006 percent of taxpayers. \"With an adjusted income of more than twice that - $21 million - in 2010, Mr. Romney would be even higher in the income strata.\" Update at 7:35 p.m. ET. Average Tax Rate Is 11 Percent: NPR's Tamara Keith explained on Morning Edition that the average taxpayer pays an effective tax rate of 11 percent. That calculation takes into account deductions and adjustments to gross income. Add to that the payroll tax and Medicare tax and it pushes it above Romney's rate of 15 percent. So how did Romney's rates stay so low? As we alluded to earlier, it has to do with the fact that taxes on capital gains \u2014 or money that comes from stock dividends, investments and interest \u2014 is paid at a 15 percent rate. Tamara explained that Romney amassed great wealth during his time at Bain Capital \"and now that money is generating more money and it's taxed at 15 percent.\"",

            "article_content": "The Arab League has launched a new plan to stop the crisis in Syria. The plan was announced in Cairo by the premier of Qatar. It comes after the Arab League's own observers completed a month-long mission in Syria.  DAVID GREENE, HOST: This is MORNING EDITION, from NPR News. I'm David Greene. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: And I'm Steve Inskeep. Good morning. Having sent observers to examine protests in Syria, Arab leaders have offered a plan to end the violence there. The proposal comes from the Arab League, a group of Arab nations. And NPR's Kelly McEvers has been following this story. She's in Beirut. Hi, Kelly. KELLY MCEVERS, BYLINE: Hello. INSKEEP: OK. So what do the Arab leaders want to do? MCEVERS: The Arab League is suggesting that the Syrian regime do a bold thing, that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad abdicate power immediately to his deputy, to his vice president. After that, what the regime should do, says the Arab League, is put together a kind of unity government, a transitional government, and then eventually pave the way for parliamentary elections in the country. I mean, it's a plan that's similar to the one that sort of ended the stalemate in Yemen. You saw the Yemen president step down, abdicate power to a deputy, and now there's a political process of a sort in Yemen. INSKEEP: Sounds like a nice idea, but is there any chance that Syria's president Bashar al-Assad is going to step down? MCEVERS: Well, look, this is a real opportunity, analysts here in the region are saying. I mean, the violence has reached a level that people are worried will not stop at this point. Hundreds of people have died just in the past month alone. Will the regime actually take this opportunity to stop the violence? Well, it's not looking very likely. On state TV, Syrian officials are saying the plan is basically just a conspiracy by the nations that want to bring down the regime. Officials basically called, you know, certain members of the Arab League, namely those who are leading this process, Saudi Arabia and Qatar, as those who fund terrorism. So, no. I mean, it's what we've seen in all these other Arab uprisings. Is a leader going to, you know, immediately say, yeah, sure, no problem? I'm going to step down. Doubtful. INSKEEP: So let's just review here, Kelly McEvers. Syria has gotten more and more attention as the so-called Arab Spring has gone on. It has been the scene of some of the more violent protests and violent crackdowns, actually, we should say, in recent months. Syria's leader, Bashar al-Assad, is determined to stay on, has said he's determined to stay on. What if he does not comply with this Arab League proposal? What happens? MCEVERS: The threat with the Arab League is that they would take it to the U.N. Security Council, that they would sort of ratchet it up a notch and go to the full, sort of, international body. The problem with that threat is that Russia continues to threaten to veto any measure on Syria, especially any measure that includes any kind of intervention at the international level. So the Assad regime at this point knows that it's got Russia on its side, and basically knows that it doesn't necessarily have to comply with any of these plans. INSKEEP: Well, Kelly McEvers, as someone who has slipped into Syria in various ways in recent months, I wonder what your sense is of the situation on the ground. Are there large numbers of people who are worried about total chaos in Syria, about losing all of their interests in Syria if the protest and the crackdowns continue the way that they have? MCEVERS: Yes. Definitely, yes. I think, in recent weeks, you had these Arab League observers in Syria. And there was some hope that because there were sort of eyes watching what was happening, that perhaps the situation would calm down. It has done the opposite. The situation has gotten much worse on the ground. It's looking more and more every day like a civil war. There are checkpoints. People are shuttering themselves inside their homes at night while the shooting goes on outside. The killing, the next morning, nobody knows who's done what. I mean, it cannot be overstated how bad the situation is getting. So I feel like most analysts and diplomats are saying, look, anything that could stem this violence at this point is worth trying. INSKEEP: Does Assad still have his supporters in Syria? MCEVERS: Definitely. I mean, especially in the cities of Damascus and Aleppo, the two main cities of Syria, where you've got an upper middle class and a middle class, for that matter, that's thrived under Assad. That said, the Syrian currency is starting to drop. The price of heating oil is going up. The availability of heating oil is sort of disappearing. So people are starting to suffer, are starting to feel the effects of this. And if that really takes hold, we'll see if that support remains. INSKEEP: Kelly, thanks. MCEVERS: Sure.

            "article_content": "Mitt Romney's tax returns and the tax rate he paid on his income have been hot issues in the recent Republican primaries. \"What's the effective rate that I've been paying? It's probably closer to the 15 percent rate than anything because my last 10 years, my income comes overwhelmingly from investments,\" the GOP front-runner recently told reporters. So why does a multimillionaire pay just 15 percent on his income? After all, the top income tax rate is 35 percent and many middle-class people pay over 20 percent. It's because most of Romney's income came from investments, so it came in the form of dividends, or in the form of capital gains \u2014 that is the increase in the value of investments that he sold. They're both taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income \u2014 the salaries most of us make at the office or the factory. NPR's Audie Cornish discusses the debate over the special tax treatment that investors receive with NPR's John Ydstie. So why the break for income earned from investments? The theory has been that if you tax investment income at too high a rate, you'll discourage investment and crimp economic growth and job creation. But it's somewhat controversial, not least because most of the people who get to pay that lower rate are well-off. In fact, 70 percent of the benefit goes to the top 1 percent of income earners. It's the rate paid by hedge fund managers and private equity managers, like Romney when he was at Bain Capital, though the rate was a bit higher back then. And it's the rate paid by investors like billionaire Warren Buffet. Buffet is quite famously appalled by the situation. He says it's not fair that he pays a lower rate on his massive income than his secretary pays on her middle-class salary. So does it benefit the economy enough to justify this apparent lack of equity that troubles Buffet? A number of economists say that there are no studies that prove that there's a benefit to the economy. They say it does make good sense though when it comes to taxing income from venture capital \u2014 income generated by increased value of new ventures and startups like when Apple and Microsoft were created a couple of decades ago. Source: IRS Those companies created huge numbers of jobs and boosted the economy. But the problem is, Congress hasn't been able to limit the tax break to that group. And it turns out that venture capital income represents less than one-tenth of the income that enjoys this low 15 percent tax rate. If you sell stock in Ford or General Mills and make a profit you get the lower rate; if you sell real estate and make a profit, you get the lower rate. But that's basically just a change of ownership and doesn't make a big contribution to economic growth or job creation, but you get the lower rate anyway. So economists seem to be saying that it doesn't make much sense that income from those kinds of activities is taxed at a lower rate than regular wages and salaries? That's right. And, in fact, the difference between the 15 percent capital gains tax rate and the top 35 percent for ordinary income encourages people to create tax shelters that allow them to claim their income as capital gains. And those tax shelters produce a huge amount of inefficient economic activity \u2014 in the past things like investing in office buildings that stand empty or city people buying tractors. These days, it's much more complex but just as damaging to the economy, not to mention that you have very smart people creating these tax dodges when they could be inventing more useful things that do create jobs. Is there any movement to change this in Washington? There's talk of tax reform, but no critical mass building around this issue yet. President Obama's bipartisan deficit commission did recommend that the tax rate on investment income should be the same as for ordinary income. Of course, there's a lot of interest on the part of some very powerful people in keeping this low rate, so I wouldn't hold my breath.",

            "article_content": "In South Carolina Tuesday, Mitt Romney confirmed that he will release his tax returns but not until April. The subject came up in Monday night's GOP presidential debate. Romney also said his effective tax rate is around 15 percent.  RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: Even if Wikipedia was working, you couldn't use it to locate information about Mitt Romney's most recent tax filings. He has yet to make that tax information public. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Under pressure from his opponents, Romney says he will release information in April. MONTAGNE: But yesterday, Romney did let slip a provocative tax detail. He acknowledged he's probably paying an effective tax rate of around 15 percent. And that's well below the rate that many middle-class families pay. NPR's Scott Horsley has more. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Mitt Romney came around to the idea of releasing his tax returns, very slowly. Initially, he had no plans to make his taxes public. Then on Monday, when pressed during a debate, he said he probably would. And yesterday, Romney went further, saying he will release his tax records, but not until tax season when his 2011 form is complete. MITT ROMNEY: I know that if I'm the nominee, people will want to see the most recent year, and see what happened in the most recent year and what things are up to date. And so they'll want to see the tax returns that come out in April. So rather than sort of have multiple releases of tax returns, why, we'll wait until the tax returns for the recent year are completed and then release them. HORSLEY: That schedule doesn't satisfy Republican rival Newt Gingrich. He argues South Carolina voters are entitled to see Romney's tax records now, before they cast their primary ballots on Saturday. NEWT GINGRICH: I believe we have the right to know, and therefore he owes us the knowledge. I'm not accusing him of anything. I'm just saying if there's nothing there, why not release it this week? HORSLEY: In addition to showing how much money Romney makes, the records would show how much he gives away, to whom, and how much he pays the government in taxes. Romney offered a hint about that last question yesterday when he was asked about his tax rate. ROMNEY: What's the effective rate that I've been paying? It's probably closer to the 15 percent rate than anything, because my last ten years, I've - my income comes overwhelmingly from investments. HORSLEY: And investment income gets special treatment under the federal tax code. Here's how it works: Middle-class workers collecting wages or salaries pay a top tax rate of 25 to 28 percent. Upper-income workers might pay as much as 35 percent. But people like Romney who make their money off investments, never pay more than 15 percent in taxes, no matter how much money they earn. The idea behind this favorable tax treatment is to encourage more investment, in hopes of making society richer. But it can also raise questions of fairness, questions President Obama has been highlighting for months. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: It is wrong that in the United States of America, a teacher or a nurse or a construction worker who earns $50,000 should pay higher tax rates than somebody pulling in $50 million. HORSLEY: The issue was famously raised by billionaire investor Warren Buffett, who complains he pays taxes at a lower rate than his own secretary. Mr. Obama suggested last fall, the tax code be modified so wealthy investors would pay rates at least as high as ordinary workers. OBAMA: Middle class families shouldn't pay higher taxes than millionaires and billionaires. That's pretty straightforward. HORSLEY: Straightforward or not, Mr. Obama's proposed Buffett principle has so far gone nowhere. But it's likely to get another airing from the White House, now that Romney has disclosed he's in the same low tax bracket as the billionaire Buffett. Meanwhile, Newt Gingrich wants to go in the opposite direction, and make investment income completely tax free. That would be a huge windfall for wealthy investors. But Romney says it's going too far. Romney has also proposed giving a larger tax break to investment income, but only for families making less than $200,000 a year. By the way, Romney said yesterday, not all of his money comes from investments, and not all of it is taxed at the special 15 percent rate. ROMNEY: I got a little bit of income from my book, but I gave that all away. And then I get speakers fees from time to time, but not very much. HORSLEY: The Democratic National Committee points out in 2010, Romney's speaking fees topped $374,000. Scott Horsley, NPR News, Columbia, South Carolina.

            "article_content": "With just days to go before the South Carolina primary, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney campaigned in Florence, S.C., Tuesday.  AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Audie Cornish. ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: And I'm Robert Siegel. Mitt Romney and his Republican rivals crisscrossed South Carolina today. The four men not named Romney are running out of time to make the case that one of them should be the GOP standard bearer in November. South Carolina hosts the first Southern primary on Saturday. And NPR's Scott Horsley reports that if the former Massachusetts governor wins there, it could all but seal the nomination for him. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Mitt Romney held an early morning rally in Florence, South Carolina. Aides had curtained off half the Civic Center ballroom, but the reduced space still seemed too large for the crowd that showed up. Unfazed, Romney stuck to his usual script, looking past the primary to the November race against President Obama. He paints that race in the starkest of terms, calling it a battle for the soul of America. MITT ROMNEY: I am so distressed as I watch our president try and replace ambition with envy, and poison the American spirit with class warfare. We are one nation under God. HORSLEY: Mathen Thomas(ph), who runs a marketing company, hadn't known exactly what to expect from the former Massachusetts governor. He came away impressed by what he heard from Romney. MATHEN THOMAS: More freedom, less government, I'm definitely interested in, and Romney seems like he has a plan to shrink the deficit and he doesn't want to shrink our military. So all those things, as an entrepreneur, are important to me. HORSLEY: With just four days to go before the primary, though, Thomas is not completely sold. After listening to Romney, he headed across town to where Newt Gingrich's supporters had gathered in a crowded art gallery. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) HORSLEY: During a televised debate last night, Fox News analyst Juan Williams had accused Gingrich of belittling poor people by saying they need paychecks rather than food stamps. The debate audience took Gingrich's side, giving the former House speaker a standing ovation. Gingrich was still glowing this morning. NEWT GINGRICH: We have been fed so much baloney by our liberal elites, and we are so sick of people who don't get it that I think people are just grateful to have somebody with the courage to tell the truth. HORSLEY: South Carolina voters seem to enjoy a good political fight, and Gingrich's aggressive style has won him a lot of fans, including this man. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: What I've been looking for in my candidate is fire in the belly. We've got to bloody Obama's nose. GINGRICH: Well, let me say, first of all, I don't want to argue with you about the analogy. I don't want to bloody his nose. I want to knock him out. (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER) HORSLEY: But Gingrich won't get that opportunity if Romney wins the GOP nomination. He warned that if South Carolina helps choose a moderate as the Republican nominee, it'll be that much harder to topple Mr. Obama. Gingrich said the only way to avoid that is for conservative voters in the state to unite behind him, not split their votes among the other contenders. GINGRICH: Any vote for Santorum or Perry, in effect, is a vote to allow Romney to become the nominee because we've got to bring conservatives together in order to stop him. HORSLEY: Rick Santorum, meanwhile, is arguing he should be the conservative choice. So far, there's little evidence that conservatives are banding together, and that leaves a big opening for Romney. Gingrich today criticized Romney for failing to release his tax returns, and for his tortured answer in the debate last night that he would probably do so at some point in the future. Romney acknowledged today his effective tax rate is well below that of many middle class families. ROMNEY: What's the effective rate I've been paying? It's probably closer to the 15 percent rate than anything because my last 10 years, I've - my income comes overwhelmingly from investments made in the past rather than ordinary income. HORSLEY: Investment income is taxed at a lower rate. President Obama argues millionaires like Romney should pay at least the same tax rate as those in the middle class, a debate we're likely to hear more of. Romney now says he will release his 2011 tax return once it's completed sometime in April. Of course by that time the primary contest may be effectively over.

            "article_content": "For the five remaining Republican presidential candidates, the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday was just another workday as they tried to improve their chances for an impressive showing in Saturday's critical South Carolina primary. A decisive win by front-runner Mitt Romney would probably spell the end of the race for at least one and maybe more of his rivals. So Monday night's Fox News debate in Myrtle Beach was one of the last opportunities for his competitors for the nomination to make the winner of the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary seem less like the inevitable nominee. On that score, while his rivals scored points against him, none seemed to do anything to upend his candidacy, and Romney, for his part, committed no major gaffes. So the former Massachusetts governor still seemed to have a good shot at winning South Carolina, a state which has voted for every eventual Republican nominee since 1980. But his two strongest challengers in South Carolina, Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker, and Rick Santorum, the former U.S. senator from Pennsylvania, had solid performances that could attract some voters to their ranks before the weekend. That said, here's some of what we'll remember, at least for a few hours, about the King Day Myrtle Beach debate: Romney fumbled the tax-return question: For weeks, Romney has been asked about releasing his personal tax returns like other leading candidates have done in past election cycles. Romney has resisted, with many observers guessing that his resistance could spring from the very real possibility that the superwealthy Romney's effective tax rate could be 15 percent, far lower than the rate at which middle-class Americans pay their taxes. You would have thought Romney would have already worked out a straightforward answer to the question of whether and when he would release his tax returns. He apparently hadn't, however, and it showed.  He gave what was one of his most convoluted answers of any debate, leaving the impression that he might release them in April but then saying \"time will tell\" and then indicating that he was only considering releasing them because \"we're showing a lot of exposure at this point,\" a campaign vulnerability. That sounded a lot like a variation of his infamous: \"I'm running for office, for Pete's sake.\" Santorum outdebated Romney: Early in the debate, Santorum outpointed Romney, and by a large margin, when he rhetorically duked it out with the former governor over an ad a pro-Romney superPAC hit Santorum with. In the ad, the pro-Romney superPAC accused Santorum of, while in Congress, voting for a bill that would have restored voting rights to convicted felons once they had fully paid their debt to society. The back and forth got a bit into the weeds, but Santorum essentially put Romney on the spot by asking him if he would forever disenfranchise such citizens. After dancing around a bit, Romney said he would only deny restoration of voting rights to those convicted of violent crimes, essentially agreeing in major part with the former senator. Santorum seized on the fact that it was MLK Day and that, as such, it was especially important to have the discussion about restoring the voting rights of citizens, particularly African Americans who are disproportionately imprisoned on nonviolent drug offenses. Score one for Santorum, who carries the hopes of much of the evangelical community or, more accurately, its leaders who over the weekend chose him as the conservative candidate to rally around in a bid to stop Romney. Gingrich isn't Mr. Sensitivity on racial issues: Juan Williams of Fox News elicited one of the debate's most indelible moments when he asked the former speaker if he couldn't see that saying that black Americans should demand jobs, not food stamps, and that poor kids lack a work ethic was insulting to many people, and not just to African Americans. \"No, I don't see that,\" Gingrich said, getting one of the evening's loudest ovations. Of course, there was some irony in that Williams, who caused a controversy in 2010 when he said people in traditional Muslim garb made him nervous on airplanes, was demanding sensitivity from Gingrich. Gingrich took the opportunity to lash out at liberals, intimating that they opposed poor people getting jobs or even earning incomes at all, which can only be believed by people who either don't know many liberals or only know those best defined as extreme or fringe. When Williams pressed Gingrich, the former speaker resorted to one of his favorite charges: that President Obama is the \"most successful food stamp president in history.\" Of course, that probably has more than anything else to do with the nation still recovering from the worst recession since the Great Depression, food stamps not existing in the 1930s and the U.S. population being significantly larger than during previous major economic downturns. The South Carolina audience, which was one of the most vociferous of all the debate crowds, ate up Gingrich's pushback, demonstrating that though the state may have a black Republican congressman (Rep. Tim Scott) and an Indian-American governor, racially themed messages can still get some white voters' blood stirred up. Paul is the total opposite of Romney: If the Massachusetts governor is suspected of saying whatever he thinks the voters he's trying to appeal to want to hear, the Texas congressman can never be accused of that. In a debate with a number of lively moments, some of the most energetic came when Paul said perhaps the U.S. should consider a foreign policy and national security version of the Golden Rule: \"Don't do to other nations what we don't  want them to do to us. We endlessly bomb these countries then we wonder why they get upset with us?\" That drew some of the loudest boos from some in the audience of the evening, supporters of a more muscular U.S. posture in the world. But when Paul added that the U.S. should stop \"warmongering\" and bring its troops home from overseas deployments, his supporters in the audience cheered and clapped. It was the one moment that demonstrated why the conventional wisdom is that Paul won't get the nomination. But it also demonstrated why Paul's admirers remain so steadfast. For them, he's a refreshing change \u2014 a politician willing to challenge his party's orthodoxy. Rick Perry makes few friends in Turkey: In what would have been a major gaffe if it mattered, which it doesn't since he's so far back in the pack, Texas Gov. Rick Perry said Turkey is led by Islamic terrorists. That assertion came as a surprise to many, probably not the least the Turkish government led by Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan. His Justice and Development Party is socially conservative and has been called Islamist-leaning by Western journalists, but that's a label party officials themselves haven't embraced. The Turkey statement wasn't the only one by the Texas governor to raise eyebrows. Sounding the states' rights theme, which is one of his favorites, he also declared that the federal government is at war with South Carolina and that the Obama administration is at war with religion. Perry has hoped all along to be the candidate of the Tea Party movement and Christian evangelicals. But while they have been desperate for a candidate to rally behind, they're not so desperate as to rally behind him. With Jon Huntsman dropping out of the race Monday and endorsing Romney after coming in third in New Hampshire, a state where he staked it all, the question is who is most likely to drop out next after South Carolina? The educated guess is that it will be Perry who, like Huntsman, has staked everything on an early primary state \u2014 in his case South Carolina \u2014 but has very high odds against seeing his gamble pay off.",

But the shorthand former House Speaker Newt Gingrich uses, calling the nation's first black president the \"food stamp president,\" is raising questions. It's a theme Gingrich has used since Iowa, and he returned to it during a forum in Charleston, S.C., over the weekend. \"Over here you have a policy which, with Reagan and me as speaker, created millions of jobs \u2014 it's called paychecks. Over here you have the most successful food stamp president in American history, Barack Obama,\" Gingrich said. South Carolina Rep. James Clyburn, who is black, says it is no longer the \"welfare queen,\" a line oft-touted by Ronald Reagan, but \"king of the food stamps.\" \"I guess a lot of people see it as, if Ronald Reagan can do it and be so lionized by conservatives, then I ought to be able to do it,\" says Clyburn, the third ranking Democrat in the House. Clyburn says it's an old strategy: candidates using race as a wedge to get votes. \"That is something they have been told will work to connect the president as being a black-oriented president, taking away from somebody else to give to black people,\" he says. That depends on the perception that African-Americans benefit disproportionately from the food stamp program, even though blacks are not the majority of food stamp recipients. But former Oklahoma Rep. J.C. Watts \u2014 a black Republican who is campaigning for Gingrich in South Carolina \u2014 says that's not what the debate is about. \"I think you have sensitivities, things that happen on both sides that I personally might not like, but I think it is a fact that more people [are] on food stamps today because we don't have jobs,\" Watts says. \"And that shouldn't be the economic policy of our country.\" Race Another Campaign Tool While Gingrich has received the most attention for linking the nation's first black president to food stamps, some of the other Republican candidates have also had to defend perceived racial insensitivities. Nothing in this year's contest, however, has reached the level of a notorious race-based whisper campaign in the 2000 South   Carolina primary. \"I think the marker everybody remembers is the story in the McCain campaign  \u2014 McCain's got a black child ... which is all very quiet but aggressively done,\" says University of South Carolina political science professor Mark Thompkins. Thompkins says race is one of several tools employed in the rough and tumble of South Carolina politics. Gingrich's food stamp line is more subtle, he says, but sends a message. \"That Newt is going to take care of us and not take care of them,\" Thompkins says. \"And there's an 'us and them' quality to this kind of language, which is pretty rough stuff, right?  But that's the code.\" Black voters were picking up on it Saturday, when Gingrich held a town hall at Jones Memorial AME Zion Church in Columbia. In attendance that day, Raushane Thompson questioned Gingrich about the characterization. Gingrich said it's not about the president \u2014 it's about his policies. \"I say that because more Americans today are on food stamps than in any other time in American history, and I think we need a policy that creates jobs and allows Americans to have a job and to have a paycheck,\" Gingrich said. Howard Furch turned out to hear Gingrich at a statehouse rally in Columbia. He thinks the food stamp line is less about race and more about whether the candidates get what it's like to struggle to put food on your table. \"He can ring up a $500,000 Tiffany bill, but he can relate to us? Oh, no,\" Furch said. \"Romney can sit up there and bet Gov. Perry 10,000 bucks \u2014 he can relate to us?\" Furch raised a question sure to be heard again in the fall: Are middle-class voters feeling more resentment toward the rich or toward taxes that pay for programs, like food stamps, intended to help the poor?",

New Hampshire voters could make Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney's nomination a near-certainty on Tuesday, when the state holds the first primary of the 2012 election. Every presidential candidate in modern history who has won both Iowa and New Hampshire has gone on to win the party's nomination. (Romney narrowly won the Iowa caucuses last week). Since 1920, New  Hampshire has been the first state to hold a presidential primary, and Granite State voters guard that status fiercely. The state's primary has become the birthplace, and sometimes graveyard, for presidential hopefuls, a phenomenon often dubbed the \"New Hampshire effect.\" Pat Buchanan and wife Shelley acknowledge the crowd at a rally on March 6, 1996. Buchanan won the New Hampshire primary but lost the GOP nomination to Bob Dole.\n                \n                    \n                    Michael S.

Buchanan won the New Hampshire primary but lost the GOP nomination to Bob Dole. In 1996, many Republicans blamed Pat Buchanan for dividing the party when he won the New Hampshire primary. That year, Bob Dole was the establishment candidate; yet Buchanan mounted an insurgent campaign to take the victory there. Buchanan tells weekends on All Things Considered host Guy Raz that he attributes the unexpected win to an endorsement from the New Hampshire Union-Leader newspaper, and what he calls a \"Catholic conservative, traditionalist, economic populist message,\" that fit the times. Insurgent candidates are often successful in New   Hampshire, Buchanan says, because the people there are receptive to candidates who challenge an establishment. Buchanan says he was the non-establishment candidate. \"New Hampshire has a great disposition, a great willingness, to unhorse the mighty,\" Buchanan says. \"I think that's one of the things that election was all about.\" New Hampshire's role in determining the GOP's nominee in the 2012 election will be important, Buchanan says. If Romney wins New Hampshire, Buchanan says the former Massachusetts governor has the legs to go the distance and become the Republican presidential nominee. But if that happens, and Romney is the GOP nominee, Buchanan says it will be a real test of his capacity as a diplomat and a politician. \"The Republican Party is a divided party in many ways,\" he says. \"Mitt and his people will have to go down and unite this party around the proposition that all of us may disagree on some issues, but we all agree on the proposition that the country can't take four more years of Barack Obama.\" Buchanan disagrees with the criticism that it isn't fair the 42nd most populous state in the U.S. has such a large hand in deciding such an important issue. \"The fact that Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina are the first three is a good thing; it is a healthy thing,\" Buchanan says. \"Because it does winnow the field and you do see if some of these front-runners really do have a glass jaw and they can't go the distance.\" Although he eventually lost the nomination to Dole, Buchanan, author of Suicide of a Superpower: Will America Survive to 2025?, says he's in favor of maintaining New   Hampshire as the first primary in the nation. The Senator From Colorado A month ago, former U.S. Sen. Rick Santorum was hardly considered competition in the Republican primaries. But when he nearly defeated front-runner Romney in the Iowa caucuses last week, everything changed. The case of a presidential hopeful pulling ahead after Iowa isn't a first. In fact, something similar happened in 1984. Just before the Iowa caucuses that year, Sen. Gary Hart of Colorado wasn't getting much love from the media or the Democratic Party establishment. But after he made a strong showing in the state, the cameras started to follow him. Sen. Gary Hart won the New Hampshire primary and carried 25 states to the Democratic National Convention, but ultimately lost the nomination to then-Vice President Walter Mondale.\n                \n                    \n                    AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Sen. Gary Hart won the New Hampshire primary and carried 25 states to the Democratic National Convention, but ultimately lost the nomination to then-Vice President Walter Mondale. Just a month or so before the New Hampshire primary of 1984, Hart was polling 2 percent nationally and 5 percent in New Hampshire, far behind the presumed front-runner, Walter Mondale. Hart took advantage of New Hampshire's tradition of bucking trends and going for insurgents, so he started campaigning on that theme. It worked; Hart won the primary by 10 percentage points. Hart, now a professor at the University of Colorado at Denver, tells NPR's Raz that at the time there was a sense, particularly from younger Democrats, that the party had begin to stagnate. \"I felt that there was a generational opportunity there,\" Hart says. \"And I felt that if I could get to New Hampshire that I had a very good chance of demonstrating that there was a base ... for a new generation of leadership.\" The strong Iowa showing, the increased media attention and the strong victory in New Hampshire helped Hart carry 25 states in the primaries and go to the 1984 Democratic National Convention with 1,200 delegates. It wasn't enough, however, and Mondale became the Democratic nominee for president, ultimately losing to the incumbent, President Reagan. Looking back, Hart says the 1984 race and his contribution was a defining moment for many, including him. \"It is one of those events that almost never reoccur in your lifetime, and you treasure it and you treasure the relationships that shared that experience with you,\" he says. \"It was very hard work, but we had a lot of fun.\"",

Perhaps no country has seen its image in the Arab world soar as quickly as Turkey, a secular state that's run by a party with roots in political Islam. As part of our series on the Arab Spring and where it stands today, NPR's Peter Kenyon examines whether the \"Turkish model\" can be exported. As Tunisians held an election in October, merchant Mohammed Bengerbal paused in front of his shop in the capital, Tunis, to ponder a question: Now that Tunisia's dictator is gone, what kind of government does he really want? \"We want Tunisia to become a modern country, not extremist,\" he says. \"A place like Turkey. People work hard there and also practice Islam. They are modest and modern at the same time.\" If there was one way for me to define what makes Turkey unique compared to all of its Muslim neighbors to the south and east, it's what I call the 'Turkish miracle' \u2014 and it's not a political miracle, it's an economic miracle. Soner Cagaptay, Turkey analyst at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy As secular, despotic regimes tumbled in Tunisia, Egypt and Libya, the iron fist that had been throttling opposition parties was no longer there. Suddenly north Africans are looking to political Islam not to fight off a dictatorial regime, but to guide them toward a better future. And when they look around to see where that has actually been achieved, they find Turkey, with its ruling Justice and Development Party, known as the AKP, and its deeply religious Sunni Muslim prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Erdogan recently toured the revolutionary Arab states, and during a visit to Egypt he was mobbed by adoring crowds, packed with supporters of Egypt's rising political power, the Muslim Brotherhood. The adulation was interrupted, however, when the Turkish leader went on television to tell Egyptians they shouldn't be afraid of secular government. That was a notion that didn't sit well in a culture where for many people \"secular\" translates as atheist or anti-faith. Turkey analyst Soner Cagaptay, with the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, says it must have been a surprise for Erdogan, who's accustomed to being seen as the   conservative in the room at home. \"He was given a hero's welcome, and then the next day he goes out to them, he says, 'Oh, by the way, you gotta be secular too,' \" Cagaptay said. \"And I think this shows to you that the Turkish model in some ways is perhaps not so directly transferable.\" Many Arabs admire Turkey as an Islamic state with a modern economy and a democratic political system. Here, Turks break their fast during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan on a bridge in Istanbul in August.\n                \n                    \n                    Mustafa Ozer/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Many Arabs admire Turkey as an Islamic state with a modern economy and a democratic political system. Here, Turks break their fast during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan on a bridge in Istanbul in August. Turkey's Appeal But on one crucial level, Turkey has a far more powerful and fundamental appeal, says Cagaptay \u2014 it's a Muslim country that works, with a large and growing middle class. \"If there was one way for me to define what makes Turkey unique compared to all of its Muslim neighbors to the south and east, it's what I call the 'Turkish miracle' \u2014 and it's not a political miracle, it's an economic miracle,\" he says. Except for a brief downturn during the recession of 2008, Turkey under Erdogan has grown at a robust clip for most of the past decade. And crucially, large numbers of ordinary Turks in the broad Anatolian heartland have moved up into the middle class. Erdogan's top foreign policy adviser, Ersat Hurmuzlu, says people around the Middle East are demanding not just the right to choose their own leaders, but the right to a better future. \"People are seeing the success on the economic side in Turkey,\" he says. \"And they are questioning themselves: If Turkey has conducted this, why we cannot do that? So this is a normal question, and we urge the people to ask this question themselves,\" he says. Turkish writer and analyst Mustafa Akyol says the Arab Spring had many causes, but it's useful to focus on a question that has dogged the region for centuries: Why has the Muslim world lagged so far behind the West? Part 1: Turning Elections Into Democracy Part 2: Islamists On The Rise Part 3: Syria \u2014 A Looming Civil War? Part 4: Bahrain \u2014 An Uprising Suppressed Today: Turkey's Expanding Role Part 6: The U.S. And The Arab Spring Akyol says the answer often heard in recent decades, pushed by hard-line Islamists, was that Muslims weren't being pious enough \u2014 they had to grow even more conservative. \"Well, the AKP in Turkey, the Justice and Development Party, gave a different answer to this question. They said, well, 'We lagged behind because we did not work enough.' And they remained pious, but they also did what everybody does in the world when you want to build a better economy. So I think this is something now realized by the more reasonable actors in the Middle East economy as well,\" he says. A Growing Economy If you want to see Turkey's economic miracle in action \u2014 and get a taste of how it could be threatened by regional changes \u2014 the southeastern city of Gaziantep, near the Syrian border, is a good place to start. The production lines are clanking away at this factory owned by the Naksan Holding Group. These aren't high-end luxury goods, but company officials say Naksan is one of the top three producers of plastic packaging in Europe, and in the top 10 worldwide. Business is booming: From a few hundred workers at its start, Naksan now employs some 4,000 people. As the taxi drivers here like to boast, with only slight exaggeration, in Gaziantep everybody works. In recent years, the city enjoyed thriving relations with northern Syria, especially in the city of Aleppo. Those relations took years to build, but crashed very rapidly last year as Erdogan became one of the most vocal critics of Syria's bloody crackdown on dissent. Taner Nakiboglu, a Naksan board member, is bullish on Turkey's prospects, but he doesn't like to see good business go bad because of politics. \"Aleppo is very close, only 80 miles. So, they were coming here, we were going there \u2014 this is now stopped,\" he says. \"Normally, technically you can go, they can come without visa, but because of security reasons nobody wants to go.\" Turkey's Evolving Role In another corner of the city sits a stark reminder of how Arab Spring politics have changed Turkey's foreign policy. The Syrian Consulate \u2014 the only foreign consulate outside Istanbul or Ankara \u2014 is dark and empty. The sign next to the padlocked door reads, \"Closed Until Further Notice.\" Among activists seeking to overthrow Arab dictators, this is a tangible sign that Turkey has finally come down on the side of the people despite its longstanding economic ties to autocratic regimes. At a recent forum here on the Arab Spring, Turks were the first to admit that their model is still a work in progress. As one speaker put it, \"If you copy us, please don't copy our record on minority rights\" \u2014 a reference to longstanding suffering by Kurds, Alawites and others. Another noted the scores of journalists in Turkish jails and chimed in, \"and don't follow our lead on freedom of the press, either.\" Professor Ibrahim Ghanem, an Egyptian who teaches in Dubai, says many Arabs are now taking a closer, more skeptical look at the Turkish model. \"What is the meaning of 'Turkish model'? Do you mean in dealing with minorities like Alawites and Kurds? Do you mean the Turkish model in terms of the vital role of the army in the political life? So, it is a vague argument when you talk about Turkish model,\" he says. But for all its flaws, Turkey today presents the clearest example of a modern and moderate Muslim country. And as it sets about trying to rewrite its constitution, analyst Sabiha Gundogar at Sabanci University says Arab Spring countries can see Turkey, for all its economic success, still struggling to improve its democracy. \"Why Turkey is so relevant to the region is that democracy is still in the making also in Turkey, as well. So, I mean, that's also another aspect that makes Turkey very relevant to other countries that are also remaking themselves,\" she says.",

The Newt Gingrich  campaign bus is rolling again Monday morning, leaving Waterloo, where the candidate spent the night and heading  straight east to the small town of Independence. The venue? Heartland Acres  Agribition Center, a modest-size exhibition hall for small, regional  agribusiness conferences with a lot of interesting old farm implements on  display, and a shop with some pretty cool toy  tractors. Gingrich continues to  try to reverse a slide in public opinion polls and voter perception. I've heard  from many Iowans in the last week or so who had been leaning toward the former  House speaker a few weeks ago, but now feel he may have too much baggage to be  the GOP nominee for president. Certainly, the intense negative ad campaign  targeting him has been effective and, on Sunday, Gingrich fought back against the man he says is the main source of the anti-Newt air campaign: Mitt  Romney. As I reported in my  Morning Edition piece, when asked if feels he's been \"swift-boated,\" ala  Democrat John Kerry in 2004, Gingrich responded, \"No. I've been Romney-boated.\" One interesting side  note: Gingrich was asked at that event in Marshalltown on Sunday about the Citizens United ruling  by the US Supreme Court, which led to the creation of Super PACs that raise and  spend unlimited amounts on behalf of or against any candidate. Restore Our  Future is the Super PAC that supports Romney and is behind most of the attacks on  Gingrich. \"I think the current  mess is a disgrace,\" Gingrich said of the wide-open negative spending allowed by  Citizens United. \"I think it debilitates politics.  I think it strengthens  millionaires, and it weakens middle-class  candidates.\" \"My solution would be to  eliminate all the election laws, and allow people to give unlimited personal  money after tax and file every night, and let the candidates run the campaigns  and have the candidates run the campaign and have the candidate be  responsible,\" Gingrich said. Gingrich isn't happy  with Romney saying he has nothing to do with the Super PAC attacks and his  appearing to stay above the fray. Gingrich points out many of the Super PAC's  donors are Romney donors, and that it has several former Romney  staffers. And then the man who has been insisting on a positive message turned pretty negative. Of Romney, Gingrich  said, \"somebody who will lie to you to get to be president, will lie to you when  they are president.\"",

            "article_content": "Concluding that he can win the Iowa caucuses, former Mass. Gov. Mitt Romney spent the weekend campaigning in western Iowa, a mostly conservative region. After months of making only periodic visits to the state, Romney is making an aggressive final push through Iowa.  LINDA WERTHEIMER, HOST: It's MORNING EDITION from NPR News. I'm Linda Wertheimer. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: And Steve Inskeep, on this official New Year's holiday. Good morning. Republican presidential candidate, Mitt Romney, has publicly complained, in recent weeks, about the narrative told about his campaign. He's referring to countless political stories suggesting that he can't quite break through. Republican voters seemed to have searched almost everywhere for an alternative. WERTHEIMER: What Romney says, in his defense, is that he's stayed consistently near the top of the polls, as his rival rise and fall. A new Des Moines Register poll gives Romney a narrow, but hardly safe, lead in Iowa, which holds its presidential caucuses tomorrow. He's contending, with Congressman Ron Paul in second, and former Senator Rick Santorum who's climbed into third. INSKEEP: NPR's Don Gonyea spent the past two days following Romney in western Iowa. DON GONYEA, BYLINE: For many months, the Romney campaign was downplaying expectations in Iowa, keeping them as low as possible. It was a strategy borne out of the unexpected loss the former governor was handed in the Iowa caucuses four years ago. But now, buoyed by steady and solid poll numbers, Romney is campaigning like a guy who thinks he can win tomorrow. (SOUNDBITE OF APPLAUSE) MITT ROMNEY: Oh, you're just so generous. To be here on New Year's Day, all the football going on, thank you for welcoming us and saying hi. GONYEA: That was Romney yesterday in Council Bluffs, way over on the Nebraska border. He spoke to a packed house in a high-ceilinged ballroom. Romney's presence in the conservative western side of the state is a sign that he's looking for votes everywhere. On the stump he ignores his GOP rivals and targets President Obama. ROMNEY: You know I've been looking some video clips on YouTube of President Obama \u00e2\u0080\u0093 then-candidate Obama \u00e2\u0080\u0093 going through Iowa making promises. And I think the gap between his promises and his performance is the largest I've seen, well, since the Kardashian wedding and the promise of till death do we part. (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER) GONYEA: He said the president's economic policies have failed. He rattled off statistics; 25 million Americans unemployed or underemployed or no longer looking for work, median income dropping 10 percent in the past four years. ROMNEY: Gasoline, health care - those things have continued to go up. The American middle-class is really struggling under this president GONYEA: But while Romney wants to portray this as a race between him and President Obama, the contest for the nomination is only just beginning. In Iowa, he and Ron Paul are so close it's within the margin of error. And now the biggest story in the state is the sudden rise of Rick Santorum, who's now in a position to seriously think about winning in Iowa. At a news conference yesterday, Romney was asked about Santorum's rise. He answered by reminding people that Santorum endorsed him for president four years ago. ROMNEY: And we've been friends. I can tell you that our backgrounds are quite different. Like Speaker Gingrich, Senator Santorum has spent his career in the government in Washington. Nothing wrong with that, but it's a very different background than I have. GONYEA: Romney has traveled Iowa from east to west in the past week. The issue that has most dogged his campaign, the health care bill he signed while governor of Massachusetts, has barely come up. No voters asked about it at town hall events he's held, though this young man did raise it as he shook the candidates hand after an event in the city of Le Mars. Romney had a ready answer. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Did you say, you would let the states decide for themselves if they would adopt kind of a Romneycare type system? ROMNEY: No, the states have the right to determine their own system for caring for their own poor, under the Tenth Amendment, just like we have now. So I would return to the states, the authority they have currently, because I don't want to see Obamacare imposed on the entire nation. GONYEA: Plenty of other topics come up, some tried and true. In Sioux City, there was a question about gun ownership and the Second Amendment. ROMNEY: Thank you. You know, I like all the amendments, including the Second Amendment. And I believe in the right of Americans to bear arms. GONYEA: But for really off-the-wall, there was this one from the same event. Romney was asked if he wins: Will he bring back the candy Pop Rocks that fizzle and crackle in your mouth. His answer, surprisingly nuanced. ROMNEY: There are a lot of things I can blame on the president. You know? (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER) ROMNEY: But I'm not going to blame him for getting rid of Pop Rocks. And I got to tell you, I'm afraid the market just wasn't there. But... GONYEA: OK, don't look for that to come up a whole lot. But these are the Iowa caucuses - candidates never know what kind of pop quiz they'll face. The final test, in the form of voting, takes place tomorrow night.

Like a mirror that reflects one's ideology back at the viewer, and no more so than during a general-election year, the political players saw what they wanted, and what they thought was most politically useful to their side, in the reports Monday by the Social Security and Medicare trustees on the long-term prospects for those two entitlement programs. For their part, those who support the programs' essential structure preferred to look at the glass as half full. Yes, the latest forecast suggested that Social Security would in 2033 exhaust the combined trust funds from which both the retirement and disability payments are drawn, three years sooner than was predicted last year. Meanwhile, the Medicare trustees said their latest prediction still called for that program to exhaust the money with which it pays the hospital bills of the elderly by 2024, same as last year's forecast, while the outlook for other parts of the program worsened. Those who defended the social-insurance programs against those they said would dismantle them, pushed back against the idea that the programs were flawed beyond repair, however. For instance, Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner, one of the trustees, said Tuesday: \"As today's reports make clear, these programs have the resources they need to fulfill their commitments to these Americans for years to come. But what these reports also reinforce is that we must take steps to keep these programs whole for the future... \"... The President is... committed to keeping Social Security strong for future generations, particularly as more private employers move away from defined benefit plans... \"... At the same time, adjustments to Social Security and Medicare must be balanced and evenhanded. We will not support proposals that sow the seeds of their destruction in the name of reform, or that shift the cost of health care to seniors in order to sustain tax cuts for the most fortunate Americans. Thus the release of the reports became an opportunity for Geithner to remind voters that the Obama administration viewed itself as a staunch defender of the nation's most popular entitlements while accepting the need for gradual changes to make the programs more sustainable. Since Geithner was speaking as an administration and not campaign official, the name of the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, Mitt Romney, or certain congressional Republicans, went unspoken. Republicans were less circumspect, however. Lanhee Chen, the Romney campaign's policy director, said in a statement: \"Today's report reminds us that Medicare must be reformed and strengthened or it will soon collapse. It also reminds us that President Obama continues to play shell games with the health care of our seniors, taking hundreds of billions from Medicare to spend on Obamacare and now using a bogus experiment to conceal the damage until after the election. President Obama has offered no serious plan of his own, preferring instead to attack and point fingers over problems he refuses to address. Mitt Romney has a comprehensive plan to preserve Medicare for today's seniors while ensuring that it remains strong for future generations.\" Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) also singled out the president as well as congressional Democrats in a statement: \"Today's report confirms what Republicans have long said: The biggest threat to Medicare and Social Security is doing nothing, and the refusal of the White House and congressional Democrats to address our fiscal challenges will have devastating consequences for America's seniors. Last year, we had an opportunity to begin to deal with our debt crisis and help save Social Security and Medicare for future generations of seniors, but the president lost his courage, moved the goalposts and demanded tax increases on small business job creators. The nation needs leaders who understand how our economy works; who understand we can't tax our way back to prosperity; who have the courage needed to confront our nation's serious problems. Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI), the House Budget Committee chairman whose controversial proposals for entirely remaking the entitlement programs, also used the reports as a chance to claim vindication for his approach and chide President Obama: \"... In the heart of their retirement, current seniors are scheduled to be hit with a 25 percent across-the-board benefit cut when Social Security's trust funds are exhausted. Meanwhile, Medicare's looming insolvency puts at risk the critical access to care that seniors have come to expect from this important program. \"Rather than work together to advance solutions, the president has opted to play politics with seniors' care. The President and his party's leaders continue to distort efforts to save and strengthen Medicare in an effort to distract seniors from the consequences of their health care law. Ryan has become a foil for Obama and other Democrats who have used his plan to change Social Security into a voucher program for future seniors as a way to make many voters view congressional Republicans as a threat to the continued existence of popular program that's nearly 80 years old. Regardless of which side of the ideological divide observers were on, there was agreement that something had to be done even if that's where any consensus ended. What seemed safe to say, however, was that it was virtually impossible that anything would be done this of all years with presidential and congressional campaigns raging.",

Paul Ryan of Wisconsin It seems like only yesterday when House Budget Chairman Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin introduced a federal budget that would change Medicare as we know it. Actually, it was a year ago when Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican, offered, controversially, a federal spending blueprint that would transform Medicare from a single-payer health insurer for seniors into a program that would give them money to purchase insurance on the private market, so-called premium support. House Republicans rallied around the budget while President Obama, congressional Democrats and progressives ceaselessly attacked Ryan, sometimes with well-reasoned arguments, but not always. Their core argument was that Ryan would turn Medicare into a voucher system. In any event, Ryan's proposal allowed Democrats to raise voter concerns that Medicare would be gutted, contributing to a Democratic victory in an upstate New York special election in a traditionally Republican congressional district. Undeterred, Ryan and House Republicans are expected to make public Tuesday their latest budget proposal. And while full details aren't out, the expectation is that it will once again propose that Medicare become a premium-support program for people under a certain age. Last Thursday, Ryan released a video meant to seize the high ground from Democrats who accused him of being irresponsible for producing that first budget. It was his critics who were the irresponsible ones, Ryan argued. RYAN: \"You know, I was here \u2014 in Congress \u2014 in 2008 when we had the economic crisis. It was a terrible time. Millions of people lost their jobs. Trillions of dollars of wealth: gone. \"That crisis caught us by surprise. \"Let me ask you a question: what if your President, your Senator and your Congressman knew it was coming? What if they knew when it was going to happen, why it was going to happen and more importantly, what if they knew what they needed to do to stop it from happening and they had the time to stop it? But they chose to do nothing about it, because it wasn't good politics? \"What would you think of that person? It would be immoral.\" National Journal's Nancy Cook reports that the budget is expected to cut domestic programs while leaving defense spending largely untouched: \"If the debt crisis is predictable in Ryan's mind, than so too are the contours of the House Republican budget to be released early this week. Pivoting off Ryan's plans from 2011, this budget is expected to emphasize lower spending for domestic programs, which could mean financial hits to everything from protecting the environment to agencies that regulate banks or programs that offer job training. \"The budget will propose a change in the structure of Medicare and Medicaid, and it will offer absolute protection of defense spending, a move Democrats call politically disingenuous because it flies in the face of the sequester laboriously agreed to last year that mandates across-the-board spending cuts for both defense and discretionary spending beginning in 2013. \"The details of how the Republicans plan to pay for delaying the sequestration remain unclear, as does the topline figure for spending.\" Meanwhile, progressive groups were spinning up to take on Ryan II, a somewhat modified proposal that has a Democratic ally, Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon. Paul N. Van de Water, a senior fellow with the left-leaning Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, wrote: \"The Ryan-Wyden plan would shift substantial costs to Medicare beneficiaries rather than protect them from cost increases, in part because the payment that beneficiaries would receive to help them buy coverage would likely fail to keep pace with health care costs.  The plan also would likely lead to the gradual demise of traditional Medicare by making the pool of Medicare beneficiaries smaller, older, and sicker \u2014 and increasingly costly to cover.  Finally, the plan would produce few budgetary savings beyond those that the health reform law calls for, since both plans have the same target growth rate for Medicare costs.  The Ryan-Wyden plan is similar to Newt Gingrich's 1995 proposal that, according to Gingrich, would have caused traditional Medicare to 'wither on the vine.' \" Worth noting is that Ryan isn't punting during an election year. He and House Republicans are clearly showing a tolerance for the risks that come with campaigning on a controversial proposal at a time of superPACs. In a way, it's not unlike Obama's decision to run on his controversial health care law, which polls poorly among many voters. What seems safe to say is that while the positions taken by both Ryan and Obama will rile their committed critics, their bases are likely to be encouraged.",

Medicare, the federal health insurance program for about 50 million senior and disabled Americans, is simultaneously one of the most popular and imperiled programs in America. Its participants \u2014 and their relatives \u2014 tend to be highly satisfied with the generous health benefits it provides. But some 78 million baby boomers are now beginning to qualify for the program at a rate of an estimated 10,000 every day. The first presidential debate earlier this month in Denver had an entire segment devoted to the subject of health care. And it's almost certain to come up in tonight's debate in New York. But it wasn't the 2010 health law that the candidates brought up first in the last debate. It was Medicare. Specifically, each candidate went after what he saw as the weaknesses of the other candidate's plan. Here's what President Obama had to say: \"The idea, which was originally presented by Congressman Ryan, your running mate, is that we would give a voucher to seniors, and they could go out in the private marketplace and buy their own health insurance. The problem is that because the voucher wouldn't necessarily keep up with health care inflation, it was estimated that this would cost the average senior about $6,000 a year.\" Romney countered with a critique of what President Obama's health law would do to Medicare: \"For current retirees he's cutting $716 billion from the program. Now, he says by not overpaying hospitals and providers, actually just going to them and saying we're going to reduce the rates you get paid across the board, everybody's going to get a lower rate.\" Independent fact checkers, including this one, took issue with exactly how the candidates described each other's plans. But the outlines are basically accurate. President Obama's plan fundamentally relies on slowing Medicare spending gradually. Romney, meanwhile, would dramatically remake the program. He'd change it from one that's largely run by the federal government to one that's largely run by private insurers. \"I know my own view is I'd rather have a private plan,\" he said in the debate. \"I'd just as soon not have the government telling me what kind of health care I get. I'd rather be able to have an insurance company. If I don't like them, I can get rid of them and find a different insurance company.\" But the bottom line is that both candidates are walking a political tightrope. On the one hand, says Drew Altman, president and CEO of the Kaiser Family Foundation, it's Medicare, not the health law, that could help turn the election. That's what the foundation's most recent poll found. \"The voting issue in this election, if health care is a voting issue, is much more Medicare than it is the Affordable Care Act,\" Altman says. And seniors are important \u2014 not only because they vote more reliably than other voters, but also because they're a key voting bloc in swing states like Florida and Ohio. But Altman says the same poll last month that found seniors are making Medicare a voting issue also found something else \u2014 that they pretty much like Medicare the way it is now. \"The verdict is very clear, especially with seniors,\" he said. \"They're anxious about changing the traditional program.\" Now a prudent politician would say, \"OK, let's just not touch Medicare.\" After all, they don't call it one of the third rails of politics for nothing. But that's no longer an option, not with those 10,000 baby boomers turning 65 every day for the next two decades. \"We as a society are not willing to put the resources in to let Medicare go along as it's going along,\" says Jonathan Gruber, a health economist at MIT and an architect of both the health plan passed by Massachusetts under then-Gov. Romney and the Affordable Care Act. \"To keep Medicare solvent over the long run would require taking the current Medicare payroll tax, which is about 2.9 percent, and taking it up to 12 percent or more of payroll. And we're just not willing to do that.\" That means that Medicare spending will have to be reined in somehow. Gruber says he likes the way the Affordable Care Act takes on Medicare \u2014 with a variety of approaches. They include not only reducing some payments to health care providers but also experimenting with ways to provide financial incentives for higher-quality care. \"It's a balanced approach,\" Gruber says. \"It's basically saying, 'Look, there's lots of different things we need to do for Medicare to make it work better. We don't really know which one is the ultimate long-term solution. But we need to move forward.' \" GOP candidate Romney, meanwhile, says he prefers the power of the marketplace. \"This is an idea that's been around a long time,\" he said at the debate, about the concept known as premium support, \"which is saying, 'Hey, let's see if we can't get competition into the Medicare world so that people can get the choice of different plans at lower cost, better quality.' I believe in competition.\" But clearly when it comes to Medicare, both candidates also share the belief in using it as a weapon to wield against their opponent, in an effort to scare seniors. That's something that's been true for several elections now, and it's shown no sign of changing this year, either.",

Paul Ryan of Wisconsin as his running mate may help energize support from conservative voters who like his tough approach to overhauling the federal budget. But there's a risk that Ryan may turn off an important voting bloc: senior citizens. Ryan has proposed transforming Medicare into a voucher-like program with fixed payments. That's an important issue for senior citizens. And in Florida, seniors will help determine who wins the state in November. Voters 65 and up make up about 18 percent of the state's population, but they are more than a quarter of the state's registered voters. Around the state, you can find many in retirement communities like Wynmoor Village, a large over-55 community west of Fort Lauderdale with some 9,000 residents. This part of Florida \u2014 Broward County \u2014 is a Democratic stronghold, with much of that strength coming from senior citizens in retirement communities. Medicare Debate Gets Personal Mikkie Belvedere runs a long-established Democratic club. She says she was already familiar with Ryan when Romney named him as his pick for vice president. \"Well, I felt, here we go. Here's a man who is looking to totally mess up the budget for senior citizens,\" Belvedere says At the heart of Belvedere's concerns is how Ryan would change Medicare. He's proposed controlling the program's growth through an option that would cap payments to senior citizens and allow them to buy their health insurance on the private market. Current senior citizens would be unaffected. Ryan's plan would only apply to people who now are under age 55. Marilyn Gerber, another Wynmoor retiree, says for her that makes little difference. She's still opposed to any big changes to the program. \"He's not going to do away with Medicare for seniors, but he will for Medicare for my kids and my grandkids,\" Gerber says. But Gerber and Belvedere don't speak for all the seniors in Florida \u2014 or even in Wynmoor. Changing Demographics In another Wynmoor building, Carolyn Stricklen convenes a meeting of the community's Republican club. This club's been around for just four years. It was started by Sid Feldman, shortly after he retired to Florida after a long political career in Philadelphia. \"The first meeting that I held, I was approached by two older ladies. And they kissed me on either cheek and said, 'Thank you for letting me out of the closet,' \" Feldman recalls. At Wynmoor and other retirement communities throughout Florida, things are changing. Younger retirees, including many from traditionally Republican states, are changing the demographics and political outlook of Florida's senior citizens. Seniors are an important part of Florida's large and active Tea Party movement. And there are many, like Andrea Bellito, who are thrilled with Romney's choice of Ryan. Bellito even has a prediction: \"The Romney-Ryan team is going to be called the dynamic duo, the new look of America, because that's what we need,\" Bellito says. 'Why Are You Scaring Me?' Bellito and other Romney supporters at Wynmoor embrace Ryan's proposal to reshape Medicare \u2014 saying big changes are needed if the nation is going to rein in debt and avoid a fiscal meltdown. But Feldman says for Romney and Ryan, overcoming Democratic scare tactics will be a major challenge. \"Tell me the truth,\" Feldman says. \"Don't tell me stories. What are you going to do? I'm 79 years old. I can keep my Medicare the way it is. So why are you scaring me?\" University of Central Florida political science professor Aubrey Jewett says the potency of Medicare as an election issue is an old story in Florida. Although President Obama carried the state in 2008, Jewett says his opponent, Sen. John McCain, won the senior vote. \"One of the reasons was that they worried about cuts in Medicare because of the Obama reform plan that he was proposing. And, you know, this time around the shoe is potentially on the other foot,\" Jewett says. While Obama and other Democrats attack their opponents for Ryan's Medicare plan, Romney and Ryan are firing back. They're accusing Obama of cutting Medicare himself to help pay for his health care plan.",

Despite his re-election and more Democratic seats in Congress, President Obama has far from a free hand to make the kind of comprehensive deal House Speaker John Boehner and other Republicans are demanding \u2014 one that includes cuts to entitlement programs. Strong resistance to that notion is coming from the political left, including warnings that while Obama won't have another re-election, most of his allies on Capitol Hill will be facing voters again. \"Any benefit cuts to Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid have to be off the table,\" said Ilya Sheyman, campaign director for MoveOn.org Civic Action, in an interview. \"I think it's certainly true that no Democratic member of Congress \u2014 whether it's in the House or the Senate \u2014 should be surprised if they end up facing a primary after voting to cut Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security programs.\" Sheyman said the performance of political progressives in turning out the vote for Democrats in the recent election gives them the right not only to be heard but also to have their demands met that entitlements be left unscathed in negotiations to avert the combination of major tax increases and drastic spending cuts scheduled for the end of the year. That's a dangerous notion, says David Walker, who as comptroller general headed the Government Accountability Office from 1998 to 2008 and who endorsed Mitt Romney for president. \"I'm concerned that liberals have misread the election and are overreaching,\" Walker said Tuesday at a U.S. Chamber of Commerce event. \"There's actually no question that the president campaigned on more revenues and more [sacrifice] from the wealthy. I think it's legitimate for him to say that,\" said Walker. \"But to say that he has more than that is not credible. And what we're hearing right now is we're hearing grand bargain-type numbers on revenues but not grand bargain numbers\" for entitlement reform. Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md., the second ranking House Democrat, told journalists last week that \"you've got to put everything on the table\" in talks with Republicans. Even the suggestion got him in hot water, leading to social media demands for House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi to oust Hoyer from leadership. Some activists urged like-minded progressives to raise their voices to get Hoyer to recant. \"Seniors on Medicare did not cause our deficit \u2014 Bush tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans, two wars and Wall Street's recession did,\" a blog post on BoldProgressives.org argued. \"They should not be asked to pay through their hard-earned benefits.\" As of Tuesday, Hoyer certainly didn't seem to be backing away. He told journalists, according to The Hill: \"I agree that everything's on the table, but that doesn't mean we're for everything,\" he said. \"Some of those are not advisable. ... We need to protect and strengthen Social Security and Medicare.\" Progressive groups aren't the only ones poised to give the blues to any Democratic policymaker willing to discuss entitlement reforms; there's also the ostensibly nonpartisan (and powerful) advocacy group AARP. \"On behalf of our 37 million members and their families, AARP will fight for an open, thoughtful public discussion about how to strengthen Social Security and Medicare, and against cramming changes to these vital programs into a last\u2013minute deal that could harm all of us,\" AARP announced on its website. The progressive position, as expressed by Sheyman, is that middle-class and working-class families, the hardest hit by the Great Recession, most rely on those entitlement programs and aren't in a position to make more sacrifices \u2014 unlike the top 2 percent of taxpayers. If entitlement changes must be made, some progressives have floated the idea of giving Medicare the ability to negotiate pharmaceutical prices, a power Congress explicitly denied the program when it enacted the Medicare drug benefit in 2003. Or, they say, raise the cap on income on which Social Security taxes are paid past the current $110,100. But it's not at all clear that would appease Boehner and Republican leaders. Which means the two sides have some work to do even in framing any discussion around possible changes to entitlements. \"As the Republicans have become less intransigent on the revenue side ... the other side has become much stronger against any kind of reforms against entitlements,\" said Rudolph Penner, an economist at the Urban Institute think tank who was Congressional Budget Office director from 1983 to 1987, speaking at Tuesday's Chamber of Commerce event. \"One thing that puzzles me about this, if you really project out to where we're going, to a sovereign-debt crisis, which seems to be inevitable if we don't change these policies, the people who are really going to be hurt are the poor,\" said Penner. \"All you have to do is to look at southern Europe to see what's going on. Twenty-five percent unemployment in Greece and Spain. Imagine what the minority unemployment would be if we had a 25 percent unemployment rate on average in the United States.\"",

Analysts expect there will be a lot of scrambling. Some of the states that are trying to ban the individual mandate going forward have Democratic leadership. Missouri has re-elected its Democratic governor, but has banned him from setting up a state exchange. Robert Siegel talks to Julie Rovner.  ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: While big questions remain about how we'll avert the fiscal cliff, one issue is much more settled today than it was yesterday - the future of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. The president's reelection and the Democrats' continued control of the Senate mean that implementation of the law will move forward. And joining us to talk about the next steps is NPR's Julie Rovner. And first, Julie, what did we learn from this election about the health care law? JULIE ROVNER, BYLINE: Well, two big things I think. First, it's still kind of hanging by a thread. Last night's national exit polls showed that while health care remains the second most important issue to voters - though it trailed the economy by a mile - voters remained badly divided over the fate of the law. Forty-nine percent said they'd like to see some or all of it repealed, while 44 percent said they'd like to see it expanded or left as is. The second thing I think that is for better or worse, this law is henceforth going to be known as ObamaCare, which of course started as a slur from its opponents. But now even the president is calling it that. Here he is at his speech in Colorado in September. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: You know, he calls it ObamaCare and, you know, I like the name. I do care. (SOUNDBITE OF CHEERING) SIEGEL: So what happens to ObamaCare now? ROVNER: Well, when the law passed in 2010, a lot of people complained about how long it would be before the big parts that really expand coverage were to take effect, not until January 2014. Well, now that's just over 13 months away and there is a lot to do, and not all that much time left to do it in. States have to decide by November 16th - yes, nine days from today - whether or not they're going to implement an insurance market shopping exchange or let the federal government do it for them. And when those exchanges start is also when people have to have - either have insurance or else pay that controversial penalty. But it's also when insurance companies also have to have to stop discriminating against people with pre-existing conditions. So it's really all the big stuff that people have been waiting for. And thanks to the Supreme Court decision, states also have to decide whether or not they're going to expand their Medicaid programs for individuals earning under about $15,000 a year. A lot of governors were waiting to see if Mitt Romney got elected and made the law go away. Now they're going to have to actually make that decision. SIEGEL: Well, voters nationwide may have indirectly voted to retain the law by reelecting President Obama but in some states, voters specifically tried to save no to at least parts of it. I want you to talk about that. ROVNER: That's right. There were five separate health law-related ballot measures in five separate states. They all passed except that Florida where, of course, it needed 60 percent, but it didn't even get 50. Now, in three of those states - Wyoming, Alabama and Montana - the ballot measures are aimed at - blocking the controversial portion of the law that the Supreme Court upheld, that individual mandate that requires most people to have insurance or pay that penalty. But because state law can't over ride the federal law, those measures actually don't have very much effect. It's just kind of a talking point. In Missouri, however, our fifth state, voters passed a measure forbidding the legislature or their newly reelected Democratic governor from creating a state exchange. That presumably will have some effect, particularly since the governor had wanted to use his executive power to do just that. And it should guarantee that the federal government will do it instead. SIEGEL: Finally, Julie, we just heard about the looming debate around the fiscal cliff. Is ObamaCare, is it on the table? Could the fiscal cliff talks include potential changes or cuts to the health care law? ROVNER: Well, some people are speculating that it could end up being part of some grand taxing and spending bargain. Remember, the health law makes some pretty significant changes to Medicare and Medicaid. Those are big players in any deficit negotiation package 'cause they're such a big part of the budget. So there's some reason to think that a final budget deal could include some tweaks to the health law, although certainly not a full repeal or even probably a major rewrite. SIEGEL: Thank you, Julie. ROVNER: Thank you, Robert. SIEGEL: That's NPR health policy correspondent Julie Rovner. Copyright \u00a9 2012 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "1 of 8 Is civility about to stage a comeback in Washington? Some of the most controversial members of Congress have lost their seats. Still, there appears to be little danger that vitriol is about to go out of style. A number of outspoken members are coming back, including at least one who had previously lost his seat. Also, while there may be a net loss in the number of members who have attracted a great deal of media attention by making testy statements or ending up in ethics investigations, some who have been more moderate in temperament won't be coming back, either. \"The partisan tone is likely to remain quite harsh, despite the departure of a few of the more extreme voices,\" says David Canon, a University of Wisconsin political scientist. Following last night's elections, here's a quick look at the state of bombast in Congress: OUT Rep. Todd Akin, R-Mo. The 12-year House veteran lost a bid for Senate against Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill. He gained national notoriety in August with his statement that \"legitimate rape\" didn't cause pregnancy so there was no need to exempt rape victims from abortion bans. That comment gave fresh life to previous Akin claims such as his claim that school lunches and the Medicare program violated the Constitution. During the GOP Senate primaries this spring, Akin referred to the federal student loan program as \"the equivalent of the Stage 3 cancer of socialism.\" Rep. Pete Stark, D-Calif. The 20-term member had long made intemperate remarks but lost his seat owing to changing circumstances. Redistricting left him with less favorable terrain and, thanks to California's new \"top two\" primary system, he faced a fellow Democrat in the general election. Stark was forced to apologize in 2007 for saying Americans were being sent to Iraq \"to get their heads blown off for the president's amusement.\" Stark was so strident his own party refused to promote him to Ways and Means chairman even though he had seniority. Rep. Joe Walsh, R-Ill. Walsh, a feisty freshman member of the Tea Party Class of 2010, was ousted after just one term. He received national attention last month for saying abortion was never necessary to save the woman's life. \"With modern technology and science, you can't find one instance,\" he said. Walsh had been caught on video yelling at a female constituent, called on President Obama to \"stop lying\" about the risk of default, and complained that his Democratic opponent Tammy Duckworth, an Iraq war veteran who lost both legs, talked too much about her military service and injuries. Rep. Allen West, R-Fla. Another Tea Party freshman, West raised huge amounts of money for his first re-election campaign but appears to have narrowly lost. He's demanding a recount. The former Army officer has argued that Islam is a \"totalitarian theocratic political ideology\" rather than a religion; said 80 House Democrats were \"members of the Communist Party\"; and embraced several anti-Obama conspiracy theories. IN Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn. Despite a huge fundraising advantage, Bachmann barely won re-election to her redrawn district. She enjoyed a brief moment in the sun last summer as a leading presidential contender, but she has also taken a slew of controversial positions. She claimed that the HPV vaccine caused mental disabilities, suggested Democrats in Congress are \"anti-American,\" and intimated that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's aide Huma Abedin might have ties to the Muslim Brotherhood. Rep. Alan Grayson, D-Fla. Grayson, defeated in 2010, is coming back. During one of the most partisan political climates in history, Grayson still manages to make his colleagues seem mild. He has called members of the GOP \"right wing lunatics,\" an ex-lobbyist a \"K Street Whore,\" and the man who unseated him in the 2010 election \"Taliban Dan.\" He gained national fame during the health care debate in his first term for saying the GOP health plan was to advise Americans \"don't get sick\" but if they do to \"die quickly.\" Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y. First elected in 1970, Rangel survived a near miss in the June primary. Rangel was weakened by an ethics investigation surrounding his personal finances that led to his censure by the House in 2010, making him the first member so admonished in nearly 30 years. Rangel had been forced to step down as chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif. Waters had no trouble winning re-election to her 12th term after the House Ethics Committee cleared her in September of financial wrongdoing, following a three-year investigation. She has long been known as one of the more unvarnished members of Congress, sometimes telling colleagues to \"shut up.\" At a rally in 2005, she said, \"George W. Bush, go to hell,\" proceeding to list three Cabinet members she felt he should take along with him.",

Mitt Romney, who had opposed a government-sponsored auto-industry bailout. \"President Obama stood by American workers in their darkest hour, and UAW members and citizens in communities that are part of the thriving auto industry are grateful for his willingness to bet on us,\" UAW President Bob King said.

Here, NPR reporters have more about his challenges and successes in the areas of the economy, national security, energy and health care: The Economy As this election year began, candidates and commentators were confident the U.S. economy would be the key issue. But in the end, according to NPR national economics correspondent Marilyn Geewax, this was more specifically an \"auto bailout\" election rather than a generic economy election. When Obama took office in January 2009, the auto industry was on the verge of financial collapse and he pushed hard for Congress to provide federal support to keep the car companies and their suppliers alive. Mitt Romney opposed such aid, and did so publicly in a New York Times op-ed headlined: \"Let Detroit Go Bankrupt.\" Congress, however, backed the bailout, and the companies rebounded. The president used that victory, and the resulting economic improvements in Michigan and Ohio, to appeal to blue-collar workers in the industrial Midwest and helped lock down his re-election. National Security NPR Pentagon correspondent Tom Bowman says Obama left little or no room for Romney to maneuver against him on national security, and his position as a strong commander in chief clearly helped in his re-election effort. Obama shook the \"soft on defense\" tag the GOP often assigns to Democrats with several major actions: the killing of Osama bin Laden in a risky raid that accomplished what his predecessor did not; ending the war in Iraq, which polls showed Americans felt was long overdue; and approving a surge of 30,000 troops in Afghanistan. The president also wisely kept on President George W. Bush's defense secretary, Robert Gates, for the first three years, giving him cover with the Republicans when he was able to make cuts in certain defense programs. Energy Despite the October surprise of Superstorm Sandy that brought renewed attention to climate change and energy policy, NPR correspondent Tom Gjelten says there is scant evidence that climate change concerns drove voting decisions in this election. Obama was much less outspoken in his advocacy of green energy and renewable fuel in this campaign than he was in 2008, and his strategy might simply have been to see that energy issues were not decisive. Romney largely framed the debate, promising over and over to achieve North American energy independence by 2020. The president partially neutralized that pitch with his own promise to cut oil imports in half and even indicated he might approve the controversial Keystone pipeline \u2014 same as Romney. Given Obama's victory, it seems the energy policy debate was one he could afford to downplay. Health Care In 2010 Democrats ran away from the newly passed Affordable Care Act, while Republicans rode its unpopularity, in part, to a takeover of the House. Julie Rovner, who reports on the politics of health care for NPR, says that didn't happen this year. Obama embraced the originally negative \"Obamacare\" label the GOP gave the health care law, saying he liked the name because, \"I do care.\" In just about every stump speech the president was quick to take credit for many of the popular aspects of the law that have already gone into effect, including allowing young people up to age 26 to stay on their parents' health plans; ending annual and lifetime insurance limits; and requiring insurance companies that spent too much on administration and profits to send refunds to policyholders. The president also turned the tables on the GOP's hits from 2010 on the Medicare cuts in the health law by pointing out that the Republican plan for Medicare would be far more threatening to the long-term viability of the program than any of the changes made by the Affordable Care Act.",

Lungren is running for re-election in California's 7th Congressional District. Dan Lungren has been in and out of public office since 1979. The Republican represented a Southern California district in the '80s, served as the state's attorney general for eight years, and then returned to Congress to represent the Sacramento area in 2004. These days, he's still the same pro-business, limited-government conservative he's always been, Lungren told a friendly audience in the Sacramento suburb of Rancho Cordova. \"There's a reason people are leaving California [and] going to Texas, leaving California [and] going to Nevada, and it's not for the weather,\" he told the crowd. \"So I make no apologies whatsoever that I am about more jobs, not more taxes!\" Money Pouring In That message played well in the past when his district was slightly more conservative, but now Lungren finds himself with a big target on his back. \"Just to let you know, I was informed just before I came over here, more money has been spent against me in this race than any other candidate for Congress in the country,\" he said. At least that was true when he gave the speech. Since then, other races have become more expensive. But it is true that Democrats and outside PACs have spent more than $4.5 million trying to defeat Lungren. Democrat Ami Bera is challenging Lungren. Bera ran against Lungren in 2004 and lost, but since the district was redrawn, the race has become competitive.\n                \n                    \n                    Rich Pedroncelli/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Democrat Ami Bera is challenging Lungren. Bera ran against Lungren in 2004 and lost, but since the district was redrawn, the race has become competitive. Some of that money buys ads accusing him of being in the pocket of Wall Street and Big Oil. Then there's one by a Democratic-backed superPAC, criticizing Lungren for his opposition to stem-cell research. \"This is Rep. Dan Lungren,\" the ad goes. \"He's running for Congress. He voted against embryonic stem-cell research. Is he a doctor?\" Lungren may not be a doctor, but his rival is. He's a first-generation American named Ami Bera. \"We've got our secret weapon and it's all of you,\" Bera, the Democrat in this race, told a crowded room of phone volunteers. \"You guys are the reason we're going to win this thing. This is going to be one of the most important races in the country.\" Redistricting Fuels Competition Bera ran against Lungren two years ago and lost. But he's back for a rematch in a redrawn district where registered Democrats have an edge of 2 percentage points. In the closing days of the campaign, Bera is trying to make the case to independent voters that Lungren is too ideological. \"Leadership is about saying I may disagree with you, but let's figure out where we agree, let's build on those ideas and let's go out and serve the citizens of this country and the residents of this community,\" Bera says. \"I think Dan Lungren is going to lose because it's a failure of leadership.\" But Bera's also the target of a lot of outside money. The nearly $3 million has paid for a variety of ads, including one that attacks Bera for supporting President Obama's Affordable Care Act, otherwise known as Obamacare. \"When you go in that voting booth, you need to know who you're voting for,\" the ad says. \"Ami Bera supports the health care law, which will increase taxes on California families and businesses and cut $716 billion from Medicare. Californians just can't risk Ami Bera in Congress.\" All the outside money underscores the fact that this Sacramento-area district was designed to produce tight races, says University of Southern California political analyst Dan Schnur. \"This is precisely the type of district that Californians thought they were getting when they supported a change in the redistricting rules and gave the responsibility to an independent commission,\" he says. \"That's not to say they were looking to endanger more Republican incumbents, rather they just wanted to see more competitive races from candidates on both sides of the aisle.\" Schnur says that competition makes California's 7th Congressional District exactly the kind of suburban swing district that might help determine control of the House of Representatives. Even the candidates themselves say this race is too close to call.",

            "article_content": "Political speeches are for partisans who attend political rallies. So what happens when a Democratic operative listens closely to Republican Mitt Romney's stump speech?  ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: As part of our ongoing elections coverage, we're talking stump speeches. Today on MORNING EDITION, we had a Republican political consultant listen to President Obama's remarks with a critical ear. Now, it's Mitt Romney's turn. Here's NPR's Tamara Keith with help from a Democratic operative. TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Tad Devine is ready. He has a yellow legal pad next to his laptop as he watches Governor Romney's speech in Henderson, Nevada. TAD DEVINE: OK. Here we go. MITT ROMNEY: He's been reduced to try to defend characters on \"Sesame Street\" and... (LAUGHTER) ROMNEY: ...word games of various kinds and... DEVINE: I could be quibbling about some this, but I'm going to wait until he says something really wrong, OK? (LAUGHTER) KEITH: Devine, who was a consultant for both the Gore and Kerry campaigns, doesn't wait very long. ROMNEY: We've gone through four debates with the vice presidential debate and my debates, and we haven't heard an agenda from the president. KEITH: Devine hits pause. DEVINE: He's presented a comprehensive agenda. He's done so in writing. He did it - he's done it on his website. He's done it repeatedly. So this idea or proposition that President Obama has not laid out an agenda for the next four years or for the country's future is simply not true. KEITH: Romney then moves on to the main theme of his stump speech, that the country can't handle four more years of President Obama's policies. ROMNEY: I mean, can you afford four more years with 23 million Americans looking for a good job? UNIDENTIFIED GROUP: No. DEVINE: That's a very misleading figure. KEITH: The way Romney gets to that number is by taking the 12 million people who are unemployed, adding those who are working part-time but would like to have a full-time job and those who have stopped looking for work but would like to have a job. To Devine, it seems like the challenger is looking to put the labor market in the worst possible light. DEVINE: You know, if you just pile number on top of number, you can get to this astronomical number of 23 million. But it in no way reflects the unemployment rate in the country. It's about half as big as that. KEITH: Later in the speech, Romney talks about the deficit under President Obama and what he'd do differently. ROMNEY: We'll finally cut federal spending. We'll cap federal spending and get us on track to a balanced budget. KEITH: Devine pipes in again. DEVINE: Governor Romney has not proposed a plan to put the nation on track to a balanced budget, and neither has his running mate. I mean, frankly, his running mate's plan, which they passed through the House of Representatives, doesn't achieve a balanced budget for decades. KEITH: Paul Ryan's budget doesn't eliminate the deficit until 2040. As for Romney's budget plan, the campaign says it would balance in eight to 10 years. Nonpartisan budget watchers say there's not enough detail to conclude that, and it would likely require such deep cuts it would be politically impossible. ROMNEY: Four more years like the last four years means that we would see Obamacare. And that means that your health insurance premiums would go up by $2,500 a person. It puts the government in the doctor's office with you. KEITH: For Democratic consultant Devine, this is a two-part whopper. DEVINE: I don't know where he's coming up with these numbers for the increased cost of insurance premiums under Obamacare. I guess you can always find a study to support whatever you're saying. KEITH: The campaign cites a report from the Congressional Budget Office. It says premiums could go up by $2,400 for a whole family, not per person. In part, that's because more family members would join the plans. But the report also says for many people, the increased costs would be offset by government subsidies. As for the government in the doctor's office, Romney is alluding to an independent board created by the healthcare law to look for cost savings in Medicare. And this really has Devine bristling. DEVINE: There is absolutely no change in the nature of the relationship between patients and doctors, OK? We still are going to have a system of private doctors who have patients who have insurance, which is private insurance. The doctors are not going to work for the federal government. KEITH: Devine pauses the video with almost every applause line. At one point, he raises his arms and then grabs his head like he can't believe what he's seeing. For this Democratic operative, watching a speech intended for Republican partisans, it's as if he's entered an alternate reality. And in part, he says that's just the nature of campaign speeches, though he wishes it wasn't that way. DEVINE: There should be some limits, you know? (LAUGHTER) DEVINE: There should be some rules.

The messages went out between 7:30 and 10 p.m. They were anonymous but quickly traced to a Republican consulting firm in Northern Virginia. The messages appeared to be targeted mostly at cellphones from the Washington, D.C., 202 area code. But some were also sent to area codes outside the Beltway, including one to a St. Louis number and another to a private email address. Some of the messages slam President Obama on the usual issues.For instance, \"re-electing Obama puts Medicare at risk\" read one text. Another sent out the message, \"Obama Lied About Libya \u2013 What else could he be lying about?\" But many others, the ones dealing with same-sex marriage and abortion, had a sharper edge: \"Obama supports homosexuality and its radical agenda\" and \"if re-elected Obama will use taxpayer money to fund abortion.\" The websites sending these messages have names like GOP messagers and Democrat Liars. Federal law generally prohibits the sending of political robocalls and robo-texts to cellphones. But those provisions don't address emails that are sent to cellphones as text messages. The sites were registered at the Web hosting company Go Daddy.com. On Wednesday, Go Daddy suspended them. Nick Fuller, a spokesman for Go Daddy, says its terms of service are clear cut. \"When a customer uses a domain name registered thru Go Daddy to participate in activities such as spamming via email or text messaging, instant messages, pop-ups, that's not something that we tolerate,\" Fuller says. It appears that all of the websites related to the text messages were registered by employees of a Republican consulting firm, ccAdvertising of Centreville, Va. The firm's website brags about its ability to reach cellphones. It says its clients have included McDonald's; Starbucks; Grover Norquist's anti-tax advocacy group, Americans for Tax Reform; and GOP politician Ken Cuccinelli, now Virginia's attorney general. In an email conversation with NPR, ccAdvertising's president, Gabriel Joseph, wouldn't address the messages sent last night. He said the firm has always scrupulously complied with the law.",

Joe Walsh  and challenger Democrat Tammy Duckworth before a televised debate at the WTTW studios on Oct. 18, 2012, in Chicago. One of the most bitter congressional races is in the suburbs of Chicago, where controversial freshman Republican Joe Walsh is fighting to keep a seat he was actually drawn out of. The Tea Party favorite's bombastic rants frequently get him into trouble, even with members of his own party, and Walsh is facing a tough Democratic opponent in Iraq war veteran Tammy Duckworth, who lost both of her legs in combat. When the two political opponents get together, it doesn't take long for the fireworks to begin. They've battled over spending cuts, taxes, Medicare, social security, and in a recent debate on public television, Walsh's opposition to abortion, without exception. \"Not for rape, incest, or life of the mother,\" Duckworth said of her opponent. \"He would let a woman die, rather than give her\u2014\" \"Now Ms. Duckworth, that's not fair,\" Walsh interjected. After that debate, Walsh told reporters that abortion is never necessary to save the life of the mother. \"There's no such exception. With modern technology and science, you can't find one instance,\" he said. After being called inaccurate by medical groups, Walsh backtracked. To Tammy Duckworth, the comments are part of a pattern. \"Unfortunately, this is Mr. Walsh,\" Duckworth says. \"He has repeatedly said many things that are inappropriate, many things that are not true, and that he continues to say things that are very irresponsible, especially in a sitting congressman.\" Indeed, Walsh stands out among the freshman class of Tea Party-backed Republicans much more for what he's said than for anything he's done. Walsh has called the president a tyrant and idiotic, and he's suggested Duckworth is not a true war hero because she talks too much about her service. He's even berated constituents at town hall meetings. Walsh has insisted he is not a loose cannon. \"There are times when I've gotten ahead of myself and whenever I've felt like I've stepped over the line, I've tried to apologize,\" he said at a debate. But Walsh says he has no regrets, adding that most constituents he meets appreciate his brand of straight talk. \"I think we're all sick of politicians who poll test every single word that comes out of their mouth,\" he says. \"This country is broke. This great, good country is dying right now. I'm an odd duck in that I'm not driven by my re-election.\" In a way, Walsh has nothing to lose. The former political activist is getting only limited support from his own party, and Democrats have targeted Walsh from the start. They carved Walsh and almost three quarters of his old district out of Illinois' Eighth, and made it one that not just leans more Democratic, but a district that would favor Duckworth in particular. She ran and narrowly lost six years ago in a neighboring district, much of which is now in this new district. Conservative superPACs and tax exempt groups have come to Walsh's rescue, however, airing a steady drumbeat of negative ads attacking Duckworth. Duckworth has plenty of money on her own side, and has hit back at Walsh \u2014 hard. The latest Chicago Tribune poll shows Duckworth leading Walsh by 10 points. Political scientist Alan Gitelson at Loyola University of Chicago says Democrats see a symbolic opportunity in defeating Walsh. \"Knocking him out would certainly be a very strong message that the Tea Party can't hold onto all of the candidates they hope to hold onto in the House of Representatives,\" Gitelson says. Joe Walsh's seat is one of five Republican congressional seats in Illinois that Democrats hope to pick up, and in a race that has been nasty from the start, constituents should only expect the mudslinging to intensify in its final days.",

No matter who wins the election on Nov. 6, official Washington will have to deal with something called the \"fiscal cliff\" before the end of the year. What's coming is a perfect storm of expiring tax cuts, scheduled budget cuts, and various other spending changes scheduled to take place Jan. 1 unless Congress and President Obama (who no matter what will still be president until next Jan. 20) agree on a way to avert them. As two of the largest spending items in the federal budget, the Medicare and Medicaid health programs are expected to play a role in how the deal gets done. Under the provisions of the law that created the budget deal Congress will attempt to undo, Medicare is subject to a two percent cut in provider payments, while Medicaid is exempt. But two new studies and a proposed class action lawsuit settlement suggest a lot of dollar signs could change as lawmakers start to think about how to address the impending mess. The first, the proposed settlement in a long-running dispute between advocates for Medicare patients and the federal government, is actually likely to increase Medicare spending, although how much remains unclear. The suit was brought by the Center for Medicare Advocacy on behalf of a class of patients with chronic conditions who had been denied Medicare coverage for home care, nursing home care or other services on the grounds that the patients' conditions were not expected to \"improve\" with care. The settlement, assuming it is approved by the judge in the case, means that \"the Medicare Benefit Policy Manual Will be revised to correct any suggestion that continued coverage is dependent on the beneficiary improving,\" said the organization in a statement. The change is expected to affect as many as tens of thousands of beneficiaries with conditions ranging from multiple sclerosis to Parkinson's' to diabetes, arthritis, and heart disease. But while it will boost spending for Medicare by preventing many of those patients from spending themselves into poverty, it could well end up saving money for Medicaid. And a new survey from the Kaiser Family Foundation finds that after one of the fastest growing years for that program, Medicaid spending growth slowed dramatically in 2012. Total state Medicaid spending grew by an average of two percent in fiscal 2012, \"among the lowest rates of growth ever recorded,\" according to the study. By contrast, spending in fiscal 2011 rose by 9.7 percent. Part of the slowdown was due to a recovering economy, which made fewer additional people eligible for the program, the survey found. Part was also due to states imposing their own cost controls on the program, in part stemming from the end of additional temporary federal funding that came as part of the 2009 stimulus law. And that spending could go down more \u2013 a lot more \u2013 if Mitt Romney is elected and implements his plan for Medicaid, according to yet another study out this week. This one, commissioned by the Kaiser Family Foundation and done by researchers for the Urban Institute, looked at the potential impact of implementing the plan approved by the Republican-led House. That's similar to the one Romney is proposing. The study found that the combination of repealing the Affordable Care Act (which calls for a major expansion of Medicaid) and limiting federal payments for Medicaid could together reduce federal Medicaid spending by $1.7 trillion from 2013 to 2022. That represents a 38 percent cut in federal funding for the program. The study estimated a range of how many people would lose coverage, depending on how states react. The estimates, however, range from a low of 31.3 million fewer people being covered to 37.5 fewer million people being covered.",

But he's also running for re-election in Wisconsin's 1st Congressional District.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Paul Ryan is not just Mitt Romney's vice presidential running mate. He is also a member of the House of Representatives from Wisconsin, of course, and a candidate for another term. And while he's spending a lot of time on the presidential campaign trial, the seven-term congressman is also spending lots of money to hold onto his district in southern Wisconsin. Ryan is still considered the favorite to win that race, but as Chuck Quirmbach of Wisconsin Public Radio reports, his Democratic challenger is trying to make it a competitive race. CHUCK QUIRMBACH, BYLINE: When Paul Ryan has been in Wisconsin the last couple months, it's mainly to stump for a bigger office. At a rally last week in Waukesha, he said he looks forward to deer hunting here next month. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) QUIRMBACH: But Ryan is also running for re-election to represent Wisconsin's first congressional district. Under Wisconsin law, Ryan could not take his name off the House ballot after being chosen as Mitt Romney's running mate. So Ryan joins Joe Biden and Joe Lieberman as politicians who've run for both vice president and Congress in the same year. But to the frustration of some Democrats here, most of Paul Ryan's campaigning for Congress is being done through TV ads funded by his big campaign war chest. In this commercial, he asks a small group about Medicare. (SOUNDBITE OF POLITICAL ADVERTISEMENT) QUIRMBACH: Ryan's ads mostly address issues he's raised on the Romney-Ryan ticket, and except for a brief logo, never mention Ryan's House contest. The Democrat in this race is Rob Zerban, a former county supervisor and business owner. Zerban recently invited reporters to watch him knock on the door of Ryan's House campaign office in Janesville, something Republicans called a political stunt. (SOUNDBITE OF KNOCKING) JEANETTE: Hi. ROB ZERBAN: Hi. You must be Jeanette(ph). JEANETTE: You must be Rob. Nice to meet you. Great. ZERBAN: I wanted to come over. We've got... QUIRMBACH: Zerban gave the staffer thousands of signatures calling on Paul Ryan to debate him. The district's blue collar cities of Kenosha, Racine and Janesville were represented by Democrat Les Aspin for about 20 years in the 1970s and '80s. A few years later, Ryan was elected to represent the district. Now Zerban wants the seat, and he's frustrated that Ryan won't debate him. ZERBAN: He has a duty and an obligation to fulfill the responsibilities of running for both offices, and I think one of those is debating me here in the first. QUIRMBACH: At a nursing home rummage sale near Ryan's upscale Janesville neighborhood, supporter Gerri Schuler says the congressman doesn't need to debate Rob Zerban. GERRI SCHULER: I'm more concerned with the loyalty, the trustworthiness. As a human being, he's a very upstanding young man, or younger man. QUIRMBACH: But in downtown Janesville, Kristine Moser says her support for Paul Ryan is starting to wane. While she's voted for him in the past, she's now undecided about doing it again. KRISTINE MOSER: I actually am kind of worried now about his viewpoints, and I don't know if it's because it was a broader audience or if he's morphed into his Mitt Romney. I'm not sure what's going on there, because he sounds different than how I've known him in the past. QUIRMBACH: That difference is what Rob Zerban is trying to exploit as he seeks to redefine Paul Ryan in his own TV ads. A Ryan poll last month showed him well ahead, but a poll by the Zerban campaign shows the contest still competitive. Challenger Rob Zerban says it's his goal to see Paul Ryan lose two elections in Wisconsin next month. For NPR News, I'm Chuck Quirmbach, in Milwaukee. Copyright \u00a9 2012 NPR.

Rick Berg, attend a North Dakota Chamber of Commerce forum in Bismarck last week.\n                \n                    \n                    Dale Wetzel/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption One of the races that could determine who controls the Senate next year is the surprisingly tight contest in North Dakota. Democratic Sen. Kent Conrad is retiring, and given the state's Republican leanings, it was assumed that the GOP candidate, first-term Rep. Rick Berg, would be a shoe-in to win the seat. But Democrat Heidi Heitkamp is tied with Berg, according to the most recent poll. One reason the race is close starts with a TV ad. It shows a freight train with a long line of oil tank cars running through the North Dakota prairie \u2014 tank cars that Heitkamp says are heading out of state: \"I'm Heidi Heitkamp, and in the Senate I'll fight to build another refinery in North Dakota,\" she says in the ad. \"It'll create jobs and help lower gas prices.\" An ad for Heidi Heitkamp's Senate campaign focuses on North Dakota's oil industry. It's a safe bet that few other Democrats running for the Senate this year are calling for construction of an oil refinery in their state, or charging that environmentalists are running the nation's energy policy, or are so openly critical of President Obama, as Heitkamp was at a Bismarck forum last week. \"I think the first thing that I say to the president is, 'You're wrong,' \" she said at the forum. \" 'You're wrong on energy. You're headed in the wrong direction. You made bad decisions. It is time for you to change your secretary of energy. It is time for you to get in the real world and give predictability.' \" Heitkamp is running in a state where an oil drilling boom has led to a 3 percent unemployment rate, the nation's lowest. It is also a place where President Obama has an approval rating of 37 percent, according to Gallup. So her advocacy of fossil fuels and criticism of the Obama administration is not just politically savvy \u2014 it's also a necessity. At that same forum, her Republican opponent, Berg, said criticizing the Obama administration isn't enough to change energy policies. He said it will take Republican control of the Senate \u2014 which would mean a new Senate majority leader to replace Democrat Harry Reid of Nevada. \"What I want to do is switch the majority leader in the Senate from someone that says they hate coal and oil to someone that's from a coal-producing state in Kentucky,\" Berg says. Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky is currently the top Republican in the Senate. As hard as Heitkamp is trying to distance herself from the Obama administration and its policies, Berg's campaign is trying to hang them on her. An anti-Heidi Heitkamp ad that has been running in North Dakota. One ad Republicans are running says: \"Let's just look at the facts. Obamacare: With over $700 billion in cuts to Medicare, Heidi is for it; Rick would repeal. Obama's higher taxes that could cost North Dakota jobs: Heidi would vote 'Yes'; Rick, 'No.' Trillions in new government spending: Heidi, for; Rick, against. You decide.\" Despite North Dakota's overwhelming Republican registration advantage, just two years ago both of the state's U.S. senators and its only congressman were Democrats. But after the 2010 election, the delegation became two-thirds Republican. University of North Dakota political science professor Mark Jendrysik says it will be tough for Heitkamp to buck the trend. \"I think it's a tall order for Heitkamp in that the built-in conservatism of the state and the recent Republican successes will make it hard to convince those people who are going to vote for [Republican presidential nominee Mitt] Romney to vote for her,\" Jendrysik says. \"But again, I think in North Dakota, party labels count for a lot less than: Do I like this person? Have I met this person? Do they come to the church picnic? Are they at the homecoming parade?\" At this past weekend's homecoming parade at the University of North Dakota in Grand Forks, both campaigns were out tossing candy and plastic footballs along the parade route. Among the spectators was Tom Wold, a retired lawyer from Fargo and a Berg supporter. \"It's important, in my opinion, that the Republicans control the Senate,\" Wold says. A little farther down the route stood Irene Melby, wearing a sticker supporting Heitkamp and watching her daughter march by in the band. \"I've liked Heidi for a long time, and I really hate negative ... stuff, and I've been a Democrat for a long time. So I almost have to, generally, go with the Democrat,\" Melby says. Both sides are spending millions of dollars in advertising, a rarity in the state. Berg hopes the state's GOP registration advantage will propel him to a win, while Heitkamp hopes what she calls North Dakota's notorious ticket splitters will come through for her.",

It's hardly surprising that Thursday night's vice presidential debate in Danville, Ky., would feature a spirited debate about Medicare. GOP vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan is the author of a controversial Medicare proposal that Democrats have been campaigning against for more than a year now. But fact checkers have raised some flags about some of the claims the candidates made. For example, here's Joe Biden, delivering the Democrats' favorite attack line against the GOP plan: \"Their ideas are old and their ideas are bad, and they eliminate the guarantee of Medicare.\" This is actually largely true. What Biden was using here is shorthand for the way Medicare is structured today, which is a guaranteed set of benefits that continue to be guaranteed no matter how much they cost. What Republican challenger Mitt Romney and Ryan are talking about is giving Medicare recipients a fixed amount of money instead, which might or might not be enough to pay for the benefits Medicare currently provides. So in that sense, the Republican plan does eliminate Medicare's current guarantee, although Medicare as a program would continue to exist. Ryan tried to insist that his Medicare plan is bipartisan. \"It's a plan I put together with a prominent Democrat senator from Oregon,\" he said. But while Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., did produce a policy paper with Ryan last December, it has not yet been turned into legislation that he can support. In fact, Wyden voted against the version of Ryan's House budget that came to the Senate floor this spring, and he took Romney to task when he named Wyden as a partner in the Medicare effort. Wyden was quick to respond again when Ryan tried to make him an ally during the debate. \"The Vice President is right,\" Wyden wrote in a post on his Facebook page. \"Romney Ryan moved the goal post on Medicare and I strongly oppose their plan because I believe it hurts seniors.\" Ryan didn't confine his health care claims to Medicare. He also struck out against the 2010 Affordable Care Act. \"Look at all the string of broken promises,\" he said. \"If you like your health care plan, you can keep it. Try telling that to the 20 million people who are projected to lose their health insurance if Obamacare goes through.\" This number, however, is one Republicans have been taking way out of context. It's the number the Congressional Budget Office says could no longer have employer-provided health insurance when the law is fully phased in, under the worst-case scenario. The more likely number is closer to 3 to 5 million, CBO says. Now, a lot of those people are likely to get insurance other ways, probably ways they will prefer. This includes people who are working solely to keep insurance; they may want to start their own business, or they may want to retire. Overall, the CBO says the law will boost the number of people with health insurance by about 30 million. Not all the misstatements were made by Ryan, however. For example, there was this comment from the vice president when Ryan complained about a panel that could potentially ration care: \"You know, I heard that death panel argument from Sarah Palin. It seems every vice presidential debate I hear this kind of stuff about panels.\" Except that while Palin was indeed active in complaining about \"death panels,\" that didn't start until the summer of 2009; nearly a year after her debate with Joe Biden. Biden also at one point suggested that under Ryan's budget, \"he will knock 19 million people off of Medicare.\" If Ryan looked a bit surprised by that, it's because the vice president most likely meant to say Medicaid, not Medicare.",

Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, participate in the vice presidential debate at Centre College in Danville, Ky., Thursday.\n                \n                    \n                    Charlie Neibergall/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Vice President Biden and his Republican opponent, Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, participate in the vice presidential debate at Centre College in Danville, Ky., Thursday. Neither candidate let his opponent get away with much of anything during the vice presidential debate Thursday night. The tabletop discussion between Vice President Biden and Republican Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin showcased their clear differences over policy. The two disagreed about nearly every issue that came up, whether it was military posture, tax policy or abortion. Many of these differences were expressed in negative, sometimes surprisingly personal terms. Ryan blamed the Obama administration for failing to do anything to address the nation's debt crisis, while Biden said Ryan bore much of the blame for deficits because he had voted to put two wars, the Medicare prescription drug benefit and sizable tax cuts \"on a credit card.\" Here are some of the main dynamics and moments that struck us: They Spoke To Their Bases, Not To The Middle Biden pushed back against Ryan in ways that President Obama failed to do against GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney in the first presidential debate last week. More than once, Biden brought up Romney's videotaped comments about the \"47 percent\" of Americans who lack personal responsibility. When it comes to entitlements, Biden said of the Republican ticket, \"Their ideas are old and their ideas are bad and they eliminate the guarantee of Medicare.\" For his part, Ryan laid the blame for continuing high unemployment and a sluggish economy straight at the White House doorstep. \"You have a president who ran four years ago promising hope and change who has now turned his campaign into attack, blame and defame,\" Ryan said. \"You see, if you don't have a good record to run on, then you paint your opponent as someone to run from.\" The Candidates Dominated Discussion, But The Moderator Mattered One question from the moderator, Martha Raddatz of ABC News, invited Ryan and Biden to decry the negativity of the campaigning. Instead, they engaged in more of it. Still, in contrast to last week's presidential debate, Raddatz managed to steer much of the discussion. She moved the discussion quickly through a number of complicated topics. She didn't challenge the substance of the candidate's responses, but she did press them to be more specific and, at times, to stick to the subject at hand. She even asked Biden to elucidate his euphemistic phrase, \"This is a bunch of stuff.\" He explained that it meant \"malarkey.\" But the job of challenging what a candidate meant by any particular statement fell, typically, to the opposing candidate. Neither Biden nor Ryan let many statements go unchallenged. For All Their Courtesy, Biden And Ryan Routinely Insulted Each Other There have been previous debates that featured candidates seated close together at a table in a format that seemed to minimize personal attacks and bombast. This wasn't one of those occasions. Throughout the debate, Ryan and Biden insulted each other in subtle and not so subtle ways. In true senatorial fashion, Biden referred several times to Ryan as \"my friend.\" But he didn't come across as a highly patient friend. \"I have never met two guys who are more down on America across the board,\" Biden said of the Republicans. At times, Biden not only challenged the veracity and consistency of Ryan's responses but seemed to be heckling him, interjecting phrases during Ryan's time such as \"that didn't happen,\" \"that's a bizarre statement\" and \u2014 shades of the 1988 vice presidential debate \u2014 \"Oh, now you're Jack Kennedy!\" Ryan, who referred repeatedly to Biden as \"Joe,\" may have come to the Centre College stage in Danville, Ky., with a couple of pointed lines prepared at the vice president's expense. But Biden may have topped one of them with an ad lib. Ryan tried to explain away Romney's comments about the 47 percent by alluding to Biden's own widely noted proclivity for gaffes, saying, \"I think the vice president very well knows that sometimes the words don't come out of your mouth the right way.\" Biden countered, \"But I always say what I mean, and so does Romney.\" A Debate About Defense Contained More Heat Than Light The last presidential debate, on Oct. 22, will focus on defense and foreign policy. Up to this point, however, the vice presidential discussion featured more substantive discussion of such issues than any other campaign event thus far. The two men seemed to express strong differences when it comes to levels of military spending and the U.S. posture toward countries including Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Syria and Iran. But when Ryan was pressed, he sometimes came up short in trying to explain how the Republicans would handle things differently than has the Democratic administration. On Syria, for example, Ryan complained that the Obama administration had wasted time by letting a U.N. envoy seek a deal with President Bashar Assad. It would have been better to work through allies in the region, he said, such as Turkey and Qatar to identify friendly forces within Syria. But he suggested that it would be a mistake to send in U.S. troops for humanitarian reasons. \"Putting American troops on the ground, that's got to be within the national security interests of the American people,\" Ryan said. It's Not Just What You Say. It's How You Say It It's become a truism of campaign debates that body language matters \u2014 that how the candidates appear with the sound off matters as much as the substance of their remarks. There was certainly a stark contrast between the two men in terms of demeanor. Biden seemed to have two main forms of expression \u2014 laughter and anger. At times, he was openly frustrated with Ryan's comments, flashing a broad, toothy smile and all but rolling his eyes. Biden looked alternately puzzled and bemused as he listened to Ryan's characterizations of Obama administration policies. Biden embraced his role as the elder statesman on the stage, unabashedly touting his own long record in Washington by saying on several occasions that \"I was there\" when big deals were made years or even decades ago on tax cuts and Social Security policy. Ryan was occasionally wonky, talking repeatedly about a \"status of forces agreement\" in regard to Iraq. Most of the time, however, he emphasized his Midwestern roots, referring to a friend from his hometown serving in Afghanistan, or having viewed the ultrasound image of his first child at the hospital where he himself had been born. Ryan was consistently calm, sober and unblinking, but occasionally he appeared to silently seethe at Biden's remarks, showing a pained, dimply half-smile as he waited for his chances to respond. At one point, he objected to Biden's heckling by saying, \"Mr. Vice President, I know you're under a lot of duress to make up for lost ground, but I think people would be better served if we don't keep interrupting each other.\"",

            "article_content": "As PolitiFact.com writes, \"the vice presidential debate Thursday night began on a somber note, then quickly turned to lively attacks \u2014 with both candidates stretching the truth.\" But in much the same way that neither candidate decisively won the debate, neither committed significantly bigger mistakes than the other in the fast-moving and spirited, 90-minute exchange. As expected, Vice President Biden and GOP vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan both crossed through some heavily disputed territory. They argued over the $716 billion in reduced Medicare spending that's part of the affordable health care law. And they traded barbs over whether the Republican ticket's plan for overhauling Medicare is a \"voucher\" program that would effectively replace the guaranteed benefit. NPR walked through those issues \u2014 and a few others \u2014 in advance of the debate. One of the freshest issues was the discussion of the attack on the consulate in Libya on Sept. 11. Early explanations from the White House focused on protests in response to an anti-Muslim YouTube video. Ryan challenged Biden on the question of why the consulate wasn't better protected, and Biden said the administration didn't know more security was needed. \"We weren't told they wanted more security,\" Biden said. \"We did not know they wanted more security there.\" But The Washington Post's Fact Checker responded quickly to that assertion. It pointed out that that Biden's claim had already been \"contradicted by State Department officials just the day before, in testimony before a congressional panel and in unclassified cables released by a congressional committee.\" On the same subject, Biden shot back at Ryan about \"this lecture\" on the issue of embassy security overseas. Biden noted, correctly as several news organizations reported immediately after the debate, that the House budget written by Ryan and the GOP proposed cuts that would have reduced security funding more than $300 million below the State Department's request. Additional funding was added during negotiations with the Democratic-led Senate. Later, during a long discussion about Syria in which Ryan pressed the case that the Obama administration hasn't handled the crisis properly, Biden and moderator Martha Raddatz pushed the Republican to explain what a Romney White House would do differently. The New York Times, in its fact-checking effort, concluded that in the end Ryan offered little to distinguish Romney's approach from what Obama is currently doing. Other things picked up by news outlets and independent fact checkers: -- PolitiFact.com notes that Ryan referred to the Obama health care program as a \"government takeover\" of health care. That's a Republican attack point that's been used for several years. In 2010, PolitiFact called \"government takeover of health care\" the \"lie of the year.\" -- FactCheck.org writes that \"Ryan says Obama turned Medicare into a 'piggy bank.' Not so.\" It has previously written that \"Republicans claim the president's $716 billion 'cuts' to Medicare hurt the program's finances. But the opposite is true. These cuts in the future growth of spending prolong the life of the Medicare trust fund, stretching the program's finances out longer than they would last otherwise.\" -- The Post's Fact Checker looked at Biden's statement that GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney once said General Motors should be allowed to go bankrupt. The Post writes that \"this statement is drawn from a headline \u2014 'Let Detroit Go Bankrupt' \u2014 on an opinion article written by Romney for the New York Times. But he did not say that in the article. (He repeated the line, however, on television.) Although 'bankrupt' often conjures up images of liquidation, Romney called for a 'managed bankruptcy.' This is a process in which the company uses the bankruptcy code to discharge its debts, but emerges from the process a leaner, less leveraged company.\" -- Ryan got dinged (including by National Journal) for a claim he continues to make despite evidence to the contrary. In defending his Medicare plan, Ryan says he has Democratic support from Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon. But Wyden has insisted for weeks now that while he did talk with Ryan about the Republican's ideas, he never endorsed them and, in fact, opposes what Ryan has proposed. The senator issued another statement Thursday evening saying that \"I believe the Romney/Ryan plan violates the Medicare guarantee and fails the test of bipartisanship.\" -- Biden misremembered one other thing during the debate. During the discussion about health care, he said, \"You know, I heard that death panel argument from Sarah Palin. It seems that every vice presidential debate, I hear this kind of stuff about panels.\" In fact, after going back to check the transcripts of the 2008 vice presidential debate, NPR's Julie Rovner confirms that \"death panels\" did not come up then. Palin didn't start talking about them until the following year. And she wasn't debating Biden then.",

Biden will be under pressure to shift the momentum back to the Democratic ticket. Ryan will be trying to keep it going in Mitt Romney's direction.  STEVE INSKEEPI, HOST: It's MORNING EDITION from NPR News. I'm Steve Inskeep. Good morning. RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: And I'm Renee Montagne. Tonight, it is the vice presidential candidates who face the audience for their first and only debate. Joe Biden will be under pressure to shift the momentum back to the Democratic ticket. Republican challenger, Paul Ryan, will be trying to keep that momentum going in Mitt Romney's direction. ABC's Martha Raddatz will be moderating the debate, which will be held in Danville, Kentucky. And NPR's national political correspondent, Mara Liasson, has this preview. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: This vice presidential debate could shatter the mold. TERRY HOLT: It's a rare thing, when so much hangs on the performance of a vice presidential debate. LIASSON: That's Republican strategist Terry Holt, who knows that vice presidential debates often produce memorable moments, like this one. SENATOR LLOYD BENTSEN: Senator, I served with Jack Kennedy. I knew Jack Kennedy. Jack Kennedy was a friend of mine. Senator, you're no Jack Kennedy LIASSON: But they don't often determine election results. Just ask Vice President Lloyd Bentsen, who delivered that famous line in his 1988 debate against Dan Quayle. Chris Lehane, a Democrat and former vice presidential aide, hopes tonight will be different. CHRIS LEHANE: Typically a vice presidential debate is watched more for the entertainment value than it is necessarily, you know, for its impact on the campaign. You know, I do think that this debate, you know, given where the race is and what happened last week with the debate, is going to be, you know, a debate that is followed. And that, you know, potentially can have an impact, depending on the performance of the two candidates. LIASSON: Joe Biden and Paul Ryan are a generation apart but they're both folksy Catholic pols who know their briefs. There is one difference. According to a new Pew poll, Biden is much less popular. He's viewed favorably by only 39 percent of those surveyed. Paul Ryan is viewed favorably by 44 percent. Here's the vice president on CBS News. VICE PRESIDENT JOSEPH BIDEN: All debates are tough, but I'm looking forward to it. I really am. The thing about Congressman Ryan is he's been straight forward up to now about everything he is - all the significant changes he wants to make. And we have a fundamentally different view on a whole range of issues. LIASSON: Those issues include Medicare, taxes, the deficit and social issues. Democrats expect Biden to be as aggressive on all of them tonight as President Obama was passive last week. Paul Ryan told Fox News Sunday, he expects Biden to come after him like a cannonball. REPRESENTATIVE PAUL RYAN: Don't forget, Joe Biden, he's been doing this for 40 years. He ran for president twice. He's a sitting vice president. He's been on this national stage more than anybody else in politics. They say that he won every single primary debate in 2008. So, believe you me, I understand this man is extremely experienced, he's a gifted speaker, he's a proven debater. So we definitely have our work cut out for us. LIASSON: That's standard pre debate handicapping, where your opponent is always more masterful than you are. But for Democrat Chris Lehane there's no escaping the fact that the pressure is on Joe Biden tonight. LEHANE: People are looking at this debate, from the Obama side, as is this going to be an opportunity to provide a fire break, in terms of where the campaign is right now. Does the Obama campaign, through the proxy of Vice President Biden, go back to the organizing principle that had really defined the campaign since the early summer? The Obama campaign's approach has been to keep their foot on the accelerator; to make this campaign a question about who are you going to trust more over the next four years? As opposed to are you better off than you were four years ago? LIASSON: The Obama campaign kept its foot on the accelerator by defining Romney early, with a relentless campaign of negative ads. But all of a sudden, last week at the debate in Denver, the foot came off the accelerator and the car started sliding back down the hill. That gave Republicans a big new jolt of confidence, says Terry Holt who believes tonight the bar for Ryan is much lower than it is for Biden. HOLT: We've seen an uptick in enthusiasm across the party, because Mitt Romney came out and demonstrated that he is a credible, safe, qualified alternative to President Obama. And so, tonight this is really more of a coming out for Paul Ryan. He doesn't have to shoot for the Moon. You know, Paul Ryan's main objective is to come across as a knowledgeable and credible spokesman for Mitt Romney. He doesn't have to hit it out of the park. LIASSON: But for the vice president, the opposite is true. He's being asked to do something that isn't usually on the list of vice presidential duties; to help repair the damage the top of the ticket has done to himself.

The White House wants to extend a federal wind energy credit, but the Romney campaign wants to let it expire.\n                \n                    \n                    Charlie Riedel/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Wind turbines dwarf a church near Wilson, Kan. The White House wants to extend a federal wind energy credit, but the Romney campaign wants to let it expire. When Vice President Joe Biden and U.S. Rep Paul Ryan face off during their only debate, tens of millions of Americans will tune in to hear them defend their running mates' records. And that audience Thursday night also will hear lots of budget-related buzzwords, with meanings that may not be entirely clear. Those words are shorthand for policies that could have huge impacts on taxpayers and the annual $1 trillion budget deficit. Brushing up on terms of the debate can help voters better understand what's really being said on the stage at Centre College in Kentucky. Even though vice presidents have no constitutional duties other than to break ties in the Senate, they often serve as key presidential advisers. And frequently, they end up serving as president themselves. Consider the odds: The country has had 44 presidents; nine of them have suddenly taken the presidential oath of office following the death or resignation of a president. Another five former vice presidents have gone on to be elected president. In other words, nearly a third of all presidents have had resumes that included time served as a vice president. Both Biden and Ryan are considered possible future presidential candidates. Here are some words they likely will use in their debate. In a budget debate, \"loophole\" typically refers to gray areas in the tax code. The ambiguity can be used to escape the intent of the law, without technically breaking it. For example, several years ago, Congress offered a tax break that was intended to help small businesses invest in heavy vehicles to upgrade their transportation fleets. The legislation's goal was to strengthen small business. But many small-business owners used the law not to expand fleets but to get a tax credit to buy an SUV for their personal use. During campaigns, politicians often say they will close loopholes to boost government revenues without raising tax rates. Besides being the GOP vice presidential candidate, Paul Ryan is chairman of the House Budget Committee. In that role, he has been pushing a plan to reduce the federal deficit by cutting spending. His plan would not balance the budget until 2040, but would reduce annual shortfalls. The most controversial feature involves changing Medicare to offer older Americans a menu of subsidized private insurance plans. Talking about the Ryan budget is usually a way to call attention to the proposed changes in Medicare and reductions in safety-net programs, such as the one offering food stamps. Wind energy has become a booming business, but a federal production tax credit expires at the end of the year. The White House wants to extend it, and the Romney campaign wants to let it expire. The issue reflects the opposing views on energy production: The Obama ticket wants special help to encourage alternatives to fossil fuels while the Romney ticket wants to end renewable-energy subsidies and boost competition among all energy producers.",

No more Mr. Nice Guy. That was essentially what President Obama told Tom Joyner, the black-radio megahost, to expect at upcoming presidential debates. On Wednesday, the president explained that his main mistake at last week's debate with Republican challenger Mitt Romney was an excess of gentility. Obama's self-critique, such as it was, came in response to a Joyner question: JOYNER: \"I only have two questions for you. One, what happened at the debate? Everybody wants to know. Or was that some kind of genius strategy to rope and dope him in and then fact check him at the end? Or, and the other question is for all of my, my black friends who say that the president's not doing nothing, not doing anything for the black community, talk to them.\" OBAMA: \"Well, two things. I mean, you know, the debate, I think it's fair to say I was just too polite because, you know, it's hard to sometimes just keep on saying and what you're saying isn't true. It gets repetitive. But, you know, the good news is, is that's just the first one. Gov. Romney put forward a whole bunch of stuff that either involved him running away from positions that he had taken, or doubling down on things like Medicare vouchers that are going to hurt him long term.\" That was the president's most obvious bit of public navel-gazing since his dubious performance at his first presidential debate with Romney, which left many of his supporters stunned. But Obama promised that he'd come out swinging, sort of, at the next debate, scheduled for Tuesday. OBAMA: \"And, you know, I think it's fair to say that we will see a little more activity at the next one. ... We've got four weeks left in the election. And we're going to take it to him. Moments later, Joyner suggested that Obama's supporters had probably grown comfortable, presumably because of the president's widening lead in some pre-debate polls, and that the debate and its aftermath was jarring. Obama said his supporters should have never been comfortable. OBAMA: \"This is always going to be a close race. The fact of the matter is, is that if people were comfortable they didn't recognize we've just gone through four really tough years.\" His campaign always thought the race could be a squeaker, he said. OBAMA: \"And, you know, Gov. Romney kept on making mistakes month after month so it made it look artificially like this was, might end up being a cakewalk. But we understood internally that it never would be. That it was going to be tight, it tightened over the last three or four days, but it could have tightened after the convention if they hadn't had such a bad convention.\" While that seemed like a reasonable explanation for why his supporters may have started to get comfortable, it didn't really explain why the president himself appeared in that first debate to lack the \"fierce urgency of now\" to use the words of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. that Obama often quoted in 2008. Obama also sounded a bit like the Muhammad Ali of old, almost guaranteeing wins in upcoming debates \u2014 both Vice President Biden's face-off with Republican Paul Ryan on Thursday, and his own next two encounters with Romney. OBAMA: \"So people just have to make sure that they stay focused and I guarantee you we've got, you know, Biden I think will be terrific in the debate this week.\" JOYNER: \"Uh-huh.\" OBAMA: \"I've got another debate on Tuesday of next week.\" JOYNER: \"Yeah.\" OBAMA: \"And by next week I think a lot of the hand wringing will be complete because we're going to go ahead and win this thing.\" The Joyner interview could certainly be seen as a form of damage control as the president continues to get past a debate that Romney was seen as winning by a wide margin. In the debate, Obama seemed mostly incapable of effectively rebutting his challenger and presenting an inspiring case for his re-election. It was also part of the president's get-out-the-vote strategy to the most loyal voters in his Democratic base, African-Americans. If past is prelude, then Obama should get more than 90 percent of African-American voters. The question is how large will the denominator be? Just how many black voters will actually turn out?",

Slate Magazine's John Dickerson says likeability doesn't matter as much in a presidential campaign as you might think.\n                \n                    \n                    Jewel Samad/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption William Lowndes was a congressman from South Carolina who served in the early part of the 19th century. He was once asked to describe who should serve as chief executive. \"The presidency is not an office to be either solicited or declined,\" he said. In 1876, Rutherford B. Hayes didn't even vote for himself. He saw it as unseemly. And in 1916, Woodrow Wilson called campaigning \"a great interruption to the rational consideration of public questions.\" John Dickerson of Slate Magazine just wrote an extensive series on how we evaluate presidential candidates and the problems with it. \"For the first, really, hundred years of American history, the presidency was the kind of thing that no man who actively sought it was worth the job,\" Dickerson says. \"Now we've turned it totally on its head.\" Dickerson says that early on in American politics, the candidates were essentially picked by the political elites, and it was the elites who knew who the men were who were running for president. \"They judged them based on their interactions with them, their sense of honor, and character, and they put them forward,\" Dickerson says. Nowadays, Dickerson contends, nobody would want to go back to that kind of system because it allows for all kinds of corruption. We've made a shift, he says, to the importance of a public presentation of the presidency. \"As you move into the television age you start to have candidates who are appealing and powerful in the moment, in the presentation of themselves,\" he says. \"That puts a greater emphasis on the public person, which is a very important part of the presidential role, but not the whole bundle, and we don't pay too much attention to all of the other important parts of the presidency.\" The way we measure our presidential candidates these days is a complicated formula. Mo Fiorina, a professor of political science at Stanford University and a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution, has researched the correlation between likeability and winning the White House. He says the common cliche that the more likeable candidate always wins isn't the case. \"There's very little historical evidence for it,\" he says. After looking at research back to 1952 that evaluated how people evaluated candidates in personal terms, Fiorina says likeability \"appeared to be a minor factor. The fact is we decide who is likeable after they win, not before they win.\" Does that mean the likeability gap between Mitt Romney and President Obama is irrelevant? Fiorina thinks so. \"If I had been advising Mitt Romney, I would have said in the end the American people are not going to decide who they are going to have a beer with, because the American people know that they are not going to have a beer with any of these people,\" he says. \"They are going to decide on the base of who they know is going to do the job.\" Dickerson says that \"to do the job\" and to get anything done requires a president to make deals and \"be malleable\". But the whole concept of making a deal is \"something you never want to admit to\" on the campaign trail. \"When you're on the campaign trail, everything is always in super black and white,\" he says. So what's key to a candidate is \"to know when to take a good deal, and the best possible deal, to actually get something done and make progress, rather than being so resolved that nothing gets done.\"",

'She died 3 days b4 he became president'.\" The company followed with a message expressing its \"Deepest apologies for an irresponsible tweet that is in no way a representation of the brand's opinion.\" Then Cynthia Soledad, KitchenAid's senior director, added tweets saying: -- \"I would like to personally apologize to President @BarackObama, his family and everyone on Twitter for the offensive tweet sent earlier.\" -- \"It was carelessly sent in error by a member of our Twitter team who, needless to say, won't be tweeting for us anymore.\" NBC News adds that: \"In a statement, Soledad said an employee intending to Tweet the comment from a personal Twitter account mistakenly sent it from the company's account instead.

My grandparents did. My grandfather died awhile back. My grandmother died three days before I was elected president. And she was fiercely independent. She worked her way up, only had a high school education, started as a secretary, ended up being the vice president of a local bank. And she ended up living alone by choice. And the reason she could be independent was because of Social Security and Medicare. She had worked all her life, put in this money and understood that there was a basic guarantee, a floor under which she could not go. \"And that's the perspective I bring when I think about what's called entitlements. You know, the name itself implies some sense of dependency on the part of these folks. These are folks who've worked hard, like my grandmother.

A question of style?\n                \n                    \n                    AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Romney vs. Obama. A question of style? If you think substance trumps style, the analysis of last night's presidential debate might come as a shock. There seems to be a lot more talk today about things like temperament and facial expressions than the facts. Here's a sampling of opinion: Writing in Forbes, Frederick E. Allen says President Obama \"looked defensive and uncertain,\" while GOP challenger Mitt Romney \"may have said things that were clearly untrue ... but he said them convincingly.\" The Washington Post said: \"Obama's facial expressions seemed to alternate between grimly looking down at his podium and smirking when Romney said something with which he disagreed.\" The Chicago Tribune quoted an Obama supporter, Karl Amelchenko, as saying that \"unfortunately\" he thought Romney had won the debate because the GOP candidate was \"aggressive. He attacked.\" And, Reuters tracked down Janine Driver, president of something called the Body Language Institute (uh yes, really) to opine that, \"With regard to body language, Mitt Romney was the winner.\" The much-quoted CNN/ORC International poll shows a whopping 67 percent of those who watched the debate thought the president got the worst of it. Clearly, it seems, you've got to chalk one up for Romney on the question of style. Contrast that with the facts (or lack thereof), and the two candidates come off looking a bit more evenly matched. \"From just out of the gate, then throughout the debate, the sense of urgency that Mitt Romney brought to his task last night was important,\" says Mitchell McKinney, who teaches political communication at the University of Missouri. \"That contrasted with a deliberative, almost halting approach on Obama's part,\" he says. \"When you compare urgency to this halting demeanor, then Obama comes off as not prepared.\" \"Obama's nonverbal cues mirrored his reluctance to verbally confront Romney's attacks,\" McKinney says. Michael Shanahan, a professor at George Washington University's School of Media and Public Affairs, says the debates are \"not about the facts, they are about establishing impressions.\" \"The arguments over taxes and Obamacare are too much for most people to absorb,\" he says. \"What people are looking for is how the candidate looks, whether he looks like a leader, and whether he looks like a president.\" Last night, Obama was definitely \"off his game,\" Shanahan says. \"I don't know what Obama's people were telling him, but my sense is they wanted him to appear reserved and in control. It wasn't a good strategy, in my opinion.\" There were plenty of times, too, when Obama missed the opportunity to refute his opponent's arguments, such as the claim that the Affordable Care Act cut $716 billion from Medicare, something fact checkers, at best, have labeled a half-truth. But the fact checking that comes after the fact doesn't do much good, says McKinney. The audience for the debate was far greater than the number of people who pay attention to websites such as FactCheck.org  and PolitiFact. \"During a debate, the best fact checker is the opponent, and on that score, the president really fell down,\" McKinney says. Will the debate dent the polling numbers?: \"One debate does not a president make,\" he says. \"But what we've found is that if one candidate can string together a series of strong performances, they can turn things in their favor.\"",

We headed to Virginia's Prince William County, a swing county in a swing state, to watch Wednesday night's presidential debate with four undecided voters \u2014 three of whom voted for Barack Obama in 2008, one who voted for Republican John McCain. They gathered in the Occoquan home of Kim Deal and Jim Drakes, and were joined by Connie Moser of Dale City and Al Alborn of Manassas. The consensus of the group was that Republican Mitt Romney won the debate, putting together a more \"focused and sincere\" performance, Moser said, adding: \"The president seemed to be struggling to make his point.\" One thing that struck the watchers \u2014 and through the entire 90-minute debate \u2014 was Obama's demeanor, which they described as distracted, tired and, at times, dour. \"The stagecraft wasn't there,\" Alborn said. \"Obama's the smarter guy and said a lot of stuff I like. But Romney had wonderful stagecraft, and for older guys like me, his closing looked like Reagan.\" Obama failed to adequately explain what he's been doing these past four years, Drakes said, with the exception of the list of accomplishments he provided at the end of the event. Romney was fervent, they said; Obama was in the weeds. \"Both looked presidential,\" Alborn said, \"but Romney walked away with more because Romney's not the president. He had more to gain, and he gained it. Obama had more to lose, and he lost it.\" A surprise? No mention of Romney's \"47 percent\" comments. The night's big loser, though? The moderator, PBS anchor Jim Lehrer, who wielded little control over the proceeding. \"If I had to vote here, Lehrer would be off the island,\" Drakes said. We talked to our debate watchers before the debate, and then asked for more detailed individual responses after the debate. Here's more about our participants, and their debate thoughts: Kim Deal, 42, a systems engineer/program manager for a defense contractor Deal, who voted for McCain in 2008, said before the debate that she hasn't seen anything compelling enough yet from either candidate to win her vote. And she's not even sure she'll vote for either of them in November. \"I'm very frustrated with both candidates, and I have to say with the parties as well,\" she says. \"I'd love to have a 'none of the above.' \" Going into the debate, Deal said she wanted to hear \"some fiscal conservatism,\" and more details on the health care overhaul legislation. \"Obamacare is an interesting concept,\" she says, \"but how are states going to pay for it?\" Her pre-debate impression was that Obama is \"more relaxed in his own skin\" than Romney. On the debate: \"The biggest moment for me was when Romney was talking about drilling for oil and supporting coal. It made me clinch. That's not something we're going to get back; when it's gone, it's gone. That was disturbing to me. Of the four people here, I'm the least political. I've heard before that they were very similar, and it occurred to me that they are. \"I do still feel that Obama, by using specific examples from his life, like his grandmother, it did hit home that his life is much more similar to my life. My parents are 80, on Social Security, on Medicare, live together in their own home. But it's a concern of mine. We don't have enough money if something happened to my parents, or Jim's mom. I'm convinced no matter who I vote for I'm going to get the same kind of deal \u2014 except drilling. If I had to base it on tonight, I'd vote for Obama because of that.\" Jim Drakes, 48, physicist with a defense contractor Drakes voted for Obama in 2008, and still likes him. But before the debate he says that Romney may be a better person to address the nation's debt and deficit issues because he might be tougher making cuts. Jim Drakes of Occoquan, Va.\n                \n                    \n                    Liz Halloran/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Jim Drakes of Occoquan, Va. \"Obama is very much, it seems, a compassionate man, someone I would want in the White House,\" Drakes says. \"It's not just about the numbers \u2014 he can see further than the next fiscal quarter. \"But that can be a drawback at times, too,\" he said. \"Romney brings realism to the table, and I think he would be more effective in the near-term getting debt and spending under control.\" On the debate: \"I think Romney did a great job of putting the economic numbers in place, and forcefully projecting his economic position. The president really stumbled explaining to the American people how he's going to generate jobs. Romney did, and that will resonate with people in Ohio and Florida. \"The difficulty is it's always easy to say those things. Obama's had the problem of having to deal with this. I think the president's responses were quite disappointing. I would like to see him display more energy about why he wants to be president. It looked like he was running a staff meeting. He needed a much more forceful projection. He didn't make clear what he's accomplished.\" Connie Moser, 59, community activist from Dale City Moser voted for Obama in 2008, but says she's concerned about the state of the economy. Connie Moser of Dale City, Va.\n                \n                    \n                    Liz Halloran/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Connie Moser of Dale City, Va. \"It seems like things have progressively gotten worse, economy wise, and with the debt,\" Moser said before the debate. \"I really don't think it has to do with one politician \u2014 it's the ideas that we're using that aren't working.\" She questioned the stimulus program, and its effect on the national debt. \"It sounded good when we started, but do you ever watch the debt clock?\" she said, adding: \"But here's where the wiffle waffle comes in \u2014 I have seen economists say we needed that stimulus. But I'm a person who doesn't owe anyone anything. \"It's not compatible with my core feelings.\" She went into the debate leaning toward Romney, but said she's willing to listen to what they say in the debates. \"I appreciate that the candidates are wiling to undergo such an ordeal,\" she said. On the debate: \"I just don't feel like I'm any closer to a decision. It felt like a lot of give-and-take. There were some points that each candidate made that appealed to me, and points each made that made me cringe. \"When Romney talked about freedom to choose your school, he's talking about Title I-funded schools [those that have 35 percent or more of their students as disadvantaged or at risk]. In Dale City we have one, and over the last four years they've lost 300 students. Parents pulled them out because it's a Title I school. I think that's all backwards. Also, Romney likes coal, and I didn't like that.\" Al Alborn, 64, is retired from the military after 22 years, and then worked in the defense industry until retiring in 2002. He describes himself as a small-government libertarian, and voted for Obama in 2008. Al Alborn of Manassas, Va.\n                \n                    \n                    Liz Halloran/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Al Alborn of Manassas, Va. \"If I had to vote today, I'd vote for Romney,\" Alborn said before the debate. \"But I haven't scratched Obama off completely. \"I was surprised I voted for him last time \u2014 I bought into the hope and change, and also did not like the way McCain picked his running mate [Sarah Palin],\" he said. \"We do need a health care solution, and I thought [Obama] would put together a coalition,\" he said. \"Lyndon Johnson, people from the old guard, knew how to cross into the center, and I get the impression that Obama lacks those skills. \"There's also the possibility that the vestige of racism in the country hurt him,\" Alborn said. On the debate: \"I voted for Obama because we needed a health care solution. Tonight he came across as a very smart guy. But I think Romney did a wonderful job defending against the Democratic Party campaign rhetoric about what he intends to do. He came off very Reaganesque. And for seniors, he went out of his way to defend Medicare. I liked how he talked about working across party lines in Massachusetts. I need to listen to foreign policy because that's a big issue for me. \"If I had to vote today, I've vote for Romney. But I don't have to vote today. I'm looking forward to foreign policy debate \u2014 I would prefer to see our military budget focused on defense, not offense. There's a lot of waste out there, systems pushed by congressmen. We're buying weapon systems that the secretary of defense doesn't want. Romney is buying into that. The use of the military is a failure in foreign policy.\"",

President Obama and his Republican challenger, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, engaged Thursday night in a sometimes spirited, but always cordial, debate that got very technical at times. It was the \"corporate executive\" (Romney) vs. the \"government professor\" (Obama) and the GOP nominee appeared to be \"full of confidence and full of sales pitch,\" NPR Senior Washington Editor Ron Elving says, while Obama put pressure on the Republican to explain what he would do as president. There were few memorable lines \u2014 Romney at one point labeled Obama's policies \"trickle down government\" and Obama said Romney's plans for tax cuts would leave average Americans \"picking up the tab.\" But overall, it wasn't an affair full of \"zingers.\" Instead, the two contenders tossed around numbers \u2014 Obama said Romney would cut taxes for the wealthy by $5 trillion and Romney said Obama would cut Medicare funding by $716 billion \u2014 that they each disputed. Will the debate at the University of Denver, the first of three in coming weeks, change the dynamics of what appears to be a very tight battle for the White House? NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson said afterward that as of this evening, there wasn't any reason to think the debate would change the race. But that could change in coming days as pundits weigh in and as video clips start circulating. We live blogged as they debated at the University of Denver. The moderator was Jim Lehrer of the PBS NewsHour. Update at 10:35 p.m. ET. In Closing, Two Different \"Paths\": Obama, as determined beforehand, gave the first closing statement. He ran through some of the things accomplished the last four years, including the end of the war in Iraq and the killing of Osama bin Laden. And he said that among the promises he made four years ago was that he \"wouldn't be a perfect president ... but would fight every day\" to do what's right. \"I've kept that promise,\" he said, and promised to do so again if he's re-elected. Romney said he and the president would take the nation on \"two paths that lead in very different directions.\" And if you look at Obama's record, Romney said, the path the president would take the nation would likely lead to weak job growth, cuts in Medicare and \"dramatic cuts to our millitary.\" Update at 10:25 p.m. ET. Romney Says Federal Government Has Role To Play In Education; Obama Says \"Budgets Matter\"; Romney Raps Obama's Priorities: The Republican nominee says he agrees with some of the things the Obama administration has been doing on education. Obama responds that Romney's tax cuts for \"folks like me and him\" would force a 20 percent cut in federal education spending. To which Romney says he would not cut education funding and criticizes the Obama administration for putting \"$90 billion into green jobs. That would have hired 2 million teachers.\" Update at 10:15 p.m. ET. Romney Cites Reagan As A Model For How To Govern: Obama says Romney isn't giving Americans enough details about the policies he would pursue. Romney responds that \"my experience as a governor is that if I come in and lay down a piece of legislation and say 'it's my way or the highway,' \" not much gets done. He would emulate Ronald Reagan, who \"laid out his principles\" and then worked with Congress. Update at 10:10 p.m. ET. Romney Pushes To Repeal \"Obamacare\"; Obama Says It Was Modeled After Romney's Effort In Massachusetts: After Romney makes his case for why \"Obamacare\" should be repealed \u2014 focusing on what he says are too-high costs and an \"unelected board that's going to tell people ultimately what kind of treatments they can have\" \u2014 Obama says \"we've seen this model work really well, in Massachusetts, because Gov. Romney did a good thing working with Democrats in the state.\" Romney responds that Obama didn't work across party lines, but instead came up with a plan \"that you and Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid thought was the best idea.\" To which Obama says that his plan originally was bipartisan, but it was Republicans in Congress who chose to not work with his administration. \"Democrats in Massachusetts might have given Republicans in Congress some advice on how to cooperate,\" Obama says. The president also disputes the charge that an unelected board will tell people what treatments they can have. It will be \"health care experts\" trying to \"figure out how we can reduce the cost of health care,\" he says. \"This board ... can't make decisions about what treatments are given,\" Obama adds. \"It's prohibited in this law.\" Update at 9:55 p.m. ET. Sharp Differences On Medicare Policies: Obama begins a discussion of entitlements by talking of his grandmother, who was able to remain independent at the end of her life because, he says, \"of Social Security and Medicare.\" Romney, looking to reassure seniors that he wouldn't do anything to affect them, says \"neither the president nor I are proposing any changes for current retirees.\" But Obama, Romney says in a repeat of things he's said many times before, would reduce benefits for future retirees by \"cutting $716 billion from the program.\" Obama, who has previously said his cuts would not affect retirees, counters that the \"voucher plan\" favored by GOP vice presidential nominee Rep. Paul Ryan would \"cost the average senior about $6,000 a year.\" PolitiFact has previously said the charge that Obama would \"funnel\" $716 billion out of Medicare at the expense of the elderly is \"mostly false.\" The charge that Ryan's plan would raise costs for Medicare beneficiaries by $6,000 each is \"half true,\" PolitiFact says. Update at 9:40 p.m. ET. Romney Points To Broken Pledges; Obama Talks Of Being Balanced: Romney takes the president to task for promising to cut the budget deficit in half, but instead being in the Oval Office as annual deficits grew to more than $1 trillion. Obama, meanwhile, faults Romney for saying during the GOP primaries that he wouldn't accept $1 in higher taxes in exchange for $10 worth of spending cuts. There has to be a balance between raising revenue and cutting spending, the president says. Romney responds that \"you'll never balance the budget by raising taxes.\" The way to do it, he says, is to reduce tax rates so that job growth resumes and more people are paying taxes. After the president says that some corporations can get tax deductions for moving jobs overseas, Romney \u2014 citing his business experience \u2014 says, \"I have no idea what you're talking about. ... I may need to get a new accountant.\" Update at 9:30 p.m. ET. More Dispute Over Taxes: The president says again that Romney wants to \"cut taxes by $5 trillion and add $2 trillion in spending that the military is not asking for.\" If the American people think that can be done and they won't end up \"picking up the tab ... then Gov. Romney's plan is the one for you,\" he says. Romney says, again, that \"I'm not in favor of a $5 trillion tax cut. ... That's not my plan.\" He wants to \"bring down rates ... but also bring down deductions at the same time.\" Update at 9:19 p.m. ET. Differences On Job Creation, Taxes: The first question from Lehrer is about jobs. \"What are the major differences between the two of you about how you would go about creating jobs?\" Obama first says the most important point he wants to make is that \"20 years ago I became the luckiest man on Earth because Michelle Obama agreed to marry me.\" He then goes on to say that four years ago the nation was facing the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. He cites the creation of about 5 million jobs since he took office. But more work needs to be done, he says. Romney, says Obama, believes that cutting taxes alone will get the economy moving. \"I think we've got to invest in education and training\" and take other steps, Obama says. Voters, he says in a reference to GOP positions, need to decide whether they want to \"double down on the policies that got us into the mess.\" Romney begins by congratulating the Obamas on their wedding anniversary, and jokes that \"this was obviously the most romantic place you could imagine ... Here with me.\" Then Romney begins drawing differences with the president. \"It's going to take a different path\" to boost job growth, he says. \"My plan has five basic parts\": Energy independence. More trade. Training. A balanced budget. And \"championing small business.\" \"The path we've been on is just not successful,\" says Romney, calling Obama's plan \"trickle down government.\" Asked by Lehrer to address the president directly, Romney disputes Obama's claim that the GOP candidate has a $5 trillion tax cut plan. \"I don't,\" he says. And he tells Obama that \"middle income families are being crushed.\" Romney continues on taxes, saying, \"I'm not looking to cut massive taxes and reduce the revenues to the government. ... There will be no tax cut that adds to the deficit.\" Obama says that \"Gov. Romney's proposal ... calls for a $5 trillion tax cut. ... He is saying he's going to pay for it by closing loopholes and deductions. ... He's been asked more than 100 times how he's going to pay for them\" and hasn't been able to answer. \"Virtually everything he just said about my tax plan is inaccurate,\" Romney responds. \"I will not reduce the taxes paid by high-income Americans,\" Romney adds, after joking that as the father of five boys he's used to having someone say something many times even if it's just not true in the hope that it will be believed. \"For 18 months he's been running on this tax plan and now, five weeks before the election he's saying his big, bold idea is 'nevermind,' \" Obama says. It's impossible, he says, to enact Romney's plans without either increasing the deficit or raising taxes on the middle class. Watch for this discussion to be among the several that fact checkers pay close attention to. Update at 8:55 p.m. ET. Lehrer Tells Audience To \"Sit On It!\": Adding to the earlier warning about not making noise during the debate, Lehrer just instructed the crowd that \"if you hear something that's really terrific, sit on it! If you hear something you don't like, sit on it!\" He jokingly asked first lady Michelle Obama and Ann Romney, wife of the GOP nominee, to enforce the rules on each of their sides. Update at 8:45 p.m. ET. No Cheering, Please, Audience Is Told: With \"50 to 100 million\" Americans watching tonight, \"it's wrong for us to intrude on them,\" debate commission Co-Chairman Frank Fahrenkopf just told the several thousand people in attendance. \"So please, don't clap, don't cheer, don't make any noise.\" He also asked those in the building to turn off their cellphones. \"Hopefully, we can live for 90 minutes without these things on,\" Fahrenkopf said. Fahrenkopf is a former chairman of the Republican National Committee. The other commission co-chairman is Mike McCurry, one-time press secretary to Democratic President Bill Clinton. Update at 8:35 p.m. ET. What Does Each Man Need To Do? On All Things Considered today, NPR's Mara Liasson said the conventional wisdom holds that Romney \"has the bigger task.\" He needs, she said, to \"criticize the president without looking too harsh or negative.\" And Romney must \"show how his economic policies can make people's lives better in the future.\" One advantage Romney has, Mara said, is that he comes in \"as an underdog.\" So the expectations are lower for the Republican. President Obama, she said, must \"avoid a mistake ... [and] not come off as smug or arrogant or thin-skinned.\" As for how important the debates may be, Mara said it's \"hard to find an example since the Kennedy-Nixon debates\" in 1960 when they appeared to significantly affect the outcome of an election. But in a race that's likely to be \"decided by a hair,\" said Mara, \"little things really do matter\" and a good or bad debate performance could be important. Update at 8:25 p.m. ET: What's The Format? What Are The Topics? According to the Commission on Presidential Debates, tonight's debate will be divided into \"six segments of approximately 15 minutes each. ... The moderator will open each segment with a question, after which each candidate will have two minutes to respond. The moderator will use the balance of the time in the segment for a discussion of the topic.\" A coin toss has determined that President Obama will get the first question. Romney will get the last word before the debate ends. Domestic policy is the overall topic tonight. Lehrer has announced that he plans to focus on the economy in the first three segments. After that, he plans to move to health care, \"the role of government,\" and \"governing.\" As The Christian Science Monitor notes, in past years \"debates have typically had more questions and shorter discussion times. Lehrer, in part, advocated for the new format, and pushed to reduce the number of questions from nine to six, in the hopes that it would encourage more of a television talk-show approach, in which the candidates engage in discussion rather than just deliver talking points.\" The other presidential debates will be on Oct. 16 (a town hall format) and Oct. 22. The one debate between Vice President Biden and his GOP challenger, Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, is set for Oct. 11.",

Voting booths were set up for early voting Thursday at the Black Hawk County Courthouse in Waterloo, Iowa. Ahead of Wednesday's first presidential debate, an NPR poll finds President Obama with a 7-point lead nationally, but his GOP challenger, Mitt Romney, is within striking distance. The latest poll by NPR and its bipartisan polling team [pdf] shows President Obama with a 7-point lead among likely voters nationally and a nearly identical lead of 6 points in the dozen battleground states where both campaigns are spending most of their time and money. I know it's a long way off, but thinking about the presidential election this November, if the election for president were held today and the candidates were \u2014 Democrat Barack Obama and Republican Mitt Romney, for whom would you vote? Source: NPR/Democracy Corps/Resurgent Republic Credit: Padmananda Rama and Alyson Hurt / NPR But the poll also finds former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney very much within striking distance of the incumbent as the two men begin a series of three debates Wednesday in Denver. More than 80 percent of respondents said they planned to watch the first televised clash Wednesday and one in four said the debate could influence their vote. Do you intend to watch the first presidential debate next Wednesday night? If Yes: Is that all of the debate, some, or will you try to catch portions of it on the news? Source: NPR/Democracy Corps/Resurgent Republic Credit: Padmananda Rama and Alyson Hurt / NPR The poll found 51 percent of the likely voters planning on or leaning toward a vote for the president, with 44 percent voting for or leaning toward his challenger. In the battleground subsample, the numbers were 50 percent Obama and 44 percent Romney. Those numbers were slightly better for the president than his job approval rating in the poll. Nationally, the president was at 50 percent approval (46 percent disapproval), but in the battleground he was at 48 percent approval and 49 percent disapproval. Battleground voters were also more downbeat about the direction of the country. Asked whether things were generally going in the right direction or \"pretty seriously off on the wrong track,\" 59 percent in the battleground said wrong track and just 36 percent said right direction. That gap of 23 points was only 16 points on the same question in the national sample. The poll of 800 likely voters was conducted over the final five days of September by Stan Greenberg of Democracy Corps and Whit Ayres of Resurgent Republic. About a third of those polled live in the 12 states considered in play for the Nov. 6 election: Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Michigan, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Wisconsin. Ayres, the Republican half of the team, noted that the actual electorate in November may not have as many Democrats as this NPR poll's likely voter sample, which he called \"a best-case scenario\" for the president's party. \"When you sample voters over time, you inevitably get varying proportions of Democrats and Republicans in the sample. It's nothing nefarious, just the vagaries of sampling,\" Ayres said. \"This sample ended up with seven points more Democrats than Republicans. In 2008, there were seven points more Democrats than Republicans in the electorate, according to exit polls. But in 2004, there were equal numbers of Democrats and Republicans.\" If this year's voters were to split evenly again between the two major parties, Romney would have an advantage. The NPR poll found him a 4-point favorite among independents. Most observers expect this year's party ratio to be somewhere between the Democratic tilt of 2008 and the even split of 2004 (which recurred in the midterm elections of 2010). Greenberg, the Democratic member of the polling team, said polling this year has generally found fewer people self-identifying with the GOP. \"They're moving into the independent category,\" Greenberg said, \"where also if you look at the brand position of the Republican Party and Democratic Party, the Republican Party favorability has been dropping throughout this whole period.\" But while the ranks of independents are growing, that does not imply a large number of undecided voters with five weeks left to Election Day. The pollsters found only 2 percent calling themselves undecided. Moreover, 11 percent of those who do not support the president said they might still change their minds. Fifteen percent of those who do not support Romney say the same. \"We have a very polarized electorate where people go to their tribal corners and fight it out,\" Ayres said. \"But in an election this close, even a point or two could make a difference.\" Now, thinking about the nation's economy, do you believe the economy... Source: NPR/Democracy Corps/Resurgent Republic Credit: Padmananda Rama and Alyson Hurt / NPR The poll indicates that the Republican challenger has a tall order to fill Wednesday night and in the remaining weeks, as he has fallen behind on issues such as taxes, the economy and Medicare. Ayres said that means his party's nominee needs \"to paint a compelling picture for a better economic future, and explain why his emphasis on small businesses and private sector solutions is more likely to succeed than Obama's emphasis on governmental and public sector solutions.\" Ayres also noted that when his firm tested the statement \"Obama's economic plan is working and we need to stay the course\" versus the opposing option, \"Obama's economic plan is not working and we need to try something different,\" the latter choice was easily the more popular. But when the statements were altered to emphasize Romney's video quotation about \"the 47 percent who don't pay taxes,\" the results were different. In the election this year, do you plan on voting on Election Day on November 6th or do you plan to vote early or absentee prior to Election Day? Source: NPR/Democracy Corps/Resurgent Republic Credit: Padmananda Rama and Alyson Hurt / NPR \"That reinforces the argument that Obama cannot win a referendum on his economic record,\" Ayres added. \"The only way he can win is to so thoroughly trash Romney that he becomes an unacceptable alternative.\" The NPR poll, like others in recent weeks, showed half the electorate giving Romney an unfavorable personal approval rating. Ayres said that was the other imperative for Romney in the debates: \"He needs to come across as knowledgeable and compassionate about people who are hurting in this economy. ... If he does that, then he will help to close this gap.\" Democratic pollster Greenberg maintained that efforts to make the election a referendum on the economy had been under way for months and had yet to take hold. Nonetheless, he said, the president cannot afford to sit on his current lead. \"He's got to decide on one thing that he wants to communicate here,\" Greenberg said. \"My guess is he'll want to communicate a presidential \u2014 but not arrogant \u2014 empathetic style. He's got to focus in a way that seals the deal.\"",

At least 200 people had arrived within the first hour.\n                \n                    \n                    Sarah McCammon/Iowa Public Radio\n                    \n                \nhide caption Iowans vote Thursday at the Polk County Auditor's Office in Des Moines. Voters lined up before the doors opened at 8 a.m. to cast ballots. At least 200 people had arrived within the first hour. Early in-person voting has begun in Iowa, the first swing state to open polling sites. Residents of the battleground state can now vote in person at their local county auditors' offices or turn them in by mail. Some areas will offer additional satellite locations. At the Polk County Auditor's office in downtown Des Moines Thursday morning, a line of voters stretched down the block as the door opened. Peter Clay, 62, was among the many supporters of President Obama. He says he's volunteered for the campaign on his days off from his job as a zookeeper. \"It's important to have a lot of folks showing up today because it shows there's passion and energy in this campaign,\" Clay says. \"This is our first chance to show how much we care about the outcome and to demonstrate we want this president in office for another four years.\" Democrats also seemed to dominate as Johnson County opened its polls in Iowa City. Victoria Walton, a librarian in Iowa City and an Obama supporter, says she doesn't see any reason to hold off until Election Day. \"I'm very concerned about the election, and wanted to place my vote as soon as possible,\" she says. \"I've already decided and the debates are not going to change my mind in any way. I've been listening carefully and thinking about this a long time.\" Aleta Alexander, 63, of Waterloo in eastern Iowa, was among several voters who said they were volunteering for the Obama campaign. \"I voted for him in 2008 because I thought for sure he was the president that was for all the people \u2014 not just blacks for whites or whatever but for everybody,\" she says. \"And I still believe that. So that's why I'm voting for him again.\" There were Romney supporters, even if they were a bit harder to find. Virginia Sourbeer of Des Moines, a retired state legislative staffer and former teacher, describes herself as socially moderate. But she says she's worried about the federal budget and spending in programs like Medicare and Social Security. Sourbeer says she trusts Romney more when it comes to the economy. \"I just think that his background, for one thing, and his record in Massachusetts, that he dealt with difficult economic times there, that he'll deal with the issue,\" she says. \"Because we've had somebody who will not deal with the issue the last four years.\" The Republican National Committee's Iowa spokesman, Tom Szold, says Republicans have intentionally held off on most efforts to promote absentee voting until this week. He says they believe Romney voters will show up on Election Day if not before. \"It's common knowledge that the Democrats are ahead of us in this,\" he says. \"They start much earlier and they focus largely on their base. And we think that's because they're basically worried that their base is not going to turn out on Election Day.\" But Erin Seidler, President Obama's campaign spokeswoman in Iowa, says promoting early voting just makes sense. \"We have 40 days to vote in Iowa. Why you would let any one of those days go by without getting folks to the polls is surprising to me,\" Seidler says. The Obama campaign has pushed early voting across the country, urging Iowans in particular to \"Be the First\" to vote for the president. Democrats have requested the overwhelming majority of absentee ballots in Iowa. But Republicans have an 18,000-person lead in voter registration. Polk County Auditor Jamie Fitzgerald says Democrats have a longer track record of working to get out the early vote. \"Recently Republicans have started doing it,\" he says. \"So the numbers are going to come a little bit closer. But the Democrats have been known for a lot of shoe leather, and working early.\" Iowa is among more than 30 states that allow early voting. Clay Masters, Pat Blank, and Dean Borg of Iowa Public Radio, and Omaha Public Radio's Katie Knapp Schubert contributed to this report",

            "article_content": "Libertarian Party presidential candidate Gary Johnson will be on the ballot in November in at least 47 states. The former Republican governor of New Mexico isn't likely to win any of them. But  he just might siphon off enough votes from one of the other candidates to affect the outcome.  DAVID GREENE, HOST: If you don't think a third party candidate can play a role in a presidential election, just ask George HW Bush about Ross Perot or ask Al Gore about Ralph Nader. This fall, the Libertarian Party will have a candidate on the ballot in at least 47 states. Former New Mexico Governor Gary Johnson probably won't be invited to the debates and pollsters don't usually even bother asking about him. But he could influence the outcome of a close election, as NPR Joel Rose reports. JOEL ROSE, BYLINE: Unless you're from New Mexico, where Gary Johnson served two terms as governor, you've probably never heard of him, but Johnson would like to change that. GARY JOHNSON: I am the only candidate advocating a balanced budget now. (APPLAUSE) ROSE: Gary Johnson gave a speech at New York University this month, part of his three-week tour of college campuses. He showed up for the occasion dressed in a blue blazer, faded jeans and T-shirt with a peace symbol on it. In interview, Johnson laid out all the other ways he is not like the two main candidates for the presidency and there are plenty. JOHNSON: I'm promising to submit a balanced budget to Congress in the year 2013, so that the $1.4 trillion reduction in federal spending. You've got to start off by talking about Medicaid, Medicare and military spending. ROSE: Johnson's fiscal prescription for the country makes the austere budget proposed by Republican vice president nominee Paul Ryan look like a stimulus plan. Johnson wants to abolish the IRS and the Federal Reserve. He would slash spending on defense and Medicare by a cool 43 percent. And Johnson is just as outspoken when it comes to social issues. He favors same-sex marriage and abortion, rights and even talks about ending the war on drugs. JOHNSON: As someone who smoked marijuana when they grew up, it may not be the best... ROSE: I'm sorry, are we clear? You smoked what? JOHNSON: I have smoked marijuana and I have drank alcohol. ROSE: Johnson said he doesn't do either anymore, but he does favor legalization and regulation of pot. While the two main presidential campaigns try to avoid deviating from the script, Johnson seems to like speaking his mind, regardless of the political consequences. JOHNSON: Nobody seems to be wanting to talk about the truth. And for those that believe that we continue to sustain the spending levels that we have by printing money, I'm going to argue that it's not sustainable. ROSE: Gary Johnson came to politics late. He built his own construction business in New Mexico and sold it before running for governor as a Republican in 1994. Even though he was an outsider, Johnson was allowed to participate in debates in New Mexico, but that's rarely been the case in his campaign for the White House. Johnson was allowed to appear in just two of the endless Republican primary debates, although he did manage to score this zinger. JOHNSON: My next-door neighbor's two dogs have created more shovel-ready jobs than this current administration. ROSE: Still, Johnson seems unlikely to participate in the presidential debates next month. Even former Minnesota Governor, Jesse Ventura, who is supposed to be warming up the crowd for Johnson in New York, acknowledged that's a big obstacle. JESSE VENTURA: Certainly, I'd like for him to win but he's not going to have a chance if he doesn't get in the debates - trust me on that. If you're not allowed to debate, you cannot win. ROSE: With that blunt assessment in mind, perhaps, Gary Johnson's campaign filed a law suit against the Commission on Presidential Debates last week arguing that he should be allowed to participate. Johnson knows he's fighting the perception that a vote for him is a wasted vote. He even jokes about it in his stump speech. JOHNSON: What happens if you all waste your vote on me? I will be the next president of the United States, and that will make a difference. ROSE: The college kids who came to hear Johnson speak in New York believe their votes can make a difference. Will Duffield is a sophomore at Sarah Lawrence College. WILL DUFFIELD: Well, Gary Johnson may not win this time around. If he polls at five percent, if he splits the vote, it's going to scare, especially the GOP establishment. In 2016, it may be the impetus they need to bring a more pro-liberty candidate onboard. ROSE: A recent poll, cosponsored by the Libertarian magazine Reason, found Johnson with six percent of the vote nationwide. If he polls anywhere near that well in key swing states like Colorado or Nevada, he could potentially draw enough votes away from Mitt Romney or Barack Obama to sway the outcome of the state and maybe the entire contest. That's hard to predict, in part because Gary Johnson's name is rarely included in state-level polling. But Johnson insists he wants to be more than just a spoiler. JOHNSON: Look, if Romney loses this election, who's the blame for that? Romney. Obama the same. By giving voice to what I think is the fastest-growing segment of American politics today - the whole liberty movement - I think that's really important. ROSE: And it could have important consequences in November. Joel Rose, NPR News, New York. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GREENE: It's MORNING EDITION from NPR News. Copyright \u00a9 2012 NPR.

There are still some 40-plus days to go, there are still debates to be had. It's true that Mitt Romney trails President Obama in most key battleground states, but the margins are in single digits. And, lest we forget, it's not that presidential candidates down in the polls haven't come from behind to win in the past. President Jimmy Carter and Republican challenger Ronald Reagan were neck and neck for much of September 1980, with Carter even opening a small polling lead at the end of the month and expanding it into October ... until their debate on Oct. 28. And Reagan won in a landslide. Richard Nixon had a 15-point lead over Hubert Humphrey at the end of September of 1968. A month later it was down to eight. On election eve, Nixon was still up, by about two points. He beat Humphrey by about half a point. Can Romney win without Ohio?\n                \n                    \n                    Ken Rudin collection\n                    \n                \nhide caption So there is evidence of voters changing their mind as the finish line approaches. But this year there doesn't seem to be much movement in the polls, and certainly not towards Romney. In my July 9 column, my projections had Obama with 247 electoral votes to Romney's 206, with 270 needed to win. Eighty-five electoral votes \u2014 from seven states \u2014 were still undecided. Since then, with the possible exception of Wisconsin, Romney has not advanced his cause in any of these states. And he's probably still trailing in the Badger State as well. Let's look at those seven tossups (and we may be adding North Carolina to that list, after having put it in Romney's totals): Colorado (9 electoral votes): Polls as of Aug. 6 column: Obama +1 2008 results: Obama +9 (54-45) Prez vote, 1988-2008: R-D-R-R-R-D Now: A recent Marist poll, conducted for the Wall Street Journal/NBC News, had Obama leading, 50-45 percent. An earlier Quinnipiac poll, for the New York Times/CBS News, had Obama up by one, 48-47 percent. Ryan Witt of the Examiner writes, \"Of the seven polls released from Colorado over the last two weeks, Obama led in six of them. The more recent polls from the last week show Obama up by three-to-six points.\" Romney arrived in the state on Sunday, trying to reverse that trend. Florida (29 electoral votes): Polls as of Aug. 6 column: Obama +6 2008 results: Obama +3 (51-48) Prez vote, 1988-2008: R-R-D-R-R-D Now: Romney got some good news today, as a Mason-Dixon poll conducted for the Miami Herald and Tampa Bay Times has the race a dead heat: 48 percent Obama, 47 percent Romney. And for all the concerns about the future of Medicare \u2014 and whether the selection of Paul Ryan for V.P. would hurt the GOP cause among seniors \u2014 the poll showed Romney holding his own on the issue. Asked who they trust more to keep Medicare financially stable, 49 percent said Obama, 47 percent Romney. Prior to the Mason-Dixon numbers, most polls showed a bigger Obama advantage. Both Marist and Fox News had Obama up 49-44 percent. Iowa (6 electoral votes): Polls as of Aug. 6 column: Obama +5 2008 results: Obama +9 (54-45) Prez vote, 1988-2008: D-D-D-D-R-D Now: I haven't seen any objective polling since a mid-September WSJ/NBC poll had Obama up by eight. (Rasmussen has Romney up by three.) One person told me that Republicans thought Iowa was slipping away; another said the state was far closer than anyone had expected. I can't get a sense of where things are. Nevada (6 electoral votes): Polls as of Aug. 6 column: Obama +5 2008 results: Obama +12 (55-43) Prez vote, 1988-2008: R-D-D-R-R-D Now: Talking Points Memo's Poll Tracker has the president leading on the average of 5.7 percent. Politico's Darren Goode writes that Nevada should be a \"ripe pickoff target\" for Romney: \"The economy has been decimated by the housing crisis; an influx of new and largely politically unaffiliated residents has moved in; and the Republican Party has spent big to organize. The state also has a significant Mormon population.\" But, he adds, the state \"also has a large Hispanic population hostile to his anti-immigration stands, an active union political base of well-organized casino workers and Harry Reid's political machine, all mobilized to help Obama.\" New Hampshire (4 electoral votes): Polls as of Aug. 6 column: Obama +4 2008 results: Obama +9 (54-45) Prez vote, 1988-2008: R-D-D-R-D-D Now: Looks to be a true tossup state, with an ever-so-slight edge to Obama. North Carolina (15 electoral votes): Polls as of Aug. 6 column: Romney +5 2008 results: Obama +1 (50-49) Prez vote, 1988-2008: R-R-R-R-R-D Now: The Tar Heel State was long thought to be returning to the GOP fold this year. But a new poll by the Civitas Institute has Obama leading, 49-45 percent. That's a bigger lead than a poll from last week, by High Point University, indicated; that one had Obama up 46-43 percent. Whatever the margins, the fact that the two most recent polls in North Carolina have Romney trailing is of great concern to the Republican camp. Ohio (18 electoral votes): Polls as of Aug. 6 column: Obama +6 2008 results: Obama +5 (52-47) Prez vote, 1988-2008: R-D-D-R-R-D Now: Not good news for Romney in a state that every Republican carried en route to the White House. A new University of Cincinnati poll for the Cincinnati Enquirer has Obama ahead 51-46 percent. A recent Marist poll had the president up seven. These numbers are not lost on Romney, who is beginning a bus tour of the state this week. Both sides are pouring a ton of money into Ohio. Virginia (13 electoral votes): Polls as of Aug. 6 column: Even 2008 results: Obama +7 (53-46) Prez vote, 1988-2008: R-R-R-R-R-D Now: This is a state that before 2008 had not voted for a Democratic presidential candidate since Lyndon Johnson in 1964. But new polls show they may once again favor Obama. A Fox News poll had the president up 50-43 percent. Marist had it 49-44 percent. It was 52-44 percent in the Washington Post poll, and 50-46 in Quinnipiac/N.Y. Times. One more thing to consider: As Romney tries to turn the corner and hope that events \u2014 and debates \u2014 will put him into the lead, there is also the specter of early voting that he must contend with. More than 30 states allow voters to cast their ballots in advance of November 6, starting with Iowa, on Sept. 27. (Ohio begins early voting on Oct. 2, North Carolina on the 18th and Nevada on the 20th.) If the estimates are correct, that close to 40 percent of all voters may commit in advance, the Romney strategy of hoping for a mid-to-late October turnaround could be in jeopardy.

Time for some readers' questions: Q: It strikes me that both members of the 2012 Republican ticket are from traditionally Democratic, or at least progressive, states (Mitt Romney's Massachusetts being solidly blue and Paul Ryan's Wisconsin not having voted red in a presidential election in 24 years). Has there ever been an election where a ticket lost the home states of both the presidential and vice-presidential candidates? \u2014 Ryan Holtan-Murphy, London, England A: The last time it happened was in 1972, when the Democratic presidential ticket of George McGovern and Sargent Shriver lost both McGovern's home state of South Dakota and Shriver's Maryland. Of course, the Democrats lost 49 states that year. Q: If George Romney \u2014 Mitt's father \u2014 was born in Mexico, how was he allowed to run for president in 1968? I thought all candidates had to be born in the U.S. in order to run. \u2014 Barry Lindenman, Charlotte, N.C. (Similarly, Roy Sorenson of Minneapolis, Minn., and Louis Gudema of Newton, Mass.) A: This question has been a popular one in the past year, and so I thought I would address it again. Article II of the Constitution plainly states that \"no person except a natural born Citizen... shall be eligible to the Office of President.\" However, it's never been completely clear what that means. The same issue came up during the first presidential run of Sen. John McCain, who was born in the Panama Canal Zone. Here's how I addressed this question in a July 9, 1998 Political Junkie column, back when it was running at washingtonpost.com: Some might define the term \"natural-born citizen\" as one who was born on United States soil. But the First Congress, on March 26, 1790, approved an act that declared, \"The children of citizens of the United States that may be born beyond sea, or outside the limits of the United States, shall be considered as natural-born citizens of the United States.\" That would seem to include McCain, whose parents were both citizens and whose father was a Navy officer stationed at the U.S. naval base in Panama at the time of John's birth in 1936. ... The citizenship question has come up in past presidential campaigns. George Romney, the late Michigan governor and a leading aspirant for the 1968 Republican presidential nomination, was born in Chihuahua, Mexico. ... During the period when he was still being touted as the only Republican who could defeat President Lyndon Johnson, Romney's opponents often raised the issue of his eligibility. William Loeb, the late publisher of the Manchester Union Leader who made his conservative views well known to New Hampshire primary voters, simply dismissed Romney as \"Chihuahua George.\" But Romney was eligible. Romney's grandfather emigrated to Mexico in 1886 with his three wives and children after Congress outlawed polygamy. Romney and his parents, who retained their U.S. citizenship, returned to the United States in 1912, the year Mexico erupted into revolution. This has yet to be tested in the courts. Q: I liked your trivia question this week [the first time two women squared off in a Senate race]. Do you have a complete list of the times when both candidates were women? \u2014 Ann Davis, Scottsdale, Ariz. They were the first.\n                \n                    \n                    Ken Rudin collection\n                    \n                \nhide caption A: For those who didn't hear the Political Junkie segment on NPR's Talk of the Nation on Wednesday, the answer was Maine in 1960, when Sen. Margaret Chase Smith (R) defeated Lucia Cormier (D). This year there are a record three instances where both major party candidates for the Senate are women: in California, where Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D) faces Elizabeth Emken (R); Hawaii, where Rep. Mazie Hirono (D) and former Gov. Linda Lingle (R) face each other in an open contest; and New York, where Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D) is being opposed by Wendy Long (R). Here are the previous times: 2008 (North Carolina): Kay Hagan (D) unseated Sen. Elizabeth Dole (R) 2006 (Maine): Sen. Olympia Snowe (R) defeated Jean Hay Bright (D) 2006 (Texas): Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R) defeated Barbara Ann Radnofsky (D) 2002 (Louisiana): Sen. Mary Landrieu (D) defeated Suzanne Terrell (R) 2002 (Maine): Sen. Susan Collins (R) defeated Chellie Pingree (D) 1998 (Washington): Sen. Patty Murray (D) defeated Rep. Linda Smith (R) 1986 (Maryland): Rep. Barbara Mikulski (D) defeated Linda Chavez (R) 1960 (Maine): Sen. Margaret Chase Smith (R) defeated Lucia Cormier (D) Oops. Two mistakes of mine that were caught by attentive readers. During a recent special Junkie segment on Talk of the Nation, where we talked about memorable moments from past conventions, a caller mentioned the time when Jimmy Carter referred to Hubert Humphrey as \"Hubert Horatio Hornblower.\" I misstated the year he did that. Joy Tlou of Park City, Utah, not only reminded me it was at the 1980 convention, but he supplied the video link from YouTube: And in the Sept. 4 Junkie column, I said that John McCain was, at 72, the oldest non-incumbent nominee in history. Sally Smith of Ashburn, Va., correctly pointed out that Bob Dole, the GOP nominee in 1996, was 73. Also, Jeff Book of Los Angeles thought it was a mistake for me to list John Nance Garner as simply another member of Congress who was picked in 1932 as the vice-presidential running mate (on a list that included Geraldine Ferraro in 1984, William Miller in 1964, and now Paul Ryan). Jeff wrote: \"Garner was not just another representative. He was speaker of the House, and had already spent two years as second in the line of succession to the presidency. As speaker he had a national constituency, far outside the boundaries of his own House district. Moreover, his speakership was of major symbolic importance, since it personified the resurgence of Democrats in 1930, and presaged the election of FDR in 1932. When he was chosen for vice president, he was the highest-ranking Democrat in the Federal government.\" Political Junkie segment on Talk of the Nation. Each Wednesday at 2 p.m. ET, the Political Junkie segment appears on Talk of the Nation (NPR's call-in program), hosted by Neal Conan with me adding color commentary, where you can, sometimes, hear interesting conversation, useless trivia questions and sparkling jokes. Last week's segment had special guest John Harris of Politico talking about the worries inside the Romney campaign, in addition to a breakout on Senate races. I also had a chat with Linda Wertheimer on NPR's Weekend Edition on Sunday, talking about women running for the Senate. You can hear that masterpiece here as well. Podcast.

            "article_content": "President Barack Obama and Republican vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan addressed the annual AARP convention in New Orleans on Friday.  ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: This is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. I'm Robert Siegel. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: And I'm Audie Cornish. In New Orleans today, thousands of senior citizens were treated to two different visions for their future. President Obama and GOP vice presidential candidate Paul Ryan each addressed the AARP. As NPR's Ina Jaffe reports, they took questions on topics ranging from Medicare to Social Security, and back to Medicare. INA JAFFE, BYLINE: There's a simple reason why both men wanted to talk to this crowd: more than half of the electorate is 50 years old or more, and older voters are more likely to vote. (APPLAUSE) PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Thank you, AARP. (APPLAUSE) JAFFE: The president joined the crowd via satellite from northern Virginia, where he would later hold a rally. It didn't take him long to take a shot at Mitt Romney's criticism of the 47 percent who pay no income taxes. Many of those are seniors on Social Security and Mr. Obama let the AARP members know he saw them differently. OBAMA: Medicare and Social Security are not handouts. You've paid into these programs your whole lives. (APPLAUSE) OBAMA: You've earned them. And as president, it's my job to make sure that Medicare and Social Security remain strong for today's seniors and for future generations. JAFFE: The AARP is nonpartisan, but the organization does support the president's Affordable Care Act, often called ObamaCare. And the audience cheered and stood and applauded frequently even though Mr. Obama couldn't see or hear them. The president warned them that contrary to what they'd hear in a little while from Congressman Ryan, the Affordable Care Act has strengthened Medicare. And the president said they shouldn't believe Ryan when he says that ObamaCare robs $716 billion from Medicare. OBAMA: That is simply not true. What we did was... (APPLAUSE) OBAMA: ...we went after waste and fraud and overcharging by insurance companies, for example. JAFFE: Paul Ryan had to take the stage after President Obama had told everyone what a disaster Ryan's plans for Medicare would be. But it's really the other way around, said Ryan. (APPLAUSE) REPRESENTATIVE PAUL RYAN: The first step to a stronger Medicare is to repeal ObamaCare... (SOUNDBITE OF BOOING) RYAN: ...because it represents the worst of both worlds. (SOUNDBITE OF BOOING) RYAN: I had a feeling there would be mixed reactions, so let me get into it. (SOUNDBITE OF BOOING) JAFFE: In this closely divided crowd, Ryan was heckled and booed as much as he was applauded. He argued that ObamaCare would use Medicare as a, quote, \"piggy bank,\" cutting $716 billion from the program. He didn't mention that his own plan would also rely on the same $716 billion in reduced costs. One thing that his plan would not do, he said, is put crucial decisions about Medicare in the hands of an advisory panel, as he argued ObamaCare would. RYAN: We propose putting 50 million seniors, not 15 unaccountable bureaucrats, in charge of their own health care decisions. (APPLAUSE) JAFFE: He denied that amounted to a voucher program, as the president has charged. RYAN: That's a poll-tested word basically designed to scare today's seniors. JAFFE: Ryan also spoke briefly of his plans to save Social Security by, among other things, gradually raising the retirement age. He said that his and Mitt Romney's plans for Medicare and Social Security include bipartisan proposals that have been around for years, and that their administration would reach across the aisle. President Obama also said he wanted to work with Republicans to strengthen Social Security and Medicare. And he, once again, gave credit to Mitt Romney for pioneering the Massachusetts health care law that inspired the president's own. Ina Jaffe, NPR News, New Orleans. Copyright \u00a9 2012 NPR.

She runs a 1-acre organic farm with her husband, but she says they don't talk politics at home because it gets too heated.\n                \n                    \n                    Melissa Block/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Heidi Accola works a stand at the farmers market in Baraboo, Wis. She runs a 1-acre organic farm with her husband, but she says they don't talk politics at home because it gets too heated. Wisconsin is a prime battleground state in this year's presidential election. Republicans hope the pick of native son Paul Ryan as their vice presidential nominee will bolster their chances to turn the state red in November. Wisconsin hasn't voted for a Republican for president since 1984. Barack Obama won the state by a blowout 14 points in 2008. And a run of Wisconsin polls this week shows him widening his lead over Mitt Romney. So what do Wisconsin voters have to say about their choices \u2014 and their mood? Economic Strain If politics is really a big circus \u2014 forgive the metaphor \u2014 then why not start talking to voters at the Circus World Museum in Baraboo, Wis., home to the Ringling brothers? Stephen Freese, the executive director, says he's a Romney supporter. He thinks Romney's business background will help jump-start the stalled economy. The summer drought has really hurt here, Freese says. With gas prices up, attendance is down at Circus World \u2014 and those who do come are cautious. \"We see them spending much more time buying the necessities than the extras,\" says Freese, \"so the gift shop isn't as busy as the restaurant, because they just aren't able to purchase everything they used to do on a credit card. They know they ultimately have to pay for it, and they're concerned about the stability of their job.\" Baraboo is in Sauk County in south-central Wisconsin, which voted for Obama by a 22-point margin. But then it flipped, going for Republican Scott Walker for governor in 2010 and voting against his recall this year. Stretching For Health Insurance In downtown Baraboo, the Wednesday morning farmers market is in full swing. Small stands are filled with squash and sunflowers, potatoes and pickles. Maury Gurgel farms near Reedsburg, Wis. His big issue? Health insurance. He says the cost to cover him and his wife is punishing. \"I'm a little older, and we're spending every bit of our savings to buy health insurance. It's taken a toll on our business, too. I can't afford to hire people if I have to spend $1,000 a month on health care premiums,\" he says. \"We're going to be going without [insurance] pretty soon, probably. ... We've had to spend all of our retirement savings just to keep it going.\" Gurgel says what he'd really like to see is a single-payer system, like Canada's. Over and over in Baraboo, I hear people talk about health care \u2014 how good insurance is out of their reach. Mary Keeser, who is shopping at the farmers market, is a nurse and an Obama supporter. \"Let's have the same health care that the senators and legislature has,\" she says. \"If they want to make it equal, let's do that. I mean, we'll have excellent health care. But people that have insurance don't understand people that don't have insurance, you know. And I see it on a daily basis.\" Political Wounds Keeser says Obama \"walked into a mess.\" \"You can't solve that in four years,\" she adds. \"And I think given, you know, a few more years, things will straighten out a bit. But I think it's going to take maybe a generation to straighten out the mess the Republicans got us in.\" Heidi Accola runs a 1-acre organic farm with her husband. She's a solid Democrat, an Obama backer. He's a staunch Republican who will vote for Romney, she says. \"We try not to talk politics because it gets so heated,\" she says with a laugh. \"We have very opposing political views, so we really just try not to go there.\" A bumper sticker on the car of Bob Greenwood of Baraboo, Wis. \"Recall Santa\" reflects the bitterly divisive recall election this year, which Republican Gov. Scott Walker survived easily.\n                \n                    \n                    Melissa Block/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption A bumper sticker on the car of Bob Greenwood of Baraboo, Wis. \"Recall Santa\" reflects the bitterly divisive recall election this year, which Republican Gov. Scott Walker survived easily. In Wisconsin, emotions are still extremely raw after the bitter fight over public unions and the unsuccessful vote to recall Walker. A few tables down, Deb Kozlowski-Brylla is setting out beautiful strawberries. She is sick of politics. She says the bruising recall battle didn't help. \"This will probably be the first year I will not vote,\" she says. \"Because I am really disappointed in the parties \u2014 both parties, all parties. I think political parties are ruining the United States. We ... no longer stand for what you believe in; we stand for a party. And I don't believe that. So I'm not going to vote for anybody.\" Another sign of that sharp divide over the recall election: We spot a car with a bumper sticker that says, \"Recall Santa! I didn't get what I wanted!\" It belongs to Bob Greenwood, who's in the Viking Village market, having coffee with his buddies. \"I think that President Obama is doing a terrible job on the economy,\" he says. \"Romney, I think, is not my first choice, but I'm going to vote for him. I would rather have seen [former Arkansas Gov.] Mike Huckabee, to be honest with you, but Romney will be my vote.\" His friend Harold Heiser, a Vietnam veteran, chimes in with what's on his mind: \"I think we should quit giving weapons to other countries, because they turn around and fight against us. I mean, they're burning our flag. When's it going to stop? There ain't enough love in this world.\" When it comes to his choices for November, Heiser says Romney's \"got a lot of good things.\" As for Obama: \"He said change. I haven't seen any change. The only change is more unemployment and more debt.\" In The 'Mulligrubs' We end our day in Baraboo outside Blain's Farm & Fleet \u2014 a megastore selling farm equipment, hunting gear, a lot of everything. Rick Sherman is heading to his bright yellow pickup. He's a Republican and 98 percent behind Romney, he says. He finds some truth in Romney's message about too much entitlement. As a paramedic, he says he sees people taking advantage of the system. \"Nothing [is] as frustrating as going in and a lady's got three or four or five kids, and she's pregnant with another one. You want to say: Do you realize how you get pregnant? And she's like, 'Well, you know, I get BadgerCare and Medicare for all my kids, and the more I have, I get more money for it,' \" he says. \"And then you go to the old people's house, where Grandma and Grandpa are going, 'OK, which med do I take? Which one do I skimp on because I don't have money for it?' \" Then, paving contractor Chris Butler waves us over to talk. He says he sees a down mood, and wonders whether politics is to blame. \"Walking around the store in there, nobody's smiling. Nobody seems to be happy,\" he says. \"Maybe that's why everybody's so in the mulligrubs, frowning. I don't know, maybe everybody's got politics on the mind.\" Mulligrubs? \"That's something my uncle always said: 'Don't be in the mulligrubs.' I really don't know what the mulligrubs are, but I don't think it's good,\" Butler says. For the record, the Dictionary of American Regional English describes the \"mulligrubs\" as \"a condition of despondency or ill temper; a vague or imaginary unwellness.\" In my conversations in Baraboo, Wis., I didn't find any of those elusive undecided voters. And I didn't talk with anybody brimming with passion about their candidate, either. I found many people deeply pained by the divide between political extremes, hoping for more dialogue and wishing they felt better about this election.",

            "article_content": "Wisconsin Senate candidate Tammy Baldwin sits with state delegates during the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, N.C., on Sept. 5.\n                \n                    \n                    David Goldman/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Wisconsin Senate candidate Tammy Baldwin sits with state delegates during the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, N.C., on Sept. 5. Republicans hoping to gain control of the U.S. Senate in November's elections are banking on Wisconsin where they want to flip the seat held by Democrat Herb Kohl, who's retiring. The Republican vying for that seat is Tommy Thompson, a four-time governor of the state. He left to serve as secretary of health and human services under President George W. Bush. Thompson's rival is seven-term Democratic Rep. Tammy Baldwin of Madison, who is among the most liberal members of Congress. If she wins, Baldwin would be the first openly gay U.S. senator. A number of polls out this week show a Baldwin surge. \"It was exciting to see some real momentum, and I'm thrilled,\" Baldwin says about the poll results during a crowded lunch gathering of Rotarians in Milwaukee. A week earlier, the Rotary Club heard from Thompson. This time, it's Baldwin's turn. Her message has threads of economic populism: The top earners should pay more in taxes. Special interests have too much power. \"The Wisconsin I know really does use fairness as its guidepost,\" she tells the group. Soft-spoken in person, the 50-year-old Baldwin is portrayed as a strident, snarling liberal extremist in opposing ads. They highlight her past statements supporting a single-payer health care system. An anti-Baldwin Republican Web video shows her raising a fist and shouting \"solidarity\" with union members during the huge protests that roiled the state capital last year. When asked to respond to the charge from Thompson that she's \"out of the mainstream of Wisconsin voters,\" Baldwin says: \"I believe I'm in the finest tradition of Wisconsin progressives. And so I consider myself a fighter for the hard-working families in this state.\" Attacking On 'Special Interests' Wisconsin has been consistently blue in presidential elections; it hasn't voted for a Republican for president since Ronald Reagan. In 2008, Barack Obama swept the state by a whopping 14 points. But two years ago, a Republican wave washed over this state. Republicans gained the governorship, a U.S. Senate seat and two Democratic House seats and won control of both houses of the state Legislature. And this spring, Gov. Scott Walker easily survived a recall vote. Despite that, Baldwin says she thinks Wisconsin will swing back to the Democrats in November. As for her opponent, Thompson \u2014 who was known as a reformer, someone able to bridge party divides as governor \u2014 he has swerved to the right, she says. \"He has become somebody who disavows compromise. He signed a pledge to a D.C. lobbyist, Grover Norquist, and said on certain tax issues, he will not compromise,\" she says. \"He told a Tea Party group: 'I'm the guy who did away with welfare, and I'll do same with Medicare and Medicaid.' You know, I think people are recognizing that I'm the candidate who is fighting for them, not for the powerful special interests in Washington.\" Baldwin is hitting that theme hard in a campaign ad. \"Tommy Thompson left Wisconsin for Washington \u2014 boy, did he,\" it says. \"Working for George Bush, Tommy cut a sweetheart deal with drug companies, making it illegal for Medicare to negotiate lower prescription drug prices. It cost taxpayers $156 billion. Then Tommy made millions working for a lobbying firm that represents drug companies.\" Wisconsin Senate candidate Tommy Thompson, a Republican, talks to the media after voting in the primary election on Aug. 14 in Madison.\n                \n                    \n                    Andy Manis/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Wisconsin Senate candidate Tommy Thompson, a Republican, talks to the media after voting in the primary election on Aug. 14 in Madison. Thompson's response? \"There's an old adage that says when you don't have a case, you attack the person individually and personally. She has nothing to run on except demagoguery.\" Regulation And Taxation He says: \"There's nobody more Wisconsin than Tommy Thompson.\" \"I still farm in Wisconsin. I still run and manage the family farm that's been in our family since 1861. Ninety percent of people in the state of Wisconsin know me as 'Tommy.' I'm true blue. When they cut me, it comes out cardinal red and a little bit of cheese. And that's Tommy Thompson.\" Thompson served an unprecedented 14 years as Wisconsin's governor, winning his last three elections in a landslide. He drew bipartisan support and is best known for overhauling the welfare system. Last month, at age 70, he squeaked through a bitter Republican primary, narrowly winning a four-way race. Thompson tried to reassure leery Tea Party supporters that he is \"way over on the right\" and \"not going to compromise.\" \"I'll repeal Obamacare,\" he promised. But conservatives remained skeptical. Now, his task is to persuade independent voters that he's on their side. \"Congresswoman Baldwin and President Barack Obama have been losing jobs all over America,\" he says. \"It is absolutely a difference in philosophy, a difference in direction \u2014 as different as day and night. And that is what the independents in the state of Wisconsin have got a chance to vote on. They want more government regulation, they should vote for Congresswoman Baldwin. If they want less government regulation, they should vote for me. \"If they want more taxation, they should vote for Congresswoman Baldwin, because she will deliver. Or if they want less taxation, then they should vote for Gov. Tommy Thompson. Simple, straightforward, and I'm confident the vast majority will vote for me.\" A State's Identity Crisis On a visit to Milwaukee's Ludman Industries, which makes heavy machinery, the former governor tours the plant and slaps the backs of machinists. One worker has an \"Impeach Obama\" bumper sticker plastered on his workstation on the factory floor. He tells Thompson, \"You got to take out that Tammy Baldwin.\" \"Send her out of town packing,\" he adds with a laugh. A new ad from Thompson shows scenes of him in a factory that looks much like the Ludman plant. \"Soon you will have an important choice to make between two very different visions for America,\" he says in the ad. \"A choice between expanding government or reforming it. My opponent supports the government takeover of health care and wants to expand government with higher taxes and more spending.\" A huge amount of outside ad money is flooding into Wisconsin. Meanwhile, this week's polls show the Baldwin campaign gaining steam. One shows the race now a dead heat. Another from Marquette Law School shows Baldwin leading Thompson by 9 points among likely voters. That's a complete reversal from a month ago, when Thompson led Baldwin by that same margin. The poll's director, Charles Franklin, calls that 18-point shift a \"wow\" \u2014 though he expects the race to tighten. Wisconsin, he says, is in the midst of an identity crisis: \"Which state are we? Are we the 14-point Obama state of 2008, in which case I think on the Senate side Baldwin is very competitive? Or are we the strong Walker state of 2010 and in the recall this year, in which case it's a much stronger position for Republicans?\"",

            "article_content": "President Obama leads Republican Mitt Romney by 8 points nationally \u2014 51 to 43 percent among likely voters \u2014 as the race heads into the final stretch, according to a new Pew Research Center poll released Wednesday. Obama's advantage, particularly among women, blacks and voters younger than 30, puts him \"in a strong position compared with past victorious presidential candidates,\" Pew reported. Obama's lead at this point in the race, Pew President Andrew Kohut told NPR's Robert Siegel, is \"stronger than the last three winning presidential candidates.\" Only Bill Clinton, running in both 1992 and 1996, had bigger leads in mid-September. Clinton's edge over incumbent President George H.W. Bush at this stage in 1992 was 53 to 38 percent; he led Republican Sen. Bob Dole 50 to 48 percent at this stage in 1996. Obama was tied with Republican Sen. John McCain at this point in 2008. Pew's survey of 2,424 registered voters, completed before this week's flap over Romney's videotaped \"47 percent\" comments, showed voters about evenly divided on which candidate they prefer on the issues of jobs and the deficit. The survey found, however, that Obama leads Romney on most key issues, including, and \"notably,\" Kohut says, \"health care, Medicare and abortion.\" Pew also found that Obama's support is stronger and more positive than Romney's. One of their findings: \"Roughly half of Romney backers say they are voting against Obama rather than for the Republican nominee. With the exception of Bill Clinton in 1992, candidates lacking mostly positive backing have lost in November.\" Obama led Romney by a 3-to-1 margin on Pew's question of which candidate connects well with voters. Romney also trailed Obama 50 to 40 percent when likely voters were asked who shares their values. Kohut says Obama's big edge in those categories is more due to Romney's ongoing difficulty connecting with voters than anything in particular Obama has done. \"His sense of connecting with ordinary people is not very good,\" Kohut said, noting that Romney's low credibility numbers drove down his net personable favorability rating to below 50 percent. \"No previous presidential candidate,\" Kohut wrote in his analysis, \"has been viewed so unfavorably at this point in a presidential campaign in Pew Research or Gallup September surveys going back to 1988.\" Obama also enjoyed strong support in the realm of foreign policy and, specifically, Middle East policy, where those surveyed preferred him over Romney by about 15 percentage points. Pew found that by a margin of 2-to-1, those surveyed disapproved of Romney's comments criticizing the administration during the recent crisis in Libya that left four Americans, including a U.S. ambassador, dead. Obama's strength with female voters was reflected in the Pew survey, where they gave him a 19-point advantage over Romney. Men were closely divided. Romney's strongest support came from white Evangelical Protestants. The Pew survey, Kohut says, was taken a week after the end of the Democratic National Convention and so \"doesn't reflect the immediate emotion\" of the convention. A flurry of presidential polls released in the past 24 hours have, with the exception of one, given Obama national leads ranging from 1 to 5 percentage points. The Rasmussen tracking poll has Romney up by 1. \"There's a lot of change going on right now,\" Kohut told Siegel. \"But you can say that the overall drift of the polling is for Obama.\"",

            "article_content": "In politically important Florida, seniors react to Mitt Romney's take on the so-called \"47 percent\" and the Middle East.  ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: The fundraiser where the Romney video was recorded was held in Florida. And today, in that politically important state, reaction was mixed about Romney's unscripted remarks. NPR's Kathy Lohr gathered some views from people at a retirement community. KATHY LOHR, BYLINE: At Westminster Oaks in Tallahassee, seniors gathered for breakfast, worked out in exercise classes and listened to radio or watched TV where they first heard Romney's remarks. Many in this group are part of the 47 percent who Romney said pay no income taxes and rely on the government. Republican Sudduth Cummings says Romney's observations are correct. SUDDUTH CUMMINGS: Well, I think he's being politically realistic and I think he's being accurate. LOHR: Cummings is an Episcopal priest who recently turned 65. He says the media are distorting Romney's comments. While many residents here do get social security and are on Medicare, Cummings says he doesn't consider those entitlements. Now Romney is not talking about people like him. CUMMINGS: For a lot of the retired, the older population, we've worked hard and we've taken responsibility for ourselves and, you know, we're prepared for this time. LOHR: But don't these comments, you know, sort of not take that into consideration? That some of these folks... CUMMINGS: Remember the context. He's talking about votes. And that's all this is about. LOHR: Around noon the dining area is busy, and just before the lunch hour I talk with Jalma Baker who's wearing a blue Barack Obama T-shirt. As you might guess, Baker has a different opinion. JALMA BAKER: I hope that the people that are undecided have second thoughts about what kind of a leader he would be with his focus so narrow and so limited. LOHR: Baker volunteers for the president's campaign here in Tallahassee. She says Romney's comments show disrespect for people who are not in his income bracket. BAKER: I think he's very limited. And I think he's always lived a very rich lifestyle and everybody around him is. And he just doesn't understand that that's not the way life is. He sort of divided into the super rich and the victims. I think that's kind of the way he views society. LOHR: Another resident, Everett Yarbrough, focused on Romney's comments on the Mideast peace process. Yarbrough is a Romney supporter and he says the president's policy is not clear to him so he's glad Romney's foreign policy positions are coming out. Still, he acknowledges that may not have happened in the best way. EVERETT YARBROUGH: Well, he certainly should consider his comments very carefully and what he was saying. And then, of course, in today's society with cell phones and all that, you pretty much got to say, whatever you say, somebody's going to record it like we're doing now. And I hope none of these come back to haunt me. LOHR: People here say it's unclear whether the comments will have a long term effect on Mitt Romney's candidacy. Kathy Lohr, NPR News, Tallahassee.

            "article_content": "Less than eight weeks before the presidential election, there's really no escaping political ads, especially if you live in one of the dozen or so battleground states where the election could turn. Traditional fact-check organizations are weighing in, as they have throughout the campaign. But so is On The Media's sometimes snarky, fact-checkish \"Media Scrutiny Theater 2012,\" which we've blogged about before. Media Scrutiny Theater's take on the ad, \"He Wins, We Lose.\" Recently, the program produced by public media's WNYC in New York has given its signature voice-over treatment to ads that include a pro-Mitt Romney superPAC conflating President Obama's health care law with Canada's government-run health care system, and a pro-Obama superPAC claiming that Romney wants \"a huge new $150,000 tax cut for the wealthiest 1 percent, while cutting Medicare and education for us.\" On The Media co-host Brooke Gladstone interrupts the ad to take that claim to task: \"That's a fuzzy figure. He says he'll slash taxes 20 percent for everyone, but he won't extend Obama's tax changes. So we don't know.\" On the health care ad, USA Today said the conservative Americans for Prosperity paid $6.2 million to hit the airwaves in 11 swing states in an ad buy timed to coincide with the Democratic National Convention. Media Scrutiny Theater's take on the ad, \"Canadian Health Care\" It also noted that nonpartisan \"fact-checkers who reviewed previous versions of the ad have said AFP employs a \"Canadian straw man,\" noting that Canada has a single-payer system without private insurance. Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act that Obama signed into law in 2010, patients still buy their own insurance, either through their employer or through state-run exchanges.\" The entire 30-second anti-Romney ad, funded by Priorities USA Action, features the now-famous image of a younger Romney posing with Bain Capital colleagues, all of them displaying cash. At times, the ad superimposes the face of a contemporary Romney onto the 1985 photo.",

Linda Lingle gives a victory speech in Honolulu after winning the Republican nomination for U.S. Senate on Aug. 11.\n                \n                    \n                    Marco Garcia/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Former Hawaii Gov. Linda Lingle gives a victory speech in Honolulu after winning the Republican nomination for U.S. Senate on Aug. 11. Republican hopes of capturing the Senate in November rest on a handful of tossup races in states like Montana, Missouri and Virginia. Surprisingly, some analysts also are putting Hawaii in the tossup column. Hawaii is the bluest of blue states; it hasn't elected a Republican to the Senate since 1970. But with the retirement of 22-year incumbent Daniel Akaka, Republicans believe they have a chance. And regardless of who wins, the state will have its first female senator come January. In Hawaii, the language of politics is a little different. Take for example Senate candidate and U.S. Rep. Mazie Hirono delivering her version of the customary Democratic talking points: \"Our next United States senator should share our values. Those are the values of protecting our kupuna \u2014 why I am such a strong voice for making sure that Social Security and Medicare remain strong for our kupuna. We need to protect our keiki.\" Keiki means \"children.\" Kupuna, as you may guess from the context, means \"elders\" \u2014 or in this case, seniors, who vote. Hirono's opponent for the Senate seat, former Gov. Linda Lingle, also uses some unusual vocabulary \u2014 especially when describing herself: \"A haole, Republican, Jewish woman from the mainland!\" Haoles \u2014 or whites \u2014 are a minority in Hawaii, as are Republicans. So it was quite the upset when Lingle beat Hirono in the governor's race in 2002. Lingle says the state's voters are capable of crossing the partisan divide. \"They elected me and re-elected me with the largest margin in state history as a Republican. They know I'm a Republican, but they know I also put people first,\" she says. \"So what does it mean in Hawaii to be a Republican? It means I'm a fiscal conservative, I'm a strong supporter of our military, but I'm also pro-choice. I'm a Hawaii Republican. I'm not a national Republican.\" Hirono, on the other hand, likes to refer to Lingle as \"the Republicans' top draft pick\" for this race, and she constantly reminds Hawaii voters of the math in the Senate. Democratic Rep. Mazie Hirono campaigns in Honolulu on Aug. 11.\n                \n                    \n                    Marco Garcia/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Democratic Rep. Mazie Hirono campaigns in Honolulu on Aug. 11. \"Regardless of how people feel about Linda Lingle, she is going to be one of the votes that the Republicans need nationally to totally take control over the U.S. Senate and push their agenda,\" Hirono says. Hirono warns that a Lingle win would mean one more vote in the Senate to repeal President Obama's health care law. Asked if that's true, Lingle dismisses it as a \"campaign question.\" She says she likes certain aspects of the law, but if she were presented with a simple choice of keeping or repealing the whole law, she'd get rid of it. \"If we're going to keep everything that's in there now or not, I would not support this,\" she says, but she insists it won't come to that. \"I don't believe that will ever be the only question,\" Lingle says. \"I'm a serious person; this is a serious issue. I think we need to approach it in a serious way, even though we're in campaign season.\" The fact that a Republican is this reluctant to talk about repealing the president's health care law speaks volumes about Hawaii. Dan Boylan, a history professor and liberal political columnist, says locals still have great pride in their native-son president, and they think he's been treated shabbily by mainland Republicans. \"They resent very much this 'birther' aspect of the Republican Party or the Tea Party movement or the crazies, whoever they are, who keep questioning ... where Barack Obama was born. We know where he was born,\" Boylan says. So Democratic turnout will be big, he says. Lingle's challenge is to convince some of the president's supporters to split their ballots. \"If any Republican can get elected to the Senate from this state, Linda Lingle can do it,\" Boylan says. Lingle does appear to have an edge when it comes to money, and she benefits from third-party advertising by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. So far, the few public polls give a significant edge to the Democrat. But the ad war is just warming up, and there's an expectation in Hawaii that voter preferences won't firm up until next month, when the candidates are scheduled for a series of televised debates.",

            "article_content": "After giving a speech that many consider one of the highlights of last week's Democratic convention, former President Bill Clinton hit the campaign trail Tuesday for President Obama, appearing at a university in Miami.  (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: It's MORNING EDITION from NPR News, I'm Renee Montagne. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: And I'm Steve Inskeep. Good morning. President Obama - and many other people, at this point - have joked that he should name former President Bill Clinton secretary of 'splaining stuff. Clinton has embraced that role, delivering a memorable address at the Democratic convention. And now, campaigning for the president in Florida, he will rally the troops in Orlando later today. Yesterday, NPR's Greg Allen followed the Clinton campaign in Miami. GREG ALLEN, BYLINE: Bill Clinton wasn't exactly apologetic about appearing at a political rally on the anniversary of 9/11. He talked about friends he lost that day, and was introduced by a firefighter who asked everyone - including Mr. Clinton - to observe a moment of silence. The former president did note, though, it was his first appearance at political event on September 11, since that day 11 years ago. And deftly turning the corner, he said the anniversary is a reminder to be a good citizen - and to show up and vote. (APPLAUSE) BILL CLINTON: When people try to discourage you from voting, which is happening in a lot of these voter - changes all over America, it should redouble your determination to vote. (APPLAUSE) ALLEN: That's Bill Clinton's main job on the campaign trail for President Obama - to build enthusiasm, and help Democrats begin mobilizing voters. During the rally, at a gymnasium on the campus of Florida International University, Obama workers combed through the crowd, working to register voters and sign up volunteers to help with canvassing and phone banks. But Mr. Clinton also went back to some of the themes he developed last week at the Democratic convention, such as what he characterized as the Republican argument against President Obama. CLINTON: We left him a mess. He didn't fix it all. Fire him, put us back in. (LAUGHTER) CLINTON: His case is, well, I stopped the slide into depression. I laid the foundation for the long road to recovery, and we've begun it. And we've got the building blocks of a modern, new, different economy. (CHEERS, APPLAUSE) ALLEN: And Mr. Clinton reprised his role of explainer in chief - breaking down the numbers, and the policies. He explained why, rather than a failure - as Republicans claim, President Obama's stimulus package was actually, in his view, a roaring success. He explained why the American economy is actually much better off than it was four years ago. And reaching back to his Arkansas roots, he even tried to explain why Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan are wrong, when they say President Obama hurt Medicare by cutting $716 billion in future growth. CLINTON: And they said that against us last time in the elections. And a lot of Republicans got elected to Congress in Florida, peddling that old dog. It's a mangy old dog; it's not true. (LAUGHTER) ALLEN: After five minutes of talk about President Obama's health-care law, the doughnut hole and Medicare Advantage programs, some in the audience - as they later admitted - were floundering. But Mr. Clinton finally brought it all home. CLINTON: He didn't weaken Medicare; he strengthened it. He didn't weaken Medicare Advantage; he strengthened it. But if you repeal the health-care law, and you repeal these savings, you are going to weaken Medicare Advantage. You are going to weaken Medicare. It is going to run out of money quicker. You are going to really weaken the senior drug program. Those are the facts. That's the arithmetic. And it is... (CHEERING) ALLEN: Afterwards, Obama supporter Linda Kirschenberg was ecstatic. LINDA KIRSCHENBERG: President Clinton is a phenomenal speaker. And he speaks from the heart, and he has all the right facts. I really like his arithmetic. ALLEN: But then again, Kirschenberg is a trained mathematician. Greg Allen, NPR News, Miami. Copyright \u00a9 2012 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Pooley/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Paul Ryan speaks to supporters in Westlake, Ohio, on Sept. 4. Ryan has been celebrated as a deficit hawk with bold vision, but some critics have called his record on deficit reduction \"dismal.\" Paul Ryan has a reputation as a deficit hawk. Mitt Romney's running mate has proposed budgets that cut non-defense spending significantly, and advocated controlling Medicare costs by making it a voucher program. But critics argue there's a lot in the Wisconsin congressman's record that undermines his deficit-hawk reputation. When Ryan gave the GOP response to President Obama's State of the Union address last year, he restated his commitment to debt and deficit reduction. \"We face a crushing burden of debt. The debt will soon eclipse our entire economy and grow to catastrophic levels in the years ahead,\" Ryan said in the 2011 response speech. \"On this current path when my three children \u2014 who are now 6, 7, and 8 years old \u2014 are raising their own children, the federal government will double in size and so will the taxes they pay. No economy can sustain such high levels of debt and taxation.\" That same year, deficit-cutting interest groups gave Ryan a fiscal responsibility award after he unveiled a budget plan that included a controversial proposal to curb the rise in Medicare costs. Bob Bixby, executive director of the Concord Coalition, praised Ryan for embracing a historically unpopular idea and said he thought to himself, \"Now there's a deficit hawk.\" Despite the praise from the anti-deficit groups, Stan Collender, a longtime federal budget analyst, says Ryan is not a deficit hawk. \"The Paul Ryan budget plans are tax cuts masquerading as deficit reductions,\" Collender says. \"And as his own numbers show, even with optimistic assumptions about revenues that'll be raised and revenues that will result from economic growth, he still doesn't balance the budget for 20 years or so.\" Collender, who now works for the public relations and lobbying firm Qorvis Communications, does acknowledge that Ryan's Medicare plan could reduce costs to the federal government. But Collender says throughout his career Ryan has talked tough on the deficit but supported policies that increase it. \"It includes everything from supporting tax cuts in the Bush administration to proposing big tax cuts that aren't paid for in his own plan to supporting a war that's not paid for, Medicare Part D plan not paid for and not standing in the way of it,\" Collender says. \"So, his record on deficit reduction is actually quite dismal.\" Deficit Hawk Or Small-Government Conservative? Alice Rivlin, the founding director of the Congressional Budget Office, says the criticism of Ryan misses the point. \"I think you have to distinguish deficit hawk from small-government conservative,\" Rivlin says. Rivlin, who was also the budget director in the Clinton White House and is a former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, says Ryan's primary goal transcends deficit reduction. \"I think of him as a man committed to a smaller government that has less of a role in people's lives,\" Rivlin says. \"He really believes that: that the government does too much. And he thinks taxes should be less.\" But Rivlin, who is now at the Brookings Institution, says she thinks Ryan's budget plans depend too much on cutting spending that will hurt the needy, like food stamps and Medicaid. Douglas Holtz-Eakin, another former CBO director, says he believes Ryan does deserve the deficit hawk label. But, he says, \"Not all deficit hawks are created equal.\" Holtz-Eakin, who advised John McCain during his 2008 presidential campaign, agrees with Rivlin that Ryan is first of all a small-government conservative. But Holtz-Eakin says Ryan's approach to deficit reduction is quite thoughtful. Ryan has been criticized because his budget proposals take more than two decades to reach balance. Holtz-Eakin argues that slow progress is to be expected if you're addressing entitlement programs like Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. \"It's hard to quickly change them, and you make the reforms now and over time you get the benefits, but you don't get quick budget reductions that way. To get quick budget reductions you'd have to do draconian things to those programs that I think would not be politically salable and actually aren't good policy.\" Holtz-Eakin does express some unease with Ryan's unstinting support for defense spending. He says what the Bowles-Simpson deficit-reduction effort taught us was that there are spending problems everywhere in the budget, and that includes defense.",

In his speech at the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, N.C., Thursday night, he said the path he suggests is \"harder, but it leads to a better place.\" He said the progress he'd  made so far would be  reversed if Mitt Romney won the White House.  RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: It's MORNING EDITION, from NPR News. Good morning. I'm Renee Montagne. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: And I'm Steve Inskeep. As he accepted his party's nomination for a second term last night, President Obama said that building a better future will take him more time. MONTAGNE: The president told his supporters at the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte that the progress he'd made so far would be reversed if Mitt Romney won the White House. NPR's national political correspondent Mara Liasson has this report on the president's speech and the evening that built up to it. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: The final night's program reached its emotional height early with a simple recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) GABBY GIFFORDS: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, liberty and justice for all. LIASSON: Many in the crowd were moved to tears when Gabby Giffords led the pledge. She is the former Arizona congresswoman who was shot in the head as she met with her constituents, and she's still recovering from her wound. UNIDENTIFIED GROUP: (Chanting) Fired up. Fired up. Ready to go. LIASSON: The delegates chanted the Obama campaigns rallying cry from 2008. UNIDENTIFIED GROUP: Fired up. Fired up. Ready to go. Ready to go. LIASSON: Senator John Kerry - widely considered a candidate to replace Hillary Clinton as secretary of state in the second Obama term - praised the president for his foreign policy achievements, including ending the war in Iraq, beginning a drawdown in Afghanistan and killing the head of al-Qaida. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) SENATOR JOHN KERRY: Ask Osama bin Laden if he is better off now than he was four years ago. LIASSON: Joe Biden accepted the nomination for vice president with an attack on Romney for opposing another one of the president's main accomplishments: the auto industry bailout. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: I don't think he understood that saving the automobile worker, saving the industry, what it meant to all of America, not just autoworkers. I think he saw it the Bain way. I mean this sincerely. I think he saw it in terms of balance sheets and write-offs. Folks, the Bain way may bring your firm the highest profits. But it's not the way to lead our country from the highest office. LIASSON: Obama campaign officials said yesterday that the president's speech was not going to be about magic, about recreating the lightning-in-a-bottle phenomenon of his first campaign. So Mr. Obama began his speech last night by acknowledging how much had changed since he first gave the keynote address at the Democratic Convention in 2004, a speech about hope. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Eight years later, that hope has been tested by the cost of war, by one of the worst economic crises in history and by political gridlock that's left us wondering whether it's still even possible to tackle the challenges of our time. LIASSON: Bill Clinton had provided a forceful defense of the Obama record on Wednesday, so last night, the president was free to focus on the future. He said the election was the clearest choice in a generation, between two different paths for America. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) OBAMA: Now, our friends down in Tampa at the Republican Convention were more than happy to talk about everything they think is wrong with America, but they didn't have much to say about how they'd make it right. They want your vote, but they don't want you to know their plan. And that's because all they have to offer is the same prescriptions they've had for the last 30 years:  Have a surplus? Try a tax cut. Deficit too high? Try another. Feel a cold coming on? Take two tax cuts, roll back some regulations and call us in the morning. LIASSON: He asked for more time to solve the country's problems, saying it will require more than a few years to solve challenges that have built up over decades. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) OBAMA: It will require common effort and shared responsibility and the kind of bold, persistent experimentation that Franklin Roosevelt pursued during the only crisis worse than this one. And by the way, those of us who carry on his party's legacy should remember that not every problem can be remedied with another government program or dictate from Washington. LIASSON: He offered a nod - but not much more - to those voters in the center who worry he is a big-government liberal. We the people, he said recognize we have responsibilities, as well as rights. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) OBAMA: We know that churches and charities can often make more of a difference than a poverty program alone. We don't want handouts for people who refuse to help themselves, and we certainly don't want bailouts for banks that break the rules. We don't think that government can solve all of our problems. But we don't think that the government is the source of all of our problems, any more than are welfare recipients or corporations or unions or immigrants or gays or any other group we're told to blame for our troubles. LIASSON: Mostly, this was a speech aimed at the crowd inside the hall, meant to fire up the base of the Democratic Party in an election year where there are so few truly undecided voters. The president said he had a real achievable plan for the next four years, and he laid out five broad goals for manufacturing, education, national security, the deficit and energy. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) OBAMA: And, yes, my plan will continue to reduce the carbon pollution that is heating our planet, because climate change is not a hoax. More droughts and floods and wildfires are not a joke. They are a threat to our children's future, and in this election, you can do something about it. LIASSON: Last night, President Obama chose to play it safe, a reflection of his campaign's confidence that they have a small, but durable lead in the battleground states. On the big fiscal problems facing the country, Mr. Obama said there was a way to reduce the deficit without wrecking the middle class and that he wanted tax reform, but only if the wealthy were asked to pay higher rates. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) OBAMA: I refuse to ask middle-class families to give up their deductions for owning a home or raising their kids just to pay for another millionaire's tax cuts. I refuse to ask students to pay more for college or kick children out of Head Start programs to eliminate health insurance for millions of Americans who are poor and elderly or disabled, all so those with the most can pay less. I'm not going along with that. LIASSON: On Medicare, he pushed back against the plan supported by Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) OBAMA: I will never turn Medicare into a voucher. No American should ever have to spend their golden years at the mercy of insurance companies. They should retire with the care and the dignity that they have earned. Yes, we will reform and strengthen Medicare for the long haul, but we'll do it by reducing the cost of health care, not by asking seniors to pay thousands of dollars more. LIASSON: But Mr. Obama didn't say how he'd reduce the cost of health care or describe any of the hard choices that might have to be made in order to achieve that. Earlier in the day, President Obama had spoken by conference call to some of the tens of thousands of people who had tickets to see him speak in an open-air stadium, but they were turned away when the event was moved inside because of the threat of thunderstorms. That cost the campaign an opportunity to reward and motivate thousands of grassroots volunteers. Speaking to the smaller crowd inside the arena, Mr. Obama seemed intent on rekindling as much enthusiasm as he could. The election four years ago wasn't about me, he said. You are the change. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) OBAMA: You're the reason a young immigrant who grew up here and went to school here and pledged allegiance to our flag will no longer be deported from the only country she's ever called home, why selfless soldiers won't be kicked out of the military because of who they are or who they love, why thousands of families have finally been able to say to loved ones who served us so bravely welcome home, welcome home. You did that. You did that. LIASSON: The crowd in the hall was energized, but the monthly jobs numbers just out this morning are a reminder of the economic forces that Mr. Obama can't control, but must overcome in order to win a second term.

            "article_content": "Presidential debate coaches from past campaigns say things used to be much simpler. GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney is spending three days in Vermont this week preparing for next month's debates. President Obama has started his debate preparations too.  RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: It's MORNING EDITION, from NPR News. Good morning. I'm Renee Montagne. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: And I'm Steve Inskeep. Mitt Romney has not done any campaigning the last few days. He's in Vermont with senior aides, preparing for debates next month. And even as President Obama prepares for tonight's big speech, campaign aides say he has been preparing for debates, too. NPR's Ari Shapiro asked past debate coaches what happens behind the scenes. ARI SHAPIRO, BYLINE: Things used to be so much simpler, says Michael Waldman. He's a veteran of the Clinton administration. MICHAEL WALDMAN: John F. Kennedy prepped for the first presidential televised debate by looking at a few note cards with one aide. SHAPIRO: Nowadays, staffers assemble thick briefing books months in advance. Once the candidate has studied them, he stands on mock debate stage with a carefully chosen mock opponent and cameras rolling. That's so everyone can review the footage afterwards. Karen Hughes remembers long days in Crawford, Texas with George W. Bush and a parade of experts. KAREN HUGHES: So it could be anything from Medicare to, if you had tax policy, you'd have the economists in the room. If it was foreign policy, you'd have the foreign policy specialists. SHAPIRO: The goal is to exhaust every possible question and rehearse the perfect answer for each one, so by the time you get to the debate itself, there are no surprises. But memorizing the book alone is not enough. The candidates have to learn how to boil answers down and tie them into a campaign theme that makes sense to voters. Republican Ed Rollins coached presidential candidate Jack Kemp in 1988. ED ROLLINS: You know, Jack had 40 ideas in his head at any one given moment. And you have to get the answers down to 30 or 60 seconds. It was kind of hard for him to do. SHAPIRO: Once you've finally got the substance, style is just as critical. Al Gore learned that lesson the hard way. In the 2000 race, Gore had all the answers. Problem was, he acted like a guy who had all the answers. This sigh may have handed debate victory to George W. Bush. (SOUNDBITE OF PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE) PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH: I've had a record of appointing judges in the state of Texas. (SOUNDBITE OF SIGH) That's what a governor gets to do. A governor... SHAPIRO: After the debate, style turned to spin. The Bush team talked about how domineering Gore was, how he argued with the moderator and invaded Bush's space. It worked. Bush was judged the debate's winner. But four years later, Bush had body language problems of his own. Every time John Kerry answered a question, Bush would frown. Karen Hughes had to break the news to him after the debate. HUGHES: He thought he did a good job in the debate. And I said, well, except for that cut shot when you kept scowling at the camera. (LAUGHTER) SHAPIRO: The candidates and their coaches know that one good zinger can win a debate, and they spend days searching for the perfect phrase. Ed Rollins worked with Ronald Reagan. ROLLINS: If you hit on a couple of those, you sort of dominate the news media for the next couple of days. SHAPIRO: For example, in 1984, people openly wondered whether Reagan was too old for another four years in office. This line was carefully scripted and powerfully effective. (SOUNDBITE OF PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE) PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN: I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent's youth and inexperience. SHAPIRO: One of the best-remembered zingers of all time came from Lloyd Bentsen in 1988. Debate coach Bob Shrum knew that Bentsen's opponent liked comparing himself to JFK. And sure enough, Dan Quayle made the comparison in the debate. BOB SHRUM: And Lloyd Bentsen was entirely prepared to turn to him and say... (SOUNDBITE OF VICE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE) LLOYD BENTSEN: Senator, I served with Jack Kennedy. I knew Jack Kennedy. Jack Kennedy was a friend of mine. Senator, you're no Jack Kennedy. SHAPIRO: There's a balancing act, though. While debate coaches hate surprise, they don't want to over-prepare, either. A candidate with too much information in his head can seem unfocused. Karen Hughes says George W. Bush understood that danger as far back as the Texas governor's race. HUGHES: He told the staff: If you have any ideas for what I should say, tell Karen. And it was a very smart move, because by debate day, my head was so crammed with stuff, I could not think. SHAPIRO: All of this preparation comes down to one goal, and it isn't convincing a panel of judges, says former Clinton aide Michael Waldman. WALDMAN: All these candidates know that it's not about winning points in a high school debating championship. It's about persuading the public one way or another that you're ready to be president. SHAPIRO: It's a strange gauntlet to run, because there are lots of things a president has to be good at. But outside of a campaign, the president of the United States will never actually debate anyone. Ari Shapiro, NPR News. Copyright \u00a9 2012 NPR.  All rights reserved.

President Obama still has a case to make for a second term, and specific people to whom he needs to make it. But while it's two months too early to call former President Bill Clinton Obama's closer, he came about as close as it gets Wednesday night at the Democratic convention with a bravura defense of the current White House occupant. \"We are here to nominate a president,\" Clinton said after strolling onto the stage to tumultuous applause, \"and I've got one in mind.\" What followed was a familiar and classic Clinton performance, tailored not to the audience in the Charlotte arena \u2014 or mindful of the ticking clock \u2014 but to those watching at home, especially in battleground states like Ohio and Michigan. He packed his speech with policy and numbers, folksy asides accentuated with an Arkansas drawl, and a full-on attempt to rebut the messages out of the GOP convention last week in Tampa. Point by point, and with a special, smiling sarcasm for assertions made by GOP vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan and his Medicare and Medicaid spending proposals. President Obama greets former President Bill Clinton onstage at the Democratic National Convention.\n                \n                    \n                    Streeter Lecka/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption But perhaps more important than Clinton's Republican convention rebuttal, and contrasting the two parties, was his attempt to build a bridge over which reluctant voters worried about the economy could walk to the Democrats' \u2014 and Obama's \u2014 side in November. His argument was economic and personal. He spoke of the deeply damaged economy Obama inherited, one that was shedding 750,000 jobs a month \u2014 a scenario worse, he said, than the one he faced when elected in 1992. But Obama \"stopped the slide into depression\" and has built a floor under the economic cracks, Clinton said, and started a foundation. \"Are we where we want to be today?\" he asked. \"Is the president satisfied?\" \"No,\" came the answer. \"But are we better off than when he took office?\" he asked. \"Yes.\" The challenge to Obama is speaking to people who are not yet feeling the slow recovery taking place. Renew the president's contract, he said, and \"you will feel it.\" On the personal side, Clinton tapped into polls showing that Americans hunger for a functioning government and leaders who compromise. He made his case for Obama as committed to constructive work and derided what he characterized as the far right's overt hatred of the president, which has included rooting for his failure. \"Democracy does not ... have to be a blood sport,\" he said. \"It can be an honorable enterprise that advances the public interest.\" Obama and Clinton's wife, Hillary, proved that, the ex-president said, when, after their bitterly fought 2008 primary Obama named several of Hillary Clinton's people to top positions. \"Heck,\" Clinton said, \"he even appointed Hillary.\" If there remain Obama-leaning undecided voters in Ohio, or in Michigan, or in any other battleground state after Clinton's stemwinder that ended in an onstage embrace with the current officeholder, it's unclear what more can be said. Well, with Clinton, there's always more to be said. Here's how he characterized the Republicans' economic plan: \"In Tampa, the Republican argument against the president's re-election was actually pretty simple \u2014 pretty snappy. It went something like this: We left him a total mess. He hasn't cleaned it up fast enough. So fire him and put us back in.\" The crowd in the arena roared. It will take a little longer to see how the folks at home in Ohio and Michigan react. But later, in the early hours of Thursday morning, Ohio delegates were given the honor of having their votes put Obama over the top as the nominee.",

The president also took some time out from politicking to visit a flood-damaged area in Louisiana that was hard hit by Hurricane Isaac.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: It's MORNING EDITION from NPR News. I'm Steve Inskeep. DAVID GREENE, HOST: And I'm David Greene. Having spent much of the summer hammering Mitt Romney, President Obama is working to sell his record this week. Yesterday, administration spokesmen insisted that Americans are better off than they were four years ago. INSKEEP: That's a change from the previous day's message, when key Obama backers would not make that claim. Yesterday, the president himself pointed to a success story. GREENE: In Ohio, the president highlighted the recovery of the nation's auto industry. He met autoworkers in Toledo, one of several stops on his way to the Democratic Convention in Charlotte. INSKEEP: Amid the campaigning, the president also conducted some official business, visiting an area hit by Hurricane Isaac in Louisiana. Here's NPR's Scott Horsley. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: President Obama traipsed through the Ridgewood neighborhood of St. John the Baptist Parish, northwest of New Orleans, where the floodwater is mostly gone now but the cleanup is just beginning. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: How y'all doing? EDWARD DIAZ: Better now. OBAMA: I know it's a mess. HORSLEY: Edward Diaz was one of the neighbors who shook hands with the president.  His front yard is piled with evidence from the storm surge that swept from one end of his house to the other, soaking everything in its path. DIAZ: We've spent three days taking out drywall, all the baseboards. And everything in the house, basically below four feet. HORSLEY: Like his neighbors, though, Diaz seems remarkably upbeat. Much of the waterlogged furniture drying outside in the sun is labeled Don't Take. Just like their sofas and sideboards, the residents of this area are here to stay. OBAMA: One thing you know about folks in Louisiana - they are resilient. People in Mississippi - they are resilient. HORSLEY: Mr. Obama says the government's immediate focus is on recovery efforts: temporary housing, reopening schools, and restoring transportation so people can get to work. The president also wants to figure out why parts of Louisiana that escaped Hurricane Katrina relatively unscathed suffered so much flooding in this storm. OBAMA: How do we make sure that an area like St. John's is protected when you have these kinds of disasters? HORSLEY: Mr. Obama was accompanied on his tour by Louisiana's Republican governor, Bobby Jindal, and both Louisiana senators - one Republican, one Democrat. White House spokesman Jay Carney says disaster relief is and should be apolitical. Still, there was plenty of partisan politics earlier in the day, when Mr. Obama hosted a Labor Day rally in Toledo, Ohio. CROWD: Obama. Obama. Obama. OBAMA: Thank you. CROWD: Obama. HORSLEY: Toledo is a major manufacturing center for both Chrysler and General Motors, and the city has shared in the automakers' recovery. Mr. Obama was quick to remind his audience that Mitt Romney opposed the government's auto rescue. Romney himself was in Ohio last week, telling voters that after a losing economic season, America needs a new head coach. Mr. Obama countered with his own football-inspired trash talk. OBAMA: He said he's going to be the coach that leads America to a winning season. (SOUNDBITE OF CROWD MURMURS) OBAMA: The problem is, everybody's already seen his economic playbook. HORSLEY: The president characterized the Republican playbook as tax cuts heavily tilted towards the wealthy, deregulation that would end some consumer protections, and changes to the Medicare system for future retirees that Mr. Obama described as a Hail Mary pass. OBAMA: And I've got one piece of advice for you about the Romney-Ryan game plan, Ohio. Punt it away. (APPLAUSE) OBAMA: It won't work.  It won't win the game. HORSLEY: Mr. Obama has promised to spell out his own, alternative game plan on Thursday, when he accepts the Democratic nomination for reelection. On Labor Day, with members of the UAW, the AFL-CIO, and the teachers union in his audience, Mr. Obama defended the role that organized labor has played in the U.S. He says Republicans are wrong to blame unions for our economic woes. OBAMA: This notion that we should have let the auto industry die and that we should pursue anti-worker policies, in the hopes that unions like yours will unravel,  it's part of the same old you're-on-your-own top-down philosophy that says we should just leave everybody to fend for themselves. HORSLEY: Mr. Obama says that's not the message he wants to send, to voters in Ohio or to the hurricane-drenched residents on the Gulf Coast. Scott Horsley, NPR News. Copyright \u00a9 2012 NPR.

            "article_content": "Rep. Paul Ryan stretched some truths Wednesday night when he accepted the Republican Party's 2012 vice presidential nomination, according to the fact checkers who parse politicians' words for news outlets and independent watchdogs: -- FactCheck.org found several problems with what Ryan said. Among them: Ryan \"accused President Obama's health care law of funneling money away from Medicare 'at the expense of the elderly.' In fact, Medicare's chief actuary says the law 'substantially improves' the system's finances, and Ryan himself has embraced the same savings.\" FactCheck also notes that Ryan \"accused Obama of doing \"exactly nothing\" about recommendations of a bipartisan deficit commission \u2014 which Ryan himself helped scuttle.\" Update at 11:45 a.m. ET: Ryan was in fact a member of that commission, but opposed its plan, \"arguing it didn't do enough to cut health care costs,\" as NPR's John Ydstie reported in December 2010. -- The Wisconsin congressman earned a \"false\" rating from PolitiFact.com on one statement. He got it for noting that then-candidate Barack Obama told the people of Janesville, Wis. (Ryan's home town) that the GM plant there would be open another 100 years if the government gave it the right support. \"That plant didn't last another year,\" Ryan said, implying that Obama broke a promise. Ryan didn't say that the plant actually closed in 2008, before Obama took office. Update at 11:45 a.m. ET: 93 Percent Of SUV Plant's Workers Were Let Go In December 2008. The Associated Press reported on April 19, 2009, that \"GM spokesman Christopher Lee confirmed operations at the southern Wisconsin plant will cease Thursday. About 1,200 employees were let go just before Christmas when GM ended SUV production at the plant. Some 100 workers were retained to finish an order of small- to medium-duty trucks for Isuzu Motors. Lee said most of those workers will be laid off Thursday. He said others will be kept on to help with the plant's shutdown.\" (Note: we messed up earlier and mistakenly put \"2009\" in the subhead above.) The local Gazette wrote in April 2009 that \"GM spokesman Chris Lee said another 40 to 50 employees in skilled trade\" would \"work to decommission the plant.\" In 1970, when Ryan was born, the plant employed 7,000 people. The newspaper's coverage of the plant closing is collected here. PolitiFact says the plant effectively \"closed while [President George W.] Bush was still in office, about a month before Obama was inaugurated.\" -- Ryan \"took some factual shortcuts,\" The Associated Press says. For instance, Ryan said the economic stimulus package passed in the early days of the Obama administration \"was a case of political patronage, corporate welfare and cronyism at their worst. You, the working men and women of this country, were cut out of the deal.\" The AP says that: \"Ryan himself asked for stimulus funds shortly after Congress approved the $800 billion plan, known as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. Ryan's pleas to federal agencies included letters to Energy Secretary Steven Chu and Labor Secretary Hilda Solis seeking stimulus grant money for two Wisconsin energy conservation companies.\" -- And as for the recurring \"we built it\" theme of the convention and Republicans' insistence that Obama doesn't think business people deserve credit for their successes \u2014 a line of attack Ryan returned to \u2014 The Washington Post's Fact Checker has now given the GOP \"four Pinocchios\" on that one. When the president said \"you didn't build that,\" the Post has concluded, he appeared \"to be making the unremarkable point that companies and entrepreneurs often benefit in some way from taxpayer support for roads, education and so forth. In other words, he [was] trying to make the case for higher taxes, and for why he believes the rich should pay more, which as we noted is part of a long Democratic tradition. He just did not put it very eloquently.\" Update at 3:30 p.m. ET: We've put together a post headlined \"Janesville Debate: Dissecting Ryan's Claim, Obama's 'Promise' & The Facts.\"",

Paul Ryan, the GOP vice presidential nominee, became a speech writer for the conservative Republican politician Jack Kemp after graduating from college in 1992.\n                \n                    \n                    J. Scott Applewhite/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Rep. Paul Ryan, the GOP vice presidential nominee, became a speech writer for the conservative Republican politician Jack Kemp after graduating from college in 1992. The second night of the Republican convention was an orchestrated buildup for Mitt Romney's running mate, Paul Ryan. Ryan emerged at the evening's end to deliver the payoff speech and introduce himself to a national audience. He did a rousing job of it, delivering the session's most memorable material with stark intensity. Outlining his many differences with President Obama on economics, the role of government and Medicare, Ryan was most believable as he declared: \"Our nation needs this debate. We want this debate. We will win this debate.\" That brought the convention crowd to its feet, as did any number of anti-Obama zingers. But Romney didn't choose Ryan just for his speaking skills. Ryan provides him with an eloquent advocate, to be sure, but other criteria were even more important. Ryan adds excitement to the GOP's presidential ticket. He is only 42, but the excitement is about something more than youthful vigor. Ryan turns on conservatives with his incandescent devotion to a set of ideas. He is steeped in his world view, and the electricity he exudes comes from his deep-seated sense of certainty. Ryan is a true believer, much like two previous politicians he has sought to emulate: Ronald Reagan and Jack Kemp. Ryan admired both while growing up, and when he graduated from college in 1992, he became a speech writer for Kemp. In Wednesday night's address, Ryan said he \"learned a good deal about economics, and about America\" from Jack Kemp, seen here in August 2006.\n                \n                    \n                    Rogelio V. Solis/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption In Wednesday night's address, Ryan said he \"learned a good deal about economics, and about America\" from Jack Kemp, seen here in August 2006. He saluted that influence early in his convention speech: \"I learned a good deal about economics, and about America, from the author of the Reagan tax reforms \u2014 the great Jack Kemp. What gave Jack that incredible enthusiasm was his belief in the possibilities of free people, in the power of free enterprise and strong communities to overcome poverty and despair. We need that same optimism right now.\" Ryan might as well have added that we need that same kind of economics right now. He clearly believes that we do. But not everyone thinks so, even among conservatives. Kemp was a walking controversy 30 years ago, when still a rising star in Congress. When Kemp was first peddling his magic \"supply side\" formula in the 1970s, he drew audiences primarily because he had been a star quarterback for the Buffalo Bills. Orthodox conservatives asked him how his tax cuts would affect the budget deficit (then measured in tens of billions of dollars per year) or the national debt (then approaching $1 trillion). Kemp said the tax cuts would promote so much economic growth that the deficit would shrink. Reagan bought into the theory and got Congress to enact a 25-point reduction in the income tax rates over three years. What followed was a decade in which the federal debt tripled to nearly $3 trillion, its largest peacetime expansion ever in percentage terms. Reagan would explain that he had not gotten the kind of spending cuts he wanted to go with the revenue reductions. But the deficit also grew because defense spending was expanded at a rate never seen before in peacetime. Kemp saw all this and never lost faith. Publicly, he still thought the booming economy justified the tax cuts. Privately, he went further, telling other legislators that deficits did not matter and that the GOP needed to \"stop being the party of root canal.\" Other Republicans and conservatives objected at the time, and many still do. Kemp often crossed swords with Reagan's first budget director, David Stockman, who hated deficits and debt enough to urge much tougher decisions on the White House, Congress and the voters themselves. Stockman fought his fight, lost and left the administration. Stockman has spent the past quarter-century in the private sector but still comments on the public side. He recently weighed in on the subject of Ryan's budget, an evolving set of proposals for lowering taxes on income and investment. Writing in The New York Times, Stockman called the Ryan plan \"an empty conservative sermon ... devoid of credible math or hard policy choices.\" Among other things, Stockman objected to Ryan giving a pass to defense spending, the same bugaboo that drove the deficit debate three decades ago. Beyond that, he writes: \"The Ryan plan boils down to a fetish for cutting the top marginal income-tax rate for 'job creators' \u2014 i.e. the superwealthy \u2014 to 25 percent, and paying for it with an as-yet-undisclosed plan to broaden the tax base.\" In the end, even Ryan himself does not say his plan will balance the budget anytime soon. Although the tax cuts would be immediate, the notional point of balance wouldn't come even in theory until 2040. That statement alone is enough to shock most of his supporters. But eliminating the deficit or reducing the existing debt is simply not the ultimate goal of the Ryan plan. Reducing it to a smaller percentage of the economy is considered important, but shrinking the size of nondefense government and reducing taxes are far more important. That's the same set of priorities Jack Kemp pursued in the Reagan era. Kemp died in 2009, five years after Reagan's death. But this week in Tampa, those priorities are alive again in the elevation of their acolyte from Wisconsin.",

            "article_content": "Republican vice presidential candidate Paul Ryan delivered a GOP convention takedown of President Obama Wednesday night. The speech catapulted an already ugly campaign to a whole new level.  DAVID GREENE, HOST: But now to Tampa, where this evening Mitt Romney will formally accept his party's nomination for president. Last night, though, the stage belonged to vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan. In a campaign, it often falls to the running mate to be the attack dog and Ryan sounded up for the job. It was also a chance for the rising GOP star to defend his own ideas. Here's NPR's national correspondent Mara Liasson. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Romney's choice of Paul Ryan generated a big boost of excitement for the ticket among Republicans - and last night Ryan lived up to the expectations. He did all the things a vice presidential nominee is supposed to do - starting with a vigorous defense of Romney himself, praising him for his ability, character and plain decency. (SOUNDBITE OF CONVENTION SPEECH) PAUL RYAN: His whole life prepared him for this moment - to meet serious challenges in a serious way, without excuses and idle words. After four years of getting the run-around, America needs a turnaround, and the man for the job is Governor Mitt Romney. LIASSON: Ryan was also introducing himself to a national audience for the first time, along with his family - wife Janna, his three kids, and his mom, Betty. (SOUNDBITE OF CONVENTION SPEECH) RYAN: I live on the same block where I grew up. We belong to the same parish where I was baptized. Janesville is that kind of place. LIASSON: Congressman Ryan does go home to Janesville, Wisconsin on the weekends, but he's spent more than half his entire life working in Washington - a career politician by any definition. Last night he delivered a sweeping attack on President Obama by starting with a note of sympathy. The president did come into office during an economic crisis, Ryan said, pointing out that his own home state voted for Mr. Obama in 2008. (SOUNDBITE OF CONVENTION SPEECH) RYAN: When he talked about change, many people liked the sound of it, especially in Janesville, where we were about to lose a major factory. A lot of guys I went to high school with worked at that GM plant. Right there at that plant, candidate Obama said: I believe that if our government is there to support you, this plant will be here for another hundred years. That's what he said in 2008.Well, as it turned out, that plant didn't last another year. LIASSON: Ryan left the impression that this was President Obama's fault. In fact, the   plant closed down in 2008, before Mr. Obama took office. Ryan also accused the president of racking up $5 trillion of new debt and ignoring the country's fiscal crisis. (SOUNDBITE OF CONVENTION SPEECH) RYAN: He created a new bipartisan debt commission. They came back with an urgent report. He thanked them, sent them on their way, and then did exactly nothing. LIASSON: What Ryan didn't say was that he was a member of that debt commission and voted against the recommendations in that urgent report. Ryan also repeated the charge that the president took $716 billion from Medicare and used it to fund Obamacare. We're going to stop that, Ryan said, neglecting to point out that his own budget takes the same $716 billion from Medicare. (SOUNDBITE OF CONVENTION SPEECH) RYAN: In Congress, when they take out the heavy books and the wall charts about Medicare, my thoughts go back to a house on Garfield Street in Janesville. My wonderful grandma, Janet, had Alzheimer's and she moved in with Mom and me. Though she felt lost at times, we did all the little things that made her feel loved. We had help from Medicare, and it was there, just like it's there for my mom today. Medicare is a promise and we will honor it. A Romney-Ryan administration will protect and strengthen Medicare for my mom's generation, for my generation, and for my kids and yours. LIASSON: Ryan didn't mention his own Medicare proposal, which would turn the program from a guaranteed fee for service health plan, into a means-tested voucher for future seniors to buy private insurance. Ryan did describe the broad outlines of his budget, which shrinks the size of government by curbing the cost of entitlements and other federal programs. And he laid out an ideological critique of the president's policies. (SOUNDBITE OF CONVENTION SPEECH) RYAN: None of us should have to settle for the best this administration offers - a dull, adventureless journey from one entitlement to the next, a government-planned life, a country where everything is free but us. LIASSON: This is the exact opposite of everything I learned growing up in Wisconsin, Ryan said - sounding like one of the Austrian economists he so admires. RYAN: When I was waiting tables, washing dishes or mowing lawns for money, I never thought of myself as stuck in some station in life. I was on my own path, my own journey, an American journey, where I could think for myself, decide for myself, define happiness for myself. That's what we do in this country. That's the American dream. That's freedom and I'll take it any day over the supervision and sanctimony of the central planners. LIASSON: While Ryan is well-known in Washington as the intellectual leader of a new generation of Republicans, he's not well-known around the country. And he's young - at 42, the same age as Romney's oldest son. (SOUNDBITE OF CONVENTION SPEECH) RYAN: We're a full generation apart, Governor Romney and I, and in some ways we're different. There are the songs on his iPod, which I've heard on the campaign bus and I've heard it on many hotel elevators. LIASSON: In addition to Ryan, the delegates heard from other GOP stars, like New Mexico Governor Susanna Martinez, the most prominent elected Republican Latina. And they heard from the party's most prominent African-American woman, former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. She delivered a strong speech on foreign policy that the delegates loved, but she also challenged them by defending George W. Bush's plan to provide a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants, a position at odds with the views of this convention and the current ticket. (SOUNDBITE OF CONVENTION SPEECH) CONDOLEEZZA RICE: We need immigration laws that protect our borders, meet our economic needs, and yet show that we are a compassionate nation of immigrants. LIASSON: Mike Huckabee, the former governor, Baptist preacher and current Fox News talk show host, who ran against Romney in 2008, offered an important endorsement aimed at conservative evangelicals who consider Romney's Mormon religion to be a cult. Huckabee said I care far less where Mitt Romney takes his family to church than I do about where he takes this country. (SOUNDBITE OF CONVENTION SPEECH) MIKE HUCKABEE: People wonder whether guys like me, an evangelical, would only support a fellow evangelical. Well, my friends, I want to tell you something. Of the four people on the two tickets, the only self-professed evangelical is Barack Obama, and he supports changing the definition of marriage, believes that human life is disposable and expendable at any time in the womb, even beyond the womb, and he tells people of faith that they have to bow their knees to the god of government and violate their faith and conscience in order to comply with what he calls health care. LIASSON: But the night belonged to Paul Ryan, who told the crowd this election would be more than a referendum on President Obama. (SOUNDBITE OF CONVENTION SPEECH) RYAN: You are entitled to the clearest possible choice, because the time for choosing is drawing near. So here is our pledge: We will not duck the tough issues, we will lead. We will not spend the next four years blaming others. We will take responsibility. We will not try to replace our founding principles. We will reapply our founding principles. LIASSON: All the convention lacks now is the climactic speech by the man at the top of the ticket, and tonight Mitt Romney takes the stage in Tampa to accept the nomination of his party and launch his fall campaign.

            "article_content": "With a jutting chin and growing fearlessness, Republican vice presidential candidate Paul Ryan delivered a GOP convention takedown of President Obama Wednesday night, catapulting an already ugly campaign to a whole new level. At times pugnacious, at times seemingly emotional (he wiped away tears when talking about his mother), Ryan, 42, a Wisconsin congressman, used his well-crafted speech to characterize the nation's president and his bright promise as old, played out. \"A ship trying to sail on yesterday's wind,\" was one of many ways he put it, to the roar of those who packed the Tampa arena. Later, he referred to \"the fading Obama poster\" in the room of the mythical 20-something who can't find work and is still living with the parents. To hear Ryan tell it, four years never seemed so long ago. It was clearly plenty of time for a true and public rivalry to develop with Obama, 51, Ryan's nemesis since the men locked horns over the president's health care overhaul. Carol Hurst of Merritt Island, Fla., listens to a speaker on Wednesday at the Republican National Convention.\n                \n                    \n                    Becky Lettenberger/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Carol Hurst of Merritt Island, Fla., listens to a speaker on Wednesday at the Republican National Convention. And if there remained any question whether he and GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney, who will speak Thursday, will attempt to turn the debate over Medicare changes to their favor, Ryan dispelled it. \"We want this debate. We will win this debate,\" said Ryan, who has proposed turning the entitlement program into a voucher system instead of a guaranteed benefits program that remains under the president's health care law. (The Obama campaign also believes it will win, and shortly after Ryan wrapped up, sent out a fundraising email touting Obamacare.) Ryan also provided context better than anyone has at this week's convention for the GOP blowback Obama has received for his \"you didn't build that\" line in a recent speech, during which he asserted that government plays a role in business success. Here's how Ryan put it: \"All the corner shops in our towns and cities, the restaurants, cleaners, gyms, hair salons, hardware stores \u2014 these didn't come out of nowhere. A lot of heart goes into each one. And if small-business people say they made it on their own, all they are saying is that nobody else worked seven days a week in their place. Nobody showed up in their place to open the door at five in the morning. Nobody did their thinking, and worrying, and sweating for them. After all that work, and in a bad economy, it sure doesn't help to hear from their president that government gets the credit. What they deserve to hear is the truth: Yes, you did build that.\" While it may very well be true that Obama's comment was taken out of context, and that, indeed, government does play a role in creating a climate and infrastructure businesses need, this argument, as laid out by Ryan, looms large and problematic for the president. A delegate shows his support for Paul Ryan on a night dominated by the acceptance speech of the vice presidential nominee.\n                \n                    \n                    Becky Lettenberger/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption A delegate shows his support for Paul Ryan on a night dominated by the acceptance speech of the vice presidential nominee. Fact checkers were certainly kept busy parsing Ryan's many claims about the alleged failures of Obama's tenure \u2014 as well as Ryan's own role voting for government programs that have driven up the debt and deficits he now rails against. (Just as they will remain busy through the Democrats' convention next week.) But the speech seems destined to become a template for the campaign going into the final weeks. \"It's like a big pep rally,\" said Sara Canady, an alternate delegate from Texas, over the roar of the crowd. \"He's preparing us and motivating us to go home and share this message.\" Said Paul Hurst, a delegate from Hawaii: \"He clearly defined Gov. Romney and provided a clear contrast to the current president.\" If the current president was watching Ryan Wednesday night, he would be left with little doubt that it's on. Again.",

Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, seen at a weekend rally in Powell, Ohio, is set to formally accept the GOP nomination to become Mitt Romney's running mate.\n                \n                    \n                    Jewel Samad/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, seen at a weekend rally in Powell, Ohio, is set to formally accept the GOP nomination to become Mitt Romney's running mate. Like a lot of Republicans, Jane Jech is excited about Paul Ryan. Maybe even more excited than she is about Mitt Romney. Ryan, a seven-term representative from Wisconsin and the chairman of the House Budget Committee, will formally accept the Republican Party's nomination for vice president on Wednesday. His speech is expected to touch on all the hallmarks he's emphasized since getting the nod as running mate on Aug. 11, including the need to get the federal deficit under control, in part by curbing entitlement programs like Medicare. That's just fine with Jech, a Republican candidate for state Senate in Iowa. Like many voters in her state, her first choice for president was former Sen. Rick Santorum, but the Ryan pick has helped bring her around with regard to Romney, the former Massachusetts governor and now the GOP presidential nominee. \"We want to see consistency in Romney \u2014 that's been a big question,\" Jech says. \"He helped himself with Ryan.\" Jech is not alone. Ryan has a consistently conservative record on social issues such as abortion and same-sex marriage, and he is considered a hero among fiscal conservatives for his budget plan, which has twice been endorsed by the House. \"I think the pick was great,\" says Gary Bauer, president of American Values and a candidate for the GOP nomination back in 2000. \"It's no secret that Romney was not the first choice of a lot of conservatives,\" Bauer says. \"It was wise for him to go with a running mate that conservatives do have strong positive feelings about.\" But if Ryan was an effective pick in terms of exciting the GOP base \u2014 and recent polls suggest he might help put his home state in play this fall \u2014 some analysts wonder whether he will ultimately hinder Romney in terms of reaching out to swing voters. Ryan's budget would cut the deficit in part by putting a cap on Medicare spending per recipient. Although Republicans insist Ryan's plan will take a back seat to Romney's when it comes to the health insurance program for the elderly, other recent polls nonetheless reflect that the issue has hurt the GOP ticket, notably in some key battleground states such as Ohio and Florida, as well as Wisconsin. \"Now everyone is talking about Paul Ryan, his budget and Medicare \u2014 that's not what Republicans want to be talking about,\" says William Schneider, a public policy professor at George Mason University. \"The Republican campaign should be about the economy and [President] Obama's job performance, period.\" Ryan's injection of \"controversial new subjects\" into the campaign makes him a \"net minus\" for the ticket thus far, says Schneider, who is also a senior fellow with the centrist think tank Third Way. Republicans dismiss that line of argument. Ryan not only excites GOP voters but also ensures the campaign will be about \"big ideas\" such as the size and scope of government, says Republican consultant John Hancock. \"The entitlement reform was going to be a central component of the Democrats' messaging strategy,\" Hancock says. \"We now have put on the ticket the guy who is the most articulate and effective at defining what he's doing.\" Romney and Ryan both have tried to go on the offense regarding Medicare, insisting that they will \"preserve\" the program, while Obama has cut its spending levels to pay for his broader health care agenda. But if Democrats were always going to try to hang Ryan's budget and Medicare plans around Romney's neck, Ryan's addition to the GOP ticket made it that much easier. \"The more Republicans are talking about Medicare and not the economy, they're fighting on Democratic turf,\" says Lewis Gould, an emeritus professor of history at the University of Texas. Gould says he expects the Ryan \"bounce\" in Wisconsin will be ephemeral. Regardless of whether he ends up being a net plus or a net minus overall for the Republican ticket, its fortunes will mainly rise or fall with Romney's performance. Running mates, as much attention as they get, rarely determine the outcome of presidential elections. Perhaps not since Lyndon Johnson in 1960 has there been a vice presidential pick who has made a real difference, Schneider says. And the polls nationwide have not moved much since Ryan's selection. \"The Republican base is happy with him, which is very important,\" says Jack Pitney, a government professor at Claremont McKenna College. \"I think overall he's going to be a slight help to the ticket, but not the proverbial game-changer,\" Pitney says. \"In the end, the impact of a vice presidential candidate is usually very marginal.\"",

The event was billed as \"Newt U.\" With Tropical Storm Isaac pushing the official start of the Republican National Convention off until Tuesday, delegates gathering in Tampa spent part of the day going back to school \u2014 \"Newt U,\" to be precise. The event was hosted by former House speaker and one-time history professor Newt Gingrich. It was billed as \"a series of public policy workshops for delegates designed to support and expound upon the overall messages of the convention.\" In layman's terms, the course was intended to help sharpen the way delegates get the party's message out and provide tactics to disarm their opponents. \"One of the great failures of Republicans, candidly, is that we tell the truth less effectively than Democrats lie,\" Gingrich told delegates gathered Monday in a Hyatt Regency ballroom. \"And we are so startled by their dishonesty that we're sort of tongue-tied.\" Monday's lessons covered themes ranging from the economy and leadership to Medicare. And Gingrich had plenty of help in getting through the day's syllabus. Guest lectures included Utah Gov. Gary Herbert; Larry Kudlow, a host on CNBC's The Kudlow Report; and Lanhee Chen, who serves as Mitt Romney's policy director. Many times Monday, the lessons served as attack lines intended to energize the delegates. Take, for instance, the jab delivered by Illinois Rep. Aaron Schock: \"The reason I'm so positive about this year's election is because we have men who have demonstrated the ability not to lay out plans, but more importantly to be able to get out action,\" said Schock. \"You know, there's a lot of talk about leadership. A leader who is leading with no one following is just a man out for a walk. And we've had a president the last couple of years who's been a man out for a walk.\" Later, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker spoke about why he believes in limited government. \"We understood, in our campaign, we talked about the fact that people create jobs not the government,\" said Walker, who won a recall election in June. \"So it'd be nice if the leader in Washington understood that people create jobs, not the government. And so we got government out of the way.\" \"Newt U\" was to resume classes Tuesday at a \"We Built It\" event focusing on small businesses. Gingrich's wife, Callista Gingrich, was billed as one of the featured speakers. Brakkton Booker is an assistant producer for NPR's Washington Desk.",

            "article_content": "Republicans have decided to delay the official start of their presidential nominating convention until Tuesday. Tropical Storm Isaac is causing weather-related issues around Tampa, Florida. As the convention is about to begin, polls show GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney is tied with President Obama.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: On the final Monday of August, it's MORNING EDITION, from NPR News. I'm Steve Inskeep. DAVID GREENE, HOST: And I'm David Greene. The Republican National Convention will not start today as scheduled.  Tropical Storm Isaac and an abundance of caution will cause the convention to start a day late. INSKEEP: Mitt Romney will arrive at that convention, though, with a chance to win the presidency. Despite a summer of awkward headlines, a much-debated running mate and days of distractions, Romney trails by only a point or two when you average out recent national polls. Now, Republicans work to aim their fire at President Obama. Here's NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Even at a shortened three days with the TV networks cutting their coverage to just one hour a night, Tampa offers a huge opportunity for Mitt Romney. He'll finally control the script, a chance to move beyond distracting discussions about rape or birth certificates. Even as the delegates streamed into Tampa, Romney was working the moment, sitting for a series of TV interviews meant to reveal what's behind his sometimes stiff and awkward exterior. GREENE: Yesterday, he let Fox News film him flipping pancakes with his grandson at his summer home in New Hampshire. But even in this moment, the job of humanizing him was left largely to his wife, Ann. (SOUNDBITE OF FOX NEWS BROADCAST) LIASSON: The convention planners have taken a number of steps to warm up the reticent Romney image. They've built a wood-paneled set to look like a living room - a friendly contrast, says Republican strategist Ed Rogers, to the bitter campaign. ED ROGERS: He's been through a very unflattering year. The Republican primary process was hand-to-hand, ugly combat. He came right out of that with Obama pounding him as an out-of-touch billionaire, a corporate raider. LIASSON: In Tampa, says Rogers, Romney can tell his own story about Bain Capital, managing the Olympics and governing Massachusetts. ROGERS: I think that he can set a good contrast with Obama starting this week. Obama, what was cool four years ago, has become smug. And I think a contrast to that, to be a happy warrior is part of what Romney's got to do at his convention. LIASSON: The Obama campaign is trying to make that as difficult as possible. A new Web ad ridicules Romney for having the highest negative personal ratings of any challenger to an incumbent president. (SOUNDBITE OF POLITICAL ADVERTISEMENT) LIASSON: One thing Romney doesn't have to worry about is getting his party behind him. Choosing Paul Ryan for vice president took care of that. The Ryan pick may not have given the GOP ticket much of a  bounce nationally, but it's also true that Ryan, who supports changing Medicare  into a voucher  program, has yet to be the big negative Democrats hoped he would be with seniors in states like Florida. Ryan has helped tighten the race in one battleground: his own home state of Wisconsin, says Brian Schimming, the vice chair of the state GOP. BRIAN SCHIMMING: It's huge energy. The last two polls that came out both had Romney and Ryan up by one. So I think what you're seeing here is about a five-to-seven point bump. At least for now, those numbers are sticking. LIASSON: At the Mainsail Hotel here in Tampa, the Ohio delegation is getting ready for a night out on the town. Ohio state party chair Bob Bennett says for all the attention both parties have paid to their loyalists, this is the week for Romney to start targeting undecided voters, the key to winning swing states like Ohio. BOB BENNETT: The target voter is really a voter who considers himself an independent voter, who thinks about the issues and may have voted of Barack Obama in 2008, I think it's just the opposite now, is that President Obama has had four years to address those problems that concern the people, and frankly, they haven't been addressed. LIASSON: As for Tropical Storm Isaac, Republicans like Brian Schimming are confident it won't disrupt the convention and may even draw more voters to the news. SCHIMMING: People tend to like to watch big weather events, so they'll do that. And a lot of the coverage about this weather event is also about the convention itself. So, actually, it's not going to hurt much. It might help a little. It might be the lead-in story. LIASSON: The lead-in to what Republicans hope will be the big story of the week: Mitt Romney's national debut as the nominee of the Republican Party. Mara Liasson, NPR News, Tampa.

The dueling strategies show how the campaigns are tailoring their ad message to specific voters, especially in the battleground states. Florida And Medicare In his first trip to the Sunshine State as a vice presidential candidate last weekend, Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin focused almost exclusively on Medicare. Ryan spoke at The Villages, a sprawling 55-plus retirement community. He and his 78-year-old mother (who lives in Florida) stood under a banner reading, \"Protect and Strengthen Medicare.\" \"We will end the raid of Medicare, we will restore the promise of this program,\" Ryan said, accusing Obama of taking $716 billion out of the program to help pay for the Affordable Care Act. The Romney campaign used Ryan's meeting with his mother, and the claim of $716 billion in Medicare cuts (which the fact-checking site PolitiFact rated \"Mostly False\"), to create a Web ad. The Obama campaign thinks it has a winner subject with Medicare, too. Its new radio ad in Florida features elderly narrators saying, \"In Florida, they're already talking about how the Ryan-Romney plan will end Medicare and replace it with a voucher.\" Again, PolitiFact gives this claim a \"Mostly False\" rating. Seniors make up about a quarter of the electorate in Florida \u2014 a higher percentage than in almost any other state. But political scientist Susan MacManus of the University of South Florida questions the senior focus, especially for Obama. \"It's stupid,\" she said. MacManus says most seniors have already made up their minds. And in general, they're befuddled by the conflicting claims about Medicare. \"The nonstop ads on Medicare are confusing them,\" she said, \"so they end up believing their own candidate.\" She says Obama won Florida narrowly in 2008 by turning out young people and minorities \u2014 and that's where he should focus his efforts. New Hampshire and Student Loans The radio spot airing in New Hampshire, called \"Parent's Voice,\" takes aim at the Ryan budget plan and its cuts to Pell Grants, the federally funded higher education aid program. Narrated by a concerned-sounding mother worried about her son (\"Andrew goes back to school pretty soon; we sure need that Pell Grant\"), the ad is out to link the Romney/Ryan ticket to cuts in higher education spending made by local Republicans. Democrats say the Ryan budget that passed the House but failed in the Senate would have cost 1 million students their Pell Grants. Republicans says reductions to the grants, which max out at $5,550, would not be immediate or across the board. The Romney campaign, whose ads in New Hampshire have focused on the economy, says the ads are an attempt to distract from the president's own record. \"Under President Obama, school quality has declined, college tuition costs have skyrocketed and his economic policies have made it harder to get jobs,\" said Romney spokesman Ryan Williams. So why is this ad airing in New Hampshire? Here are a few reasons: New Hampshire has always been stingy when it comes to funding higher education, but last year the GOP-controlled Legislature made the deepest cuts to state higher education funding in the country, 42 percent. And the state already ranked last in the country in per capita college and university funding. According to the Project on Student Debt, New Hampshire also ranks first in average student debt, at $31,048 per capita, and second in proportion of students carrying debt, at 74 percent. With the new budget cuts driving up the cost of attending a state-funded school by around 10 percent, those numbers aren't likely to improve. New Hampshire Democrats have made the cuts to higher education a rallying cry against a state Legislature they say is \"too extreme.\" There is some indication that argument may be taking root. A University of New Hampshire survey center poll in April found that voters consider the Republican Legislature the state's second-largest problem. Whether the Obama campaign intends this ad to mainly shore up Democratic support or to sow doubt among potential swing voters is unclear. The campaign isn't commenting. University of New Hampshire pollster Andy Smith thinks the message is likely to resonate mostly with people already voting for Obama. But, he says, the ads could also work among a coveted segment of the 2012 electorate: middle-aged female swing voters. \"They are probably trying to get the women, who tend to be more concerned about these issues then men are,\" Smith said.

            "article_content": "With a towering federal deficit, the role of the government was always destined to be an important issue in the presidential campaign. Republican candidate Mitt Romney's decision to tap Paul Ryan \u2014 author of a proposed budget that would dramatically reduce the size of government \u2014 made it front and center. This week, President Obama has begun a systematic campaign to remind voters of just what government does and can do for them.  MELISSA BLOCK, HOST: At his White House briefing this week, President Obama himself took issue with Mitt Romney's welfare claim. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: You can't just make stuff up. That's one thing you learn as president of the United States. You get called into account. And I feel very comfortable with the fact that when you look at the campaign we're running, we are focused on the issues and the differences that matter to working families all across America. BLOCK: This fight over welfare underscores a fundamental difference in how the two candidates and their supporters see the role of government. While Mitt Romney suggests government is giving handouts to the undeserving, President Obama stresses more popular programs that benefit students, seniors, and frustrated commuters just trying to get to work. Here's NPR's Scott Horsley. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: President Obama held a roundtable with schoolteachers in Nevada this morning. Like the firefighters he visited in Colorado in June, Mr. Obama sees teachers as a popular and recognizable face of what government does. OBAMA: I see how hard you guys work. And I know that you don't do it for the money. (LAUGHTER) OBAMA: You're doing it 'cause you really deeply care about these kids. HORSLEY: Teachers in Nevada and elsewhere have seen their class sizes balloon, as cash-strapped state and local governments cut back. Mr. Obama has proposed additional federal funding to help keep more teachers on the payroll. In Ohio yesterday, Mr. Obama talked about the larger Pell Grants and tax credits he pushed through, to make college more affordable. He calls that an investment in young people and says the benefits don't stop with them. OBAMA: Now more than ever, your success is America's success. Because when we invest in your future, we're investing in America's future. HORSLEY: Mr. Obama campaign is build around the message that government is not just a distant tax collector, showering favors on undeserving strangers. Rather, it's the schools that teach our children and the doctors and drugs that treat our parents. OBAMA: I have made reforms that have saved millions of seniors with Medicare hundreds of dollars on their prescription drugs. (APPLAUSE) HORSLEY: Even the roads we drive on are a government project, Mr. Obama reminds voters. A new radio ad in Virginia warns that project could suffer under the big spending cuts proposed by Mitt Romney and his running mate Paul Ryan. (SOUNDBITE OF A POLITICAL AD) HORSLEY: On the stump, Mr. Obama often tempers his speeches with a dose of modesty about what government can and can't do. And whoever is president will have to wrestle with a budget deficit that demands some combination of reduced spending and higher taxes. Still, the president pushes back strongly against the anti-government rhetoric of his GOP opponents. OBAMA: Government can't solve every problem and it shouldn't try. And it certainly can't help folks who aren't willing to help themselves. CROWD: Right. OBAMA: But there are some things that we can do together as a people that makes us all better off, that makes our country strong. HORSLEY: Every Obama rally ends with the Bruce Springsteen anthem, \"We Take Care Of Our Own.\" Part of the president's challenge in responding to Romney's welfare attack is persuading Americans that the people government is taking care of really are our own.

Miller Middle School in Marshalltown, Iowa, on August 14. Read Another Opinion On Medicare Fred Barnes is executive editor of The Weekly Standard. President Obama is creative. He's given up on a palpable falsehood about the Romney-Ryan plan to reform Medicare. But he's retained a few old canards and trotted out a new one. The new charge? In his speech in Dubuque, Iowa, on Wednesday, he said: \"My plan reduces the cost of Medicare by cracking down on fraud and waste and subsidies to insurance companies.\" But roughly 80 percent of Medicare benefits are dispensed by the federal government, not insurance companies. And while Obama's health care law would ultimately kill the Medicare Advantage program, under which seniors choose private insurance providers, the president is keeping it alive, at least through the election, with an emergency $8 billion subsidy. The old canards? Obama said Medicare would not be guaranteed for seniors under Romney-Ryan. Sorry, but it would. And he said his reforms in Obamacare \"will not touch your Medicare benefits \u2014 not by a dime.\" But they're bound to. A White House spokesman insists the $716 billion in reductions in Medicare spending \"do not cut a single guaranteed benefit.\" However, they'll cut fees to providers \u2014 hospitals and doctors \u2014 which will cause cuts in services to Medicare beneficiaries. Yes, seniors would still have their benefit, but it would be more difficult to use. Obama also noted that a Medicare plan \"authored\" by Ryan would \"force seniors to pay an extra $6,400 a year.\" This is both an exaggeration and irrelevant in the current presidential race. The Romney-Ryan plan is different. Under it, the $6,400 problem, to the extent there was one, is eliminated. Obama's claim is that the Congressional Budget Office looked at the first Ryan budget in 2011 with its Medicare reform plan. That's true, but things are more complicated. CBO assumed the rise of health care costs would not be slowed at all and that the premium support benefit wouldn't keep pace. By 2022, the gap between the Medicare benefit and its actual cost could be as much as $6,400. But the assumption of rising costs was wrongheaded. The whole purpose of the reform plan was to use free market competition to hold down the cost increases. CBO ignored this, thus reaching an unjustified conclusion. In any case, the plan embraced by Romney and Ryan today uses an annual competitive bidding process among insurance providers to determine the cost of the premium support payment to seniors. In selecting a plan, seniors would be able to choose at least one option with no added out of pocket costs. Sorry for that tedious explanation. There's a more important point. What Obama talked about in Dubuque was a discarded plan, not today's Romney-Ryan plan. His implication was that the plan dropped a year ago by Ryan is on the table now. It's not. But let's give Obama a bit of credit. He seems to have abandoned the charge that Ryan would have cut $716 billion from Medicare just like he has. Ryan wouldn't have, nor would he and Romney now.",

            "article_content": "For a week now, charges and counter charges have flown on the campaign trail about who would do what to Medicare. Did President Obama really cut $700 billion from the program? Does Republican challenger Mitt Romney really support a voucher system to replace the current program?  DAVID GREENE, HOST: It's MORNING EDITION, from NPR News. Good morning. I'm David Greene. RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: And I'm Renee Montagne. Forget the glossy TV ads. The political fight over Medicare is now being waged with humble white boards. Mitt Romney used a dry-erase board in South Carolina yesterday to illustrate his argument that President Obama is, quote, \"raiding\" Medicare to finance the new health care law. Hours later, the Obama campaign responded with a white board of its own, saying Romney's Medicare plan would cost future seniors thousands of dollars a year. NPR's Scott Horsley has been reading between the felt-tipped lines to see what the dueling plans would really mean for Medicare, now and in the future. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Mitt Romney knew when he picked Paul Ryan as his running mate that he'd be challenged over Ryan's controversial plan to replace Medicare with a voucher system. So all this week, Romney has been a launching preemptive attack on President Obama's approach to Medicare. At a press conference in Greer, South Carolina yesterday, Romney introduced a visual aid. (SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE) HORSLEY: Using a dry-erase marker and a white board, Romney sketched out a comparison between the Republican plan and Mr. Obama's for people who are on Medicare now, or soon will be, and for those who are at least a decade away from retirement. (SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE) HORSLEY: The president's health care law does reduce Medicare spending by more than $700 billion over the next decade. But that savings is supposed to come from insurance companies, hospitals, drug makers and the like, not from cutting basic services to the 48 million Americans who are on Medicare. Still, health care expert Joseph Antos of the conservative American Enterprise Institute warns seniors may find it more difficult to get the care they want. JOSEPH ANTOS: If you take enough money out of the Medicare program, eventually you will run into access problems for senior citizens. There's just no two ways around that. HORSLEY: Romney has promised to undo the president's health care law, and put that $700 billion-plus back into Medicare. But doing away with Obamacare would also mean getting rid of some special help for seniors, says Medicare expert Tricia Neuman of the Kaiser Family Foundation. TRICIA NEUMAN: The other thing that was in the health reform law were provisions that actually improved coverage by expanding the prescription drug benefit in the Donut Hole. HORSLEY: Mr. Obama told supporters in Iowa this week that measure is already saving money for millions of seniors who take pricey prescription drugs. The president's also sparring with Republicans over how to handle future Medicare for people retiring at least a decade from now. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) HORSLEY: That $6,400 figure is an estimate from the Congressional Budget Office of the additional costs seniors could face if the price of health insurance goes up faster than their government vouchers. Antos, of the American Enterprise Institute, says Republicans are counting on competition to keep insurance prices in check. ANTOS: The whole point of this is to provide a new set of incentives that would cause the health sector to reform itself. HORSLEY: The president's plan also tries to deliver savings. It includes numerous pilot programs aimed at finding more efficient ways to deliver care. And it sets up an expert advisory board to recommend changes to Medicare if costs go up too quickly. But while the Republican plan would shift any excess costs onto seniors, the president's plan requires that savings be found elsewhere in the health care system. Here's Kaiser's Tricia Neuman. NEUMAN: The idea of constraining Medicare spending is one that has been put forward by both sides. But how they would go about constraining the growth in spending differs quite a bit. HORSLEY: The president and his Republican challenger have both tried to assure today's seniors nothing will change with their Medicare. But experts say some kind of change is inevitable if the program's to be preserved for decades to come. Scott Horsley, NPR News, Washington. Copyright \u00a9 2012 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "When Republican Mitt Romney tapped House budget chairman Paul Ryan to be his vice presidential running mate, the decision forced both campaigns to focus on Medicare. The Ryan pick was a 180-degree turn from Romney's original premise, which was to focus exclusively on President Obama and the economy.  DAVID GREENE, HOST: It's MORNING EDITION from NPR News. Good morning. I'm David Greene. RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: And I'm Renee Montagne. When Mitt Romney put Paul Ryan on the ticket, it had the potential to reset the presidential race - that is, offer a choice between two radically different visions of government, in a campaign seemingly stuck in tit-for-tat attacks over the economy. So far, though, the campaigns have a somewhat different fight on their hands. NPR's Mara Liasson reports. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: One thing the Ryan pick has done is force both campaigns to focus on Medicare, an issue that hasn't been front and center. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: I've proposed reforms that will save Medicare money by getting rid of wasteful spending in the healthcare system, reforms that will not touch your Medicare benefits, not by a dime. LIASSON: President Obama, campaigning in Iowa yesterday, was responding to new attacks from the Romney campaign accusing him of cutting $716 billion from Medicare. (SOUNDBITE OF AD) LIASSON: The Romney campaign's idea is to pit Obamacare, the massive new government program seniors in general don't like, against Medicare, the massive old government program they do like. But there was just one little problem with that strategy. Paul Ryan's budget also cuts Medicare by the same $716 billion, mostly to provider reimbursements. On CBS yesterday, Romney said that part of Ryan's plan was no longer operative. MITT ROMNEY: Those cuts are going to be restored if I become president and Paul Ryan becomes vice president. LIASSON: The Ryan pick was a 180 degree turn from Romney's original premise of the race, which was to focus exclusively on President Obama and the economy. And it's taken a while for the Romney campaign to adjust. This week you could sometimes see the gears clunking awkwardly into place. First, Romney had to iron out the differences between his broad principles on the budget and Ryan's detailed blueprint. Then the campaign had to figure out what to do about Medicare. Weekly Standard editor Bill Kristol was one of the conservatives who pushed hard for Romney to pick Ryan. BILL KRISTOL: The key move they made was to say, hey, let's have an Obamacare fight. Now Medicare's also potentially a Republican vulnerability, so it's not like, you know, either side's going to roll over for the other, but at least it's a fight. LIASSON: Indeed, instead of rolling over, the Obama campaign is up on its hind legs begging for more. It sees a juicy opportunity in the Ryan plan, which would change Medicare from an insurance program that pays medical bills into a program where future seniors would get a fixed amount of money to buy private insurance. The Obama campaign released this web video featuring Florida seniors. (SOUNDBITE OF WEB VIDEO) LIASSON: Medicare has historically been a potent weapon for Democrats. But in 2010, many Republicans attacked the Medicare cuts in Obamacare and the GOP won 60 percent of elderly voters. PAUL RYAN: The president, I'm told, is talking about Medicare today. LIASSON: One Republican eager to try that again is Paul Ryan himself, who was campaigning in Ohio yesterday. RYAN: We need this debate and we will win this debate. LIASSON: Ryan followed the instructions sent out Monday by the National Republican Congressional Committee. Their memo told GOP candidates to never use the words privatize or entitlement reform. Instead it says say preserve, protect, strengthen or save. RYAN: This is one area where this election presents such a clear contrast. Governor Romney and I will protect and strengthen Medicare for our current seniors and for our future seniors of tomorrow. LIASSON: Republican pollster Matthew Dowd wonders if the Romney campaign is ready for a prolonged debate about Medicare. MATTHEW DOWD: I don't get a sense for the next 70 days they want to make this about entitlements and about the fiscal problem in Washington and about the budget. I don't get a sense they want to change their whole strategy to a discussion of that when that issue isn't even in the top three or four issues in the country right now. LIASSON: But that's the debate that you get when you put Paul Ryan on the ticket. And how this new debate about fiscal policy plays out will help answer another question - was putting Paul Ryan on the ticket a smart move or not? GOP strategist Ed Rogers. ED ROGERS: It certainly filled the news hole. Nobody's chasing Romney around about his tax returns right now. It's all about Ryan. So, so far he's served a worthwhile purpose. But my history is the vice presidential nominees after being shot out of a cannon fade pretty quickly. And so is Ryan going to follow that path or is something new happening? I think the jury's still out on that. LIASSON: The Ryan pick has given a jolt of excitement to the Romney campaign, and it's given the presidential race a chance to be about something bigger than personal attacks. The next few weeks will determine whether this unusual move, where the nominee essentially adopts the vision of his number two, was more risk or reward. Mara Liasson, NPR News.

Biden seized on Republican challenger Mitt Romney's choice of Rep. Paul Ryan as a running mate. Biden said it shows what the Republican ticket really stands for.  RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: It's MORNING EDITION, from NPR News. I'm Renee Montagne. DAVID GREENE, HOST: And I'm David Greene. Good morning. Well, it is VP against VP-hopeful. Vice President Joe Biden is touring Virginia, a key presidential swing state. And yesterday, Biden seized on Mitt Romney's choice of Congressman Paul Ryan as a running mate, saying it shows what the Republican ticket really stands for. In a moment, Ryan's day on the campaign trail. First to NPR's Larry Abramson, who's traveling with Vice President Biden. LARRY ABRAMSON, BYLINE: Some in the handpicked crowd of Obama supporters gathered in Danville, Virginia say they know who Paul Ryan is. Retired teacher Crystal Gregory says she knows just what Ryan has in store. CRYSTAL GREGORY: Because I have read the Ryan budget. ABRAMSON: Crystal Gregory says she's supporting the Obama ticket because the budget plan proposed by Congressman Ryan - which never became law - would change Medicare into a voucher program. GREGORY: And since the mission of the Ryan budget is to change Medicare as we know it, and the mission of many people in the Republican Party is to privatize Social Security. I want to make sure that that doesn't happen. ABRAMSON: The vice president picked up on that concern. He took the stage at a local institute meant to spur job growth here, in an area still suffering from the loss of dying industries like textiles and furniture manufacturing. Biden said the selection of Ryan confirms that the loyalties of the likely Republican nominee are to Wall Street. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) ABRAMSON: The crowd's reaction was muted, but the Romney campaign quickly seized on the statement, saying it marked, quote, \"a new low.\" Romney himself later said this in Ohio. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) ABRAMSON: The implication was that Biden was appealing to the fears of African-Americans, who easily made up half the audience, but neither campaign made any direct reference to race. The Biden tour moved on. : I'd love some of your world famous hot dogs. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: All right. : That's not a punishment, man. (APPLAUSE) ABRAMSON: At the Coffee Break Restaurant in Stuart, Virginia, Biden did the eat-some-local-food thing. Then he stepped outside and went after the female vote. He pointed his blues at one woman and asked: Where did you get those eyes? : You are trouble. I can tell. (LAUGHTER) UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Oh, yes. She is trouble. : Your mom and your dad... ABRAMSON: The Veep regaled the rest of the crowd with more attacks on the Romney team, for backing tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans. He spoke to them of his blue collar roots, and showered them with a few y'alls for good measure. When Biden showed up at Spiller Elementary School in Wytheville, Virginia, his motorcade zoomed by a phalanx of Romney supporters. No to a tyranny of debt, read one hostile sign. (SOUNDBITE OF CHEERING) ABRAMSON: Inside the school gym, Biden reminded supporters that his wife Jill is a teacher, and he spoke of the administration's support for increased education funding. And he turned again to Congressman Ryan, his new competitor for the number two job. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) ABRAMSON: The vice president blamed Republicans for creating the imagery of shackles, and said he was just turning it back on them. Biden's remarks do show that much of this campaign is focused on the language of fear. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) ABRAMSON: Biden said the foreclosure crisis was the cause of that fear, but his opponents have invoked similar images and blamed them on the current administration.

Mitt Romney's new running mate has authored some provocative policy proposals to cut budget deficits and overhaul Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. But Rep. Paul Ryan has also been an advocate for a different course for the central banking system of the United States, the Federal Reserve. For the past 35 years, the Fed has had a dual mandate from Congress: to set interest rates at levels that will both foster maximum employment and keep prices stable. Put another way, the Fed's goals are to get unemployment as low as possible while keeping inflation in check. Paul Ryan, however, wants to change that. He wants the Fed to stop trying to manage the unemployment rate and focus like a laser on just one goal: stable prices. At a hearing on Capitol Hill earlier this year, Ryan told Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke that he thought the central bank's focus on employment was a distraction from its effort to fight inflation. \"The result of this balanced approach is that higher-than-preferred inflation may be tolerated; not that it's desired, but that it will be tolerated,\" Ryan said. Quoting former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker, Ryan said that \"central bankers who are willing to tolerate a little more inflation usually wind up getting a whole lot more than they expected.\" Bernanke responded that focusing on jobs as well as stable prices is not a distraction for Fed policymakers. He said that the two sides of the mandate are generally complimentary. \"We agree that low, stable inflation is good for the economy and it's good for growth, it's good for employment,\" Bernanke said. \"And we think most of the time that there is a complimentary relationship between those two.\" At the heart of Ryan's argument is a concern about protecting the value of the dollar, which is eroded by inflation. In fact, Ryan has suggested that the country should return to sound money by pegging the value of the dollar to a basket of commodities, somewhat like the gold standard. In another exchange with Bernanke, Ryan argued that the Fed's response to the financial crisis \u2014 using extraordinary measures to inject more money into the economy to keep interest rates low \u2014 has created the risk of massive inflation and dollar devaluation, and set the stage for another crisis. \"[A] lot of us believe that the Federal Reserve was too loose for too long in the 2003 to 2005 period, and that is what in part led to the asset bubble ... and the problems that we have today,\" Ryan said. \"I know you don't agree with that, but because you don't agree with that, our fear is that you're just going to repeat these same mistakes again, but by orders of magnitude that we can't even comprehend right now,\" he said. Bernanke's response was that, so far, there's no evidence of accelerating inflation, and that the Fed has the tools and ability to remove the excess money from the economy once it begins growing again at a healthy rate. Ryan supports legislation that would give the Government Accountability Office the power to audit the Fed's interest rate decisions. Bernanke says that could politicize monetary policy. Ryan also believes the Fed's low interest rate policy has made it easier for Congress to avoid reducing massive federal budget deficits because borrowing costs are so low. \"That [is] not an excuse for the Federal Reserve to step in and try to bail us out,\" Ryan said. While Ryan has sparred with the Fed chairman during hearings, he has not called for Bernanke to be replaced. Mitt Romney, however, the man at the top of the ticket, says that if he's elected, he'll find a new Fed chairman.",

            "article_content": "President Obama continues his campaign bus trip across Iowa. He's traveling from west to east, drawing sharp contrasts with the Republican ticket. Obama warned some jobs could be in jeopardy if a wind power tax credit is allowed to expire, as Romney has proposed.  RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: This is MORNING EDITION from NPR News. I'm Renee Montagne. DAVID GREENE, HOST: And I'm David Greene, good morning. President Obama will rack up more miles today on his campaign bus trip in Iowa. He is traveling east, drawing sharp contrasts with his Republican challenger. GOP vice presidential hopeful Paul Ryan was also in Iowa yesterday. He spoke at the Iowa State Fair before heading west to Colorado. The two men are traveling in different directions, and not just on the map, as NPR's Scott Horsley reports. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: The sky was gray when President Obama touched down on the western edge of Iowa yesterday. Not long after he started speaking, though, at an outdoor rally in Council Bluffs, the clouds began to part. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: See, the sun is coming out. (SOUNDBITE OF CHEERING) HORSLEY: Ordinarily, that would be a good thing. But in this drought-ridden summer, many Iowans might have preferred a good downpour. Mr. Obama dropped by the McIntosh family farm in Missouri Valley, where the lack of rainfall is expected to cut this year's corn and soybean yields by at least a third. He announced plans for the federal government to buy up pork, lamb and chicken from struggling livestock producers. But the president said what farmers really need, in addition to rain, is for Congress to pass a farm bill. OBAMA: We've got to be there for them. Not just today, but tomorrow and every day until this drought passes because we are Americans. That's what we do. We take care of each other. And when tough times strike our neighbors, we give them a hand. (APPLAUSE) HORSLEY: The president's bus rolled east, past miles of cornfields with stalks baked brown by the heat. The Iowa landscape is also dotted now with windmills, enough to power one in five Iowa homes. Mr. Obama is celebrating that as a home-grown energy achievement. OBAMA: America generates more than twice as much electricity from wind than when I took office. And the wind... (APPLAUSE) HORSLEY: Wind energy is also a sizeable business in Iowa, employing six to seven thousand people here. Mr. Obama warns some of those jobs could be in jeopardy if a wind power tax credit is allowed to expire, as Republican White House hopeful Mitt Romney has proposed. The tax credit is one of a number of differences Mr. Obama is highlighting this week, with Romney and his new running mate, Paul Ryan. Many Iowans, like Laurie Riemer, are just beginning to get acquainted with Romney's vice presidential pick. LAURIE RIEMER: I know absolutely nothing about him. I've never even heard of him. HORSLEY: Mr. Obama is eager to fill in the blanks about Ryan. At a rally Riemer attended yesterday, the president called Ryan an ideological leader of Republicans in Congress. RIEMER: That doesn't enthuse me very much. The Republican administration before Obama's is what maybe got us into some of this economic distress in the first place. HORSLEY: Ryan, like Romney, has been an outspoken advocate for limited government and deregulation. But as chairman of the House Budget Committee, Ryan has had to be much more specific than Romney about the parts of government he'd cut. For Obama supporter Terry Krabbe, that's been an eye-opener. TERRY KRABBE: I've been reading the last couple days. And what I'm reading, I really don't like. I just think he's making a big mistake by trying to cut Pell Grants and Medicare. Pell Grants is a big plus for these kids. I can't believe they're even looking at it. HORSLEY: Ryan's track record in Congress makes him a hero to some and a target for others. The congressman faced some serious hecklers yesterday when he spoke at the Iowa State Fair. Mr. Obama got a friendlier welcome when he showed up at the fair last night. A vendor tried to tempt the president with cinnamon rolls, but Mr. Obama's focus was elsewhere. OBAMA: I'm saving my space, I think, for a pork chop on a stick. HORSLEY: He was not disappointed. After shaking hands with a long line of well-wishers, Mr. Obama met president-elect Greg Lear of the Iowa Pork Producers, who was waiting with a Styrofoam plate. GREG LEAR: Got a pair of Iowa chops. Don't come much better. OBAMA: Absolutely. Hey, everybody who's over 21, you've got to buy a beer. (LAUGHTER) HORSLEY: Mr. Obama ordered a round of drinks to wash down the pork chops, prompting some in the crowd to chant: four more beers. Even on a cool fair evening, though, the summer's drought was not forgotten. The Bud Light vendor gave Mr. Obama a T-shirt that read: Save Water, Drink Beer. Scott Horsley, NPR News, Des Moines.

            "article_content": "On Monday, GOP Rep. Paul Ryan made his first solo campaign trip since being named Mitt Romney's vice presidential running mate. Ryan went to the Iowa State where candidates are a common sight. Ryan drew a big crowd but it wasn't always friendly.  DAVID GREENE, HOST: This is MORNING EDITION, from NPR News. Good morning. I'm David Greene. RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: And I'm Renee Montagne. Congressman Paul Ryan has made his first solo campaign trip as part of the Romney-Ryan ticket. Ryan went to the Iowa State Fair yesterday, a place where the food is fried and often on a stick, where candidates are a common sight and where politicians are face-to-face with voters. Ryan drew a big crowd, though it wasn't always friendly one. NPR national political correspondent Don Gonyea was there. (APPLAUSE) DON GONYEA, BYLINE: Fairgoers cheered as Paul Ryan stepped out of his SUV on the grounds of the Iowa State Fair. The newly minted running mate was greeted by Governor Terry Branstad and a group of Republican officeholders. The entourage strolled down the Grand Concourse, as cameras and reporters jockeyed for a view. Ryan, a well-known fitness nut, did not provide the shot many had hoped for. He skipped the fried-foods. He also avoided reporter's questions with a line he used a few times as he walked. PAUL RYAN: We'll play \"Stump the Running Mate\" later. I'm just going to enjoy this fair right now. GONYEA: He walked and talked to voters, many of whom didn't know who he was. But Ryan's visit had been publicized in advance, and when he got to the tiny stage - known as the soapbox - that was the site of his speech, a huge crowd had gathered. Ryan is from neighboring Wisconsin, and he broke the ice with football. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) GONYEA: Right away, Ryan launched a critique of President Obama, showing his willingness to play the role of attack dog, a longtime tradition for vice-presidential candidates. Now, the president was also in Iowa yesterday, and would drop by the fair hours after Ryan had left. But back to Ryan's speech, just as he was attacking the president, a heckler in the crowd shouted: Are you going to cut Medicare? Other Hecklers began yelling more questions. Ryan stopped for just a moment. Then... (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) GONYEA: The heckling continued through much of the 12-minute speech. It couldn't have been a surprise to the campaign, given that on this same stage, during the Iowa State Fair one year ago, Mitt Romney himself was heckled, prompting him to say the now oft-quoted line: Corporations are people, my friend. Yesterday, Ryan supporters countered the hecklers with their own chant.    Ryan, meanwhile, plowed ahead, eventually finishing his attack on the president. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) GONYEA: Ryan did not talk about Medicare in his speech. He did ask voters - in a state that was so important to President Obama's success four years ago - to turn to the Republicans this year. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) GONYEA: Ultimately, it was a noisy and somewhat chaotic welcome to Congressman Paul Ryan on his first day campaigning on his own, on behalf of the new Romney-Ryan ticket.

            "article_content": "President Obama began a three day bus tour of Iowa on Monday. He held up the stalled out farm bill as an example of uncompromising Republican congressional leaders and an appropriate role for the federal government.  AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Audie Cornish. MELISSA BLOCK, HOST: And I'm Melissa Block. Get ready for fried food on a stick and political debate. We're going to Iowa. The state was back in the political spotlight today as both President Obama and Mitt Romney's new running mate made stops there. The president kicked off a three-day bus tour of Iowa, and Paul Ryan braved the state fair. Although Iowa only has six electoral votes, it is one of the most hotly contested battlegrounds this year. We'll hear more from Paul Ryan in a few minutes. First, here's NPR's Scott Horsley, who's traveling with the president. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: It's raining politicians in Iowa this week, but what the state really needs is some real rain. More than two-thirds of Iowa is suffering from extreme or exceptional drought. President Obama toured a parched farm in the Missouri River valley this afternoon at the start of a three-day campaign trip across the state. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Right now, folks here in Iowa and across the heartland, we're suffering from one of the worst droughts in 50 years. Farmers, ranchers depend on a good crop season to pay the bills and put a roof over their heads. And I know things are tough right now. HORSLEY: Mr. Obama announced the federal government will buy more than $150 million worth of pork, lamb and chicken to help ranchers who are struggling with high feed costs and trying to cull their herds. But the president said what's really needed, in addition to rain, is for Congress to pass a farm bill. Lawmakers failed to do that before their August recess. The bill's been held up by disagreements over crop subsidies and funding for food stamps. OBAMA: I am told that Governor Romney's new running mate, Paul Ryan, might be around Iowa the next few days. He is one of the leaders of Congress standing in the way. So if you happen to see Congressman Ryan, tell him how important this farm bill is to Iowa and our rural communities. HORSLEY: Mr. Obama calls Ryan one of the ideological leaders among House Republicans. And while that's a selling point for conservative voters, it could also be a liability. It gives Mr. Obama an opening to tie the Republican White House ticket to all the failings of Congress. OBAMA: We've got to put politics aside when it comes to doing the right thing for rural America and for Iowa. HORSLEY: Polls show Iowa is one of the most closely divided swing states this year. Mr. Obama is running neck and neck here with Republican Romney, despite winning Iowa by 10 points in 2008 and despite the state's relatively strong economy. Even with the drought, unemployment in Iowa is just 5.2 percent. Mr. Obama hopes to boost his standing in Iowa with this week's bus trip. The president still has plenty of supporters here, including Tom Brooks(ph), a truck driver from Honey Creek, Iowa. TOM BROOKS: He's tried to do everything he could to work with the Congress, and he's been blocked every turn. I mean, at least he is trying, and it seems like the other side doesn't try at all. HORSLEY: When it comes to Congressman Ryan and other Republican lawmakers, Brooks shares the president's frustration. BROOKS: Hold up the farm bill, the transportation bill, his jobs bills he's put through - I think he's been getting the raw end of the deal when it comes down to it. HORSLEY: Mr. Obama was already campaigning against Republicans in Congress, and those attacks will only grow sharper now that Ryan has joined the GOP ticket. As chairman of the House Budget Committee, Ryan crafted an economic plan that's similar to Romney's, but more specific in the cuts it would make. In addition to remaking Medicare and Medicaid, Congressman Ryan's budget would cut spending on transportation, research and education, almost all federal programs except the military. At the same time, Mr. Obama notes, Ryan and Romney have both proposed big tax cuts heavily weighted towards the wealthy. OBAMA: They have tried to sell us this trickle-down theory before. And guess what, every time it's been tried, it has not worked. HORSLEY: Mr. Obama will be making that case all across Iowa this week. This is the state that launched his presidential bid four years ago. He told supporters today they've come too far to go back now. Scott Horsley, NPR News, traveling with the president.

            "article_content": "Mitt Romney and his running mate Paul Ryan campaigned in different states on Monday. Ryan was in Iowa, where President Obama was also campaigning. Meanwhile, Romney was in the important battleground state of Florida. Some analysts believe that Ryan's budgets proposals \u2014 which make major changes to Medicare \u2014 could hurt the Romney/Ryan ticket in Florida, especially among older voters.  AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: This is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. I'm Audie Cornish. MELISSA BLOCK, HOST: And I'm Melissa Block. The two men on the Republican presidential ticket have flown off in different directions to campaign in two swing states. While Congressman Paul Ryan headed to Iowa, Mitt Romney flew to Florida. Polls there suggest President Obama has a slight edge and Democrats are feeling even more optimistic about winning Florida now that Ryan is on the Republican ticket. NPR's Ari Shapiro is travelling with Mitt Romney as he tries to beef up his Florida support. ARI SHAPIRO, BYLINE: It's a sticky, steamy morning on the Flagler College campus in St. Augustine. This part of Florida is less South Beach more Deep South. Spanish moss dangles from live oak tree branches and a rockabilly band is getting the crowd fired up. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SHAPIRO: The crowd here is not exactly college age. There's a lot of white hair in the audience. Retirees are one reason the Obama campaign is feeling more optimistic about Florida than they were a week ago. Democrats believe that Paul Ryan's proposals to change Medicare will drive older voters away from the Republican ticket. Under Ryan's plan, people under 55 would get money to buy health coverage on the private market. And retiree John Lochran(ph) thinks it's great. JOHN LOCHRAN: I hope those of us who have gray hair are not scared by the threats to Medicare and Social Security because if we don't do something about those two programs, they're going to dissolve anyway. SHAPIRO: That was the overwhelming sentiment among seniors here. Of course, these are all people who decided to come to a Romney rally, like Lila Taylor. LILA TAYLOR: They keep saying you have to sacrifice. Well, you know, if we have to sacrifice a little, we will. But I know that most of us have raised our children well enough that they would never let us go without drugs or whatever we needed. SHAPIRO: Data from the Pew Research Center show that seniors overwhelmingly rejected Ryan's voucher proposal when he first announced it. Seniors are more likely than others to oppose any change to entitlement programs according to Pew and Democrats see an opening there. But Judy Myes(ph) is a senior they cannot win over. She's decked out in all red, white and blue. JUDY MYES: They are trying their best to put fear. I understand Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan. They are not going to put me on the street. SHAPIRO: Everyone here said they're excited about Paul Ryan on the ticket, but several confessed that he was not their first choice. They wanted native son Marco Rubio, the senator who spoke first this morning. SENATOR MARCO RUBIO: We have had a great 72 hours. SHAPIRO: Less great for Rubio who was passed over for the VP spot. But today, he was stalwart. RUBIO: What we have learned over the last three days is that this election's not just going to be choice between two parties or two people, but it's literally a choice about our identity as a nation and as a people. SHAPIRO: The Romney campaign tried to lower expectations for this event. After a weekend of huge rallies with both Ryan and Romney, this is the presidential candidate's return to solo campaigning. But as his bus rolled through the historic Spanish architecture of this campus, the line of people waiting to get in still wrapped far around the block. MITT ROMNEY: Now, I understand there are even more people outside those barricades than inside here so the people way out there, thank you for coming today. (SOUNDBITE OF CHEERS) SHAPIRO: Romney knows that entitlements could be a weak spot for his ticket here in Florida, so he accused President Obama of trying to shrink the health care program for seniors. ROMNEY: The president's idea, for instance, for Medicare was to cut it by $700 billion. That's not the right answer. We want to make sure that we preserve and protect Medicare. SHAPIRO: The Congressional Budget Office says the president's health care law would save $700 billion over a decade through new revenues and spending cuts. The president's supporters argue that Paul Ryan's plan would cut Medicare more deeply without the expanded insurance coverage. And those are the battle lines in the fight for the senior vote this fall. Ari Shapiro, NPR News, travelling with the Romney campaign. Copyright \u00a9 2012 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Paul Ryan at the Iowa State Fair in Des Moines on Monday. With Rep. Paul Ryan officially in the mix as Mitt Romney's vice presidential pick, the 2012 race for the White House was fully engaged Monday, as all four members of the two major-party presidential tickets campaigned in swing states. Both President Obama and Ryan were in Iowa, while Romney, the all-but-official Republican nominee, campaigned in Florida. Meanwhile, Vice President Biden was in North Carolina, hitting a state the Republican ticket visited over the weekend. Obama began a three-day bus tour through Iowa with a stop in Council Bluffs. The president used the opportunity to immediately go after Ryan on an issue with special resonance in a major agricultural state: the failure of the Republicans, who control the House, to bring a Senate-passed farm bill to a floor vote. That legislation contained a relief measure to help drought-afflicted farmers like those in the Midwest. Ryan, an intellectual leader of the House Republicans and Budget Committee chairman, was an inviting target for Obama. OBAMA: \"Unfortunately right now, too many members of Congress are blocking the farm bill from becoming law. (Crowd boos.) \"I am told that Gov. Romney's new running mate, Paul Ryan, might be around Iowa the next few days. He is \u2014 (boos) \u2014 one of the leaders of Congress standing in the way. \"So if you happen to see Congressman Ryan, tell him how important this farm bill is to Iowa and our rural communities. (Applause.) We've got to put politics aside when it comes to doing the right thing for rural America and for Iowa.\" (Cheers, applause.) House Republicans decided against bringing the bill to the floor in part because of divisions in their ranks. Agricultural subsidies in the bill are opposed by some Republican legislators, who view them as corporate welfare at odds with their free-market principles. Appearing at the Iowa State Fair in Des Moines, Ryan had his own question for Iowans to ask Obama: REP. RYAN: \"My guess is the reason President Obama isn't making it here from Council Bluffs \u2014 because he only knows left turns. (Crowd cheers, applause.) \"You know \u2014 but as you see the president come through on his bus tour, you might ask him the same question that I'm getting asked from people all around America, and that is where are the jobs, Mr. President?\" (Cheers, applause.) Ryan stopped to deliver brief remarks at The Des Moines Register's soapbox, a stage used by visiting politicians during election season to deliver their messages to Iowans. It was at the same location last year that Romney uttered the famous line \"Corporations are people, my friend,\" in response to hecklers. Ryan was heckled, too. But he didn't deliver a response that appeared, at first blush, to be gold for the opposition, as Romney did last summer. RYAN: \"We're used to this in Wisconsin \u2014 oh yeah.\" Ryan alluded to the superheated political climate in the Badger State since Republican Gov. Scott Walker and his allies in the state legislature decided to take on the public employee unions. Romney's selection of Ryan, a favorite with the conservative base, has made it easier for the president to make an argument he's tried all along: that the general election is a choice between two starkly different visions of the nation's future. Obama used one of his favorite words, \"choice,\" at least eight times: OBAMA: \"I'm going to spend the next three days driving all across this state, just like I did in 2007, from \u2014 from Council Bluffs to the Quad Cities, because once more you face a choice in November. And that choice could not be bigger. \"It is not just a choice between two candidates or two political parties. More than any other election in recent memory, this is a choice between two fundamentally different visions of this country and the path that we have to take. And the direction that you choose when you walk into that voting booth in November is going to have an impact not just on your lives but on your children's lives, your grandchildren's lives for decades to come. (Cheers, applause.) This one counts.\" Romney's campaign had previously been largely based on the notion that the election amounted to a referendum on the president's performance. Based on the language both he and Ryan used at campaign appearances over the weekend and again on Monday, the Republicans seemed to have decided to accept Obama's premise that the election is a choice \u2014 but to hang onto the earlier strategy that it is a referendum, too, in something of a one-two punch. For instance, Ryan said Monday at the Iowa State Fair: \"And so what you will see from us is this: We owe you a choice. You are our fellow citizens, and what we want to do is give you the choice so you can decide what kind of country you want to have. What kind of people do you want us to be?\" Meanwhile, campaigning in St. Augustine, Fla., Romney told an audience the president deserved failing grades and only one term for his performance. \"He said that he would be able to measure progress and measure success by a whole series of his own standards. Number one was being able to create jobs. But I hope he understands that he hasn't done that: 23 million Americans out of work or stopped looking for work and can't find the jobs they need to put food on the table for their families. \"It's unacceptable. It's a moral failure for a nation as successful as ours not to have created these jobs. Mr. President, by your own measure, you failed to deliver the jobs Americans need. (Cheers, applause.)\" Campaigning in Florida, long a warm-weather haven for retirees, Romney renewed a charge \u2014 by now repeatedly discredited by journalistic fact-checkers \u2014 that Obama cut hundreds of billions of dollars from the Medicare program as part of the Affordable Care Act. ROMNEY: \"The president's idea, for instance, for Medicare was to cut it by $700 billion. That's not the right answer. We want to make sure that we preserve and protect Medicare.\" (Republicans initially charged Obama with cutting $500 billion from Medicare. NPR's Julie Rovner explained in a Q&A earlier this year that hospitals and other health care providers volunteered to take the cuts in payments with the expectation they would come out whole since more patients would be insured.) Biden, for his part, was in Durham, N.C., where he also zeroed in on the differences between the tickets. An excerpt from Politico of Biden's appearance at a rally: \"Now that Gov. Romney has selected his running mate, those ... differences are even more stark,\" Biden told 900 people here. \"The reason I say that, Congressman Ryan has given definition to the vague commitments that Romney's been making.\" \"... And ladies and gentlemen, we know, we know for certain, what I've been saying for a long time, there is no distinction, let's get this straight, there is no distinction between what the Republican Congress has been proposing the last two years, actually the last four years, and what Gov. Romney wants to do.\"",

            "article_content": "GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney and running mate Paul Ryan stopped off in Ryan's home state of Wisconsin Sunday. Ryan has represented Wisconsin's 1st Congressional District for 14 years. In that time, he's gained national attention for proposing sweeping changes to the way government works while also watching out for his constituents.  DAVID GREENE, HOST: Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan go their separate ways on the campaign trail today: Romney to Florida, and as we mentioned, Ryan will be in Iowa. Now, yesterday, the Republican running mates stopped off in Ryan's home state of Wisconsin. Ryan has represented that state's first district for 14 years, and in that time, he's gained national attention for proposing sweeping changes in the way government works. He's also watched out for his constituents. Here's NPR's Brian Naylor. BRIAN NAYLOR, BYLINE: When Paul Ryan first campaigned for Congress, he advocated themes much like the ones he does now. Here he is at the opening of his Racine campaign office in 1998. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) NAYLOR: Ryan made his first big splash in Washington proposing a plan that would allow Social Security recipients to invest some of their benefits in the stock market. Though it was championed by the Bush administration, it collapsed in the face of united opposition from Democrats. He followed that with what he called the Path to Prosperity, a budget plan that included another sweeping idea: transforming Medicare from a guaranteed benefit to a voucher program. After it was adopted as part of the House Republican budget last year, President Obama harshly denounced it in a speech, as Ryan looked on from the front rows. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) NAYLOR: There is likely to be a lot more rhetoric like that from the Obama campaign now that Ryan is on the GOP ticket. And Ryan and his proposals are clearly a risk for Republicans. In a special election last year in Upstate New York, now-Democratic Congresswoman Kathy Hochul defeated her GOP opponent with the help of ads like this one. (SOUNDBITE OF POLITICAL ADVERTISEMENT) NAYLOR: Ryan himself hasn't escaped the fallout from his vision of major changes to entitlement programs. He faced a group of angry constituents at this town meeting in Kenosha in 2009. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) NAYLOR: Ryan has also run the risk of offending Tea Party activists. He voted for the TARP program in 2008 to rescue the nation's banks. And he backed the bailout of the auto industry, which has a major presence in his district. Ryan shows no signs of backing away from his ideas, and, in fact, seems to enjoy the fight. Before he ran for Congress, one of his first jobs in Washington was writing speeches for Jack Kemp, the former congressman who co-founded the conservative think tank Empower America. Ryan has said he admired Kemp's inclusive conservatism and happy warrior spirit. He's also a fan of novelist Ayn Rand. He told enraptured conservatives at his year's CPAC Conference in Washington that the times call for bold solutions. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) Copyright \u00a9 2012 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "President Obama says he wants this campaign to be about ideas and differing outlooks for the future. The selection of Rep. Paul Ryan as Mitt Romney's running mate offers the chance for just such a fight. Ryan is the author of a conservative and controversial budget.  DAVID GREENE, HOST: It's MORNING EDITION, from NPR News. Good morning. I'm David Greene. RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: And I'm Renee Montagne. When President Obama begins a bus tour through Iowa today, he'll be campaigning not only against the policies of Mitt Romney, but also of Paul Ryan, Romney's new running mate. Paul Ryan will also be in Iowa today, though chances are he won't come face to face with the president. But as NPR's Scott Horsley reports, their economic platforms will be going head to head. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: President Obama has effectively been campaigning against Paul Ryan and the other Republicans in Congress for the last two years. That will only ratchet up now that the Wisconsin lawmaker is officially on the GOP ticket. At a campaign fundraiser in Chicago yesterday, Mr. Obama congratulated Ryan and welcomed him to White House race. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) HORSLEY: That disagreement goes back a long way, though it wasn't always so heated.  At a GOP House retreat in 2010, Mr. Obama said Ryan's proposal to turn Medicare into a voucher program was an idea that warranted serious discussion. Then, as now, he warned the plan might just shift health care costs onto the backs of seniors. But he also lamented a slash-and-burn political culture in which each party tries to win votes by scaring seniors, for example, about the other side's proposals. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) HORSLEY: Fifteen months later, in a speech at George Washington University, Mr. Obama took the gloves off. By that time, Republicans had taken control of the House and crafted a budget that included Ryan's Medicare plan, as well as deep cuts in taxes and federal spending. Supporters called the Ryan budget serious and courageous. But with Ryan sitting in the audience, the president insisted it was neither. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) HORSLEY: Yesterday, a spokesman tried to distance Romney from the Ryan budget, stressing that economic policy will be set by the man at the top of the ticket, not his running mate. Mr. Obama drew no such distinction in attacking what he called the Republicans' top-down economics. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) HORSLEY: Democrats say by choosing one of the ideological leaders among House Republicans as his running mate, Romney has sharpened the battle lines in the November election. (SOUNDBITE OF CNN BROADCAST) HORSLEY: That's Maryland Congressman Chris Van Hollen on CNN. As the ranking Democrat on the House Budget Committee, Van Hollen had an up-close look at Ryan's spending plan, which would not only change Medicare and Medicaid, but would also cut funding for education, research and transportation. (SOUNDBITE OF CNN BROADCAST) HORSLEY: Even with those spending cuts, Ryan's budget would not be balanced for decades, because it doesn't include any new tax revenue. Ryan also voted against the tax increases proposed by the Simpson-Bowles Deficit Commission, which he was a member of. On NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" the Obama campaign's political advisor, David Axelrod, challenged Ryan's reputation as a deficit hawk. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"MEET THE PRESS\") HORSLEY: Mr. Obama seems to have set aside any reservations about slash-and-burn politics. Beneath the smoke and scorched earth, though, there's now a serious debate underway about the proper size and scope of the federal government. Scott Horsley, NPR News. Copyright \u00a9 2012 NPR.

            "article_content": "Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and his running mate, Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., address supporters in Mooresville, N.C., on Sunday. Some pundits predict Ryan's selection will damage Romney's chances of winning Florida.\n                \n                    \n                    Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and his running mate, Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., address supporters in Mooresville, N.C., on Sunday. Some pundits predict Ryan's selection will damage Romney's chances of winning Florida. Here's the above-the-fold headline on Sunday's Miami Herald: \"Ryan could hurt Romney in Florida.\" Pundits are already predicting that Mitt Romney's vice presidential pick, Rep. Paul Ryan, will damage, if not doom, Romney's chances of winning the largest swing state. (Romney was scheduled to take his bus tour to Florida on Monday, with Ryan coming later in the week for a Tampa fundraiser.) First, we should acknowledge the research showing a VP pick has little effect on the outcome of a presidential race. But the race is too close to call in Florida, and even small decisions could mean the difference between victory and defeat in the state. So, will Ryan help or hurt Romney? The answer is different for Florida's different GOP constituencies. 1. Cuban-Americans: During the lead-up to Florida's Republican primary, Romney made a speech in south Florida criticizing President Obama's Cuba policy \u2014 especially lifting some travel restrictions and allowing more cultural exchanges. But Ryan has voted more than once against the Cuban embargo. He also told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel in 2008, \"If we're going to have free trade with China, why not Cuba?\" Since then, his position reportedly has changed, and he now supports the embargo. But according to Miami Herald reporter Marc Caputo, south Florida's Cuban GOP community is not pleased. Then again, the Cuban community in Florida is not monolithic. Younger Cuban-Americans are more likely to favor increased ties with Cuba. It doesn't help that Romney passed over another rising GOP star and Tea Party favorite who just happens to be Cuban-American: Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. New York Times election guru Nate Silver says Rubio would have added 2.3 percent to Romney's margin in Florida \u2014 perhaps just enough to overcome Obama's slight lead in the polls. 2. Seniors: There are a lot of senior citizens in Florida, and they vote in big numbers. Polls show Florida seniors favoring Romney. So, how will the retiree and soon-to-be retiree set react to Ryan, the 42-year-old representative from Wisconsin? Remember, Ryan was at the forefront of President George W. Bush's failed plan on Social Security \u2014 which would have allowed participants to invest in the stock market. Not to mention Ryan's more recent plan for Medicare \u2014 which, depending on your politics, either saves the program through competition, or turns it into a voucher system to \"push grandma off a cliff.\" A CNN poll last summer showed that a majority of voters oppose the Ryan proposal \u2014 and seniors as a group were even more against it. That has led some pundits to say Romney just handed Florida to Obama. But there's at least one example that indicates otherwise: Rubio. In 2010, Rubio was in a tough race against then-Gov. Charlie Crist for the U.S. Senate. Crist made a big issue of Rubio's support for making changes to Social Security and Medicare. But Rubio won that race by a huge margin, including among seniors. One more thing \u2014 Romney is not likely to cede the Medicare issue to Obama. He already has been criticizing Obama on what he calls $700 billion in Medicare reductions under the Affordable Care Act. He promised to protect Medicare again in his speech introducing Ryan. It all suggests Social Security and Medicare reform are no longer the third rail of politics in Florida \u2014 or perhaps the rail is losing its shock value.

Paul Ryan of Wisconsin greet supporters during a homecoming campaign rally Sunday in Waukesha, Wis.\n                \n                    \n                    Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney (right) and running mate Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin greet supporters during a homecoming campaign rally Sunday in Waukesha, Wis. It was almost as if everyone dared Mitt Romney to make a bold move. He couldn't possibly pick Ohio Sen. Rob Portman or former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty as his running mate, could he? Too boring, the critics said! Too white bread! Too uninspiring! The cover of Newsweek talked about Romney's \"wimp factor.\" Comedy Central's Stephen Colbert \u2014 not that he played a leading role here \u2014 described a Romney-Portman ticket as \"like the bland leading the bland.\" And it wasn't only about the V.P. choice. National Review columnist Mark Steyn, under the header \"Milquetoast Mitt,\" wrote that he supports Romney and he's \"not rattled by a bad week's polls. But I am bothered that Romney's insipid message does not rise to the challenge this nation faces. Maybe the milquetoast pantywaist candy-assed soft-focus 'Believe in America' shtick will prove sufficient under a relentless barrage of nakedly thuggish attack ads designed to Barry Goldwater the guy. But John Podhoretz, editor of Commentary, thinks not: 'This is a race he should be able to win,' he wrote, 'so if he loses, it won't be because Obama won it. It will be because he lost it.'\" The Weekly Standard's Bill Kristol and Stephen Hayes, less pessimistic, felt that what was needed was a bold selection of a running mate, one that would turn things around, saying that such a move \"would suggest that Romney knows this is a big moment, and that he's willing to run a big campaign. And at a time when the country so desperately needs real leadership, Romney would make clear that he's ready to provide it by picking either Ryan or [Florida Sen. Marco] Rubio.\" A recent post on RedState.com offered this advice: \"Now is not the time to be timid. Now is not the time to play it safe. Be Bold, Governor Romney.\" And Kimberly Atkins, writing in the Boston Herald, said, \"A vice presidential nominee rarely sways an undecided voter. But people judge candidates by the company they keep, and Mitt can't afford to share the ticket with another stiff, boring guy. He needs someone who can get a roar from a crowd, who helps him look less overly starched and out of touch.\" So Romney, the cautious and risk-averse Romney, made the bold move, selecting Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin as his running mate. It's a major gamble. Ryan, the House Budget Committee chair, is not another stiff, boring guy. He is among a group of activist House Republicans who want to drastically shake up the system and tell America it is heading towards a fiscal disaster unless it drastically cuts federal spending. The risk of naming Ryan, and his revolutionary plan to completely restructure Medicare, has always been obvious. Proponents argue that it is the only plan out there that could save the program as we know it. Opponents say that by privatizing Medicare the Ryan plan will kill it. But not all the opposition resides in the White House. There are doubters in the GOP as well, most memorably addressed \u2014 though since retracted \u2014 by Newt Gingrich, who called Ryan's controversial plan \"right-wing social engineering\" in 2011. And while only ten Republicans voted against Ryan's plan when it came before the House, some GOP candidates in senior-heavy states, like Florida and Pennsylvania, could become extra vulnerable if the Democrats define Ryan's plan as a disaster for the elderly, which they are sure to do. For its part, Romney's campaign will argue that Democrats would have tied Romney to Ryan no matter who the running mate was going to be, so why not make the election a stark choice between two philosophies? It's a choice the White House wants to make as well. Perhaps, if polls were more encouraging, Romney might not have gone with a risky pick. But the numbers in the key swing states were looking more and more positive for President Obama. Selecting Ryan certainly shakes up the race, though how long that lasts is unknown at this point. One thing that's clear is the Wisconsin congressman, 42 years of age, excites the conservative base of the party in a way Romney never could. But many on the right who found 1996 nominee Bob Dole and 2008 nominee John McCain lacking were similarly ecstatic once they named Jack Kemp and Sarah Palin as their respective running mates, two choices that wowed conservatives ... but who, ultimately, were insignificant to the election results. The choice of Paul Ryan may very well prove significant to what happens in November. But the Republican argument \u2014 that the election is all about Obama \u2014 may be in jeopardy. Ryan's song. Ryan's resume included stints as a former staffer for ex-Sen. Bob Kasten (R-Wis.), a top aide to Kansas Republican Sam Brownback, and a protege of Jack Kemp while at Empower America when he decided to run for Congress from southeast Wisconsin (Racine, Kenosha) in 1998. It was the seat being vacated by Senate candidate Mark Neumann, a seat that had been closely contested between the two parties the three previous elections (although long held by Democrat Les Aspin before that). But Ryan easily won it, with 57 percent of the vote, and he hasn't fallen below 62 percent in his six re-election contests. President Bush won the district with 53 percent in 2004, but Barack Obama got 51 percent four years later. House members for V.P. Here are the last three times incumbent members of the House were named as presidential running mates: 1984: Geraldine Ferraro (NY) \u2014 ticket led by Walter Mondale (D) lost. 1964: William Miller (NY) \u2014 ticket led by Barry Goldwater (R) lost. 1932: John Nance Garner (TX) \u2014 ticket led by Franklin Roosevelt (D) won. Name the Veep contest. In my April 9 column, I asked for your prediction as to whom Romney would choose as his running mate. Several picked Ryan. But Brian Rich of Boise, Idaho was the first. At the time, he wrote, \"Romney and Ryan are equally obnoxiously wonky and really deserve each other.\" Well, whatever. Brian wins something, not sure what yet. Others who predicted Ryan include Becky Howard of Syracuse, N.Y., whose prediction came just two hours after Brian's; Mitchell Scott of De Pere, Wis.; Linda Markwardt; David Kaye of Milwaukee, Wis., who wrote, \"While I don't personally care for the guy (I am a Milwaukee Democrat after all), I think his youth, his conservative credentials, and the fact that he and Romney get along so well make him Romney's obvious choice\"; Laurie Zwick of Howell, Mich.; Jim Smith of Flippin, Ark.; Martin Long of Arlington, Mass., who wrote, \"Romney's strategy is 100% focused around the economy. He's not only doubling down on the economy, he's going all-in. He's already associated himself publicly with Ryan's budget, so any downside, he's already going to get. Ryan is smart, and number-centric (just like Romney). Moreover, after watching them in Wisconsin, they clearly get along\"; Stephen Gilmore of Charlotte, N.C., who noted that Ryan \"is an alumnus of my alma mater, Miami University (the one in Ohio)\"; Stella Neves Elbaum of Mystic, Conn.; and Danny Davis of Danville, Va. And while seven people picked Ryan before he did, Martin Long was certainly the most persistent. Back in June he wrote, \"It's going to be Paul Ryan. I can't wait to say 'I told you so'!!!\" It gets worse. Martin also happened to have the correct trivia answer last Wednesday on Talk of the Nation's Political Junkie segment. He said on the air, \"And I want to remind Ken: I have been exchanging e-mails with him for weeks that Paul Ryan is going to be the VP choice.\" Well, he \u2014 and everybody listed above \u2014 was right. I \u2014 as usual \u2014 was wrong. This week. Primaries on Tuesday in Connecticut, Florida, Minnesota and Wisconsin.

Wisconsin: The retirement of four term Sen. Herb Kohl (D) has given Republicans an opportunity to pick up a seat. But the ostensible frontrunner, former Gov. Tommy Thompson, is being battered by conservative opposition, who argue he is too willing to compromise with Democrats and too out of touch to represent the new GOP. Thompson, 70, has been out of office since 2001, when he left Madison after four terms to join the Bush Cabinet as health and human services secretary. Former Rep. Mark Neumann is hoping support from the Tea Party Express and Club for Growth will carry him to victory, but he also has to contend with the personal fortune of another candidate, businessman Eric Hovde, who has spent some $4 million of his own money on his bid. A fourth Republican, Assembly Speaker Jeff Fitzgerald, is thought to be well behind. Neumann gave up a House seat, which he held for two terms, to take on then-Sen. Russ Feingold (D) in 1998, a race he lost narrowly. He also sought the GOP gubernatorial nomination in 2010, losing in a landslide to Scott Walker. The Democratic Senate nominee will be Rep. Tammy Baldwin, a solid liberal. The last Republican to hold this seat was the infamous Joe McCarthy, who died in office in 1957. And as for Rep. Paul Ryan's (R) House seat in the 1st District, state law allows him to run for both vice president and re-election to Congress, and he is expected to do so. Connecticut: Sen. Joe Lieberman, the Democrat-turned-Independent, is retiring after four terms. Rep. Chris Murphy, a three-term congressman from the western part of the state, is the Democrats' endorsed candidate and the frontrunner for the nomination against former former Secretary of the State Susan Bysiewicz. On the Republican side, Linda McMahon seems to have too much money to be in jeopardy to lose to former Rep. Chris Shays for the nomination. McMahon, the former World Wrestling Entertainment CEO, was the GOP nominee for the Senate two years ago, losing in a landslide to Democrat Richard Blumenthal despite spending $50 million of her own money. While some think Shays, a moderate who has shown appeal to Democrats and independents, might be a stronger general election candidate, McMahon shows no sign of losing the primary. Florida: Rep. Connie Mack IV, son and namesake of the former senator, is a clear favorite over ex-Rep. Dave Weldon for the Republican nomination. Sen. Bill Nelson (D) is seeking a third term. In the House, redistricting has forced two Republican incumbents --veteran John Mica and freshman Sandy Adams \u2014 to run against each other in a bitter contest. In a sense, this is a microcosm of the internal conflict that the GOP is facing. Mica, chairman of the House Transportation Committee, has long worked closely with Democrats, while Adams, backed by elements of the Tea Party, has criticized Mica as a big spender. Mica had the option of running in an adjacent district, where more of his constituents lived, but he chose to run in the same CD as Adams. Minnesota: Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D) is expected to breeze to renomination for a second term. The Republican frontrunner is thought to be state Rep. Kurt Bills, who benefited from an apparent takeover of the state GOP by Ron Paul supporters. His closest challenger appears to be businessman and veteran David Carlson, who has lost previous bids for the House and Senate. In the 8th CD, where freshman GOP Rep. Chip Cravaack is seeking re-election, much attention has been on the Democratic primary, where one of the candidates is Rick Nolan, who was elected to Congress in 1974 and served three terms before deciding against running again in 1980. If elected, he would become a freshman at age 69. Political Updates. I post periodic political updates during the week on Twitter. You can follow me at @kenrudin.

But that may have been the only time she mentioned the word \"life\" all night. Molinari supports abortion rights, and her selection as keynoter was made to send a signal to moderates that they are still welcome in the GOP. She was preceded on the stage by N.J. Gov. Christine Todd Whitman and followed by Texas Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, two more pro-choice Republicans. Also on the sked: House Speaker Newt Gingrich, Rep. J.C. Watts of Oklahoma and House Budget Committee chair John Kasich of Ohio. After Molinari concluded the speeches, Jack Kemp \u2014 Bob Dole's choice for VP \u2014 threw little footballs into the crowd (Aug. 13, 1996). Got a question? Ask Ken Rudin: politicaljunkie@npr.org",

            "article_content": "We're keeping our ear on the Sunday talk shows this morning. Obviously the topic of the day is Rep. Paul Ryan, whom the Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney has chosen as his running mate. Both parties have already traded hard shots, but it appears there is agreement that the addition of Ryan, who has led the GOP on matters of budget, focuses this presidential election. It is now focused on a broader narrative about the size and role of government. We'll update this post with the highlights as the morning progresses: -- On Meet The Press, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker says that adding Ryan to the ticket gives the American people what they want: A politician who speaks hard truths and is willing to make tough decisions despite political consequence. Walker adds that with Ryan, Wisconsin all of a sudden becomes competitive for Republicans. -- David Axelrod, one of Obama's senior strategists, was also on Meet The Press. He did not hold back. His message was that with Ryan, the Republicans are choosing a set of policy that gives the rich massive tax cuts, while slashing programs that benefit the poor and middle class. The Romney/Ryan economic plan, said Axelrod, \"is a prescription for economic catastrophe.\" -- Bill Bennett, the conservative radio show host and former education secretary, makes a salient point on Meet The Press: The one thing that people aren't talking about is Ryan's ability to \"argue and persuade.\" He thinks that will play a big role during this election. -- On This Week, Former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean said the problem with the Ryan pick is that he is \"well outside the mainstream\" of American politics. Specifically, he said, Ryan's budget ideas would mean \"radical change\" and has all of a sudden shifted the narrative in the election from a \"referendum on Barack Obama to a referendum on Republican economic policy.\" -- Political analyst and Morning Edition contributor Cokie Roberts added that this choice was made to shore up the base. \"People have their mind made up their minds\" in this election. This choice is to make sure that the conservative base comes out to vote. -- Newt Gingrich, who famously called the Ryan budget \"right-wing social engineering\" was on Face the Nation. He walked away from those comments saying Ryan was an \"extraordinarily exciting choice.\" He fought back against the Congressional Budget Office, which has said that the Ryan budget doesn't cut the deficit for decades. He called the independent agency's conclusions \"factually false.\"",

            "article_content": "In Norfolk, Va., Saturday, Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney announced that his running mate is Paul Ryan, a Republican congressman from Wisconsin. The 42-year-old is chairman of the House Budget Committee.  GUY RAZ, HOST: It's WEEKENDS on ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. I'm Guy Raz. MITT ROMNEY: It's an honor to announce my running mate and the next vice president of the United States, Paul Ryan. (SOUNDBITE OF CHEERING) RAZ: That's Mitt Romney, ending weeks of feverish speculation earlier today. Wisconsin Congressman Paul Ryan, the chairman of the House Budget Committee, has joined the GOP presidential ticket. The two men launched a multiday, multistate bus tour that kicked off in Norfolk, Virginia, this morning where Paul Ryan spoke to energized crowds. PAUL RYAN: Our rights come from nature and God, not from governments. (SOUNDBITE OF CHEERING) RYAN: That's right. That's who we are. That's how we built this country. That's who we are. UNIDENTIFIED GROUP: USA, USA, USA, USA... RYAN: That's what made us great. UNIDENTIFIED GROUP: ...USA, USA... RYAN: That's our founding. RAZ: Romney's choice is being heralded as a bold one. Paul Ryan is controversial, not least for his plan to privatize Medicare and Social Security. In a few moments, we'll head to the campaign trail, and later, how the philosopher Ayn Rand came to inspire Paul Ryan's entry into politics. But first, a question: Who is Paul Ryan? Here's NPR's Brian Naylor. BRIAN NAYLOR, BYLINE: Paul Ryan remembers his first job in Washington. It came after college. He attended Miami University in Ohio, and he was thinking of taking some time off to do some skiing. Ryan told CNN last year his mother tried to dissuade him. RYAN: And my mom was worried that if I, after college, went to go do some skiing that it would take two years to turn into five, 10, whatever years. And so I was offered a job as an economics policy researcher for my home state Senator Bob Kasten at the time, and she really gave me a big nudge to take that job because she was worried I'd become a ski bum. And that's when I got involved into economics and politics. NAYLOR: Ryan was born and grew up and still lives in Janesville, Wisconsin, southwest of Milwaukee. He's Catholic. His father, a lawyer, died when Paul was 16. He grew up fast, he told The New Yorker. He took school seriously, was elected president of the junior class and won the dubious distinction as biggest brown-noser in his senior year. Ryan's wife, Janna, is a tax attorney and cousin of Democratic Congressman Dan Boren of Oklahoma. The Ryans have three school-age children. Like many Republicans, he's pointed to his family as reason for his concerns about the debt and the size of government. Here's Ryan delivering the Republican response to President Obama's State of the Union address in 2011. RYAN: On this current path, when my three children, who are now 6, 7 and 8 years old, are raising their own children, the federal government will double in size and so will the taxes they pay. NAYLOR: In 1998, Ryan ran for the House seat vacated when Republican Mark Neumann ran for the Senate. By all accounts a determined campaigner, Ryan won surprisingly easily and joined the House at age 28. As a congressman elect, Ryan told C-SPAN he couldn't wait to get back to Wisconsin. RYAN: I'm an avid hunter. I come from Wisconsin. I'm actually - opening day of deer season is Saturday so I'm flying back Friday so I can join my family hunting for deer. NAYLOR: Ryan quickly rose up the GOP ranks on the strength of his ideas. Among them, a plan to partially privatize Social Security that was adopted by the Bush administration but which died in the face of united opposition from Democrats. Still, by proposing dramatic changes to a program long dubbed the third rail of American politics, Ryan showed his determination to change Americans' relationship to the federal government. It's the kind of change he continues to push as he stated in his speech earlier this year to the conservative political action conference CPAC. RYAN: Boldness and clarity offer the greatest opportunity to create a winning coalition. We'll not only win the next election; we have a unique opportunity to sweep and remake the political landscape. NAYLOR: That willingness to be bold contrasts with and may compliment Mitt Romney's more cautious approach to campaigning and governing. It's evident in the budget the House passed this year that Ryan drafted and which would eventually replace Medicare with a voucher-like program. That idea will now become a centerpiece of the presidential campaign and puts Paul Ryan squarely in the middle of a major fight over the future of the nation's fiscal and social policy.

GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney's choice of Rep. Paul Ryan as his running mate seems to be uniting both Republicans and Democrats. The GOP is embracing the young, wonky addition to the ticket, while the left seems happy to be taking him on. Here's a quick look at the pluses and minuses of the decision, from the point of view of the man at the top of the ticket. PROS: The Right Is Thrilled: Romney's decision follows open campaigning for Ryan from conservative institutions like The Wall Street Journal's editorial page. The conservative National Review editors reacted Saturday: \"Governor Romney has made an inspired choice. Paul Ryan will make an excellent running mate and, if elected, vice president.\" Romney Gets A Chance To Rise Above Small-Ball: As The Wall Street Journal put it in its editorial: \"Mr. Obama and the Democrats want to make this a small election over small things \u2014 Mitt's taxes, his wealth, Bain Capital. As the last two months have shown, Mr. Romney will lose that kind of election.\" By picking Ryan, who is known for his fiscal conservatism and his commitment to overhauling big federal programs like Medicare and Social Security, \"Romney will move more boldly than most observers expected to try to shift the debate off his personal financial past and on to America's economic future,\" writes James Rainey in the Los Angeles Times. Romney May Score Points In Wisconsin: The swing state went solidly for President Obama four years ago and hasn't voted for a Republican presidential contender since the 1980s. But \"Ryan's blue-collar Wisconsin background and personal popularity \u2014 he's won his last six races with no less than 63% of the vote \u2014 could give Romney a boost there,\" says USA Today's David Colton. CONS: It's Red Meat For Democrats: The left is going to sink its teeth into Ryan's budget plan and never let go. Obama and other Democrats have already been campaigning against it. In April, Obama said it was \"so far to the right that it makes the Contract With America look like the New Deal.\" \"There was no one on Romney's short list of contenders [Democrats] wanted to run against more than the chairman of the House Budget Committee,\" Dan Balz writes in The Washington Post. \"Romney has now assumed ownership of Ryan's budgetary plan and its provisions for reining in the cost of entitlement programs. Democrats will attack it and its author as vigorously as they have tried to savage Romney's business background and personal finances.\" And the attacks on Ryan's plan \u2014 which, since it would eventually involve changes to Medicare, will be particularly targeted toward seniors \u2014 could breathe new life into Obama's campaign in the key swing state of Florida. Experience Gap: Like Romney, Ryan lacks much foreign policy experience. And unlike Romney, he doesn't have a business or executive background. \"Besides summer jobs working at McDonald's or at his family's construction company, or waiting tables as a young Washington staffer, Ryan has none of the business-world experience Romney frequently touts as essential for governing,\" Ryan Lizza writes in The New Yorker. PRO Or CON? It Could Take The Focus Off President Obama's Record: In many quarters, Romney's bold pick is being viewed as an acknowledgement that trying to keep the campaign solely focused on President Obama's handling of the economy wasn't working out. But, as John Harris and Mike Allen write in Politico, \"It is hard to overstate the risks Romney is taking in making a choice that virtually guarantees a far-reaching debate about the broader role of government and the entitlement state. Simply put, it is a debate Republicans have almost never won when they've put it directly before voters in the past.\"",

Paul Ryan of Wisconsin as his vice presidential running mate Saturday in Norfolk, Va. Some of those who know Mitt Romney best or have studied his political and business careers say the Republican presidential candidate tends toward caution and deep analysis in making decisions. That helps explain why his choice of Rep. Paul Ryan surprised more than a few: Among the candidates reportedly on Romney's short list, Ryan was widely perceived as one of the less-safe choices. Ryan, the congressman from Wisconsin who chairs the House Budget Committee, has been a lightning rod for Democrats because of his proposed budgets, which would transform Medicare into a voucher program. Other names, like those of Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio or former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty, were seen as much safer. But Romney decided to take what at first blush appeared the riskier path, making it seem that he was playing against type. Allan Lichtman, an American University history professor and expert on the presidency, told It's All Politics in an interview: \"The conventional wisdom has been that Romney is a play-it-safe kind of guy who would make a play-it-safe kind of pick, like a Tim Pawlenty, a [Louisiana Gov.] Bobby Jindal, a [Rob] Portman.\" \"Instead he goes for a much more risky, controversial pick, one that will obviously shore up his conservative base but greatly sharpen the debate over taxes and budgets. I think it shows [Romney] may be a bit more of a risk-taker than people imagined.\" Or not. It could be that Romney is actually making a very analytical pick after all. More Lichtman: \"It also may show, I don't know this, it's speculation, that maybe his internal polls were showing him that this race was looking pretty grim at this point and that he needed a shake-up kind of pick. It's not a Hail Mary pass like Sarah Palin was four years ago, but it is a shot down the field, not a safe route down the middle. So it has a chance to connect for a touchdown, or it could be intercepted with the ball going the other way.\" James Thurber, director of the Center for Congressional and Presidential Studies at American University, told It's All Politics: \"It's bold in the sense that he's selecting somebody who's really on the right who can solidify the right for him and make sure that they turn out and vote. I think he was careful about his selection. It certainly wasn't a Sarah Palin thing at the last minute. And he vetted all the candidates very carefully.\" \"Vice presidents rarely help in the Electoral College, so he didn't go for [Fla. Sen. Marco] Rubio or Portman or somebody like that. I think he was analytic about this. And yet the positions of Ryan are certainly going to be headlines for a while because the're so controversial.\" Romney's cautious approach, often data-driven, comes through repeatedly in The Real Romney, the definitive biography of the former Massachusetts governor written by Boston Globe journalists Michael Kranish and Scott Helman. For instance, before Romney accepted the opportunity to leave the Bain & Co. consulting firm to start Bain Capital, a venture capital and private equity firm, Romney held out until his boss agreed that if the new company failed: \"Romney would get his old job and salary back plus any raises he would have earned during his absence. Still, Romney worried about the impact on his reputation if he proved unable to do the job. Again, the pot was sweetened. [Bill] Bain promised that, if necessary, he would craft a cover story saying that Romney's return to Bain & Co. was needed because of his value as a consultant. 'So' Bain explained, 'there was no financial or professional risk.' This time Romney said yes.\" Kranish and Helman also report that at Bain Capital, Romney's caution when it came to investing in deals could at times frustrate his partners, who were more forward-leaning on deals. Kranish and Helman report on a Bain partner's observation of Romney: \"Whereas most entrepreneurs accepted failure as an inherent part of the game, the partner said, Romney worried that a single flop would bring disgrace. Every calculation had to be made with care.\" Kranish and Helman report that Romney apparently got somewhat more aggressive over the course of his business career. Certainly, anyone who gets as far as Romney has in national politics \u2014 a few weeks from becoming his party's official nominee \u2014 by definition is a risk taker. Now, we get to see if Romney's risky choice of Ryan helps more than hurts the man who would be president.",

Paul Ryan is popular with conservatives and brings enthusiasm to the ticket. He won his House seat at 28, which means that now, at 42, he's a seasoned legislator. Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney's newly announced running mate, Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan, has youth and experience. A conservative from a swing state, he has big ideas and the policy chops to back them up. He also brings a kind of enthusiasm Romney could use: He's a darling of the conservative base that Romney has had a harder time winning over. Back in February, when the Republican primary was still in full swing and the party's right wing was conspicuously unhappy with the idea of Romney, tax hawk Grover Norquist told the Conservative Political Action Conference: \"We don't need a president to tell us what direction to go. We know what direction we want to go. We want the Paul Ryan budget, which cuts spending [by] $6 trillion.\" Road Map To Controversy Ryan's pedigree is strong. He worked on the staffs of Kansas Sen. Sam Brownback and the late Republican luminary Jack Kemp. He won his own seat at 28, which means that now, at 42, he's a seasoned legislator. But it's Ryan's ideas that first catapulted him into political stardom. The budget plan he introduced in 2010, or the \"road map\" as he called it, ignited a major debate within Congress. \"The road map gives you universal access to affordable health insurance for every American, and it makes Medicare and Medicaid and Social Security permanently solvent,\" Ryan said in an interview with then-PBS host Charlie Rose. \"We can't have these entitlements designed like they are right now.\" Ryan's budget was instantly controversial. It called for sweeping cuts to social programs, and, most troubling for seniors, would have changed Medicare from a guaranteed benefit to a voucher program. Still, Republicans lined up behind it and rode the plan to a sweep of the House, giving Ryan the chairmanship of the budget committee. Within a few months, the House passed the Ryan budget (although the Senate did not). That's the kind of energy a Romney candidacy could use. But interestingly, the very thing that makes Ryan a Republican star makes him deeply troubling to others. Political Backlash? Last year, fresh from the House vote that passed his budget, Ryan met angry constituents outside a town hall meeting in Kenosha, Wis. Inside the meeting, Ryan tried to explain his budget's cuts to future Medicare benefits and its lower corporate tax rates, but was interrupted by protesters. This is the real danger for Romney with his pick of Ryan \u2014 the possibility of igniting the anger of voters who favor a stronger safety net, including seniors and many independents. Ryan's plan would slash social spending \u2014 from Head Start to health care \u2014 while cutting taxes on businesses and the wealthy. The Obama campaign has seized on this, calling the plan the \"Romney-Ryan budget.\" There's some evidence that narrative could work for Democrats. In a 2011 special election in upstate New York, Democratic Rep. Kathy Hochul ran ads against Republican Jane Corwin, linking Corwin to Ryan's budget plan. The ads \u2014 targeted at independents \u2014 worked. The Democrats picked up a seat that had been owned by the GOP for 40 years. Now, even some Republicans are running against the Ryan plan, like Montana Rep. Denny Rehberg, a Senate candidate. A recent pro-Rehberg campaign ad notes that he \"refused to support a budget plan that could harm the Medicare program so many of Montana's seniors rely on.\" So, while Ryan could boost enthusiasm in the GOP, that might come at a high price: That is, firming up the Democrats' narrative about Romney \u2014 that he's more concerned with business and wealth than he is about people.",

A vast majority of farmers are protected from crop losses with federally backed insurance. The line at the cavernous Smokey Row Coffee House in Oskaloosa stretched out the door and down the block, so long that dozens of Iowans waiting to see presidential candidate Barack Obama had to settle for a peek through the windows. It was July 4, 2007, heady days for Obama in the Hawkeye State, where Democratic caucusgoers would soon launch him as a legitimate national contender, and where state voters would later turn out in record numbers to help put the first-term Illinois senator into the White House. Five years, a national recession and a divisive health-care battle later, Obama's luster has dimmed in Iowa. He's now locked in a dead-heat battle with a candidate never fully embraced by state Republicans: GOP presidential nominee-in-waiting Mitt Romney. Both are competing hard for the swing state's crucial six electoral votes. Romney just finished up his fourth Iowa presidential campaign visit, and Obama on Monday begins his fifth \u2014 a bus tour that will take him across the drought-stricken state, including a planned stop back in Oskaloosa. There he can expect to find past supporters who, like Crystal Carman, 30, are warier, more worried and sapped of the new-start energy that fueled Obama's improbable rise here in the heart of the heartland. \"I'm still fairly undecided, and I'll pick based on who has the most common sense to keep things stable or make them better,\" says Carman, taking a break from working on her computer in a snug booth at Smokey Row. The Smokey Row Coffee House, across from Oskaloosa's central square, is quieter these days than it was on July 4, 2007, when throngs of the curious stopped by hoping to get a glimpse of presidential candidate Barack Obama.

She works in the human resources department of a local electronic components company that has rebounded from layoffs in 2009 \u2014 its first in more than three decades. \"People are aware of what happened and what could still happen,\" she says. Right Track Or Wrong Track? Iowa has an economy that never felt the full brunt of the recession. Its unemployment rate stands at just over 5 percent and never rose much north of 6 percent, even when the nation was losing 800,000 jobs a month and reached a 10 percent unemployment rate. An Iowa Workforce Development report this year found that the state's housing market had stabilized, the agriculture sector was strong and \"farmland values in Iowa reached a historical peak in 2011.\" Those values increased to $6,708 an acre in the midst of the corn-for-ethanol boom driven by federal rules requiring that oil companies create billions of gallons of ethanol blends annually. That would seem to play in Obama's favor, but, says David Yepsen, the former longtime Des Moines Register political columnist, \"there's a difference between the unemployment numbers and how people feel.\" \"What's important is whether people feel the country is on the right track or the wrong track,\" says Yepsen, now director of the Paul Simon Public Policy Institute at Southern Illinois University in Carbondale. \"Many have a job, but are scared, and they know other people who are scared.\" There are also many conservatives who, like Jackie Eastridge, 59, a private practice nurse from Mitchellville, say they are convinced that while the state is stable and Obama is \"well-intentioned,\" he's \"ruining the economy.\" \"He's a socialist,\" Eastridge said recently as she left the Des Moines weekend farmers market with a bagful of purchases. \"He's misguided, and they'll mess up health care just like they messed up Medicare and Medicaid.\" Enter The Drought In Iowa, that right track/wrong track calculation has recently been complicated by a historic heat wave and accompanying drought that has devastated a large swath of the state's corn fields. \"It makes people cranky,\" says Mike Schirm, 58, a farmer, country road worker and staunch conservative from Peru, Iowa, \"but the last I looked, Romney couldn't do anything about rain, and neither can Obama.\" And while the drought may put people in a bad mood and could ultimately influence food prices, those seemingly most directly affected \u2014 the farmers \u2014 are on pace for another year of record revenues. \"I know that there's a psychological downer effect for farmers in Iowa seeing their crops not perform as well as expected,\" says Bruce Babcock, an economics professor and director of the Biobased Industry Center at Iowa State University. \"But $3-to-$5 billion in federally backed crop insurance will go to those farmers, depending on how severe their losses.\" \"And those checks will start arriving in October and November,\" Babcock says. In 2011, he says, 90 percent of Iowa's corn and soybean acreage was insured, a level likely equaled or exceeded this year. Taxpayers fund 62 percent of the cost of crop insurance payments, he says. \"To hear some people talk, there is no role for government in our economy,\" Babcock says. \"But when it comes to agriculture, I guess all politics is local.\" Another local issue that has caused controversy in the state is a debate over wind energy tax credits. Romney has opposed credits for the industry, while Obama and leading Iowa Republicans, including Gov. Terry Branstad, support them. But the big question for Obama in Iowa is likely to be the same as it is in other key states around the country: how and whether he'll get under-30 voters who helped fuel his win in 2008 to the polls this November, says Yepsen. \"If they're sitting on their hands, that's a problem,\" he says. Carole Comstock of Oskaloosa says she'll likely vote for Obama again, even though her dream of seeing the country unite after the 2008 election has gone unfulfilled. Comstock says she blames Congress for not giving Obama a chance to succeed.\n                \n                    \n                    Liz Halloran/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Carole Comstock of Oskaloosa says she'll likely vote for Obama again, even though her dream of seeing the country unite after the 2008 election has gone unfulfilled. Comstock says she blames Congress for not giving Obama a chance to succeed. Courting Voters Tom Henderson, Democratic chairman of voter-rich Polk County, which includes Des Moines, says the campaign is keying in on young people and encouraging early voting. \"The Obama people believe that they'll get beat on the air, but will win on the ground,\" Henderson said recently at a candidate fundraising event. The most recent poll of Iowa voters, by Democratic-leaning Public Policy Polling, found nearly half disapprove of Obama's job performance. The same July poll found Romney with a 55 percent unfavorable rating. Nationally, 40 percent of Americans view Romney favorably, according to a recent ABC News-Washington Post survey, while 53 percent have a favorable view of Obama. Both campaigns, and the political action committees that support them, have been focusing ad buys in Iowa. An analysis for NBC found that three of the top 10 hottest television markets for presidential ads last week were in the Hawkeye State. Iowa Republicans, their rolls bolstered by a hard-fought presidential caucus in January, have a voter-registration advantage over Democrats, 620,584 to 598,995. In November 2008, registered Democrats outnumbered Republicans by more than 100,000. Still, nearly 660,000 Iowans are registered under \"no party,\" according to the secretary of state's August totals. Striking A Chord What's resonating with Iowa voters? For Carole Comstock, 65, a retired elementary teacher from Oskaloosa and an Obama supporter, it's that she believes the president is \"looking after women and those of us in the middle.\" An Obama ad on heavy rotation in Iowa paints Romney's positions on women's health issues \u2014 he supports overturning Roe v. Wade and opposes insurance mandates covering contraception \u2014 as straight out of the 1950s. That ad has also resonated with Carman, the undecided voter, who says that Romney can seem \"out of touch.\" When Obama visits Oskaloosa, Comstock says, \"I want to hear him say that [he's] going to work for everyone. I just don't think that things are as bad as they're made out to be.\" But Romney's opposition to abortion and his stand against same-sex marriage \u2014 which Obama endorsed earlier this year \u2014 is attractive to the strong Christian conservative segment of the state's GOP base, people like Amy Valentine, 32, of Oskaloosa. \"A candidate's Christian values and pro-life stance are more important to me than the economy,\" says Valentine, a stay-at-home mother of three who was taking a break at Smokey Row before picking her children up at Sunday school. Valentine, who is married to a police officer, says she'd prefer it if Romney were not of the Mormon faith, but his positions on social issues satisfy her. 'It's All Coming Down To Milk And Bread' Romney's recent line of attack on Obama over changes he's suggested to work requirements for welfare recipients is likely to play well in the conservative areas surrounding the population center of Des Moines. The Obama administration has said it will allow states to apply for waivers to the welfare law's work requirements if they offer an alternative that works better for their particular needs. A Romney ad charged that Obama wants to \"gut\" the work requirement \u2014 a claim that the independent fact-checking group Politifact concluded was not accurate. But the theme of hard work versus handouts is one that appeals to voters like Dawn Evenson, 60, who works at the Chamber of Commerce visitors center in Winterset in conservative Madison County, home of covered bridges and the birthplace of John Wayne. \"In order to enrich your life, you have to work, you have to struggle,\" Evenson said recently near the town's handsome, if parched, central square. \"I still think we're on the downturn. These are farmers who live here. They work for a living. They don't want handouts.\" Romney's most effective message to Iowans, she says, is his business background and \"his smarts\" \u2014 and that he's not Obama. \"He's got to talk about the economy,\" she says. \"It's all coming down to milk and bread.\" Back at the Des Moines farmers market, Obama supporters Alex and Anna Lyznik, both 59 and research scientists with the Pioneer seed company, said they expect a very close race in November. \"We are still very proud of Obama, and he should stick to the message that things are better than when he got to the White House,\" says Anna, who came with her husband to the U.S. from Poland 28 years ago. \"We really like Lech Walesa,\" she said, referring to her native country's former president, who recently expressed support for Romney. \"But we are not with him on this.\"",

We begin in the swing state of Florida, in hotly contested Hillsborough County, which includes Tampa. The county voted for Republican George W. Bush in 2004, then for Democrat Barack Obama in 2008. Here, First and Main are two gravel roads that meet in a trailer park in a suburban area called Lutz. The trailers have grown over the years, residents say, into full-sized homes \u2014 some have permanent rooms or carports attached. Just down the street from First and Main, we encounter kids standing on a waist-high pile of gravel, along with their mother, Katrina Bordwell \u2014 and a story about change in Florida. \"Our yard flooded so we have to raise it,\" Bordwell says. She's spreading the gravel across the yard, hoping to raise it above the water level. \"This whole street floods,\" she says. \"Pretty much all of Lutz floods.\" A flood of development has meant change to the landscape. Of course, in recent years, Florida real estate development took a dark turn. Bordwell works for a foreclosure company, where, she says, business is \"skyrocketing.\" Katrina Bordwell's home was flooded recently after nearby development stopped up a drainage pipe. Bordwell, 24, lives in the community with her children, from left, Leo, 3, her boyfriend's son Kyle Cose, 3, and Zoey, 5.\n                \n                    \n                    Becky Lettenberger/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Katrina Bordwell's home was flooded recently after nearby development stopped up a drainage pipe.

He manages this trailer park, after he shut down his business doing pest-control inspections on newly sold homes. \"I relied on real estate transactions, and when the housing market took a dump, so did my business,\" he says. 'I Haven't Seen Any Change' Florida's economy is recovering from the financial crisis that started five years ago \u2014 recovering, but not recovered. Susan MacManus \u2014 a political scientist whose family was among the first to develop land around here a century ago \u2014 stood with us at the corner of First and Main. \"One of the explanations for the 2010 election in Florida, which went heavily Republican after voting for Obama in 2008 \u2014 all you have to do is look at the pockets of foreclosures and the related unemployment, and you get a good picture for how things have changed and how much of a pressure it made on people,\" she says. \"Tampa's still, unfortunately, just had an upswing in foreclosures again. So it's a constant reminder to people: Everybody knows someone who's lost their home or is going to, or someone who has lost their job.\" Source: RealtyTrac (http://www.realtytrac.com/trendcenter/), U.S. Census Bureau (2010 Census), Bureau of Labor Statistics Credit: Alyson Hurt / NPR We came to this struggling area seeking richer information than we'd get from public opinion polls, by visiting voters where they live. The neighborhood around First and Main isn't rich, though it's comfortable. Right at the corner of First and Main, we find the carport where Ed Faucher is relaxing in the evening with his Pomeranian dog. He waves us in, through the chain-link fence.

And her and I had a few differences on it. So I said, 'You know what? I'm just going to go independent [and] vote the way I want.'\" He voted for John McCain in 2008 and opposes Obama in 2012. \"I don't hate him,\" Faucher says. \"I don't think he's done enough for the country. You know, all this talking about change \u2014 I haven't seen any change. Four billion dollars a day in debt every day. It goes up every time you wake up in the morning.\" Asked for his opinion about GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney, he says: \"Being I was from Massachusetts originally, I know people up there. When he put in his health care program, people were squawking about it, but I also know people [who] love it. You know, they say it's the best thing that ever happened. It got them off their fannies and they finally got health insurance.\" But while Faucher approves of what Romney did in Massachusetts, he's not on board with the similar federal health care law passed under Obama. \"I'm happy with what I got, really,\" he says. Faucher worries the new health care law could affect his choices under the federal Medicare program, which he likes. Health care remains the trickiest of political issues. 'That Gap Is Growing' When we tell Faucher of our plans to talk to a few of his neighbors, he says, \"I don't think anybody will give you any problem.\" And nobody did. Not even the guy just outside the trailer park, down the street from First and Main. He built a black steel fence with an electric-powered gate around his house. Roland Lamb and his wife live behind an automated gate across the street from the trailer park. The Lambs are malpractice lawyers.

The Lambs are malpractice lawyers. He voted for President Obama in 2008 and despite some frustrations will vote for him again. \"The truth is I'm not much of a good neighbor,\" he says. \"You can tell by my gargoyles. I'm not welcoming.\" Roland Lamb is a white-bearded man, who looks a little gruff, like the gargoyles that flank his gate. But he courteously stands to chat for a while. He and his wife built a ranch house on several acres beside a lake. The driveway curves across the perfect lawn like the yellow brick road. The gate faces the trailer park at First and Main. \"I've always voted Democratic,\" Lamb says. \"And I have a \u2014 it's kind of hard to get me to vote any other way. I'm not stupid but I, in general, I agree with their philosophy. I think there are a lot of people in this world that need help and there are a lot of people that are fabulously wealthy and that gap is growing and that's stupid. That's wrong, that's morally wrong in my opinion.\" Lamb says he and his wife are lucky. They chose a profession that's doing well, even in this economy. They are medical malpractice lawyers. And though Lamb is painfully aware that many of the neighbors are suffering, he does not blame the president. \"He's been in office fighting a bunch of right-wing nuts for most of that four years. I was disappointed in him early on; he could have accomplished a lot more,\" Lamb says. \"I hate the health care plan, but I don't hate it for the reasons most people do. I hate it because we've included the insurance companies as middlemen. And if people had a little bit of a brain, they'd realize that as long as we let insurance companies run this, we're just paying a big middleman, that's all we're doing. And things aren't going to change.\" Lamb voted for Obama in 2008, and whatever his disappointments, he plans to do it again in 2012. That is the most common pattern we found in Hillsborough County, Fla. The way people voted in 2008 \u2014 for or against the president \u2014 signals their perception of everything that's happened since and, usually, the way they intend to vote this fall. The rarest voter is a person who's changed his mind.",

            "article_content": "Nearly every major poll indicates that the top issues for voters are jobs and the economy. Making the wealthy pay more in income taxes? Not so much, at least according to a new USA Today/Gallup poll. An excerpt from Gallup: \"Creating good jobs, reducing corruption in the federal government, and reducing the federal budget deficit score highest when Americans rate 12 issues as priorities for the next president to address. Americans assign much less importance to increasing taxes on wealthy Americans and dealing with environmental concerns.\" In fact, higher taxes for the rich was given the lowest priority of the dozen issues, Gallup reports. Respondents rated \"extremely important\" the following issues: \"creating good jobs\" (48 percent of resondents); \"reducing corruption in the federal government\" (45 percent); \"reducing the federal budget deficit\" (44 percent); \"dealing with terrorism and other international threats\" (42 percent). After a number of other issues, it jumps down to \"dealing with environmental concerns, such as global warming,\" (21 percent). The same percentage \u2014 21 percent \u2014 cited \"increasing taxes on wealthy Americans\" as an extremely important issue. The poll would seem to indicate that the fairness arguments made by President Obama and his campaign aren't top concerns for voters. What's really striking about the poll results is that not only was this true of voters in the aggregate but of self-identified Obama voters, too. Among Obama supporters, only 32 percent said raising taxes on the wealthy should be a top priority of the next president. That also put it dead last on the list of 12 issues among that demographic. The top issue in terms of presidential priorities for self-identified Obama supporters was available and affordable health care, at 50 percent. Jobs, better public schools and safeguarding Social Security and Medicare tied at 48 percent. Meanwhile, cutting federal deficits was viewed as the top priority for the next president by 51 percent of the respondents who described themselves as supporters of Republican Mitt Romney. Job creation was next at 48 percent and reducing federal government corruption and dealing with terrorism were tied at 45 percent. So why does Obama keep talking about raising tax rates on the wealthy when even most of his supporters, according to Gallup, don't see that as among the top priorities for the next president? A possible answer is that in an election that's expected to be very close, every voter matters. Clearly, there are a number of voters in Obama's base who do believe higher taxes for the wealthy is a priority. So a message that appeals to those voters could prove important in getting to victory. So long as it doesn't turn off enough other voters.",

Paul Ryan has youth and experience, he's a conservative from a swing state, and he has big ideas and the policy chops to back them up. But the chairman of the House Budget Committee would not be the safest of choices. Back in February, when the Republican primary was still in full swing and the party's right wing was conspicuously unhappy with the idea of Romney, tax hawk Grover Norquist spoke to the Conservative Political Action Conference. \"We are not auditioning for fearless leader,\" said Norquist. \"We don't need a president to tell us what direction to go. We know what direction we want to go. We want the Paul Ryan budget, which cuts spending $6 trillion.\" Roadmap To Controversy That kind of enthusiasm is something Romney could use \u2014 a boost from a conservative darling like Ryan. Ryan's pedigree is strong. He worked on the staffs of Kansas Sen. Sam Brownback and the late Republican luminary Jack Kemp. He won his own seat at 28, which means that now, at 42, he's a seasoned legislator. But it's Ryan's ideas that first catapulted him into political stardom. The budget plan he introduced in 2010, or the \"road map,\" as he called it, ignited a major debate within Congress. \"The road map gives you universal access to affordable health insurance for every American, and it makes Medicare and Medicaid and Social Security permanently solvent,\" Ryan said in an interview with then-PBS host Charlie Rose. \"We can't have these entitlements designed like they are right now.\" Ryan's budget was instantly controversial. It called for sweeping cuts to social programs, and, most troubling for seniors, would have changed Medicare from a guaranteed benefit to a voucher program. Still, Republicans lined up behind it and rode the plan to a sweep of the House, giving Ryan the chairmanship of the Budget Committee. Within a few months, the House passed the Ryan budget (although the Senate did not). That's the kind of energy a Romney candidacy could use. But interestingly, the very thing that makes Ryan a Republican star makes him deeply troubling to others. Political Backlash? Last year, fresh from the House vote that passed his budget, Ryan met angry constituents outside a town hall meeting in Kenosha, Wis. Inside the meeting, Ryan tried to explain his budget's cuts to future Medicare benefits and its lower corporate tax rates, but was interrupted by protesters. This is the real danger for Romney if he were to pick Ryan \u2014 igniting the anger of voters who favor a stronger safety net, including seniors and many independents. Ryan's plan would slash social spending \u2014 from Head Start to health care \u2014 while cutting taxes on businesses and the wealthy. The Obama campaign has seized on this, calling the plan the \"Romney-Ryan budget.\" There's some evidence that narrative could work for Democrats. In a 2011 special election in upstate New York, Democratic Rep. Kathy Hochul ran ads against Republican Jane Corwin, ads targeted at independents linking Corwin to Ryan's budget plan. The ads worked. The Democrats picked up a seat that had been owned by the GOP for 40 years. Now, even some Republicans are running against the Ryan plan, like Montana Rep. Denny Rehberg, a Senate candidate. A recent pro-Rehberg campaign ad notes that he \"refused to support a budget plan that could harm the Medicare program so many of Montana's seniors rely on.\" So, while it's true that Ryan could boost enthusiasm in the GOP, that might come at too high a price. That is, firming up the Democrats' narrative about Romney \u2014 that he's more concerned with business and wealth than he is about people.",

STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: And I'm Steve Inskeep. Good morning. We are gathering information at this hour out of Aurora, Colorado, where there are reports of a mass shooting - a multiple shooting at a movie theater. The theater was playing - among other things - the premiere of the new Batman movie, early hours of this morning, when shots rang out. Witnesses describe hearing a large number of gunshots. We have a variety of reports on casualties. One of them comes from the police chief in Aurora, Colorado, who's telling a local TV station he believes there is a minimum of 10 dead, dozens injured. We do have many reports of injuries going in to local hospitals - although we should stress, it is very, very early here; and all facts are approximate, at best. A University of Colorado hospital spokeswoman describes a number of wounded,  injuries ranging from moderate-severe. Again, this happened in Aurora, Colorado, where a Batman movie was premiering, in the early hours of this morning. Now, we're going to cover other news here this morning, as we continue chasing that story. President Obama was campaigning last night in Florida, which is one of the major swing states in this fall's election. And NPR's Greg Allen reports from West Palm Beach. GREG ALLEN, BYLINE: For Democratic candidates running for office in Palm Beach County, the road usually runs through Century Village. Countless county commissioners and state legislators have visited this retirement community; also, Joe Biden and John Kerry. Last night, President Obama found his visit also involved running a gauntlet of grandmothers. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Now first of all, I just want to say, that's the most kisses I've gotten at any campaign event. (LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE) ALLEN: Nearly 700 people packed into the retirement community's clubhouse. David Israel, a resident who introduced the president, said there's a good reason why Century Village was chosen for the campaign stop. DAVID ISRAEL: Last presidential election, Democrats pulled 69 percent of the vote here. ALLEN: Right here in Century Village? ISRAEL: Right here. Sixty-nine percent of the Democratic vote, here in Century Village. ALLEN: A little more than four years ago, Barack Obama had some supporters here. But another Democrat running for the presidency, Hillary Clinton, was even more popular. Israel says in this Democratic stronghold, he sees far more enthusiasm among seniors for Mr. Obama now, than four years ago. As for the issues, Israel says among the seniors that he knows, Medicare is at the top of the list. ISRAEL: Number one because people are very concerned about their health-care coverage. It's critical in here. And most people in here are fixed income - Social Security. You know, where's the money going to come from, if that safety net goes away? ALLEN: That's a theme President Obama is only too happy to emphasize, especially Mitt Romney's support for Congressman Paul Ryan's plan that would cap Medicare benefits through a voucher program. OBAMA: One independent, nonpartisan study found that under a similar plan, seniors would have to pay nearly $6,400 for Medicare, than they do today. Where you going to get that from? Where you going to get it from? ALLEN: Four years ago, although Barack Obama won Florida, he lost the senior vote in the state to John McCain. Dave Aronberg is a former Democratic member of the Florida Legislature, who represented this district. He expects President Obama to do better among seniors in Florida this time, in part because he doesn't think Romney has the connection with senior voters that McCain did. DAVE ARONBERG: Also, I think that the senior community has seen President Obama's policies, and are more comfortable with him. He was - you know, he was brand-new four years ago. And now, I think people realize that he's there to protect Medicare and Social Security. And I think they'll vote for him, at the end of the day. ALLEN: At the same time, the last four years have not been kind to Florida. The recession, and the collapse of the housing market, brought this state's growth-based economy to a standstill. Retiree Dan Stifter says that was a blow to seniors, many of whom live on fixed incomes and have their nest eggs in their homes. Still, Stifter says he doesn't agree with those who say the president hasn't done enough to restore the economy. And in his neighborhood, he says, homes are beginning to sell. DAN STIFTER: Well, I think it's getting better, you know - I mean, slowly but surely. This thing took awhile to develop. It's not going to be cured in just four years, and maybe not even eight years. Maybe not even for 12 years. But eventually, I think it'll all come back. ALLEN: In Florida, senior citizens are an important voting bloc because there are so many of them - and they all vote. Seniors make up about a fifth of the state's population, but they comprise nearly a third of registered voters. Aronberg says that's why seniors - along with the fast-growing Hispanic population - may determine the outcome of the race in Florida. ARONBERG: Those votes are up for grabs. It's going to be a close election. And that's why the president, I expect, will be back here several times more, before the election - because Florida could decide the election yet again, and it is going to be razor-thin. ALLEN: The president continues his Florida swing today, with stops in Fort Myers and Orlando. But the Sunshine State will be seeing even more of Mitt Romney next month, when he accepts his party's nomination at the Republican Convention in Tampa.

Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., participates in last week's National Puerto Rican Day Parade in New York City.\n                \n                    \n                    Richard Drew/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., participates in last week's National Puerto Rican Day Parade in New York City. An interesting case of identity politics is playing out in New York's newly drawn 13th Congressional District, which includes Harlem and parts of the Bronx. Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., faces four much younger competitors in next week's Democratic primary, in what could be the toughest re-election bid of his long political career. NPR's Corey Dade explains: \"Gentrification in Harlem has pushed out scores of black residents who have been Rangel's core supporters. And the boundaries of his congressional district have been redrawn to include a portion of the Bronx, making the population majority Hispanic. \"Rangel will face four challengers in the June 26 Democratic primary. His greatest threat is expected to come from New York state Sen. Adriano Espaillat, who is trying to mobilize fellow Latinos behind his goal of becoming the first member of Congress born in the Dominican Republic.\" Rangel, who turned 82 last week, is a founding member of the Congressional Black Caucus and has represented the historically African-American community of Harlem for 42 years. USA Today noted recently that \"nearly three in 10 district residents have never previously been represented\" by Rangel. It also said: \"Ethnic politics are playing a key role in the primary June 26. Espaillat is the leading contender among the four candidates challenging Rangel, and he is the only Hispanic in an otherwise African-American field.\" Except that's not entirely true. Rangel is half Puerto Rican; his father was born in Puerto Rico. Yet Rangel rarely discusses that side of his heritage. Last month, The New York Times reported on an endorsement from Rep. Jos\u00e9 E. Serrano, who referred to \"those of us who represent New York City and are from the Latino community, as Charlie and I both are.\" But even while appearing at the National Puerto Rican Day Parade along New York's Fifth Avenue, as local politicians customarily do each year, Rangel seemed reticent to declare too loudly a Latino heritage or connection. \"I can't imagine a better birthday present than celebrating the rich culture and heritage of the beautiful island of Puerto Rico,\" he said in a statement. \"To the tens of thousands of Puerto Ricans in my district and millions in our country, I thank you for your unique contributions to American society.\" The New York Times cited Rangel's relationship with his father as a reason he doesn't identify closely with the Puerto Rican part of his background. \"When he abandoned my mom as a kid, that ended it as far as the relationship,\" Rangel told reporters, according to the Times. \"It's a painful relationship, and I don't talk about it because I've never had any experiences there.\" Rangel added that he \"never really enjoyed any of the cultural riches of a Puerto Rican background.\" In an interview with Fox News Latino, Rangel said: \"I don't know whether the number of any particular Latino group has made or will make any particular difference in the issues that I am concerned with.\" Rangel acknowledged the strong challenge from Espaillat. \"If you are Dominican and you see a Dominican running to become president, become governor, becoming [an elected official], you tell your son, 'Hey, if he can do it, you can do it,' \" Rangel told Fox News Latino. \"On the other hand, if you got problems like unemployment, Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare, there's a guy that's always been there for you and for your family, then you say, 'He's a nice guy. I don't know where he came from or how long he's been here, but Charlie Rangel's the man.' And that's what I'm relying on.\"",

Gabrielle Giffords, left, celebrates with Ron Barber after he won Tuesday's special election in Arizona to serve the remaining seven months of her term. Like Giffords, Barber is a Democrat. He's also a former Giffords aide. In a race seen as \"a testing ground for Democratic and Republican messages\" that will be used from now through Nov. 6, Democrat Ron Barber won Tuesday's special election in Arizona to fill the remaining seven months of former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords' term. And in one of Tuesday's other most-watched votes, North Dakotans agreed that \"it's time to retire University of North Dakota's Fighting Sioux nickname.\" Some highlights and notes about Tuesday's results: -- NPR's Ted Robbins reports from Arizona that the special election \"was not as close as many expected. In his first try for public office, Barber beat his opponent by almost seven points. ... Voters apparently didn't buy the strategy of Barber's Republican opponent, Tea Party favorite Jesse Kelly, who with the help of the national GOP tried to tie Barber to President Obama.\" Giffords, you'll recall, was shot and seriously wounded during a January 2011 shooting rampage at an event she was hosting in Tucson. Six people were killed and 13 \u2014 including Barber \u2014 were injured. Giffords announced this past January that she would give up her seat. As the Arizona Republic writes, the Arizona race became a testing ground for the major parties' themes as: \"Kelly promoted a strict diet of lower taxes, growing jobs and reducing gas prices by increasing American energy production. Republican campaign advertising worked to tie Barber to the unpopular policies of President Barack Obama and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, such as the health-care plan. \"Democrats, on the other hand, hammered Kelly on statements about privatizing Social Security, phasing out Medicare and opposing any corporate income tax. Barber called Kelly too 'extreme' for the district and promised to embrace bipartisanship, touting moderate Republican supporters and distancing himself from Obama.\" -- In North Dakota, as The Bismarck Tribune reports, \"with 97 percent of precincts reporting, more than 67 percent of voters had voted yes on Measure 4, rejecting this latest effort by [Fighting Sioux] nickname supporters to preserve the moniker. ... With its passage, Measure 4 repeals Senate Bill 2370, which was passed during the Legislature's November 2011 special session. The bill repealed Section 15-10-46 of North Dakota Century Code, which the Legislature passed in spring 2011. Section 15-10-46 required UND to use the Fighting Sioux nickname and logo.\" As NPR's Cheryl Corley has reported, \"in 2005, the [NCAA] called Native American mascots and nicknames used by 18 schools 'hostile and abusive.' To keep the names, the NCAA told schools, the schools had to get permission from the tribes their sports teams were named after. Otherwise, the teams would be sanctioned; they would not be able to use any of the Native American imagery during post-season play and they would not be able to host lucrative NCAA championships. ... UND is the last of the 18 schools to come to terms with the NCAA policy.\" One of two Lakota, or Sioux, tribes had declined to give its OK for use of the nickname. -- \"Elsewhere Tuesday,\" The Associated Press writes, \" Virginia, Maine, Nevada, Arkansas and South Carolina held primary elections \u2014 with most of those states choosing Senate nominees. ... In Virginia, former Sen. George Allen brushed aside three rivals in the Republican Senate primary. Allen's victory set up a November clash with another former Virginia governor, Democrat Tim Kaine. ... \"In Nevada, Republican Sen. Dean Heller and Democratic Rep. Shelley Berkley easily defeated a slate of political unknowns in their respective primaries. ... In Maine, state Sen. Cynthia Dill won the Democratic primary in the race to succeed Republican Sen. Olympia Snowe. Maine Secretary of State Charles Summers won the GOP nomination. The front-runner, former two-term Gov. Angus King, wasn't on the ballot because he's running as an independent.\" (For ongoing coverage of the 2012 campaign, check It's All Politics.)",

Republicans need a net pickup of four seats to win control of the U.S. Senate this November. One opportunity they see is in North Dakota, where longtime Democratic incumbent Kent Conrad has decided not to run for a sixth term. Republican Rep. Rick Berg is expected to win the GOP nomination in next Tuesday's primary. If he does, he'll face Democrat Heidi Heitkamp. It's a race where outside spending has already come into play, and where Heitkamp has already begun distinguishing her politics from those of President Obama, who lost the state by nearly 9 percentage points to Republican John McCain in 2008. Running Blue In A Red State Standing on the deck of her comfortable home on the bank of the Missouri River in Mandan, N.D., Heitkamp points to a massive cottonwood tree growing by the river's edge in her backyard. \"It's an enormous tree and it's been there a long, long time. We always like to tell people we think Lewis and Clark stopped and maybe leaned against it to check out the river,\" says Heitkamp. Heitkamp is a former state tax commissioner and attorney general. She lost a campaign for governor, but won a fight against breast cancer. Now 56, she's running for statewide office again. This week, Heitkamp released a campaign ad about a convicted rapist she tried to keep locked up. Nowhere in the spot does Heitkamp mention her Democratic party affiliation. And she's been highly critical of President Obama, questioning his energy policy and criticizing him for opposing the Keystone XL pipeline. Recently she raised eyebrows in Washington when she said the president has failed to unite the country. In a recent interview with NPR, Heitkamp clarified those remarks: \"What I said is ... that the president was handed a test, which was uniting the country, and we're even more divided than we were, I think, in 2008. And that is a source of great concern to the American public.\" Rep. Rick Berg, R-N.D., speaks before the state's GOP Convention in Bismarck, N.D. on March 31.\n                \n                    \n                    Will Kincaid/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Rep. Rick Berg, R-N.D., speaks before the state's GOP Convention in Bismarck, N.D. on March 31. Heitkamp is distancing herself from the president, like several other Democratic candidates running in parts of the country where Obama is unpopular. It might be said that Heitkamp's views on the president have evolved. The conservative group Crossroads GPS aired an ad in North Dakota featuring a video clip it unearthed of Heitkamp from 2008, where she says: \"I think Barack Obama's going to be amazing and I think that we are on our way to a better United States.\" The ad then goes on to say: \"Tell Heidi, Obamacare is not the way to a better United States. Support the repeal of Obamacare.\" The Crossroads GPS ad is aimed at helping Berg, the Republican, a real estate developer and former state lawmaker who is completing his first term in North Dakota's only U.S. House seat. Now, he's running for the Senate. \"You know, that's where the problem is right now,\" says Berg. \"I mean, if we want to change America, we've got to change the Senate and we've had over 30 bipartisan bills that we've passed in the House that basically are sitting in the Senate and not being brought up, not being debated. So that has to change.\" North Dakota As Model For Washington Berg, 52, holds traditional Republican views: keep taxes low, cut spending, shrink government. Berg spoke with NPR following last week's grim jobs numbers report, which showed an uptick in the unemployment rate. \"That's exactly why I'm running for the Senate. There is so much uncertainty in our country,\" he says. \"Business out there doesn't know what the rules are going to be, what regulations are coming out. They don't know what the taxes are going to be. If they invest in something, they don't know how they're going to be taxed as they get revenue out. In North Dakota, that doesn't happen.\" Berg says he wants Washington run more like North Dakota, which has the nation's lowest unemployment rate, 3 percent. That's largely due to the oil boom in the western part of the state. If Heitkamp has her way, the Senate race will be fought over issues like Berg's support for the House budget plan sponsored by Wisconsin Republican Paul Ryan, which she says would cut Medicare and something else important to North Dakota \u2014 farm subsidies. Voters in the state are likely to be deluged with campaign ads in the coming months, says University of North Dakota political science professor Mark Jendrysik. \"I think you're going to see a lot of spending, a lot of money. I think there's going to be a veritable blizzard of advertising and I think Congressman Berg certainly has a lot of personal resources,\" says Jendrysik. \"I think the Republicans have put a very high priority nationally on flipping this seat over. It's unclear to me if Ms. Heitkamp can raise that kind of money ... and it's unclear if the national Democrats are really going to try to invest.\" The Heitkamp campaign points out that it raised slightly more money than Berg in April and May, but Berg has a large advantage in cash on hand. Democrats have a poll showing their candidate ahead, but an independent poll released by a North Dakota media group has Berg up by 7 percentage points. With Obama at the top of the ticket in a reliably red state, North Dakota presents Democrats with one of their toughest Senate challenges \u2014 and Republicans with one of their best hopes this fall.",

            "article_content": "One of the big story lines in this year's presidential election is the unprecedented role of outside money. Millions are being raised and spent by groups that back one candidate or another. Those groups are buying advertisements, often to launch attacks on the candidates they don't like. It's an area where pro-Republican ads have overwhelmingly outnumbered those backing Democrats. One place these ads are hard to miss is in Iowa. It's not even summer yet, and the dust from the primaries has barely settled. But in battleground states, things seem especially intense already this election season. Just ask 27-year-old Anders Dovre from Slater, Iowa. \"The campaign? Did it ever stop?\" Typically in Iowa, you get the caucuses in January, and then it's usually pretty quiet until Labor Day or so. But last month alone, in Des Moines and Cedar Rapids, there were more than 250 TV ads promoting President Obama, and nearly the same amount for Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, according to numbers compiled by the Wesleyan Media Project. \"Normally, we kind of get some time off,\" says voter Bryan Dolezal, who runs a business in Cedar Rapids. \"Lately it's been constant. [As] soon as one election's done, you start hearing about the next one already.\" The big change this year is the rise of the outside advocacy groups, which are paying for most of the ads \u2014 often with contributions from wealthy, anonymous donors. In the Iowa TV spots last month, just over half of the pro-Obama ads were official campaign spots, while none of the Romney ads were. All of them came from an outside group. Such ads sound and look like any other campaign spot \u2014 and that's the point. An ad attacking the president from Crossroads GPS, a group co-founded by Republican strategist Karl Rove, says: \"President Obama's agenda promised so much,\" before ticking off promises it says he's broken. Meanwhile, a pro-Obama ad from the superPAC Priorities USA Action, hits Romney, saying: \"Romney's proposing a huge new $150,000 tax cut for the wealthiest 1 percent, while cutting Medicare and education for us.\" The only way to tell who paid for any given ad is to pay close attention all the way to the very end. It's easy for the average voter to be confused, says Dennis Goldford, a professor at Drake University. \"Even if you want to wait till the end of the ad and view who they're sponsored by, just visually, even with a high-def television, it's sometimes very hard to read that fine print, and you've got to remember to do it,\" Goldford says. In two days interviewing voters in Iowa, no one said this big increase in outside money, much of it from anonymous donors, is a good thing. Still, some, like John Olson, 42, from Ankeny, say they have been able to tune it out so far. \"I haven't seen a whole lot of it,\" he says. \"I actually, strangely enough, have been watching less TV. So I have not seen a whole lot of those ads yet.\" But Olson is troubled by what the influx of cash means. So too is Dovre, the 27-year-old from Slater, who is a high school teacher. \"I teach them and tell them they have a voice in this process, and more and more I feel like I'm telling them a lie,\" he says. \"I tell them every day you need to have an opinion \u2014 an informed opinion \u2014 and you need to act on it. And more and more, it seems like I'm telling them that for nothing.\" In the city of Urbandale, Dean Kleckner, a conservative Republican and retired farmer, also says the current system doesn't work. His solution? No limits on spending or contributions, but he says they should go directly to political parties or to candidates, and there should be full disclosure. \"So let's not limit the amount, but let's say they have to report it immediately or within a reasonable amount of time, and let people make up their own minds about whether that person is being influenced by the money or not,\" Kleckner says. Now, voters have for many, many years complained about the role of money in U.S. elections. So that's nothing new. But even if the economy remains the big issue this year, outside cash is something many voters are increasingly aware of \u2014 and they are talking about it.",

Newt Gingrich has experienced a long slide since March 6, when he won Georgia's Republican primary. It was his second and final victory of the campaign season, but Gingrich fought to stay in the race through a Southern strategy that never caught on. On Wednesday, a source close to the Gingrich campaign told NPR that he would officially suspend his campaign next week, and was likely to formally endorse Mitt Romney. Gingrich announced his run nearly a year ago, last May, on Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. It wasn't long before Gingrich ruffled feathers, even those of his fellow Republicans. On NBC's Meet the Press, he criticized Rep. Paul Ryan's budget plan, which included a proposal to overhaul Medicare, as \"right-wing social engineering.\" The campaign had a shaky start. Most of his staff resigned in June, citing Gingrich's lack of commitment and a Greek Isles cruise he took with his third wife, Callista. But the former House speaker was able to hang on through the summer and over a long series of debates, where he took on the roles of party statesman, partisan brawler and media critic. By December, with other candidates struggling or gone, Gingrich surged in the polls. On ABC News, Gingrich proclaimed: \"I'm going to be the nominee. It's very hard not to look at the recent polls and think that the odds are very high I'm going to be the nominee.\" Gingrich ran against big government and went on the attack. One of his favorite lines was calling President Obama a \"food stamp president.\" Gingrich told audiences: \"I would like to be the most successful paycheck president in history.\" Many people thought Gingrich was using code language to talk about the first African-American president. Others said it was the recession that led to a record number of people using food stamps. Another controversial Gingrich idea: reforming labor laws so children in poor communities could work. Gingrich said kids could get experience as janitors in their schools. \"Really poor children in really poor neighborhoods have no habits of working and have nobody around them who works,\" Gingrich said during a campaign stop in Iowa. \"They have no habit of showing up on Monday. They have no habit of staying all day. They have no habit of, 'I do this and you give me cash,' unless it's illegal.\" After big losses in Iowa and New Hampshire in January, and questions about Gingrich's character, including extramarital affairs, he won big in South Carolina on Jan. 21. That victory came after an attack on Romney's business career as head of Bain Capital. Gingrich was assisted by Winning Our Future, a superPAC supporting him that produced a 28-minute video called \"King of Bain: When Mitt Romney Came To Town.\" It includes this claim: \"For tens of thousands of Americans, the suffering began ... when Mitt Romney came to town.\" Many suggest it was the superPAC and millions contributed by casino owner Sheldon Adelson and his wife, Miriam \u2014 $20 million, in all \u2014 that kept Gingrich in the race. But Romney and the superPAC supporting him spent millions attacking Gingrich in Florida, and it was Romney who won that state. After a string of losses, Gingrich savored a victory in his home state of Georgia on Super Tuesday, March 6. He embarked on a Southern strategy, citing a pledge to bring gas prices back to $2.50 a gallon. But Gingrich came in second to former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum in both Mississippi and Alabama on March 13. Santorum suspended his campaign on April 10, while Gingrich insisted on staying in the race. Just Tuesday, at the Billy Graham Library in Charlotte, N.C., Gingrich said it was too early to call it quits. \"Gov. Romney is not the nominee at this point,\" said Gingrich. \"He does not have a majority of the delegates, and I think it's a little bit presumptuous. There's a big difference between being the front-runner and being inevitable.\" But after Gingrich lost all five primary battles on Tuesday, he was rethinking his campaign. \"A lot of Republican activists have thought that he should have gotten out a long time ago,\" said Merle Black, a political science professor at Emory University in Atlanta. He said Gingrich's attacks on Romney and his insistence on remaining in the race as long as he did may have hurt Gingrich's prospects for a future role in the party. \"I think his stock is a little bit lower than when he started,\" said Black. \"He's got to put his financial life back together. He's got to put his business life back together. He's got to do all that, and the question is how much credibility will he have in the future. \" After months of attacks on Romney, Gingrich is now calling on the Republican Party to unite behind the former Massachusetts governor.",

Jason Altmire, D-Pa. To get elected in southwestern Pennsylvania as a Democrat, it helps to be a conservative one. And because of congressional reapportionment, two conservative Democratic incumbents are facing off for a single seat in their party's primary later this month. Rep. Jason Altmire and Rep. Mark Critz, who are vying for the state's 12th District seat, each oppose abortion rights and favor gun rights. Their race on April 24 may come down to the few issues that do distinguish the two congressmen. Pennsylvania is one of the states losing a seat in Congress because of reapportionment. Republicans controlled the redrawing of the congressional district maps and decided to lump two Democratic incumbents into the same district. That leaves Democrats in Pennsylvania's 12th Congressional District with a tough choice. Altmire is perhaps the more polished of the two candidates. His 4th District, where he has been elected three times, has been the northern suburbs surrounding Pittsburgh. As he points out, the newly drawn 12th District contains many of the voters he's represented for the past six years. \"I think the fact that I represent two-thirds of the people that live in the combined district \u2014 they know me, they know my record \u2014 that's going to give me the advantage in getting to meet voters and have them understand what I'm all about,\" said Altmire, who met Wednesday with seniors at a community center in Plum, Pa. The senior center has had some recent renovations, thanks to a $300,000 federal grant Altmire helped secure. The seniors' big concerns are, not surprisingly, Medicare and Social Security, programs that Altmire, a former health care executive, pledges he will continue to protect. \"That's one of the reasons that I support a balanced budget,\" Altmire said, speaking at the senior center. \"Every family, every business in America has to balance their own budget. It's overwhelmingly popular because it's simple \u2014 and only in Washington would you hear people saying that balancing the budget is gonna hurt our economy.\" Retired veteran Jeff Pope makes clear he's with Altmire all the way. \"There's no comparison between him and Mark Critz,\" said Pope. \"I've been in his corner from Day 1. He does more for the military man and the military veteran than any other congressman we have. So he will always have my vote.\" In a TV ad, Altmire concedes he and Critz share some common ground but adds that there are some \"big differences,\" as well. Mark Critz in 2010, while campaigning in Washington, Pa., during a special election to fill the seat vacated after the death of his former boss, Rep. John Murtha.\n                \n                    \n                    Gene J. Puskar/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Mark Critz in 2010, while campaigning in Washington, Pa., during a special election to fill the seat vacated after the death of his former boss, Rep. John Murtha. He says that Critz \"voted with the Republicans against reforming Wall Street and ... didn't vote against the Tea Party budget that would dismantle Medicare and gut Social Security.\" Critz has responded with his own ad, attacking Altmire's support for the balanced-budget amendment, saying it would hurt rather than help seniors. Critz is the successor to his former boss, the late Democratic Rep. John Murtha, who brought countless federal projects and contracts to his Johnstown-based district. His name can be found on everything from the John P. Murtha Neuroscience and Pain Institute to the regional airport. But much of that district is now gone, and Critz must introduce himself to new voters. At a campaign appearance at the East Hills Senior Center in Johnstown, he signed a big mock-up of a Social Security card, pledging to \"stand firm and strong to make sure that Social Security and Medicare\" are never used as bargaining chips in budget negotiations. The endorsement Critz won Thursday from former President Bill Clinton may be a key to the race. \"If you want to send a Democrat into southwestern Pennsylvania to stand up for you, to give you an endorsement, it would certainly be Bill Clinton, who is very popular in that part of Pennsylvania,\" said Terry Madonna, a political scientist at Franklin & Marshall College. The race is likely to hinge on whether Critz's endorsements and his get-out-the-vote effort can overcome Altmire's geographical advantage. This much is certain: There will be one fewer conservative Democrat in the already polarized Congress next year.",

The scandal involving the General Services Administration's by now infamous conference featuring spending on a clown and mind reader is certainly far from the biggest in terms of the overall dollars involved. After all, we're talking about less than $1 million all told. That's pocket change at the Pentagon, where they can probably find more taxpayer money under the couch cushions. But it may go down in history as one of the dumbest. A clown and a mind reader at a conference of federal bureaucrats? Really? And it's not like the officials who signed off on the conference held in 2010 at a resort outside Las Vegas weren't warned that they were in dangerous territory. The harsh report issued Monday by the agency's inspector general says some employees told their higher-ups they might want to reconsider: \"(A GSA manager) instructed those planning the conference to make it 'over the top,' bigger and better than previous conferences. Several suggestions by regional employees that costs be reined in were ignored.\" The report is fairly damning. The GSA, an agency responsible for managing government office leases and properties, clearly failed spectacularly on the management front. Besides paying for the clown and mind reader, GSA employees spent $130,000 to visit hotels, including the M Resort Spa-Casino outside Las Vegas where the conference was held, to plan the meeting. Agency employees didn't even bother to follow standard government procurement rules. In a contracting no-no, for instance, someone at GSA gave a preferred contractor details of a competitor's bid. GSA even provided people working for a contractor with complimentary rooms when the contract included money for the contractor to pay for its own hotel rooms. In essence, taxpayers paid twice. The report really is must reading to get the fullest understanding of what happened. It's a case study for federal officials of how not to plan a conference. Taxpayers won't be amused, especially not this close to Tax Day. It's unclear what hand, if any Martha Johnson, the former head of the General Services Administration who \"resigned\" Monday amid the fallout may have had in the conference. She, along with two other top officials, are no longer with the GSA while several other officials have been placed on leave pending further disciplinary action, according to reports. It likely would have been difficult for Johnson to stay on, however, if that was even an option. Upon taking the post in February 2010, she had made it clear that her goal was good government. An excerpt from a Tuesday Washington Post story: During a February 2010 interview, Johnson said she intended to run the agency as ethically as possible after years of scandal during the Bush administration. Ethics \"is a big issue for me,\" she said at the time, adding that \"it's right and it's good business\" to be a \"responsible steward of taxpayer dollars\" because \"they're trusting you with their pocketbooks.\" Such assertions would have made it awkward, to say the least, for her to remain. And the fact that President Obama is seeking re-election made it virtually impossible for her and the other officials to stay on. Johnson is no stranger to Washington. During the Clinton administration, she served in both the Commerce Department as an assistant deputy secretary and at the GSA, where she was chief of staff. She also was in the private sector, working as an executive headhunter, finding talent for ice-cream maker Ben and Jerry's, among others, and a consultant. In her last job before joining the administration she was vice president of \"culture\" at Computer Sciences Corp., a large government contractor of IT services. After Obama's election, she joined his transition team. The Center for Responsive Politics has her in its \"revolving door\" database. The problem for the Obama administration and campaign is obvious. Expect to see mentions of clowns and Las Vegas in Republican campaign ads between now and Election Day. On NPR member station WAMU's Kojo Nnamdi show Tuesday, Donald Kettl, dean of the School of Public Policy at the University of Maryland, said: \"This is just embarrassing by any stretch of the imagination. ... Whether it's the mind reader or the clown or some of the group exercises devoted to trying to figure out how to put a bike together, it's just the kind of thing that is just tailor-made for attack commercials out there. \"It sounds silly, it looks silly and is unquestionably a waste of money. It's at the basic core a problem of making policy in Washington and making sure people out in the field get the word.\" Kettl made the point that the reaction to the GSA scandal could lead to a pernicious development, the government equivalent of cutting off one's nose to spite one's face. In an attempt to prevent such future excesses, cuts could be made to federal agency budgets that actually decrease not improve government's ability to wisely manage its spending. \"The real problem is that we have tens of billions of dollars of Medicare spending that we need to get under control and to do that we require really smart government people who are armed with the right kinds of tools to get the job done. \"And the risk here is that you could end up making everybody inside the government so gun shy that it becomes impossible for them to do what we really need for them to do. \"We don't want to run the risk of, in trying to run a couple hundred thousand dollars of real waste out, ... making it impossible to go after the millions of dollars that we really need to make sure that we recapture.\"",

            "article_content": "In less than three months, we will know the verdict of the U.S. Supreme Court regarding the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, President Obama's signature achievement from 2010. There is no way to predict with any certainty what the court will decide, despite what seemed to be pretty skeptical, if not critical, questions from the justices, especially Anthony Kennedy, considered the court's swing vote. In 2000, Democrats focused on potential Court nominees prior to the election (top button) and resentment over the Bush v. Gore decision in Florida afterwards.\n                \n                    \n                    Ken Rudin Collection\n                    \n                \nhide caption But that hasn't stopped a plethora of \"what if\" scenarios that have made it into print and on the airwaves in the past week. Much of the conjecture has been on what happens if the Court strikes down the bill, either just the individual mandate part or the entire law. Some defenders of the Obama administration see a rejection of the bill as a net plus for the president, claiming that it will invigorate progressives for the fall campaign; others argue that it would be a huge embarrassment for someone who once was a constitutional law professor. One thing that many seem to agree on is that if the law is overturned, Obama would not hesitate to base his campaign not only against a \"do nothing\" Congress, as he's been doing the last few months, but against an ideological Supreme Court. The Court, of course, is always ideological when it rules against your point of view. But the fact is, there seems to be more and more 5-4 decisions lately, reflecting a conservative vs. liberal split, rather than consensus 7-2 or 8-1 rulings. And if the conservatives hold the majority, guess which side is not going to be happy? Going after the Court would not be something new for Obama. During his 2010 State of the Union address, he lashed out at the Court's Citizens United ruling: \"With all due deference to separation of powers, last week the Supreme Court reversed a century of law that, I believe, will open the floodgates for special interests, including foreign corporations, to spend without limit in our elections.\" I'm at pains to remember the last time a president attacked the Supreme Court during a State of the Union speech, especially with members of the Court sitting in the House chamber. The moment was made even more memorable when the cameras caught Justice Samuel Alito shaking his head \"no\" in response to Obama's comments. And if Obama decides to run in this fashion, it would be a pretty unusual tactic for a president to embrace, especially for a Democrat. Jason Zengerle, writing in the March 30 issue of New York magazine, notes, \"Even FDR didn't go negative on the justices during the 1936 presidential campaign, waiting until after he'd won reelection to reveal his plan to pack the bench with his picks.\" Zengerle adds that since the Court's 1954 Brown v. Board of Education decision that desegregated schools, \"the Court has generally been perceived as more liberal than conservative.\" And it's \"tended to be held in lower regard among Republicans than Democrats. And whether it was Richard Nixon in 1968 lambasting the Court for 'hamstringing the peace forces in our society and strengthening the criminal forces' or George W. Bush in 2000 blasting it for having 'usurped legislatures' with its abortion decisions, Republican presidential candidates have attacked the Supremes to rally their base.\" Actually, persuading Democratic voters on this issue may not be hard to do. Conservatives talk endlessly about judicial activism, and we don't have to go back to the 1950s or '60s, when the John Birch Society actively promoted the impeachment of Chief Justice Earl Warren, or to 1970, when then-House Minority Leader Gerald Ford talked about impeaching Associate Justice William O. Douglas. Look no further than this year's GOP primaries and Newt Gingrich's plan to arrest judges to make them justify their controversial rulings. But liberals have come to distrust the Court in recent years as well, especially since the Bush v. Gore ruling in 2000. Both liberals and conservatives have taken up the battle against the Court and its nominees.\n                \n                    \n                    Ken Rudin Collection\n                    \n                \nhide caption And should the Court strike down the healthcare law, their distrust \u2014 and anger \u2014 will likely increase. But let's wait for a decision before we decide what everyone's reaction will be. Political Updates. I post periodic political updates during the week on Twitter. You can follow me at @kenrudin. Meanwhile, time for some readers' questions: Q: Regarding the intro to your Political Junkie segment [on TOTN], can you tell me where each soundbyte comes from? Who and when? \u2014 Janine Collinsworth, Hillsboro, Ore. A: This is what you hear in the opening montage of the Political Junkie segment every Wednesday on NPR: \"There you go again\" \u2014 Former California Gov. Ronald Reagan, responding to President Jimmy Carter's charges on Social Security and Medicare, their one and only debate, Oct. 28, 1980. \"When I hear your new ideas, I'm reminded of that ad: Where's the beef?\" \u2014 Former Vice President Walter Mondale, in his Democratic debate with Sen. Gary Hart of Colorado, March 11, 1984. \"Extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice\" \u2014 Arizona Sen. Barry Goldwater, accepting the Republican presidential nomination, July 16, 1964. \"Senator, you're no Jack Kennedy\" \u2014 Sen. Lloyd Bentsen (D-Texas) to Sen. Dan Quayle (R-Ind.) during their vice presidential debate, Oct. 5, 1988. \"You don't have Nixon to kick around anymore\" \u2014 Former Vice President Richard Nixon, lashing out at the media as he was conceding the California gubernatorial election to incumbent Democrat Pat Brown, Nov. 7, 1962. \"Lipstick\" \u2014 Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, explaining the difference between a hockey mom and a pit bull, accepting the Republican vice presidential nomination, Sept. 3, 2008. \"Oops\" \u2014 Texas Gov. Rick Perry, failing to remember the third government agency he would cut, during a Republican presidential candidate debate, Nov. 9, 2011. \"But I'm the decider\" \u2014 President George W. Bush, saying it's his decision to keep or remove Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and that Rumsfeld is staying, April 18, 2006. \"Yaaaaaah\" (not sure of exact spelling) \u2014 Former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean, talking about how his campaign will go on despite his defeat in the Iowa Democratic caucuses, Jan. 19, 2004. Q: In your column, you say that Reagan \"easily defeated Carter\" in 1980. I believe I'd heard on NPR (possibly from you) that Carter was actually in the lead until Reagan went on television shortly before the election saying essentially, \"If you're not doing so well economically, give me a chance.\" And the polls turned around for him to eventually win. Is that true? I know he won handily, but I thought it wasn't as much of a shoo-in as your column implied. \u2014 Nancy Poole, Cambridge, Mass. A: Everything you say is true. Carter, while trailing Reagan for most of the summer, was rapidly gaining strength in September and October. In fact, the last Gallup Poll taken just prior to their Oct. 28 debate had Carter up 45-42 percent. But their debate basically ended any talk about a second Carter term. Reagan needed to prove he was \"presidential\" \u2014 and not \"dangerous\" or a \"warmonger,\" as the Carter camp tried to portray him. The view of many was that Reagan did what he needed to do, and did so convincingly. His \"there you go again\" line was less of a specific rebuttal to Carter's charges and more to show that he was likeable and not scary. But his closing comments \u2014 \"are you better off than you were four years ago?\" \u2014 signaled the end of the Carter comeback and the beginning of the Reagan surge. One week later, Reagan beat Carter by more than eight million votes and carried 44 of the 50 states. Q: In [the March 26 column], you wrote that the last presidential nominee to lose his previous re-election race was [New York Gov.] Horatio Seymour in 1864. You forgot Benjamin Harrison, who was defeated for re-election as U.S. Senator from Indiana in 1886 and was elected president in 1888. \u2014 Dewie Gaul, Sioux City, Iowa A: You are correct, but there's a little asterisk that needs to be added. Back then, U.S. senators were chosen by their state legislatures. The direct election of senators didn't happen until the adoption of the Seventeenth Amendment to the Constitution in 1913. Harrison was elected by the Republican-controlled Indiana legislature in 1880 but was ousted six years later when the Democrats took over the legislature and denied him a second term. Q: I enjoy your [Talk of the Nation] segment on Wednesday afternoons. I wish it was longer. Anyway, one of the attributes I use in making a decision about who to vote for is military service. If I'm not mistaken, unless Ron Paul gets the Republican nomination, this will be the first time in my voting life that I will not have a choice of a nominee from a major party with military service. I think the last time this happened was 1944 between Franklin D. Roosevelt and Thomas Dewey. \u2014 Frank Allen, Tallahassee, Fla. A: You are right. Of this year's candidates, only Paul and Rick Perry had served in the military. And Paul is not going to be his party's nominee. As for Romney, he missed military service in the 1960s first because of his student deferment and then because of his missionary work. In 1969, when the draft lottery was initiated, he drew number 300; no one above 195 was taken that year. In 1944, FDR, of course, was crippled by polio. I've not been able to ascertain why Dewey never served. Dewey, however, was an aberration for the GOP. Democrats, on the other hand, have had their share of presidential nominees without any military experience \u2014 think Bill Clinton. But Clinton was nonetheless elected twice, each time against a candidate with considerable combat experience: George H.W. Bush and Bob Dole. And there's always time for fan mail: Tilly Gokbudak of Roanoke, Va.: \"As a political junkie myself, I love your hindsight. I want to share this story. Yesterday [Wednesday] I thought I had left my wallet at a gas station near Martinsville, Va. I was an hour away when I realized it and had to drive back to the station. As it turned out, my wallet was under my seat belt the whole time. But it gave me the opportunity to hear your entire Junkie segment and as always I really enjoyed it.\" Dave Atkinson: \"I enjoy your spot on TOTN every Wednesday and make it a point to listen online over here in Baghdad. Regarding your comment on the most recent show about your occasional fear of not being able to come up with a weekly political question, here's one you can keep in your pocket for emergency use. You'll have to formulate the question, but the answer is Lacey Davenport!\" Amy O'Hara of Tampa, Fla.: \"I very much enjoyed listening to your skepticism (which I share) about the tactics and aims of that guy from the Campaign for Primary Accountability. If we are all disturbed by the amount of money in politics, the thought of yet another Super PAC, financed by some Texas millionaires, is ridiculous. Thanks for pointing out how ludicrous this group is.\" Xander Almeida of Portland, Ore.: \"First off... I LOVE POLITICAL JUNKIE. There is only one radio show in the whole world I will never miss an episode of, and it's Talk of the Nation with the Political Junkie.\" Todd Harper of Kennesaw, Ga.: \"I really enjoy your show and look forward to it every week. You'll be interested to know that last week, Nancy Kassebaum was staying with my parents in Kansas City. (My father was her former state administrative assistant.) I was able to pass along the fact that she had been the answer to the previous week's trivia question.\" Christa Foster Crawford of Valencia, Calif.: \"I wish that your show was on more often \u2014 it's my favorite thing to drive to. If I get home before it's over I sit in my car in the driveway looking like a fool until it finishes. Thanks for keeping me up to date!\" This last one, from H. Jochen Bussmann of Berlin, Germany, is for the most part fan mail: \"The capacity of your memory is truly amazing. But your listeners could profit so much more from your immense knowledge and judgment if you would not waste most of your much too scarce radio-time with discussing week after week a question nobody cares to know the answer.

Paul Ryan, a Republican from Wisconsin. Politico reports: \"The 228-191 vote gives the embattled GOP leadership what it most wanted: a show of party unity behind a bold election-year vision that includes new private options for Medicare and a simplified tax code. \"But the price paid by Congress is big: wrecking havoc with hard-fought bargains under the Budget Control Act and inviting another shutdown fight with Senate Democrats and Obama unless the House again reverses course.\" As the AP reads the budget, it sets up a sharp contrast with how President Obama and the Democrats would deal with the deficit, because it slices funding for \"everything from food stamps to transportation and rejects Obama's call for higher taxes on the rich.\" The budget is not expected to be adopted by the Senate. Update at 3:54 p.m. ET. A Bit More On The Budget: If you need a primer on Ryan's latest budget \u2014 he proposed a blueprint last year \u2014 a post Mark wrote earlier this month provides some highlights. One of the notable differences is that this plan allows seniors to choose between government health coverage and private insurance. Ryan's previous plan, which was attacked from all sides, proposed turning Medicare into a voucher program. As Mark reported, the left has already jumped on the plan. He reports: \"Roger Hickey of the Campaign for America's Future calls it a 'suicide pact ... that ignores the clear views of the majority of Americans.'\"",

We probably won't know until June what the Supreme Court justices will decide regarding the health overhaul law known as Obamacare. The questions this week from the conservative majority seemed skeptical of the \"individual mandate\" at the center of the law, yet dubious of the law's survival without it. (A line of questioning may not be a perfect guide to a justice's thinking, but right now it appears to be the way to bet.) So let's say it's June and the high court has laid low the whole law. That's terrible news for President Obama and the Democrats, right? Well, yes and no. Yes, because it's obviously a bummer to have a law that has your name stuck to it struck down by the Supreme Court as unconstitutional. It may be particularly stinging if you once made your living as a constitutional law professor and consider this law your signature achievement. And if you happen to be running for re-election. So the immediate reaction to the total trashing of the law is likely to be gleeful for the right and brutal for the administration. Imagine, too, the pain of Democrats who voted for the law in 2009 and 2010 and are now former members of Congress, at least partly as a consequence. But in the longer run, there are ways in which the striking down of the law could help the president and his party. First, it would eliminate an issue that Republicans have rallied around since early 2009, a fundamental element of the Tea Party movement and a focal point for GOP candidates in 2012. Even Mitt Romney, father of a similar law in Massachusetts, has denounced Obamacare and insisted on its repeal. Second, and conversely, a major hit from the high court could create a bounce-back issue for outraged Democrats in 2012 and beyond. The Democrats have done well in recent decades when they could run on popular disaffection regarding health care, particularly in 1992 and 2008. A chance to rally against the tyranny of the court, striking down popular provisions as well as unpopular, could be potent. Consider how much ground the GOP gained running against the liberal court of Chief Justice Earl Warren a generation ago, or against the Roe v. Wade abortion decision since 1973. It is increasingly easy to convince average Americans that the court itself is politicized, when all five Republican appointees regularly vote against all four Democratic appointees in high-visibility cases. Third, and most significantly, striking down this law will narrow the scope of debate about health care and its costs in the future. It means we are going back to debating the status quo versus a national health care system. The courtroom conversation this week strongly suggested that if the government wants to do something about the uninsured, it ought to have a benefit program and pay for it with taxes. None of the justices came out and said as much, but they made it clear such an arrangement would be as constitutional as Social Security or Medicare. This guarantees that when the health care debate returns, the idea of universal coverage through a hybrid private insurance system co-existing with government programs will be dead. We should note here that the idea of such a hybrid was originally a Republican idea, going back more than a decade. It was regarded as the best way to forestall \"socialized medicine,\" or a \"single payer\" scheme run by Washington. And it had promise: Romney's own version in Massachusetts has been successful and relatively popular, even with its insurance requirement. But the Supreme Court seems about to outlaw such a compromise at the federal level. And if so, it means the next big round of policy debate will be about a national health care plan (think Canada or Europe) replacing a world where insurance costs and the number of uninsured are rising apace. In Texas, it's already one person in four. That will mean more uninsured patients winding up with unpaid bills borne by hospitals and other providers, who load the costs back onto the rest of us \u2014 just like now. No Congress in the near future is likely to adopt a single payer plan. So what seems likeliest is a gradual process by which the age of Medicare eligibility moves down, the age of SCHIP coverage eligibility for children rises, and access to Medicaid is widened to include more income groups. Some call it \"Medicare for All,\" and it is one way to bring \"single payer\" health care to America. That is why, in the long run, what we have seen in the past three years will not be remembered so much as a battle between liberals and conservatives as a battle between two kinds of conservatives: the pragmatic versus the pure. Obamacare may have become anathema to all Republicans, but the ideas at its heart were meant to be a moderate, practical answer to the pressure for more government involvement. The pure conservatives in Congress preferred full resistance to any further encroachment, and that view appeared to hold sway with the high court, as well. The public-private hybrid was a compromise the Obama people proved willing to accept in 2009, when many Democrats preferred single payer or at least a \"public option\" that made a government plan available to those unable to obtain or afford private insurance. It was part of the White House strategy to lure GOP senators such as Charles Grassley to support the bill. It failed, and the Democrats had to pass the bill themselves and become the party of the \"individual mandate.\" And by the way, did anyone ever try to defend a less lovely phrase in a political arena? In our national culture, we identify with the individual and against the outside power that mandates something. To be sure, the phrase was a leftover from earlier policy debates. But it should have been deep-sixed early in 2009 if the White House hoped to make its approach popular and attractive. Why not call it \"universal participation\" or \"individual responsibility\"? Why not make it something to be proud of rather than a whiff of Big Brother?",

Paul Ryan's budget plan. \n                \n                    \n                    Steven Senne/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney speaks in San Diego on Monday. Democrats have criticized his support for GOP Rep. Paul Ryan's budget plan. The U.S. House of Representatives is scheduled to vote Thursday on what's known as the Ryan budget, the spending plan from Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, R-Wis., that among other things changes the structure of Medicare and rewrites the tax code. Presidential candidate Mitt Romney has endorsed the plan, but some are saying his rhetoric on the campaign trail may not match up with at least one reality of the Ryan budget. Romney said he supported the Ryan budget the day it was unveiled. \"I applaud it,\" he said. \"It's an excellent piece of work, and very much needed.\" Rep. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., a member of the budget committee, says Romney's praise is a contradiction. \"Mitt Romney and the Republicans are trying to have it both ways,\" he says. Cut Vs. Savings What they're trying to have, he says, is $500 billion in projected Medicare savings. Those savings are part of the Affordable Care Act, President Obama's health care law. They're achieved through slower payments to hospitals and a reduction in the overpayment of premiums to Medicare Advantage providers. Those savings are something Romney hits President Obama on day after day on the campaign trail. \"There's only one president in history who's cut $500 billion out of Medicare, and that's your guy, Barack Obama,\" Romney said recently. \"And if I'm president, I'm going to preserve Medicare. I'm not going to cut $500 billion out of the Medicare that we have.\" But here's the rub: The Ryan budget assumes that very same $500 billion cut. Well, \"cut\" isn't the right word; \"savings\" is more accurate. The reality is that in real dollars, Medicare spending will keep rising \u2014 just not by as much. \"Their budget \u2014 the Romney-Ryan budget \u2014 takes all of those savings that they complained about,\" Van Hollen says. Difference Between Plans Those savings are baked in to the Ryan budget. \"It's more of an accounting process that occurs,\" says Rep. Tom Price, R-Ga., also a member of the budget committee. He says there's a big difference between what the Affordable Care Act does with the savings and what the Republican budget would do with that $500 billion. Price says the health care law uses the savings to pay for other parts of the Affordable Care Act, but the Ryan budget repeals most of the health care law. Compared to current law, including the changes in the Affordable Care Act, by 2050 the Republican budget would actually lower per-person spending in Medicare by about 35 percent, above and beyond what we already have in current law. Jon Oberlander, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill \"We believe that money ought to stay in the program so that we \u2014 what we call \u2014 grandfather the grandfathers,\" Price says. \"The program doesn't change for anybody in or near retirement.\" In the future, the GOP budget would have seniors choose between traditional Medicare and private plans, and they'd get vouchers to help pay for their coverage. Democrats and advocates for seniors argue this would ultimately hurt Medicare, and cost seniors more out of pocket. Jon Oberlander, a professor of health policy at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, says based on estimates from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the reductions in government spending on Medicare would be significant. \"Compared to current law, including the changes in the Affordable Care Act, by 2050 the Republican budget would actually lower per-person spending in Medicare by about 35 percent, above and beyond what we already have in current law.\" The Romney campaign did not get back to NPR with a comment, though the former Massachusetts governor previously praised the Ryan budget for addressing long-term Medicare costs.",

Democrats lost no time in attacking the budget plan House Republicans introduced Tuesday. The plan saves money by overhauling Medicare, but Democrats argue it will destroy the program. One of the Democrats leading the charge is Vice President Joe Biden. Taking on the role of candidate, Biden was in Coconut Creek, Fla., giving the second in what he promises will be a series of campaign speeches challenging the Republicans. There are few places in Florida more welcoming to Democrats than Wynmoor Village, a large retirement community populated largely by people from the Northeast. Residents say there are a few closet Republicans, but more independents. \"I'm worried about Medicare for our children, not for me,\" one independent, Ron Goldberg, said. \"I'm already there. But will it be there for our kids and our grandkids? That's the problem.\" 'Make No Mistake' That's an idea House Republicans are hoping to capitalize on with their budget. Crafted by Paul Ryan, the House Budget Committee chairman, it seeks to save more than $200 billion from Medicare over the next 10 years by moving future generations into privately run health plans. When Ryan first proposed the idea in last year's budget, it was panned. This year's version has some important changes: Future seniors would have the option of retaining traditional Medicare. Also, because it builds on ideas Ryan developed with Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden, Republicans are able to claim it's bipartisan. But Biden told his audience of seniors not to believe it. \"Make no mistake about it. If the Republicans in Congress, and their amen corner of Romney, Santorum and Gingrich \u2014 if any one of them get ... the keys to the White House \u2014 I promise you, you will see Medicare ended as you know it,\" he said. Biden says there's no question the baby boom generation \u2014 now moving into retirement age \u2014 provides real challenges for Social Security, with the number of seniors doubling by 2040. Biden says faced with those challenges, the nation has a choice. Republicans and Democrats can work together, as they have in the past. \"Or ... are we going to use these challenges as a pretense to do what so many have been trying to do from the beginning: dismantle both of these programs?\" he said. That's a message Democrats expect to take to the general election in November, both in the race for the White House and in congressional campaigns. On Message Even before House Republicans voted to adopt the Ryan budget, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee rolled out a website and started making robocalls targeting 41 vulnerable House Republicans. One of them is a first-term congressman from Orlando, Fla., Daniel Webster. \"I think the detractors from this budget are thinking about the next election,\" he says. \"I think the Republicans in Congress are thinking about the next generation.\" Webster says the Ryan budget, with its Medicare overhaul, is an important step toward a balanced budget. Politico reported Thursday on a briefing given to House Republicans to help them sell the plan to constituents. Call it \"bipartisan,\" they were told, and use phrases like \"fix Medicare and keep it from going bankrupt.\" In describing the Medicare overhaul, Webster stuck to the script. \"It's a bipartisan Medicare proposal that strengthens it and saves it actually from extinction,\" he said. \"And if we don't do something ... it's going to go bankrupt. However, fixing it now is the key.\" Webster is expected to be in a tight race this year. He says the key will be winning over independents. That means reaching people like Wynmoor village resident Arlene Grossman, an independent. \"Of course he said what the seniors want to hear,\" she said after Biden spoke. \"But I think it's true. And the other side does not care as much about the seniors ... because they are \u2014 represent wealthy Americans.\" It's a message right out of the Obama-Biden playbook.",

            "article_content": "In Montana, Democratic senator Jon Tester is in a tight battle for reelection. His likely opponent is Congressman Denny Rehberg. And it's also likely that millions of dollars will be spent on the race, as Tester and Rehberg have failed to forge an agreement barring outside money.  AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: Republican hopes of reclaiming the Senate this year may hinge on just a handful of states. As NPR's Martin Kaste reports, one of the most competitive races is in Montana. MARTIN KASTE, BYLINE: Six years ago, Democrat Jon Tester squeaked into a U.S. Senate seat from Montana by riding wave of mid-term discontent with a Republican president, and by emphasizing his own image as a dirt farmer with a crew cut. SENATOR JON TESTER: How's everybody here? UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Great, you betcha. TESTER: Yah, you betcha. KASTE: He's still working the folksy angle. Here's Tester last week at the state capitol, with his grandson on his arm. (SOUNDBITE OF BABY) TESTER: Say hi, guy. KASTE: But this time around, Tester is saddled by a sputtering economy and a less-than-popular Democratic president. And on top of all that, he's already getting slammed by TV ads. TESTER: That's probably the biggest difference. They started running ads against me before the last election was over in 2010, and they aren't being necessarily truthful at all. (SOUNDBITE OF A POLITICAL AD) UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Is the solution more government interference? More taxes? That's the Washington way. Sadly, it's become Jon Tester's way, too. KASTE: That ad was paid for by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Other conservative groups have also been on the air. Like the rest of the country, Montana is seeing a tide of third party ads this year from both sides. (SOUNDBITE OF A POLITICAL AD) UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: If you cut my Medicare, Congressman Rehberg, I'll remember it every time I visit my doctor. I'll remember you cutting... KASTE: This union-funded ad targets the Republican challenger, Denny Rehberg, Montana's sole member of the House of Representatives. (SOUNDBITE OF A POLITICAL AD) UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: I'll remember you protected millionaires over protecting my health. KASTE: Montana State University political science professor David Parker estimates that these groups have already spent two to $3 million worth of ads. In Montana, that's a lot of money. PROFESSOR DAVID PARKER: To buy statewide media for the entire state of Montana for about 10 days is about $85,000 to cover the whole state. KASTE: So for the national groups trying to sway control of the Senate, Montana is a cheap date. But Parker says those groups should also keep in mind the state's longstanding suspicion of outsiders, whether it be big mining companies or the coastal elites. PARKER: Montana is a little different in this regard. We like to keep the outside at kind of arm's length. KASTE: He points to the 1982 Senate race, when the National Conservative Political Action Committee came in with an ad campaign against Democratic incumbent John Melcher. Melcher turned the tables with an ad featuring talking cattle. (SOUNDBITE OF A POLITICAL AD) UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: Did ya hear about those city slickers out here bad-mouthing Doc Melcher? UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #3: One of them was stepping in what they been trying to sell. KASTE: This year, Tester tried to score similar points by challenging Rehberg to reject all third party spending. Rehberg upped the ante by suggesting both sides also give up all the out-of-state money in their campaign war chests. Since Tester's campaign fund is a lot bigger, there was no deal and it looked as if Rehberg had called Tester's bluff. Still, at the recent Lincoln-Reagan Dinner in Butte, Rehberg didn't want to talk about money. REPRESENTATIVE DENNY REHBERG: While people want to divert to issues like campaign finance \u2013 and it's kind of a sexy issue \u2013 it's not the issue of the day. KASTE: Rehberg is more focused on painting Tester as a pro-Obama liberal. For him, this race will pivot on the same question that was central in 2010. REHBERG: Do you believe that the economy can be saved by government intervention? Or do you believe that government should be limited and in many cases, they're the problem? KASTE: Because Rehberg is Montana's at-large congressman, representing the whole state, voters know both men equally well. And that's why Republican Sabrina Holland says she's not too worried about all the outside spending. SABRINA HOLLAND: As much money as you pour in, I don't think it'll make a great deal of difference. I think most Montanans have been decided for a very long time whether they support Jon Tester or Denny Rehberg. KASTE: Actually, Montana voters seem to support both men. In 2006, they elected Tester and Rehberg at the same time. But there's no having it both ways this year, and a lot of money is going to be spent helping Montanans to make up their minds.

            "article_content": "Former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney delivered an economic address at Ford Field, home of the Detroit Lions, on Friday in advance of the state's primary on Tuesday.  AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Audie Cornish. MELISSA BLOCK, HOST: And I'm Melissa Block. Mitt Romney delivered what his campaign called a major economic speech today in Detroit. His team has been building up anticipation for weeks. They even moved it from a smaller venue to Ford Field, the football stadium where the Detroit Lions play. NPR's Ari Shapiro was there. ARI SHAPIRO, BYLINE: From the outset, this event was an exercise in managing expectations. It may be a major speech, but Romney warned people that they might not get amped up about it. MITT ROMNEY: This is not exciting and barn burning, but it's important. SHAPIRO: His stage was built on the football field at the 30-yard line. In front of him, 1,200 members of the Detroit Economic Club who'd bought tickets to the event. They sat in folding chairs on the Astroturf, wearing suits and ties. All around them, 65,000 empty seats. Romney's voice boomed and echoed through the arena. ROMNEY: I guess we had a hard time finding a large enough place to meet, and this certainly is. SHAPIRO: He went through his plans to shrink government and lower taxes. He wants to reduce everyone's rates. He says he'll pay for the tax cuts by eliminating unspecified deductions. ROMNEY: These changes, I will not allow to raise the deficit. Stronger economic growth, spending cuts, and broadening the base will offset the reductions. SHAPIRO: For the most part, these are ideas Romney has talked about before. There were a few new proposals, for example, raising the Medicare eligibility age by a month each year, then locking it in to increase with life expectancy. The audience generally responded with polite applause. Charles Stoddard sat in the crowd wearing a Romney pin from the 1968 presidential campaign of Mitt's father, George Romney. CHARLES STODDARD: I've known the family for 50 years. We went to high school together, Cranbrook School in Bloomfield Hills. SHAPIRO: What was he like in school? STODDARD: He wasn't that good as an athlete. He wasn't that good as a scholar, but everybody liked him. He was just an all-around good guy. SHAPIRO: What was he good at? STODDARD: He had great people skills. People liked him. SHAPIRO: Stoddard liked Romney's economic proposals too. STODDARD: Sixteen trillion in debt is just going to kill us if we don't do something about it. SHAPIRO: Do you think it's possible for him to lower taxes for everyone and still keep the debt at the level it's at or shrink it? STODDARD: Yes, because I think the economy will grow and offset the tax cuts. SHAPIRO: Larry Lipton, who describes himself as an independent, was less impressed. LARRY LIPTON: I was not happy because of some of the inconsistencies. SHAPIRO: He thinks it's disingenuous for Romney to talk about defending the guarantee of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. LIPTON: How does he provide all citizens with pursuit of happiness if he's going to cut programs to the very poorest? SHAPIRO: Romney didn't promise to cut programs for the very poorest, but he implied those cuts might be coming. ROMNEY: And I want to extend that conservative small government philosophy across the entire social safety net for those that are in need of our help. SHAPIRO: Romney barely mentioned his rivals in this presidential race until the end. He took three written questions, and the third asked whether he has the best chance of defeating President Obama. ROMNEY: I not only think I have the best chance, I think I have the only chance. Maybe I'm overstating it a bit. (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER) SHAPIRO: He said the only way to defeat President Obama is with someone who has not spent time in Washington. ROMNEY: But Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum, fine fellows, but they've spent their careers in Washington. They have as their background the same background he has. I will have credibility on the economy. SHAPIRO: One way to tell the difference between an average Romney campaign event and a major speech is that the campaign brings out the teleprompters for the major speeches. Today, Romney often strayed from the text on the screen. In closing, he talked extemporaneously about how much he loves Michigan, saying, as he has before, that the trees are the right height, the streets are just right. And then he casually drew attention to his own wealth as he so often has on the campaign trail. ROMNEY: I like the fact that most of the cars I see are Detroit-made automobiles. I drive a Mustang and a Chevy pickup truck. Ann drives a couple of Cadillacs, actually. SHAPIRO: Later, a campaign aide clarified that Ann has two Cadillac SRXs: one in California, one in Massachusetts. It's a luxury crossover SUV. Starting price: $35,000.

President Obama and the DNC raised $29.1 million in January. A few of the political stories worth noting this Friday: Congressional negotiators reached agreement on extensions of the payroll tax cut as well as federal jobless benefits and a \"fix\" that would prevent Medicare reimbursements to doctors from being cut. But while the House's Republican leaders and the Senate's Democratic leaders were on board, Senate Republicansn weren't. Votes are expected in both chambers Friday. President Obama's campaign along with the Democratic National Committee raised $29.1 million in January for the president's re-election efforts. The Obama campaign bragged that more than 98 percent of that came from donors of $250 or less. A new Suffolk University poll out of Massachusetts showed Republican Sen. Scott Brown leading Elizabeth Warren by nine percentage points, 49 percent to 40 percent. Other recent polls had shown Warren with a slight lead but the Suffolk poll suggests Brown may not be as vulnerable as Democrats hoped, especially since 60 percent of those surveyed thought the state benefited from having both a Republican and Democrat in the Senate. The Washington Post reports, as others have before, that in earlier incarnations Mitt Romney was dedicated to chasing federal taxpayer money, an activity he now rails against. Both as head of the 2002 Salt Lake City Winter Olympics and as governor of Massachusetts, he sought federal dollars from Congress, including earmarks. Maine's Republican Party now appears to be conceding it prematurely declared Romney the winner of its Republican presidential caucuses last Saturday. The state's GOP officials plan to include the results from Washington County and are reconfirming results from elsewhere. They declared Romney the victor with just 200 more votes more than Rep. Ron Paul of Texas.",

Scott Applewhite/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Speaker John Boehner didn't cite it being an election year or Congress' low approval ratings for the GOP's new flexibility but it's hard to ignore such realities. Part of President Obama's 2012 re-election strategy was to run against a do-nothing Congress. But congressional Republicans now appear determined to make that approach harder for him by coming to terms on some Democratic priorities. The news that a compromise was reached by congressional Republicans and Democrats to extend the payroll tax cut as well as to fund two other policies \u2014 additional jobless benefits for some of the long-term unemployed and no payment cuts to doctors who accept Medicare patients \u2014 was an indication of how the looming general election has changed the political dynamics in Washington. At a media availability Wednesday, House Speaker John Boehner didn't say directly that there was a new mood of compromise on Capitol Hill. He suggested, instead, that Republicans had chosen to act responsibly because  Democrats allegedly weren't: BOEHNER: So we were not going to allow the Democrats to continue to play political games and raise taxes on working Americans. And so we made a decision to bring them to the table so that the games would stop and we would get this work done. Boehner added that the House could vote on the agreement by week's end. What Boehner didn't say but what is most certainly true is that none of the past year's partisan battles over an earlier extension of the payroll tax cut, raising the debt ceiling or continuing to fund the federal government have left Republicans politically better off. All those fights did was help Congress' approval ratings fall to about 10 percent, give or take a percentage point, while Obama's approval has inched up. Clearly, the prior congressional Republican strategy was creating some electoral vulnerabilities for the GOP. So there was an obvious incentive for the congressional Republican leadership to shift course to avoid incurring anymore of the political damage of the past year. There'll still be plenty of disagreements and other issues on which the president will accuse congressional Republicans of intransigence. Compromise seems next to impossible on Democratic proposals to raise taxes on the wealthy, for instance. And his 2013 budget is just as much of a non-starter as the jobs legislation he proposed last year. But the congressional Republican leaders are clearly becoming more selective on where they draw the line.",

It goes without saying that the men who are vying for the Republican presidential nomination found serious flaws with the budget plan President Obama released Monday. But it got us thinking that this might also be a good time to dig into the budget plans offered by the GOP candidates. All of the candidates want to cut government spending and balance the federal budget.  They also want to cut taxes. Rep. Ron Paul of Texas says he'd shrink the federal government by $1 trillion in his first year as president. \"The main problem we have is the government is too big, and the debt is too big, and you have to cut spending \u2014 so you have to get people to come together,\" Paul said at a Fox News debate in December. \"They have been coming together to increase spending for decades. We have to get them to come together to do the opposite.\" Paul's goal is to eliminate the income tax altogether, which would mean drastic cuts to the government, both domestic and defense. Former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum says he'd commit to cut $5 trillion of federal spending in five years. \"We're going to cut programs,\" said Santorum at a CNN debate in late January. \"We're going to spend \u2014 under my administration, we're going to spend less money every year \u2014 every year. Year to year to year the federal government amount of spending will go down for four years, until we get a balanced budget.\" Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich says he, too, would balance the budget, by boosting the economy, modernizing and streamlining the government, and increasing domestic energy production. At the late January CNN debate, he said: \"My goal is to shrink the government to fit the revenue, not to raise the revenue to catch up with the government.\" And he'd have to do some serious shrinking of the government to get the budget in balance, because according to one independent analysis, Gingrich's tax plan would bring in about $1.3 trillion less each year than under current law. Santorum's tax plan would call for a similar annual reduction in federal revenue, and \u2014 in order to balance the budget \u2014 spending cuts to match. \"Which is very, very difficult to do over a short period of time,\" says Joshua Gordon, policy director for The Concord Coalition, a nonpartisan group devoted to fiscal responsibility. Just to put the task Santorum and Gingrich would face into perspective, Gordon says, think about the congressional supercommittee, which last year failed to agree on $1.2 trillion in deficit reduction, which was to have been spread over a decade. \"This would make you try and do that in just a single year, and then you would have to do it for every successive year as well,\" says Gordon. \"And it really becomes an exercise in impossible math.\" Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney is calling for relatively smaller tax cuts. \"And without raising taxes or sacrificing America's critical military superiority, I will finally balance the American budget,\" Romney said to applause last week at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington. In addition to protecting military spending from cuts, Romney has pledged to more or less leave Social Security alone for the next decade. \"The cuts in non-defensive programs would be huge,\" says Paul Van de Water, with the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. \"Over a half by 2021.\" The center says that cuts in non-defense programs under Romney's plan would be 54 percent, to be precise, according to a recent analysis it conducted. Veterans benefits, Medicare, food stamps, education funding \u2014 you name it \u2014 it would probably have to be cut, says Van de Water. \"I don't see how non-defense cuts of this magnitude could possibly be achieved.\" He's not just talking technically, but also in terms of political reality.  Because any tax cuts or spending cuts would have to pass through Congress.  And as much as members of Congress say they despise deficits, they are also loath to cut programs that keep voters back home happy.",

Nearly one in five Floridians is retired. And a survey conducted by AARP predicts that as many as 60 percent of those who cast ballots in Tuesday's Republican primary \u2014 6 out of 10 voters \u2014 will be retirees. If that number is surprising, AARP Florida director Jeff Johnson says it helps to remember that primaries typically have a low turnout. \"When you think about who votes in primaries, they tend to be the most dedicated, loyal voters \u2014 the people who vote in every election,\" Johnson says. \"And for years, politicians and political operatives have known that the older you are, the more likely you are to be one of those regular voters.\" In Pensacola this weekend, retiree Catherine Murphy went to a rally for her candidate, Mitt Romney. The most important issue for her: the economy. \"[There are] too many people who don't have the income from their work \u2014 my own son, for one,\" she says.

Murphy says her son, the father of two young children, is unable to work after having contracted Lyme disease. Florida is struggling with unemployment higher than the national average and a still dismal housing market, with hundreds of thousands of homeowners facing foreclosure. University of South Florida political scientist Susan MacManus says retirees in the Sunshine State tend to be a little wealthier than retirees elsewhere. But this economic downturn, she says, has had a big impact on Florida's senior citizens. \"They're terribly worried about the economic future of their children and grandchildren,\" MacManus says, \"because many retirees in Florida have had to step up to the plate and help their adult children make their house notes or help them send their kids to college.\" In surveys and interviews she conducted with groups of senior voters in Florida, MacManus says she finds many are also worried about the nation's debt. \"They're also very likely to say, 'Let's reduce the deficit.  But, by the way, let's not mess too much with Medicare and Social Security,' \" she says. Retiree Catherine Murphy says changes might be needed to strengthen Medicare and Social Security, but she's leery about the possibility of cuts. \"I'm one of those old citizens, but people are depending on that,\" she says. \"They could reduce in other areas ... [but] this is a necessary expenditure.\" Both former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich support making reforms to Medicare.  Both propose giving the elderly the option to stay in traditional Medicare or move into private insurance plans. Gingrich has also talked about giving younger workers the choice of opting out of Social Security and setting up 401(k)-type retirement accounts.  Romney would try to strengthen Social Security by raising the retirement age and slowing the growth in benefits for wealthier retirees. But you haven't heard much about those proposals as the candidates campaigned over the past week in Florida.  Moderators didn't bring them up in the two debates, and Jeff Johnson of AARP says the candidates don't raise them because they're worried whatever they say could be used against them in the primary or general election. \"It is a perilous course for them to raise these issues,\" Johnson says. The reality, he says, is that whoever is elected president will have to deal with the issues of Social Security and Medicare and their long-term future. \"To not know before the election what the candidates think of those issues is really troubling.\" Romney and Gingrich \u2014 the two Republican front-runners \u2014 have campaigned in The Villages, a central Florida community that is home to nearly 80,000 retirees. At the government center there a few days ago, Dana Carter cast his ballot in early voting for former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum. He says he also is concerned about the future of both Medicare and Social Security, not for himself, but for the next generation. \"I worry about the people who are coming up behind us,\" Carter says, \"because, unless [politicians] can change something, unless they stop stealing from the Social Security trust fund, there won't be anything for those younger people.\" The message from Florida retirees: Fix Social Security and Medicare, but do it without making cuts to programs many here depend on.",

In the race for the Republican presidential nomination, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich continues to fend off accusations that he should wear the scarlet \"L\" \u2014 for \"lobbyist.\" This week, he released two of his consulting contracts and said they didn't call for any lobbying. Like many other former lawmakers, Gingrich was advocating for paying clients, while not officially registering as a lobbyist. The two contracts disclosed this week came from Gingrich's work for Freddie Mac, the mortgage giant. Between 1999 and 2007, Freddie Mac paid his firm $1.6 million. The contracts say he was advising and discussing, not lobbying \u2014 at least not in the legal sense of the word. \"There is no place in the contract that provides for lobbying. I have never done any lobbying,\" Gingrich said at a debate Monday night. Gingrich deliberately avoided registering as a lobbyist, which would make public his clients and their payments to him. There is no place in the contract that provides for lobbying. I have never done any lobbying. Newt Gingrich \"In fact, we brought in an expert on lobbying law and trained all of our staff. And that expert is prepared to testify that he was brought in to say, 'Here is the bright line,' \" Gingrich said. That expert is Thomas Susman, now the head lobbyist for the American Bar Association. He says his work for Gingrich is no secret. \"He said that I could go public with my representation back when I first worked for him,\" Susman says. But Susman's version doesn't quite match Gingrich's. He's sure he gave Gingrich some advice about the federal lobbying law, but not enough  that he remembers doing so. \"I'm sure I would have, because that was what my expertise and involvement had been,\" he says. Besides, that really wasn't Gingrich's focus. \"He was involved with a number of clients of his group at the state level, with state legislators and state officials. And that was where he was most concerned,\" Susman says. Promoting Part D Gingrich is also defending his advocacy of the Medicare drug benefit known as Part D. On Thursday, rival Mitt Romney's campaign brought out former New Hampshire Republican Rep. Jeb Bradley, who told reporters about a meeting with Gingrich before the congressional vote on Part D in 2003. \"I'll tell you, that day that I met with Newt, he was lobbying,\" Bradley said. Gingrich says he promoted Part D as a citizen, not a paid lobbyist. He cited the need for better diabetes treatment as an example at Monday night's debate. \"I publicly favored Medicare Part D for a practical reason. And that reason is simple: The U.S. government was not prepared to give people anything \u2014 insulin, for example \u2014 but they would pay for kidney dialysis,\" he said. But while Gingrich long supported the drug benefit, it's also true that Novo Nordisk, a company that specializes in diabetes treatment, was a $200,000-a-year member of his Center for Health Transformation. Lobbyist Loathing This stance of \"do no lobbying\" has defined Gingrich's post-Congress career. If he wants to be the first president who's a registered lobbyist, we'd love it. Howard Marlowe, president of the American League of Lobbyists The assertion shows up on the website of the Center for Health Transformation and in one of the Freddie Mac contracts. But lobbyists rarely use the L word in their contracts. Susman remembers the so-called engagement letters used by his old law firm. \"We'd use such terms as advocacy, including advice and counsel, including organizing. But probably not use the word lobbying in it,\" he says. Susman is active in a push to make the lobbying industry more transparent. So is political scientist James Thurber, who heads up an institute on lobbying at American University. Thurber says there should be disclosure by so-called senior advisers \u2014 the former lawmakers, like Gingrich, who don't formally register as lobbyists. \"They don't have to be called lobbyists, but let's find out who they are,\" Thurber says. And even some lobbyists want more transparency for their industry. An association called the American League of Lobbyists is working on a reform proposal. The league's president, Howard Marlowe, says he wishes Gingrich wouldn't run away from the profession. \"If he wants to be the first president who's a registered lobbyist, we'd love it,\" Marlowe says. But for now, Gingrich and other politicians seem pretty sure that a registered lobbyist is about the last candidate voters would want.",

            "article_content": "Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney paid about $3 million in federal income taxes in 2010. Romney's tax returns show most of his $21.7 million income came from his investments. The former Mass. governor has been under pressure in recent weeks to release his tax returns. Some media organizations received an advanced copy of the candidate's return.  DAVID GREENE, HOST: All right, so Romney has gone on the attack in Florida, and he'll also be answering a lot of questions today about those taxes that he is releasing. As we heard from Mara, it turns out over the last few years, the effective tax rate Romney has paid is just under 15 percent. Now, Newt Gingrich has been pressing Romney to publicly disclose the documents. And the former House speaker released his own tax returns, to dramatic effect, during a debate last Thursday. NPR's Tamara Keith has the calculator out, and she's been working it all night. And she joins us to break down the numbers. Tamara, good morning. TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Good morning. GREENE: All right. Let's start with these basic numbers for Mitt Romney that will make news today. How much did he pay in taxes? KEITH: I should start by saying that the campaign has not yet posted his taxes online. They gave a sneak peak to a handful of publications, and so we're working with their numbers.  And a warning - there are a lot of numbers here. GREENE: Consider us warned; we'll bear with you. KEITH: OK. So in 2010, Romney had just about $22 million in income, and he paid about 3 million in taxes. And then in his estimates for 2011, his income would be 21 million, and is expected to pay 3.2 million in taxes. Average all those things out, and you get an effective tax rate of about 14 and a half percent, which is quite low. The average tax rate paid by people earning more than a million dollars a year is 25 percent. That's according to the Tax Foundation. So Romney is paying much lower taxes than the average very wealthy person. Also a note: He gave $7 million to charity over those two years. And much of that went to the Mormon Church, where he tithes 10 percent of his income. GREENE: OK. So Romney paying less in taxes than even most other people who are rich. But what about Newt Gingrich? KEITH: He released his 2010 returns, and he said that he paid nearly a million dollars on an adjusted gross income of 3.1 million. That works out to just over 30 percent. GREENE: Well, let's make sure we understand this, because it is a lot of numbers. So Romney's paying an effective tax rate that's like, about half of what Gingrich is paying, I think. How does that happen? KEITH: Well, it all comes down to earned income versus unearned income. And much of Gingrich's income came either through wages - or he has some S-corporations that pass income through to him. And much of that was taxed at the top individual tax rate, which is 35 percent. Almost all of Romney's money came through capital gain - so returns on investment, dividends, interest. He amassed huge personal wealth when he worked at Bain Capital. And now, that money is basically generating more money. And when that happens, it's taxed at the capital gains rate, which is 15 percent. Here's a little bit more from the debate last night, with Romney talking about his taxes. (SOUNDBITE OF DEBATE) GREENE: Proud of paying a lot of taxes. KEITH: Yeah. So what we've learned so far is that Romney pays a lot of taxes because he is extremely wealthy - which is something that we knew already. GREENE: Well, help us better understand these numbers compared to what most Americans pay in taxes. KEITH: The average effective tax rate in America is 11 percent - that's according to the Tax Foundation. But then the average American also pays payroll taxes for Social Security and Medicare, and that pushes most people above 15 percent. GREENE: You know, Tamara, Romney had been so reluctant to release these returns. How is this likely to affect things on the campaign trail? KEITH: Well, last week in South Carolina, Romney said that he thought he paid about a 15 percent effective tax rate. And immediately, Newt Gingrich started going after him, in sort of a backhanded way. Gingrich has a tax plan, and it has a 15 percent flat tax option. Here he is, talking about that at last night's debate. (SOUNDBITE OF DEBATE) GREENE: Gingrich is going to try to use Romney's taxes for his own purposes. KEITH: Yeah, he gets to remind everyone that Romney is paying a fairly low tax rate, which could really annoy voters who either pay a lot more or at least, think they do. One note: Under the Gingrich tax plan, Romney would actually pay an effective tax rate of near-zero, because Gingrich proposes eliminating all taxes on capital gains. President Obama and his Democratic allies are not going to want to let this issue go, either. The president has been calling for a surtax on millionaires. He's also been talking about the so-called Buffett rule. And in a race that is likely to include discussions of income inequality, Romney's tax rate plays right into the president's hands. GREENE: All right. Well, Tamara, don't put the calculator away quite yet. KEITH: Oh, no. GREENE: NPR's Tamara Keith. Thank you. KEITH: You're welcome. Copyright \u00a9 2012 NPR.

On Morning Edition Monday, Steve Inskeep speaks with six women in Derry, N.H., who all plan to vote in Tuesday's first presidential primary. Inskeep dropped by the home of Elaine Sweeney, where the women gathered for coffee, doughnuts and wine on Sunday to talk politics. Her house in Derry overlooks Beaver Lake, covered this time of year with a thin film of ice. Several of the women have been attending debate parties and candidate events. Linda Dupere has repeatedly attended protest rallies. \"I'm a Tea Partyer,\" she said. \"We want to see elected officials who are going to get in there and change big government.\" All the women felt some connection to the issues dominating this election. Samantha Boudreau is 21 years old, and studying to be a pharmacist. \"Job creation is a big issue, and in New Hampshire I think we've been doing pretty well in the past few months creating jobs, but being a student, I will be graduating next May, and I'm going to have significant student loans to pay off, so getting a job is very important,\" said Boudreau, who said she'll owe over $140,000 when she graduates. The women range from students to retirees, and it was easy to hear the high expectations they'll have for whoever wins this election. They want to cut back federal spending, but at the same time, several collect Social Security and Medicare, and they don't want future generations to live worse than they did. Then there's Traci Homol, the mother of a 5-year-old and a 7-year-old. She's worried about federal deficits and debt. \"We cannot afford Obamacare. This country absolutely cannot afford Obamacare. And what this election comes down to is are you going to vote for an entitlement society that's going to end up like Europe, broke, with everybody going, 'Oh, I'm not getting my stuff,' or are you going to be a self-reliant society where everybody goes, 'OK, we've got to buckle down, we've got to tighten the belt, we've got to move forward.' That's what I'm looking for. And that's why I want [Rick] Perry. And if it's not going to be Perry, then I will go with whoever is the Republican nominee \u2014 Newt,\" Homol said. \"Can we afford not to fix health care?  I mean, health care costs in the United States are twice as high as anywhere else in the world,\" Boudreau jumped in. Even at this fairly conservative table, the pharmacy student was not afraid to say she voted for President Obama in 2008. Boudreau still likes Obama, but New Hampshire residents can vote in either primary, and she's backing Jon Huntsman on Tuesday. Independent voters like her can be a factor here. Many independents are backing Ron Paul. When we named each candidate and asked these voters what words come to mind, though, Paul didn't do well with this particular group. \"Ineffective,\" \"scary,\" \"frightening,\" \"fanatical,\" they said. Other strong responses came for Newt Gingrich \u2014 words ranging from \"brilliant\" to \"over the top.\" Mitt Romney got everything from \"smart\" and \"organized\" to \"leadership\" to \"not trustworthy.\" Gail Gorham was dismayed that Romney had started to seem like the inevitable nominee. Then a disagreement developed. On one side was Dupere, a Gingrich fan, who thinks of Romney as a \"flip-flopper.\" On the other was Sweeney, our host, who dismissed Gingrich and came to Romney's defense. The women debated whether Mitt Romney has flip-flopped on abortion. \"That's a value you don't change on,\" said Dupere. \"How about Newt? you don't think he's changed his values about marriage and fidelity and [trustworthiness]?\" Sweeney shot back. \"Yes, but not about abortion. He's always been against abortion,\" Dupere replied. \"OK, so he's against abortion, but he's not against cheating and stealing,\" Sweeney said. Plenty of debate, but perhaps not much suspense in New Hampshire, where polls show Romney with a wide lead.",

Elaine Sweeney hosted the group, and they discussed the issues and the candidates on their minds.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Presidential candidates are making their appeals in events all over New Hampshire. But if you want to know what voters are thinking, it's better to drop by somebody's house, for a cup of coffee. Or, something stronger. Hey, how are you? SAMANTHA BOUDREAU: Hi, I'm Samantha Boudreau. INSKEEP: Hi Samantha. I'm Steve. BOUDREAU: Nice to meet you. INSKEEP: Hi. JEAN BELL: Jean Bell. INSKEEP: Hi, Jean. Thanks for joining us. I really appreciate it. ELAINE SWEENEY: Oh, 'cause I've got donuts and everything. We've got cheese and crackers and wine. You guys are good. (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER) SWEENEY: See, I've got donuts and coffee. So we have a choice. What would you like? We have some wine. Would you like some wine? INSKEEP: That's Elaine Sweeney, our host on an overcast day. SWEENEY: I think I'm going to have donuts with mine. I'm having donuts with my wine. INSKEEP: Her house in Derry, New Hampshire overlooks Beaver Lake, covered this time of year with a thin film of ice. We sit by a bank of windows with six New Hampshire women, all planning to vote in Tuesday's primary. We set the coffee, wine and donuts on a white lace tablecloth and talk politics. SWEENEY: I want to know what everybody felt about that debate last night. See, I got very upset\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: All the dumb questions, you mean? SWEENEY: Well, beyond the dumb questions... INSKEEP: Several of the women have been attending debate parties and candidate events. Linda Dupere has repeatedly attended protest rallies. LINDA DUPERE: I'm a Tea Partier. I have been since 2009. I've been to Washington four times. My husband and I, we want to see elected officials who are going to get in there and change big government. INSKEEP: All the women feel some connection to the issues dominating this election. Samantha Boudreau is 21 years old and studying to be a pharmacist. BOUDREAU: Job creation I think is a big issue. And in New Hampshire I think we've been doing pretty well in the past few months creating jobs. But being a student, I will be graduating next May and I'm going to have significant student loans to pay off, so getting a job is very important. INSKEEP: I don't mean to jump right off with a personal question, when you say significant student loans, about how much? BOUDREAU: It's going to be over $140,000. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Oh, my god. INSKEEP: So she's thinking about whether a job will be waiting when she graduates. These women range from students to retirees, and it's easy to hear the high expectations they will have for whoever wins this election. They want to cut back on federal spending, but at the same time, several collect Social Security and Medicare, and they don't want future generations to live worse than they did.

BOUDREAU: Can we afford not to do anything about health care? HOMOL: Yes. BOUDREAU: I mean health care costs in the United States are twice as expensive as they are anywhere else in the world. INSKEEP: The woman jumping in there is Samantha Boudreau, the pharmacy student, who even at this fairly conservative table is not afraid to say she voted for President Obama in 2008.

BOUDREAU: Scary. DUPERE: Mmm, frightening. SWEENEY: Fanatical. INSKEEP: Other strong responses come for Newt Gingrich - people in our group come up with words ranging from brilliant to over the top. Mitt Romney gets everything from smart and organized to leadership to not trustworthy. Gail Gorham is dismayed that Romney is starting to seem like the inevitable nominee. GAIL GORHAM: Yeah, I think he's going to make it, and I think he's going to beat Obama too. But it's not my choice, but I'm sure - it's a machine. There's nothing we can do about it. He's got such a lot of money, a lot more money than anybody else there, and he's - I mean I get three or four or five things I got in the mail yesterday from, you know, postcards and he's going to be here and he's going to - but we've gone to a lot of them, you know, but... INSKEEP: A disagreement develops in our talk. On one side is Linda Dupere, who's a Gingrich fan. She thinks of Romney as a flip-flopper. On the other is Elaine Sweeney, our host, who dismisses Gingrich and comes to Romney's defense. SWEENEY: With Romney, I see somebody that looks like a leader, acts like a leader, talks like a leader, and it's like the duck, you know? DUPERE: We are in desperate need of a leader. SWEENEY: Right. You're going to get people that are going to rally behind that man. INSKEEP: Does it bother you that you can watch videotape of Romney talking 10 years ago, or 12 years ago and he seems to have the opposite position? SWEENEY: No, it doesn't bother me at all because I changed - I've changed over this time. If you don't change with the times, then what good are you? You have to change with the times. DUPERE: But there are solid values that you should not change on. I believe that. SWEENEY: That's true. DUPERE: And when he implemented Romneycare in Massachusetts with a Planned Parenthood in that, Mitt Romney was for abortions and that is one thing that really bothers me. SWEENEY: But he's not now, is he? Well, he's flip-flopping. DUPERE: But yeah, he's flip-flopped. SWEENEY: What's wrong with changing your mind? DUPERE: But that's a value you don't change on, and you should not change on\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 SWEENEY: What you're saying\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 DUPERE: Once you did it, you can never get it back. SWEENEY: Are you saying - you keep saying that. How about Newt? You don't think he's changed his values about marriage, infidelity and trustworthy? DUPERE: Yeah, but not about - not about abortion. He's always been anti... SWEENEY: Oh my God. DUPERE: ...against abortion. SWEENEY: So, OK, so he's against abortion, but he's not against cheating and stealing... DUPERE: But so what makes you think Romney wouldn't do that again when he gets in? What makes you - see he wanted his health care plan passed... INSKEEP: As our conversation continues, one more voter has been sitting at the end of the table, mostly quiet. I think I know who everybody is supporting almost. Jean, I think I didn't hear from you who you're supporting. Who did... DUPERE: Pretty quiet over here. (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER) BELL: I've been taking it all in, right? INSKEEP: Do you know who you're voting for? BELL: Undecided. INSKEEP: You're undecided? As the voting nears, Jean Bell has been leaning more towards Mitt Romney, the man she expects to win, though other women at the table are urging her to come by at least one more campaign event before Tuesday. DUPERE: None of the other candidates run - do a town hall like Newt does. INSKEEP: Six women in Derry, New Hampshire, among the voters who expect to take part in the nation's first presidential primary tomorrow. DAVID GREENE, HOST: And let's now have a look at the story some of the latest polls in New Hampshire are telling. A poll by the University of New Hampshire and WMUR shows Mitt Romney leading with 41 percent, with Ron Paul in second place with 17 percent and Jon Huntsman and Rick Santorum tied for third, each with 11 percent. A Suffolk University poll puts Romney on top with a commanding lead, with Paul again behind him, Huntsman in third and Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum rounding out the top five. Rick Perry is at the bottom in both of those polls. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GREENE: This is NPR News. Copyright \u00a9 2012 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "This is the season of the presidential superPACs: They flooded Iowa with attack ads, and now they are looking ahead to primaries in South Carolina and Florida. SuperPACs (political action committees) can solicit big, corporate contributions \u2014 something candidates can't do. And, according to the law, superPACs are barred from coordinating their ads with the candidates they support. But it's not nearly that simple. A SuperPAC Attacks Take the superPAC Restore Our Future. It blanketed Iowa for a month before the Republican presidential caucuses with ads tearing down former House Speaker Newt Gingrich. In the whole barrage of ads, there was only one small hint of the candidate these ads were for \u2014 and you had to listen carefully. In a spot ridiculing Gingrich's \"mistakes,\" a narrator rattled off a list: \"immigration, Medicare, health care, Iraq, attacking Mitt Romney and more.\" That's right: Restore Our Future is the superPAC for former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney. And it was doing what superPACs do best \u2014 trashing the opposition while letting the candidate keep his distance. The consultants who run Restore Our Future declined to comment Friday. But Gingrich has been railing at Romney to stop the attacks. There's this myth that somehow there's a 'wink-wink, nod-nod' between the campaigns and the PACs, and I just haven't seen it. Cleta Mitchell, campaign finance lawyer \"This is a man whose staff created the PAC, his millionaire friends fund the PAC, he pretends he has nothing to do with the PAC \u2014 it's baloney. He's not telling the American people the truth,\" Gingrich said on CBS last week. Gingrich is suggesting that the Romney campaign and Restore Our Future violated federal regulations against illegal coordination. Debate Over The Ban The point of the regulations is that candidates run their campaigns on capped and disclosed contributions. And they shouldn't be able to run a backdoor operation with big, unregulated money. The coordination ban dates back to the 1990s, long before the Supreme Court handed down the Citizens United decision in 2010 and paved the way for presidential superPACs. There's a never-ending debate over whether the ban has teeth and whether the Federal Election Commission really enforces it. As Cleta Mitchell, a longtime campaign finance lawyer for conservative causes and candidates, puts it: \"There's this myth that somehow there's a 'wink-wink, nod-nod' between the campaigns and the PACs, and I just haven't seen it.\" Mitchell's current clients include one of the superPACs supporting Texas Gov. Rick Perry. Romney says he can't tell Restore Our Future to stop the ads, even if he wants to. \"If we coordinate, in any way whatsoever, we go to the big house,\" he explained on MSNBC last month. Mitchell says if she were advising a candidate or a campaign, \"I would say to them, 'Don't you ever comment publicly about anything the superPAC is saying. Don't ever say a word about it.' \" But not everyone agrees. They need to be worried about coordination. The question is: What definition of coordination do they need to be worried about? Larry Noble, former FEC general counsel \"I think a candidate is safe in making a public comment that they disavow a superPAC's ads, and they wish the superPAC would not do those ads,\" says Larry Noble, a former FEC general counsel now in private practice. A Murky Issue Now, there's also a superPAC for Gingrich. It's called Winning Our Future \u2014 as opposed to the Romney-supporting PAC, Restore Our Future. Political strategists nowadays say superPACs are a basic element in a presidential campaign. The senior adviser to Winning Our Future is Rick Tyler, a former aide to Gingrich. Tyler says the PAC takes its lead from Gingrich \u2014 but not in secret. So it's not coordination. \"What we can do is listen to the campaign and listen to the candidate through the media and determine what the campaign is doing, what the strategy is and echo that strategy, thus expanding the campaign,\" he says. Mitchell says, \"If it's in the public domain, it's fair game for the superPAC.\" But she says she also tells her clients: \"If you're going to be politically astute, what you probably should do is not try to mirror the campaign, but do your own research, your own poll and be able to say, 'Look, we made our own decision based on our own independent determination.' \" The coordination issue is such a mess, Noble says candidates and superPACs get a mixed message. \"They need to be worried about coordination,\" he says. \"The question is: What definition of coordination do they need to be worried about?\" And the reality is that it's hard to prove coordination. So Romney probably wouldn't have to worry about a trip to the big house. In fact, it's a long reach back in time \u2014 years, actually \u2014 to the last case of coordination in which the FEC assessed a penalty.",

Rick Santorum is interviewed after a debate with his Democratic challenger, Bob Casey, in 2006. Santorum later lost the Senate seat to Casey. Rick Santorum has been upsetting elections from the beginning. He was only 32 years old when he toppled a seven-term incumbent in a majority Democratic district in western Pennsylvania. Just four years later, Santorum rode the Republican wave of 1994 into the Senate representing Pennsylvania. And from the beginning, Santorum has stood for unwavering social conservatism, especially on the issue of abortion. \"Give the baby a chance to live,\" said Santorum while delivering a speech on the Senate floor in 1997. \"This unwarranted, unnecessary, unhealthful, dangerous, brutal, stabbing and killing of a baby who's this far away \u2014 three inches away \u2014 from its first breath.\" His remarks were among the first of many times he would lead the charge against a specific type of late abortion called intact dilation and extraction. Opponents call it \"partial-birth abortion.\" \"Why would you kill your child? Because your child is sick? Because your child might not live long?  Why kill your child?\" Santorum asked rhetorically during that same debate over the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act. Santorum's sharp, graphic language was often criticized by Democrats, who argued that the extremely rare procedure was sometimes necessary. The fight took years with Santorum at the forefront. I think most conservatives understand that individuals can't go it alone, that there is no such society that I am aware of where we've had radical individualism and that it succeeds as a culture. Rick Santorum, in a 2005 interview on NPR It wasn't until 2003, after the election of Republican President George W. Bush, that Santorum's partial-birth abortion ban was signed into law. It was upheld by the Supreme Court the following year. It is perhaps the single biggest accomplishment Santorum points to when he talks about his career in public service. A Fiscal Conservative, With Exceptions He also makes the case that he is a fiscal conservative. During his Senate career, Santorum did speak out for balanced budgets, lower taxes and privatizing Social Security. But he was much more ardent when it came to defending increased funding even as government was running up massive budget deficits. \"If the economy is strong, deficits go away,\" Santorum argued from the Capitol in 2003. He strongly supported Bush's request for tens of billions of dollars to continue fighting the war in Afghanistan. \"I think the president believes first and foremost we need a strong economy, and we need to fight the war on terrorism and potentially there are going to be other conflicts that we're going to engage in, and deficits have to take a back seat to that,\" said Santorum. Today, this idea that \"deficits have to take a back seat\" is anathema to the very definition of fiscal conservatism. It may be the issue where Santorum is most vulnerable in the coming Republican primaries. Time and again, Santorum supported Bush administration policies that ballooned the deficit. He voted for the Medicare prescription drug program and the No Child Left Behind education bill. He also supported foreign aid. Born: May 10, 1958, in Winchester, Va. Family: Married to Karen Santorum since 1990; seven children: Elizabeth, John, Daniel, Sarah Maria, Peter, Patrick and Isabella Education: B.A., Pennsylvania State University (1980); M.B.A., University of Pittsburgh (1981); J.D., Pennsylvania State University  Dickinson School of Law (1986) Career: Lawyer Elected Office: U.S. House of Representatives (1991-95); U.S. Senate (1995-2007) And every time Bush came back to Congress, asking for more money to fight and build infrastructure in Iraq, Santorum supported him. \"This is money that is absolutely necessary to fund our military effort, as well as to get this country up and going again,\" said Santorum. Staking His Record On Conservative Values Still, it was not on the fiscal issues, but on the social battles that Santorum made his name. When Democrats and Republicans worked together on the No Child Left Behind Act, Santorum fought for language challenging evolution and supporting the religious doctrine of intelligent design. When the Massachusetts Supreme Court upheld the right of gay people to marry, Santorum led the charge for a constitutional amendment defining marriage as between a man and a woman. On the Senate floor in the summer of 2004, Santorum made his case, saying gay marriage is bad for children. \"Society should be all about creating the best possible chance for children to have a mother and a father. And unless our state endorses that, unless our laws enforce that, then I think it's fairly obvious that our culture will not,\" said Santorum. The role of government in private life is a place where Santorum may differ with more libertarian conservatives. \"They have this idea that people should be left alone, be able to do whatever they want to do, we shouldn't get involved in bedroom, shouldn't get involved in cultural issues, well, that is not how traditional conservatives view the world and I think most conservatives understand that individuals can't go it alone, that there is no such society that I am aware of where we've had radical individualism and that it succeeds as a culture,\" Santorum said in a 2005 interview on NPR. Throughout his time in the Senate, Santorum argued government  has an important part to play in shepherding the American culture toward  what he called a strong moral purpose.",

The road to the magic number of 1,145 \u2014 delegates needed to clinch the GOP nomination \u2014 begins Tuesday.  The caucuses, all 1,774 of them, start at 7 pm Central time (8 Eastern), and results may start to trickle in within the hour. Here's a look at the field, presented in order of their standing in the final Des Moines Register poll, which was released Saturday night: Mitt Romney (leads poll with 24 percent):  The nominal frontrunner in what has been a most bizarre and topsy-turvy \"pre-season,\" Romney has the endorsements and the money, and he may ultimately have the voters.  Most polls show him as the most electable of all the GOP contenders.  Frankly, I can't see him not getting the nomination.  But we're just hours away from the Iowa caucuses and he has yet to pull away from his Republican rivals. I don't know if it's about his past positions, which were far more liberal as he was seeking office in Massachusetts, or his Mormon religion, which remains a problem with some Iowa evangelicals.  Maybe it's both. A loss in Iowa wouldn't necessarily cripple his chances \u2014 Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush and John McCain all lost the caucuses and went on to win the nomination.  And that would be especially true if he lost to either Ron Paul or Rick Santorum, whom no one sees as a likely nominee.  Still, despite early public reluctance to commit here, it is clear that Romney wants this.  And as President Obama's numbers start to creep up, the deciding factor in Romney's favor may be the polls that show him as the only Republican who has a shot at beating him.  Marker: Bob Dole's 26 percent in 1996 is the weakest showing for an Iowa winner. Ron Paul (second place with 22 percent):  Widely dismissed in 2008 (and ever since, for that matter) for his trail of out-of-mainstream views, Paul nonetheless has a committed libertarian/isolationist following that showed none of the fickleness that the other candidates experienced.  Nor can he be accused of shifting his positions; his opposition to big government, undeclared wars, the Fed's monetary policy and foreign aid have been a major part of him since he first came to Congress in 1976.  Unlike the rest of the field, he opposes a preemptive strike on Iran,  places much of the blame for 9/11 on U.S. foreign policy, and was  against the raid that took out Osama bin Laden.  He says following the Constitution is absolute, and blames both parties for the decline of America.  But he does it in a calm and almost sad manner, not with anger or fury, and that style has won over voters as well.  He has taken a hit in recent days about incendiary anti-black, anti-Zionist, anti-immigrant and anti-gay language that appeared in political newsletters under Paul's name in the early 1990s, in between Paul's two congressional stints.  This stuff first came out during Paul's previous presidential run four years ago.  But because he was not considered a factor \u2014 and indeed he wasn't, finishing fifth \u2014 few paid attention to it.  Paul may not have written the words, and he says he didn't.  But he refuses to renounce the support of those with such views.  And to blame the inclusion of the passages on poor oversight, as he has, is, well, disturbing. Paul has the money to stay in the race for a long time, which he did in 2008, well after it was clear he was not going to be the nominee.  But the question is whether his appeal, on the rise for weeks, may have hit a wall in the wake of these revelations.  And here's another question: Though he says he's not thinking of it, many suspect he might seek the Libertarian Party's nod.  He did that once before, in 1988, and he got 0.5 percent of the total vote.  But then he was a former congressman with no national following or recognition.  This year, with a proven record of appealing to disaffected Democrats and Republicans, could be different.  Numbers:  If elected president, Paul, at 77, would be the oldest in history. Rick Santorum (third with 15 percent):  If any candidate goes into Tuesday's caucuses with momentum, according to the Des Moines Register poll, it's Santorum.  Until now, he had been the only candidate not to experience a day in the sun as a \"frontrunner.\"  In fact, few were even talking about him. But his dogged determination in organizing in all 99 counties seems to have paid off, at least in the Register and CNN polls.  If the evangelical vote coalesces around him \u2014 he did get the backing of Bob Vander Plaats, a big deal with pro-family groups (though Rep. Steve King will remain neutral) \u2014 Santorum could be a factor.  And even if it is only third place, that's still much better than anyone could have imagined just a short time ago.  But a strong finish on Tuesday needs to be followed by strong finishes elsewhere, in states where he has not put in the time and effort he has in Iowa, and he is hampered by a lack of organization and money. Newt Gingrich (fourth with 12 percent):  Nobody illustrates the ups and downs of this pre-primary season quite like Gingrich.  He was all but left for dead after his staff quit en masse, in June, reflecting a disillusionment with his campaign strategy.  But a series of impressive debate performances, an insistence of not attacking his fellow Republicans, coupled with the collapse of the latest darling, Herman Cain, gave Gingrich new life and a huge boost in the polls.  \"I'm going to be the nominee,\" he said, and many people agreed.  But he's also saddled with tons of baggage that illustrates tremendous weaknesses as well (three marriages, money from Freddie Mac, a love fest with Nancy Pelosi, attacks on Paul Ryan's Medicare plan, attacks on \"Romneycare\" though he praised it in 2006, an oversized ego and a propensity to make incendiary and exaggerated comments, etc.).  Perhaps no one in Iowa has been the subject of as many brutal attack ads as Gingrich, most coming from the \"super PACs\" unofficially aligned with Romney and Perry.  And the absence of a strong bank account and campaign organization \u2014 witness his failure to get on the ballot in Virginia \u2014 underlines his inability to respond.  And speaking of his failure in Virginia, Gingrich's campaign chair had this to say: \"Newt and I agreed that the analogy is December 1941: We have  experienced an unexpected setback, but we will re-group and re-focus  with increased determination, commitment and positive action.\"  Pearl Harbor?  Only Newt Gingrich. Rick Perry (fifth with 11 percent):  Just as Michele Bachmann pushed her fellow Minnesotan Tim Pawlenty to the sidelines in the early debates, Perry's candidacy seemed to end Bachmann's reach for the stars from Day One.  But if the debates elevated Gingrich, they all but ruined Perry, who fumbled and stumbled his way through many of them and has never recovered; \"oops\" may be the debate word that best illustrates 2011.  Initially under assault by his rivals for what appeared to be a humane policy towards illegal immigrants, his record then began to be picked apart, especially over business deals back home that led Bachmann (as well as Sarah Palin) to refer to his \"crony capitalism.\"  As his numbers have shrunk his appeals to the religious right have intensified; his campaign ads note that \"I am a Christian,\" and he now says he opposes abortion even in cases of rape or incest. Michele Bachmann (sixth with 7 percent):  The lone woman in the race, her high-water mark was winning the straw poll in Ames back in August.  That same day, Perry got in the race and took away much of her thunder.  She has yet to regain her standing.  But to blame her collapse on Rick Perry simplifies what she was up against.  She had a series of gaffes and misstatements, offering up facts that sometimes were not, everything from misplacing Lexington and Concord  to taking someone's word that the HPV vaccination caused \"retardation\" to confusing one John Wayne with the other.  The final indignity came last week, as her Iowa campaign chair quit and joined the Paul effort.  Unless lightning strikes, she seems an all-but-certain casualty of the caucuses.  Numbers:  The only previous straw poll victor who finished way back in the caucus pack was Phil Gramm; the Texas senator tied Bob Dole at Ames but finished fifth with caucus participants in 1996. History. Here's a look at the results of contested GOP caucuses since 1980 (note: Iowa Republicans did hold a first-in-the-nation caucus in 1976, when President Gerald Ford was challenged by Ronald Reagan, but no official straw vote was taken.) 1980: Iowa winner \u2014 George H.W. Bush (32 percent) Rest of field \u2014 Ronald Reagan (30 percent), Howard Baker (15 percent), John Connally (9 percent), Phil Crane (7 percent), John Anderson (4 percent), Bob Dole (2 percent) 1979 straw poll winner \u2014 Bush Nominee \u2014 Reagan 1988: Iowa winner \u2014 Bob Dole (37 percent) Rest of field \u2014 Pat Robertson (25 percent), George H.W. Bush (19 percent), Jack Kemp (11 percent), Pete du Pont (7 percent) 1987 straw poll winner \u2014 Robertson Nominee \u2014 Bush 1996: Iowa winner \u2014 Bob Dole (26 percent) Rest of field \u2014 Pat Buchanan (23 percent), Lamar Alexander (18 percent), Steve Forbes (10 percent), Phil Gramm (9 percent), Alan Keyes (7 percent), Dick Lugar (4 percent), Morry Taylor (1 percent) 1995 straw poll winner \u2014 Dole and Gramm (tied) Nominee \u2014 Dole 2000: Iowa winner \u2014 George W. Bush (41 percent) Rest of field \u2014 Steve Forbes (30 percent), Alan Keyes (14 percent), Gary Bauer (9 percent), John McCain (5 percent)*, Orrin Hatch (1 percent) 1999 straw poll winner \u2014 Bush Nominee \u2014 Bush 2008: Iowa winner \u2014 Mike Huckabee (34 percent) Rest of field \u2014 Mitt Romney (25 percent), Fred Thompson (13 percent), John McCain (13 percent)*, Ron Paul (10 percent), Rudy Giuliani (4 percent)*, Duncan Hunter (1 percent) 2007 straw poll winner \u2014 Romney Nominee \u2014 McCain And speaking of history, here's a note from Steve Wylder of Elkhart, Ind.: I thought I heard you say that there were no Iowa  presidential caucuses before 1972. There were \u2014 it's just that they  weren't first-in-the-nation. Before 1972, they were held in March or  April, and thus largely ignored by the national media. But the McGovern  Commission was set up after the 1968 Democratic convention, which nominated  Hubert Humphrey even though he never entered a primary. (It wasn't  really Hubert's fault, as LBJ pulled out of the presidential race after  most deadlines for entering primaries had come and gone.) Anyway, the  McGovern Commission imposed fairly complicated rules for delegate  selection, especially for the inclusion of women, youth, and minorities.  Iowa Democrats decided to hold the caucuses early that year in order to  work out any bugs and/or challenges. That, at  least, was the official reason. I suspect the unstated reason was the  expectation that Sen. Harold E. Hughes (D) would be a presidential candidate  in '72. Hughes bowed out before the caucuses, endorsing Sen. Edmund  Muskie, who \"won,\" tying with \"Uncommitted\" at 36 per cent.  I remember  going to a caucus in January, which was basically designed to  organize the Hughes presidential campaign. As a result, I got stuck with  being precinct chairman for Penn Township in Johnson County, for which  I, as a 19-year-old, was unprepared. The Iowa Caucus process.  It won't touch your heart like \"War Horse\" or sadden you like \"The Descendants,\" but I'm telling you, this video we did four years ago in Iowa, about the history of the caucuses and how they differ from a primary, is must-see.  Well, kinda.  Click here to watch. (And then go to the mugshot halfway down the page on the left.) Candidates 2012. Nebraska's Ben Nelson becomes the 6th Democratic senator to opt out of re-election bid next year, joining Daniel Akaka of Haw., Jeff Bingaman of N.M., Kent Conrad of N.D., Jim Webb of Va. and Herb Kohl of Wis.  A Democratic-leaning independent, Joe Lieberman of Conn., and two Republicans, Jon Kyl of Ariz. and Kay Bailey Hutchison, are also retiring. ... Ricardo Sanchez, the former top U.S. commander in Iraq and the Democrats' favorite for the open Texas Senate seat, withdraws from the race. ... The all-but-ignored Gary Johnson, the former New Mexico governor who made it to one or two presidential debates, leaves the GOP to seek the Libertarian Party nomination.  Last Republican to drop out of the prez race to run outside the two-party system: John Anderson, 1980 ... Another Republican, developer Donald Trump, also quit the party in preparation for what may or may not be (do we really care) an independent bid for president. ... Rep. Steve Austria, whose 7th District in Ohio was sliced up in redistricting and was placed in the same CD as fellow Republican Mike Turner, announces he will retire and not seek a third term. ...  Scott Mackay of Rhode Island Public Radio tells us that Joseph P. Kennedy III, the 31 year old son of former Rep. Joe Kennedy II (and grandson of RFK), is likely to jump into the race to succeed the retiring Rep. Barney Frank (D) in Mass. Political Updates. I post periodic political updates during the week on Twitter. You can follow me at @kenrudin.  Meanwhile, here's some mail from my in-box: Q:  For all the focus on the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary, how many people actually sign up for the Iowa thing and are they restricted to registered Republicans?  And how many people show up for New Hampshire and is it an open primary? \u2014 Penney Kolb, Morgantown, W.Va. A:  Turnout in caucuses, which requires major commitment, are always dwarfed by turnout in primaries, where all you need to do is show up, vote, and skedaddle.  About 120,000 Republicans caucused in Iowa in 2008; in New Hampshire, which has a much smaller population, 235,000 Republicans voted.  (The GOP, reeling then under the unpopularity of President Bush, the state of the economy and the war in Iraq, is expected to see higher turnouts this year.) You must be a registered Republican to attend a Republican caucus in Iowa, but you can register at the caucus site.  Thus, some who are predicting a Ron Paul victory expect Democrats and independents to show up and declare their affinity for the GOP so they can vote for Paul.  In New Hampshire, independents can vote in either primary; they were instrumental in John McCain's 2000 and 2008 victories.  But Democrats may not vote in GOP primaries and vice versa. Q:  If I were a liberal in Iowa and I wanted to caucus for the GOP candidate most likely to win the nomination but lose to Obama, who would that be? \u2014 Shawn OHare, Clear Lake, Iowa A:  While the polls have fluctuated for much of the past few months \u2014 even Herman Cain was beating Obama in some polls \u2014 it seems that the president has regained some of his popularity.  At this point, at least, Romney is the only one who polls show is in striking distance of Obama. Q:  Who was the last Republican candidate who ran and won in a contested caucus in Iowa who became the party's nominee for president? \u2014 George Topor, Corte Madera, Calif. A:  George W. Bush, in 2000, and he won the Iowa triple crown that cycle.  He won the straw poll, the Iowa caucuses and the nomination.  And he went on to win the White House. Q:  Why are most of the candidates using their ad money to attack Newt Gingrich and Ron Paul instead of Mitt Romney? Is there some sort of agreement not to beat up Romney too much because he's the likely general election candidate? \u2014 Sally Sadoff, San Diego, Calif. A:  The battle in the GOP from the outset seemed to be which candidate would become the alternative to Romney, widely thought of as the establishment choice.  Anyone who watched the debates saw no shortage of attacks on Romney and his so-called flip-flops.  But the assumption is that as the race goes on it will be Romney vs. the anti-Romney, and thus the other candidates are aggressively seeking the mantle of the latter.  Note that with the apparent rise of Rick Santorum has come attacks on him from others in the race, notably Rick Perry, who has this clever \"Jeopardy\" style ad up: Q:  If Newt Gingrich becomes president, would he be the first Ph.D to achieve that office? \u2014 Rick Thurmond, Cobb, Calif. A:  The second.  The first was Woodrow Wilson, who was awarded his Ph.D. doctorate in 1886, following the publication of his book, Congressional Government.  2011 Farewells. Lots of responses to last week's column, a voluminous listing of those in the political world who died in 2011.  Lou Cannon, the former Washington Post reporter and Ronald Reagan biographer, sent in this: It's good you do this compilation at the end of every year on those we've lost.  This was poignant year for me; David Broder was my mentor and close friend and colleague at the Post.  Dick Wirthlin's data and insights guide me in stories and books. Mark Hatfield and Chuck Percy, both of whom I covered, were straight-shooters, with their constituents and the press. I kept in touch with Hatfield and had the honor of doing the Hatfield Lecture one year for the Oregon Historical Society. There were many others on your to whom I was indebted, including George Gallup Sr. and [former California congressman] Steve Horn.  It's good to take time to remember them all. Al Eisele, the editor-at-large for The Hill who was the press secretary for former Vice President Walter Mondale: Didn't realize we'd lost so many of them in the past year. I attended memorials services for three \u2014 Eleanor Mondale, Hal Bruno and Milt Gwirtzman, and covered at least half of them at one time or another. Please keep me off the list for at least 10 more years. Craig Shirley, the conservative consultant and author of the new book, \"December 1941: 31 Days that Changed America and Saved the World,\" had this: The odd and sad fact is I knew so many of the people who have died in the last several years.  It is weird to say to my wife, \"I just had dinner with that person.\"  Or, \"I just saw so and so.\"  The other day my son Matt said I was middle aged to which I replied, \"Yeah? How many 110 year old men do you know?\"  But life goes on, eh? Antony Pate of Washington, DC., added this: \"Many of the people you mention were well-known, and well-recognized, upon their deaths; but your references to Bill Monroe, John Armstrong, Mike Posner, and Leonard Weinglass, among others, were well-deserved and much-appreciated.\" I said my list hardly claims to be complete, and I invited readers to send in the names of those I missed.  John Hiestand of Hillsboro, Ohio, had one:  former Rep. James Quigley (D-Pa.), who was elected in 1954, defeated in 1956, elected again in 1958, and defeated again in 1960; he died on Dec. 15 at the age of 93. And James McKinstra of Aurora, Minn., and a \"near life-long Illinoisan\" until last year, lists two Illinoisans who died: former First Lady Lura Lynn Ryan, wife of ex-Gov. George Ryan, and former Chicago First Lady Maggie Daley, wife of ex-Mayor Richard M. Daley. Political Junkie segment on Talk of the Nation.

Last week's segment had Ron in Washington and me in Des Moines.   You can listen to the latest episode here: And speaking of Des Moines ... a big thanks to the staff at Iowa Public Radio, who was gracious and wonderful in having the TOTN Junkie segment come out of their studios.  At a get together with supporters of IPR afterwards, I had the pleasure of meeting many people who generously give their time and money to making public radio possible.  At the reception were two former Republican lt. govs. of Iowa, Joy Corning \u2014 who served two terms under Terry Branstad \u2014 and Arthur Neu, who was first elected in the 1970s.  Both were delightful, and they tolerated my desire to go down memory lane with them. And as long as we're on the subject of Arthur Neu, how can we avoid using his campaign button in this mini-ScuttleButton messsage? (see buttons at left) ON THE CALENDAR: Jan. 3 \u2014 IOWA CAUCUSES.

Barack Obama of Illinois wins the Iowa Democratic presidential caucuses, the first step en route to becoming the first African-American elected to the White House.  In the caucuses he is followed by former Sen. John Edwards (N.C.) and Sen. Hillary Clinton (N.Y.).  Two other Democrats, Sens. Chris Dodd and Joe Biden, finish in single digits and drop out of the race.  On the Republican side, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, with strong evangelical Christian support, beats out another ex-gov., Mitt Romney of Massachusetts.  Former Sen. Fred Thompson (Tenn.) finishes third, followed by Sen. John McCain (Ariz.), who didn't compete in Iowa but will go on to win the GOP nomination (Jan. 3, 2008). Got a question? Ask Ken Rudin: politicaljunkie@npr.org",
