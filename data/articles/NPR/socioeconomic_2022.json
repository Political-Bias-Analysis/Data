            "article_content": "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. \u2014 A federal appeals court granted Florida's request to reinstate portions of the state's election law on Friday while it appeals a lower court's decision that the law was aimed at suppressing Black voters. The 11th Circuit Court of Appeals said that Judge Mark Walker's March ruling that the law intentionally targeted Black voters was flawed. The three-judge panel said there wasn't evidence that the law was passed with the intent to discriminate, and issued the stay as an appeal continues. The law tightens rules on mailed ballots, drop boxes and other popular election methods \u2014 changes that made it more difficult for Black voters who, overall, have more socioeconomic disadvantages than white voters, Walker wrote in his ruling. Florida's Republican-led legislature joined several others around the country in passing election reforms after Republican former President Donald Trump made unfounded claims that the 2020 election was stolen from him. Democrats have called such reforms a partisan attempt to keep some voters from the ballot box. Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis made the election bill a 2021 priority. The state was immediately sued by voting rights groups. \"We are deeply disappointed and disturbed by today's appeals court decision, putting back in place one of the most restrictive voting rights laws in the country. Let's be clear, this law undoes the progress that voting rights groups have made and targets the very tools minority communities, like ours, use to increase voter turnout,\" Jasmine Burney-Clark, founder of Equal Ground, said in a news release. Much of the debate focused on vote-by-mail ballots and how they are collected and returned. Walker overturned a provision of the law limiting when people could use a drop box to submit their ballot, along with a section prohibiting anyone from engaging with people waiting to vote. Walker said the latter provision \"discourages groups who give food, water, and other forms of encouragement to voters waiting in long lines from continuing to do so.\" DeSantis predicted after Walker's ruling that the state would win the case in front of the more conservative appeals court. Walker was appointed by former President Barack Obama. The three judges that issued the stay were appointed by former President Donald Trump, including Barbara Lagoa, who briefly served on the Florida Supreme Court as a DeSantis appointee.",

PARIS \u2014 French President Emmanuel Macron, who hardly campaigned ahead of the first round of voting, hit the campaign trail early Monday morning following Sunday's results that showed him leading his rival Marine Le Pen by just five percentage points, with 27.6% of the vote. Macron has two weeks to persuade the French to give him another term, rather than gamble the future of the country on what many say is Le Pen's extremist vision. Macron's first stop was the northern town of Denain, which has the distinction of being the poorest municipality in France. Television footage showed the president in shirt sleeves, talking and meeting with people in this blighted former coal mining region of France. \"Don't forget about us in down and out France,\" one man pleaded with Macron. Denain voted for Le Pen 41% in the first round, compared to 17% for Macron. Macron and Le Pen faced each other in the runoff five years ago and Macron beat her handily, attracting 66% of the vote. But much has changed since 2017. While Macron is still predicted to win in the second round, the margin is much smaller, and analysts say Marine Le Pen has a real chance this time. There are several reasons for this. One is the French electorate in general has moved to the right. Le Pen has enlarged her support base, and more voters are choosing the extremes. The mainstream left and right has all but disappeared. The parties of Charles DeGaulle and Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand barely reached 5% this time. More than 50% of votes in this past weekend's first round went to extremists. Some analysts say there are now three voting blocs: centrist, far left and far right. Others say the right left divide has disappeared, and is replaced by a new paradigm, globalist vs sovereigntist. On a personal level, Le Pen has softened her image and detoxified her party to appear more mainstream. It's worked partly because another even further-right candidate, Eric Zemmour, has been the one whipping up anti-immigrant sentiment, while Le Pen has stuck to bread-and-butter economic issues such as purchasing power. That paid off, said 26-year-old supporter David, who prefers not to give his last name. French far-right party Rassemblement National (RN) presidential candidate Marine Le Pen poses for a picture with a supporter holding a French national flag during a visit at a grain farm as part of her campaign for the second round of the French presidential election, on April 11, 2022 in Soucy, Burgundy.\n                \n                    \n                    EMMANUEL DUNAND/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption French far-right party Rassemblement National (RN) presidential candidate Marine Le Pen poses for a picture with a supporter holding a French national flag during a visit at a grain farm as part of her campaign for the second round of the French presidential election, on April 11, 2022 in Soucy, Burgundy. \"She has been campaigning on the ground, going to markets, meeting people across France,\" he said. \"This is why she got so many votes in the first round. And this is why she will win in two weeks.\" Macron is no longer the political wunderkind of five years ago. Au contraire, there is a deep resentment of him in many quarters throughout the country. Those on the left who voted for him feel betrayed, and he's generally perceived as an arrogant, elitist whose policies favor the rich. \"Anybody but Macron\" has become a mantra for some. Le Pen can expect to pick up far right candidate Zemmour's voters; he finished the race in fourth place with 7% of the vote. Macron, meanwhile, has no deep well of voters to tap into. Far-left firebrand Jean Luc Melenchon, who came in third place just behind Le Pen, told his supporters that \"not one single vote can go to Madame Le Pen.\" Yet he did not endorse Macron. Both Macron and Le Pen are now vying for his voters. It is not far-fetched to imagine Melenchon's voters potentially supporting Le Pen. The French far-left and far-right have similar socioeconomic platforms - support for the working class and hatred of a globalized capitalist system they say benefits elites and corporations. Pollster Brice Teinturier told France 2 News that the battle between Macron and Le Pen is really about a battle of two distinct visions of France. \"We have the France of those doing well, they're confident they have high salaries and they vote massively for Macron,\" he said. \"And the other France with low salaries, worries for its future. And they can barely make ends meet. They vote Le Pen.\" Martin Quencez, deputy director of the Paris office of the German Marshall Fund, said French voters' choice on April 24 will have deep consequences in France and on the  world stage. \"The vision \u2014 especially in foreign policy \u2014 that Marine Le Pen promotes is extremely different from the one that Emmanuel Macron supports,\" he said. Quencez said despite Le Pen trying to normalize her image and cut some of the most controversial slogans from her program, the details of her platform haven't actually changed that much. \"It is still about withdrawing from NATO's military command, and rethinking France's partnership with the EU, with the U.S. and with Russia.\" Macron will be hammering home that message over the next two weeks: How a vote for Le Pen will be a vote to take France in a dangerous new direction. A Macron campaign ad shows a half Le Pen half Russian President Vladimir Putin face, with a quote from Le Pen speaking with a journalist dated March 31. \"Can Putin become an ally of the West again?\" asked the reporter. \"Of course,\" Le Pen said.",

            "article_content": "Incumbent Emmanuel Macron got the most votes in the first-round of France's presidential election, but the runoff battle with his far-right challenger looks set to be a hard fight.  DANIEL ESTRIN, HOST: The French presidential race is intensifying as the two leading candidates from the first round Sunday prepare for the second-round runoff. Incumbent President Emmanuel Macron will face far-right leader Marine Le Pen for the second time. The two ran off in the last presidential election five years ago, and Macron handily beat Le Pen with 66% of the vote. But as NPR's Eleanor Beardsley reports, much has changed since then. ELEANOR BEARDSLEY, BYLINE: Macron barely campaigned ahead of the first round, but he hit the ground running Monday morning, showing up in France's poorest town, Denain, in the north of the country. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: (Speaking French). BEARDSLEY: \"Please think of us in the down-and-out France,\" a resident pleaded. \"We're living in misery.\" The town went 41% for Marine Le Pen. Macron got 17%. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE: (Chanting in non-English language). BEARDSLEY: In Paris, Le Pen's supporters were ecstatic on Sunday night. Their candidate got 23.5% of the vote to Macron's 27.5%, only a four-point difference. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) MARINE LE PEN: (Speaking French). BEARDSLEY: Analysts say Marine Le Pen has a real chance this time. French voters in general have moved to the right, and she has softened her image, appearing more mainstream. That's partly because another, even further-right candidate whipped up anti-immigrant sentiment this time, while Le Pen stuck to bread-and-butter economic issues like purchasing power. That paid off, says 26-year-old supporter David, who prefers not to give his last name. DAVID: (Through interpreter) She has been campaigning on ground, going to markets, meeting people across France. This is why she got so many votes in the first round, and this is why she will win in two weeks. BEARDSLEY: Macron is no longer perceived as the wunderkind of politics, miraculously uniting the left and right. He's become an arrogant elitist to many. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: (Speaking French). BEARDSLEY: At his rally across town from Le Pen's, Macron said he knew many of those who would vote for him in the second round were only doing so to block the far right. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: (Speaking French). BEARDSLEY: This Macron supporter told French television he knows there's deep anti-Macron sentiment across the country, but voters have to prioritize blocking the far-right. Gone are the large mainstream right and left blocs. The parties of Charles de Gaulle and Francois Mitterrand barely reached 5% this time. More than 50% of votes went to extremists. Far-left firebrand Jean-Luc Melenchon came in third place, just one percentage point behind Le Pen. Both Le Pen and Macron are now vying for his voters. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) JEAN-LUC MELENCHON: (Speaking French). BEARDSLEY: Melenchon told his supporters not a single vote could go to Madame Le Pen. But he did not endorse Macron. Melenchon's supporters could vote for Le Pen, because the French far-left and far-right have similar socioeconomic platforms - support for the working class and hatred of a globalized, capitalist system they say benefits elites and corporations. Martin Quencez, deputy director of the Paris office of the German Marshall Fund, says this election is a choice between two different visions of France. MARTIN QUENCEZ: Although there has been an enormous effort by Marine Le Pen to sort of normalize her image and to cut some of the most controversial slogans from her program, if you look at the details, it hasn't changed that much. The vision that Marine Le Pen promotes is extremely different from the one that Emmanuel Macron supports. BEARDSLEY: Under Le Pen, he says, France wouldn't lead the EU; it would opt out of its policies. And it would likely quit NATO's Central Command. And France's closest allies might not include the U.S., but rather countries like Serbia, Hungary and even Russia. Eleanor Beardsley, NPR News, Paris. Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.

TALLAHASSEE, Fla. \u2014 A federal judge struck down portions of a Florida election law passed last year, saying in a ruling Thursday that the Republican-led government was using subtle tactics to suppress Black voters. The law tightened rules on mailed ballots, drop boxes and other popular election methods \u2014 changes that made it more difficult for Black voters who, overall, have more socioeconomic disadvantages than white voters, U.S. District Judge Mark Walker wrote in his ruling. \"For the past 20 years, the majority in the Florida Legislature has attacked the voting rights of its Black constituents,\" Walker wrote. Given that history, he said, some future election law changes should be subject to court approval. Florida's Republican-led legislature joined several others around the country in passing election reforms after Republican former President Donald Trump made unfounded claims that the 2020 election was stolen from him. Democrats have called such reforms a partisan attempt to keep some voters from the ballot box. \"It was only designed to fuel the narrative around the big lie and that the election was stolen from Trump,\" Democratic state Rep. Fentrice Driskell, who is Black, said in a phone interview after the ruling was issued. \"What we absolutely can't have is a system that, I almost feel like, is separate and unequal. Making it harder for Black people to vote is unconstitutional.\" Democratic state Rep. Ramon Alexander said he and others argued before the bill passed that it would disproportionally affect voters of color, and he is glad Walker agreed. \"Florida has a long history of discrimination at the ballot box, and [the bill] was just another roadblock put in front of Black people trying to cast a legal vote,\" said Alexander, who is Black. Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, who made the election bill a priority, said the state will appeal Walker's decision and win. \"In front of certain district judges, we know we will lose no matter what because they are not going to follow the law,\" DeSantis said at a news conference in West Palm Beach. He did not say specifically why he believes the ruling is incorrect. Upon appeal, the case would go to the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta, Georgia, which is seen as being more conservative. Republican Sen. Dennis Baxley, who sponsored the bill, didn't immediately return a voicemail message seeking comment. Much of the debate focused on vote-by-mail ballots and how they are collected and returned. Walker overturned a provision of the law limiting when people could use a drop box to submit their ballot, along with a section prohibiting anyone from engaging with people waiting to vote. Walker said the latter provision \"discourages groups who give food, water, and other forms of encouragement to voters waiting in long lines from continuing to do so.\" \"One way, then, to measure whether this provision will have a disparate impact on Black or Latino voters is to determine whether Black and Latino voters are disproportionately likely to wait in line to vote,\" said Walker, citing testimony that showed that to indeed be the case. Walker, who was appointed by former President Barack Obama, also overturned a provision in the law putting new restrictions on groups that register voters, including requiring that people working to register voters submit their names and permanent addresses to the state. Walker ordered that for the next 10 years, any attempt by the Legislature to write new laws on the issues he overturned will need court approval. \"Floridians have been forced to live under a law that violates their rights on multiple fronts for over a year,\" he wrote. \"Without preclearance, Florida could continue to enact such laws, replacing them every legislative session if courts view them with skepticism. Such a scheme makes a mockery of the rule of law.\"",

Well, all the parts. For me that means my Latinidad, my heritage, my experience growing up in Texas with an Ecuadorian mother and a Mexican father. Both of their cultures, as well as the one our family cultivated amongst ourselves and our community in small town Texas. The traditions and influence of the Lizarragas have shaped really important parts of my identity, too. Anyone from a big, loud family will tell you! I'm the middle child of five. My dad is one of six. His mom, my mama Inelda, is one of 11. I'm shaped so much by my family dynamic. And the experiences that have come with being from a poor, first-generation, proud, hardworking, religious, loyal, opinionated, sometimes overbearing but always loving immigrant family. I am also an experienced reporter and journalist. I put myself through college, lived and worked in Ecuador, the only one of my siblings to ever leave Texas. I'm in the last year of my twenties. I'm an aunt and a godmother. A woman. A sister. A friend. A partner. An introverted-extrovert. A hugger! You know, there are a lot of different facets. And so there's a lot of opportunity, I hope, to bring all of those parts of me to NPR and our Code Switch listeners. I'm looking forward to your contribution to the show. So why did you apply to be a co-host on Code Switch? For this next full-time role, I really wanted to prioritize the two parts of my professional career that I care the most about. First, the hard-hitting , investigative journalism, accountability reporting that I love. Second, championing  better and more representation, access and opportunity for Black and Brown journalists and our communities. But trying to find a job that let me marry those two skills was one dead end after another. The industry of journalism and the world of DEI were both saying, \"us or them.\" If I wanted to be a reporter, I would have to \"check my biases\" at the door \u2014 sacrificing the diverse perspective that makes the work so much more valuable. If I wanted to prioritize my perspective toward the advancement of marginalized communities, I would have to be an activist, a DEI officer or run for office \u2014 sacrificing the power of holding the mic for the chance to speak into it. And then came Code Switch. This team and the work they do was truly the first and only opportunity that I found that marries the two skills, sees the value and calls it the mission. Literally, the show description says, \"It's the fearless conversations about race that you've been waiting for, hosted by journalists of color...\" I'm giddy just reading that again. Because it's such a happy, hopeful dream come true to be in a position that I truly thought didn't exist. I'm so glad that it does and that I now have a chance to bring the best parts of my skills and my perspective to the stories we tell, the language we use, the conversations we elevate, the dilemmas we unpack, the struggles we illuminate and the voice we bring to this massive subject of race. I'm so proud of what's to come and I am so excited.

That's inspiring that you were able to find that intersection and to know that intersection exists. What about your journey do you think is the reason that you're here? Absolutely all of it. I think every part of my journey and all the experiences along the way contribute to what qualifies me for this role. And I just appreciate that there are people like Steve Drummond, my new boss, who saw that value in me and all of my experiences and chose to elevate me to this role. Who I am, where I'm from, what I've been through, my experience reporting for years all over the country, as well as the value of this last year and a half in my career after turning my reporting on my experience as a journalist of color in Denver. That reporting sounded an alarm for more representation in news and helped to affect new immigration coverage standards at more than 60 TV news stations across the country. I knew there was a lot of room for more culturally sensitive language, more representative coverage, more diversity in the newsroom and in the news. When those goals were blocked in the newsroom, I did what journalists do \u2014 I watched, I listened, I took notes, I asked questions, I looked for answers and tried to find solutions. When that didn't work, I reported on that experience and the ways it was really a mirror of the larger problems within the entire industry. That reporting and that conviction I think were equal parts the catalyst for my being here. And I think what's so amazing is that there was a time when speaking out would have been the disqualifier, would have been the thing you shouldn't do in the industry because you'd never see another full time job in this industry again. Like I said, I'm just glad that NPR didn't see it that way, and I think a lot of people are really, really proud and encouraged to see the industry responding to me that way.

Why do you think that is? I'm joining a team where having these tough conversations is by design, and looking at race conflicts and tensions is part of the work that Code Switch does. Because of that, I'm joining a team that's at a really different starting line. It's already a really different environment than where I've been in mainstream news, and for this moment of my career that's a really good thing. The team at Code Switch is tasked with unpacking race and identity and how that intersects and interacts with everything else in our society. My experiences as a social justice and community field reporter along with my lived experiences make this a really, really good fit. Beyond that, I'm working with a team full of diverse professionals with beautiful backgrounds and unique identities, all of which are essential to the robustness of the team and the content this team is known for creating. That I consider my diversity inherently valuable, that I come with representative, intellectual rigor that may challenge the status quo, and that I intend to elevate stories from the communities to which I belong and identify closely and personally may be \"controversial,\" but is also all very much aligned with the work of Code Switch. You asked me what I think my story does for other people who want to speak out. I think it's probably encouraging to follow the polished, curated parts of this journey that I have shared on my way to this incredible opportunity at NPR today after publicly speaking out against the lack of representation in the industry last year. But my hope is not that other people, other young journalists of color, should have to go through the same experiences in a newsroom that I went through, to fight the same fights I fought, or for things to be so desperate that they would be willing to become a sacrificial lamb on the way to overdue, obvious progress. My hope is that the more of us who get into these spaces and succeed, and the more allies we garner \u2013 the more that these patterns will start to resolve themselves from the inside out as a result. Risking your career shouldn't be the norm or the standard to effect lasting, necessary change. It really comes down to managers and newsrooms prioritizing a different culture \u2013 a more inclusive, more representative, more empowering culture both in the newsroom and in the storytelling and coverage. I think the more that we come together, the less it will require one individual's sacrifice. The industry is changing.

What I'm prioritizing coming into NPR and Code Switch, though, is showing up authentically for my community, for my family, for myself, and for anyone who sees themselves in me and in the last name Lizarraga. As far as my new mantra goes, for now I'm beating to a tune that sounds a lot like gratitude.

So how has your transition to NPR been, and what surprised you about this place? Sound Bites [the NPR HQ cafeteria] came out of left field and upgraded my life in a way I didn't even know I needed! Seriously, the weekly themed lunch menus make me feel like a school kid again. So that's been a total treat. Beyond that, NPR HQ is just massive. The D.C. office is beautiful, and so much bigger than I expected. Especially after being in a pandemic lifestyle the last two years, you forget how many people it takes on any given day to put out the kind of quality content in the quantities that NPR does. It's cool to see how many people are making this NPR thing happen. And it's really fun to be back in person again, honestly. I forgot how much energy comes from being in the same room with like-minded, driven, diligent people who are as excited as I am to nerd out over news, current events, content creation, doing stories differently, doing stories better. There's only so much that your friends who aren't in news and media can talk about this stuff before they're begging for a new topic of conversation, right? It's fun to have people who are as excited about it as I am. Surrounding ourselves with that energy is really important, I think. It gets you excited about coming into work, about doing the work, and about doing it the best that you can. It's been a great whirlwind of a first month at NPR for me and I will have to let you know how this transition has been once I catch my breath. What conversations are you looking forward to having, and is there anybody that you want to interview? Or any topics that you're like, \"We have to talk about this\"? I think this is such a unique time to be looking at current events \u2013 what's happening in the world with elections, climate change, inflation, policing, the housing market, literally any headline that you hear or read on any given day on your Twitter feed or what your friends are talking about. There is always a throughline of race, culture and identity in the mix. So I'm really excited to be a part of those conversations that everybody is talking about, but with the informed perspectives and thoughtful framework that Code Switch brings, doing what Code Switch does so well by creating these long-form opportunities for people to sit down and really educate and challenge themselves on the topics of race, culture and identity. I'm also looking forward to lending the Code Switch expertise where mainstream news doesn't have the capacity or know-how to truly reflect or expand on challenging racially charged issues and stories. Not just for the sake of having a Black person talk about it or having a Latina on the show, but really lending our lived and learned experiences to the conversation to illuminate some nuanced but important insight on a complicated issue. Between the three of us hosts, there is a Latino background, an immigrant background, a mixed status family background, single-parent home background, small town backgrounds, varying socioeconomic backgrounds, how we grew up, where we grew up, how we talk, who we know, who we care about, the language that we use. All of that is so valuable, and while I know we are competing for people's attention in a seriously oversaturated medium, I'm excited to continue to stand out because of the voices that make Code Switch so unique and so valuable. There are a lot of current events and real world issues over the last year that I would have loved to have had the voices of Code Switch educating me about. I'm hoping that we can be more involved in real time with a 3-host stacked show now.

After that, the team will reconvene in DC to work on my official introductory episode to the world later this month. I'm so excited for all of it. November will be a huge month. An incredible part of this experience, among many, is that it's been eyes wide open on everybody's part. I'm coming into this role with a lot of reporting, editing, writing, cutting and producing experience, but not nearly the expertise that my NPR colleagues have with audio and podcasting. My team and my boss know that and have carved out a large window of time for me to get comfortable, to ask questions, to learn from the best, and take the time I need to get trained and get comfortable with this medium. I really, really appreciate that. I've been in a lot of jobs where it's sink or swim. This team hasn't put \"sink\" on the menu and I'm all about it. They're giving me a long runway to get it all right and the content is going to reflect that. I can't wait for everybody to hear what we have in store in this new era of Code Switch.",

Sri Lanka's parliament elected longtime politician Ranil Wickremesinghe as the country's new president in a secret ballot on Wednesday. He previously served as prime minister to the former president, Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who fled the country a week ago after months of protests calling for his resignation. Due to Wickremesinghe's close association with the former president, many protesters entered and torched his house last week, and have called on him to resign as well. Wickremesinghe takes office as Sri Lanka's economy continues to face soaring inflation, and shortages of essential goods like food, fuel and medicine. Many Sri Lankans are still waiting hours in line to buy basic supplies, often at prices that have doubled or tripled in recent months. The World Food Program's most recent analysis reported that 86% of families were either skipping meals, eating less or buying worse food. President-elect Ranil Wickremesinghe greats supporters upon his arrival at a buddhist temple in Colombo, Sri Lanka on Wednesday.\n                \n                    \n                    Eranga Jayawardena/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption President-elect Ranil Wickremesinghe greats supporters upon his arrival at a buddhist temple in Colombo, Sri Lanka on Wednesday. Sri Lankan historian at Oxford University Shamara Wettimuny said that former president Rajapaksa's rule was, \"To put it bluntly, a short-lived train wreck.\" She spoke with All Things Considered about what Sri Lankans are expecting from the new administration, and what led to this moment. On whether Wickremesinghe has signaled any plans to staunch the country's economic crisis He has made some progress in terms of negotiating with the IMF, who we're hoping to get some sort of bailout from, and he has been working to try and improve our fuel situation. But those changes are yet to be felt at the ground level. Walking around Colombo at the moment, we just see queues of cars snaking around the city, where people have been queuing for days to get petrol. So the crisis is still very real and still to be resolved. On the political journey of Sri Lanka's former president, who is now in exile Gotabaya Rajapaksa was new to electoral politics. He has a military background, and he then served as the defense secretary under his brother Mahinda Rajapaksa's government between 2005 to 2015. The Rajapaksa government during the civil war is widely seen as ruthless in ending a conflict that lasted over 30 years, but there are still huge gaps in accountability. The end of the war was bloody, and a lot of Tamils were killed or disappeared. And these families of the disappeared are still searching for answers. His campaign to run for president in 2019 was his first electoral campaign. It has been, to put it bluntly, a short lived train wreck. He came into power in November 2019 on a platform of economic progress, as well as national security. And the reality is, he's delivered neither. I need to stress that his policy of \"national security\" actually referred to the persecution of minorities, the Muslim minority in particular ... in response to the Easter Sunday Islamist attacks that took place in Sri Lanka in April 2019. However, following the onset of COVID, the economy took a hit. In the last year, one of the biggest mistakes this former president made was to introduce, overnight, a ban on fertilizers and ... an organic fertilizer policy. But with little to no preparation, farmers were simply unprepared and our harvest has suffered as a result. This failed fertilizer policy is part of the reason we are facing huge food shortages at the moment and that has added to the crisis that we're currently experiencing. A protester waves a national flag and shouts slogans demanding elected president Ranil Wickremesinghe step down during a protest at the presidential secretariat premise on Wednesday.\n                \n                    \n                    Rafiq Maqbool/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption A protester waves a national flag and shouts slogans demanding elected president Ranil Wickremesinghe step down during a protest at the presidential secretariat premise on Wednesday. On where this regime drew its support from within Sri Lankan society The regime under Gotabaya Rajapaksa really did draw support from the Sinhala Buddhist majority. The Sinhalese [are] the largest ethnic community, which overwhelmingly identifies as Buddhist, they're about 70% of the population. He came into power in November 2019, vowing to bring them economic prosperity, but also to protect them from the minorities. His election campaign was undeniably one that said that he would put the minorities back in their place. On what led to the demands for resignation of then-President Rajapaksa The economy is probably the biggest issue. In terms of agriculture, the failed fertilizer policy has meant that we are really facing immense food shortages. We're having huge food price inflation, and inflation more generally. And more recently, we've been having long power cuts. So for instance, between March and April, some people experienced power cuts for as long as 10 hours. In the last few months, there have been massive shortages of fuel and gas with people unable to find the gas necessary to cook. A lot of families have been reporting that they've been reduced to one meal a day. On whether she thinks the diverse coalition behind the protests will persist The protesters united around this idea which in Sinhala is called the \"Aragalaya,\" it means \"the struggle.\" They have responded to the appointment of Ranil Wickremesinghe as president and they have said that they see him as an illegitimate president, and that they will continue the protest. There will be others, of course, across Sri Lanka who will say \"give Ranil a chance to do the work he has done. He has seen successes in terms of economic policies in the past, maybe he is one of the people who can actually help us navigate this course.\" But no, I don't see the protests going away anytime soon. On how Ranil Wickremesinghe might rule as the country's next president Starting off on a negative note, since becoming the acting president, following President Rajapaksa's resignation, he introduced curfew and declared a state of emergency. Protesters shout slogans demanding elected president Ranil Wickremesinghe step down on Wednesday.\n                \n                    \n                    Rafiq Maqbool/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Protesters shout slogans demanding elected president Ranil Wickremesinghe step down on Wednesday. Now, a lot of people will say the only emergency is the food crisis and the energy crisis. But that does not warrant the emergency that he declared. And so a lot of the public see the emergency that he declared and the regulations that were published under emergency as [a means] to protect himself and the MPs that the public are protesting against. So that's really not a very hopeful sign. However, he is in talks with the IMF. A lot of the international community have agreed to work with Wickremesinghe. And so, I assume he will prioritize the economic sector going forward. On whether the recent protests have overcome Sri Lanka's ethnic divide I'm afraid I would have to say that it's unlikely that the ethnic divide would be overcome so soon. A lot of the Sinhalese who are on the street protesting right now are not out because they disapprove of the human rights violations that have taken place under various Rajapaksa governments. They're there mostly for economic reasons. And it's one reason that a lot of the minorities have been skeptical about joining the protests, even though they have participated. And so I'm afraid to say that, once the immediate economic crisis is solved, a lot of people suspect that the Sinhalese will go home once again, and stop supporting demands for accountability and justice, and other grievances held by minorities that have also featured as part of the protests.",

            "article_content": "The Los Angeles mayor's race is turning into a single-issue election: What to do about the city's enormous homeless population? It's not clear either candidate could solve the problem.  RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: We're going to turn our attention to the race for mayor in the city of Los Angeles. Both candidates in the running there are making promises about reducing the city's huge homeless population, more than 41,000 people by last count. But as Anna Scott from member station KCRW reports, those promises might be hard to keep. ANNA SCOTT, BYLINE: Ask anyone on the street in LA what issue they care about most, and chances are you'll hear something like this answer from Adele Wallace. ADELE WALLACE: Everywhere you go, you see tents on the street. It really breaks my heart because it doesn't have to be that way. SCOTT: The two people running to become LA's next mayor say they agree. On one side, Karen Bass, who already represents parts of LA as a U.S. representative. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KAREN BASS: In Los Angeles, we have an absolute emergency with tens of thousands of people sleeping on our streets every night. SCOTT: When Bass talks about solving homelessness, she emphasizes her ties to the Biden administration and the socioeconomic issues behind the crisis. The other contender, Rick Caruso, is a billionaire real estate developer. He talks more to voters who are fed up. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) RICK CARUSO: And then you have the amount of drugs that are on the street, the amount of waste that's on the street, the smell in the area. SCOTT: This is Caruso in an ABC7 news segment. But as different as they sound, there's overlap in what Caruso and Bass say they'll do. They both say they'll make it easier to build new, affordable housing, ask the Biden administration for more low-income rental vouchers, expand the city's shelter system, things outgoing mayor Eric Garcetti says he's done, too. ERIC GARCETTI: I know it's election time, and people should put really bold goals forward, but homelessness isn't going to turn around in a year. SCOTT: Some promises, Garcetti says, like dramatically expanding LA's shelter beds, would cost hundreds of millions of dollars a year. GARCETTI: There's no cavalry. And the mayor of Los Angeles is not some all-powerful being. SCOTT: That's not a great campaign slogan. Still, unhoused advocates say LA's next mayor could do plenty of things better than the current one, like leading LA's 15 city council members, who have 15 different approaches to homelessness. Tommy Newman is a vice president with the United Way of Greater LA. TOMMY NEWMAN: I think that the mayor has a lot of deference to the city council. I've heard both candidates talk about the need for the mayor to push and do more. SCOTT: Yet the economic forces driving homelessness in LA and other large cities are bigger than any mayor, according to Margot Kushel, a physician who directs a homelessness research center at UC San Francisco. MARGOT KUSHEL: The underlying drivers of homelessness are the lack of deeply affordable housing, income inequality and structural racism. It's going to be hard to solve this problem without effort from the federal government. SCOTT: Standing outside the tent she lives in Koreatown, Maria Dimitriou told me what she'd like to ask the mayoral candidates. MARIA DIMITRIOU: This is California. It's one of the richest states in this country. Why is this happening, this homelessness? SCOTT: When she lost her apartment just blocks from here, she had few options. DIMITRIOU: It wasn't because I didn't want to pay my rent or because I was - I fell into drugs or - no. I lost my job. SCOTT: For many voters, the crisis is about much more than tents on sidewalks, says Lora Spangler, who has a home. LORA SPANGLER: I mean, if I didn't own my house and I wasn't an old lady, there was no way in - can I say hell? SCOTT: Oh, yes (laughter). SPANGLER: ...That I would be able to live here, you know?

            "article_content": "NPR's Michel Martin speaks with political scientist Cas Mudde about Sweden's and Italy's electoral results.  MICHEL MARTIN, HOST: Now to Western Europe, where two recent elections show what seems to be the growing force of far-right politics. In Italy, Giorgia Meloni is set to become the country's first female prime minister after her party, The Brothers of Italy, a far-right group with neofascist roots, claimed the greatest percentage of votes in that country's election earlier this week. And in Sweden earlier this month, a far-right group called the Sweden Democrats won big. They received the second highest number of votes in the election after the left-leaning Social Democrats. And while the far-right party won't hold the seat of power, it is widely expected that they will be influential in setting the country's political agenda. But these victories are just the latest in what's become a growing trend in Europe - the resurgence of far-right parties that run on anti-immigrant and nationalist platforms. We wanted to hear more about this and what these victories might mean for European politics more broadly, so we called Cas Mudde. He's a professor of political science at the University of Georgia, where he studies far-right extremism and populism in Europe and the U.S. And he's with us now. Professor Mudde, welcome. Thanks so much for joining us. CAS MUDDE: Thanks for having me. MARTIN: So we should mention at the outset that, you know, obviously, no two countries are the same. Each has a different history and culture that shapes their politics. But for the sake of this conversation, we wanted to talk about the trend that we're seeing across European democracies. So with that being said, what was your reaction to those recent victories that we just mentioned in Sweden and Italy? Was there something in particular that stood out to you? MUDDE: Not really. I see it as kind of a conclusion of a at least two-decade-long process of what is the mainstream normalization of the far-right across Europe. And so if you look at the last election in both countries, you see the trend towards this. But what has shifted is that, for example, the Sweden Democrats, while they won only 3% more, they have now finally become accepted as one of the parties. Similarly, whereas a party like Brothers of Italy about 10 years ago could be popular but would still be seen as outside of the scope, in today's politics in Europe, they are also now acceptable. And that has to do with a right-wing shift in general. On the one hand, extreme right, radical right parties that win more support, but also, mainstream parties that move more towards the positions of these parties. MARTIN: Well, you know, to that point, though, you know, part of the reason that these stick out is that it speaks to a normalization of their politics - right? - and their position. So that's one thing. And the number of votes that these far-right candidates received. But they're not - Italy and Sweden aren't the first in Europe to see, you know, these far-right candidates or these platforms seem to grow strength. So what's the origin story here? Do we know? I mean, I think a lot of people would point to the long civil war in Syria, which, you know, pushed a lot of refugees out of the country and, you know, moving across Europe in search of safety. So do we have a sense of, like, what's the origin story of this in the modern era? MUDDE: Well, you have to go back to the mid-1980s. And so the origin has to do with societal changes. On the one hand, the decrease of the working class, on the other hand, the secularization of population, and then also the effects of mass immigration that we actually saw in the '50s, '60s. But in the 1980s, immigrants and their families became more visible parts of society. And this is to a large extent related to a backlash to a multicultural society as well as a shift towards more inclusion. Now, there was a moment then with 9/11 that the focus on Islam became very strong. And whereas politics used to be purely socioeconomic, now the focus was on identity issues. And then in 2015, '16, the so-called refugee crisis was kind of like a catalyst for these sentiments. So on the one hand, there are specific moments that have pushed the support for the far right, but overall, the process is a very gradual process that has taken now at least four decades. MARTIN: OK. So these are both going to be part of coalition governments where a bunch of parties come together to rule, you know, a country to set its policy agenda. Consensus is usually required. That is the case in Italy and Sweden. There's the idea that in that environment, that the most radical ideas will be mitigated. Is that still true, though? If we're in an environment where, as we said earlier, some of these ideas are being normalized, do we think that's true or do we think it actually goes the other way, that perhaps they then start to move their coalition partners more in their direction? MUDDE: Right. And I think that is the key point here. On the one hand, the radical right has not moderated. On the other hand, the radical right is perceived as less radical today. And the explanation is that the mainstream has moved closer to the radical right, particularly on issues like immigration, integration to a certain extent, minority rights regarding also gender, trans rights, et cetera. And so their most radical ideas will not be implemented. But at the same time, there's no doubt that in both governments there will be a string - a more stringent integration and immigration policy. There will probably be more law and order. There will be a harsher environment for ethnic and potentially also sexual minorities, although less in Sweden than in Italy. So the key point is that the radical right is seen and also treated increasingly as kind of more moderate. But that is a misrepresentation of it. It's not that the radical right moderated it. It is that the mainstream radicalized. MARTIN: So before we let you go, we know that far-right extremist ideas do travel back-and-forth across the Atlantic. I mean, we know this, that, you know, there have been far-right movements in the United States that drew inspiration from extremist views. And in Europe, we know that the reverse is also true, that the racial segregation strategies in the United States were - have been embraced, you know, elsewhere. Right? So since we know that there - and there are certain sort of political figures like Steve Bannon, for example, former President Trump's, you know, close associate, certain media figures here have been embraced. But, you know, in Europe and vice versa, we know that, say, Viktor Orban, for example, spoke at an influential conservative political group in the United States. Since we know that this is - sort of there is this - I don't know how you would call it - a sort of transfer of sort of ideas there. Is there something that Americans should be paying attention to when it comes to looking at what's happening in Europe and how - and our own politics here in the United States, you see what I'm saying? What do you think? MUDDE: Well, I think it's important to note that the U.S. has a very unique political system, and therefore, a lot of the things that happen in Europe will not happen in the U.S. - most notably, coalition formations. And that is a fundamental difference. At the same time, it is clear that within the broader and very radicalized right wing within the U.S., there is much more attention for Europe these days than there ever was. That being said, the U.S. remains relatively parochial and is not going to follow, like, a prime minister of a small country. I think what will be interesting is if Trump or DeSantis or another Republican will come back to the White House. And then there are now much more relationships, personal relationships between people in the broader entourage of the Republican Party and particularly parties like Fidesz from Orban or Meloni, actually, and the Brothers of Italy. And that could lead to some closer relationships. Mostly what people like Orban and Meloni will probably use that for is to find some kind of leverage in their negotiations with the EU. But we are still very far away from an international-like collaboration. And even within the European Union itself, it is important that the radical right remains pretty divided. Even over Russia, for example, where Orban and Meloni, for example, don't see eye to eye at all, and to a certain extent within the coalition of Meloni, there are also more pro-Putin voices and very anti-Putin voices. So the radical right remains, on the one hand, divided. On the other hand, it is growing. And there are more connections than there were before. MARTIN: That's Cas Mudde.

            "article_content": "President Emmanuel Macron will face a runoff against far-right candidate Marine Le Pen, following Sunday's first round of balloting.  LEILA FADEL, HOST: French President Emmanuel Macron is heading into a runoff election with far-right rival Marine Le Pen. The two candidates beat out 10 others in a first round of voting yesterday. And this sets up a rematch for Macron and Le Pen, who faced each other in a presidential runoff five years ago. So what's changed? We go now to NPR's Eleanor Beardsley in Paris. Hi, Eleanor. ELEANOR BEARDSLEY, BYLINE: Hi, Leila. FADEL: So what are the final vote totals this morning? And what about those campaigns led to these results? BEARDSLEY: Right. Well, Macron has 27 1/2 percent of the vote and Marine Le Pen 23 1/2. So it's a four-point spread. It's not a lot. Macron basically didn't run a campaign. He announced that he was, you know, running again very late. And then he was occupied with the war in Ukraine. He even refused to debate ahead of the first round. To the opposite, Marine Le Pen had a very long, solid campaign, and she kept it about bread-and-butter economic issues - purchasing power, the cost of living, which turned out to be the No. 1 concerns of the French. Here's her headquarters, where I was last night, her excited supporters chanting, Marine president. UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE: (Chanting) Marine president, Marine president, Marine president. BEARDSLEY: So she's made her image more moderate, no more fear-mongering talk about immigration and leaving the European Union. In fact, there was another candidate this time around to her right, former TV pundit Eric Zemmour. And he talked about all that. His whole schtick was about French identity and how immigration is ruining France, and Islam is incompatible with French values. So that, too, made her look more mainstream. And she had a unifying message for the French. FADEL: Macron and Le Pen have run against each other before. What's different this time? BEARDSLEY: Well, quite frankly, she has a better chance of winning, say analysts. You know, first of all, the general context - French voters have moved to the right overall, and she's enlarged her base this time around. And like I said, she's a better-prepared candidate. She has a detailed program. She's more moderate. And, you know, even as she lost voters to Zemmour early on, she did not turn nasty. She kept steady on message about economic issues, and she surged in the last weeks. And, Leila, add to this the fact that there's a deep strain of resentment toward Macron amongst voters of all stripes, really, but especially amongst working-class voters. They say he's arrogant. He governs alone. He's been a president of the rich and elites. And he's tone-deaf. And they don't want to give him a second term. FADEL: What about the voters of those other candidates? Who will they support? BEARDSLEY: Well, that's the big question. You know, for Macron, there is no big well of voters to tap into, really, because the mainstream right party, which kind of fell apart five years ago, didn't even get 5% of the votes. And the third-place candidate very close to Le Pen is far-right (ph) leader Jean-Luc Melenchon. Believe it or not, he told his voters not to support the far right, but he didn't go so far as to endorse Macron. And the thing is the far left has a similar socioeconomic platform as the far right. FADEL: Right. BEARDSLEY: You know, they support the working class. They're against big finance and globalization that helps the elites and corporations. And so they also hate Macron, many of them, so they could vote for Le Pen. FADEL: So what's at stake here? BEARDSLEY: Leila, quite a lot. These are two vastly different candidates representing, you know, different voting groups. And they have two completely different visions for the country. If France has a President Le Pen, it's going to be a different country on the world stage. You know, basically, a populist would govern a major European nation. France is, you know, a member of the U.N. Security Council. It has nuclear weapons. It's part of NATO. France would turn inward. She even talked about having border controls with Germany. You know, and we wouldn't be such a close ally with France anymore. She'd renew ties maybe with Russia. I spoke with Martin Quencez. He's head of the Paris office for the German Marshall Fund. And here's what he says about France's relationship with Russia. MARTIN QUENCEZ: Despite the war, Marine Le Pen is still advocating for an alliance with Russia and still considers that it will be possible for her as president to consider Vladimir Putin as an ally. BEARDSLEY: You know, she sort of avoided the war in Ukraine as much as she can. But in these last two intense weeks of campaigning, Macron will make her talk about it. They'll have a debate, and it'll be very intense. Voters will go back to the polls on April 24 to choose between the two. FADEL: NPR's Eleanor Beardsley in Paris. Thank you for your reporting. BEARDSLEY: Thank you, Leila. Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.  All rights reserved.  Visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.

            "article_content": "Tunisia's revolution began when Mohamed Bouazizi set himself on fire in Sidi Bouzid. Morning Edition host Leila Fadel went to the city to ask why the country appears to be losing its democratic gains.  JUANA SUMMERS, HOST: Almost 12 years ago, Tunisians overthrew an autocrat and began building a democracy. But today, rights groups worry that Tunisia is throwing out those gains and heading back to autocracy. This weekend's parliamentary elections could cement that fate. Morning Edition host Leila Fadel returned to the place where Tunisia's revolution began to understand how the country got to this point. LEILA FADEL, BYLINE: So we're in Sidi Bouzid now? SHELBY BEN BRAHIM, BYLINE: Yeah. FADEL: This is central Sidi Bouzid? BEN BRAHIM: This is the center of Sidi Bouzid. That's the portrait of Mohamed Bouazizi on the wall over there. FADEL: That's our Tunisian producer, Shelby Ben Brahim, pointing out a portrait of Mohamed Bouazizi that covers the facade of a building. He's the street vendor who set himself on fire in front of the governor's office on December 17, 2010, after a police officer confiscated his fruit cart. The story goes that before he doused himself in gasoline, he asked, how do you expect me to make a living? His desperate act started a revolution that overthrew a dictator. BEN BRAHIM: That is the exact location here. FADEL: So right in the middle of the street. BEN BRAHIM: Right in the middle of the street, in front of the door. FADEL: Everything started right here. And now maybe everything is destroyed also. The main memorial is erected in a traffic circle called martyrs' square. There's a giant beige replica of the cart taken from him. It's emblazoned with black graffiti - the date Bouazizi set himself on fire and another date, October 13, 2019. BEN BRAHIM: That's the date Kais Saied was elected. And there it is written, ash-shab yurid, which is Kais Saied's slogan. That shows how much hope people had in Kais Saied. FADEL: The political outsider, a retired law professor who ran for president on an anti-corruption platform and won the election by a landslide - people hoped he'd break the political paralysis, the infighting in Parliament and eradicate corruption in the midst of an economic crisis made worse by the pandemic. BEN BRAHIM: There's another thing I have to show you. FADEL: Yeah. BEN BRAHIM: Here it says, Museum of the Revolution. And it has been inaugurated in 2013, but it's just an empty yard inside. Nothing has been done since. So when people in Sidi Bouzid say that they feel neglected by the government, this shows it. FADEL: Today, Sidi Bouzid is still one of the poorest governorates in the country, and unemployment has crept up over the last decade - not just here but across the country. Tunisia is in a socioeconomic crisis that threatens to bankrupt public institutions. It's only deepened by the war in Ukraine, food shortages, soaring energy prices and rising inflation. Now, Saied's wild popularity is waning. In a town on the outskirts of the city, we meet with Wasseem Jday. He leads the province's unemployment association. WASSEEM JDAY: (Non-English language spoken). UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: (Non-English language spoken). FADEL: He takes us to his sister's house for lunch. At 31, like those he tries to help, he can't afford his own home. And he's still single. JDAY: (Through interpreter) It's all connected. I mean, to get married, you need to have a fixed income. You need to have a house. You need to be capable of spending on your families. There's none of this. I have a degree of sports teacher, but I'm unemployed. FADEL: How long have you been unemployed? JDAY: (Through interpreter) Eleven years. FADEL: Thinking about what you wanted in 2011, has any of it become a reality in 2022? JDAY: (Through interpreter) I don't want to say that the situation was better before, but the reality is that the situation has gotten much worse, especially for the youth. We are hopeless. We lost hope. There's nothing in the horizon. FADEL: You know, Tunisia was talked about for the longest time as the bright spot of the uprisings across the Middle East and North Africa, the place where democracy was being built in a real way. But in the last year, people talk about democracy being dead in Tunisia. JDAY: (Through interpreter) It's true that Tunisia is the starting point of - they called Arab Spring. I mean, everything started here. And Tunisia have taken few steps towards democracy and democratic transitions. And then we cannot talk about democracy anymore after what happened on July 25. FADEL: On July 25, 2021, the Tunisian president dissolved the elected Parliament and assumed its powers. JDAY: (Through interpreter) There was a mixture between happiness and fear; fear because we didn't know where are we going? FADEL: And the happiness was? JDAY: (Through interpreter) Because of this change. FADEL: At first, like Jday, most Tunisians were relieved for the Parliament to go. It was paralyzed by infighting and unable to solve the socioeconomic crisis. But then Saied started to sack government ministers, governors, judges and replace them with loyalists. He suspended the 2014 post-revolution Constitution and then replaced it by referendum. And he implemented laws to suppress his critics. JDAY: (Through interpreter) We understood then that we are going into a dictatorship. We had a fear of losing the liberty and freedom that was our only gain since 2011. FADEL: He wanted change, yes, but he didn't want to throw out democracy. And that, he says, is what is happening. The slogan of the revolution was work, dignity and freedom. Do you have work? JDAY: No. FADEL: Do you have freedom? JDAY: No. FADEL: Do you have dignity? JDAY: No. FADEL: Wasseem Jday is boycotting the election. He says he won't co-sign Saied\u2019s power grab. Back in the center of Sidi Bouzid, Iman Gharbi tries to find cheap winter coats for her two children at a used clothes stand. Her husband is out of work, and she's sick with cancer. IMAN GHARBI: (Through interpreter) You cannot even think about how to make money now. All you think about is how to eat. FADEL: But she doesn't blame the president. She blames the years of bad leadership that came before him. GHARBI: (Through interpreter) We have big hopes in our president. We expect him to change things. But people around him don't want him to make change. They're trying to get us angry, as angry as possible so that we get mad at him and tell him to leave. FADEL: What do you want him to change? GHARBI: (Through interpreter) A lot of people who studied and have degrees and don't get work, but those who have money, they pay bribe and get to work. So we want them to fight corruption. FADEL: And then what do you say to people who say he's not democratic, he's putting all the power in his hands? GHARBI: (Through interpreter) No, I think he's very democratic, and he's fighting for the poor ones. And those who claim that he's not democratic are the ones who don't want good stuff for Tunisia. FADEL: She's voting this weekend. We leave Gharbi and head to a cafe nearby. Hi. BAHADINE ENSIRI: Hi. WAJDI NAJI: Hello. FADEL: What's your name? NAJI: My name is Wajdi Naji. FADEL: He's sitting with his friend, Bahadine Ensiri. They're both in their 20s. They're both unemployed, and they're both not voting. Naji describes their life in one repeated sentence. NAJI: (Through interpreter) Wake up, smoke, get drunk, sleep, wake up, smoke, get drunk, sleep - that's our life. It's either we think about migrating illegally or about smuggling some stuff to sell it here into the country. And that's it. FADEL: They say since the revolution, politicians have brought them none of the promises of a better life. And that question that Bouazizi asked on the day he set himself on fire all those years ago - how do you expect me to make a living? - it's still the question so many people ask in his city and his country.

            "article_content": "A quarter century after the end of a brutal civil war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, tensions are once again on the rise and threatening to tear apart the multi-ethnic government.  SCOTT SIMON, HOST: More than a quarter century ago, the U.S. brokered a peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina to end a war that cost about a hundred thousand lives. I covered the siege of Sarajevo. Many of those of us who covered that war will never forget the bitter divisions, brutality and bravery and sacrifice we saw. Now that peace is under threat, and U.S. officials are there to try to help stabilize a country in crisis. NPR's Frank Langfitt is in Sarajevo. Frank, thanks for being with us. FRANK LANGFITT, BYLINE: Thanks for having me, Scott. SIMON: Help us understand what's driving this crisis now. LANGFITT: Yeah, so Bosnia remains divided between Serbs, Croats and Bosnian Muslims. The country has three presidents. One is a guy named Milorad Dodik. He's a Serb. And the Republika Srpska - it's one of two separate government entities. It's majority Serb. And Dodik - he wants the Republika Srpska to have control of troops, oversight of courts. And, again, he's actually threatening to secede from the entire country. And there's a fear here of Bosnia pulling apart and a risk of a return to violence. SIMON: Yeah. Frank, the U.S. invested a tremendous amount of political energy and other kinds of investment into Bosnia, hoping to help build a multi-ethnic, diverse democracy. How is the U.S. government responding? LANGFITT: Well, the Treasury Department has hit Dodik with these economic sanctions, citing corruption. He denies it. But it seems to be an article of faith here - and because of his inflammatory rhetoric. And the U.S. has been sending a steady stream of officials here to apply pressure. The one who's been here most recently is Samantha Power. She's the head of the USAID, which has provided over $2 billion in aid here since the '90s. She met with Dodik yesterday. She emphasized the risks she felt he's creating. He remained defiant. And she says the U.S. is considering even more sanctions. This is what she said when we sat down to talk to her. SAMANTHA POWER: Secessionist threats from President Dodik are extremely unhelpful. They scare people. They make people hearken back to a period that they really had hoped they had left behind. SIMON: Is it a continuation of some of the ethnic rivalry that generated the war, or is there something else involved? LANGFITT: Yeah - yes and no. You know, when you talk to people here, they take a much more cynical view, and they discount that it's really driven by genuine ethnic conflict. They see politicians really exploiting identity politics, try to win elections and basically taking a very cynical approach. I spoke with a professor. His name is Adnan Huskic. And he teaches politics at Sarajevo School of Science and Technology. ADNAN HUSKIC: This crisis are simply the way the local - corrupt local political elites are, in a way, diverting attention away from grave socioeconomic situation we're in and the general misgovernance of this country. SIMON: And, Frank, I know you've been talking to Bosnias, Sarajevans. What do they say? LANGFITT: They hate this crisis right now. And it has led many, many young people - hundreds of thousands - to leave the country in recent years. I mean, it's an astonishing brain drain because they're just giving up because of the corruption, because the lack of opportunity. Yesterday, I met up with Samantha Power when she was talking to a bunch of women who play on a club volleyball team. They're all about 18 years old. Most of them want to go play abroad and stay there if they can. And there was one woman that I talked to. Her name is Amina Mahmutovic (ph). Here's what she had to say. AMINA MAHMUTOVIC: No in Bosnia - I would like to live anywhere else - like, in Europe. LANGFITT: And when you talk to people, they really do say they'd like to - some of them, as much as they love this country, it's become so difficult. They're very happy to try to look somewhere, maybe anywhere else. SIMON: NPR's Frank Langfitt in Sarajevo - thanks so much. LANGFITT: Good to talk, Scott. Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.

A new NPR poll shows President Biden's approval rating is up.  LEILA FADEL, HOST: Ukrainian troops are engaged in counteroffensives in the country's south and east to reclaim more towns and villages occupied by Russian forces. A MART\u00cdNEZ, HOST: That's despite Moscow's recent illegal annexation of the areas. One strategically important town that was recently retaken in the east is Lyman, in the region of Donetsk. The Ukrainian army had nearly encircled thousands of Russian troops there and then drove them out over the weekend. FADEL: NPR's Kat Lonsdorf was in Lyman yesterday, and she joins us now from Dnipro, Ukraine. Good morning. KAT LONSDORF, BYLINE: Hey. Good morning. FADEL: So, Kat, tell us what people you met in Lyman were saying about what it's been like for them. LONSDORF: Yeah. People were really on edge, I will say. A lot of people didn't want to talk on the record. You know, they were worried that the Russians might come back. The fighting is still really close. The towns around there were just completely destroyed. One man I talked to said, you know, this just isn't the time to say anything. And another woman laughed a little and said, first, we have one group in charge and then another, before shrugging and hopping on her bike. But I did talk to one man, 33-year-old Mikhail (ph). He was out riding his motorbike and stopped to talk. And he told me, sure, it's good that the Ukrainians are back in charge, but what they really need is electricity. They've been without it for seven months, he said. And it means that they haven't had any access to any information. So I asked him, did he know that Russian President Vladimir Putin had declared Lyman part of the Russian Federation last week? MIKHAIL: (Non-English language spoken). HANNAH: No, I haven't heard that. LONSDORF: You didn't hear that? HANNAH: (Non-English language spoken). MIKHAIL: (Non-English language spoken). LONSDORF: You can hear my interpreter, Hannah (ph), there. And you can also hear how surprised Mikhail is. He had no idea. He said he hadn't seen any referendum voting. He hadn't even heard about it. FADEL: Wow. So people are really living in the dark. Now, you've said that people are worried the Russian forces could come back. Is that a real concern here? LONSDORF: I've heard that a lot in these recently liberated places but this area especially. You know, it was taken by Russia in 2014, and then the Ukrainian army won it back, only to be taken again in 2020, won back again. You know, and of all the liberated places I've been in, both north of Kyiv and around Kharkiv a few weeks ago, this area in Donetsk seem to have the most signs of Russian influence. I saw copies of the local Russian-language propaganda newspaper sitting around. There was a bus stop painted with the Russian flag, lots and lots of Russian tanks and armored vehicles left behind. And the fighting is still really close. While I was talking to Mikhail, I was in the middle of asking him a question, and there was this big explosion. Did you live here in 2014, when... (SOUNDBITE OF EXPLOSION) LONSDORF: And people around us started ducking, running into their homes. And he just started up his motorbike and said, you know what? I should probably go. And then he looked at me and said, you see; this is how we live. And then he drove off. FADEL: Wow. This is how we live. Well, I'm glad you're safe. But for now, the Ukrainians are making headway in both the east and the south. What are we watching for next? LONSDORF: Well, Putin has been trying to mobilize hundreds of thousands of Russian reinforcements who are supposed to be making their way to the front lines soon. Ukraine is trying to take back as much land as they can before that happens, if that happens. We've been hearing about extremely low morale in those who have been mobilized for Russia and just poor preparation, lack of equipment. And Putin is still saber-rattling about the use of nuclear weapons if Ukraine attacks what he sees as Russian soil, which is how he considers these four regions of Ukraine. Nobody really knows if he's bluffing. But meanwhile, the Ukrainians continue to retake more land. FADEL: NPR's Kat Lonsdorf in Dnipro, Ukraine. Thanks, Kat. LONSDORF: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) FADEL: The World Trade Organization is warning of a sharp slowdown in global trade next year. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) NGOZI OKONJO-IWEALA: The picture for 2023 has darkened considerably. FADEL: That's WTO Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala. MART\u00cdNEZ: A decision on Wednesday by some of the most powerful oil producers around the globe to cut oil production has angered U.S. and European leaders. The move will increase pressure over energy costs for many countries. FADEL: Paul Hannon of The Wall Street Journal joins us now with more context on this economic outlook. Hi, Paul. PAUL HANNON: Hi, Leila. FADEL: So, Paul, let's talk about why the World Trade Organization is warning of a global recession and how much of this is about oil prices now that OPEC+ has decided to reduce oil production. HANNON: Well, the World Trade Organization issued its warning before the OPEC+ decision. But one of the things the WTO was worried about was high energy prices because when the price of essentials like energy and food are very high, households have much less money to spend on other goods, and that means that economic growth more broadly weakens. So the OPEC+ decision makes a global downturn a more likely outcome and will likely keep inflation higher for longer. FADEL: OK, so this is all really hard news for people already struggling with the inflation that's here now. Are there some silver linings? HANNON: I think the silver lining is probably in the inflation outlook. If trade flows are beginning to ease, if the global economy is beginning to cool, that should have an impact on inflation rates, which central banks have been raising their interest rates to contain. There are some indications already that inflation may have peaked at a global level. The global inflation rate has been pretty unchanged since June, although at a really high level. So, yes, there may be some relief on the way, but it's probably going to take quite a few months before people feel a return to a normal kind of level of inflation. FADEL: And what are the biggest challenges for G-7 policymakers as they think about how to deal with this? HANNON: It's a balancing act for them. On the one hand, they've clearly prioritized inflation as their, you know, enemy No. 1. This is the thing that economic policymakers need to get on top of for fear of a repeat of what happened in the 1970s. On the other hand, rising interest rates, do, you know, eat into household budgets. They do lead to higher mortgage payments, higher payments on loans of all kinds. So that can sort of double-down on the hardship that households feel and potentially make any recession deeper. FADEL: Paul Hannon of The Wall Street Journal. Thanks, Paul. HANNON: You're welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) FADEL: President Biden's approval ratings have risen to 44%, according to a new NPR/Marist poll out today. MART\u00cdNEZ: Democrats could hear that as good news. However, voters also say inflation is the most important issue ahead of next month's midterms. FADEL: Joining us now to discuss the poll is NPR senior political editor and correspondent Domenico Montanaro. Good morning, Domenico. DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Good morning. Great to be here. FADEL: So what are some of the big takeaways here? MONTANARO: Well, you noted Biden's improvement there. I mean, back in July, he'd bottomed out at 36%. And that's been steadily on the rise since then. Gas prices have been declining. Democrats have gotten some legislative wins. And the president's really been out there more, touting some of those things. And the improvement, you know, is coming from base Democrats mostly and also independents. Both groups had really not been very excited about his presidency to that point. Now, being in the low to mid 40s for approval rating is not exactly great for an incumbent party. And remember, the president's party usually loses a significant number of seats in a president's first midterm, historically, as it is. But this will stop at least some of the nail-biting I've been hearing from Democratic strategists about just how much their candidates need to overperform the president, which is a pretty hard thing to do. FADEL: Now, we're just weeks away from the midterms, where turnout has traditionally been low. Is that likely to be the case this time around? MONTANARO: Well, lower than a presidential election, for sure, but signs are pointing to high turnout, actually, for a midterm. For example, there seems to be very high enthusiasm from both Republicans and Democrats. More than 8 in 10 registered voters who responded in this survey say they definitely intend to vote - might not be that high, but that's pretty high to be saying that they will. Republicans slightly higher than Democrats, but that's to be expected, but not really by a lot. And the groups, though, that are the least enthusiastic about voting this fall are Black voters and young voters who, of course, are pillars of the Democratic base. So a warning sign there for Democrats. Some of this, though, cuts across party lines when you look at enthusiasm and is more about socioeconomics. The people who say they're most interested in these elections are college-educated whites and baby boomers, older voters. Among the least interested, in addition to young voters and Black voters, are people making less than $50,000 a year, parents of children under 18, those who live in small towns and those without college degrees. There's a pretty substantial gap here, by the way, between women without college degrees and men without them. Women without degrees say they have much less interest in this election. Meanwhile, the converse is true for women with degrees, who are among the most likely to vote. FADEL: Now, during this cycle, Democrats have really focused on the Supreme Court's abortion decision, while Republicans have hammered them on inflation and crime. How are these issues resonating with voters? MONTANARO: Well, abortion is certainly up there for Democrats in particular. It's certainly a big motivating issue for them. It's second, Democrats say, behind preserving democracy for them. But as you noted, inflation remains a top issue. And that's true of independents, who are so key in swing districts, and of course, for Republicans. But even Gen Zers and millennials, who are also among the most likely to approve of the job Biden's doing and want a Democrat elected to Congress, also say that inflation's their top issue, too. Lots of swing-district democrats have been arguing that the party can't put all of its eggs in a one-issue basket but also need to make the case on the economy as well. You know, it's a lot easier to motivate people with anger and fear. And the ones angry about inflation right now, frankly, are Republicans, and undoubtedly, Democrats and many independents are angry about abortion rights no longer being guaranteed. So these are likely still to remain much of the focus in this election and where we're seeing millions of dollars being spent. FADEL: NPR's Domenico Montanaro. Thanks so much. MONTANARO: You're welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) FADEL: Police in Thailand say more than 30 people have been killed in a shooting at a day care center in the northeast of the country. NPR's Michael Sullivan reports. MICHAEL SULLIVAN, BYLINE: Details of the tragic event remain sketchy, but police say that many children are among the dead. Authorities say the man who carried out the attack was a former police officer who burst into the day care center in Nongbua Lamphu and began firing. Police say the man later killed his wife and child before killing himself. Mass shootings are rare in Thailand, but the rate of gun ownership in the country is higher than in many other countries in the region, augmented by large numbers of illegal weapons smuggled in across porous borders. The last mass shooting here occurred in 2020, when a soldier, angry over a property deal that went bad, killed more than two dozen people at an army base and, later, a mall. FADEL: That was NPR's Michael Sullivan in Thailand. And NPR will be following this story throughout the day. Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "Twelve states have declined to expand Medicaid for low-income Americans. In South Dakota, 53% of voters support changing that, according to a recent South Dakota State University poll.\n                \n                    \n                    Riley Bunch/GPB\n                    \n                \nhide caption Twelve states have declined to expand Medicaid for low-income Americans. In South Dakota, 53% of voters support changing that, according to a recent South Dakota State University poll. About four years ago, Cecelia \"Biz\" Spotted Tail felt a lump growing in her lower belly. \"I know something's wrong, I know my body,\" she says. \"I couldn't lay on my stomach because I kept feeling that ball.\" Spotted Tail, 53, lives in South Dakota, where she has raised five kids on the Rosebud Indian Reservation. After working in mental health services for many years, she recently started a small business, a flower farm called Bizzie's Bees. Spotted Tail says it took months for an Indian Health Service gynecologist to take her concerns seriously. By the time she would get it removed, the benign tumor inside her uterus weighed 8 pounds. She wanted a minimally invasive surgery. It cost $54,000. She had no health insurance. Expanding health coverage for hundreds of thousands of uninsured Americans is a driving issue in some statewide campaigns this election. South Dakota is one of 12 states that has not expanded Medicaid coverage after the Affordable Care Act increased how many low-income Americans could qualify. Next month, voters will decide whether to amend the state's constitution to do that. In other states, Democratic candidates for governor are promising to expand Medicaid and hammering Republican incumbents for not having done so already. Spotted Tail's experience speaks to challenges within IHS and also to the struggles many uninsured Americans face. IHS receives so little funding that it often cannot afford to pay for expensive treatments off the reservation unless it is to save a life or limb. After Spotted Tail pleaded with IHS administrators, she says they agreed to pay for her surgery. But the experience spurred her to become one of the faces of the campaign to expand Medicaid in South Dakota. Research from other states shows expansion can increase health care resources across all patients who belong to tribal nations. If successful, South Dakota will be the latest in a string of states where ballot measures have bypassed mostly GOP-led state governments in order to expand Medicaid. \"South Dakota is such a rural state, it can be difficult to get to a doctor under any circumstances. If you're uninsured, you're just going to put off receiving that care,\" says Zach Marcus, campaign manager for South Dakotans Decide Healthcare, a group backing the amendment. It receives funding from hospital systems and health-focused non-profits, according to the campaign finance watchdog site Open Secrets. If successful, Amendment D would extend publicly funded insurance to 42,500 South Dakotans, according to a legislative analysis. Currently, a single parent of two must make less than $10,590 a year to get Medicaid in South Dakota, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. That's well below the federal poverty line. The amendment would raise that cutoff to nearly $32,000. While some business groups have endorsed the measure, Republicans in the state legislature have lined up against it. \"I don't think more welfare in South Dakota is going to make it stronger. Putting [Medicaid expansion] in the constitution is way past ridiculous,\" state Sen. Lee Shoenbeck told South Dakota Public Broadcasting earlier this year. Texas has the highest rate of residents without health insurance in the United States. Democratic candidate Beto O'Rourke is running to oust Governor Greg Abbott, and has used ads like this one to highlight their different stances on Medicaid expansion. In Texas, 771,000 residents live below the poverty line but still make too much to qualify for Medicaid, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Democratic candidate for governor Beto O'Rourke has slammed incumbent Gov. Greg Abbott for failing to extend coverage to these constituents, pointing to the tens of billions of dollars in federal subsidies for expansion the state has turned down. The O'Rourke campaign is even running a 30-second television spot featuring a trauma surgeon, called simply \"Expand Medicaid.\" Abbott called Medicaid \"broken and bloated\" back in 2015 and has not waivered in his opposition to expanding the program. In Georgia, Stacey Abrams, the Democratic nominee for governor, has attacked Gov. Brian Kemp for his support of a narrower from of expansion. \"He has decided that half a million Georgians don't deserve to wake up and take care of themselves and their families,\" Abrams told supporters while speaking at a campaign event this summer. Under Kemp, Georgia is implementing a policy that would make a smaller number of state residents, about 50,000, eligible for Medicaid if they follow work requirements. In both states, polling shows a majority of voters support expanding Medicaid. North Carolina Senate leader Phil Berger, a longtime Medicaid expansion opponent, has changed his position.\n                \n                    \n                    Gary Robertson/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption North Carolina Senate leader Phil Berger, a longtime Medicaid expansion opponent, has changed his position. Even if Democrats flip these governors' offices, they will need Republican support to fulfill their campaign promise. In Kansas, incumbent Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly has vowed, if reelected, to attempt to expand Medicaid for the fifth time. Her challenger, GOP state Attorney General Derek Schmidt, opposes expansion because it does not include a work requirement, his spokesperson told the Kansas Reflector. Support for the policy is nearly unanimous among Democrats \u2013 and high among Republicans \u2013 so it makes sense Democrats want to use it to woo voters, says Jamila Michener, an associate professor at Cornell University who researches Medicaid and politics. \"Elected officials ... should not be able to ignore the preferences and needs of their constituents,\" she says. That popularity also means partisan opposition is eroding, says Adam Searing, an associate professor at Georgetown University who has advised states on Medicaid expansion. He points to Republicans in North Carolina recently coming out in favor of expansion. \"They were reading the political tea leaves,\" says Searing.",

The 70-year-old farmer in the Brazilian Amazon has just set fire to 5 acres of rainforest that he will convert into cattle pasture. Torching the jungle is illegal but as Costa moves through his plot, clearing away charred underbrush with a machete, he just shrugs. \"I've been fined three times\" for deforestation, Costa says. \"But it's a joke.

That's an area larger than Maryland. Environmentalists and political analysts chalk up the damage to two main factors. Bolsonaro, they say, has encouraged more farming, ranching and mining in the Amazon while at the same time slashing the budgets and staff of government agencies tasked with protecting the jungle and stopping deforestation.

Fires dotted the landscape. At times, massive clouds of gray smoke partially obscured the sun. Black specks of ash fluttered down from the sky.

What's more, Fearnside and other experts say that it's a common practice for land speculators to pay squatters to occupy their properties and clear away the jungle for ranching and large-scale farming. In fact, deforesting can double property prices, says Rose Marcondes, 45, as she keeps an eye on the fire burning on her plot of land just off the highway. Still, when it comes to destroying the Amazon, she claims that small farmers like herself are not the main culprits.

But Bolsonaro, a former army captain who has ironically referred to himself as \"Captain Chainsaw,\" views the Amazon as a source of jobs and economic growth and has encouraged people to settle there. Eduardo Taveira, the top environmental official for Amazonas state, which includes most of the Brazilian rainforest, says one goal is to create badly needed jobs. In the Amazon, he tells NPR, \"more than 50% of all the population lives below the poverty line. So it's not just environmental issues\" that need to be addressed. Bolsonaro is also backing several draft bills in Congress that would give property titles to Amazon land invaders, allow mining on Indigenous lands and make it easier to secure environmental licenses for mining and large-scale farming in the Amazon.

Most polls show Bolsonaro \u2014 a climate-change skeptic who once accused environmental groups of setting fire to the Amazon to embarrass his government \u2014 trailing front-runner Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva by double digits. Da Silva is a former two-term president who has pledged to preserve the Amazon. Speaking to foreign correspondents in August, da Silva vowed to create a ministry for Indigenous peoples, clamp down on illegal gold miners who have invaded Indigenous lands under Bolsonaro and rebuild Brazil's main environmental protection agency, known as Ibama.

The worst part of the job, says volunteer Pablo Carvalho, is coming across so many dead birds, snakes and other critters. Fire chief Jo\u00e3o Filho admits that it's frustrating that so many jungle arsonists get off scot-free. He can't dwell on it, however, because he's too busy trying to save whatever patches of jungle he can. \"We put out one fire but then the ashes from that fire drift down and start another fire,\" he says. \"It never ends.\" A woman observes a massive fire in the Amazon rainforest near the BR 319 highway on Tuesday.\n                \n                    \n                    Bruno Kelly for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption A woman observes a massive fire in the Amazon rainforest near the BR 319 highway on Tuesday.",

            "article_content": "After record deforestation and environmental deregulation in the past few years, the result of the Brazilian election could very well determine the fate of the Amazon rainforest.  JUANA SUMMERS, HOST: Brazilians go to the polls Sunday to decide rather to - whether to give their right-wing president, Jair Bolsonaro, another four-year term. Bolsonaro has spent the past four years encouraging logging, mining and ranching in the Amazon rainforest, and this has led to record deforestation. More than 13,000 square miles of jungle have been lost, and that is an area larger than the state of Maryland. NPR's John Otis has been traveling through the Amazon and filed this report. JOHN OTIS, BYLINE: So we're seeing a big black plume of smoke rising into the sky, so we're going to stop and check it out. After driving just a few hours into the jungle, we spot our first fire. (SOUNDBITE OF FIRE CRACKLING) OTIS: Farmers and ranchers are torching the land to clear it of trees and underbrush. It looks like a couple of acres have burned up already, and there's nobody watching over this, so this thing could spread. Suddenly, the fire gets a lot louder as flames shoot to the top of palm trees. (SOUNDBITE OF FIRE HISSING) OTIS: Back in our truck, translator Monica Prestes and I have a hard time keeping track of all the fires. So this looks like two fires. Oh, there's one on the other side of the road, too. MONICA PRESTES: The color of the sky changed. It's gray now. We can no longer see the blue sky. (SOUNDBITE OF FIRE CRACKLING) OTIS: Until recently, Brazilian governments tried to clamp down on rainforest destruction. But since taking office in 2019, President Bolsonaro has incited it by promoting cattle ranching, gold mining and agro-industry in the Amazon. Eduardo Taveira, the top environmental official for Amazonas State, which includes most of the jungle, says the goal is to create badly needed jobs. EDUARDO TAVEIRA: More than 50% of all the population are living below the line of the poverty. So it's not just about environmental issues that you're talking about. OTIS: But there's been a free-for-all of deforestation. Meanwhile, Bolsonaro has gutted the environmental agencies tasked with preventing it, says Philip Fearnside of Brazil's National Institute of Amazonian Research. PHILP FEARNSIDE: It sends a message to people who are at the front lines deforesting and so forth that they can violate any environmental laws they want, and later on all will be forgiven. OTIS: Indeed, during our four days driving through the jungle, we're unable to find a single police officer or park ranger taking action to stop the destruction. (SOUNDBITE OF CHAINS RATTLING) OTIS: We do come across numerous road maintenance crews, but their work makes it easier for newcomers to move into the jungle. (SOUNDBITE OF BRANCHES BEING CHOPPED) OTIS: Many, like Douval Costa, equate scorched earth with progress. He's just finished burning five acres of jungle to make way for a herd of cattle. DOUVAL COSTA: Two days ago. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Oh, really? COSTA: Two, two, two. OTIS: He freely admits that what he's doing is illegal. COSTA: (Speaking Portuguese). OTIS: In fact, Costa has been ticketed three times for chopping down the jungle. But he shrugs and says, nobody around here ever bothers to pay environmental fines. (SOUNDBITE OF BRANCHES BEING CHOPPED) OTIS: However, the situation could change soon. Ahead of Sunday's election, polls show Bolsonaro trailing Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. He's a former two-term president who has pledged to preserve the Amazon. (SOUNDBITE OF FIRE CRACKLING) OTIS: In the meantime, settlers here are rushing to raze the jungle while they still can. One farmer has only been here a month but has already cleared 30 acres. UNIDENTIFIED FARMER: (Speaking Portuguese). OTIS: Shirtless and lying in a hammock, he claims to be opening up space to plant pineapples and coconuts. But there's a for sale sign out front, and it's common practice for speculators here to pay people to live on their land and burn the jungle, which actually raises property values. UNIDENTIFIED FIREFIGHTER: (Non-English language spoken). OTIS: As our trip winds down, we finally spot some people trying to stop the destruction - a team of firefighters. JOAO FILHO: (Speaking Portuguese). OTIS: Fire Chief Joao Filho admits that it's frustrating to see so many jungle arsonists get off scot-free, but he doesn't dwell on it. He's too busy saving whatever patches of rainforest he can. John Otis, NPR News, the Amazon Rainforest, Brazil. Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Petro is polling first ahead of the May 29 election. BOGOT\u00c1, Colombia \u2014 Gustavo Petro, a former left-wing guerrilla and the front-runner in Colombia's presidential election next month, is promising to shake up Colombian society. And to be sure, there's a lot that needs changing. About 40% of Colombians live below the poverty line and the country has one of the world's largest gaps between rich and poor, according to the World Bank. \"If we continue along this same path, the country will fall into the abyss,\" Petro said in a recent interview with NPR. \"People are disillusioned, which is why I am at the top of the polls.\" An opposition senator who is now in his third run for the presidency, Petro, 62, has spent his whole life challenging the status quo. He grew up in Zipaquir\u00e1, a mining town just north of Bogot\u00e1, where he was dismayed by its poverty. But for decades, government repression as well as a power-sharing pact between traditional parties made it extremely difficult for leftists to break into politics. That's why in 1978, Petro joined the April 19 Movement, or M-19, one of several Colombian rebel groups that formed in the wake of Fidel Castro's revolution in Cuba. His rebel nom de guerre, \"Aureliano,\" was inspired by a fictional military officer constantly fighting losing battles in the novel One Hundred Years of Solitude by Colombian writer Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez. The M-19 carried out kidnappings, bank robberies and a disastrous 1985 siege of the Supreme Court that led to more than 90 deaths. But initially, the M-19 cultivated a Robin Hood image by assaulting supermarket trucks and distributing stolen milk in city slums. Petro's main job was to stockpile stolen weapons and in 1985 was briefly imprisoned and tortured by the army. After his release, he also helped organize guerrilla cells in the cities and the impoverished countryside. M-19 rebels carry the coffin of Mayor Afranio Parra, days after he was killed by police on April 7, 1989, in Colombia's Santo Domingo mountains before a burial ceremony. M-19 was one of several Colombian leftist guerrilla groups.\n                \n                    \n                    Esly Salinas/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption M-19 rebels carry the coffin of Mayor Afranio Parra, days after he was killed by police on April 7, 1989, in Colombia's Santo Domingo mountains before a burial ceremony. M-19 was one of several Colombian leftist guerrilla groups. \"I slept in the homes of poor farmers,\" he said in the interview, speaking via Zoom. \"I hiked across mountains and Indigenous reserves. I was in daily contact with poor people.\" Petro believes such close contact with average Colombians eventually made him a better politician. \"I think a president should have these types of experiences,\" he said. He would soon focus on electoral politics. Disillusioned with the war, Petro took part in peace talks that paved the way for the M-19 to disarm and form a left-wing political party in 1990. However, running for office remained risky. Carlos Pizarro, who had been the M-19's top commander, ran for president in 1990 but was shot dead by an anti-communist gunman weeks before the vote. A month earlier, another leftist presidential candidate, Bernardo Jaramillo, was assassinated. Petro surrounded himself with body guards and made his way into politics. He served nearly two decades in Colombia's Congress, where he earned praise for denouncing close ties between politicians and right-wing death squads. He finished fourth in the 2010 presidential election, then was elected mayor of the capital, Bogot\u00e1, in 2011. It was a chaotic four years in charge of the capital. Although crime and poverty fell, Petro went through nine chiefs of staff and, at one point, trash piled high in the streets during his bungled attempt to reform the city's garbage pickup. In 2018, Petro again ran for president, losing to conservative Iv\u00e1n Duque. But under President Duque, drug-related violence has increased in rural areas, a national strike shut down major cities last year, and poverty has swelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. (The Colombian Constitution bars the president from seeking a second consecutive term.) \"The government's lack of capacity to deal with a national emergency just left a lot of people angry and upset. And I think that's what gives Gustavo Petro a real chance,\" says Sergio Guzm\u00e1n, director of the consulting firm Colombia Risk Analysis. Another factor opening the door for Petro is a more recent peace agreement, signed in 2016, that disarmed Colombia's largest rebel group known as the FARC. As the country's guerrilla conflicts have faded, Guzm\u00e1n says, voters have become more willing to support leftist politicians who were previously viewed by some as rebels in disguise. Should Petro win, he would become Colombia's first-ever left-wing president. Many of his proposals have alarmed the country's business class. Petro talks of raising taxes on the rich \u2014 and printing money \u2014 to pay for anti-poverty programs. To move toward a greener economy, he promises to stop all new oil exploration and to cut back on coal production, even though these are Colombia's two top exports. \"The fiscal accounts of Colombia depend on oil. It's as simple as that,\" Alberto Bernal, a Colombian economist, said on a video panel this month sponsored by the Council of the Americas think tank in New York. \"What is Colombia going to do if you can't take oil out?\" Petro has outlined a 12-year transition period and says the country could replace the lost income from fossil fuels with a major boost to tourism, and improvements in agriculture and industry. \"I am proposing a path that is much better for Colombia,\" Petro told NPR, adding that his plan adheres to guidelines from last year's United Nations Climate Change Conference in Glasgow.

The country's efforts in the U.S.-led war on drugs have played a key role in Colombia's close relationship with Washington. He also spoke in the interview of forging a new relationship with Washington. Petro is a strong critic of the U.S.-led war on illegal drugs in the Andean region \u2014 though he provided no specific alternatives \u2014 and he wants to renegotiate a 2006 bilateral trade deal that he claims has hurt Colombian farmers and manufacturers. He also wants more help from the U.S. to protect the Amazon rainforest, part of which lies in Colombia. Since giving up on guerrilla warfare more than three decades ago, Petro has followed the democratic rules yet critics continue to question his commitment to liberal democracy. For example, Petro commented on the campaign trail that his first act as president would be to declare a state of economic emergency, allowing him to bypass Congress and enact laws by decree to tackle hunger and poverty. Petro has also insulted journalists and recently called a Colombian TV commentator who questioned his plans a \"neo-Nazi.\" Federico Guti\u00e9rrez, a conservative former Medell\u00edn mayor who is Petro's main rival in the presidential race, did some name-calling of his own. In a March TV debate, he compared Petro to socialist leaders who have brought authoritarian rule and economic ruin to neighboring Venezuela.

He also said a Petro administration would expropriate private businesses, a claim Petro denied. An April 21 poll gave Petro 38% of the vote \u2014 well ahead of the seven other candidates competing in the May 29 election. But that's below the 50% plus one vote he would need to avoid a June runoff between the two top vote-getters from the first round. Arlene Tickner, a professor of international relations at Rosario University in Bogot\u00e1, chalks up some of the criticism of Petro to a Colombian upper class that's running scared. \"They stand to lose some of their privileges, as should be in a genuine democracy that values equality and participation,\" Tickner says. \"Remember that Colombia is one of most unequal countries in Latin America and in the world and it's shameful that we have not yet had a more progressive president.\" A large image of Francia M\u00e1rquez is projected on a screen as she and presidential candidate Gustavo Petro stand on stage during a campaign event, March 23.

His running mate, Francia M\u00e1rquez, is an Afro-Colombian human rights activist who, if elected, would make history by becoming the country's first-ever Black vice president. Indeed, Petro's political movement is called the Historic Pact \u2014 which Guzm\u00e1n, the consultant, calls \"a brilliant bit of political communication, because: Who campaigns against history?\"",

That percentage is even higher among residents in District 2,  just east of campus, explains Mariah Parker, better known to some as the hip-hop artist Linqua Franqa. With a new album out, titled Bellringer, Parker is hoping to make change in their community \u2014 both by extending their reach as an artist and coming into their own as a public office holder. A self-described \"outcast weirdo band kid,\" Parker grew up outside of Louisville, Ky., listening to rap but not always hearing themselves reflected in the music. They participated in poetry slams at Warren Wilson College in  Swannanoa, N.C., but wished the scene was more open and inclusive. Parker says when they moved to Athens in 2013, the creative community was robust, but not unified. \"Every single person I met was a bassist or a vocalist or a keyboardist, or had a show this Thursday \u2013 'Can you come?'\" they recall. \"But I noticed its lack of color. All of the rappers were relegated to the corners of the city, both musically and geographically.\" So Parker started organizing hip-hop showcases downtown, centering Black artists. When one of the headliners was unable to make it to a show, Parker stepped up to the mic themselves. Performing as \"Lingua Franca\" (the spelling was later changed to Linqua Franqa), Parker rapped about public policies and personal struggles, connecting their experiences to social inequality and the need for change. \"The music was a touchstone for conversations around why things are the way they are,\" Parker explains. \"Let's have a talk. Does it have to be that way? What can we do?\" Linqua Franqua performs \"Con And The Can\" at Athens' city hall. Ethnomusicologist Kyra Gaunt says that while Parker's music addresses current issues, it also sustains traces of African ideologies about individuality within collectivity, which also inform hip-hop's origins. Gaunt explains that \"music was of the people, and it spoke about the plight of everyday life.\" Parker began to see the showcases bring people together, coalescing around the progressive messaging in the music, and decided to take things a step further. They started hosting crash courses in civic engagement in music clubs across the city, coming to shows with a backpack full of information on upcoming legislation, pre-stamped postcards and advice about how to effectively engage with elected officials. Parker explains, \"it started to slowly morph into a more explicitly political form of organizing.\" That organizing picked up in the wake of the 2016 election, with a wave of young people in Georgia and across the country increasingly identifying as progressives. When local hip-hop artist and activist Tommy Valentine launched his campaign for Athens-Clarke's District 9 County Commissioner in 2017, Parker was his manager. Athens Mayor Kelly Girtz, who was running for office in the same election cycle, recalls being deeply impressed by Parker's unique skill set. \"While Mariah certainly has a performer's element, there's also a distinct authenticity,\" he says. So, when the commissioner representing Parker's East Athens district announced that he was stepping down to pursue his own mayoral bid, Girtz encouraged Parker to run for the vacated seat. A 26-year-old political novice, they were busy with a burgeoning music career and academic work as a doctoral student at the University of Georgia. Parker had been joking about life-work balance when they told a local music reporter that their life was in shambles. But then Parker considered that their district had been represented by the same commissioner for 25 years. He had run unopposed for most of his tenure, and it was presumed his successor would, too. Parker says hecklers came to their early 2018 campaign launch, reciting the quote they gave to the music reporter, stripped out of context. \"So I was straight up with them. There are hundreds if not thousands of people in our district that are behind on their car payments, that are going to eat ramen today, that could find themselves unhoused next week if they get into another fight with their husband.\" Running on a platform of racial and economic justice, Parker won. They made national headlines when they were sworn into office, standing beside their mother, both of their hands placed on the Autobiography of Malcolm X, who Parker sees as an example of fearlessness and flexibility. Parker was sworn in as District 2 county commissioner on a copy of the Autobiography of Malcolm X, next to their mother.\n                \n                    \n                    Raphaela Aleman\n                    \n                \nhide caption Parker was sworn in as District 2 county commissioner on a copy of the Autobiography of Malcolm X, next to their mother. Now serving in their second term as District 2's county commissioner, Parker says they're prioritizing new models of economic development \u2014 like investing in job-training programs and supporting local minority- owned businesses \u2014  to support communities where, despite high levels of employment, wages aren't high enough to lift people out of poverty. Affordable housing is another concern, they say, as the District's proximity to the University of Georgia has put the squeeze on low-income renters. Parker says one of their proudest accomplishments is the 2021 passage of the Linnentown Resolution. When the University of Georgia set out to expand its campus in the early 1960s, the homes of about 50 Black families were razed to build new dorms. Former residents remembered the demolition and the displacement they suffered, but there was no formal acknowledgement until 2019, when a University of Georgia Libraries staff member uncovered a trove of documents pertaining to \"Urban Renewal Project GA. R-50.\" That discovery was the starting point for The Linnentown Project, a public awareness campaign based on archival research and documentation. Although the University of Georgia disputed some of the findings, Mayor Girtz and the Athens-Clarke County Commission issued a public apology and issued calls for reinvestment in the community, led by the community. As they lead change as an elected official, Parker also spends a lot of time working with kids in local schools and no-cost summer camps, using freestyle rap and language play to support literacy and civic engagement efforts. Their new album, Bellringer, doubles as a Ph.D. dissertation in Language and Literacy at the University of Georgia. Parker says the title has two meanings. \"Both in the sense of knocking somebody out, and calling people to action.\" For Parker, those calls center on issues such as police brutality, social media addiction, mental health, anti-capitalism and labor organizing. One song, \"Abolition,\" features a guest spot from political activist and scholar Angela Davis, who met Parker in 2020 at a conference and stayed in touch. Davis says she considers art, in all its forms, central to the success of social justice movements. \"Art helps us to feel what we do not yet understand,\" she explains. \"My mentor Herbert Marcuse once pointed out that art itself doesn't change the world, but art changes the people and can give them impulses to go out and transform the world. I think that Mariah Parker totally understands this. I love that they perform under the name 'Linqua Franqa,' because it's about creating a new language.\"",

            "article_content": "A federal program intended to help low-income student loan borrowers, and eventually offer them debt cancellation, has failed to live up to its promise, an NPR investigation has found. More than 9 million borrowers are currently enrolled in income-driven repayment (IDR) plans, which are designed to help people who cannot afford to make large monthly payments. The plans also promise loan cancellation after 20-25 years. But documents obtained by NPR offer striking evidence that these plans have been badly mismanaged by loan servicers and the U.S. Department of Education. NPR obtained two-dozen pages of internal department documents, including emails and, most notably, a previously unreported, 2016 review of student loan servicers' struggles to implement IDR. The documents shed new light on the 2021 revelation that, at the time, 4.4 million borrowers had been repaying for at least 20 years but only 32 had had loans canceled under IDR. The documents also offer surprising new revelations. For example, some servicers weren't clearly tracking IDR payments and did not know when borrowers qualified for cancellation. In all, these records paint a breathtaking picture of IDR's failure, and cast a shadow over the federal student loan program. While the Biden administration did not make these problems, it must now address them as it weighs restarting repayment after a two-year pandemic pause. In response to NPR's request for comment, an Education Department spokesperson said on Friday, \"Borrowers place their trust in us to make sure these plans work the way they were intended to, and we intend to honor that trust. We are aware of historical issues with prior processes that had undermined accurate tracking of eligible payments. The current situation is unacceptable and we are committed to addressing those issues.\" The Education Department offers several IDR plans that make similar promises: a manageable monthly payment (as low as $0) as well as loan cancellation after 20-25 years of qualifying payments. It is the servicer's job to count how many payments a borrower has made and proactively notify them when they qualify for loan cancellation (after 240-300 payments). But the previously unreleased 2016 review of servicers, conducted by the department's office of Federal Student Aid (FSA), found that three servicers \u2014 PHEAA, CornerStone and MOHELA \u2014 did \"not have an IDR forgiveness payment counter\" to track borrowers' progress toward cancellation. The review notes that borrowers with accounts at PHEAA, for example, would have had to request a manual count of past payments to gauge their eligibility for cancellation. It is not on borrowers to be keeping two decades' worth of records of how their student loan payments were made and whether each payment counted towards cancellation. Abby Shafroth of the National Consumer Law Center Ultimately, this means some servicers didn't know if borrowers qualified for cancellation unless they were asked, by borrowers, to do a labor-intensive records review. \"It is not on borrowers to be keeping two decades' worth of records of how their student loan payments were made and whether each payment counted towards cancellation,\" says Abby Shafroth, an attorney at the National Consumer Law Center (NCLC), a nonprofit that has previously called for reform of IDR. The review's executive summary makes clear the department had long harbored worries about its servicers breaking the promise of IDR, noting \"concern regarding the accuracy of the payment counters with our servicers has been on FSA's radar for some time.\" As such, Shafroth says, the Education Department also deserves blame. After all, Congress created the first income-based plans back in the early '90s. \"It appears that [the Education Department] waited until the 20 years were up [and IDR borrowers were becoming eligible for debt cancellation] and then said, 'Oh, we should probably make sure that the servicers are counting payments,' \" Shafroth says. \"The department could have avoided this mess if [it] had done its job,\" says Rep. Virginia Foxx, the top Republican on the House education committee. \"Year after year after year, Republicans and servicers have pressed the department to provide clear and concise guidance for how to manage this complex web of repayment plans, but the department has refused to do that.\" The documents also reveal other irregularities in how servicers count IDR payments. For example, if a monthly payment of $100.01 is owed but a borrower pays just $100 \u2014 one penny shy of the required amount \u2014 three servicers (Great Lakes, Nelnet and Edfinancial) said they would still count it as a qualifying payment. But four others indicated they would not. These internal documents reveal that servicers' mismanagement of IDR is especially harmful for borrowers with the lowest incomes. Under IDR, a monthly payment of $0 for a borrower earning less than 150% of the federal poverty line should still count toward loan cancellation. But in the same 2016 review, officials warned, these $0 IDR payments \"that qualify for forgiveness are not adequately tracked.\" The documents do not explain \"adequately\" or the reason for the apparent failure. \"That is one of the most concerning things that you've highlighted because the people with the $0 payments are the folks in financial distress,\" says Persis Yu of the Student Borrower Protection Center. \"If that payment is not tracked adequately, it means that they're in debt that they don't owe. And to build a system in which we utterly fail the lowest income borrowers so explicitly is just inexcusable.\" Nearly half of all IDR borrowers are making $0 monthly payments, according to a 2019 analysis by the Center for American Progress (CAP). Not adequately tracking those payments could delay or derail millions of the lowest-income borrowers on their way to loan cancellation. Loading... \"We knew there was a problem,\" says Rep. Bobby Scott, the top Democrat on the House education committee. \"This is worse than we expected.\" Scott had requested a U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) investigation into IDR's failings. The results of that GAO review are expected later this month. \"The idea that you haven't counted certain payments is disturbing,\" Scott says. And that's not the only failure hitting the system's most vulnerable borrowers. When borrowers default, their loans are transferred from a traditional student loan servicer to a new servicer that specializes in helping borrowers rehabilitate their loans. But, these documents show, when borrowers return to good standing and to a traditional servicer, they also lose any record of qualifying IDR payments made prior to default. To build a system in which we utterly fail the lowest income borrowers so explicitly is just inexcusable. Persis Yu of the Student Borrower Protection Center This loss of past payment credit happens not because those payments no longer count (they do) \u2014 but because the technology is deeply flawed. \"That's horrible,\" says Beth Akers, who studies student loans at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute (AEI). \"There needs to be a safety net there. So let education work to allow people to, quote unquote, pull themselves up by their bootstraps. But when those bootstraps break or they're not there, let's make sure that there is something to catch them. And you know, in my mind, that's IDR.\" You might expect it to be relatively simple to transfer a borrower's financial information and payment history from one loan servicer to another. But according to the documents obtained by NPR, moving borrower accounts is incredibly fraught. Borrowers' information is transferred via what's known as an EA27 file, and every time a file is transferred, data and context can be lost, and mistakes made. In fact, earlier versions of the EA27 didn't even include payment counts for certain IDR plans. Transferring these borrower files is like a game of telephone: The more you do it, the more likely the message gets muddled. As a result, when servicers inherit borrowers from other servicers, they often inherit records with holes. For example, the department's 2016 review of one servicer's records found glaring omissions in the accounts of transferred borrowers. Some records lacked basic information, like when a borrower changed repayment plans or how much the correct payment amount was. With holes like that, a borrower could ask their servicer how far they are from debt cancellation, but would get a wildly wrong answer. And all of these problems are compounded by the student loan system's original sin. Before the days of multiple loan servicers, there was simply one. From 1992 to 2009, ACS Education Services managed the entire federal student loan portfolio. But when the federal government ended its contract with ACS and the company began transferring borrowers' profiles to other servicers, it became clear that ACS had made a dizzying number of errors \u2014 more than 5 million according to a 2020 report. ACS has also faced allegations of mismanaging IDR, misleading borrowers and of taking months, even years in some cases, to correct and update borrowers' records. Nearly every borrower who could be eligible for cancellation under IDR in the next few years was serviced by ACS at some point. That means their current records, including the count of their progress toward cancellation, could be built on the sand of erroneous data. This matters now more than ever, after several servicers have ended their federal contracts and more than a quarter of all borrowers have been \u2014 or soon will be \u2014 transferred to new servicers. The good news is, some big, forward-looking changes have already been made or are in the works, including efforts to streamline cumbersome annual paperwork requirements. While these reforms will help moving forward, they won't do anything for the borrowers who have already been hurt by IDR's past problems. That's something the Education Department promised to address in its Friday statement to NPR, saying, \"We will be making operational changes to get things right moving forward, and we will fix this for the borrowers who have been harmed by past failures with payment counting.\" Recently, more than 100 different advocacy groups cosigned a letter to U.S. Education Secretary Miguel Cardona demanding an IDR waiver that would retroactively loosen the program's rules, like the one being offered for the similarly troubled Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program. Rep. Bobby Scott would go one step further. \"If you've made qualifying payments, you need to get credit for them,\" Scott says. \"And if the Department of Education has lost records, then the presumption or the burden of producing the records ought to be on the Department of Education.\" Not everyone believes the remedy should fall to the department. \"We're not going to get these programs cleaned up without legislation,\" says AEI's Beth Akers, who supports the idea of IDR and blames lawmakers for creating such a difficult suite of programs to implement. \"The servicers have a thankless job. So does the Department of Education, because they were handed a pile of garbage.\" Several advocacy groups, including The Education Trust and the Student Borrower Protection Center, have not only called for an IDR waiver but also substantial student loan cancellation for all borrowers, not just those hurt by IDR's failings. \"We just need to recognize that there are these systemic failures \u2014 that, across the board, people are struggling to make these payments,\" says Victoria Jackson, who studies higher education policy at The Education Trust. \"And we can do that in a simple, straightforward way by having broad-based debt cancellation.\" Though that level of relief doesn't sit well with Rep. Virginia Foxx. \"We don't do that for people who borrow money to buy a car. We don't do that for people who buy a home,\" she says. \"... So why should we treat loans for college differently than the way we treat loans for anything else?\" While there is disagreement about a remedy here, all agree: IDR has failed many borrowers. Back in 2010, President Barack Obama celebrated the promise of income-driven repayment, declaring that \"in the United States of America, no one should go broke because they chose to go to college.\" Twelve years later, the promise of IDR remains as powerful as it is unfulfilled.

BOGOTA, Colombia \u2014 In a blow to Colombia's political class, a leftist former rebel and a populist businessman took the top two spots in the country's presidential election Sunday and headed to a runoff showdown in June. Leftist Sen. Gustavo Petro led the field of six candidates with just over 40% of the votes, while independent real estate tycoon Rodolfo Hern\u00e1ndez finished second with more than 28%, election authorities said Sunday evening. A candidate needed 50% of the total votes to win outright the contest held amid a polarized environment and growing discontent over increasing inequality and inflation. No matter who wins June 19, the South American country long governed by conservatives or moderates will see a dramatic shift in presidential politics. Petro has promised to make significant adjustments to the economy, including tax reform, and to change how Colombia fights drug cartels and other armed groups. Hern\u00e1ndez, whose spot in the runoff contest came as a surprise, has few connections to political parties and promises to reduce wasteful government spending and to offer rewards for people who report corrupt officials. Looking at areas where Hern\u00e1ndez won in some of the most traditional heartland departments, \"the rejection of the status quo even among many of the most conservative Colombians ... really does show a disgust with the traditional workings of Colombian politics,\" said Adam Isacson, an expert on Colombia at the Washington Office on Latin America think tank. Petro's main rival for most of the campaign was Federico Gutierrez, a former mayor of Medellin who was seen as the continuity candidate and ran on a pro-business, economic growth platform. But Hern\u00e1ndez began to move up strongly in recent polls heading into the election. There has been a series of leftist political victories in Latin America as people seek change at a time of dissatisfaction with the economic situation. Chile, Peru and Honduras elected leftist presidents in 2021, and in Brazil, former President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva is leading the polls for this year's presidential election. Mexico elected a leftist president in 2018. \"The main problem in the country is the inequality of conditions, the work is not well paid,\" said Jenny Bello, who sold coffee near a long line of voters under a typical cloudy sky in the capital of Bogot\u00e1. She had to resort to informal sales after months without work because of the pandemic.

This was the second presidential election held since the government signed in 2016 a peace agreement with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, known as FARC for its initials in Spanish. But the divisive agreement was not a main issue during the campaign, which focused on poverty, inflation and other challenges exacerbated by the pandemic. It is Petro's third attempt to become president. He was defeated in 2018 by Iv\u00e1n Duque, who was not eligible to seekr re-election. \"What is in dispute today is change. The political parties allied to the government of Duque, his political project, has been defeated in Colombia,\" Petro told his supporters as they celebrated at his campaign headquarters in Bogot\u00e1. \"Colombia's total vote launches that message to the world: A period is ending; an era is ending.\" A victory for Petro would usher in a new political era in a country that has long marginalized the left due to its perceived association with the nation's armed conflict. He was once a rebel with the now-defunct M-19 movement and was granted amnesty after being jailed for his involvement with the group. \"The peace accords of 2016 really broke the link between left politics and guerrillas/terrorists,\" Isacson said. \"I think people suddenly realized they could be very critical of the existing system without being painted as a guerrilla.\" But in a sign of the resistance to a leftist government, Gutierrez endorsed Hern\u00e1ndez shortly after he was left out of the runoff. \"Knowing that our position is decisive for the future of Colombia, we have made a decision ... we do not want to lose the country,\" Gutierrez said, adding that he would support Hern\u00e1ndez because he does not want to put Colombia \"at risk.\" Petro has promised to make significant adjustments to the economy, including a tax reform, as well as changes to how Colombia fights drug cartels and other armed groups. Hern\u00e1ndez, the former mayor of the north-central city of Bucaramanga, surged in recent polls with promises to \"clean\" the country of corruption and to donate his salary. \"Now, we enter the second period, and these next few days will be decisive in determining the future of the country,\" Hern\u00e1ndez said in a livestream after early results showed he advanced to the runoff. He said he remains firm on his commitment to end \"corruption as a system of government.\" A Gallup poll conducted earlier this month said 75% of Colombians believe the country is heading in the wrong direction and only 27% approve of Duque. A poll last year by Gallup found 60% of those questioned were finding it hard to get by on their income. The pandemic set back the country's anti-poverty efforts by at least a decade. Official figures show that 39% of Colombia's 51.6 million residents lived on less than $89 a month last year, which has a slight improvement from 42.5% in 2020. Inflation reached its highest levels in two decades last month. Duque's administration said April's 9.2% rate was part of a global inflationary phenomenon, but the argument did nothing to tame discontent over increasing food prices.

In addition to economic challenges, Colombia's next president will also have to face a complex security issue and corruption, which is a top concern of voters. The Red Cross last year concluded Colombia reached its highest level of violence in the last five years. Although the peace agreement with the FARC has been implemented, the territories and drug-trafficking routes that it once controlled are in dispute between other armed groups such as the National Liberation Army, or ELN, a guerrilla founded in the 1960s, FARC dissidents and the Gulf Clan cartel. Duque's successor will have to decide whether to resume peace talks with the ELN, which he suspended in 2019 after an attack killed more than 20 people. \"Corruption in state entities is the main problem in the country,\" \u00c9dgar Gonz\u00e1lez said after voting in Bogot\u00e1. \"... A very big change is taking place in the country's politics and if we all exercise the right we are going to achieve that change.\"",

            "article_content": "Lebanon is holding parliamentary elections against the backdrop of a severe economic crisis. Here's a look at what's at stake for those in power and the candidates trying to replace them.  AILSA CHANG, HOST: Lebanon is a country in freefall. A United Nations report out this week slammed Lebanon's government for its, quote, \"callous destruction of the country's economy.\" The local currency has lost nearly all of its value in recent years. Food prices have spiraled out of control, and power cuts are frequent. It's against this backdrop that the country will hold parliamentary elections this weekend. And here to tell us more about that is NPR's Arezou Rezvani, who is in Beirut. Hi, Arezou. AREZOU REZVANI, BYLINE: Hi. CHANG: All right. So does it feel like the economic crisis there is the main issue driving voters this election cycle? REZVANI: It does feel that way. I think there are two big issues on voters' minds these days; first is the economy. People here are having a very hard time affording basic foods like milk and cooking oil and finding certain medicines. Getting money out of the bank is not just a simple errand here anymore. You have to sometimes wait hours in line to get a couple of hundred bucks out. The poverty rate in the country has jumped from 30% to an astonishing 80%. And what goes hand in hand with this economic crisis, people here will tell you, is corruption. For years, the government and the banking sector mismanaged and squandered cash reserves. And finally, a couple of years ago, the entire system collapsed. And so people here have been living with those consequences ever since. CHANG: Right. So this will be the first election since the onset of this economic crisis. Does it seem like there's a greater appetite now for newer parties, newer candidates? REZVANI: Yeah, there is. But the question is, can they break through the establishment? There are many more opposition parties and newer, fresher faces this cycle than in years past. I've been spending time with some of the opposition parties. Rania al-Masri is a member of a progressive party named Citizens in a State. It kind of has the look and feel of the Bernie Sanders campaign - very young, very diverse. Here's how she described her party's positions to me at a recent campaign event. RANIA AL-MASRI: We stand for full separation of church and state, and we stand in rejection of a bankers' Ponzi scheme. We stand in rejection of sectarian political system. We stand to recognize that we can't solve this problem piecemeal. REZVANI: So clearly not shy about calling out the banking sector. And you can hear her also proposing a pretty provocative idea of a more non-sectarian political system. And given how desperate the situation is here at the moment, it's kind of created an opening for parties to float bigger, bolder ideas, you know, bold when you consider the support and alliances groups like Hezbollah have established here over the years. CHANG: Yeah. Well, how hard is it for new candidates to get elected inside Lebanon's political system? REZVANI: So the voting process here is definitely not set up to welcome political newcomers, and there are a few reasons why. There's the fact that here in Lebanon, by law, you have to vote in your ancestral home. And with hyperinflation, it's very expensive for people to get around when they can't even afford a tank of gas. This came up in a conversation I was having with Nina Jamal, owner of a clothing store here in Beirut. NINA JAMAL: I cannot vote because I vote in the south of Lebanon. To go there, I need 1 million lira, about $50, to go there and come back. I cannot afford it. REZVANI: So some of the most financially strapped people may have to sit this election out. On top of that, it's also hard for some candidates to get airtime here because TV networks charge for appearances. But more than anything, I think it's Lebanon's power sharing model of government, which has helped put an end to Lebanon's civil war years ago, that's a little bit of an issue. It was designed to guarantee representation of Sunnis, Shias and Christians, but it froze the sectarian parties in place. And what's emerged is a system of political gerrymandering, and it's allowed sectarian parties to seize and hold onto power. All of this together has a way of limiting a new candidate's chances of getting elected. And it's left a lot of people here skeptical that this election will change much. CHANG: That is NPR's Arezou Rezvani talking to us from Beirut about Lebanon's upcoming parliamentary elections. Thank you so much, Arezou. REZVANI: Thanks. Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.

            "article_content": "An unabated economic crisis in Lebanon is crushing the middle class. A look at how people there are coping ahead of Sunday's parliamentary elections.  A MARTINEZ, HOST: Right now to Lebanon. The country holds a parliamentary election Sunday, but that's hardly the most pressing issue for people there. They're struggling to buy groceries or get money from banks as the country's two-year economic crisis continues. And as NPR's Arezou Rezvani reports, it's shattered the middle class. (SOUNDBITE OF HORNS HONKING) AREZOU REZVANI, BYLINE: In Lebanon these days, it's not unusual for people to wait up to 2 hours to use an ATM. It's in one of those lines where I found Abdul Rabia one recent morning. Seventy-four years old and retired, he's been having a hard time withdrawing money he spent a lifetime saving. ABDUL RABIA: (Through interpreter) The money that I got for my retirement is in the bank. It's my whole life savings. And what am I doing? I'm begging every month for my money. REZVANI: For a while now, the banks here have limited withdrawals, and it's left people like Rabia extremely frustrated and resentful. RABIA: (Through interpreter) You know, they give it to us drop by drop. It's our money. And they've taken it. In fact, they've stolen it. REZVANI: A little farther down the line, I find Nabila Bashir Baydoun. NABILA BASHIR BAYDOUN: (Speaking Arabic). REZVANI: \"Life is super expensive - super expensive,\" she says. For the 70 year old, it's even put her health at risk. BAYDOUN: (Speaking Arabic). REZVANI: \"I take seven medications, and one now costs six times what it used to be,\" she says. For the medication she now has trouble finding, her son's friend brings it from Turkey whenever he visits. Hello. ELIE: Hello. REZVANI: Across town, Elie is getting ready to close his pharmacy for the day. He asks to use only his first name since he's not authorized to speak by the association of pharmacies. He's noticed that a lot of people who've come in lately leave empty-handed. ELIE: First question - they ask about the price. In many cases, they leave without buying. REZVANI: He's worked at this pharmacy for 30 years. When I ask him if he's ever seen the economy in such bad shape, maybe during the 15 year civil war, he says... ELIE: Never. Never, never, never. This last two years, it's another kind of life in everything. REZVANI: All of this is the result of what analysts and even leaders of donor countries say is mismanagement and corruption in the government that has squandered the country's cash reserves. International lenders have hesitated to bail Lebanon out until it reforms. Sami Halabi is an economic analyst with Triangle, a consulting group based in Beirut. And he says the economic crisis has been devastating even for the middle class. SAMI HALABI: People have lost 90% of their savings. And over the past 2 1/2 years, we've seen this increase in the poverty rate from 30% to 80%. REZVANI: It's amid this economic meltdown that Lebanon will hold parliamentary elections this Sunday. But Halabi is skeptical that a change in leadership will be enough to turn the tide any time soon. HALABI: The crisis is so much deeper and harder than we ever expected it to be, that there is no election or policy move that will provide us with a quick fix. Confidence in the economy and the banking sector has been smashed. And to regain that is probably a generational project. (SOUNDBITE OF SEWING MACHINE) REZVANI: Until then, workers like Claudette Mehanao, a designer and seamstress, will continue sewing late into the night. With her husband sick, she's now the one supporting her family. CLAUDETTE MEHANAO: (Through interpreter) It's very stressful. I've gone down 20 kilos in weight. In a way, my life's just disappeared in front of me. This is when I should be resting. This is - you know, I was able to make money. I was able to buy a house. And now I have to work. REZVANI: She has plenty of money in the bank. But like so many others, she can't get it out. Arezou Rezvani, NPR News, Beirut. (SOUNDBITE OF TIM SCHAUFERT'S \"JOURNEY\") Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.

With 80% of the votes tabulated, Marcos Jr. had 25.9 million, far ahead of his closest challenger, current Vice President Leni Robredo, a champion of human rights, who had 12.3 million. The election winner will take office on June 30 for a single, six-year term as leader of a Southeast Asian nation hit hard by two years of COVID-19 outbreaks and lockdowns. Still more challenging problems include deeper poverty and unemployment and decades-long Muslim and communist insurgencies. The next president is also likely to hear demands to prosecute outgoing President Rodrigo Duterte for thousands of killings during his anti-drug crackdown \u2014 deaths already under investigation by the International Criminal Court.

Duterte's daughter, southern Davao city Mayor Sara Duterte, is Marcos Jr.'s vice presidential running mate in an alliance of the scions of two authoritarian leaders. Their partnership has combined the voting power of their northern and southern political strongholds, boosting their chances but compounding worries of human rights activists. Sara Duterte also had a formidable lead with 25.8 million votes for vice president in the unofficial count from the Commission on Elections server. The president and vice president are elected separately in the Philippines. \"History may repeat itself if they win,\" said Myles Sanchez, a 42-year-old human rights worker. \"There may be a repeat of martial law and the drug killings that happened under their parents.\" In a late-night video statement, Marcos Jr. did not claim victory but thanked his supporters for accompanying him on \"this sometimes very difficult journey\" and urged them to keep up their guard until the vote count is completed. \"Let us keep watch on the vote,\" he said. \"If we'll be fortunate, I'll expect that your help will not wane, your trust will not wane because we have a lot of things to do in the times ahead.\" Presidential candidate Ferdinand Marcos Jr., the son of the late dictator, votes at a polling center in Batac City, Ilocos Norte, northern Philippines on Monday.\n                \n                    \n                    AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Presidential candidate Ferdinand Marcos Jr., the son of the late dictator, votes at a polling center in Batac City, Ilocos Norte, northern Philippines on Monday. Marcos Jr., whose father was ousted in a 1986 army-backed \"People Power\" uprising, held a wide lead in pre-election surveys. But Robredo tapped into shock and outrage over the prospect of a Marcos recapturing the seat of power and harnessed a network of campaign volunteers to underpin her candidacy. Officials said the election was relatively peaceful despite pockets of violence in the country's volatile south. Thousands of police and military personnel were deployed to secure election precincts, especially in rural regions with a history of violent political rivalries. Filipinos stood in long lines to cast their ballots, with the start of voting delayed by a few hours in a few areas due to malfunctioning vote machines, power outages, bad weather and other problems. Eight others were in the presidential race, including former boxing star Manny Pacquiao, Manila Mayor Isko Moreno and former national police chief Sen. Panfilo Lacson. Sanchez said the violence and abuses that marked the martial-law era under Marcos, and Duterte's drug war more than three decades later, victimized loved ones from two generations of her family. Her grandmother was sexually abused and her grandfather tortured by counterinsurgency troops under Marcos in the early 1980s in their impoverished farming village in Southern Leyte province. Under Duterte's crackdown, Sanchez's brother, a sister and a sister-in-law were wrongfully linked to illegal drugs and separately killed, she told The Associated Press in an interview. She described the killings of her siblings as \"a nightmare that has caused unspeakable pain.\" She begged Filipinos not to vote for politicians who either openly defended the widespread killings or conveniently looked away.

Marcos Jr. and Sara Duterte avoided such volatile issues in the campaign and steadfastly stuck instead to a battle cry of national unity, even though their fathers' presidencies opened some of the Philippines' most turbulent divisions. \"I have learned in our campaign not to retaliate,\" Sara Duterte told followers Saturday night on the final day of campaigning, where she and Marcos Jr. thanked a huge crowd in a night of rap music, dance shows and fireworks near Manila Bay. At her own rally, Robredo thanked her supporters who jammed her star-studded sorties and waged a house-to-house battle to endorse her brand of clean and hands-on politics. She asked them to fight for patriotic ideals beyond the elections. \"We've learned that those who have awoken will never close their eyes again,\" Robredo told a crowd that filled the main avenue in the capital's Makati financial district. \"It's our right to have a future with dignity and it's our responsibility to fight for it.\" In Maguindanao province, a security hot spot in the south, three village guards were killed by gunmen outside an elections center in Buluan town, briefly disrupting voting. Nine would-be voters and their companions were wounded separately Sunday night when unidentified men fired five rifle grenades in the Datu Unsay town hall, police said. Aside from the presidency, more than 18,000 government posts are being contested, including half of the 24-member Senate, more than 300 seats in the House of Representatives, as well as provincial and local offices across the archipelago of more than 109 million Filipinos. More than 67 million people were registered to vote, including about 1.6 million Filipinos overseas. In the 2016 contest, Duterte emerged as the clear winner within a few hours after polls closed and his key challengers quickly conceded. The vice presidential race that year was won narrowly by Robredo over Marcos Jr., and the outcome was slower to become known.",

Brazilians head to polls on Oct. 2 to elect a president, vice president, governors and senators. RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) \u2014 Brazilians were voting on Sunday in a highly polarized election that could determine if the country returns a leftist to the helm of the world's fourth-largest democracy or keeps the far-right incumbent in office for another four years. The race pits incumbent President Jair Bolsonaro against his political nemesis, former President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva. There are nine other candidates, but their support pales to that for Bolsonaro and da Silva. Recent opinion polls have given da Silva a commanding lead \u2014 the last Datafolha survey published Saturday found a 50% to 36% advantage for da Silva among those who intended to vote. It interviewed 12,800 people, with a margin of error of two percentage points. Agatha de Carvalho, 24, arrived to her local voting station in Rio de Janeiro's working class Rocinha neighborhood shortly before it opened, hoping to cast her ballot before work, but found 100 others were already lined up. She said she would vote for da Silva, and called Bolsonaro \"awful.\" \"A lot of people died because of him during the pandemic. If he hadn't done some of the things he did, some of those deaths could have been avoided,\" she said. Bolsonaro's administration has been marked by incendiary speech, his testing of democratic institutions, his widely criticized handling of the COVID-19 pandemic and the worst deforestation in the Amazon rainforest in 15 years. But he has built a devoted base by defending traditional family values, rebuffing political correctness and presenting himself as protecting the nation from leftist policies that infringe on personal liberties and produce economic turmoil. Also in Rocinha, Manuel Pintoadinho, a 65-year-old metalworker, said he voted for Bolsonaro and didn't blame him for tough economic times. \"The pandemic ruined everything, inflation is really high,\" Pintoadinho said. \"It's not his fault.\" A slow economic recovery has yet to reach the poor, with 33 million Brazilians going hungry despite higher welfare payments. Like several of its Latin American neighbors coping with high inflation and a vast number of people excluded from formal employment, Brazil is considering a shift to the political left. Gustavo Petro in Colombia, Gabriel Boric in Chile and Pedro Castillo in Peru are among the left-leaning leaders in the region who have recently assumed power. Da Silva could win in the first round, without need for a run-off on Oct. 30, if he gets more than 50% of valid votes, which exclude spoiled and blank ballots. Brazil has more than 150 million eligible voters, and voting is mandatory, but abstention rates can reach as high as 20%. An outright win by da Silva would sharpen focus on Bolsonaro's reaction to the count. He has repeatedly questioned the reliability not just of opinion polls, but also of Brazil's electronic voting machines. Analysts fear he has laid the groundwork to reject results. At one point, Bolsonaro claimed to possess evidence of fraud, but never presented any, even after the electoral authority set a deadline to do so. He said as recently as Sept. 18 that if he doesn't win in the first round, something must be \"abnormal.\" The two frontrunners have key bases of support: evangelicals and white men for Bolsonaro, and women, minorities and the poor for da Silva. Da Silva, 76, was once a metalworker who rose from poverty to the presidency and is credited with building an extensive social welfare program during his 2003-2010 tenure that helped lift tens of millions into the middle class. But he is also remembered for his administration's involvement in vast corruption scandals that entangled politicians and business executives. Da Silva's own convictions for corruption and money laundering led to 19 months imprisonment, sidelining him from the 2018 presidential race that polls indicated he had been leading against Bolsonaro. The Supreme Court later annulled da Silva's convictions on the grounds that the judge was biased and colluded with prosecutors. Marialva Santos Pereira, 47, said she would vote for the former president for the first time since 2002. \"I didn't like the scandals in his first administration, never voted for the Workers' Party again. Now I will, because I think he was unjustly jailed and because Bolsonaro is such a bad president that it makes everyone else look better.\" Speaking after casting his ballot in S\u00e3o Bernardo do Campo, the manufacturing hub in Sao Paulo state where he was a union leader, da Silva recalled that four years ago he was imprisoned and unable to vote. \"I want to try to make the country return to normality, try to make this country again take care of its people,\" he told reporters. Bolsonaro grew up in a lower-middle-class family before joining the army. He turned to politics after being forced out of the military for openly pushing to raise servicemen's pay. During his seven terms as a fringe lawmaker in Congress' lower house, he regularly expressed nostalgia for the country's two-decade military dictatorship. His overtures to the armed forces have raised concern that his possible rejection of election results could be backed by top brass. Traditionally, the armed forces' involvement in elections has been limited to carrying voting machines to isolated communities and beefing up security in violent regions. But this year, Bolsonaro suggested the military should conduct a parallel count of the ballots. While that didn't materialize, the Defense Ministry said it will cross check results in over 380 polling stations across Brazil. Any citizen or entity is able to do the same, consulting a vote tally available at each station after ballot closure and online. After voting in Rio, wearing a T-shirt with the green and yellow of Brazil's flag, Bolsonaro told journalists that a clean election must be respected and that the first round would be decisive. Asked if he would respect results, he gave a thumbs up and walked away. Because the vote is conducted electronically, preliminary results are usually out within minutes, with the final result available a few hours later. This year, all polls will close at 5 p.m. Brasilia time (4 p.m. EDT; 2000 GMT).",

GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip \u2014 When fighting erupted between Israel and the hard-line Palestinian militant group, Islamic Jihad, here earlier this month, the battle lasted just three days but it took a heavy toll: Gaza's Health Ministry said 49 Palestinians were killed, including 17 children. The Israeli military said it was targeting Islamic Jihad members for allegedly planning or executing attacks on Israelis. Israel says it killed 20 militants and acknowledges killing several civilians. Islamic Jihad responded to the attacks by firing more than 1,100 rockets, according to Israel, which said some of the rockets killed Gazan civilians when the projectiles fell short and landed in Gaza. People in Gaza say they believe the violence, and duration, would have been even worse had the larger, ruling militant group, Hamas, gotten involved. But in a change of tack, Hamas sat this one out.

Since the fighting \u2014 the deadliest in Gaza since last year's 11-day war \u2014 residents are having difficult discussions about the roles of the militant groups. Most Gazans support resistance against Israel for its treatment of Palestinians, and the militants do have active supporters. But many residents are frustrated at the groups over problems like unemployment and deep poverty. And some analysts see a rift forming between Hamas and Islamic Jihad, even though they project unity. \"Where is the role of the people when these factions go to war?\" asks Ahmed, a 37-year-old who wants to only use his first name to speak freely without fear of reprisals from militants. \"The people should have a say ... because we end up paying the price.\" Ahmed is sipping tea with friends in a park in Gaza City. The park and surrounding streets have gone totally dark \u2014 because the severe power shortage often leads to blackouts here. Ahmed says he's in favor of Palestinian resistance, but he blames Islamic Jihad for escalating the latest conflict in order to make a deal with Israel and free some of its prisoners.

Hamas took over Gaza from the Palestinian Authority about 15 years ago, leading Israel to impose heavy restrictions on goods and people transiting Gaza's borders. Hamas has fought multiple wars against Israel. Both Hamas and Islamic Jihad are listed as terrorist organizations by the United States, the European Union, Israel and other governments. The groups share some common ideology; analysts say they both want to create an Islamic Palestinian state \u2014 something many in Gaza support. Neither group recognizes Israel's existence. Their official line has been to present a unified front. Yet some Gazans accuse Hamas of abandoning Islamic Jihad, even as Israel targeted the group's leaders this month. Israel called the operation a success that severely set back Islamic Jihad.

On Monday, Hamas and Islamic Jihad leaders met to discuss bilateral relations and released a joint statement affirming their unity, saying that \"the resistance is the strategic choice in confronting the occupation.\" However, the rivalry between the two has never been more obvious, according to Tholfekar Swairjo,a political analyst who previously was a spokesman for a secular leftist Palestinian movement and now offers commentary in local media. \"First of all, Hamas wants to protect its authority in the Gaza Strip,\" he says. \"There is boiling anger in the streets against the Hamas movement. They are blamed for the very low quality of life in Gaza, and so now they don't want to engage in any war that would increase the level of anger against them from the Palestinians.\" Swairjo says Hamas couldn't jeopardize recent understandings with Israel that would bring economic relief to Gaza. Thousands of Palestinians from Gaza are now allowed to work in Israel, and there has also been an increase in goods and supplies going into Gaza. Islamic Jihad \u2014 considered more hard-line \u2014 views that as selling out. \"Islamic Jihad say economic incentives that Israel has offered to Gaza has become a knife to the neck of the armed resistance,\" Swairjo says. The two militant groups are also in competition for supporters. And according to Swairjo, Hamas has lost some of its recruiting momentum to Islamic Jihad. Unlike Hamas, which participates in elections and now governs, Swairjo says, Islamic Jihad has no political ideology or even goals beyond fighting Israel. And that can attract a lot of different groups, from Islamists to secular and leftist followers. For many Gazans, however, there's no difference between Hamas and Islamic Jihad.

Because they don't feed us, they don't provide anything. You have to depend on yourself. How can we build a future with these guys? And all the back to back wars?\" The presence of the militant groups is also threatening and divisive, she adds. The fighters are often targeted by the Israelis, and civilians who live near them can become casualties. \"People have started to be afraid of where they are living, who their neighbors are, what their political leanings might be,\" Reham says. \"It's affecting community relationships.\" She and many others think it's foolish to expect stability in Gaza. \"There is no guarantee for anything in Gaza,\" she says. \"We don't know when or why or how the war happens.\" All that's known is, when war happens, she says, no one is safe, regardless of politics.

            "article_content": "Long before the reign of Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos, there was Jack Welch. Welch, who headed up the General Electric Company from 1981 and 2001, is often thought of as the first celebrity CEO, a businessman who wowed investors and mingled with celebrities. \"[Welch's] face was on the cover of magazines all the time,\" New York Times correspondent David Gelles says. \"He emerged as sort of this imperial executive and helped define what I think is still with us today in the form of a certain amount of CEO worship.\" In his book, The Man Who Broke Capitalism, Gelles makes the case that Welch's ruthless cost-cutting and single-minded focus on quarterly earnings ultimately hurt both GE and American capitalism. \"Neutron Jack,\" as he became known, had a practice of ranking employees and automatically firing the bottom 10 percent every year; in Welch's first few years of leadership he fired more than 100,000 people in a series of mass layoffs and factory closures. \"Up until this point, people who had a job at a company like GE or IBM basically figured that they had a job for life. But he explicitly said that this notion was going to be a thing of the past under his watch,\" Gelles says. Many of the jobs that Welch cut were sent overseas: \"We see the first great wave of labor, American manufacturing labor, going abroad, and thus begins the real beginning of serious outsourcing that would, of course, decimate America's manufacturing base,\" Gelles says. Welch made aggressive deals, including the acquisition of NBC in 1986, with an eye toward expanding GE's influence. The moves initially buoyed the company's stock price; in Sept. 1993, GE became the most valuable company on the stock market. But ultimately, Welch's leadership did not lead to long-term profits. He championed risky financial ventures and acquisitions, which his successor then continued. GE's focus on subprime mortgages and short-term lending would prove costly when the 2008 financial crisis hit.  In 2021, GE's current chief executive announced that the company would separate itself into three smaller standalone companies: One focused on jet engines, one focused on medical devices, and one focused on power equipment. \"This is all that's left of Jack Welch's legacy,\" Gelles says. \"Far from being the most valuable company on Earth and a conglomerate that spanned the world and all these different industries, GE is now going to be essentially chopped up into three different discrete pieces \u2013 and that's the end of the story.\" On GE's role in the American economy before Welch took over As I dug into the history of GE, I found it hard to overstate not only the impact that GE still had in 1981 when Jack took over, but really its role in the history of American industry for the better part of the century before that. This was the company that brought us electric light bulbs, power plants, X-ray machines. This was the company that introduced everyday products like the toaster oven. They were behind the mass marketing of radio sets and televisions, dishwashers. The list just went on and on. ... When you looked at their influence on industry and government beyond what we might find in our kitchens, they were no less influential there as well. It was GE that helped put men on the moon on the Apollo missions. You go back and look at those pictures and there are lines and lines of GE engineers working side-by-side with NASA engineers. And right up to the present day, the size of that company became, at one point, I think, representing something close to 1% of the American GDP. And there was a phrase, \"As GE goes, so goes the American economy.\" ... David Gelles is a correspondent on the climate desk at The New York Times.\n\n                    \n                    Simon & Schuster\n                    \n                \nhide caption David Gelles is a correspondent on the climate desk at The New York Times. Big companies back then \u2014 and GE is a perfect example of this \u2014 were proud of the way that they distributed their profits widely with employees, with their supply chains, and even with the government. It was a 1953 annual report by GE that I cite in the book, where they brag about how much they're paying in salaries to their workers and how much they're paying in taxes to the government. I don't need to tell you that that's a whole lot different than the way many companies operate today. On Welch's background He was impulsive, somewhat aggressive, restless, ambitious, impatient. He was raised primarily by his mother, who was a devout Catholic. One amazing anecdote I found was that she taught him to gamble at an early age, making him wager his own money to learn, in a visceral sense, what it meant to win and lose. But he was also deeply involved in the faith. He was an altar boy. There were flashes of a temper from an early age. There's an anecdote ... where he talks about caddying at a local golf course. And the man he was caddying for asked him to go fetch a ball that had gone in the water. And instead, he throws the man's golf clubs in the water and storms off the course. So you see flashes of a temper. And that continues right on into his early days at GE, when, as a young associate, his first year at the company, he decides to quit because he learns that his colleagues got the same raise that he did and he thought he was doing better. So he said he would quit the company, and it was only after his superior promised to give him an even bigger raise that he agreed to stay. On Welch's practice of ranking employees and firing the bottom 10% He had a euphemistic name for this practice. He called it the \"vitality curve,\" but it was known internally and more broadly in the public as stack ranking or even more sharply \"rank and yank.\" And the idea is this: Managers, he said, needed to rank their employees. 20% get A grade, 70% get a B grade, and 10% get a C grade. And if you're in that 10%, you're out of the company. He did that for 20 years inside GE, which led to thousands and thousands of layoffs. And it became, because he was so influential, dogma in corporate America. When Steve Ballmer took over Microsoft, he implemented stack ranking and it led to great turmoil in the ranks of Microsoft. And even more recently, Adam Neumann, the founder of WeWork, was using stack ranking as WeWork was growing so quickly, even though that company had billions and billions of dollars in funding, he saw the need to fire 10% of its workers every single year because Jack did it. On Welch's unflattering nickname \"Neutron Jack\" He hated the \"Neutron Jack\" name, even though he could never shake it. Even when he died in 2020, President Trump gave him a tweet. He said \"There was no corporate leader like Neutron Jack,\" so that label stuck with him for the duration of his life. What was so remarkable, though, is that despite the negative press he got in those early years, he was able to continue his work because the GE board, and ultimately Wall Street and ultimately the rest of corporate America, saw that what he was doing was, for better or worse, working in the short-term. These strategies he was employing were indeed ticking up short-term profits. All of a sudden, other CEOs saw that, Hey, yes, if we rapidly wind down the cost of our labor, we could potentially see a meaningful increase in earnings per share for the next quarter and Wall Street sure liked that. And so there was this incentive system that encouraged other CEOs to start following his lead. And what's so remarkable is that even after these first years of pretty withering press, he's able to survive and ultimately become revered as the absolute model CEO, to the point that Fortune magazine at the end of his career, calls him \"the manager of the century.\" On Welch's impact on GE employees During his time at GE, many GE workers benefited those men and women at the company who were invested in GE stock, they got to see their fortunes rise along with Welch's and the company's. But again, it depends on the time horizon we're looking at. If we're looking at just the years he was running the company and just what he did and who benefited at that point, you can make a case that, sure, he was good for at least the GE workers who didn't get fired under rank and yank or under his downsizing or offshoring or outsourcing. But fast forward and look at what happens to these pensioners. Look what happens to the men and women holding GE stock as it plummets in the years following his departure. Because when he leaves, all of these flaws are fundamentally exposed and Wall Street starts seeing through the charade. So his reputation among workers was a complex one. I think for some GE workers, they enjoyed the benefits. But even in the '90s, when Jack was riding high, it was becoming commonly understood among organized labor, among union leaders, that Jack had led a charge in the early '80s that was resonating with them still and has ultimately helped erode union membership in this country to record low levels today. On General Electric today From being the most valuable company on Earth, GE fell to the point of essential irrelevance in the American economy. In 2018, with all of Welch's bad decisions catching up with the company, GE was removed from the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the bluest of blue chip indexes and a real bellwether of the American economy. GE had been one of the very first companies included in the index, and it was ultimately the last of that original group to be removed, but its departure from the Dow was this real symbolic moment that ultimately set the stage for news that happened just last year, which was the fact that GE is finally getting broken up once and for all.

            "article_content": "The party's over. Over the last few weeks, asset prices have tumbled, and investors in stocks, bonds, cryptocurrencies \u2014 pretty much everything \u2014 have been forced to wake up and face the brutal hangover of collapsing fortunes. Who broke up the rager? Largely, it seems, a little institution called the U.S. Federal Reserve, which has begun to raise interest rates and tighten monetary policy in order to wrangle inflation. What a buzzkill. What is this mysterious institution? How has it evolved to play this important role in our society? Why does it, as one former Fed official put it, seek to have \"the punch bowl removed\" at moments like this? And what happens when it doesn't? Well, the former Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke has some answers. Amid the downturn, Bernanke has swooped in and published a new book: 21st Century Monetary Policy: The Federal Reserve from the Great Inflation to COVID-19. They say it's impossible to time the market, but the man seems to have some killer timing. The book offers some important historical insights for the present economic moment. Bernanke begins his book with a cautionary tale from American history known as \"The Great Inflation.\" For most of the country's history, Bernanke writes, inflation had rarely been a big problem. Sure, the nation had bouts of high inflation. But it was usually around wartime, and the episodes were short-lived. America had never seen a decade-long stretch of high inflation. That changed during the Great Inflation. Stretching from the mid-1960s to the early-1980s, it's a period known for itty bitty shorts and tube socks, roller disco parties, cocaine, long lines at gas stations \u2014 and, oh yeah \u2014 climbing prices. Between 1965 and 1981, annual inflation averaged more than 7 percent. In 1979 and 1980, average inflation peaked at almost 13 percent a year. In Bernanke's telling, the story of the Great Inflation begins with deficit spending. John F. Kennedy had run for president during a recession and promised to \"get America moving again.\" As president, Kennedy proposed a big tax cut to boost the economy and lower unemployment, which stood at almost 7 percent when he entered office. After Kennedy was assassinated, Lyndon B. Johnson, his successor, followed through with the tax cut, which helped bring unemployment down to 4 percent by the end of 1965. That was the level of unemployment that macroeconomists at the time believed was full employment, or the theoretical threshold when the labor market starts to get so tight that wages and prices start to explode. \"From a macroeconomic policy perspective, it would have been a logical moment to ease up on the accelerator, but foreign policy and social goals took priority over economic stability,\" Bernanke writes. When President Johnson plunged America even more deeply into the war in Vietnam in 1965, he opened up a firehouse of federal spending. Defense spending rose about 44 percent between 1965 and 1968. America would spend almost $850 billion on the war (in today's dollars). Because the war was already unpopular, Bernanke writes, Johnson was reluctant to support tax increases to pay for it, meaning this was a bunch of new money juicing the economy. At the same time, Johnson launched his War on Poverty and the Great Society programs. This included creating the government healthcare programs Medicare (for elderly Americans) and Medicaid (for low-income Americans), which both began in 1965. \"Many Great Society programs would ultimately have important benefits,\" Bernanke writes, \"but they also had the effect of adding further to government spending.\" All this deficit spending heated up an economy that was already running hot. Military contractors used government money to build guns, bombs, planes, and helicopters. Medical providers used government money on procedures, check-ups, hospital expansions, and so on. This increased demand for labor and materials already in short supply, pushing up the price of everything. By the time President Nixon came into office in 1969, inflation was surging. Nixon continued the inflationfest with policies like an intensification of the Vietnam War, deficit spending, and, as we shall see, sticking his nose where his nose didn't belong: monetary policy. Early in his presidency, Richard Nixon appointed a close ally to head the Federal Reserve: Arthur Burns. Often pictured smoking a pipe, Burns was an economist at Columbia University who served as the economic adviser to Nixon's 1968 presidential campaign. \"Once Burns was installed at the Fed, Nixon had no reservations about using their relationship to his political advantage,\" Bernanke writes. \"With unemployment having risen during the 1970 recession, the president wanted a strong economy going into the 1972 election.\" Leaked recordings from the Nixon White House \u2014 the so-called Nixon tapes \u2014 provide smoking-gun evidence that Nixon directly pressured Burns to stimulate the economy with looser monetary policy (even though a temporary boost in economic growth did not serve the long-term interest of the economy or the public). We don't know exactly why Burns ended up agreeing to Nixon's demands. Bernanke entertains the possibility that Burns was acting with some personal conviction. Burns apparently believed that the Congress and the President should tackle inflation with more surgical price controls rather than the Fed whacking it with the brute force of higher interest rates. The Nixon administration did, in fact, impose price controls at various times, including on gas. In 1973, when the supply shock of skyrocketing oil prices hit the economy, inflation got worse and so did economic growth. Inflation became stagflation, or inflation combined with stagnating growth, something many economists at the time did not even believe was possible. Nixon's response was to try and cap the price of oil. Bernanke and most other economists blame this policy for creating shortages and infamous lines at gas stations \u2014 while also failing to get inflation under control. Whatever the reasons, Burns failed to use the powers of the Fed to end high inflation. Even after it was clear that price controls failed \u2014 and even after Nixon resigned \u2014 Burns continued to shy away from raising interest rates to the level needed to end inflation, fearing it would cause a deep recession. Instead, he let inflation fester throughout the 1970s, which, Bernanke writes, convinced the public that inflation was here to stay. Companies and workers conducted their business and contract negotiations accordingly. These \"inflation expectations,\" as economists refer to the psychological component of inflation, made price increases even worse. It would take President Jimmy Carter appointing a new Fed chairman, Paul Volcker, in 1979 for the Fed to change tack. \"The Fed had lost its credibility as an inflation-fighter, and the challenge for the new chair was to restore it,\" Bernanke writes. Fiercely independent and often working directly counter to the short-term electoral interests of the president, Volcker waged an epic war against inflation. He ended up raising the Fed's main policy interest rate, the federal funds rate, to almost 20 percent \u2014 the highest it's ever been. In doing so, he plunged the nation into a deep, albeit temporary recession. But, Bernanke writes, he also set the stage for decades of stable prices and economic growth. America is now being forced to reckon with high inflation for the first time since the days of the Great Inflation. Bernanke believes this historical experience offers important lessons for the Fed. First, the Fed needs to take the lead on inflation. Burns had believed that Congress and the President could use policies like price controls to get the job done, which only made the economic situation worse. Second, the Fed should take inflation expectations seriously. It needs to credibly work to keep inflation in check from the start. Kicking the can down the road only allows the psychology of inflation to fester in the minds of the public, forcing future Fed chairs to take even more draconian measures to get it under control (as Paul Volcker was forced to do). Finally, political interference in Fed policy-making can be dangerous. Presidents, like Richard Nixon, have a personal interest in juicing the economy before elections. This interest can run counter to the long-run interest of the economy and the public. And, here, Bernanke has some worries. In his book, he frets about former President Donald Trump's frequent Twitter tirades against Fed Chair Jerome Powell, a man Trump himself had appointed to be Fed chair. More broadly, Bernanke expresses concerns about current political trends. \"The rise of populism, with its conspiracy theories and distrust of elites, poses a particular threat to technocratic, nonpartisan institutions like the Fed,\" he writes. That said, the Fed *is* currently working to end inflation, and, so far, it seems like most people are cool with it. In many ways, the effects \u2014 like nosediving asset prices \u2014 create a headache. But, if history is any guide, the hangover caused by the alternative sucks even more.",

History could come full circle in the Philippines next month. Decades after dictator Ferdinand Marcos was ousted in a popular uprising that laid bare the brutality and sweeping corruption of his regime, his son is poised to revive the family's political fortunes in next month's presidential elections. In the race to replace outgoing President Rodrigo Duterte, the latest polling shows that the 64-year-old Ferdinand \"Bongbong\" Marcos Jr. is maintaining a significant, if slightly receding, lead. While Duterte, 77, cannot by law seek reelection, his daughter is running for vice president alongside Marcos. But the prospect of a Marcos restoration inflames passions. Supporters see vindication, and opponents see an assault on the country's fragile democracy. The elder Marcos was \"capable, brilliant, cunning, utterly rapacious,\" says historian Joseph Scalice. However, \"what lingers in popular memory is corruption and theft,\" he says. \"But in the end, the Marcos administration \u2014 its military rule \u2014 was brutal.\" Marcos assumed office in 1965, imposed martial law in 1972 and didn't formally lift it until nearly a decade later, in 1981. Scalice says the Marcos era saw the warrantless arrests of 70,000 people, the deaths of nearly 4,000, the stifling of free speech and the persecution of political rivals. After nearly 21 years in power, Marcos' rule collapsed with stunning speed in 1986, as popular discontent boiled over. Army generals revolted and millions of Filipinos marched in the streets. The embattled president's longtime ally, the U.S., called on him to step down. Pressured from all sides, Marcos surrendered the presidency and fled to Hawaii with his wife Imelda and their family. Corazon \"Cory\" Aquino, the widow of assassinated Philippine opposition leader Benigno Aquino and leader of the peaceful People Power Revolution, became president. Ferdinand Marcos, with his wife Imelda at his side and Ferdinand Marcos Jr., far right, gestures from the balcony of Malacanang Palace on Feb. 25, 1986, in Manila, after taking the oath of office as president of the Philippines.

The family fled to the U.S. shortly thereafter. Former first lady Imelda Marcos, famous for her lavish shoe collection, recalled stuffing \"diamonds into diapers\" in the rush to escape aboard a U.S. Air Force plane. During what was described as their conjugal dictatorship, the first couple is alleged to have stolen between $5 billion and $10 billion. The Philippine government has recovered some $3.4 billion from the couple's ill-gotten wealth, and is still collecting.

Marcos, tainted as a kleptocrat, died in Hawaii in 1989. But his widow returned to the Philippines in 1991, an undiminished force in the family's political machinery. She was elected to the Philippines House of Representatives four times, and unsuccessfully sought the presidency in 1992, yearning all the while for her family's return to power. \"I miss the clout of being first lady ... I miss the clout wherein you can do so much,\" she said in an interview for the 2019 documentary The Kingmaker, confessing that she always wanted her only son to follow his father's footsteps and become president. Now, at 92, she may get her wish. Since returning from exile, the younger Marcos has occupied elected office as governor in the family stronghold of Ilocos Norte province. He's served as a member of congress and senator, compiling what critics say is a legislative record of no particular distinction. In 2016, he lost a close contest for vice president. He is campaigning for president as a \"unifying\" candidate, even as critics argue his family has neither apologized for \u2014 nor properly accounted for \u2014 its past behavior. In a bid to rewrite the past, Marcos narrates polished videos that portray his parents as philanthropists and his father as a great innovator, sidestepping any mention of human rights abuses or theft of the national treasury. Imelda Marcos endorses her son Ferdinand \"Bongbong\" Marcos Jr., second from right, as a vice presidential candidate in 2015.\n                \n                    \n                    Bullit Marquez/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Imelda Marcos endorses her son Ferdinand \"Bongbong\" Marcos Jr., second from right, as a vice presidential candidate in 2015. Scalice says that revisionist effort, aided by falsehoods and misinformation, can flourish because textbooks in Philippine high schools have never taught the crimes of the martial law era. \"It's always been sort of passed over as the personal excesses of the Marcos couple, Ferdinand and Imelda, and Imelda is remembered not for her brutality, but for her shoes,\" he says. Such myth-making glorifies a period of tyranny and corruption in which Marcos the son was as invested as his parents, Scalice says. The danger is not that Marcos Jr. will bring back martial law, he says \u2014 rather that \"a brutal dictatorship is being rehabilitated and brought back into Philippine life.\" A supporter holds pictures of the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos and his wife Imelda Marcos, as Ferdinand \"Bongbong\" Marcos Jr. and Davao city Mayor Sara Duterte, daughter of President Rodrigo Duterte, take part in a rally to campaign for the presidency and the vice presidency in February, in Manila.\n                \n                    \n                    Ezra Acayan/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption A supporter holds pictures of the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos and his wife Imelda Marcos, as Ferdinand \"Bongbong\" Marcos Jr. and Davao city Mayor Sara Duterte, daughter of President Rodrigo Duterte, take part in a rally to campaign for the presidency and the vice presidency in February, in Manila. The Marcoses appear to be benefiting from \"an extensive network\" of anonymously managed social media accounts and online influencers, says Gemma Mendoza, who oversees coverage of disinformation for the Philippine news platform Rappler. Maria Ressa, Rappler's CEO won last year's Nobel Peace Prize. The network of influencers is seeking to advance the \"family's makeover\" and \"to alter public perception,\" Mendoza says. Their conspiracy-laced content, followed by millions, vilifies Marcos rivals and the mainstream media, she says, trolling and intimidating journalists assigned to cover the campaign. \"That's very worrisome for democracy, for press freedom, because the press is bearing the brunt of this,\" Mendoza says. None of the dozen online influencers NPR reached out to agreed to be interviewed. Historian Manuel Quezon says the Philippines is part of a global trend whereby extreme views find favor with voters, while fueling anti-democratic impulses. He says the Marcoses do not publicly support such narratives, but he says the phenomenon has been a boon to the family's political fortunes. \"Think Q-Anon, but Philippine style,\" he says. Meanwhile, the Philippines Bureau of Internal Revenue recently confirmed it had presented Marcos Jr. with a tax notice last December in connection with his father's estate. Former Supreme Court Justice Antonio Carpio, who supports current Vice President Leni Robredo's candidacy for president, says the newest demand letter is only the latest of several sent over the past two decades that Marcos has shown a \"willful refusal\" to pay. Twenty-five years ago, the Supreme Court ruled that 23 billion pesos ($442 million) was due. Carpio says with interest and penalties, the tax obligation has likely ballooned and the Marcos heirs should be criminally charged for lack of payment.

In a statement last week, Marcos spokesman Victor Rodriguez blasted Carpio for \"lies, hatred, and black propaganda,\" saying that properties of the estate had been forfeited \"in favor of the government in satisfaction of the estate tax due.\" Former BIR Chairman Kim Henares, who served from 2010 to 2016, tells NPR that during her tenure, she chose not to pursue criminal charges because she determined that the Marcos family would deploy a battery of lawyers, and the case would absorb all the resources of her office. The Marcos campaign did not respond to NPR's request for comment on this or any other issue. Manila-based political analyst Richard Heydarian says Marcos has effectively tapped into discontent over the governments that followed his father's rule. Successive administrations did not, as promised, narrow the gap between the rich and poor or stamp out corruption, he says. While average income has risen over the years, the Philippine Statistics Authority says nearly 24% of Filipinos, or 26 million people, lived below the poverty threshold in 2021, a result exacerbated by the pandemic. Five years ago, 86% of Filipinos were found to have less than $10,000 in wealth. Heydarian says many Filipinos are disillusioned and nostalgic, and a considerable number over age 50 are \"trying to convince their children and their grandchildren that \u2013 'Hey, if we go back to the Marcos era, those were the golden days, those were the days of strength, and innocence and statesmanship.'\" Marcos has promised to improve health care, expand educational opportunities and combat climate change. But tucking into dinner at a Manila fish market, Jeffrey Zorilla, 39, a freelance actor, says it's the warm memories his parents have of the senior Marcos that appeal to him. \"Bring back the life we had before,\" he says, when the \"peso was strong.\" He says, \"Marcos did that.\" As for martial law, his parents told him it instilled \"discipline.\" While his father's loyalties to the United States were unquestioned, Marcos Jr. lives in a world where the U.S.-China rivalry presents geopolitical stakes of a different order, and they loom over the Philippines. Beijing's expansive claim to most of the South China Sea unnerves its smaller neighbors \u2014 including the Philippines. By wide margins, Filipinos say they distrust China and want Philippine interests defended. But Marcos says he is inclined to walk away from a landmark Hague tribunal ruling favoring the Philippines over China and its claim to much of the South China Sea. This position sets him apart from his four main rivals, who are far more hard-line on China. Scalice says the Philippine business community backing Marcos wants him leaning toward Beijing. \"They are concerned that if they are too close to the military maneuvers of Washington or diplomatic statements of Washington, that they will alienate China and they will lose their economic opportunities,\" he says. Scalice calls it an \"untenable balancing act.\" Whether Marcos will be the one who must weigh it up will depend on his rivals and whether they can mobilize against the brand he's offering. Analyst Robert Herrara-Lim says the chances of that happening in the May 9 election are \"small but not insignificant.\" If disgruntled voters begin to think Marcos \"has not held himself accountable,\" he says, they might start saying, \"You know what? Maybe he isn't the guy for [this] office.\" Ella Mage contributed to this story from Manila.",

Ladee Hubbard's brand-new collection of short stories, The Last Suspicious Holdout, takes place in an unnamed southern majority-Black suburb in the nineties and early 2000s. It's designed like a kind of diary for the community, with interconnecting events, people and places. As the years tick by, the adults fight for justice and financial security while grieving lost loved ones; the children grow up and become aware of the struggles they will inherit. Ladee Hubbard spoke with NPR's Juana Summers. Below are highlights from their conversation. The interview has been edited for brevity and clarity. Originally, this collection was going to be about the 20 years prior to Obama's election. And it's somewhat self-referential in that I was talking about myself and my generation, the generation of Black people that grew up in what was sometimes called \"the post-civil rights era.\" So we were coming to maturity during a period of time where people were sort of living within and with the victories of the civil rights movement. And that meant that for those Black people who could afford it, there were increasing opportunities to move to different neighborhoods, go to different schools and get different jobs. And I was very interested in the real effects of that movement and the repercussions of the civil rights movement during that period. These stories were actually written over a long period of time. I started writing them shortly after Obama's election, which of course, had a huge symbolic meaning of various sorts to a lot of people. But the main thing was that they were always situated in the same community. So it was always the same group of people. And I always wanted it to be each story would represent a different year. So that was really all I had to go on when I started writing them. And I am very interested in people that keep going, that survive hardships and find a way to keep believing and working towards things getting better. And so I think I wanted to represent and show that in the book. So you do see characters over time also. And part of their transformation is emblematic of some of the transformations that the community as a whole is going through. It's pretty interesting how much the cultural landscape has changed since I started writing these stories or in the issues that come up and then how much has changed in terms of how people talk about them right now. But for me, an underlying theme for them is probably, during this period, the difficulty of expressing grief. And I think that we're still dealing with the aftermath. There's a lot of things took a very long time apparently to be able to talk about them openly and honestly. And I think that it is important to know the history that came before. I think that where we are right now is very much emblematic of that. And so this is kind of a period where I don't think people were talking very honestly about a lot of issues and there was a lot of obfuscation in terms of how the certain things that were going on were represented. So yeah, so it's for me, it's almost like the quiet before a community reclaims its voice. I definitely think that is a recurrent theme of that era, and it certainly is in these stories. So part of what I was saying before is I feel like in terms of the opportunities that were presented to, again, people who could afford to take advantage of them, it was very much exacerbated in media representations. There was like this idea that Black identity had become bifurcated along class lines. And so the experiences of maybe upwardly mobile, middle-class Blacks were totally divorced from the Black majority. And of course, that's an idea that presupposes that structural racism no longer exists, which is not true. It was not true then and is, of course, not true now. It's kind of interesting that it seems more apparent now than it did 30 years ago. But I think that was a huge tension that a lot of people were grappling with. You can't have a post-racialism, that's what you would hear sometimes hear. That idea presupposes that there is no more structural racism no longer exists. I think the idea that you would have these very complicated feelings about your family is pretty common. It's not a monolith. It's not any more monolithic than any other community. But it's what creates you, it's part of who you are is how you sort of respond and process and deal with all of these sort of differences and different needs that people have and different ideas about what is the correct way to live. And you even if you chafe against that, it's still part of who you are. So it's not just a conversation because there are a lot of conflicts in that. But it becomes part of who you are. I think that a lot of the idea of manhood is very dependent on how women behave in response to men. So that story is really just about two women sort of dealing with maybe the ideas that they had about what they wanted from their relationships with men did not serve them and were not really ultimately empowering to the point where they sort of become unsustainable. So one of the characters says that she realized her husband had become a man she couldn't trust to do a simple task which is also a reference to fairy tales and just folklore and stuff like that. Because the idea of a man being given a task to do to achieve some kind of goal and in a lot of those stories, the way the women are represented, their function is to sort of help the man to realize his own identity. And I think a lot of women probably are brought up to think that that is somehow empowering, that they should be, as opposed to focusing a little bit more specifically on realizing their own identities. Probably to a certain extent. I mean, I think there are a lot of really painful things that Black people have been through. There's a lot of really painful things about the Black experience in this country. There's also a lot of really beautiful things that I hope I express as well. But again, I think that pointing out how hard it is for me, ultimately, it's a celebration of the resiliency and artistry of people because they can they keep going and keep trying and keep trying to envision new futures. And I think that's really beautiful and poignant. And it's more poignant when you realize how hard it is for a lot of people to do that. But I think that's one of the lessons I take from my own history, is we wouldn't be here if we weren't capable of enormous acts of imaginative bravery and hope. That's what hope is. It's a lot of bravery and artistry implicit in that. I hope that the people in these stories come across - like the fact that I do consider a lot of them very beautiful human beings comes across. It's not just suffering. And it is about connections with each other as well. There are things that are sustaining, despite all of that. It's very complicated for me. To a certain extent, though, it is how I work through my emotional and intellectual issues or things that are moving and profound to me. But I think the beauty of the artistry and the amount that people have managed to create and contribute to the United States in the world as a whole is incredibly moving to me. So I think about those things a lot and I hope that comes across as well. Well, one is, again about the complexity of the things that people certainly people that I knew were dealing with during that period of time. And also again, it's an evocation to resiliency and strength. So I just wanted to represent that because I felt it was very important to me. And as a writer a lot of the things that were very interesting to me ultimately did have to do with language, with the ability to access language to express what was going on and how people felt during that period. I think it was pretty hard. So resiliency and that I find something very poetic and beautiful about that.  I think it's a very important period of history as well in terms of understanding or making sense of where we are right now.

Under his watch, Angola became sub-Saharan Africa's second-largest oil producer \u2014 but the wealth never reached the people. LISBON, Portugal \u2014 Jos\u00e9 Eduardo dos Santos, once one of Africa's longest-serving rulers who during almost four decades as president of Angola fought the continent's longest civil war and turned his country into a major oil producer as well as one of the world's poorest and most corrupt nations, died Friday. He was 79. Dos Santos died at a clinic in Barcelona, Spain, following a long illness, the Angolan government said in an announcement on its Facebook page. The announcement said dos Santos was \"a statesman of great historical scale who governed ... the Angolan nation through very difficult times.\" Dos Santos had mostly lived in Barcelona since stepping down in 2017 and had been undergoing treatment there for health problems. Angola's current head of state, Jo\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o, announced five days of national mourning starting Saturday, when the country's flag will fly at half-staff and public events are canceled. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres recalled dos Santos' participation in the struggle that led to Angola's independence and his leadership \"through the signing of the peace agreement that put an end to the civil war in 2002,\" his spokesman said. \"During his tenure, Angola became an important regional and international partner and advocate for multilateralism.\" The U.N. Security Council stood in silent tribute to dos Santos at the start of a meeting Friday after the current council president, Brazil's U.N. Ambassador Ronaldo Costa Filho expressed its \"sadness\" at his death. Dos Santos came to power four years after Angola gained independence from Portugal and became enmeshed in the Cold War as a proxy battlefield. His political journey spanned single-party Marxist rule in post-colonial years and a democratic system of government adopted in 2008. He voluntarily stepped down when his health began failing. In public, dos Santos was unassuming and even appeared shy at times. But he was a shrewd operator behind the scenes. He kept a tight grip on the 17th-century presidential palace in Luanda, the southern African country's Atlantic capital, by distributing Angola's wealth between his army generals and political rivals to ensure their loyalty. He demoted anyone he perceived to be gaining a level of popularity that could threaten his command. Dos Santos' greatest foe for more than two decades was Jonas Savimbi, leader of the UNITA rebels whose post-independence guerrilla insurgency fought in the bush aimed to oust dos Santos' Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola, or MPLA. The MPLA had financial support from the Soviet Union and military support from Cuba in its war against UNITA. Savimbi was backed by the United States and South Africa. The war would last, with brief periods of U.N.-brokered peace, until 2002 when the army finally tracked down Savimbi in eastern Angola and killed him. Dos Santos abruptly shed his Marxist policies after the collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s. He moved closer to Western countries, whose oil companies invested billions of dollars in mostly offshore exploration. His supporters praised his ability to adapt to changing circumstances. His critics called him unscrupulous. Dos Santos was invited to the White House in 2004 by then-president George W. Bush as the United States has looked to reduce its dependence on oil from the Middle East. Angola became sub-Saharan Africa's second-largest oil producer after Nigeria, producing close to 2 million barrels per day. It also unearthed more than $1 billion worth of diamonds each year. However, the wealth never reached the Angolan people, who during and after the civil war were at risk from large areas of unmapped minefields and had little access to basic amenities, such as running water or roads. Education and health care were \u2014 and remain \u2014 sparse. More than $4 billion in oil revenue vanished from Angolan state coffers between 1997 and 2002, New York-based Human Rights Watch said in a 2004 report, based on an analysis of figures from the International Monetary Fund. The U.S. State Department said that wealth in Angola is \"concentrated in the hands of a small elite, who often used government positions for massive personal enrichment.\" Dos Santos was believed to own valuable real estate in Brazil, France and Portugal, as well as foreign bank accounts. Under his rule, and despite the general poverty, street protests were rare and quickly broken up by the heavily armed riot police known popularly as \"Ninjas.\" A well-paid and well-equipped presidential guard was garrisoned inside dos Santos's palace and lined the city's grimy, potholed streets whenever he emerged. A bricklayer's son from Luanda, Angola's coastal capital, dos Santos began his political life with boots and a rifle in 1961 as an 18-year-old guerrilla for the MLPA in the fight for independence from Portugal. MPLA bosses pulled him from combat in 1963 and sent him to the Soviet Union for training as a petroleum engineer and military communications specialist. When he returned to Angola in 1970, he skillfully negotiated compromises to keep the MPLA from breaking up into splinter groups and as a reward was appointed to the party's central committee. When independence arrived in 1975, dos Santos became foreign minister and later planning minister and deputy prime minister in the single-party Marxist state. In a surprise choice, the MPLA elected dos Santos at 37 as president upon the death of Agostinho Neto, Angola's first leader, in 1979. Dos Santos was seen as a consensus figure between squabbling party veterans, but few anticipated his political longevity. Dos Santos never sought to establish a personality cult and remained a mysterious figure. He reportedly once said in private he felt his true vocation was that of a monk. Nor was he known for political sensitivity: He built a multimillion-dollar mansion on the fringe of a Luanda shantytown while millions of Angolans were fighting starvation during the civil war. He was considered a sure loser against Savimbi in the country's first democratic elections in 1992, following a peace treaty signed the previous year. Margaret Anstee, a former U.N. special representative to Angola, described dos Santos as being almost the opposite of Savimbi. \"His demeanor was grave and reserved, to the point that I traced a sense of shyness or timidity, absurd as this seemed. The contrast with Dr. Savimbi's flamboyant personality could not have been more vivid,\" she wrote in her 1996 book on Angola entitled \"Orphan of the Cold War.\" But in further evidence of his staying power dos Santos held on again, narrowly outpolling Savimbi for president while leading the MPLA to a parliamentary majority in the simultaneous legislative election. When Savimbi rejected his defeat at the ballot box and returned to his armed struggle, Western support gradually swung behind dos Santos. The foes signed another peace deal, brokered by the United Nations, in 1994, but that also unraveled four years later. Meanwhile, dos Santos \u2014 with an army of around 100,000 troops, many with years of jungle combat experience \u2014 essayed a role as a regional power broker, starting with neighboring countries. He sent 2,500 troops to Republic of Congo in 1997 to help President Denis Sassou-Nguesso seize power and the following year sent a contingent to Congo to help President Laurent Kabila's government fight rebels backed by Rwanda and Uganda. The end of Angola's civil war in 2002 brought an opportunity for broader economic development in the southern African country, which is more than three times the size of California. But public infrastructure was devastated; 4 million people \u2014 about one-third of the population at the time \u2014 had fled their homes because of the fighting; and oil and diamond wealth continued in the hands of the political and military elite. Berlin-based Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index 2005 named Angola as one of the world's 10 most corrupt countries. \"As land mine-maimed children begged in the streets, politicians' wives flew to New York on the government health budget for nip-and-tuck cosmetic surgery,\" wrote John McMillan, a Stanford University economics professor, in a 2005 study on Angolan corruption. Under pressure to finally hold a ballot, dos Santos announced legislative elections in 2008 and a presidential election the following year. Dos Santos's MPLA won the most votes for parliamentary seats. But then the head of state changed tack, first postponing the presidential ballot and then scrapping it. He altered the constitution so that the president is chosen by the party which wins the parliamentary elections. That kept him in power for another eight years. However, with his health reportedly worsening, Dos Santos announced in 2016 he would retire. He was replaced by Louren\u00e7o, an MPLA stalwart, who has made an anti-corruption drive his flagship policy. He has targeted dos Santos' grown children, who possess fabulous personal wealth, but not his predecessor. The change in fortune for dos Santos's family has prompted one of his daughters to suspect that a conspiracy was behind her father's illness and death. Spanish prosecutors and police are looking into allegations by Tchiz\u00e9 dos Santos that people close to the ex-president have tried to kill him, failed to care for him properly and acted negligently. Dos Santos, who was married four times, was survived by his current wife, Ana Paula, by whom he had three children. He is known to have at least three other children and various grandchildren.",

Jamie Raskin became a member of the House select committee looking into the Jan. 6 attacks. A year ago, Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., experienced two unimaginable traumas in the span of a single week. On New Year's Eve 2020, his son Tommy, 25, died by suicide after years of fighting mental illness. Then, on Jan. 6, 2021, just a day after Tommy's funeral, Raskin was at work in the U.S. Capitol with his daughter and son-in-law when a violent mob stormed the building in an attempt to overturn the results of the presidential election. If you or someone you know may be considering suicide, contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 (en Espa\u00f1ol: 1-888-628-9454; deaf and hard of hearing: 1-800-799-4889) or the Crisis Text Line by texting HOME to 741741. In his new memoir, Unthinkable, Raskin reflects on his continuing efforts to understand those two traumatic events. There was a time, he says, when \"I wasn't sure whether I was ever going to be able to do anything again.\" Then House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., asked him to serve as the lead manager in the second impeachment trial of President Donald Trump. Looking back now, Raskin sees Pelosi's request as a lifeline. \"I was forced to galvanize all of my love for Tommy and my daughters, Hannah and Tabitha, and my wife, Sarah, and our family and our country, and to throw myself into the trial to make the case that Donald Trump had incited this violent insurrection in an effort to overthrow the 2020 presidential election,\" Raskin says. I personally felt no fear because the very worst thing that ever could have happened to me had already happened to me. Rep. Jamie Raskin Raskin knew that leading the impeachment trial would likely result in death threats, but he pushed on. \"I personally felt no fear, because the very worst thing that ever could have happened to me had already happened to me,\" he says.  \"And so my feeling to the people who want to take down our democracy is that they're not going to scare me out of doing my job.\" Trump's second impeachment trial ended in acquittal in February 2021. Now Raskin is serving on the House select committee charged with investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection, the events leading up to it and the people behind it. \"I've never been on a more effective and serious bipartisan committee than [this] select committee,\" he says. \"We don't spend all of our time in partisan polemics and food fights. ... We're going to get to the answers and I'm going to report them this year to the American people, because the people deserve it. It's all about the future of our country.\" Unthinkable, by Rep. Jamie Raskin\n                \n                    \n                    Harper Collins\n                    \n                \nhide caption On how the past year changed him This whole thing has been such an episode of cognitive dissonance for me, because people will tell you that before we lost Tommy, before Jan. 6, I was the happiest, funniest member of Congress you could ever care to meet. I have a colleague, Abigail Spanberger from Virginia, who was once asked on C-SPAN, \"Who's the funniest member of Congress?\" And it was my greatest achievement that she said, \"Oh, no question: Jamie Raskin.\" And that's who I was. And suddenly I was just thrust into a world of complete tragedy and pain, and [then] the madness of the insurrection and the attack on our system of government. On his son Tommy's heightened sensitivity and empathy From a very young age, he was an enormously sensitive person. He felt the pain of other people and of animals in a way that certainly I had never seen before, and [which] people describe as unique. He would read an article in the newspaper about the civil war in Yemen and the hunger of children there, or about children who were displaced in Iraq, and it would stay with him the entire day and he would think about it, and then he would get in touch with groups that were working on it. He felt these things like these people were members of our family. So he was an extraordinary empath and had this overwhelming sense of responsibility for the world. And so these episodes of war and civil war and famine and hunger and violence, it struck him really hard. That was just in his nature. ... [The pandemic] was intensely isolating and demoralizing for a lot of young people and for someone who's struggling already with depression or some other kind of mental or emotional illness, it can become unbearable, and it did become unbearable in Tommy's case. \"From a very young age, [Tommy] was an enormously sensitive person,\" Raskin says.\n                \n                    \n                    Courtesy of the Raskin family\n                    \n                \nhide caption \"From a very young age, [Tommy] was an enormously sensitive person,\" Raskin says. On why he and his wife keep Tommy's suicide note out so they see it every day It's definitely the first thing I look at every morning, and for me, it's like \"how to\" instructions for how to live. [It reads:] \"Look after each other and the animals. Don't forget the animals and the global poor.\" ... Tommy never stopped looking at that level of the Maslow hierarchy of needs. He understood there are people who could focus on nothing other than where their next meal is coming from. Or how are they going to be safe from violence? Or how do they get out of a war zone? And so before we think about, OK, how are we going to get people on trips to Mars and stuff like that? We've got to be thinking about people who are just struggling to survive, even at a subsistence level. On how he thinks of the events of Jan. 6 The way that I conceive of what happened on Jan. 6 is that there were three rings of activity. In one ring was a mass demonstration ... a \"wild\" protest [called for] by Donald Trump that turned into a riot. And that's the outer ring that included tens of thousands of people. The middle ring was the ring of the insurrection itself, and that was the Proud Boys, the Oath Keepers, the Three Percenters, the Aryan Nations, the militia groups, the QAnon networks, the organized militant political extremist groups that showed up, many of them having trained for weeks for this event. [These were] the first people to break our windows, attack our officers, injure people and help turn the demonstration into a riot. But the very inner ring, the inner core of it, was the realm of the coup. And it's a weird word for us to use in American political parlance, because we don't have any experience with coups and we think of coups as being things undertaken against presidents, but this was a coup perpetrated by the president, against the vice president and against the Congress. And that was an attempt to essentially steal away the presidential election results and to preserve himself in power for another four years. On using the term \"coup\" This is what the political scientists call a \"self-coup,\" where you have an incumbent president or officeholder who thwarts the electoral process and circumvents the general constitutional rules in order to entrench himself into power. So this would have been a textbook example of a self-coup by a president who is fearing being ousted in an election as Donald Trump was and then tries to galvanize the different levers of power to keep himself in. On what documents show about Trump watching the insurrection happen and doing nothing We're talking about really the most serious offense ever committed by a president of the United States against his own government and his own people. Rep. Jamie Raskin We have had now multiple reports of people making entreaties to Donald Trump to call off the dogs, but him refusing to do so. And that is obviously proof positive of his incitement and what his purpose was in inciting. But it also demonstrates his role in helping to propagate the violence. So that's very serious business. We're talking about really the most serious offense ever committed by a president of the United States against his own government and his own people. On Trump's culpability for the Jan. 6 insurrection Donald Trump was impeached by the House of Representatives for the high crime and misdemeanor of inciting violent insurrection against the union, and [the impeachment officers] took the position, which we continue to hold, that if that is not a high crime and misdemeanor against the government, then nothing is. If you can actually incite a violent attack on your own government and that's not impeachable, then you basically don't believe in impeachment. You've just basically nullified the whole process. And 57 senators to 43 agreed that he had engaged in that conduct. So I believe he's been convicted in the court of public opinion, and I believe he's been convicted in the eyes of history and in the eyes of the world. In terms of criminal actions, of course that's not up to us, but there are a number of criminal offenses that potentially apply in a situation like this, including interference with a federal proceeding, conspiracy to do that, seditious conspiracy. So, you know, there are probably a dozen different offenses. I mean that violent insurrection destroyed federal property, costing us millions and millions of dollars. Was there a conspiracy to make that happen? All of these things are, again, not within the province of the Jan. 6 select committee, but would be appropriate to be considered by the Department of Justice.

Republicans have denounced the shooting \u2014 but not the language he used about immigration.

It's a baseless and racist conspiracy theory that powerful elites are trying to replace white Americans with nonwhites and that these elites are allowing a so-called invasion of nonwhite immigrants. That word, invasion, has been used a lot lately by some Republicans and immigration hard-liners. And as NPR's Joel Rose reports, some are resisting calls to drop it. JOEL ROSE, BYLINE: If you've been following Republicans in Congress lately, you've probably heard them frame the influx of migrants at the southern border this way. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE) RALPH NORMAN: This is an invasion of this country. MIKE JOHNSON: We have a literal invasion of lawless masses flooding over our border from more than 160 countries. LOUIE GOHMERT: The federal government is going to keep the states free from invasion. That hasn't happened. ROSE: That's Republican Congressmen Ralph Norman of South Carolina, Mike Johnson of Louisiana and Louie Gohmert of Texas during hearings last month. The number of migrants apprehended at the border has climbed to some of the highest totals on record. But virtually all of those migrants are unarmed and fleeing from violence and poverty. Immigrant advocates say calling that an invasion is inflammatory, even dangerous. They say the Buffalo gunman isn't the first mass shooter to allegedly say that he was trying to kill so-called invaders. And they're calling for everyone to stop describing migrants this way. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) VERONICA ESCOBAR: These words are powerful. And we have seen the impact of those words on my community. ROSE: That's Democratic Congresswoman Veronica Escobar on a call with reporters last week. She represents the district in El Paso, Texas, where a white gunman opened fire in a Walmart almost three years ago, trying to turn back what he called, quote, \"an invasion of Hispanics.\" (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ESCOBAR: The pain doesn't go away, and the consequences of this hatred is far-reaching. ROSE: Republicans across the board have denounced the shootings in El Paso and Buffalo. But they're not all rejecting the language or the ideas that motivated those shooters. A growing number of Republicans argue that the Biden administration is deliberately allowing migrants to enter the country so that they can vote for Democrats. Here's the third-ranking House Republican Elise Stefanik of New York speaking last week to talk radio host Bo Snerdley. (SOUNDBITE OF RADIO SHOW, \"THE BO SNERDLEY SHOW\") ELISE STEFANIK: They're actually saying that one of the reasons they want to pursue mass amnesty is for electoral and political purposes. We've seen this in New York City in the municipal elections. ROSE: Democrats and immigrant advocates say that's a false conspiracy theory. It's true that New York City is set to allow noncitizens with legal work authorization to vote in local elections, but only citizens can vote in federal races. Meanwhile, the Biden administration has deported and expelled millions of migrants under border policies put in place by former President Trump. Still, some Republicans are doubling down and defending their use of the word invasion to describe the situation at the border. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KEN CUCCINELLI: This is not intended to be inflammatory, but it is the legally correct terminology. The fact that it's relatively peaceful doesn't change the fact that it is still an invasion. ROSE: Ken Cuccinelli was a top Homeland Security official during the Trump administration, where he was very involved in immigration policy. He's now at the Center for Renewing America. Cuccinelli argues that border states have the right under the Constitution to repel a, quote, \"invasion of migrants,\" a position he reiterated on a call with reporters last week. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CUCCINELLI: The Biden administration is inviting this invasion of the United States. And so the border states have the authority to respond and repel that invasion and return people back across their borders with Mexico. ROSE: So far, no border state governor has taken Cuccinelli's advice to literally declare an invasion. But as a metaphor, that framing is already mainstream. And immigrant advocates worry it's just a matter of time before it leads to violence again. Joel Rose, NPR News, Washington. Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.  All rights reserved.

DAVE DAVIES, HOST: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies, in for Terry Gross, who's off this week. U.S. Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer has decided to retire, giving President Biden the opportunity to fulfill his promise of naming a Black woman to the nation's highest court. Our guest today, New Yorker staff writer Jane Mayer, has identified another development involving the Supreme Court that some legal scholars believe may undermine the integrity of the institution. Her latest article is about the conservative activism and influence of Ginni Thomas, wife of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. Mayer reports that Ginni Thomas holds extreme right-wing views. She's been supportive of Donald Trump's baseless claims that the 2020 election was stolen, and she's said that the country faces existential danger from the deep state and the fascist left. She has an active lobbying firm and has ties to many groups that have an interest in cases that may come before the court. One example - on Monday, the court agreed to consider whether race-conscious admissions programs at Harvard and the University of North Carolina are lawful, raising the prospect that the court's conservative supermajority could roll back affirmative action in higher education. Ginni Thomas is on the advisory board of the National Association of Scholars, a conservative group that has filed an amicus brief in the Harvard case. Mayer also talks to legal scholars who raise concerns about Ginni Thomas' activities. Many say there's a pressing need for clearer rules to govern the conduct of Supreme Court justices and their families. Well, Jane Mayer, welcome back to FRESH AIR. JANE MAYER: Thanks so much. Great to be with you. DAVIES: I thought before we talk about Ginni Thomas' specific activities, we might talk a bit about what rules or standards should apply to this. I mean, we live in an age where people's spouses have careers. And, you know, everybody has a right to express their political views and a right to engage in lawful business activities. Now, we know that public officials are often bound by ethics codes in states and localities, and they generally provide that, you know, you can't use your power as a public official to bestow a financial benefit on yourself or a member of your immediate family, right? You can't award a contract to your husband or wife's firm because that's a little too close. It gives you a financial interest besides the public good. But what about judges? What rules, if any, apply to judges? MAYER: Well, there are actually very specific rules applying to judges' spouses and family members. But what's interesting is that these rules apply to all judges who are in the federal system except for those on the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court holds itself as above all the rest of the judges and above the judicial code. Because it is the highest sort of judicial voice in the country, the point that has been made - it was actually made a number of years ago by Justice Rehnquist - was that nobody can enforce the law on it because it is basically the law itself, and so it is outside of the judicial code that binds the rest of the judges. There's sort of two sets of rules. One is very specific about not being able to judge any kind of case in which your spouse is, for instance, arguing the case or has a financial interest in the case or some other interest in the case. You are supposed to step aside and recuse yourself, rather than sit in judgment of something that involves your direct family member, spouse or a kid in your family. And there's the second rule. You also are supposed to recuse yourself if there might be the appearance of a conflict of interest, even if it's not an actual conflict. If it's something, a situation, that might make a reasonable person who knows the facts think that you as a judge can't be impartial, you should step aside. And the reason there's an appearance test is because, in this country, the thinking has been that the appearance of justice is just as important as the fact of justice, that it's incredibly important in a democracy that the public trusts the courts and thinks that the judges are not corrupt. So there's this appearance test. But all of those rules are optional for the Supreme Court judges, except for the most extreme cases where, for instance, if a Supreme Court justice - if his spouse was literally involved in a case in front of them, it would be clear that he'd have to step aside. But there's a ton of gray ground for the Supreme Court that is black and white for every other judge in this country. DAVIES: Right. So the standard for the other judges, not the justices, is not just a financial benefit standard. It's - if the circumstances would raise a question which would undermine the court's sense of impartiality, that's a problem. Are there financial disclosures required of Supreme Court justices? MAYER: So there are. The Supreme Court falls under the Ethics in Government Act, as do other branches of the government, and that requires that the Supreme Court justices disclose some things about their financial interests, publicly. But the actual rules are interpreted by the sort of administrative offices of the courts, and it's kind of, again, sort of an honor system. The justices take care of this themselves. And for the most part, they disclose quite a bit about all of the stocks and things that are in their portfolios. But there's a glitch in it, and that's what I came across in writing about Ginni Thomas. She appears to have a private business, a consulting business, where - at least the way that Justice Thomas has been interpreting the rules, where she can take clients and not have to publicly disclose who they are. They can pay her an undisclosed amount of money, and all that's on the forms for the public to see is that she earns some undisclosed amount of money from her firm. So basically, anybody who wants to give money to a Supreme Court justice could pay the spouse as a client, and nobody would know in the public. DAVIES: Nobody would know from the justice's financial disclosure forms. And that's not fudging it. The law doesn't require that - the rules don't require that? MAYER: It appears not. I've been interviewing lots of people about it. And they - there's just a lot of murk there. It's clear from, you know, having interviewed tons of people about this that there needs to be some clarification here because it appears to be kind of a - as I said, kind of a glitch or a loophole. I mean, for the most part, the justices, as I said, self-enforce and self-disclose. But what I came across in doing this reporting was an instance where, just because I bumped into one of these client's finances, I could see that Ginni Thomas had earned something like $200,000 from a specific person who had an interest in front of the court and that none of this was disclosed in Justice Thomas' financial disclosures. DAVIES: So I'd like you to give us a sense of Ginni Thomas' political views. You write that a lot of Americans first became aware of her views on January 6, 2021. Why? MAYER: On that morning, which was the morning of the sort of - the big gathering for the Stop the Steal rallies in Washington that were protesting the legitimacy of Biden's election. That morning, Ginni Thomas went online and posted some comments that drew a ton of attention because she basically cheered on the protesters and sided with those who were claiming that the election was stolen. She said, you know, that God bless them and such. And, you know, it was interesting to many people because it sort of placed her in the far-Trump base, right-wing Trump base, when she did that. Then, of course, those protests turned into a violent storming of the Capitol that we've all seen. And after that, there was sort of two days gap, and she then amended her post to say that she had made - sort of a disclaimer saying, well, it was posted before the violence. DAVIES: I mentioned in my introduction that you wrote that Ginni Thomas has said that the country faces existential danger from the deep state and fascist left. Where does that come from? MAYER: I've listened to a number of her speeches now. There's an organization called Documented that somehow has put online a number of her speeches, so others can check them out themselves if they want to see. And her tone is warlike. She basically talks about - in one speech about how the enemies of America, who she defines as the left, are trying to kill people like herself. And she uses that word kill twice. She talks about how important it is to be able to have guns, and she says, you know, I hope we all have them, and I hope we'll all be able to carry concealed weapons soon. It's a very martial and aggressive kind of tone she takes - somewhat paranoid, I would say. She seems to feel persecuted a lot of the time. And so she sees enemies everywhere. I interviewed someone who is in one of these groups with her who said, basically - first of all, he said that he didn't want to speak on the record because he described Ginni Thomas as \"volatile,\" quote, unquote, and said that the best way to describe her, he thought, was tribal. He said she's - basically sees the world as either you're part of her little group or you're an enemy. So she has a kind of a divisive worldview. DAVIES: There's an organization called Groundswell. You want to explain what it is and what Ginni Thomas' role is? MAYER: Yeah. This is a group that Ginni Thomas helped found a number of years ago. I think it goes back at least till 2013, and it still exists. She describes herself as the chairman of Groundswell. It's kind of an online network, a secret network of right-wing activists who are trying to coordinate with conservative members of Congress and their staff and conservative members of the media and quite a few other activists. And they, during the Trump administration, played a really unusual role and, I think, one that raised a lot of eyebrows even inside the Trump White House, which was that they compiled a list of people that they claimed were disloyal members of the so-called deep state who were, they thought, not going along enough with Trump. And they brought this list to the White House and delivered it to Trump and said that basically these people need to be fired. And they presented what they said were better people, their friends, who should be hired. And this was - Ginni Thomas was kind of described as the tip of the spear of this by somebody else. So you can again see this as a speech online where someone named Rachel Bovard says about Ginni Thomas, she's been the tip of the spear in this movement to purge the Trump administration of deep-state actors. DAVIES: And do we know of specific people that they targeted or that were removed or denied jobs? MAYER: Well, one of the people that they went after very harshly was H.R. McMaster, the former national security adviser to Trump, who they felt was not hawkish enough and not pro-Trump enough. And they thought that he secretly didn't support Trump, so they tried to get rid of him. And they actually - it was a kind of crazy sort of caper. There was an effort to plan a sting that would have involved setting McMaster up. They had undercover women who were going to try to meet with him in a restaurant and get him to sort of loosen up and say inappropriate things about Trump, and they were going to surreptitiously tape him. But as it turned out, McMaster resigned before that ever took place. DAVIES: We need to take a break here. Let me reintroduce you. We are speaking with Jane Mayer. She's a staff writer and chief Washington correspondent for The New Yorker. Her latest article is \"Is Ginni Thomas A Threat To The Supreme Court?\" We'll continue our conversation in just a moment. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF DAN AUERBACH SONG, \u201cHEARTBROKEN, IN DISREPAIR\u201d) DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR, and we're speaking with New Yorker, staff writer and chief Washington correspondent Jane Mayer. Her latest article examines the conservative activism and influence of Ginni Thomas, wife of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. Let's just talk a little bit about Ginni Thomas' background. She grew up in Nebraska. What do we know about her family? MAYER: Well, she grew up in a kind of upper-middle-class family in Omaha, Neb. Her father was a engineer and a developer of sort of housing complexes. And her family was very conservative and very active in politics. And one of the people I interviewed is the journalist Kurt Andersen, who grew up exactly across the street from the Lamp family. Her name before she got married was Virginia Lamp. And he said that his parents were actually Goldwater Republicans. But even they thought the Lamps were - what he said was crazy. They were - he looks at them as kind of the beginning of the modern, crazy right wing. They believed in things like the John Birch Society, and they were afraid that there was fluoridation in the water that was somehow poisoning people's minds - that kind of thing. DAVIES: She makes her way to Washington. How does she get there and - I don't know. Her life took some interesting detours there; didn't they? MAYER: Yeah, it did. She went to Washington with the local congressman when he was elected. Her family knew him, and she got a job in his office. But it looks like she had sort of some rocky years. She was a law student. She flunked the bar exam, the state bar exam in Nebraska, and she sort of fell in with a self-help sort of self-actualization kind of cult called Lifespring in Washington, where the members kind of got into ritual humiliation of each other. They'd strip down out of their clothes and then mock each other's body fat. And it sounded grim and kind of scary. But anyway, she was then deprogrammed, got out of it, became anti-cult. But that was a phase of her life before she met Clarence Thomas. DAVIES: Yeah, you know, I think most of us would not want to be judged by the - many of the things we did in our 20s. Do you think that this tells us anything important about Ginni Thomas? MAYER: You know, I look at it, and like you, I say, you know, people - all kinds of things happen to people as they grow up, and, you know, you try to - try not to be too judgmental about people - at least I try not to be. But I think, you know, it's interesting to me. It sort of raises questions about her gullibility and her susceptibility to extreme ideas. You know, you can see that in her possibly. DAVIES: She meets Clarence Thomas. They are ideologically in sync. They marry in 1987. And of course, when he is nominated to the Supreme Court, he has the most memorable confirmation hearings. Anita Hill accused him of sexual harassment. He was confirmed. You wrote a terrific book about this, by the way - \"Strange Justice\" is the name - with Jill Abramson. What do you know about the - you know, Ginni Thomas was with him then. What do you know about the impact of that experience on their relationship and her political development? MAYER: You know, this is sort of where I entered this story, many years ago during those hearings, covering them and then writing that book. And I think that single event must have been completely traumatic for both Clarence Thomas and Ginni Thomas, and in some ways, I suspect from reading a lot about them that neither of them have ever really recovered from it. Ginni Thomas has described it as like going through a fiery furnace. And the two of them were very much welded together by it. Even before that, Clarence Thomas had been described as listening to Ginni Thomas more than anybody else. It was the one person that he listened to, according to his friends. But after that, I think both of them had just pronounced bitterness towards the mainstream press, towards liberals who had questioned them and certainly towards anybody who believed that Anita Hill told the truth. And that is more than half the country at this point. DAVIES: So when Justice Thomas ascended to the high court, where did Ginni Thomas' professional life go? MAYER: So she apparently felt quite stuck and stymied by the fact that he went on the Supreme Court. She had harbored ambitions of running for Congress, but when he went on the Supreme Court, she felt she really couldn't do that, and she felt somewhat stuck and stymied. She cycled through a number of different positions in kind of conservative institutions. She worked for the Heritage Foundation, which is a conservative think tank. And she tried to open up a kind of nonprofit group that got her into a lot of trouble because it was very much involved in advocating strong political positions on the right that conflicted with the ability of her husband to have a neutral position on cases. So she gave that up and eventually opened up her own little political lobbying firm called Liberty Consulting. That was in about, I think, 2011. And it's also been the source of a lot of controversy. DAVIES: Is it a one-person shop? Does she have a staff? Does she hire other lobbyists? Do you know? MAYER: It's a one-woman shop. I think she's got maybe one assistant that I know of. You can see from its sort of incorporation papers, it's just a little place. If you look up its address online, it's just a mailbox. DAVIES: And what do we know of its work and its clients? MAYER: Well, we don't - you know, it's hard to find out. But she has a website, and on it she boasts that she can get access to any door in Washington. And she has a number of clients, former clients and other supporters, who tout her skills. And it's hard to tell which ones have been clients of hers or which ones are just supporters. But they include a kind of - they run the gamut of the far-right wing, including one of the organizers of the January 6 Stop the Steal protests, somebody named Kimberly Fletcher. DAVIES: You know, a lot of states have - and cities have lobbying statutes which require that people who hire lobbyists state that, state who the lobbyist is, in some cases how much they pay them. Does she have to disclose anything about her clients in public filings? MAYER: If she were following the law and lobbying somebody in the executive branch or Congress, she would have to register as a lobbyist. She has not registered as a lobbyist. You know, there's a certain amount of sort of gray area in there. So she has not disclosed or registered herself as a lobbyist in any formal way. DAVIES: We're speaking with Jane Mayer. She is a staff writer and chief Washington correspondent for The New Yorker. Her latest article in the magazine is titled \"Is Ginni Thomas A Threat To The Supreme Court?\" We'll continue our conversation after this short break. I'm Dave Davies, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies in for Terry Gross, who's off this week. Our guest is New Yorker staff writer and chief Washington correspondent Jane Mayer. Her latest article examines the conservative activism and influence of Ginni Thomas, the wife of Clarence Thomas, the longest-serving member of the U.S. Supreme Court. Ginni Thomas has a lobbying firm and ties to many conservative groups that have an interest in cases before the court. Some legal scholars say that undermines confidence in the court, which is not bound by the code of conduct that applies to lower courts in the federal system. So, Jane Mayer, one of the things you write about is that Ginni Thomas often has connections to people or organizations that would file amicus briefs in Supreme Court cases. Let's talk about this. First of all, just explain what an amicus brief is. MAYER: So amicus briefs are so-called friend-of-the-court briefs. They're basically outsiders to the case who are joining the case by saying they support one side or the other. They're taking a position on the cases in front of the court. And there are a ton of amicus briefs at the Supreme Court these days. It's kind of an unwatched area that's exploding. And the reason, according to experts that I interviewed, is that it's become a form of lobbying. As the Supreme Court takes on all of these really important political issues in front of the country, the interests and the outside groups are filing amicus briefs in order to sort of put their thumb on the scale of justice and push on one side or another. And a lot of these briefs are actually filed by groups where you can't see who's funding them. It's another kind of form of dark money spending. And there's a push on - in Congress to try to get more sort of disclosure and transparency of it. But meanwhile, there are kind of private interests pouring money into the court by filing these amicus briefs. DAVIES: Can anybody file an amicus brief, and does the court have to take it into consideration? MAYER: The court has to accept the amicus briefs. So I think, you know, if it was a, you know, somebody who didn't have any particular standing or reason to be involved, they can strike those briefs. But basically, both sides of the case also have to accept them. DAVIES: When you say they strike them, is that a formal filing that's filed with the court? We got this amicus brief. We don't regard it as - what? - meaningful, qualified. MAYER: Because they're - these amicus briefs have become increasingly controversial, there was a new rule passed in 2018 for appellate judges that enables them to strike any amicus brief that presents a conflict of interest to them. Rather than having this conflict in front of them and a brief that's submitted by someone that they may know too well, such as a spouse or a group that a spouse is involved in, they can say, don't file that brief. We're not going to accept that brief. But the Supreme Court is just loaded with amicus briefs. There's been a kind of a linear increase in the number of them since World War II. And what I found was just an astounding number of them have connections to Ginni Thomas. DAVIES: You know, what's fascinating is that it sort of makes a Supreme Court case almost like a legislative hearing where, you know, Congress or a state legislature will say, yeah, anybody who thinks there's important information we should know about this proposed law, come sit down, get sworn in and tell us what you have to say. But a court case is a little different. It's sort of - it's almost, like, becoming more like a legislative process if... MAYER: It's very much politicizing the Supreme Court. And what's interesting, according to some of the people that I interviewed who study these things, is that they have influenced these amicus briefs, because there is a study that shows that, increasingly, the justices are quoting from them in their opinions. So just like - as if a lobbyist was writing the legislation for a lawmaker, these outside lobbyists who are submitting briefs are beginning to have their words incorporated into the opinions that the Supreme Court issues. DAVIES: Now, you cite many circumstances in which conservative groups or individuals that Ginni Thomas has some association with have filed amicus briefs before the court that her husband sits on. I thought we would look at one case, and this involves Frank Gaffney. You want to explain who he is? MAYER: Sure. He's a well-known figure in Washington. He's a very, very outspoken defense hawk who has, over the years, been vociferous in his fear that Muslims are posing an existential threat to America. DAVIES: And what connection does Ginni Thomas have with him? MAYER: Well, he has a - sort of a advocacy group that's called the Center for Security Policy. And in 2017 and 2018, according to filings that he submitted to the IRS, he hired Ginni Thomas' consulting group, each year, for over $100,000, to work for him. She was earning a decent chunk of change from Frank Gaffney in 2017 and 2018 from his nonprofit. He, meanwhile - this is where it begins to get - sort of the plot thickens and it gets concerning - is that he, meanwhile, was very much advocating publicly for Trump's so-called Muslim ban that was going to try to exclude Muslim countries from having immigrants come to the United States. He was advocating publicly for that ban, and, privately, he was part of a group that submitted an amicus brief in front of the court when that ban was being considered by the Supreme Court. So Ginni Thomas is working for someone, as it turns out, and making money from someone who has joined a case in front of her husband. But nobody could see this at the time. You have to really kind of, you know, put on your green eyeshades to find it. DAVIES: And an interesting question is, where would Frank Gaffney and his organization get the $200,000 or more that they used to hire Ginni Thomas as a lobbyist? And you did some reporting on this. What did you discover? MAYER: Yeah. Good question. Where does the Center for Security Policy find the cash to pay over a hundred thousand a year to Ginni Thomas' consulting firm? It's just a little nonprofit. So where's this coming from? And if you push back further and kind of, you know, turn the rocks over further, what you find is that Gaffney's center was funded by a political group which was chaired by Rebekah Mercer, the sort of well-known Trump backer. She's an heiress and part of the Mercer family that's made tons of money on Wall Street. And she's backed all kinds of Trump causes and Trump's election. And so what you can see is the money has gone from Trump backers to the Gaffney nonprofit and from that to Ginni Thomas' consulting firm. And there you've got the wife of a Supreme Court justice basically receiving these funds that are one step removed from Trump backers while her husband is sitting in judgment of Trump's policies. It's just - as one of the legal scholars I interviewed, David Luban, said, it's slicing the baloney a little bit too thin. DAVIES: And we should just note that the group which provided this money to Gaffney's organization, which is headed by Rebekah Mercer, is called Making America Great or Make America Great, right? MAYER: It was called Making America Great. DAVIES: OK. So - right. So we have a case here not simply of ideological alignment. It is no surprise that Ginni Thomas and Frank Gaffney might hold the position that they have held with respect to the Muslim travel ban. But now we have this movement of money from an active pro-Trump group to a private advocacy organization, to Ginni Thomas' one-person lobbying firm while this case is before the court. Wow. You know, it may be that Clarence Thomas would have voted the way he voted, to uphold the Muslim ban, anyway. Not hard to imagine that. But I suppose other parties in the case might like to at least have known that these arrangements were afoot, did they? MAYER: No. I don't think anybody knew at the time other than the Thomases, maybe, you know, and Frank Gaffney. No. And, you know, of course, the other side would like to know that there's - that the justice's family was being paid by somebody who had filed an amicus brief. But there was no disclosure of this. And as you say, given Clarence Thomas' record and his point of view, he might very well have upheld that Muslim ban anyway. He certainly did vote for it over and over again. He was one of the most consistent supporters of Trump policies. But it's the aura, again, that we get back to here, which is the image problem, the appearance of a conflict of interest that undermines the public confidence that the court is ruling in favor of justice rather than in favor of a justice's pocketbook. DAVIES: And just this one little detail - I mean, Justice Thomas is required to file annual financial disclosure statements. Should these payments have appeared on that disclosure? MAYER: So I spoke with experts in this subject. Like, there's somebody named Gabe Roth, who has a group called Fix the Court. It's a nonpartisan group. And it's trying to get more public disclosure of this kind of thing. And he said, absolutely. He thinks that, you know, Justice Thomas should amend the financial disclosure, put out more information on this and also that there needs to be some reform in these rules so that justices are required to recuse if their family members are involved in amicus briefs in front of the court. DAVIES: Let me reintroduce you here. We're going to take another break. We are speaking with Jane Mayer. She is a staff writer and chief Washington correspondent for The New Yorker. Her latest article in the magazine is titled \"Is Ginni Thomas A Threat To The Supreme Court?\" We'll continue our conversation after this short break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF AMY RIGBY SONG, \"PLAYING PITTSBURGH\") DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. And we're speaking with New Yorker staff writer and chief Washington correspondent Jane Mayer. Her latest article is about the conservative activism and influence of Ginni Thomas, the wife of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. Another interesting thing you note about Frank Gaffney, this person who heads this group, the Center for Security Policy - you report in 2019 it was reported that the White House had Ginni Thomas and Frank Gaffney and some associates to brief President Trump on some policy and personnel issues. What do we know about that meeting, how it happened, what occurred? MAYER: So there's been some excellent reporting on this in The New York Times and in Axios by Jonathan Swan and Maggie Haberman at The New York Times. What we know is that for months, Ginni Thomas had been trying to get into the White House to have the meeting with President Trump. And she wanted to bring in some of her crowd with her, including Frank Gaffney. The White House was not informed that Frank Gaffney was actually a lobbying client of hers. But at any rate, she'd been pushing hard for this for quite some time. So in the end of 2018, former President Trump and his wife, Melania, had a sort of private dinner with Justice Thomas and with Justice Thomas' wife. And it was after that that the president agreed that he would allow Ginni Thomas to come into the White House and meet with him with her group. So she got access. And people I interviewed suggest that, you know, that she would never have ever been in there except for who she was married to. DAVIES: When this briefing occurred on policy and personnel issues with Ginni Thomas and Frank Gaffney, what do we know about the meeting? What happened? MAYER: Well, by all accounts, it was a very awkward and uncomfortable meeting. Ginni Thomas brought in a group of people. And they prayed there. And they handed a list - I think she handed the list of people in the Trump administration who she said needed to be purged from the administration. And she opened the meeting, actually, by looking around the room and saying she didn't trust everybody in it. So it was a really strange meeting. And apparently - I heard from somebody who was there who said that he talked to Trump about Ginni Thomas and that basically, Trump actually genuinely liked Clarence Thomas. And he also had some interests that were sort of personal interests in keeping on good terms with Clarence Thomas. He saw Clarence Thomas as a potentially really useful ally up and on the Supreme Court. And as we know, president - former President Trump had a lot of legal problems. And so he needed all the allies he could get. He also apparently entertained the thought for a while that he might be able to sort of court Clarence Thomas into retiring and then get yet another seat open, where he could appoint someone he wanted to the Supreme Court. So he had his reasons for wanting to kind of go along with and stay on good terms with Justice Thomas. But he confided to others in the White House that he regarded Justice Thomas' wife, Ginni, as what he called a wacko. DAVIES: You know, there's one case about the January 6 assault on the Capitol that's already come before the court. And that is, I guess, the release of Trump's documents. Was Justice Thomas the only vote against requiring their release? MAYER: He was the only vote that - Trump side and said that Trump didn't need to release his documents, his papers to the January 6 committee. And then, of course, it raised tons of eyebrows again because of Ginni Thomas. I mean, the thing is that Ginni Thomas has ties to many of the organizers of the January 6 protests. She had posted in favor of the protests. She has long-standing ties that go back to 2013, when she was in a kind of political group with Ali Alexander, who was one of the organizers of that event. She was on the board - the advisory board of Turning Point Action, which is another group whose founder, Charlie Kirk, had a big role in organizing the January 6 protests. And he claimed online that he would send busloads of people to the protests. And she had given an award to somebody named Kimberly Fletcher, who runs Moms for America, which also was involved in the protests. Kimberly Fletcher was an organizer of it and spoke at two of the events at January 6. And if you go back in time, one of the interesting things was - I found that Ginni Thomas spoke at an event all the way back in the Tea Party era - I think it was in 2010 - where the founder of the Oath Keepers also was speaking. And he now - Stewart Rhodes - has been indicted for seditious conspiracy in connection with the events of January 6. So there are a lot - a really weird number of connections between the - Justice Thomas' wife and these events of January 6 that are under investigation and the subject of much litigation. So when Justice Thomas was the sole justice to take Trump's side, a number of people kind of wondered, you know, is this related? DAVIES: What other cases might come before the court related to the assault on the Capitol? MAYER: Well, I mean, one of the issues that may come in front of the court is whether targets of the January 6 committee need to cooperate with it. So we've got a situation where Mark Meadows, the former chief of staff to President Trump, has refused to comply with the committee's summons that he give testimony. And that may come in front of the court. And, again, this is a problem in terms of the image of Ginni Thomas because she gave Mark Meadows one of her special awards, something she calls the Impact Award. So it seems as if she's kind of favoring him. DAVIES: We are speaking with Jane Mayer. She is a staff writer and chief Washington correspondent for The New Yorker. Her latest article in the magazine is titled \"Is Ginni Thomas A Threat To The Supreme Court?\" We'll continue our conversation after this short break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF HIOR CHRONIK'S \"WE ARE ALL SNOWFLAKES\") DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR, and we're speaking with New Yorker staff writer and chief Washington correspondent Jane Mayer. Her latest article is about the conservative activism of Ginni Thomas, the wife of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. One of the other things you noted in the piece I find interesting is that, in some cases, attorneys who have cases before the Supreme Court feel like they discover that, you know, they have an opponent, which is the other party than their attorneys', but they also have another opponent in Ginni Thomas. You mention particularly David Dinielli, deputy legal director of the Southern Poverty Law Center. What was his concern? MAYER: Yeah, it was really disturbing for him. He had a case where his organization came up in front of the court, the Supreme Court. And what he knew was that Ginni Thomas is on the executive committee. She's a director of a group called C.N.P. Action where one of the group's positions was that every week, they were told that their members needed to denounce the Southern Poverty Law Center online every single week, to come up with something to say that would denigrate this organization. And so the lawyer for the organization had a case in front of the Supreme Court, and he said, you know, how can he possibly feel that he's getting a fair shake for his organization when he knows that the justice's wife is part of a group calling for the denunciation of his group on a weekly basis? He said it just makes a complete mockery of the idea that there's fairness on the Supreme Court, and he finds it incredibly disturbing. DAVIES: So there's a lot going on here, Ginni Thomas' activism in many cases involving people who might have business before the court. How much concern is there among justices, legal scholars that this undermines the reputation of the court? MAYER: I think there's a lot of very serious concern. I spoke to a number of the people who are really considered kind of the gold standard on the subject of judicial ethics. One of them, for instance, Stephen Gillers, who's a professor of law at NYU, used very strong language. And he's always very careful. But what he said was that he thought that Ginni Thomas is - her behavior is reprehensible. He said that - he thought that if you could ask the other eight justices what they think about what she's doing, that they would tell you that they were appalled. But, again, the issue, as he put it, is, what can they do about it? DAVIES: I guess the question that obviously occurs is, how does he know what the other eight justices think? MAYER: Well, you can't know for sure. But you can see that the other justices - many of them - have handled these issues much more carefully, much more sensitively. And I think this is an important thing for people to understand. This is not a matter of picking on Justice Clarence Thomas for some reason. He's behaving, and his wife's behaving, very differently from the others. Chief Justice John Roberts - when he joined the court, his wife, Jane Sullivan Roberts, gave up her law career in order to not pose any kind of conflicts. And she stepped down from a political position she had. She was working with a nonprofit anti-abortion group that was called Feminists For Choice. She gave that up in order not to have - you know, pose these kinds of conflicts and create these problems. Ruth Bader Ginsburg, when she joined the appeals court - even before she got to the Supreme Court - her husband, Marty Ginsburg, who was one of the country's most successful tax lawyers, gave up his law practice in order to make sure that she was free to take cases and not have to recuse. And he became an academic. Right now Stephen Breyer, his brother, Charles Breyer, is a federal judge in San Francisco, and Stephen Breyer will not take any case that his brother has been involved in in order to, again, sidestep any kind of family conflicts. Even closer in some ways to the situation that the Thomases have is a situation that's on the appeals court in Washington, D.C. There's a couple where the husband is the legal director of the ACLU - that's David Cole - and his wife, Nina Pillard, is a circuit court judge on the appeals court in Washington, D.C. Nina Pillard recuses herself from any case that the ACLU has been involved in, either nationally or locally, and even in a case where the ACLU has submitted an amicus brief. You know, she's absolutely fastidious on this, and it's in complete contrast to what Clarence Thomas and his wife are doing. DAVIES: Are there efforts in Congress to change the rules that apply to the Supreme Court? MAYER: Yes, there are. And I think probably the effort is gaining in traction because of exactly this sort of thing. There's - I mean, if you step back, there's a growing feeling, according to polls in the country, that the court is too politicized. And what it's doing is undermining respect for the Supreme Court. The most recent Gallup poll showed that it had hit historic lows in terms of Americans' respect for the court. Only 40% of the country said that they respected the court. And the reason is there's a feeling that it's becoming just another - you know, the justices are just politicians in robes. So there is an effort by Congress to try to fix some of these rules, particularly having to do with ethics, with financial disclosure and with these amicus briefs. DAVIES: What does Chief Justice John Roberts think about all this? Do we know? MAYER: Well, he gave an end-of-the-year statement at the end of this last year in which he tried to fend off reformers in Congress or also there's been a - Biden has appointed a committee to kind of review the Supreme Court and see if they can submit ideas for reform. And Chief Justice Roberts basically kind of gave a defiant end-of-year statement saying back off, we can handle this ourselves. So I think he - you know, he probably doesn't want anybody interfering with the way that he runs the court. But the problem is that this is becoming more and more of a political scandal. DAVIES: Interesting. I mean, I guess it's common for people to prefer autonomy for the institutions that they head. Justice is another one. What do the legal scholars you talked to think about this position of Roberts? MAYER: Some of the people I interviewed who are legal scholars have suggested that Thomas really has to recuse. They've suggested he really needs to recuse in any case involved in the January 6 uprising because his wife has so many ties to so many of the activists who planned those uprisings and those protests. And so there's been somewhat of a call for recusal for Justice Thomas. Others just are suggesting that they think there's just a stronger and more urgent argument for the Supreme Court to adopt an ethics code itself. What the court does now is it says it self-enforces and tries to abide by the code of the other judges. But it's up to the justices to enforce it themselves. And basically, there's, I think, a growing movement, a push to try to get the court to adopt a binding code. DAVIES: Do you have any information or did any of your sources think that Justice Roberts or other justice may have reached out to Clarence Thomas about this to make it clear they're uncomfortable with Ginni Thomas' connections to groups with business before the court? MAYER: So I wondered about this, too. So I asked somebody who knows a lot about how the court works, and I was told that no way, that each justice sort of functions as their own law firm separately, independently, and that no justice would feel that it was appropriate to criticize another. And the way they get along with each other is by not making an issue of such things. DAVIES: Well, Jane Mayer, thanks so much for speaking with us again. MAYER: Well, it was so great to be with you. Thank you so much, Dave, for having me on. DAVIES: Jane Mayer is a staff writer and chief Washington correspondent for The New Yorker.

            "article_content": "Brazil's president-elect says the country is back in the environmental protection game. He made the announcement at this year's U.N. climate conference which he hopes will come to the Amazon in 2025.  AILSA CHANG, HOST: Brazil is back - that is, back in the environmental protection game. That was the message from Brazil's president-elect today at the U.N. Climate Conference in Egypt. Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva talked about his plans to protect the Amazon rainforest after years of record-breaking deforestation. And he even said that he wants to bring a future climate conference to the Amazon. But the newly-elected leftist leader faces a lot of challenges to his zero-tolerance promise. And to talk more about that, we're joined now by NPR's South America correspondent Carrie Kahn, who is in Rio de Janeiro. Hey, Carrie. CARRIE KAHN, BYLINE: Hi. CHANG: Hi. OK, so Lula da Silva just won the election - like, he hasn't even taken office yet. How come he went to the climate change conference instead of the current president of Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro? KAHN: The president, Jair Bolsonaro, is a far-right politician who questions climate change, and he has been quite hostile to multilateral approaches to it. Deforestation under his administration in the Amazon has hit record highs also. Lula was received there like a rock star today at the conference. He played right into it, too. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LUIZ INACIO LULA DA SILVA: (Speaking Portuguese). (APPLAUSE) KAHN: He said, to great applause, \"Brazil is back\" - back in being a leader in environmental protection. And he went on listing a lot of ways that Brazil will take on climate change and that preserving the Amazon will be a top priority of his new government. The majority of the Amazon rainforest sits in Brazil's territory. Lula has just won a very contentious election against Bolsonaro here. Bolsonaro was in power for the last four years and dismantled a lot of enforcement and protections in the Amazon. Illegal logging, illegal fishing, illegal farming rose to 15-year highs here, and Lula has vowed to reverse that. And he promised in this speech - and he did in this campaign - zero deforestation by 2030. CHANG: Zero deforestation - that's a really bright line. I mean, what other promises did he make today? KAHN: He talked about creating a ministry for Native people so that Indigenous people govern for themselves. He talked about sustainable agriculture and new technologies to continue providing jobs for people in the Amazon. But remember, Lula is a leftist. He's 77 years old. He came up politically through his Unionist Workers' Party, and he talks a lot about the poor and inequality. And here's a bit from when he was talking about the return of Brazil to the international stage. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LULA DA SILVA: (Speaking Portuguese). KAHN: He says, \"we're back to help build a peaceful world order to end poverty and inequality. There will be no future as long as we continue,\" he says, \"digging a bottomless pit of inequalities between rich and poor.\" While he gets a big applause at the U.N. conference for such a speech, he's had troubles back home emphasizing his support for the poor. CHANG: Yeah. How is he doing in Brazil? Like, do you think he'll be able to keep all these promises that he's making? KAHN: So last week, he talked about wanting to raise the Federal spending cap to continue cash transfers to Brazil's poorest, and the markets just slapped him hard. The real, Brazil's currency, dropped nearly 4% that day. Lula may have a very short honeymoon here when he takes office January 1. This country is divided. Bolsonaro lost by a very slim margin, and his party is now the largest in Congress. He made a lot of gains in the election, and Brazil's economy is sluggish and still struggling post-pandemic and with high inflation. CHANG: That is NPR's Carrie Kahn in Rio de Janeiro. Thank you, Carrie. KAHN: You're welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "While most countries have opposed Russia's invasion of Ukraine, many others are keeping their Russia ties intact. Their reasons range from practical matters \u2014 such as trade \u2014 to ideological.  ADRIAN FLORIDO, HOST: The situation in the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol has become increasingly dire. For days, no electricity, no gas, no relief, just constant shelling from Russian forces. Today, those forces broke a second cease-fire, according to the city's mayor. And people there and in the city of Volnovakha are still unable to evacuate. The southern city of Kherson is now occupied by the Russian military. And yesterday, a crowd let them know they are not welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTERS: (Chanting in non-English language). FLORIDO: Go home, go home, they chanted. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy urged his people to continue fighting. He also called on Russia's citizens to join the struggle for peace. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY: (Non-English language spoken). FLORIDO: Zelenskyy told the Russian people, if you keep silent now, then only your poverty will speak for you later, and only repression will answer it. Do not be silent. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ZELENSKYY: (Non-English language spoken). FLORIDO: As casualties mount, the condemnations of Russia's invasion of Ukraine have come from around the world and from most countries but not from all countries. We're going to discuss now some of the nations that are maintaining their ties with Russia, and the list of these countries goes beyond pariah states like Syria and North Korea and Eritrea. The reasons for these decisions vary, too, from the practical to the ideological. We're joined now by three NPR correspondents - Eyder Peralta in South Africa, Phil Reeves in Brazil and Lauren Frayer, who covers India but is right now in Ukraine. Hi to all three of you. EYDER PERALTA, BYLINE: Hey, Adrian. PHILIP REEVES, BYLINE: Hi. LAUREN FRAYER, BYLINE: Hi there. FLORIDO: Lauren, let's start with you. India abstained at the United Nations Security Council and the General Assembly from votes to deplore the invasion of Ukraine. What kind of relationship does India have with Russia? And what interests does it have there? FRAYER: Well, Russia is India's largest weapons supplier, and the two countries really have long cultural ties. Russia plays an important role in feeding 1.4 billion Indians. A lot of the fertilizer used in Indian agriculture comes from Russia. But two other countries factor into India's thinking here, and those are Pakistan and China. India worries that if it alienates Russia, Russia could move closer to both of those. Pakistan is India's archenemy. It also abstained from U.N. votes on Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The Pakistani prime minister, Imran Khan, was actually in Moscow, embracing Vladimir Putin when this war began last week. But meanwhile, India has a much more immediate need from Russia right now, and that's thousands of Indians who study in Ukraine. India is asking Russia to give them safe passage out, and so it's another reason why India doesn't want to antagonize Russia right now. FLORIDO: We're actually speaking with an Indian student stuck in Ukraine elsewhere in the program. What is your understanding of what's being done for these students? FRAYER: So there are about 20,000 of them. They're one of the largest groups of foreign students in Ukraine - a lot of medical students. More than 13,000 of them have gotten out, according to the Indian government. Others are still trying. One was killed in the massive bombardment of civilian areas in Ukraine. The rescue of these students has become a huge issue in India. It's election season, and so it's really become a political issue, too. FLORIDO: Eyder, turning to you. Several African countries abstained at the U.N., too, and you're in one of those countries - South Africa. What goes into their calculation about whether to sanction Russia or to keep their ties open? PERALTA: I think it tracks with what Lauren was saying - that a lot of it is realpolitik. As this invasion was beginning, one of the leaders of the military junta that is running Sudan was in Russia. At the moment in Sudan, the military is trying to put down a popular uprising, and it doesn't have good relations with the U.S. So Russia, at some point, might very well come in to save them. It's worth mentioning that Russian mercenaries have already been involved in Sudan, trying to put down another popular rebellion. And if you move further south in Uganda, another autocratic state, they also abstained. They said that they wanted to remain on the line, but the fact is that Uganda gets most of its weapons from Russia. And here in South Africa, the government has sent mixed signals. At first, the foreign minister called for Russia to leave Ukraine, but now they've walked that back, and analysts I've spoken to say that a big reason for that is business. South Africa has strong trade ties with Russia and even stronger ties with the U.S. And when you have the highest unemployment rate in the world, as South Africa does, you don't want to lose a single trade partner. FLORIDO: Phil Reeves, you're in Rio de Janeiro. Brazil has voted for the Russia resolutions at the U.N., but it also does a lot of business with Russia, doesn't it? REEVES: Brazil is one of the world's largest exporters of agricultural produce - coffee, soy, sugar and more, and the growers use a lot of fertilizer, and almost all that fertilizer comes from Russia and Belarus. And that's now stopping. Brazil is going to have to buy from elsewhere. About a week before Russia invaded Ukraine, Jair Bolsonaro, the president of Brazil, went to see Putin in Moscow, and that trip was hugely controversial. But Bolsonaro justified it claiming that he went there to secure Brazil's fertilizer supplies, a mission that obviously failed. Since then, Bolsonaro has also said his position on Putin's invasion is one of neutrality, partly because Brazil needs those sacred fertilizers, as he calls them. So Bolsonaro's - he has also talked about the need to restore peace, but his position, his neutrality has angered many nations and many people at home. There's a magazine here that's just come out with a front-page illustration showing Bolsonaro and Putin dancing a waltz next to a bunch of skulls. FLORIDO: So there is a political split there that highlights some of the ideological issues. Tell us more about that split. REEVES: Bolsonaro is at odds with the posture taken by his own government and his own foreign ministry. As you mentioned, Brazil voted in favor of that U.N. resolution deploring Russia's aggression. Now, there's a lot of politics involved. This is complicated. Bolsonaro's running for reelection this year. He's a populist, always playing to his base, much like Donald Trump, whom he greatly admires. Many of his far-right supporters don't much like the European Union. They have this idea that Europeans - the Germans and French - are maneuvering to internationalize the Amazon rainforest because of the surge of deforestation that's happened on Bolsonaro's watch. So to them, that violates Brazil's sovereignty, and they believe Putin is sympathetic to their argument on that issue. So that's another reason for sitting on the fence. But this is much broader than just right-wing politics. You know, the intervention of global powers in pursuit of their own national interests is something South American nations historically understand. So I'm hearing a much broader debate about that right across the political spectrum about the invasion. A lot of people here in Brazil are truly horrified. This country has deep ties to Europe. But you do hear some people arguing that Putin's invasion is totally inexcusable, totally unjustifiable but that history and realpolitik do offer significant context, referring, I think, in part to NATO enlargement and the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq. FLORIDO: Lauren, India was known during the Cold War for being a leader of countries that wanted to stay out of the Cold War dynamic. The country didn't want to be pushed to have to choose one side or the other. Is that part of India's thinking now? FRAYER: Yeah, it's deja vu. India didn't speak out against the Soviet invasion of Hungary back in 1956, of Czechoslovakia in 1968, Afghanistan in 1980 and even against Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014. Even though India is friendly with the West, it's not even an official U.S. treaty ally. India likes to stay neutral, and its foreign policy does not change overnight. But, you know, India is the world's biggest democracy, and what the optics are here is that the world's biggest democracy is not sticking up for democracy here in Ukraine. Prime Minister Modi called for a cessation of hostilities but did not criticize Russia. And part of it is not wanting to alienate Russia for all the reasons we've discussed. But another part of it is just this illiberal turn that India has taken in recent years. India has an increasingly authoritarian government that is accused of stifling human rights and freedom of the press. But, you know, as the Ukraine war goes on, it's unclear how long India can stay neutral on this amid moral outrage and calls for democracies around the world to stand up. For now, though, the U.S. appears to be willing to turn a blind eye to India's stance because it wants India's cooperation as a democratic bulwark to another anti-democratic foe, and that's China. FLORIDO: Finally, Eyder in Cape Town. Some African leaders have framed this invasion in terms of colonialism. How does that cut across the view of this invasion? PERALTA: You know, Kenya has explained it best. And they said that, you know, going back to fighting over borders to an imperial time means that the world is opening the doors to a whole new Cold War, and no one wants that, certainly not the countries in the Global South, which have paid a heavy price in these proxy wars between world powers. But at the same time, the rhetoric around here feels like we're back in the Cold War. Here in South Africa, there's talk about the historical debt that this country owes the Soviet Union, which helped significantly in the struggle against white minority rule. And then there is blatant Cold War positioning. In Uganda, the president's son has said that he stands 100% with Russia, and he's been tweeting pictures of Fidel Castro, who he calls a hero. The African continent just went through a period where democracy was advancing, but now we seem to be headed toward a more authoritarian period. And those leaders are more willing to align with Russia. But another argument that I have heard here is that the West has stood by as democratic movements are crushed violently on the African continent. They've stood by as wars have raged here. So what is it, they ask, that makes this conflict so much more important to the world? FLORIDO: That's NPR's Eyder Peralta, Lauren Frayer and Phil Reeves. Thanks to all three of you. REEVES: You're welcome. FRAYER: Thank you. PERALTA: Thank you, Adrian. Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "LGBTQ advocacy groups are calling the midterms a \"rainbow wave,\" citing a record number of LGBTQ candidate victories. Among them is the country's first lesbian governor, Maura Healey of Massachusetts.  ELISSA NADWORNY, HOST: The midterm elections have propelled a record number of LGBTQ candidates to office. As NPR's Melissa Block reports, advocacy groups are hailing the results as a rainbow wave. MELISSA BLOCK, BYLINE: According to the nonpartisan LGBTQ Victory Fund, this was the first year with openly LGBTQ candidates on the ballot in every single state. And the group says more than 350 have won, from congressional and governors' races all the way down to school boards and city councils. Among the notable firsts emerging from the midterms, Democrat Maura Healey of Massachusetts, the state's current attorney general, will become the country's first openly lesbian governor. She offered this message in her victory speech. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MAURA HEALEY: Tonight, I want to say something to every little girl and every young LGBTQ person out there. (CHEERING) HEALEY: I hope - I hope tonight shows you that you can be whatever, whoever you want to be. (CHEERING) BLOCK: Another game changer... (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BECCA BALINT: Thank you, Vermonters. (CHEERING) BLOCK: Vermont will be sending its first openly gay person to Congress. That's Democratic state Senator Becca Balint. She'll also be the first woman to represent Vermont on Capitol Hill. As a gay woman, Balint campaigned with what she called empathy for people on the margins. She spoke to supporters last night in Burlington. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BALINT: Vermont is a place where the daughter of an immigrant dad and a working-class mom can be the first woman and the first gay person to represent Vermont in the U.S. House of Representatives. (CHEERING) BLOCK: In state houses, two transgender women - Leigh Finke and Zooey Zephyr - will be the first trans lawmakers in the Minnesota and Montana legislatures, respectively. And in New Hampshire, 26-year-old James Roesener becomes the first trans man elected to any state legislature in U.S. history. SEAN MELOY: That is a huge win. BLOCK: Sean Meloy is vice president of political programs with LGBTQ Victory Fund. MELOY: Only six trans men serve in any office in the United States of America. And breaking that barrier I think is going to be important to showcase to trans men and trans and non-binary people that they need to keep stepping forward to run, and they can win. BLOCK: These victories run counter to a wave of anti-LGBTQ legislation that's been passed in state legislatures. Meloy says the election results show that those measures have backfired. MELOY: We saw a record amount of anti-LGBTQ piece of legislation and a ton of anti-LGBTQ attacks trying to be used as a wedge issue in so many races across the country. I think that voters largely saw that that rhetoric was being used to demonize our community for votes and largely ignored it. BLOCK: The LGBTQ winners are overwhelmingly Democrats. One Republican victory comes from Long Island, N.Y., where, for the first time in history, two openly gay candidates faced off in a congressional general election. Republican George Santos was the victor there. Melissa Block, NPR News. Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "What more aid for Ukraine says about bipartisanship in Washington; Trump's primary endorsements; and how Democrats' hopes rest on the working class appeal of their Penn. Senate candidate.  AYESHA RASCOE, HOST: While in Seoul yesterday, President Biden signed a bill granting Ukraine an additional $40 billion in assistance. And if you're thinking it's unusual for a president to sign a bill into law while overseas, you're correct. Joining me now is NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson. Good morning, Mara. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Hi, Ayesha. RASCOE: So this bill was finalized on Thursday, but Biden was not able to sign it before leaving for Asia. So according to a White House official, it was sent on a commercial flight - like, that's how urgent the administration viewed this aid to Ukraine. And it was passed the Senate - it passed the Senate with an 86-11 vote. So what does that tell us, Mara? LIASSON: I think it tells us that even with increased polarization, there are a few things that both parties in Congress can agree on, and supporting Ukraine's ability to defend itself against Russian - Russia is one of them. And, you know, Donald Trump came out against this bill. He - but still, a majority of Republican senators voted for it. And I think it means that one of the biggest legacies of President Donald Trump, this autocrat-friendly approach to foreign policy - the big bear hug for Hungary's Viktor Orban, the embrace of Vladimir Putin - isn't sticking, at least among Republicans in Congress. And, you know, Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader, tried to make that point. He traveled to Ukraine recently with a delegation of Republican senators to show support for President Zelenskyy. RASCOE: And so, I mean, some Republican primary voters were getting a taste of what they think is important. What can you tell us so far about the strength of Trump's endorsement with them? LIASSON: So far, the candidates that Trump has backed have won more than they've lost, but it's not an overwhelming number of wins. In Ohio, his endorsement of J.D. Vance seems to have taken him from the back of the pack to win that primary. But his pick in the Republican primary for governor in Idaho lost by 20 points. And his pick in the Republican primary for Georgia governor is flailing. That primary is Tuesday. In Alabama, which also holds a primary on Tuesday, Donald Trump actually unendorsed Mo Brooks, who has actually surged in the polls since then. So that's a mixed result. And some of the candidates that Trump picked to endorse, he picked very late in the race when they were already way ahead, like Doug Mastriano in Pennsylvania. Mastriano is an election denier. He attended the January 6 Stop the Steal rally. And he's the kind of Trump candidate that's emerging victorious in some of these primaries and is making Republican Party officials nervous because they're not sure that extreme candidates like that can beat Democrats in November, especially in swing states like Pennsylvania. RASCOE: So speaking of Pennsylvania, the Republican Senate primary race there has yet to be resolved. What's happening there? LIASSON: What's happening there is it looks like it's heading for a recount. The Trump-backed candidate, celebrity TV doctor Mehmet Oz, and former hedge fund CEO David McCormick are separated by less than 0.5% of the vote, which is the trigger for an automatic recount in Pennsylvania. Remember, Trump campaigned against McCormick. He disparaged him as a liberal Wall Street Republican, a money manager for China, not MAGA enough. And Trump has suggested to Oz that he should just declare victory, say stop the count, say anything else would be an attempt to steal the election. But so far, Dr. Oz has not done this. Instead, his campaign indicates that they're confident he can win this primary fair and square. RASCOE: Well, that sounds like a familiar strategy... LIASSON: Yes, very familiar. RASCOE: ...That Trump is pushing. So whoever wins will face off with Lieutenant Governor John Fetterman, who's now a stroke survivor. In the minute we have left, you know, what can you tell us about him? LIASSON: Yes, he is a stroke survivor. Fetterman voted for himself using an emergency ballot from the hospital. That didn't hurt him in the Democratic primary. He won in a landslide. It looks like he's going to win every single county. His opponent was Congressman Conor Lamb, who's a moderate former Marine, the kind of Democrat that history tells us has the best chance of winning in Pennsylvania. But Democratic primary voters rejected that model. And Democratic operatives I've talked to say they think Fetterman is the kind of modern candidate who can win because he has a very strong personal brand. He's very recognizable. He's 6-foot-9. He's got a shaved head and a goatee and tattoos, and he wears hoodies and shorts to public events. And he has a huge following on social media. And he's won statewide before. So Democrats think he might have a better chance to solve one of their most difficult problems, which is the collapse of support for Democrats among white working-class voters. And Fetterman is progressive on some issues - \"Medicare for All,\" legalizing marijuana - but he's not for a ban on fracking, which is a big business in Pennsylvania. And on that one, he's right where the majority of Pennsylvania voters on - are. So Democrats are hoping that in a year that's difficult for them, they could hang on in Pennsylvania. RASCOE: That's NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson. Thanks, Mara. LIASSON: Thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Gov. John Fetterman has won the Democratic nomination for U.S. Senate. John Fetterman, Pennsylvania's lieutenant governor, easily won the state's Democratic primary for U.S. Senate on Tuesday, according to a race call by The Associated Press, but the Republican race appeared headed for a recount. The 6-foot-9 Fetterman, who often wears shorts to campaign events and has the persona of an authentic anti-politician, topped Rep. Conor Lamb in the primary. Fetterman's win was expected despite the fact that he suffered a stroke last weekend and was not able to attend the last swing of campaign events. On Tuesday his campaign announced he was about to undergo a procedure to implant a pacemaker. Fetterman has said he'll be fine. Lamb, a more moderate candidate, failed to make any significant traction against Fetterman, a former small-town mayor who backed Bernie Sanders' 2020 presidential run, even though Lamb was seen as a rising Democratic star in the Trump era. State Sen. Malcolm Kenyatta, who was looking to become the first ever LGBTQ candidate elected to statewide office in Pennsylvania, trailed even further behind. Fetterman now faces the winner of the Republican primary, which was a two-candidate race early Wednesday with celebrity doctor Mehmet Oz holding a two-tenths of a percentage point lead over former hedge fund CEO David McCormick. Pennsylvania law calls for an automatic recount if the margin is half a percentage point or less. Conservative commentator Kathy Barnette, who had surged into contention in recent polls, trailed Oz and McCormick. Oz has the endorsement of former President Donald Trump. The Republican winner and Fetterman will face off in November for the first open Senate seat in Pennsylvania in a dozen years. Current Republican Sen. Pat Toomey will resign at the end of his term. The general election will have high stakes for both parties. The Senate is split 50-50, but Democrats are able to break ties with Vice President Harris' vote. In a statement, President Biden said Democrats are united behind Fetterman. Biden said Fetterman \"understands that working class families in Pennsylvania and across the country have been dealt out for far too long. It's time to deal them back in, and electing John to the United States Senate would be a big step forward for Pennsylvania's working people.\"",

LONDON \u2014 Britain's governing Conservatives suffered losses in their few London strongholds in local elections, according to results announced Friday that will pile more pressure on Prime Minister Boris Johnson amid ethics scandals and a worsening economic picture. The vote for more than 200 local councils decides who collects garbage and fills potholes across the country, and is also seen as an important barometer of public opinion ahead of the next national election, which must be held by 2024. The main opposition Labour Party, which has been out of power nationally since 2010, won control of Wandsworth, Barnet and Westminster, three London boroughs long held by the Conservatives. With results from about half of England announced Friday morning, Labour had not made big gains outside of the capital, especially in working-class northern England \u2014 areas that Johnson successfully wooed in the 2019 general election. Conservative Party chairman Oliver Dowden acknowledged the results in London were \"difficult\" but said the \"more mixed picture\" elsewhere showed Labour did not have the momentum to win the next general election. Labour's national campaign coordinator, Shabana Mahmood, argued that the results showed Labour was building a solid foundation to get back to power. \"Labour is making headway ... taking over key Conservative councils and winning in vital Parliamentary battlegrounds across the country,\" she said. Results are still to come from the rest of England, and all of Scotland and Wales. In Northern Ireland, voters are electing a new 90-seat Assembly, with polls suggesting the Irish nationalist party Sinn Fein could win the largest number of seats, and the post of first minister, in what would be a historic first. The election campaign was dominated by increasing prices for food and fuel, which have sent household bills soaring. Opposition parties are demanding the government do more to ease the cost-of-living crunch \u2014 driven by the war in Ukraine, COVID-19 pandemic disruption and economic aftershocks from Britain's exit from the European Union. Both left-of-center Labour and the centrist Liberal Democrats advocate a windfall tax on energy companies, which have reported record profits amid rocketing oil and gas prices. Johnson's Conservative government argues taxing big firms like Shell and BP would deter much-needed investment in renewable energy that's key to meeting Britain's climate commitments. The election also comes after months of turmoil for Johnson, in which he became the first prime minister to be sanctioned for breaking the law in office. He was fined 50 pounds ($62) by police for attending his own surprise birthday party in June 2020 when lockdown rules barred social gatherings. Johnson has apologized, but denies knowingly breaking the rules. He faces the possibility of more fines over other parties \u2014 police are investigating a dozen gatherings \u2014and a parliamentary investigation into whether he misled lawmakers about his behavior. The prime minister also faces discontent within his own party. A bad result could lead Conservatives to try to replace Johnson with a less tarnished leader. Dowden, the party chairman, acknowledged there had been \"challenging headlines for the past few months.\" \"But I do think that set against all of that, those sort of challenges that you would expect after 12 years in office, these are challenging results, but we have made progress in lots of places,\" he told Sky News. \"Labour are certainly not on the path to power and I believe that Boris Johnson does have the leadership skills, in particular the energy and the dynamism that we need during this difficult period of time.\"",

The Democratic National Convention approved a resolution Wednesday that revamps its presidential nominating process, which means Iowa could lose its \"first in the nation\" status. It's official: Iowa and New Hampshire's first-in-the-nation status as the caucus and primary openers of the presidential campaign season is no longer guaranteed after the Democratic National Committee approved a resolution that significantly changes the way the party picks its presidential candidates. \"I personally believe, and I think I'm not speaking just for myself, that this is a powerful resolution of a thoughtful process that is going to be inclusive of all Democrats,\" said Jim Roosevelt Jr., who co-chairs the Rules and Bylaws Committee, after the measure passed Wednesday night. \"That's our goal.\" The resolution upends the traditional presidential nominating calendar for Democrats, which places the Iowa caucuses first, followed by primaries in New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina. Iowa and New Hampshire have been the first and second contests since 1972. The newly adopted resolution will require states or territories to make the case for themselves to be included in a batch of states to have contests ahead of Super Tuesday in early March. Committee members say the change will ensure a nominating process that is more reflective of the party's values. The measure lays out a roadmap for states that wish to go towards the beginning of the calendar, taking into account the demographic diversity of the state, its use of primaries over caucuses, and how competitive it will be in the general election. \"Does the state contribute to the party's ability to win in the general election?\" Roosevelt said. \"It might well be that you could pick a state where somebody will be overwhelmingly popular, but they're an outlier from the rest of the country. You pick somebody who's really good with sled dogs for an Alaska early primary...that's not going to create a candidate that necessarily resonates nationally.\" He added that electoral history is also an integral factor. \"Has the state chosen candidates in the past in either the primaries or caucuses who went on to win both the nomination and election?\" States that are interested must submit a formal application in early June and give a presentation to the committee later that month. The committee will announce its proposed schedule in July and then the full DNC will vote to approve it in August. Discussion among the committee members ahead of Wednesday's vote made it clear there is a strong preference against approving a caucus state in the early window. \"I will say it right now, caucus states are going to be a hard sell for me,\" said committee member Mo Elleithee of Washington, D.C. But Elleithee didn't want to go as far as saying caucus states \"need not apply.\" \"I think we want to give every state the chance to make the most compelling case and then we as committee members will know which of these factors are most important to us,\" he said. \"States that don't offer some form of diversity are going to be a hard sell for me. But there may be states that can convince me, that I'm willing to overlook some of that because the rest of their case is so compelling as to how they fit into the framework.\" Scott Brennan, a member from Iowa, added he preferred to keep the language flexible. \"Let's be general and let's let everyone make their case and we'll let the chips fall where they may,\" he said. In 2020, neither of the first two states' winners went on to win the Democratic presidential nomination. And many have argued that neither state, both of which are largely white, is diverse enough to lead the nominating process. Ross Wilburn, the chair of Iowa's Democratic Party, pushed back against this in an interview with NPR, arguing Democrats must show they can address the needs of a diversifying rural America. \"Nationally, if Democrats can't figure out how to talk to Iowans, then we're in big trouble as a party,\" he said. \"It's no secret that the national Democratic Party has been losing seats across the country because of its weakened appeal to rural working class Americans. Small rural states like Iowa must have a voice in our presidential nominating process.\" Wilburn said he plans to make the case for why Iowa's caucuses remain first when the DNC finalizes its process. He also pointed to the fact that his state has given flight to upstart politicians, like the winner of Iowa's 2008 caucuses. \"Again, don't forget there would not be a President Obama without Iowa. There simply wouldn't,\" he said. Chaos reigned in Des Moines, Iowa, on Feb. 3, 2020, as reporters pressed various campaign and election officials for why the caucus results were so delayed.\n                \n                    \n                    Alex Wong/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Chaos reigned in Des Moines, Iowa, on Feb. 3, 2020, as reporters pressed various campaign and election officials for why the caucus results were so delayed. \"Iowa showed the disaster of a caucus in the last election,\" said Michigan Democratic Rep. Debbie Dingell, referencing various logistical and technological challenges in 2020 that made it difficult for Iowa to name the winner of its caucuses. Dingell is already pushing for her state to get early status. Dingell's involvement was first reported by The Washington Post. She said Michigan's status as a closely divided purple state is one of the reasons it is well positioned to be part of the early window. President Biden won Michigan by a narrow margin in 2020. In 2016, former President Donald Trump did so by an even slimmer margin. \"It's a state that reflects the great diversity of our country. We have urban areas, we have rural areas. We have manufacturing, we have farming. We have rich, different cultures, all types of backgrounds,\" Dingell told NPR prior to the committee's vote on Wednesday. Similar efforts are already underway in states like New Jersey, where state party Chair LeRoy Jones has been pushing the Democratic Party to consider his state, which normally votes in June. \"We have to use the past as a barometer on how effectively we can move forward. We saw some interesting things occur in the Iowa caucuses that kind of left folks with a little eyebrows raised,\" Jones told NPR. \"And the whole notion of the caucuses may have had its day, at least in the beginning part of the presidential primary. We think that New Jersey offers an enhanced benefit to voter engagement.\" Jones said that New Jersey's diversity, as well as its relatively compact size, make it a good fit. \"You have a collaboration of population, of diversity, of tourism, of transportation ease. I think that has particular value added to the process.\" Democrats in Iowa and New Hampshire have argued that their size allows presidential candidates to have a chance to break through before moving on to larger states in major media markets where campaigning is more expensive. Rules and Bylaws Committee member David McDonald of Washington state raised that issue at the committee's last virtual meeting. \"I hope that we will continue to have the upfront window be as accessible as possible to candidates and not slide into a situation where essentially we end up with four large states up front in an election decided based on mass media markets,\" he said. Asked about arguments that the process should be led by small states, Dingell of Michigan pushed back. \"Why should two disparate small states that don't reflect the diversity of this country be the ones that presidential candidates go into their homes?\" Dingell said. \"I think presidential candidates should have to home into a state like ours and do retail politics, not hide behind an ad on TV.\"",

John Fetterman was at a brewpub in Pennsylvania's Trump Country that was serving coffee to about 60 local Democrats who showed up on a Saturday morning. The Democrats were thrilled the lieutenant governor and U.S. Senate candidate was in the rural area. Speaking to him, one local jokingly called it \"enemy territory.\" \"No, not enemy territory,\" Fetterman replied, \"just friends we haven't met yet.\" Fetterman, a former small-town mayor from western Pennsylvania, is the early front-runner in a competitive Democratic primary that includes Rep. Conor Lamb and state Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta.

The brewpub stop was in Clarion, Pa., about an hour and a half northeast of Pittsburgh. Former President Donald Trump lost Pennsylvania in the 2020 election but carried the rural parts of the state by wide margins. Later in the day, more than 100 people showed up for a Fetterman event at a fire hall in Smethport in the northern part of the state. The drive there rolled past countless signs and banners reading \"Trump-Pence,\" \"Trump 2024\" and \"Impeach Biden.\" \"And some folks would say, 'Why would you waste your time?' And I'm like, 'because you have rooms like this, and you have people that have the same core values and same issues as you do,' \" Fetterman told NPR in an interview. \"And if you don't show up and you don't engage, then who else are they going to listen to?\" Fetterman's image is that of the anti-politician. He's 6-foot-8, with tattoos, a shaved head and a chin beard, and he listens to heavy metal in his truck. Despite the cold, his campaign wardrobe on the Saturday was shorts and an oversized Carhartt sweatshirt. His stump speech is also informal and short and hits topics important to working-class voters: broadband, a living wage, access to health care. \"We need to continually make more and more stuff in our country,\" he said. \"I just fundamentally believe that.\" He has also made legalizing marijuana a key part of his platform. Fetterman, who was elected to his statewide post in 2018, describes himself as a progressive but says things he supported years ago, like a $15 minimum wage, are now the mainstream of the Democratic Party. Another thing Fetterman promises is that he'll be tough on Republicans and that he can play hardball as well as they can. \"When it comes to achieving a goal that they want, [Republicans] are united and ruthless,\" he said. \"When it came to blocking Merrick Garland's appointment to the Supreme Court, they were united and ruthless. When it comes to driving out the impurity in the party in terms of, like, the Liz Cheneys and the Adam Kinzingers, they are ruthless and united because they do not tolerate dissent. And why can't Democrats embrace that philosophy but for working families?\" Rep. Conor Lamb, D-Pa., talks with constituents at Riardo's Bar and Grill in New Castle, Pa., last summer.\n                \n                    \n                    Jeff Swensen/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Rep. Conor Lamb, D-Pa., talks with constituents at Riardo's Bar and Grill in New Castle, Pa., last summer. Fetterman has raised the most money so far. But Congressman Lamb is another contender, a moderate Democrat who represents a western Pennsylvania district where he has shown he can win in a place that's closely divided between Democrats and Republicans. In appearance and style, Lamb and Fetterman are opposites. Lamb's Facebook profile describes him as \"Marine, prosecutor, patriot, Catholic, Democrat.\" But call Lamb the centrist candidate in the race and he replies like this: \"I'm not really big on the term centrist because when I hear centrist, what I think of is someone who just looks at where the two extremes are and jumps in the halfway point regardless of what they actually believe,\" Lamb said. \"You know, I have things I really believe in, and I've been campaigning on them and voting for them for four years.\" In an NPR interview, Lamb stressed how he differs from centrist Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia; for example, the congressman supports getting rid of the legislative filibuster. He describes himself as a strong supporter of President Biden's agenda, especially the infrastructure plan that passed with bipartisan support and the Build Back Better proposal, which has not passed and includes funding for home health care and for the transition to jobs in clean energy industries. And ultimately, Lamb says, his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and his record make him the one who can beat a Republican in the fall in Pennsylvania. \"I think the overriding issue in the primary is simply who can stand a chance to win the general election,\" he said. \"And my experience is that I've beaten Republicans three times in a row in tough districts and under a big spotlight, and so, you know, I've been making the case that that qualifies me to be the one to carry our banner this year. And I also think my work in Congress and especially my votes in Congress on many of the most important issues give people a little bit of certainty about how I would perform as a senator.\" Pennsylvania state Rep.

Malcolm Kenyatta meets with Chester County officials and supporters at a U.S. Senate campaign event in West Chester, Pa., on Feb. 18. The third leading Democrat is Kenyatta, who represents North Philadelphia in the Pennsylvania House. He, too, has his eye on working-class voters. He says that's the community he grew up in. \"Being a working person is not about dressing a certain way,\" he told NPR. \"It's about your life experiences and what it means to have to look your kids in the eyes, as my parents had to look me in the eyes, and say, 'Baby, I don't know what we're going to do this week.' For us, we understand that our story is grounded in a reality that so many other people share.\" Kenyatta says that he'll campaign all across the state and that he'll rally Democrats wherever they are, but he also stresses that he's the one who can drive turnout in the state's urban areas, especially with the Black vote. \"It is going to be critical that we have massive, massive turnout in southeastern Pennsylvania,\" he said. He's also running in hopes of seeing two barriers crumble. He wants to be Pennsylvania's first Black U.S. senator. Kenyatta would also be the first statewide officeholder who's a member of the LGBTQ community. \"Because I inhabit so many different communities,\" he said, \"we're going to be well-positioned to bring people together. And ... when you know what it's like to be treated differently because of who you are, you think about that in policy.\" The Republican side of the Senate race is just as unsettled as the Democrats', especially after Trump's pick dropped out and celebrity Dr. Mehmet Oz jumped in. The Pennsylvania primaries are in May. The Fetterman events mostly drew supporters of him or people leaning that way. But many said they don't yet know which Democrat they'll vote for. There was at least one Republican present, too. Francis Auriemmo voted for Trump but says he's open to supporting Fetterman in the general election. \"Just his thoughts on revitalization, that shows promise,\" Auriemmo said. \"Now it's my understanding, when he was mayor, he did do a lot. And if he had that much energy for his own town, he just might have that much energy for the state.\" But Republicans can't vote in a Democratic primary, and Pennsylvania Democrats aren't banking on many votes from the other side in the general election. There was also a sense of anxiety among Democrats at the start of a midterm election year when historic trends show that the party that holds the White House takes a beating. Take Marty Wilder, chair of the McKean County Democrats. \"I'm terrified, in all honesty,\" she said. \"I can just see what's going on. I don't know what's going to happen. And being in the middle of Trump Country up here, it's a little bit scary. I'm honest. I don't know where the country's going.\" This story was produced by Samantha Balaban and Gabriel Dunatov and edited by Ed McNulty for radio.",

            "article_content": "In Pennsylvania, three Democratic contenders for the U.S. Senate are campaigning in very different ways.  DON GONYEA, HOST: Now a trip to Pennsylvania, which is home to one of this year's most closely watched U.S. Senate contests. Two-term Republican Pat Toomey is retiring. The top Republicans in the race to replace him are a TV personality, Dr. Mehmet Oz, better known as Dr. Oz, and a former hedge fund manager, David McCormick. But it's also considered a prime pickup opportunity for Democrats, whose top contenders we'll be looking at right now - three very different personalities all taking very different approaches to campaigning. We're in a parking lot in Clarion, Penn., about an hour and a half northeast of Pittsburgh. The Pennsylvania primary is just about three months away. That means campaigning is really starting to pick up. That's why we're here, to see the lieutenant governor who's running for U.S. Senate, Democrat John Fetterman. JOHN FETTERMAN: How are you? UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Good. I tried to make a bet on if you'd wear shorts or not. GONYEA: The building is a brewpub open early and serving coffee to about 60 local Democrats who have shown up. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Thanks for coming out to see us. I appreciate how you really - I see you on TV, how you fight, you know, take the... GONYEA: The candidate has five stops on this day, all in Trump country. The former president lost the state in 2020 but still carried rural PA by wide margins. Local Democrats are thrilled Fetterman has shown up here. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: Coming into enemy territory. It's good. FETTERMAN: No, not enemy territory, just friends we haven't met yet. GONYEA: Fetterman's working the room, taking selfies. It's cold outside, but his campaign wardrobe today - shorts and an oversized Carhartt sweatshirt. Fetterman's image is that of the anti-politician. He has tattoos, shaved head, chin beard, listens to heavy metal in his truck. His stump speech is short and informal and hits topics important to working-class voters. FETTERMAN: How's your broadband up here? UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: Awful. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #5: Terrible. FETTERMAN: It is awful. And If you believe that 7.25 as a minimum wage is plenty, I'm probably not your candidate. Have you found health care useful in your life? I have. We need to continually make more and more stuff in our country. I just fundamentally believe that. (APPLAUSE) GONYEA: Fetterman is from western Pennsylvania, far from the state's major population center in and around Philadelphia to the east. He's been a small-town mayor. He was elected lieutenant governor in 2018. Early afternoon, it was another event in another small community, Smethport. More than 100 people showed up at a local fire hall. (APPLAUSE) GONYEA: In an interview, I asked Fetterman about the drive over - 90 minutes on back roads, rolling past countless signs and banners reading Trump-Pence, Trump 2024, impeach Biden, plus those with a four-letter word next to Biden's name. FETTERMAN: And some folks would say, why would you waste your time? And I'm like, because you have rooms like this, and you have people that have the same core values and same issues as you do. And if you don't show up and you don't engage, then who else are they going to listen to? GONYEA: He says there are Democrats out here. You meet them. And maybe some others will give a listen as well. Fetterman describes himself as a progressive, but he likes to say things he supported years ago, like the $15 minimum wage, are now the mainstream of the Democratic Party. Another thing Fetterman promises - that he'll be tough on Republicans and that he can play hardball as well as they can. Today, you were talking about the Republican Party and describing them as united and ruthless. FETTERMAN: Yeah. When it comes to achieving a goal that they want, they are united and ruthless. When it came to blocking Merrick Garland's appointment to the Supreme Court, they were united and ruthless. When it comes to driving out the impurity in the party in terms of, like, the Liz Cheneys and the Adam Kinzingers, they are ruthless and united because they do not tolerate dissent. And why can't Democrats embrace that philosophy but for working families? GONYEA: Fetterman is the early front-runner, and he's raised the most money so far. But another leading contender is U.S. Congressman Conor Lamb, a moderate Democrat who represents a western Pennsylvania district where he has shown he can win in a place that's closely divided between Democrats and Republicans. In appearance and style, Lamb and Fetterman are opposites. Look no further than Lamb's Facebook profile, which says, quote, \"marine, prosecutor, patriot, Catholic, Democrat.\" But call Lamb the centrist candidate in the race, and you get a reply like this. CONOR LAMB: Yeah, well, I'm not really big on the term centrist because when I hear centrist, what I think of is someone who just looks at where the two extremes are and jumps in the halfway point regardless of what they actually believe. You know, I have things I really believe in, and I've been campaigning on them and voting for them for four years. GONYEA: This is from an event two days ago in the former steel town of Bethlehem. The speaker is Mayor Willie Reynolds. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) WILLIAM REYNOLDS: OK. It is absolutely wonderful to be here to announce my support and my endorsement for... GONYEA: Congressman Lamb describes himself as a strong supporter of President Biden's agenda, especially the infrastructure plan that was passed with bipartisan support and the so-called Build Back Better proposals which have not passed. They are designed to address what's known as human infrastructure, things that include funding for home health care and for the transition to jobs in energy-efficient industries. And ultimately, Lamb says, his resume and his record make him the one that can beat a Republican in the fall in Pennsylvania. LAMB: I think the overriding issue in the primary is simply who can stand a chance to win the general election. And my experience is that I've beaten Republicans three times in a row in tough districts and under a big spotlight, and so, you know, I've been making the case that that qualifies me to be the one to carry our banner this year. And I also think my work in Congress and especially my votes in Congress on many of the most important issues give people a little bit of certainty about how I would perform as a senator. GONYEA: The third leading Democrat running for the U.S. Senate seat is State Representative Malcolm Kenyatta. He represents North Philadelphia in the state House. He too has his eye on working-class voters. He says that's the community he grew up in. MALCOLM KENYATTA: Being a working person is not about dressing a certain way. It's about your life experiences and what it means to have to look your kids in the eyes, as my parents had to look me in the eyes, and say, baby, I don't know what we're going to do this week. For us, we understand that our story is grounded in a reality that so many other people share. GONYEA: Kenyatta says he'll campaign all across the state and that he'll rally Democrats wherever they are, but he also stresses that he's the one who can drive turnout in the state's urban areas, especially with the Black vote. KENYATTA: It is going to be critical that we have massive, massive turnout in southeastern Pennsylvania. If folks want to win this race, then you know what? We're going to have to have a lot of people turnout in southeastern Pennsylvania as well as everywhere across the state. GONYEA: He's also running in hopes of seeing two barriers crumble. He wants to be Pennsylvania's first Black U.S. senator. Kenyatta would also be the first statewide officeholder who's a member of the LGBTQ community. KENYATTA: Because I inhabit so many different communities, we're going to be well-positioned to bring people together. And I'll just end with this note. When you know what it's like to be treated differently because of who you are, you think about that in policy. GONYEA: Back at the fire hall in Smethport after that John Fetterman event, most of those we talked to were either Fetterman supporters or leaning that way. But many also said they don't yet know which Democrat they'll support. Then there was the Republican we spoke with. His name is Francis Auriemmo. He voted for Trump but said he's open to possibly supporting Fetterman in the general election. FRANCIS AURIEMMO: You know, just his thoughts on revitalization - that shows promise. Now, it's my understanding, when he was mayor, he did do a lot. And if he had that much energy for his own town, he just might have that much energy for the state. GONYEA: But this is a Democratic primary, and Republicans can't vote in it. And many Pennsylvania Democrats aren't banking on many votes from the other side in the general election. And at these events, you do sense the anxiety that they feel at the start of a midterm election year when historic trends show that the party that holds the White House takes a beating. Take Marty Wilder. She's the chairperson of the McKean County Democrats. MARTY WILDER: I'm terrified, in all honesty. I can just see what's going on. I don't know what's going to happen. And being in the middle of Trump country up here, it's a little bit scary. I'm honest. I don't know where the country's going. GONYEA: In a few months, Pennsylvania will have a Democratic Senate nominee. It's that person's notion of where the votes are that will ultimately shape the fall campaign. So that's one slice of the story from Pennsylvania. We'll be watching it and covering it all year, tracking candidates from both major parties and watching the voters watch them.

Sonny Subia is one of those people who seems to know most people around town and is trying to meet all the rest. At a restaurant in Greeley, Colo., last month, he was chatting with a stranger at the bar who was celebrating his 21st birthday. The restaurant owner is a friend, who Subia noted is \"as right-wing as you can get.\" \"I have friends all the way on the right and all the way on the left. And you just have to around northern Colorado,\" Subia said. Subia is a school expulsion officer, and in his spare time, he's the volunteer Colorado state director for LULAC, the League of United Latin American Citizens. He's also a committed Democrat. And he's worried. \"This congressional district is the largest Latino population of any district in the state \u2014 and it's a toss-up,\" he said, exasperated. \"How is that? It just doesn't make sense.\" Sonny Subia is a school expulsion officer. In his spare time, he's the volunteer Colorado state director for LULAC, the League of United Latin American Citizens.\n                \n                    \n                    AAron Ontiveroz for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Sonny Subia is a school expulsion officer. In his spare time, he's the volunteer Colorado state director for LULAC, the League of United Latin American Citizens. That district is Colorado's 8th, which stretches from Denver's northern suburbs up to the more-conservative area around Greeley, a 45-minute drive away. It is a new district in the wake of the 2020 census, and it's the most heavily Latino in the state at nearly 40%. Expected to be one of the country's closest congressional races in November, it's also an area that reflects key national trends that could shape the midterm elections. Subia is reflecting anxiety that is felt throughout the Democratic Party over its standing with Latino voters after Republican gains in 2020. A development takes shape in January in Thornton, Colo., with the Rocky Mountains in the distance.\n                \n                    \n                    AAron Ontiveroz for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption A development takes shape in January in Thornton, Colo., with the Rocky Mountains in the distance. \"This 8th seems like such a different race, but it actually represents where all the growth has really been in every city around America, where you have this booming Latino population outside of Charlotte, Philly, Atlanta, and you can just go on down the line,\" said Chuck Rocha, a Democratic strategist who is working with 8th District candidate Chaz Tedesco. Loading... On the whole, the Latino voting-age population in the U.S. is more Democratic, younger, less likely to be registered to vote and faster-growing than the U.S. population as a whole. But what it means to be a Latino voter is particular to any given place. Because living in Colorado's 8th means living in a fast-growing area, housing is a big issue. State Rep. Yadira Caraveo, who has served as a Colorado state representative since 2018, is running for Congress in Colorado's 8th Congressional District.\n                \n                    \n                    AAron Ontiveroz for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption State Rep. Yadira Caraveo, who has served as a Colorado state representative since 2018, is running for Congress in Colorado's 8th Congressional District. \"It's getting increasingly more expensive, and it's changed a lot in the last 20 years,\" said Yadira Caraveo, a pediatrician and Democratic candidate. \"And so, you know, parents talk to me all the time about how many jobs they're working to be able to afford to live here, how much their rent costs.\" That topic of affordability also came up with voters. At a meeting of local businesspeople, financial planner Emilio Valdez said the cost of living in the area has accelerated. \"You take a look at my daughter, for instance. Her and her husband just bought a house and they paid a half a million for it,\" he said. \"And when that house sold eight years ago, it was $230,000. So, you know, a big difference in what the housing prices are doing.\" Emilio Valdez (center) speaks with congressional candidate Erik Aadland at Rails End Beer Co. on Jan. 28. Valdez, a Republican voter, said he likes to know what candidates stand for before signing petitions in support of them.\n                \n                    \n                    AAron Ontiveroz for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Emilio Valdez (center) speaks with congressional candidate Erik Aadland at Rails End Beer Co. on Jan. 28. Valdez, a Republican voter, said he likes to know what candidates stand for before signing petitions in support of them. Valdez is a Republican, and he came out to see Jan Kulmann, a GOP candidate and the mayor of Thornton, one of the Denver suburbs contained in the 8th District. Sitting at a coffeehouse in the development of Reunion, Kulmann noted how quickly the suburban development had expanded. \"None of this was here just a few years ago,\" she said, gesturing to an area next to a small lake outside the window. Financial planner Emilio Valdez says the cost of living in the area has accelerated.\n                \n                    \n                    AAron Ontiveroz for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption That means many of the voters these candidates are trying to reach in this new district are also new to the area. \"Every year that I'm knocking on doors and talking to new people, it's always new voters over and over again,\" Kulmann said. \"So I think the bigger challenge is really making sure that they know that there's another election coming, because it feels like there's one every single year because there is one.\" There's plenty of room to grow the electorate here. A Colorado Sun analysis found that the 8th has the lowest share of active, registered voters of any district in the state. Much of the 8th has for the last decade been a Republican-leaning district, represented by Ken Buck. The new district's competitiveness may be one way to get voters enthused, says Subia. \"Once we can go out and inform the people around northern Colorado that, 'Hey, this is a totally new ballgame. We're in a new game and we can win this,' once we start doing that \u2014 we got to do it now because it's coming around the corner, and it comes fast,\" he said. That means motivating people who don't always vote, like Alfredo Gonzalez. He's a cook at a hotel, and an independent who didn't vote in 2020. So what does he need to hear from candidates this year? \"Well, for our documents, you know,\" he said, \"to be in this country legally.\" But he also said that the economy is his top issue \u2014 even while he personally isn't suffering. \"In fact, I have a good job. I'm doing fine. I mean, what matters is me having a job and security,\" he said. The hustle and bustle of Commerce City, Colo., unfolds in the foreground as Colorado's Rocky Mountains stand tall in the distance.\n                \n                    \n                    AAron Ontiveroz for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption The hustle and bustle of Commerce City, Colo., unfolds in the foreground as Colorado's Rocky Mountains stand tall in the distance. The tension between having employment and being concerned about the economy has been readily visible throughout the district lately. \"Help wanted\" signs abound \u2014 and so have labor strikes. Workers at local supermarket chain King Soopers were demonstrating in recent weeks, demanding better pay, benefits and conditions (the strike ended with the ratification of a new contract). The so-called working class \u2014 blue-collar, pink-collar and other service-industry workers in jobs that often don't require a college degree \u2014 has been slipping from the Democrats to the Republican Party in recent years. Republican strategist Mike Madrid says that winning more of those voters will mean winning over Latino voters. There is hope in the GOP that Democrats' advantage is slipping. Donald Trump won only around 3 in 10 Latino voters in 2016, but nearly 4 in 10 in 2020 \u2014 right around George W. Bush's 2004 high-water mark. Madrid says the GOP made those gains, in part, by getting away from Trump's racist 2016 messaging. \"All they need to do is get out of their own way and continue articulating their own populist economic messages that are resonating with white, non-college educated workers, because they are increasingly working with Latino, non-college educated workers,\" Madrid said. To Kulmann, connecting to the Latino community in the district means speaking to the issues that young families have.

            "article_content": "In this year's midterm elections, two seats in the Pacific Northwest flipped after years of one-party control. A look at the women who won these races.  SCOTT SIMON, HOST: Republicans gained 10 seats to control the House in these last elections, but many Democrats were elected for the first time, and they replaced outgoing members of their own party or won a seat from Republicans. Two district in the Pacific - districts in the Pacific Northwest flipped after years of one-party control, and each for different reasons. Troy Brynelson and Joni Auden Land of Oregon Public Broadcasting explain. MARIE GLUESENKAMP PEREZ: Hey, Mom, they called it. (Laughter). TROY BRYNELSON, BYLINE: In November, Marie Gluesenkamp Perez pulled off the biggest upset of the 2022 midterms. The Democrat from Washington state had seemingly come out of nowhere and flipped a district former President Donald Trump had won twice. Suddenly, she and her campaign manager scrambled to stage a nondescript Airbnb for national media interviews. PHIL GARDNER: CNN, Wolf Blitzer would like to talk to you in the next 30 minutes. So... GLUESENKAMP PEREZ: What do we do? GARDNER: We're going to do it right there. BRYNELSON: And so from the living room, she completed a congressional run barely anyone saw coming. She only entered the race in February and finished a distant fourth in fundraising before the primaries. Then she faced Trump acolyte Joe Kent in the general, who had just unseated a six-term Republican incumbent. So how did the auto shop owner from Skamania County pull it off? GLUESENKAMP PEREZ: Since we got here, we've installed much better air filters, a four-post lift. The machine shop is new. BRYNELSON: Like any politician, Gluesenkamp Perez tries to embody her district. Here in the southwestern part of the state, union shops in timber and aluminum used to carry Democrats. And the 34-year-old is the closest to a trades worker whom Democrats backed in at least a decade. She's unafraid to say both parties have hurt the working class and rural communities. GLUESENKAMP PEREZ: And that feels like home to voters. That feels like the representation they want right now in D.C. BRYNELSON: Being a newcomer also freed her from political baggage. She contrasted with Kent, a rising star in Trump's GOP. He campaigned on relitigating the 2020 election and other unproven, far-right ideas. GLUESENKAMP PEREZ: And I ran against a guy who had an R after his name but did not reflect the values of most conservatives I know. BRYNELSON: Among them were tens of thousands who still supported the incumbent, Jaime Herrera Butler, even after she broke Republican ranks to impeach Trump. Mel Kamerath from the industrial town of Kalama was on the fence until late October. When she sided with Gluesenkamp Perez, she volunteered to knock on doors, too. She saw many of her neighbors feeling lost. MEL KAMERATH: We have the Democrats who are always going to vote Democrat leader, and then we had this special middle group of people who had lost their candidate in Jaime. BRYNELSON: Gluesenkamp Perez outperformed the Democratic candidate for Senate thanks to gains in the district's rural towns, which she hopes to represent in the other Washington. GLUESENKAMP PEREZ: I'm going to be a tireless advocate working with people across the aisle, anywhere I can find to pass bills that get us moving in the right direction. BRYNELSON: She's trying to be realistic about committee assignments. She hopes she can help small businesses and timber. In southwest Washington, I'm Troy Brynelson. JONI AUDEN LAND, BYLINE: And I'm Joni Auden Land, a few hours south in Bend, Ore. For the first time in 28 years, a Republican has won Oregon's 5th Congressional District. Lori Chavez-DeRemer, a former small-town mayor, will take control of the seat in what has been a huge pickup for Republicans this year. Chavez-DeRemer says she adopted an aggressive campaign strategy that took her all over the large district, which was heavily redrawn in 2020. LORI CHAVEZ-DEREMER: I wanted to make sure that people knew who I was. People knew me in Happy Valley where I had served as mayor, but they didn't often know me as we headed south or over to central Oregon. So I made sure I spent time there. LAND: Chavez-DeRemer rarely mentioned former President Trump and often avoided discussing conservative social issues such as abortion. She says she will seek a seat on the House Transportation Committee. Part of her success was painting her opponent, Democrat Jamie McLeod-Skinner, as a progressive outsider, like in this campaign ad. (SOUNDBITE OF POLITICAL AD) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Take away the props, the cheap slogans and the empty promises. You're just left with an out-of-touch San Francisco-area politician pretending to be Oregonian. LAND: Redistricting greatly changed the shape of the district. This new 5th District is politically diverse and huge. It includes liberal strongholds like Portland and Bend, combined with conservative suburbs and rural mountain towns. The district leans slightly blue, but many have noted that Democrats in the area tend to lean more moderate. That could favor Republicans as they fight to maintain control of the seat. KURT SCHRADER: The Democrats lost (laughter). Should've had me as the standard bearer. We would have won. LAND: That is Kurt Schrader, the outgoing representative for Oregon's 5th District. He's been in that seat as a moderate Democrat for 12 years. However, he lost his primary to a more progressive challenger. Schrader got the backing of some big-name Democrats, namely President Joe Biden and Nancy Pelosi, but his moderate positions cost him support on the local level. Chavez-DeRemer, however, says transcending party lines can work to her advantage. CHAVEZ-DEREMER: I think I'm still going to be a good fit for this district based on the years of dedication and experience that I have put in in really changing the way we represent Oregonians. LAND: Soon, though, she will have to start campaigning for the 2024 election. Much like Washington's 3rd District, maintaining control of such a tight seat is hardly a guarantee.

The swearing in of a new Congress is now just a month away. Most of the top leadership positions for both parties in both chambers have been decided. But one has not. The Speaker of the House is the most powerful person on Capitol Hill and stands next after the vice president in the line of presidential succession. Kevin McCarthy of California is the Republican nominee for the job in the new, 118th Congress. But he first must win a majority of the whole House (or at least of those present and voting for a candidate) on January 3rd. Most observers agree that McCarthy does yet not have the 218 votes it would appear he needs. Might he fall short? Can he win with fewer than 218? And how long can he run the House if he barely wins the right to do so? We can look to history for help on all these questions. At a glance, the precedents suggest McCarthy will find a way to win on January 3rd. But at the same time, history suggests his prospects are far less promising when it comes to managing the majority and achieving its legislative and political goals. The road to Gingrich's House GOP \"revolution\" was rocky Being a Republican Speaker has often been challenging since Newt Gingrich of Georgia first grasped the big gavel in 1995. He was the first Republican to do so in 40 years, and some called the election that made it happen \"the Gingrich revolution.\" House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga. on Jan. 4, 1995.\n                \n                    \n                    Laura Patterson/CQ Roll Call via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption At that time, Gingrich ascended the House rostrum to cheers from his party ranks. Someone shouted \"It's a whole Newt world.\" But just two years later, reporters crowded into the House gallery with a far different air of anticipation.  It was January 7, 1997, and the 1996 elections (in which President Bill Clinton won a second term) had cost Gingrich a few seats in the House, but his party still had 19 more seats than the Democrats. Gingrich's high-profile and adversarial leadership style had been alienating even when it was successful. Most immediately on that January day, Gingrich was still battling a House Ethics Committee case regarding his unreported outside income. Several members of the Republican majority had bailed out, saying they would not vote for Gingrich again. The most senior among them, Banking Committee Chairman James Leach of Iowa said: \"Winning does not vindicate taking shortcuts with public ethics.\"  (Leach apparently liked that summation well enough to use it again, verbatim, when he voted for the impeachment of President Bill Clinton in December 1998.) But nearly two years earlier, when the question was Gingrich, Leach voted instead for a former member, Bob Michel of Illinois, the House Republican leader for 14 years before Gingrich displaced him. Two other Republicans cast their votes for Speaker for Leach, and a third voted for another former member.  Five other Republicans who had declined to back Gingrich simply voted \"present.\" Bill Archer of Texas, the influential chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, had been non-committal in the weeks after the election. On the day before the vote, he indicated he would vote for Gingrich; but reporters in the gallery still leaned forward when the clerk called Archer's name. \"Gingrich,\" he responded, in a voice that conveyed neither doubt nor certainty. Several members missed the vote entirely. In the end, Gingrich's 216 votes gave him a majority of the 425 who were present and named someone. But it was a sobering moment for the man some had hailed as the GOP's Moses after he led the party out of 40 years in the wilderness of minority status. It foretold some of the problems he would have within his own party later in the 105th Congress. Boehner learned that some in his ranks eschewed cooperation Gingrich's eventual successor, Dennis Hastert of Illinois, won four terms as Speaker with narrow majority margins but minimal drama. House Speaker Dennis Hastert, talks to the press October 17, 2001, outside the Capitol building in Washington, DC.\n                \n                    \n                    Manny Ceneta/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption McCarthy may be especially envious of Hastert's election in January 2001, when the Republican majority in the House was down to just 221 seats (more or less exactly where McCarthy finds it today). Hastert breezed to a third term with the gavel without much fuss at all. But no Republican Speaker has been quite so fortunate since. Hastert left Congress in 2007 and years later was sentenced to prison. The case involved money he paid in an attempt to cover up his sexual abuse of high-school aged boys when he was a wrestling coach in Illinois in the 1960s and 1970s. The Republican Party had lost its House majority in 2006 but seized it back with a net gain of 63 seats in 2010, the first midterm in the presidency of Democrat Barack Obama. That surge elevated veteran Republican John Boehner of Ohio to the Speakership in January 2011. While not himself part of the \"Tea Party\" wave, Boehner was next on the leadership ladder, and he was nominated by his party unanimously. Thereafter, Boehner worked hard at relationships both with Obama's White House and the Democratic majority in the Senate. Known for his affability and working-class origins, Boehner might have been the Republican best equipped for the political tasks he faced \u2013 which were much like those facing the new Speaker in 2023. But cooperation was not what some in his own ranks wanted. Boehner was barely re-elected Speaker in 2013, after Obama had been re-elected president. A dozen Republicans refused to vote for him, but he had enough of a majority to survive with 220 votes. Things had not improved much when Boehner again stood for re-election as Speaker in January 2015. While he had followed the dictates of his caucus and scuttled ambitious budget deals he might have done with Obama, a faction known as the House Freedom Caucus still organized him and held him to 216 votes. In September of 2015, Boehner announced he was quitting in mid-session even as he was attempting to negotiate an agreement to keep the government running without a shutdown. Boehner and Ryan struggled to wrangle the House Freedom Caucus At that moment, Boehner's No. 2 was McCarthy, who had moved up to House Majority Leader earlier that same year and seemed likely to be his successor.  But in an interview with Sean Hannity of Fox News, McCarthy seemed to suggest that his party's multiple hearings on an ambassador's death in Benghazi, Libya, had been intended to damage the political popularity of Hillary Clinton (who had been secretary of state at the time). After that, Republicans began casting about for an alternative to McCarthy. The House Freedom Caucus declined to support him. A consensus formed for Way and Means Chairman Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, who had been the party's nominee for vice president in 2012. Ryan was subsequently elected by the full House in October 2015 with 236 votes, an absolute majority of the members. Two years later he was re-elected with only member of the Republican majority dissenting. But Ryan, like Boehner, found the constant battle with the Freedom Caucus to be more than he could handle. Discouraged, still just 48, he announced in the spring of 2018 he would not stand for re-election. That fall, his party lost control of the House and Pelosi returned as Speaker and served for the next four years. Both Boehner and Ryan have since worked as lobbyists in Washington. Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., speaks in the House Chamber of the U.S. Capitol after being sworn in to Speaker of the House in Washington, on October 29, 2015.\n                \n                    \n                    Al Drago/CQ Roll Call/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Although Ryan encountered far less resistance to his election as Speaker, he had found much the same difficulty in carrying out the job. It was a replay of what Gingrich had found in the job in the late 1990s. \"Litmus-test Republicans\" made Gingrich's tenure tough Even after he had survived the ethics flap in January 1997, Gingrich found his once-grateful troops were restless. He faced down an open rebellion at a meeting of his caucus in the spring and that same summer escaped an attempted coup from within his own leadership team. When he achieved a major budget deal with President Clinton, he was criticized for it within the party. In 1998 the House's focus shifted in 1998 to a protracted battle over Clinton's impeachment, displeasing many swing voters. Clinton's Democrats wound up actually gaining seats in the midterms that November (the first such win for a sitting president in 66 years). Gingrich caught the blame for it and stepped down within days. One of Gingrich's confidantes in that era was Kenneth Duberstein, a former White House chief of staff for President Ronald Reagan, who spoke at the time to The New York Times. \"There was no doubt in mind [Gingrich] had the votes to win the Speakership [again],\" Duberstein said. \"But I'm not sure he had the votes to govern.\" By way of explanation, Duberstein said \"litmus-test Republicans\" who focused on single issues such as abortion, same-sex marriage or taxes made it impossible for anyone to be an effective Speaker. \"They were saying we want this and we want that and they were denying him the flexibility to be able to put a governing coalition together,\" Duberstein said. Gingrich could see that his next term at the top would be even rockier than his first two, and he chose to fall on his sword instead. It was a bitter moment that Boehner and Ryan would also taste in the decade ahead. Factions within the parties are, of course, as old as the parties themselves, which arose in the chamber more than 200 years ago. Intraparty wars have been especially virulent in eras of realignment within the electorate, or when substantial parts of the country have opposed a war \u2013 such as Vietnam or the First World War. Speakership woes go back to \"the last of the czars\" The last time the House could not find a first-ballot majority for a single candidate for Speaker was exactly 100 years ago in January 1923. Republicans had 225 seats but had just been rocked by a 75-seat loss in President Warren Harding's first midterm, which followed the wreckage of the Teapot Dome scandal and the House's own refusal to accept the results of the 1920 Census. Blocking a consensus at that time was an internal group of self-described progressives with the GOP who wanted changes to various rules and procedures favored by the party's Old Guard. In the 1923 round, it took nine ballots to consolidate a majority behind the man who had been the sitting Speaker, Frederick Gillett of Massachusetts. He alone was able to promise serious consideration of the desired reform package. But Gillett would soon be gone, trading the big gavel for a seat in the Senate two years later. It was in some respects an echo of the rebellion among progressives (in both parties) that had ousted Republican Speaker Joe Cannon of Illinois (the \"last of the czars\") in 1910. Cannon had and abused absolute power over committee chairs and assignments, floor procedure and rules for debate. No one since has had comparable authority. The Cannon House Office Building, the first such Hill building to bear a name, is named for him. It stands as a monument both to the pre-eminence of the Speakership and the impermanence of power.",

Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who announced she would not run for the top leadership post after Democrats lost control of the House in the midterms. The House Democratic Caucus has elected Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., to lead their caucus. As House minority leader, Jeffries will become the first Black person to lead a major political party in Congress. He is among a new slate of leaders elected Wednesday to lead House Democrats in the next session of Congress, including Rep. Katherine Clark, D-Mass., as Jeffries' No. 2, and Rep. Pete Aguilar, D-Calif., as the third-ranking leader. Jeffries, 52, who ran unopposed, is 30 years younger than House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Pelosi announced earlier this month she would remain in Congress, but not run for the leadership post she has held atop the Democratic caucus for nearly two decades after Republicans gained a razor-thin majority in the 2022 midterms. Pelosi praised the leadership team following the caucus election Wednesday, saying the new leaders will \"reinvigorate our Caucus with their new energy, ideas and perspective.\" At a press conference following the vote, Jeffries noted how his confirmation landed on the birthday of Shirley Chisholm, the first Black woman elected to Congress. As someone who represented some of the same neighborhoods that she did, Jeffries framed the significance of his election by reflecting on her legacy and what his party could learn from it. \"I stand on the shoulders of people like Shirley Chisolm and so many others as we work to advance the ball for everyday Americans,\" he said. \"That's our story, that's our legacy, that's our values, that's our commitment as we move forward: Get stuff done, make life better for everyday Americans.\" Rep. Jim Clyburn, D-S.C., who is 82 and has served in party leadership, said Tuesday night the shift taking place with the current slate of leaders stepping aside to make way for a new generation has been in the works for several years. \"I think that it was pretty clear to everybody that Pelosi, [Rep. Steny] Hoyer and myself would be making an exit from the leadership very soon, either under our own, or somebody carried us out,\" Clyburn said. Clyburn called the low-drama leadership change that House Democrats executed relatively quickly after a team that held power for roughly 15 years an \"evolution.\" Typically, coveted leadership posts rarely open up and contested races can get personal with camps working furiously to secure votes in a race decided via a secret ballot. \"I have studied history long enough to know that evolutions are much better than revolutions,\" Clyburn said. \"And I think that anybody watching their caucus, our caucus over the years, could see the evolving leadership.\" Speaking the night before the leadership elections, Jeffries told reporters that after Democrats won back the majority in 2018 he, Clark and Aguilar talked about joining the leadership table then and using the period to demonstrate they were up to the task to eventually move up the leadership ladder. Rep. Jason Crow, D-Colo., told NPR \"one thing I've learned in leadership is that you don't get to choose your moment. The moment presents itself, and it's up to you to decide how and when you're going to lead.\" Crow said Jeffries has a \"bottom up style of leadership,\" adding, \"one of his greatest strengths is recognizing the tremendous talent around him.\" Pelosi held a very narrow majority during this session of Congress, and the divisions between progressives and centrists often spilled into the open and stalled action on top priorities. Those on the left often wanted bolder policy proposals and more generous federal spending, while centrists argued for positions they maintained were more in step with voters in purple districts they represented and helped the party regain the majority in 2018. Jeffries told reporters there's \"nothing more unifying then being in the majority\" and said he and his colleagues are squarely focused on taking back the gavel in 2024. He acknowledged the caucus is \"a big family, and an enthusiastic family and sometimes a noisy family.\" In a veiled reference to the House GOP conference and its allegiance to former President Donald Trump, Jeffries added \"I'd much rather be a coalition than a cult.\" One younger House Democrat, Rep. Nanette Barrag\u00e1n, D-Calif., who was elected in 2016, told NPR she was excited about the major shift in who will lead her party in the House. Barrag\u00e1n pointed out that she and Jeffries come from similar backgrounds, with working-class parents. \"He understands what it's like to be a person of color, the discrimination that we face \u2014 as he likes to say it's about standing up for the left behind and the folks who aren't really having that say at the table.\" She said his style is to listen to the various factions inside the caucus and said he's traveled extensively around the country to visit with lawmakers in their districts. Pelosi tapped Jeffries to serve as an impeachment manager for the Senate trial in January of 2020 \u2014 a high profile position for those who would prosecute their case on national television. Crow was on the team and recounted a tense moment during the Senate trial when a protester burst into the chamber during Jeffries' presentation and it was unclear if he had a weapon or would threaten the lawmakers inside. As the Capitol Police worked to remove the person Crow looked up at Jeffries, who \"stopped, he collected himself, he quoted a scripture verse about how the Lord will protect his flock and stand by you. And then he picked right up where he left off and finished presenting his case. It just is one illustration of how he handles things and stays calm under pressure.\" Jeffries also showcased his Brooklyn roots during the trial when responding to Trump's lawyer who asked the House impeachment managers why they were even there pushing their case. He quoted Biggie Smalls, the rapper from his neighborhood known as \"the Notorious B.I.G.,\" as he finished his closing statement about the president's abuse of power saying, \"and if you don't know, now you know.\" Crow said that episode shows that Jeffries \"knows where he's going, but he also knows where he's from. And I think that's important as a person and as important as a leader to never forget your background, never forget who you are.\" Jeffries said he has an \"open mind\" in terms of his relationship with the top House Republican, Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., who was nominated to serve as the speaker. McCarthy is still working to secure the votes he needs to be elected by the full House. Jeffries said he has more experience with the incoming majority leader, Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., and said he would look for areas of common ground. But he stressed that McCarthy has a lot of members Jeffries considers \"extreme\" and he is prepared to oppose GOP efforts to push far-right policies. Juma Sei contributed to this report.",

A judge in Texas blocked Biden's plan to provide millions of borrowers with up to $20,000 apiece in federal student-loan forgiveness.\n                \n                    \n                    Evan Vucci/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption President Biden speaks about student loan debt relief at Delaware State University last month. A judge in Texas blocked Biden's plan to provide millions of borrowers with up to $20,000 apiece in federal student-loan forgiveness. President Biden's plan to erase federal student loan debts for tens of millions of borrowers hit a legal wall Thursday, when a U.S. District Court judge in Texas called it unlawful and vacated the debt relief program. The federal government quickly appealed the decision, which came just weeks before student loan payments are set to resume in January. The program was already on hold while a federal appeals court in St. Louis considers a separate lawsuit by six states challenging it. In Thursday's ruling, Judge Mark T. Pittman, who was appointed by former President Donald Trump, wrote that the program was a \"complete usurpation\" of congressional authority by the executive branch. Pittman rejected the Biden administration's arguments that, in a law known as the HEROES Act, Congress had already given the president the power to erase student loan debts in a time of national emergency and that the COVID-19 pandemic is just such an emergency. \"In this country, we are not ruled by an all-powerful executive with a pen and a phone,\" Pittman wrote. \"Instead, we are ruled by a Constitution that provides for three distinct and independent branches of government.\" \"We strongly disagree with the District Court's ruling on our student debt relief program,\" White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre said. \"The President and this Administration are determined to help working and middle-class Americans get back on their feet, while our opponents \u2013 backed by extreme Republican special interests \u2013 sued to block millions of Americans from getting much-needed relief.\" Late Thursday, the White House confirmed that it had already appealed the decision. That appeal will go to the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals, which has a reputation as the most conservative of all federal appeals courts. From there, another appeal would land this case at the U.S. Supreme Court, which has so far refused to hear challenges to Biden's relief plan. Borrowers likely won't have a final answer on debt relief for weeks. Meanwhile, student loan payments are set to resume in January. Back in September, U.S. Education Secretary Miguel Cardona told NPR he hoped to process as many debt relief applications as possible before that payment pause ends on Jan. 1. Thursday's decision makes it unlikely the department will reach that goal. President Biden announced on Nov. 3 that close to 26 million Americans had provided the necessary information to the Education Department to qualify for relief and that the department was already on track to approve cancellation for 16 million borrowers. Now, the department cannot cancel those loans without a reversal of fortune in the courts. The case at the center of Thursday's ruling was brought by the conservative Job Creators Network Foundation on behalf of two federal student loan borrowers who believe they were unfairly excluded from relief. One borrower's federal loans are held by a commercial lender, not the U.S. Department of Education, and don't qualify for relief. The other borrower does qualify for $10,000 in relief but believes, because he is currently low-income, that he should receive the same level of relief \u2013 $20,000 \u2013 as borrowers who were low-income at the time they attended college. The plaintiffs argued, among other things, that the Biden administration didn't follow federal rules and should have allowed borrowers, and the general public, to voice their concerns about eligibility before the program was rolled out, though the administration countered that the HEROES Act specifically allows it to forego this kind of process. \"This ruling protects the rule of law which requires all Americans to have their voices heard by their federal government ...\" said Elaine Parker, president of the Job Creators Network Foundation, in a Thursday statement. \"We hope that the court's decision today will lay the groundwork for real solutions to the student loan crisis.\" But borrower advocates and some legal experts were quick to find fault with the judge's decision. \"My first response was, this is motivated reasoning by a judge who wants to come to this result. The legal analysis is flawed,\" says Luke Herrine, an assistant professor of law at the University of Alabama. Persis Yu, managing counsel at the Student Borrower Protection Center, says there's an important disconnect between the harm the plaintiffs alleged \u2014 not receiving the debt cancellation they believe they should have \u2014 and the court's remedy: denying cancellation to all federal student loan borrowers. \"I like to think of this lawsuit as, like, the toddler problem. If I can't have it, you can't have it either,\" says Yu. \"And that's not how the law works. And it's not how the courts should apply the law.\" Pittman's decision catapults this case to the front of the line of cases opposing debt relief in federal court. In late October, a federal appeals court temporarily blocked Biden's relief plan before it could go into effect, so the court could consider a different suit, filed by six states \u2013 Nebraska, Missouri, Arkansas, Iowa, Kansas and South Carolina. The states argued that a handful of state-based loan servicers that manage old, privately-held federal loans, would be hurt financially if borrowers were allowed to consolidate these loans and qualify for debt cancellation. That suit had been dismissed by a U.S. district court judge in Missouri before the plaintiffs appealed to the 8th Circuit, which has yet to weigh in. In the 2020 presidential election, Biden pledged to cancel at least $10,000 per person in college debt. Biden finally announced his loan relief plan in August, promising to cancel up to $10,000 for borrowers who did not receive Pell grants, and $20,000 for those who did. Twenty-two Republican governors wrote Biden a letter in September challenging his authority to go forth with the forgiveness plan, and the Congressional Budget Office later estimated the initiative would cost $400 billion over the next 30 years.",

Since early last year, some of the most prolific spreaders of conspiracy theories have been barnstorming across the country alongside a stacked cast of pro-Trump speakers, preachers and self-proclaimed prophets. Each stop of the ReAwaken America Tour is part conservative Christian revival, part QAnon expo and part political rally. It features big name stars in the MAGA galaxy, including MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell, Trump adviser Roger Stone and former President Donald Trump's son, Eric. There are meet and greets, a buffet and, lately, baptisms and the casting out of demons. The show was conceived in the months after former national security adviser Michael Flynn received a pardon from Trump. Flynn connected with Clay Clark, an Oklahoma man who had been hosting local, anti-lockdown gatherings during the pandemic. The two put on their first event in Tulsa in April 2021. The most recent stop in Pennsylvania Amish country was their 16th show together. Clay Clark speaks to attendees of the ReAwaken America Tour held at the Spooky Nook Sports complex in Manheim, Pa., on Oct. 21.\n                \n                    \n                    Amanda Berg for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption \"Here, we go through two days of probably the best education you're ever going to get,\" Flynn told the audience. Between stage calls, \"America's General,\" as he's known in these circles, paced through the sports complex in a suit and red, white and blue sneakers. His partner, Clark, raced on and off stage with a clipboard and the unshakeable cheerfulness of his former career as a wedding DJ, to coordinate the speaking slots of the more than 70 presenters over two days. Clark is also a podcaster who is being sued for defamation by a former executive of Dominion Voting Systems over claims that aired on his show. Clay Clark takes notes off stage during the ReAwaken America Tour. A former wedding DJ, Clark began holding anti-lockdown protests early in the pandemic, which morphed into the tour's current incarnation.\n                \n                    \n                    Amanda Berg for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption \"I don't take any income or salary from these events and I do that because I'm not trying to get rich, I'm not trying to make it as a firebrand. I'm trying to save this nation,\" Clark told the crowd between acts. Plenty of money does change hands though. Dietary supplements, fluoride-free toothpaste, patriotic coffee and children's books like \"The Cat In The Maga Hat\" are all on sale. Bedazzled purses in the shape of a gun or the Titanic (a metaphor for the country) cost $500. Carson Massie was selling vibrating platforms you can stand on instead of exercising. \"Ten minutes on this is equal to an hour at the gym,\" said Massie. The units go for $3,300 each, a steal compared to other models on the market, he said. Their stand sells about 150 on an average ReAwaken day. After his speech, Roger Stone remained near the stage to pose for pictures with attendees. On either side of him were two people holding open large, clear garbage bags who collected cash donations toward Stone's legal and medical bills. Top: MAGA themed goods are sold.

I refuse donations. I know what I know could save a lot of lives because there's a scripture that says, my people perish for lack of knowledge,\" said Everett Triplett in a crisp, white cowboy hat and bolo tie.

Triplett believes God has shown him that a massive nuclear attack on the United States is imminent, all of which is explained in a free, glossy booklet. He said he wondered about some of the working-class attendees he sees stocking up on T-shirts and precious metals. \"Passionate people are easily talked out of their money when it comes to the things they're passionate about. They're generous. And so all these T-shirts, political stuff that has on it, the content that makes them go, whoop, whoop, whoop, they like it. They spend money,\" said Triplett, who admits he's bought a thing or two. In the very back of Triplett's free handout were his research recommendations. The list included Alex Jones' InfoWars, a John Birch Society speech and the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, a notorious, century-old antisemitic hoax. Its themes of a secret, Jewish plot for \"global domination\" and specifically, preying on children, all echo in the conspiracy theories of today. This is Mark Abrahams' second time at a ReAwaken tour stop. He says he's a big fan of one of the speakers, a British QAnon personality whose videos feature fictions about COVID-19, global currency upheaval and Satanic pedophiles.

You feel at home. You really do feel like you're in and amongst good people and that's a big difference,\" said Abrahams. Outside of events like the tour, Abrahams complained that there are no civil conversations anymore, just accusations of racism and homophobia. With his next breath he started to describe the need for vigilance on a hypothetical family trip with his grandchildren and his fears that his granddaughter would be assaulted by a transgender person. \"My granddaughter goes in and I see a masculine looking woman going into that bathroom. I'm stopping them. And if that person has not completed their transformation, I will physically finish it for them,\" said Abrahams. Minutes later, he invoked the Golden Rule of treating others as you'd want to be treated. Asked how he squared that with his own violent threats, Abrahams said, \"I square that with the Golden Rule because, if you know right from wrong, you're not a lady. You're not a woman. You're a man,\" and continued sharing his thoughts on transgender people. In reality, transgender people have been murdered at record numbers in the last two years and face disproportionally high rates of assault and other forms of abuse. Val Boland and Francine Fosdich converse during the ReAwaken America Tour held at the Spooky Nook Sports complex in Manheim, Pa., on Saturday, Oct. 22.\n                \n                    \n                    Amanda Berg for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption In an interview later, Clay Clark, the organizer, said he doesn't agree with anyone who \"endorses violence as a means to end disagreement.\" But pressed about the weekend's prominent strain of anti-trans and homophobic rhetoric, and what responsibility he assumes for any messages about evil, demons and pedophiles his audience may leave with, Clark finally offered this: \"I agree with what you just said. Yeah, I think you saw it in Nazi Germany. You put a star on people and you dehumanize them,\" said Clark. \"I also think putting a mask on someone is dehumanizing.\" Last year, Georgia U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene had to publicly apologize for repeatedly making the same comparison, and said the remark was \"offensive.\" But at the ReAwaken tour, the analogy was commonplace. Despite repeated false claims from the speakers onstage that the 2020 election was stolen, most attendees said they plan to vote in next week's midterm elections. Speakers like Flynn urged them to add poll watching and continued political organizing to their schedules. \"Local action equals national impact,\" Flynn has said throughout the tour. From the same stage, earlier that day, Julie Green, an ally of Pennsylvania Republican gubernatorial candidate Doug Mastriano, told the audience God had spoken to her and sent a prophecy. \"These are the days for you to control the governments of this earth,\" said Green to huge applause.

He doesn't need an election to do it.\" Events like ReAwaken serve as a kind of worship service, said Anthea Butler, chair of the University of Pennsylvania's religious studies department, \"There are all the elements of Christian churches, except it's not in the church. Right? So all of those things that people get sociologically from church connection, validation, affirmation, all of those things are happening in these sorts of places,\" said Butler. She traced the prophecies and charismatic preaching to a movement from the 1990s called the New Apostolic Reformation. Its leaders believe there are present-day apostles and prophets fighting evil forces. Add in election denial, vaccine and anti-government conspiracism and it's a very potent mix that Butler says the Republican Party has largely embraced. \"You've always had conspiracy theories in American religion,\" says Butler. \"There's always been people who have thought about, 'what is going to happen in the end times' or 'when is the world going to come to an end.' The real question you want to ask is, why aren't they talking about that anymore?\" Deborah from New York City poses for a photo in her \"good vibes jacket\" during the ReAwaken America Tour held at the Spooky Nook Sports complex in Manheim, Pa., on Oct. 21.\n                \n                    \n                    Amanda Berg for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption",

Butts III, pastor of Harlem's legendary Abyssinian Baptist Church, died on Friday at home in New York City. He was 73. The Rev. Calvin O. Butts III, pastor and powerbroker, died on Friday at home in New York City. He was 73. His son Calvin O. Butts IV, says the cause of death was pancreatic cancer. For more than 30 years, Butts was senior pastor at Harlem's legendary Abyssinian Baptist Church, a more than 200-year-old institution founded in 1808, which itself was a center of Harlem's spiritual and political life. Butts inherited the pulpit from a long line of charismatic ministers, including Adam Clayton Powell Sr., his son Adam Jr., and Samuel Proctor. The church was declared a New York City landmark in 1993. With his erudite, sometimes pointed sermons, Butts ministered to Abyssinian's thousands of members and to visitors from around the globe. Congregants crowded into the ornate Gothic church on 138th Street to hear Butts expound on social justice, economic parity and the need for neighbors to \"love one another.\" In a statement Friday, New York Mayor Eric Adams said Butts mentored him during some of the city's most difficult moments. \"The City has lost a real giant,\" Adams said. Born in Bridgeport, Conn., on July 19, 1949 to working class parents, Butts and his family moved to New York City when he was a child. After graduating from public high school in Queens, he went South, to Morehouse College in Atlanta, where he followed in the footsteps of Morehouse men such as Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., civil rights leader Julian Bond and Surgeon General David Satcher. He returned to New York to receive a master's degree from Union Theological Seminary and, eventually, a doctorate from Drew University. Butts began working at Abyssinian as an office assistant while he was a young parent in graduate school, and started moving up the church's hierarchy. In 1989, he was named Abyssinian's head pastor. At the time, Harlem was rich in history but poor in resources. The same year he became head pastor, Butts formed the Abyssinian Development Corporation, which aimed to create viable housing and businesses that would include Harlem residents, many of whom were in danger of being pushed out by looming gentrification. (Some would argue that with his development partnerships, Butts was merely hastening the inevitable.) Political as well as pastoral, Butts sometimes was part of a circle that included powerful politicians and civic leaders, such as former Congressman Charles Rangel, former Manhattan Borough Chief Percy Sutton and former Mayor David Dinkins. (He criticized them when he felt he had to and worked with them when they needed each other.) Rev. Dr. Calvin O.

Dr. Calvin O. Butts III, speaks onstage during the Andr\u00e9 Leon Talley Celebration of Life at The Abyssinian Baptist Church on April 29 in New York City. When a Black man was killed while running from white assailants in Howard Beach, Queens, in 1985, there was fury in the Black community. Michael Griffith had been trying to escape being beaten to death by young white men who were outraged he was in \"their\" neighborhood. Butts used his prominence as Abyssinian's head pastor to (with others) push to have a special prosecutor try the case, which resulted in convictions for several of the assailants. He persuaded Congressman John Conyers Jr., to create a commission to investigate police brutality in Black communities. Though he saw himself as a \"race man,\" Butts did not automatically back all Black people. He famously bumped heads with the Rev. Al Sharpton from time to time in the early days of Sharpton's career, finding the bombastic activist too militant and impulsive for comfort back then. He did not intervene or issue a statement when the infamous Tawana Brawley case became national news in 1987. Sharpton positioned himself as Brawley's champion when she claimed to have been kidnapped and assaulted by four white men. That turned out to be a hoax. But as Sharpton said in a statement on Butts' death Friday, \"While we did not always agree, we always came together.\" Butts also raised eyebrows in 2008 when he supported Hillary Clinton over Barack Obama (something several Black politicians, including the Rev. John Lewis did) proclaiming the endorsement \"was not and is not and will not become a race-based decision for me.\" (Later he declared himself \"overjoyed\" with Obama's election.) In addition to pastoring Abyssinian, Butts served as president of the State University of New York's Old Westbury campus on Long Island from 1999-2020. Reverend Butts was my pastor.

As of now, there is one empty seat on the 15-member body after one of the three recorded members resigned, and the remaining members who weren't part of the racist conversation have all publicly demanded that the two others resign, going as far as stripping them of nearly all their committee assignments. And on Sunday, California Gov. Gavin Newsom said he is \"looking forward\" to an announcement of the two council members' departures soon. But despite the outcry, Gil Cedillo and Kevin de Le\u00f3n refuse to quit, expecting they can wait out the storm of fallout for their participation in a racist conversation in which they and former City Council President Nury Martinez disparaged a white colleague's adopted 2-year-old Black son and discussed strategies to consolidate their power at the expense of Black leadership. Martinez stepped down days after the audio was leaked. Their insistence to stay on means both men will continue to draw from their hefty salaries at the expense of irate taxpayers, even as they skip out on City Council meetings where the public continues to demand their ouster. In 2021, LA City Council members took home roughly $218,000 in pay, according to the California State Controller's Office, which gets its information from the city's W-2 tax forms. And there's more than just their base salaries \u2014 as city employees, they get about $66,000 a year toward their pensions. Taxpayers are also footing the bill for a car for each member, as well as meal and travel expenses. Taking away the extras, the average member's base salary is about $70,000 higher than those of council members in San Francisco and New York. It's also about $35,000 a year more than the governor of California's pay, which was about $183,000 in 2021. The discrepancy between what council members are paid and what many of their constituents make is even greater, especially when zeroing in on the incomes of people who live in pockets of de Le\u00f3n's and Cedillo's districts. In Boyle Heights, a largely Latino working-class neighborhood in de Le\u00f3n's district, for example, the median household income, according to the latest Census Bureau figures available, is about $44,000. And about 26% of people are living in poverty. In Chinatown, which is in Cedillo's district, the median household income is just under $50,000. As of now, there's no indication that either de Le\u00f3n or Cedillo plans to step down, short of a recall election. De Le\u00f3n went on English- and Spanish-language television last week to apologize for his role in the inflammatory conversation and to clarify that he is not resigning. \"I have to do the hard work to repair the ties with my brothers and with my sisters in our African American community,\" he said, insisting that stepping down would be the easy way out. And a spokesman for Cedillo said that the veteran Latino leader remains at \"a place of reflection.\" Meanwhile, Cedillo and de Le\u00f3n have avoided council meetings in recent days. De Le\u00f3n has been removed as head of the Homelessness and Poverty Committee as well as the Budget and Finance Committee. Cedillo was also removed as chair of the Housing Committee and a committee that reviews major development projects. If de Le\u00f3n manages to out the remaining two years of his term, taxpayers will be paying him about $568,000 in combined salary and pension. The tab for Cedillo, whose term ends in December, will be a lot less, though at roughly $18,000 a month in salary, it adds up to a minimum of $36,000 that he will have been paid since the scandal broke.",

ST. LOUIS, Mo. \u2014 A federal judge on Thursday dismissed an effort by six Republican-led states to block the Biden administration's plan to forgive student loan debt for tens of millions of Americans.U.S. District Judge Henry Autrey in St. Louis wrote that because the six states \u2014 Nebraska, Missouri, Arkansas, Iowa, Kansas and South Carolina \u2014 failed to establish they had standing, \"the Court lacks jurisdiction to hear this case.\"Suzanne Gage, spokeswoman for Nebraska Attorney General Doug Peterson, said the states will appeal. She said in a statement that the states \"continue to believe that they do in fact have standing to raise their important legal challenges.\"Democratic President Joe Biden announced in August that his administration would cancel up to $20,000 in education debt for huge numbers of borrowers. The announcement immediately became a major political issue ahead of the November midterm elections.The states' lawsuit is among a few that have been filed. Earlier Thursday, Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett rejected an appeal from a Wisconsin taxpayers group seeking to stop the debt cancellation program. Barrett, who oversees emergency appeals from Wisconsin and neighboring states, did not comment in turning away the appeal from the Brown County Taxpayers Association. The group wrote in its Supreme Court filing that it needed an emergency order because the administration could begin canceling outstanding student debt as soon as Sunday. In the lawsuit brought by the states, lawyers for the administration said the Department of Education has \"broad authority to manage the federal student financial aid programs.\" A court filing stated that the 2003 Higher Education Relief Opportunities for Students Act, or HEROES Act, allows the secretary of education to waive or modify terms of federal student loans in times of war or national emergency.\"COVID-19 is such an emergency,\" the filing stated.The Congressional Budget Office has said the program will cost about $400 billion over the next three decades. James Campbell, an attorney for the Nebraska attorney general's office, told Autrey at an Oct. 12 hearing that the administration is acting outside its authorities in a way that will cost states millions of dollars.The plan would cancel $10,000 in student loan debt for those making less than $125,000 or households with less than $250,000 in income. Pell Grant recipients, who typically demonstrate more financial need, will get an additional $10,000 in debt forgiven.Conservative attorneys, Republican lawmakers and business-oriented groups have asserted that Biden overstepped his authority in taking such sweeping action without the assent of Congress. They called it an unfair government giveaway for relatively affluent people at the expense of taxpayers who didn't pursue higher education.Chris Nuelle, spokesman for Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt, said the plan \"will unfairly burden working class families with even more economic woes.\"Many Democratic lawmakers facing tough reelection contests have distanced themselves from the plan.The HEROES Act was enacted after 9/11 to help members of the military. The Justice Department says the law allows Biden to reduce or erase student loan debt during a national emergency. Republicans argue the administration is misinterpreting the law, in part because the pandemic no longer qualifies as a national emergency.Justice Department attorney Brian Netter told Autrey that fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic is still rippling. He said student loan defaults have skyrocketed over the past 2 1/2 years.The cancellation applies to federal student loans used to attend undergraduate and graduate school, along with Parent Plus loans. Current college students qualify if their loans were disbursed before July 1.The plan makes 43 million borrowers eligible for some debt forgiveness, with 20 million who could get their debt erased entirely, according to the administration.",

In celebration of Latinx Heritage Month, NPR Music is spotlighting a series of artists across Latin America who are engaging with their musical heritage in unique ways. From reworking conservative genres for new eras, to teasing out modern sounds from old-school instruments, these artists represent the wide range of experimentation that makes up contemporary Latin music. In certain parts of Brazil, it's nearly impossible to escape the sound of sertanejo. Deep in the countryside, in the small towns that line soybean farms and endless stretches of land, you won't find bikinis, coconut water or samba for miles. This is the land of country music and cowboy hats. \"It doesn't matter where you are \u2014 every dive bar or restaurant will be playing it,\" says singer Gabeu, who grew up in Franca, a small city in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo. \"That or a duo will be performing sertanejo songs live.\" Melding elements of rock, pop and forr\u00f3, the melodic genre is often touted as Brazil's alternative to American country music. But it's also more complicated than that. \"Unlike country, sertanejo is distinctly Latin American,\" says Gabeu, speaking via Zoom from his living room couch in S\u00e3o Paulo. \"It draws inspiration from Paraguayan genres [such as the guaran\u00eda or the polka], for example. Maybe that's why it's hard to fully explain what it is.\" What is certain, however, is that it is the biggest genre in the country. Consistently topping the national charts, sertanejo is an increasingly popular \u2014 and lucrative \u2014 industry. Last year, 60% of the top hits played on Brazilian radio fell under the genre. Part of what makes the genre so successful is that its artists are decidedly earnest. It's common in sertanejo for lovelorn musicians to sing about longing and heartbreak \u2014 experiences people often relate to. But not everyone can see themselves in these stories. Growing up, Gabeu, the son of well-known sertanejo artist Solim\u00f5es, could never relate to the straight, heteronormative ballads around him. So on his 2021 debut album AGROPOC, which earned a Latin Grammy nomination this year for best sertaneja music album, he set out to change that by singing about finding queer love in the country's largely conservative heartland. Part of a new scene called \"queernejo,\" Gabeu, 24, is among a group of artists leading the charge in the creation of a new kind of sertanejo \u2014 one which carves out space for more than one kind of love story. That starts with flipping the image of the macho cowboy on its head. For as long as Gabeu can remember, sertanejo singers have been straight. And while they may no longer look exactly like they did in the '90s \u2014 women, for example, now hold an increasingly larger stake in the genre \u2014 conventional gender stereotypes and heteronormativity still loom large. \"These days the look can feel more modern for men, it's more polo shirts and jeans, less traditional,\" says Gabeu. \"Maybe a cowboy hat or a big belt buckle once in a while.\" But, at its core, the genre's relationship with traditional gender dynamics and aesthetics has largely stayed the same, he explains. Gabeu started feeling like the odd one out in his city when he was a teenager. The longer he spent at sertanejo shows and drinking in the barzinhos around town, the more he realized these spaces weren't meant for him. \"I was beginning to understand my sexuality and just couldn't see myself in any of it,\" says Gabeu, running a hand through his short, flame-colored hair. \"That's when I started listening to American pop.\" Finding Lady Gaga helped. \"I loved all the divas, but she was the main one for me,\" he adds with a laugh. \"At one point, I really was that annoying fan.\" Moving away from Franca to study film in S\u00e3o Paulo was another turning point. \"While I was there, I started getting to know queer artists who were daring to try their hand at genres that weren't pop: people from working class neighborhoods that made hip-hop, queer musicians from the northeast making brega funk,\" an energetic style of dance music born in Recife, Brazil. It soon became clear that if they could do it, he could do it too. The way Gabeu sees it, sertanejo has a lot to gain from mingling with other genres, from pop to American country to tecno brega. \"I wanted AGROPOC to be playful,\" he says. \"Every song points in a different direction.\" Lyrically, Gabeu's strength lies in his ability to craft evocative scenes out of personal experience \u2014 a characteristic shared by the best sertanejos. \"How much longer do we have to love in the dark?\" he asks in the track \"Amor Rural\" over a jangly guitar lick. \"Every piece of this farm is hiding the truth.\" AGROPOC opens with a fake radio message broadcast in an imaginary world. \"This is AGROPOC, the most popular sertanejo radio station in the country,\" says Gabeu in the first track. It's wishful thinking, he tells me, but not necessarily impossible. In 2020, Gabeu and non-binary sertanejo artist Gali Gal\u00f3 launched the country's first queernejo music festival, Fivela Fest. Bringing together live performances and talks, it sought to introduce the genre to a wider audience. \"People like Alice Marcone, Reddy Allor and Zerzil performed,\" says Gabeu. \"It wasn't hugely popular, but we managed to reach our audience.\" For Gabeu, it's impossible to separate the onset of queernejo from Brazil's broader political situation. Over the course of the past four years, a remarkable number of sertanejo artists have spoken out in favor of Brazil's far-right, anti-LGBTQ+ President Jair Bolsonaro. \"That really messed with me,\" says Gabeu. It was also about what the president represented to Gabeu. \"I remember having a horrible experience around the time Bolsonaro was elected at a Shania Twain concert in Barretos.\" During the show, Twain invited a gay couple onto the stage and one of them proposed. \"I've never heard so much booing in my life,\" the artist says. In some ways, the genre's support for the president is still ongoing. In 2018, leading artist Gusttavo Lima declared his support for the president in a video in which he is seen shooting a rifle. Ahead of the presidential election on Oct. 2, the duo Mateus e Cristiano launched a jingle for Bolsonaro's campaign. Still, the scene is changing. \"In some ways, queernejo was born out of this gigantic need to redefine the genre's relationship with Bolsonarismo,\" says Gabeu. \"It's also why we try to reclaim symbols too, even when it might seem like we're leaning on stereotypes: I want people to look at a cowboy hat and not see a Bolsonaro supporter.\" This feels like a distant reality, but recent strides made by queer country artists in North America such as Orville Peck, whose song \"Dead of Night\" scored a highly discussed scene in the HBO hit series Euphoria this year, make him hopeful. For Gabeu, there's no reason queernejo can't enter the Brazilian mainstream in the same way one day. For now, however, his focus is reaching queer Brazilians who, like him, grew up thinking sertanejo wasn't for them. \"There are so many people in the LGBTQ+ community living in the countryside,\" he says. \"How crazy is it to think that this is the first time they've been able to see and hear themselves in the genre?\" It's no surprise many might feel inclined to change the radio station when sertanejo plays. But, if they hear a queernejo song instead, they might be inclined to keep listening. Carolina Abbott Galv\u00e3o is a researcher at Monocle magazine.

ROME \u2014 The coalition led by far-right leader Giorgia Meloni won the most votes in elections held Sunday and appears set to form Italy's first far-right government since World War II, provisional results show. Near-final results showed the center-right coalition netting some 44% of the parliamentary vote, with Meloni's Brothers of Italy party getting 26%. Her coalition partners divided up the remainder, with the anti-immigrant League of Matteo Salvini winning nearly 9% and the more moderate Forza Italia of ex-Premier Silvio Berlusconi took around 8%. The center-left Democratic Party and its allies had around 26%, while the 5-Star Movement \u2014 which had been the biggest vote-getter in 2018 Parliamentary elections \u2014 saw its share of the vote halved to some 15% this time around. Turnout was a historic low 64%. Pollsters suggested voters stayed home in part in protest and also because they were disenchanted by the backroom deals that had created the three governments since the previous election. In a late night victory speech on Sunday, Meloni thanked those Italians who didn't believe what she called \"lies\" about her and her party. She said the result shows that most Italians want her party to lead the government. She also said she regrets so many Italians did not vote. Turnout was 64%, the lowest for a general election in almost 50 years. \"It's important to understand that if we're called to govern this nation, we will do so for all Italians,\" Meloni said, adding that \"we will do so with the goal of uniting the people.\" Fratelli d'Italia has its origins in the Italian Social Movement, which was created by supporters of fascist dictator Benito Mussolini in the aftermath of World War II. Its leader, 45-year-old Meloni, is poised to become Italy's first female prime minister. She already has plans to form a coalition with two smaller right-wing parties: the hard-right, anti-immigrant Lega (League), led by former interior minister Matteo Salvini, and the center-right Forza Italia, led by three-time former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi. The main center-left party, the Democratic Party (PD), conceded defeat and is set to be the largest opposition party. Meloni has cultivated an image of a strong everywoman who criticizes \"Brussels bureaucrats\" and identifies with the needs of ordinary people. But as a teenager, Meloni joined the youth chapter of the Italian Social Movement, which used fantasy novels like J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord Of The Rings to recast fascist ideas, says Guido Caldiron, an Italian journalist who covers fascism and the far right. \"Tolkien gave them new ways to talk about their ideology where they were not the bad guys but communitarians protecting their kingdoms and traditions,\" he says. Meloni grew up in the working-class Garbatella neighborhood in Rome, where most voters support leftist parties. \"She's definitely not part of the spirit of this neighborhood,\" says Michela Mancurti, a retired United Nations officer who was among a crowd of voters outside a polling station on Sunday. \"Many of us are here voting to try to prevent her from winning.\" But NPR did speak to a few Meloni fans, including Tiziana Pipistrello, who works in advertising. Pipistrello rolls her eyes when others in the neighborhood call Meloni a fascist. \"Enough, enough with that fascism business,\" she says. \"That all happened a long time ago.\" Caldiron, the fascism expert, says politicians who belong to parties with fascist roots have been normalized in Italian politics since Berlusconi, the former prime minister, brought them into his governments. \"Meloni didn't have to do much work to convince some Italians that she won't bring back fascism in Italy,\" Caldiron says. But there is concern that she could take Italy down the path of illiberal democracies such as Hungary, where longtime prime minister Viktor Orban has hollowed out democratic institutions including free courts, independent media and civil rights. \"It's not fascism but it's still a threat,\" Caldiron says. Meloni's alliance with Orban has rattled EU leaders but she has stuck by the EU line on the most pressing issue: Russia's war on Ukraine. Her party has staunchly supported Ukraine's sovereignty and has approved sending weapons to Ukrainian forces. Her coalition partners, Salvini and Berlusconi, are both admirers of Russian President Vladimir Putin but have tried to distance themselves from Putin during the campaign.

            "article_content": "Democratic candidates pick up momentum as the elections near. The additional revelations surrounding the search of Mar-a-Lago could help them.  SCOTT SIMON, HOST: Of course, the economy may be the central issue in the midterm elections that will soon be here. NPR senior editor and correspondent Ron Elving joins us. Good morning, Ron. RON ELVING, BYLINE: Good to be with you, Scott. SIMON: What are some of the implications of Chairman Powell warning about pain for households and businesses? ELVING: Powell's point was to warn the business world of economic pain, higher costs of borrowing, possibly a recession. But beyond that, he was signaling pain to politicians as well, which follows as night follows day. If there's a recession, even a brief or a shallow one, it will cost current members of Congress in the midterms. And in the past, that has meant a drubbing for the party of the president, Republican or Democrat, especially when a president's party has even a nominal majority in Congress. In recent weeks, there's been a lot of non-economic news to talk about, but with more big increases coming in interest rates, the economic issues could be back with a vengeance this fall. SIMON: We, of course, have been talking about how inflation could dim the prospects for Democrats, but would they rather run with inflation or a recession? ELVING: Well, they'd rather have neither. But a lot depends on what's leading the news come October. Inflation is the present danger, but waiting on deck is that prospect of recession. That could be a shock for voters who have come to expect jobs to be plentiful and wages negotiable and homes affordable because interest rates were historically low. Democrats have been in a bit of a sweet spot this summer with less inflation and a strong jobs market. Also with a lot of negative news about the former president and some of the Republicans running for the Senate, there's no question things have been getting better for Democrats. The question is, will this be as good as it gets? And if so, will it be enough to limit the damage in November? SIMON: Of course, the FBI released, as ordered, their affidavit for the search of President Trump's - former President Trump's residence at Mar-a-Lago. Reading between all those black lines that redact information, what does the affidavit tell us? ELVING: First of all, we know that the trove down there at Mar-a-Lago included many documents at various levels of classification that were simply not Trump's to take, despite his assertions to the contrary. We also know the National Archives and the Justice Department had been trying for more than a year to get all the presidential papers returned. And what we can see of the redacted affidavit - about half of it - also makes clear that these documents had highly sensitive information about clandestine sources of information, human sources, as opposed to some sort of technology. We do not know what else may have been at risk due to the redactions. We still don't know why he took these box loads of documents. Theories abound, but we are going to have to wait to see more if and when Trump is actually charged with a crime. SIMON: And at the same time, are there signs that Donald Trump's mounting legal troubles help Democrats in the midterms, or, for that matter, his own political prospects? ELVING: Trump's troubles are clearly a better story for Democrats than the economy or the one-year anniversary of the Afghanistan withdrawal. Of course, the Mar-a-Lago search can help Trump and his party, too, in a sense. It gives them something to rally around, a better set of talking points than the January 6 investigation. But the Democrats also have some other assets right now. They got their budget bill through at long last addressing climate change, expanding health care, among other things. And they are getting a major boost from abortion rights supporters. Women are out-registering men this summer, and it's making a difference in contested races, like the special election for Congress that the Democrats won in New York last week. SIMON: Finally, Ron, President Biden this week signed a student debt proposal that forgives up to $20,000 if they meet income and other requirements. But there have been sharp criticisms - some Democrats, as well as Republicans, calling it elitist and an insult to the working class. ELVING: There is blowback from those who resent the tilt of the benefits to those who are able to go to college in the first place. That resentment would have been much worse had Biden simply wiped out all those debts, as many were urging him to do. What happened here was a compromise that involves far less money from the government and provides a basic benefit where it's needed most. There are a lot of working-class families with kids who have student debt. And yes, the White House is no doubt aware that Biden's support among young voters had fallen off quite a bit since they favored him so strongly over Trump in 2020. And yes, this has to be seen as a bid for their attention as well. SIMON: Ron Elving, unredacted senior editor and correspondent, thanks so much for joining us. ELVING: Thank you, Scott.

The pledge has followed his administration ever since.\n                \n                    \n                    Brendan Smialowski/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption More than two years ago, then-presidential candidate Joe Biden pledged to cancel at least $10,000 in federal student loans. The pledge has followed his administration ever since. On Wednesday, President Biden announced a sweeping effort to forgive up to $20,000 of federal student loan debt for Pell Grant recipients, and up to $10,000 for other qualifying borrowers. Biden also extended the federal student loan payment pause through Dec. 31. \"In keeping with my campaign promise, my Administration is announcing a plan to give working and middle class families breathing room as they prepare to resume federal student loan payments in January 2023,\" Biden said in a tweet on Wednesday. U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona said in a statement, \"Today, we're delivering targeted relief that will help ensure borrowers are not placed in a worse position financially because of the pandemic, and restore trust in a system that should be creating opportunity, not a debt trap.\" To qualify for the $10,000 forgiveness, individual borrowers must earn less than $125,000 a year, or less than $250,000 a year for couples. To qualify for the $20,000 forgiveness, borrowers must meet those income requirements and must have received a Pell Grant in college. Pell Grants are designed to help low-income students pay for higher education. On Wednesday, President Biden announced a sweeping effort to forgive up to $20,000 of federal student loan debt for Pell Grant recipients, and up to $10,000 for other qualifying borrowers. https://t.co/ohtRZkni81 pic.twitter.com/yE5p4IZ7Hn The Department of Education estimates that, among borrowers who are no longer in school, nearly 90% of relief dollars will go to those earning less than $75,000 a year. About 43 million borrowers will benefit, and 20 million will have their debt completely canceled, according to a senior administration official. The White House said more than 60% of current federal student loan borrowers also received Pell Grants. According to the White House, Parent PLUS loans will also qualify for cancellation under the new policy. In order to benefit, though, most borrowers will have to submit an application to verify their income. The Education Department said nearly 8 million borrowers already have income information on file, and should qualify to have their debts canceled automatically. The department will announce further details on how borrowers can claim this relief in the weeks ahead. Many borrowers are celebrating Biden's announcement: Giselle Parks of Orlando, Fla., expects to have her $5,000 in student loan debt completely erased. \"Holy cow,\" she said. \"Holy cow... I need to tell my family immediately!\" Trianna Downing in D.C. said she was in shock. \"I can't even process it yet... At first I was, like, dancing, and then I was like, wait, should I log into my account and see if it actually happened?\" Downing expects her debts to drop from $16,000 to $6,000. \"This is going to change and save lives,\" tweeted Rep. Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, who has long advocated for student loan forgiveness. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, also of Massachusetts, highlighted the ways Biden's plan could help address racial inequalities: \"Because Black Americans borrow more money to go to school, borrow more money in school and have a harder time paying their debt off after school, the President's action will also help narrow the racial wealth gap in the United States among borrowers.\" According to a 2016 Brookings analysis, \"The moment they earn their bachelor's degrees, black college graduates owe $7,400 more on average than their white peers... Differences in interest accrual and graduate school borrowing lead to black graduates holding nearly $53,000 in student loan debt four years after graduation \u2014 almost twice as much as their white counterparts.\" Some higher-debt borrowers were left disappointed by Wednesday's announcement, especially after a group of House and Senate Democrats, including Pressley and Warren, had called on Biden to cancel $50,000 in federal student debt. \"It's hard to be excited about it,\" says Briana Ford of Columbia, S.C. She's a Black borrower who owes almost $60,000 in student loans. \"I wouldn't give it back, but it's hard to be excited about it.\" Republicans aren't too excited either. They've long argued against broad-based loan forgiveness. \"This is a slap in the face to those who never went to college, as well as borrowers who upheld their responsibility to taxpayers and paid back their loans,\" said Rep. Virginia Foxx of North Carolina, the top Republican on the House Education Committee, in a Tuesday night statement. Many economists and higher education experts also opposed the move, arguing that widespread debt cancellation would do nothing to fix the rising costs of college. In a May analysis, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimated a policy like the one Biden announced would cost at least $230 billion, and warned that even income limits \"would do almost nothing to alleviate the central issues with the policy, namely that it is regressive, inflationary, expensive, and would likely do more to increase the cost of higher education going forward than to reduce it.\" This question has been at the heart of the debt cancellation debate for several years now. After all, any move that essentially requires the government to spend money (or lose it) generally has to go through Congress. Right? Perhaps anticipating legal pushback, the Biden administration published its legal reasoning in a memorandum at the same time it announced the debt cancellation package. The memo says The HEROES Act, first enacted after the September 11 attacks, gives the Education Secretary the power to grant relief from student loan requirements during specific periods, think: wartime or a national emergency. As such, the memo argues, \"in present circumstances, this authority could be used to effectuate a program of categorical debt cancellation directed at addressing the financial harms caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\" The administration made a similar argument in justifying its renovation of the troubled Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. That said, it's possible, perhaps likely, the move will be challenged in court. Experts have expressed concern that broad-based student loan forgiveness would exacerbate inflation, which is already one of Biden's greatest political weaknesses heading into this fall's midterm elections. \"Student loan debt relief is spending that raises demand and increases inflation,\" tweeted former U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers earlier this week. \"It consumes resources that could be better used helping those who did not, for whatever reason, have the chance to attend college. It will also tend to be inflationary by raising tuitions.\" Summers' opposition stirred considerable dissent. \"You have to tell a pretty bizarre story about expectations in order for loan forgiveness to boost inflation,\" responded Susan Dynarski, an economist and professor at the Harvard Graduate School of Education. \"No one has been making student loan payments for two years. Forgiveness will *not* increase cash flow to borrowers right now. That increase in available cash happened *2 years ago* when payments were suspended.\" The loan forgiveness announcement comes more than two years after then-presidential candidate Joe Biden pledged to cancel at least $10,000 in federal student loans. The pledge has followed the administration since. Wednesday's move comes after several extensions to the student loan moratorium, and attempts by some Democrats to expand forgiveness from the original plan to $50,000. In June, an NPR/Ipsos poll found a majority of the general public (55%) supported forgiving up to $10,000 of a person's federal student loan debt. But the more generous the relief, the more that support narrowed. Forty-seven percent of all respondents said they supported forgiving up to $50,000 in debt, while 41% expressed support for wiping the slate completely clean for all borrowers. Support for debt relief was, not surprisingly, higher among borrowers themselves. But when asked to choose between debt forgiveness and addressing the high cost of college, an overwhelming majority \u2014 borrowers and non-borrowers alike \u2014 said addressing the rising cost of college was most important.",

After weeks of negotiations to revive the core of their election-year agenda, Senate Democrats appear to be on the brink of passing a spending bill which would attempt to tackle climate change, the high cost of prescription drugs and lower the deficit by roughly $300 billion. Opening the Senate floor for a rare Saturday session, Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said, \"No matter how long it takes, the Senate is going to stay in session to finish this bill.\" The Senate voted along party lines to begin formal debate on the floor Saturday evening. After debate concludes, senators can introduce an unlimited number of amendments in what's known as a \"vote-a-rama.\" Also allowed during vote-a-rama is a call to have the entire text of the bill, which is roughly 700 pages, read aloud. The process is expected to stretch into Sunday before a vote on final passage. Three weeks ago, the bill was all but dead when Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., withheld his support, citing concerns about adding to historically high inflation. But just last week, he and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., announced an agreement, much to the surprise of others in the Senate. Manchin's concerns about inflation were placated by, among others, former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, a Democrat who has previously been a critic of how his party has handled inflation. Summers and other economists have argued the bill will tamp down inflation, but the Congressional Budget Office estimates that it will have negligible impact on prices in the near-term. \"This bill is a gamechanger for working families and our economy,\" Biden said at an event at the White House Friday. \"I look forward to the Senate taking up this legislation and passing it as soon as possible.\" Republicans are united against the bill, arguing that the spending in it will make inflation worse and that the health provisions will hamper pharmaceutical innovation. \"Democrats have decided their first economic disaster justifies a second economic disaster. The working people of this country feel very differently,\" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said on Saturday, but there is little his conference can do to stop the legislation. The bill is getting passed through budget reconciliation, which allows Democrats to pass the bill with a simple majority in the evenly-divided chamber and avoid the threat of a Republican filibuster that applies to most legislation. It also means each section of the bill needs to be reviewed by the Senate parliamentarian to make sure it is actually legislation that will primarily impact the budget. This review process is often referred to as the \"Byrd Bath,\" named after the late West Virginia Sen. Robert Byrd. Democrats said on Saturday that the parliamentarian approved key elements of the bill on prescription drug pricing and clean energy. One element that would compel drug companies to offer rebates if prescription prices outpaced inflation was limited in the process so that it would apply to patients on medicare but not private insurance. Still, Schumer said the bill remains mostly intact and \"can win the support of all 50 Democrats.\" Late Thursday night, Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema said she would \"move forward\" with the legislation; she was the last holdout on the bill and her support essentially means the Senate has all 50 Democratic votes needed to pass the bill. To get on board, Sinema wanted the section of the bill that narrowed the carried interest tax loophole to be removed. The measure impacts how private equity is taxed and Democrats say it would have brought in $14 billion. What Sinema wanted to add, though, brings in more revenue. It's a 1% excise tax on stock buybacks \u2014 Schumer said Friday he and progressive Democrats were excited about that aspect of the bill, which he says brings in roughly $74 billion. \"What we added excites me and I think it excites all Democrats and particularly progressives,\" Schumer said at a press conference Friday. \"I hate stock buybacks. I think they're one of the most self-serving things that corporate America does.\" Also added in is about $4 billion in drought resiliency put forward by Senators Catherine Cortez-Masto, D-Nev., Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., and Michael Bennet, D-Colo. Sinema had also called for this addition in the bill. There is still criticism of the bill coming from Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who has argued the legislation doesn't do enough for working class Americans by not increasing the minimum wage, making child care more affordable or tackling the student debt crisis. He took to the Senate floor Wednesday and called it the \"so-called\" Inflation Reduction Act. \"As currently written, this is an extremely modest piece of legislation that does virtually nothing to address the enormous crises that working families all across this country are facing today,\" he said. He added that he plans to bring up his concerns during the amendment process on the floor over the weekend, but a scenario in which Sanders' concerns prevent him from voting for the bill altogether is highly unlikely. What could be another hurdle for the bill is opposition from progressives in the House, which is set to return to consider the legislation late next week. In the past few weeks, the Senate has voted on a bill to expand health services for veterans exposed to toxic burn pits, a semiconductor bill, and a measure to allow Finland and Sweden into NATO \u2014 and all of those votes have been bipartisan. Schumer, though, has made it clear that Senate Democrats will also go it alone if they have to, which is what they're doing with this bill. No Republican will vote for the legislation, but with a tie-breaking vote from Vice President Harris, Democrats can still cinch a victory. It caps off a busy week on Capitol Hill and also sets up a busy week for the president, who already has a slew of bills to sign into law next week.",

On Sunday Shuler was elected to a four-year term as AFL-CIO president. The nation's largest labor federation made history on Sunday when Elizabeth Shuler became the first woman ever elected president of the AFL-CIO. A second barrier was also broken at the organization's convention in Philadelphia when Fred Redmond became the federation's highest-ranking Black official. He was elected secretary-treasurer, the AFL-CIO's No. 2 leadership post. President Biden, who often touts his ties to the labor movement, spoke to the convention on Tuesday, praising the work of Shuler and crediting unions with having built the American middle class and for giving working people dignity. Shuler was elected to a four-year term, but has actually been serving as AFL-CIO president since last year, following the unexpected death of her predecessor, Richard Trumka. In her speech at the convention, Shuler pledged to expand on recent organizing drives \u2014 from high tech to retail to the service industry. \"Nineteen thousand baristas at Starbucks across the country are reclaiming what it means to be a partner. And corporate and retail workers are coming together to organize at Apple,\" she said. Shuler said workers are gaining power amid labor shortages and are demanding respect after being categorized as \"essential employees\" during the pandemic. She said it's rippled through the economy. \"Museum and stadium workers, teachers and students, hotel workers and bus drivers. Capitol Hill staffers and cannabis workers. We are seeing breakthrough organizing.\" Shuler is pledging a massive grassroots organizing drive over the next decade, with a goal of adding 1 million new union members. It is a tall task, given the now-decades-long trend of declining union membership rates in the U.S. At the same time, the new AFL-CIO leadership is promising to reconnect with workers to promote support of pro-union policies and candidates in Washington, D.C., and in state legislatures and local offices around the country. Shuler said union members will be very active in this year's midterm elections, but that to yield results, the effort has to take place year round and not just in election years. Shuler and Redmond sat down with NPR just hours after their election. Here is an edited transcript of the conversation: Don Gonyea: I'd like each of you to talk about the milestone of this moment. The first woman elected to lead the largest labor organization, and the first African American elected secretary-treasurer. What does that mean both in terms of history, but also in a very practical sense? Shuler: Well, we're in a moment in the labor movement where we're excited to build on the momentum that we're seeing around us, with workers rising up and organizing all kinds of industries, all types of work. So Fred and I are just pinching ourselves because we're on the floor of this  convention with the delegates and leaders from the entire labor movement making a commitment to double down on organizing and growth. And so that's what I see is the opportunity, and now the job in this leadership position is to focus. [To Redmond] I think it was in your speech you made the point that this is where the workforce is. One that's increasingly made up of women and by persons of color. Redmond: The workforce is changing. We're going to see women as 50% of labor unions throughout this country. Millennials comprise 50% of all workers, and it's projected from eight to 10 years that people of color will be over 50% of all workers in this country. So when you look at the dynamics, the leadership that was elected today, a woman and African American, reflects the reality that the workplaces is changing. Shuler: And I think about the pandemic, and the frontline, essential workers who are disproportionately women and people of color who have gotten us through this pandemic, who suffered under tremendous burdens with regard to caring for their families, children and elderly, the disabled without that safety net. That's what the labor movement is here for. We are on the front lines of advocating for those paid sick days and making sure women are getting equal pay. So it's a perfect example of how the labor movement became more relevant than ever. How is this organization going to be different under your leadership? You are the third AFL-CIO president I've sat down with.  I remember talking to President John Sweeney at a convention like this [in 1999], and had many conversations with President Richard Trumka [who died last August]. Both talked about organizing and both worked hard at that. But here we sit with union membership at a low point. So what needs to be different? Shuler: I think what's happened in the past is the federation ran out in front, and the unions themselves were not following the plan, or that they weren't all in sync with one another. That's what's going to change as we're actually building consensus. We are building an integrated plan that everyone's all in on. [To Redmond] Did you see what President Shuler is describing as you were coming up through the ranks of your union [United Steelworkers]? Maybe too much of a top-down approach? Redmond: My leadership style and Liz's style is that we don't have all the answers, but we can identify the problems. So our leadership style is one where we will bring people together, try to pull for consensus. I think that's been missing. Shuler: We are also in a different moment in the country than our predecessors and we have stronger approval from the public. Sixty-eight percent of the public approve of unions, including 77% of young people [per Gallup]. We have this pro-union administration where the president of the United States is saying the word union, and we have workers that are fed up, they're fired up, they're rising up. So what's different in this moment is the environment we're operating in. In your acceptance speech at the convention you announced the creation of something called the \"CTO\"... Shuler: Yes, the Center for Transformational Organizing. Is that something real or just another call to action? Shuler: That's our first 100-day plan. We are committing to organizing a million new members over 10 years so that we can hold each other accountable \u2014 year after year after year \u2014 with goals that we've identified for each union. And that we're laser-focused on coming together to achieve those goals. And like I said, it'll be cross-union collaboration, resourcing and investment. And real metrics that are associated with it, because I'm with you, I want results. I don't want to have broad plans that just get announced and nobody follows up on them. So we have a real commitment with our largest unions. A goal of a million new members. To put that in perspective, you have about 12 1/2 million now, so about 8 or 9% growth? Shuler: Correct. You've seen recent organizing success, but also defeats. It's this Amazon local, but not that Amazon local. And it's just very piecemeal. Shuler: We think the federation can be a real center of gravity for organizing across the movement. The 2022 midterm elections will be critical for the union agenda \u2014 stronger worker protections, labor laws friendlier to organizing efforts. President Biden is a vocal supporter of labor, but polls indicate it could be a difficult year for Democrats. What's the plan to turn out union voters this year? Shuler: We're taking an organizing approach to our politics. We are getting back into the grassroots in a way that we haven't in a very long time, which is to center our efforts around worker to worker, person to person, face to face conversations in the workplace where you have people you trust. Not talking about candidates as much as we talk about issues. We are in such a polarized environment right now in our politics across this country. We think the labor movement can be the place where we bridge that divide. This all seems really old-fashioned. Especially when people are living in their own social media news bubbles. In fact, they like those bubbles. They get to have their views reinforced. Shuler: Everyone will tell you that the algorithms have people trapped in a kind of false bubble of misinformation, disinformation. And so the only way we break through that is through having conversations with each other, and people don't do that anymore. And the labor movement can be the place where we actually get the information out and be the trusted source, and have someone you trust that you work with day to day talk to you about issues and actually have a real conversation that might not necessarily be in sync with your Facebook page.Redmond: We lost a lot of members [with their votes] in 2016 and 2020 because members received misinformation through the news media. We feel that in these conversations, we can be a center of gravity to give people accurate information about how things in this economy are affecting them, about who's responsible \u2014 if anybody's responsible \u2014 for the price of gas, or inflation. And if we have discussions with our people you can cause them to start thinking about what's the best approach for them come November.",

That number is now down to about one in six.  Republicans are looking to a diverse group of veterans who are candidates this cycle to change those numbers, as well as control of the House of Representatives and \u2014 potentially \u2014 the face of the party. Jennifer-Ruth Green watched a polarized House chamber during the 2020 State of the Union address and thought her military background could help her make a difference. But she admitted in an interview with NPR: \"I honestly had zero idea about what running for Congress would look like.\" She was told by fellow Republicans she had no chance to win in an Indiana district that elected Democrats for more than 90 years. But she said she wants to use her platform as a Black Air Force veteran to inspire other conservatives and told NPR she views herself as a \"two-way messenger.\" \"And so, being an example is something that is a maybe secondary, tertiary effect that would cause other people to be interested and say, 'Yes, I can be a conservative and an African American and serve in politics,' \" she said. Green won the GOP primary to face freshman Democratic Rep. Frank Mrvan in November and now has money and endorsements from House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy's super PAC, the Congressional Leadership Fund. She says voters are paying attention to the war in Ukraine and the U.S. role there, but there are three top issues \u2014 the border, inflation and gas prices. Her party should focus on \"providing messaging that resonates with Hispanics and African Americans, because if we do not we will lose for generations to come because we will lose people who are interested in hearing what we have to say,\" Green told NPR. Jen Kiggans, a state senator in Virginia, is one of four Republican candidates with military backgrounds competing in a district that contains military installations around Norfolk and Virginia Beach. Kiggans decided to run after seeing female Democratic veterans win House seats in 2018, including a former member of her squadron, Rep. Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey, and Rep. Elaine Luria, a former Navy commander, whom she is challenging. \"I thought, well, where are the Republican women? Because we differ in our opinions on many issues,\" she said. \"And as a conservative I felt like, where are the Republican veteran women?\" Kiggans decided to run for state Senate in 2020. Her party fielded roughly 260 veterans for the House that year, following the success of Democratic candidates with national security backgrounds flipping red seats in 2018. Luria told NPR that the group in that midterm cycle \"organically\" approached running for office and it was less of an organized strategy. According to Michael McAdams, spokesman for the House GOP's campaign committee, for the 2022 cycle 251 Republican veterans filed to run in House districts. Virginia state Sen.

Jen Kiggans, left, talks with Sen. Mark Obenshain during a Senate session at the Science Museum in Richmond, Va., in February 2021. Division and gridlock motivated Kiggans to stop yelling at the national news from her couch and run for a House seat, Kiggans told NPR. Basically, she didn't feel like she was represented. Altogether, she feels her party could do a better job and recruiting and supporting female veterans. \"It's hard to run,\" she said. \"It's hard to run especially as a female when you're a mom and working mom, and so we do need that support.\" Kiggans says the economy is her top issue but in her district, with the highest veteran population in the state,  she's also talking about the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan and what went wrong. Jeremy Hunt is a West Point graduate who served in army intelligence. After five years in the military, including a deployment to Ukraine, he said the political environment made it a good time for a Republican to launch a political career. \"We felt specifically, for this seat, we knew that it's either now or never,\" he said. \"If we're going to make a difference ... it's a year like 2022 where a lot of people are just suffering under Biden's economy with inflation, gas prices, you name it.\" He said his approach to learning on the job from experts with military experience is how he approaches understanding voters, mostly farmers, in his district. \"I'm not showing up saying, 'Here's what Washington can do for you, and here's my 10-point plan,' \" he said. \"What I'm doing is I'm showing up and I'm listening and saying, 'Look, you've been doing this much longer than I have, tell me what what can we do to support you.' \" Hunt cites rising energy prices, concerns about illegal immigration and drugs coming across the border as what he hears about the most. When it comes to former President Donald Trump, who is still relitigating the 2020 election in Georgia, Hunt is clear in separating himself from that message. \"We are trying to build a serious coalition to flip a key Democrat seat, we don't spend much time talking about national level stuff,\" he said. Green praised Trump's policies, which she argued boosted the economy during his term, but contrasted her style. \"I want to make sure that I lead with accountability and with integrity, and my style of leadership is vastly different from his,\" she said. \"And I want to lead in a different way.\" Kiggans pivoted from questions about the former president, noting he's not on the ballot this year and saying \"nothing will matter if we don't flip the U.S. House, in my opinion.\" So far Trump isn't weighing in these swing district races. Hunt, who is an African American, is running against a Black Democrat who also served briefly in the Army, Sanford Bishop. Hunt says his party needs to reach out beyond its base. \"I think the future is going to be in districts like mine, building a multiracial working class coalition of voters and, specifically in a lot of our rural communities, standing up for our farmers,\" he said. \"The future of the conservative movement that is going to be building a broader coalition of folks.\" After the 2018 midterms saw an influx of veterans elected to the House a bipartisan group created the For Country Caucus to work across the aisle on issues related to veterans and national security. Florida Republican Michael Waltz, a former Army Green Beret, pointed to the dynamic in the group. \"We disagree on all kinds of issues, but it's that ethos that's missing \u2014 that we were willing to die for the flag at a very early age \u2014 I think we can roll up our sleeves, take tough votes, take tough compromises to move the country forward,\" he said. Luria pointed out that she has broken with her party on the size of the defense budget and cited her work on military family and veterans issues in the bipartisan group. \"The fact that we have that common background as veterans \u2014 we really value working together on those types of issues,\" she said. Republican and Democratic candidates this cycle agree that polarization on Capitol Hill is only getting worse. The results of the 2002 midterms could test whether boosting the number of veterans in the House will actually change the tenor in the institution, even just for a narrow set of issues.",

            "article_content": "President Emmanuel Macron has won reelection, beating Marine Le Pen, his far-right rival, in a presidential election runoff.  MICHEL MARTIN, HOST: President Emmanuel Macron has won the French presidential election tonight with an estimated 58% of the vote. That's higher than expected but a slimmer margin than the last time he faced off against Marine Le Pen and her far-right party. We're going to go now to NPR's Eleanor Beardsley in Paris, who's been following events and was at Macron's victory celebration. Eleanor, thanks so much for being here. ELEANOR BEARDSLEY, BYLINE: Great to be with you, Michel. MARTIN: As we said that these results are better than had been predicted for Macron. What's the mood there in Paris? BEARDSLEY: Well, I would say joy and relief. You know, they have this funny tradition here in France that they announce the winner on the nightly news at exactly 8:00. And there's this countdown, and then the winner's face pops up on the TV screen. So I was under the Eiffel Tower where Macron supporters and his campaign were, and there were giant TV screens everywhere, people waving flags - thousands of people - and everyone just kind of counted down together. And let me let you hear some of that sound. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE: (Speaking French). (CHEERING) BEARDSLEY: So then everyone just exploded in joy as Macron's face popped up, you know, with 58.2% next to it, compared with Le Pen's roughly 42%. People were happy but also very relieved because this was a hard-fought race, and Marine Le Pen brought her far-right party closer than it's ever been to taking power. MARTIN: Yes. And as you were telling us, the margin is slimmer than the last time he beat her five years ago with 10 more points. I mean, that was 66% of the vote. What's changed? BEARDSLEY: Well, you know, this year there wasn't as much enthusiasm for him. He wasn't this new maverick politician anymore. He has many detractors. Working-class and left-wing voters feel particularly betrayed by him. And she's changed her image. She's moderated her tone. She's drawn new crowds. Here she is in her concession speech tonight. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) MARINE LE PEN: (Speaking French). BEARDSLEY: She called it a stunning victory because her party actually got more than 42% of the vote. And it is huge for her. The populist right has never been so popular. And many people who voted for Macron today actually voted against her to try to block her. And his supporters know that. MARTIN: So does this suggest that Macron will have to change? I mean, how is he going to govern this time around? BEARDSLEY: Yeah. I mean, he's been accused of being just arrogant and aloof and just like a king, you know? And analysts say his mandate and his legitimacy are a lot weaker this time around. And he's going to have to govern differently in consultation, you know, not alone from high up. He's going to have to compromise. And, you know, many analysts say he's not really good at that. Macron came on stage tonight under the Eiffel Tower, and here he is speaking to the crowd. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: (Speaking French). BEARDSLEY: So he acknowledged. He said, I know that many of you here tonight did not vote for me and my ideas, but you just did it to block the far right. So I think he knows that things are different this time around, and people are hoping that he might be a little more humble. So we'll see. MARTIN: That was NPR's Eleanor Beardsley from Paris. Eleanor, thank you so much. BEARDSLEY: Thank you, Michel. Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "Mexico's president has set a recall election for Sunday on his own term in office. He's expected to win what critics say is an act of political theater.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: A recall election is usually launched by someone who wants to get a person out of office. But in this case, in Mexico, the recall election was the president's own idea. On Sunday, Mexicans decide the fate of President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador. Here's NPR's Carrie Kahn. CARRIE KAHN, BYLINE: Eighteen-year-old Andrea Cabrera (ph) and her mom are enjoying an ice cream on this recent day in a working-class neighborhood near Mexico City's airport. Above their head is a huge banner in support of President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador. ANDREA CABRERA: (Speaking Spanish). KAHN: \"I'm his fan 100%,\" says Cabrera. Her pink T-shirt sports a cartoon likeness of Lopez Obrador with gray hair and a bucktoothed smile. She's voting Sunday for him to finish out his term till 2024. CABRERA: (Speaking Spanish). KAHN: \"The president has given a lot of support to both me and my mom,\" she says. She gets financial aid for high school. Her mother, Fabiola Rivera (ph), receives a small stipend for single mothers. FABIOLA RIVERA: (Speaking Spanish). KAHN: \"He has shown how he helps all Mexicans,\" she says. Lopez Obrador swept into office in 2018, pledging to put the poor first and crack down on Mexico's endemic corruption. He also said he would hold a recall vote. As he explained last December at a State of the Union address, such votes ensure the people are in charge... (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT ANDRES MANUEL LOPEZ OBRADOR: (Speaking Spanish). (CHEERING) KAHN: ...And can get rid of greedy, bad leaders, he said to thunderous applause. Polls show Mexicans want to keep him in power. Lopez Obrador is popular, and his opposition is weak. But Carlos Bravo Regidor, an analyst at the research center CIDE in Mexico City says inflation, the country's staggering violence and several political scandals have chipped away at the president's high marks. CARLOS BRAVO REGIDOR: This is a way for him to say, I'm still strong; in spite of all, people support me. KAHN: Critics charge that the recall is a waste of money. The president, usually known for his fiscal austerity, allocated $77 million for the vote. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE: (Chanting in Spanish). KAHN: Last Sunday, his opponents rallied in cities around the country, but turnout like this one in the capital was small. Shouting, finish and get out, ralliers like 62-year-old retiree Dalia Reyes (ph) says she won't participate in a farce. DALIA REYES: (Speaking Spanish). KAHN: \"It's a trap, a way for him to feel glorious, like he's the emperor of Mexico,\" she says. In the recall, not only is a no vote needed to oust him, but it requires a 40% turnout to be binding. Neither is expected. Critics say the president is using this recall vote to build momentum in the second half of his term and to step up attacks on the federal elections institute, known as INE, which runs national elections. He's long maintained it stole a previous election from him. Luis Ugalde, a former director of INE, says Lopez Obrador is moving to strip Mexico's few functioning institutions of their independence. LUIS UGALDE: Our very young democracy with a lot of deficiencies (ph) is going to collapse. That is what is at stake at this moment in Mexico. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE: (Chanting in Spanish). CLAUDIA SHEINBAUM: (Speaking Spanish). KAHN: Defying rules on campaigning by public officials, Mexico City's mayor addressed thousands Wednesday in support of Lopez Obrador. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) SHEINBAUM: (Speaking Spanish). KAHN: Mayor Claudia Sheinbaum, star of the ruling party, riled up the city's supporters. She's the president's most likely pick to be his successor in 2024. Carrie Kahn, NPR News, Mexico City.

            "article_content": "Democrats hope to benefit from rising support for unions \u2014 even as they face a brutal path to maintaining control of Congress in this fall's midterm elections.  LEILA FADEL, HOST: Over the past few years, Democrats appear to have lost support from working-class voters. Unions offer a chance to change that. High-profile attempts to unionize places like Amazon and Starbucks have workers fired up. And as Stephan Bisaha of the Gulf States Newsroom reports, that's giving Democrats a chance to reach the midterm voters they desperately need. STEPHAN BISAHA, BYLINE: On paper, it would seem Democrats would not have a shot at winning over Rily Hughlett. He's an Alabama coal miner who votes to protect the Second Amendment, opposes abortion and keeps Fox News muted in the background. But he's also a union man who's been on strike for the past year, manning the picket line and attending weekly rallies. And at one of those rallies, lunch was paid for by Senator Bernie Sanders. RILY HUGHLETT: Yeah, he did. He did. Bernie Sanders, imagine that. BISAHA: Hughlett's giving some begrudging respect to Sanders for not just paying for lunch, but raising $30,000 for the United Mine Workers of America's strike fund. That's been an essential part of keeping striking miners ahead of their bills. HUGHLETT: You know, the man stepped up. I'm shocked. But at least it points that he's a decent person. BISAHA: I met coal miner Jeffrey Fleenor (ph) at a rally in Brookwood, Ala. He was also impressed Sanders picked up the lunch tab. JEFFREY FLEENOR: I believe it was Jim 'N Nick's Bar-B-Q. I appreciate that. BISAHA: Fleenor does not see eye to eye politically with Democrats on everything, but he says he doesn't need to to share common ground. FLEENOR: You know, I think that's what we're lacking in America. You know, we've let somebody's politics get too divisive that we need to come back in the middle and try to find common ground again. BISAHA: And when it comes to common ground, unions are a pretty good option. Yes, union membership is tied for an all-time low in this country. But approval for unions is at its highest point since 1965, according to Gallup. Big companies like Kellogg's were hit by strikes last year, and organizing campaigns picked up at companies like Amazon and Starbucks. All this gives Democrats a chance to attract not just union members, but voters excited over labor issues, voters Democrats are losing on everything else from inflation to crime. But Sanders' union outreach has not been the norm for Democrats, according to Dorian Warren with the left-leaning Economic Security Project. DORIAN WARREN: It is mind-boggling to me why this wouldn't be a fundamental and core priority of Democratic Party leadership. BISAHA: The party had pushed the PRO Act, which would make unionizing easier. But it's both stalled and taken a backseat to other bills. Democrats have also had their standing as the party for the working class taken over by Donald Trump. The former president's blue collar appeal turned blue states, like Michigan and Wisconsin, purple. Striking Alabama coal miner Matthew Wright (ph) says Trump's good for workers. MATTHEW WRIGHT: Very good for workers. He keep you working - because the Democrats, they don't want you to work. They want you to stay home and draw a little, bitty check, where they can control you. Not me. BISAHA: Yet Republicans have also been reluctant to side with unions. Alabama Senator Tommy Tuberville denounced a Democrat-led Senate hearing looking at Alabama's coal miners' strike. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TOMMY TUBERVILLE: This hearing is what I call the dream Democrat political parlay, where members can be pro-union, anti-Wall Street and anti-mining production all in one hearing. HUGHLETT: Well, I won't be voting for him no more. BISAHA: That's Rily Hughlett again, one of the striking miners. He was not happy when he heard Tuberville defended Warrior Met Coal, the company Hughlett's striking against. HUGHLETT: He sucks (laughter). If you - you're either for the people or you're not. Some people, they talk out of two sides of their face. BISAHA: Tuberville may have lost Hughlett, but Hughlett says Democrats have to do a little more work to earn his vote.

It is the behemoth company's first U.S. union, and was born on Friday after a dramatic and unexpected victory over Amazon by a ragtag grassroots movement. At the heart of the campaign is Smalls who was fired from his job at the Amazon warehouse on Staten Island at the beginning of the pandemic in 2020 \u2014 the same day he had organized a walkout over safety conditions. His co-star in the organizing drive is his friend Derrick Palmer, who currently works at the warehouse. Together, they will lead a union representing some 8,300 workers who work at the same warehouse. In a conversation with NPR on Twitter Spaces, Palmer and Smalls spoke about their underdog journey and the response from workers all over the country. Here are highlights and edited excerpts from the event. Smalls: I'll read you one email I got last night from a woman. I'm not going to say the building name yet, but in Sacramento, California, basically a 24-year-old woman emailed me last night and told me. She said...'You guys lit a fire under me. I want to unionize my building.' We've been getting emails like that, you know, of course they're congratulating us, but most of them are saying: You guys motivated me. I want to unionize. How do I get involved? How do I start a new chapter? So we have been contacted from over 50 buildings ... I'm talking about 50 different buildings all over this country and not just this country, even overseas in South Africa, India. Canada has reached out to us, the UK. So the world is definitely paying attention now and these workers are paying attention now, which is the best thing possible because that's exactly what we plan on doing. Just like the Starbucks movement, we want to spread like wildfire across the nation. A worker and organizer, who identified himself as Ryan with the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades was in attendance at the Twitter Spaces event and called the union's victory over Amazon \"a watershed moment.\" He asked: \"What message do you have for the millions of workers across the country who want to organize right now or, you know, who want to be in a union, but either can't or haven't had the opportunity, what would you say to them, what can they do?\" Smalls: If I can lead us to victory over Amazon, what's stopping anybody in this country from organizing their workplace? Nothing. You know, people got to get out of that mentality of, Oh, let me just quit my job. Because when you quit your job, guess what? They hire somebody else. So you're jumping from one fire into the next, and the system doesn't get fixed by doing that. Chris Smalls, president of the Amazon Labor Union, pauses while walking with supporters as they march at the Amazon distribution center in the Staten Island borough of New York on Oct. 25, 2021.\n                \n                    \n                    Craig Ruttle/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Chris Smalls, president of the Amazon Labor Union, pauses while walking with supporters as they march at the Amazon distribution center in the Staten Island borough of New York on Oct. 25, 2021. So we, as workers, the working class, we got to realize our value. If we don't go to work, these CEOs don't make their money. So if workers can realize that no matter where you work in this country, what you're doing, then you will realize that you can form something that can collectively bargain. That's what I think we witnessed on April 1st \u2014 we were able to share this experience with the world and let everybody know that any ordinary person can take down the most powerful company or retailer, or whatever, no matter how big or small. Smalls: We didn't have no plan. We had no playbook. We just knew that we were doing something. We knew what we wanted to do ... But you're talking about a handful of people. We're talking about four people that started this all. Two tables, two chairs in the tent. And that was it. We started signing people up. We just say, You know what? We're going to sign people up for this union and see where it goes. Palmer: We actually went down to Alabama and we noticed a few things about how they ran a campaign. First of all, you know, they're an established union with a limited amount of Amazon workers that are actually organizing. So we feel like they didn't really have that one-on-one connection with the workers. And I feel like that's vital to a union campaign, that you need to talk to these workers, you need to really understand their pain and what they're going through. So we felt like there was a lot of missed opportunities \u2014 just them, like not really communicating with the workers as much as we thought they should. Just because you have an election coming up doesn't mean they're going to actually win. You have to still engage with them on a consistent basis. So that made us feel like, you know, they were kind of like out of touch. So, you know, when we took our organization efforts on, we just decided that, you know, Amazon workers need to organize other Amazon workers...we knew we had to have an unorthodox approach. Smalls: Amazon's been around for 28 years. You know, that's it. These established unions had 28 years to try. We did it in 11 months. Smalls: We were just living our normal lives, going to work every day, just going home, watching sports. We had no intentions of doing any of this. And that is the god-honest truth. Palmer: You know, we were just regular guys with regular lives, partying, going to work and coming home...doing what normal 30-year-olds do. Amazon pretty much motivated us to get to where we are now. And you know, who knows if Amazon would have treated us right? Instead of listening to our concerns, you know, during the pandemic, they decided to take their own stance. And ultimately, I feel like they paid the price...So it backfired on them. Everything they tried to do to silence me, silence Chris and all the organizers, it worked against them.",

He's aiming to win over working-class voters that Trump himself relied on.  TAMARA KEITH, HOST: There's a key Senate race in Ohio this year. The GOP field is crowded with candidates in the mold of former President Trump. On the Democratic side, the leading candidate is Congressman Tim Ryan, who's aiming to win over working-class voters that Trump himself relied on. But Ryan faces an uphill battle in a state that's become more Republican. NPR's Don Gonyea reports. DON GONYEA, BYLINE: It's 9 in the morning, 22 degrees. I'm following Congressman Tim Ryan. He's got a busy day ahead - five stops. The first one here, just outside Columbus, is at the Carpenters Union Hall. Let's go inside.

That's because Joe Burrow, who played high school ball about an hour from here, is the quarterback for the Super Bowl-bound Cincinnati Bengals. TIM RYAN: Long way to go. The thing about him, though - he can get sacked five times, and he's still standing. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: He can still win a game. Jesus. RYAN: It's unbelievable. Where are you guys working? UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: I'm out there at Facebook. GONYEA: The talk goes back and forth, football and jobs. RYAN: Well, I'll let you guys get back - appreciate it. You guys take care. Thank you. GONYEA: Thirty-three-year-old carpenter Jamel Kendrick was in the group. He admits he doesn't know much about Ryan. JAMEL KENDRICK: We're getting plenty of work. I just want to make sure that the work just stays. Columbus is doing a lot of growing right now. Maybe with Mr. - I'm sorry. What was his name? GONYEA: Ryan. KENDRICK: Mr. Ryan. Hopefully, he can go ahead and push some of that things (ph) forward and keep us working and, you know, keep us happy. GONYEA: Kendrick is an independent voter. He backed Joe Biden but says he did consider voting Trump for economic reasons. It's voters like this that Ryan needs, and it's why he spends so much time talking about jobs. Ryan travels in a maroon GMC pickup truck with a few aides. Next stop is a company that makes clay roof tiles, then to the river town of McConnelsville for a small meet-and-greet and late lunch at the Chatterbox Tavern. RYAN: This is a mushroom burger with hot peppers on it. Well, they're not hot. They're banana peppers. Mushroom, provolone - oh, my. GONYEA: There was talk here of how stretched basic city services are and how getting broadband would give this town a boost. Next, another 60-mile trek to the city of Marietta and the offices of the local Democratic Party. It was packed as Ryan spoke. RYAN: And we've had a lot of economic policy decisions that have been made for the last 30 or 40 years that have wrecked the middle class - the trade deals, the outsourcing, then automation, all of these things. And nobody cared. Nobody cared. GONYEA: And he said politicians of both parties were to blame. A union equipment operator named Heath Stevens was in the back nodding in agreement. A Democrat, he said he wished his Republican coworkers would hear what Ryan's got to say. It's frustrating, he says. HEATH STEVENS: It's hard for me to see why some people wouldn't vote for him. But, you know, some guys I work with will never hear his name and will never get to hear him talk to a crowd. GONYEA: Ryan said that's why he's in places where Democrats don't usually go. There is a template for the kind of jobs-focused campaign Ryan is running. Three-term Senator Sherrod Brown is a Democrat who's found continued success in Ohio even as the state turns more red. RYAN: Sherrod Brown is an economic Ohio Democrat, and so am I. GONYEA: Ryan stresses he's ready to pick fights with anyone, even Democrats. There is evidence in his longshot bid to challenge Nancy Pelosi as House Democratic leader back in 2016. He also makes it clear that despite his strong support for President Biden's economic agenda, he won't be seeking Biden's help campaigning. RYAN: I don't need proxies. I don't need anyone to help me. I don't need, you know, someone to come campaign for me. I can handle this myself. GONYEA: The next morning, Ryan walked into a coffee shop on the Ohio River in Meigs County. The center tables were already filled with local citizens, all Democrats in a county Trump carried 3 to 1. The talk was familiar. RYAN: It always gets back to broadband infrastructure, skills, education, you know? GONYEA: Ryan has a long chat with a woman seated over in the corner. Her name is Lynsi McKinney, a stay-at-home mom with three kids. She told me they talked about the economy, and she liked what she heard. She says she's a Republican, but... LYNSI MCKINNEY: I am going to vote for whoever I believe is going to do right by my family and my friends. GONYEA: She did vote for Donald Trump, but she says she does not like Trump's obsession with the 2020 result, nor does she believe the election was stolen. MCKINNEY: Going back and counting the votes, I think that everybody did their best to make sure that it was fair and all of the votes were counted correctly. So I don't know. GONYEA: But she still likes Trump, and if he endorses one of the Republicans running for Senate in Ohio, that would be a plus for her. It's a reminder of how big a task Tim Ryan has in trying to win votes in these Trump strongholds. Don Gonyea, NPR News. (SOUNDBITE OF JELLIS AND SUBSETS' \"KYOTO\") Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.

A fruit vendor, angry after police harassed him and confiscated his street cart and produce, set himself on fire in the middle of traffic just in front of the governor's office. Mohamed Bouazizi's despair resonated and triggered a revolution that led to the overthrow of an autocrat. As the story goes, before he doused himself in gasoline he asked \"how do you expect me to make a living?\" Twelve years later, rights groups say the only budding democracy that emerged from the 2011 Arab revolutions is now at risk of returning to autocracy under  Tunisia's President Kais Saied. He's been consolidating power and arresting political opponents. The parliamentary election appears to be one more step toward cementing that regression. Waseem Jday, 31, walks through his neighborhood on the outskirts of Sidi Bouzid, Tunisia. He's been unemployed for over a decade.\n                \n                    \n                    Claire Harbage/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Waseem Jday, 31, walks through his neighborhood on the outskirts of Sidi Bouzid, Tunisia. He's been unemployed for over a decade. It's why Wasseem Jday is boycotting today's vote, timed to the anniversary of Bouazizi's self-immolation. \"We cannot talk about democracy anymore after what happened on July 25th,\" he said. He references the date the president dissolved the elected parliament last year and took the powers for himself. Today the president rules by decree. Dressed in a T-shirt and black blazer, Jday walks through the middle class neighborhood where he grew up on the outskirts of Sidi Bouzid. He points out his childhood home-turned-kindergarten across the street from an unfinished building with a wedding dress shop on the bottom floor. Then he heads down the block to his sister's house. At 31, like the people he helps as the head of the local unemployment association, he can't afford his own place. So he splits his time between his sister's home and his parents'. We lost hope. We lost expecting things. There's nothing on the horizon. \"I don't want to say that the situation was better before, but the reality is that the situation has gotten much worse, especially for the youth and I am one of them,\" Jday. \"We lost hope. We lost expecting things. There's nothing on the horizon.\" Wasseem Jday, 31, is unemployed and splits his time between his sister's home and his parents'.\n                \n                    \n                    Claire Harbage/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Since he graduated with a degree in sports education 11 years ago, he's been unemployed like more than 18% of people in his province. That number has been creeping up every year across the country. Jday takes odd jobs in agriculture or construction. About half of Tunisia's population works in the informal economy, mostly the young, without benefits or worker protections. Not having a job has stalled his life. Jday thought he'd have kids and a wife at this age. \"To get married, you need a fixed income,\" he said. \"You need a house. You need to be capable of spending on your family. There's none of this.\" The promise of work and development from the revolution never came to be. Jday blames years of political infighting and paralysis among Tunisia's many parties. It's why, when Saied first got rid of the parliament, Jday was filled with a mixture of happiness and fear. \"Fear because we didn't know where we were going,\" Jday said. And happiness \"because of this change.\" People participate in a protest against President Kais Saied last week.\n                \n                    \n                    Claire Harbage/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption People participate in a protest against President Kais Saied last week. The country had seen ten major government changes since the revolution, dealt with one political crisis after the next as the government failed to reform an economic system built on corruption and cronyism. Then the pandemic came and deepened Tunisia's economic crisis. But when Saied started arresting his political opponents and suspended the post-revolutionary constitution, Jday realized something was wrong. The biggest victory of the revolution was the new constitution, he said. An elected assembly wrote it after years of public discussion to establish checks and balances and protect human rights. Earlier this year, Saied replaced it with a new constitution he put together and put to a referendum. It passed by a landslide, but turnout was low. Bouazizi's grave (center bottom) is a simple resting place nestled in a small cemetery outside his family village. The epitaph reads \"Martyr.\"\n                \n                    \n                    Claire Harbage/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Bouazizi's grave (center bottom) is a simple resting place nestled in a small cemetery outside his family village. The epitaph reads \"Martyr.\" \"There was a deception, a big deception,\" Jday said. \"We understood then that we were going into a dictatorship and into one man rule in this country, one man with all the power. We have a fear of losing the liberty and freedom that was our only gain since 2011.\" Today, exactly 12 years after Jday protested for work, dignity and freedom in the birth city of Tunisia's revolution, I ask if he'd gotten those demands. Work? \"No.\" Freedom? He hesitates for a moment trying to decide. Then answers. \"No.\" Dignity? \"No.\" Jday's inability to find work has stalled his life.\n                \n                    \n                    Claire Harbage/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Jday's older brother, Yassin, is voting.

But I disagree with him,\" Yassin said. \"The 25th of July opened new horizons and gave us hope. If we lose hope, we lose the coming generations. We lose those who are now migrating illegally. We lose those who are unemployed and have been fighting to find a job for years. We lose everything.\" \"People just need to be patient,\" Yassin said. \"Give the president some time. Vote in a new parliament.\" Yassin Jday is voting and participating in the electoral process.\n                \n                    \n                    Claire Harbage/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Yassin Jday is voting and participating in the electoral process. In central Sidi Bouzid, the street where Bouazizi set himself on fire, is a shrine to his legacy. His portrait covers the building that houses the post office. A giant beige replica of the cart taken from him is now erected in the traffic circle called Martyr's Square. In big, black letters, graffiti spells out the date that Bouazizi set himself on fire: December 17, 2010. There's also another date, October 13th, 2019, with the words \"The People Want.\" It shows just how popular Saied was when he ran as a political outsider on an anti-corruption platform. Mohamed Bouazizi's portrait covers the building that houses the post office in Sidi Bouzid.\n                \n                    \n                    Claire Harbage/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Mohamed Bouazizi's portrait covers the building that houses the post office in Sidi Bouzid. Today he rules alone. Saied claims what he's doing is \"correcting the course of the revolution.\" He's said he's trying to pull the country out of its economic crisis and has no aspirations of a dictator. But every step he's taken erodes checks and balances on his power and suppresses critics. Some of his political opponents are being prosecuted in military court. Meanwhile, the economic pain in Tunisia has only grown in the midst of the political instability and a global economic downturn.  People can't find basic goods like milk, inflation is soaring and the country is on the verge of economic collapse. \"If I had the president or his prime minister in front of me, I would ask them a very simple question,\" said Selim Kharrat, the head of the Tunisian watchdog group Al Bawsala. \"You had two years without any kind of opposition. You are alone to take any kind of decision you want. You did a lot of steps. You did adopt a lot of new laws. What are the results? What is the outcome?\" \"Nothing.\" People wave flags and chant at a protest against President Kais Saied last week.\n                \n                    \n                    Claire Harbage/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption People wave flags and chant at a protest against President Kais Saied last week. The only real change Tunisians have seen, Kharrat said, is the chipping away of freedom of speech and other liberties. \"Tunisia is on the way to autocracy,\" he said. \"The legislative elections is one of the last steps of this process that the president implemented by himself.\" Across the country it's clear a malaise has set in, especially among the young. People are giving up on the political process altogether because life just keeps getting harder. In central Sidi Bouzid, down the street from where the revolution started, two young men sip coffee and smoke cigarettes. Both are unemployed. They sit around most days, with no vision of a future. Their plan not to vote isn't a political statement. They just don't see the point. Wajdi Naji describes his daily reality in one repeated sentence. \"We wake up, we smoke, we get drunk, we sleep,\" he said.

            "article_content": "150 years ago, Victoria Woodhull became the first woman in American history to run for president, at a time when most women couldn't even vote.  AILSA CHANG, HOST: One hundred fifty years ago, Victoria Woodhull did something no woman had done before. Woodhull was a clairvoyant, a businesswoman, an advocate of sexual freedom and a magnet for media attention and scandal. And in the election of 1872, almost 50 years before women would get the right to vote, Woodhull became the first woman in U.S. history to run for president. Radio Diaries brings us the story. SCOTT CLAFLIN: My name is Scott Claflin, and I am a descendant of Victoria Claflin Woodhull. The first time I began to become aware of my relative was in 1964, when the Republican Senator Margaret Chase Smith was running for president of the United States. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: Senator Smith posing now for the photographers, wearing her traditional rose, looking very happy and very pleased about the whole thing. CLAFLIN: They were talking about history being made with Margaret Chase Smith being the first woman to run for president. We're watching, and my dad said, that's not right. These guys don't know what they're talking about. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) AMANDA FRISKEN: My name is Amanda Frisken, and I wrote the book \"Victoria Woodhull's Sexual Revolution.\" Woodhull came from an unusual family, the Claflins. She grew up in a small town in Ohio, but they moved a lot, kind of traveling salesman, catch-as-catch-can. And at the age of 14, Woodhull was married off by her parents to a man who proved to be an alcoholic. And she had a pretty hard life with him. She was traveling around when she said she had a revelation to go out there and declare her right to be a woman in public and to be a powerful woman. And so she packed up and came to New York. CLAFLIN: This was an era where a woman could not vote, could not enter a restaurant, a store, an establishment of any kind unless she was escorted by a man. It was controversial for women to do anything, but she had the foresight not to accept the way society was. FRISKEN: She started a radical newspaper. She opened the first woman stock brokerage firm. But the thing that gave her national fame was when she sent a card to the New York Herald declaring her candidacy for the presidency. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: (Reading) Letter to the New York Herald, April 2, 1871 - I claim the right to speak for the unenfranchised woman of the country and announce myself as a candidate for the presidency. FRISKEN: For a woman at that moment to be running for president when most women in the country couldn't even cast a ballot made this a pretty extreme act. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) UNIDENTIFIED MUSICAL ARTIST: (Singing) If the men should see the women going to the polls... FRISKEN: In the 19th century, lots of women were making claims about women's rights. You might think that women suffragists turned to Woodhull, and some of them did. But the suffragists in the 1870s tended to be middle-class to upper-middle-class women, more conventional, more serious. Woodhull was really an outsider - not well-educated, rather uncouth. And some of them just thought she was insane. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) UNIDENTIFIED MUSICAL ARTIST: (Singing) Though all the men should frown on us when going to the polls. FRISKEN: The thing that really made Woodhull notorious was when she gave a speech in New York City on November 20, 1871, entitled \"The Principles Of Social Freedom.\" In that speech, she claimed marriage was a form of tyranny for women. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: (Reading) It is high time that your sisters and daughters should no longer be led to the altar like sheep to the shambles. The sexual relation must be rescued from this insidious form of slavery. I protest... CLAFLIN: She was speaking, and a woman yelled out and said, do you believe in free love? And she said, yes, I believe in free love. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: (Reading) Yes, I am a free lover. I have an inalienable, constitutional and natural right to love whom I may, to change that love every day if I please. And neither you nor any law you can frame have any right to interfere. FRISKEN: She was really just making a rhetorical point in the middle of a much more complicated speech. But that's the one that everyone put in the paper. It became known as her free love speech. It gave her instant national fame but not necessarily the kind that she had hoped for. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) CLAFLIN: 1872, she was nominated by the Equal Rights Party at a convention in New York City. FRISKEN: It was very easy for the press to lampoon this. They thought it was ridiculous. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: About 800 members of the Woodhull wing assembled yesterday morning at Apollo Hall. The exercises were opened by the singing of \"Hail, Columbia,\" after which a frivolous and tedious discussion on irrelevant topics arose. FRISKEN: The Equal Rights Party advocated women's rights to fair wages in the workplace, shorter workdays, and they also advocated civil rights for freed men and women. And when the discussion over the vice presidency came up, they nominated probably the most well-known African American man at the time, Frederick Douglass. But they didn't ask him first, and he never accepted the nomination. He felt that it was probably wiser not to dignify the nomination with a response. The convention was really the high point for Woodhull. And after that, things really went downhill for her. As a result of the notoriety of the nomination, Woodhull was evicted from her home, and she had some trouble making ends meet. She then lashed out at a former ally, Henry Ward Beecher, who was a very prominent minister, saying that he wouldn't support the free love cause he wouldn't support social freedom publicly, that he was a coward for not doing that because everyone knows Beecher is privately practicing free love, that he had dozens of mistresses. And she then decided to publish the story. That didn't help her situation. It made it a lot worse. CLAFLIN: She was arrested for sending obscenities through the mail under laws that no longer exist, the Comstock Laws. And on Election Day, she sat in jail. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) FRISKEN: Woodhull wasn't on the ballot anywhere on the election of 1872. So in terms of actual voting numbers, we have no record that anyone voted for Woodhull. She was a woman who has a terrible reputation, who may have at least temporarily done the cause more harm than good. But she's the first woman to put her name out there and say, I want to run for president. It makes for a very complicated founding narrative for women. You want someone really beyond reproach. You want the George Washington for women. And you don't get that with Woodhull. She was a flawed first, but she's still the first. I mean, she's the one we have to live with.

            "article_content": "In January, President Biden visited Pittsburgh, Pa., hours before a bridge collapsed. He returned to that bridge for the midterms to tout his economic blueprint.  AILSA CHANG, HOST: President Biden traveled to Pennsylvania today, a state that could decide whether Democrats keep control of the Senate after the midterm elections. He went to look at a bridge that dramatically collapsed nine months ago and to talk about how things are getting fixed. NPR's Barbara Sprunt reports. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Hello, Pittsburgh. BARBARA SPRUNT, BYLINE: This is the second time Biden has visited Fern Hollow Bridge in Pittsburgh's East End. Back in January, he was on his way to the city when the bridge suddenly made headlines. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BIDEN: On a snowy day, the bridge behind me collapsed 100 feet straight down to Fern Hollow, and five cars and a bus were crossing the bridge at the time. SPRUNT: Biden made a detour that day to check it out. He said it was lucky that no one died. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BIDEN: But it never should have come to this. For too long, we talked about building the best economy in the world and the best infrastructure in the world. SPRUNT: With less than three weeks until the midterm elections, the bridge was a symbolic backdrop for Biden to highlight his administration's investments - more than a trillion dollars to fix bridges, roads, seaports and lead pipes. It's one of the biggest accomplishments from his first two years as president. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BIDEN: We're finally getting to it. We're getting it done. SPRUNT: Biden wasn't just highlighting money for bridges. He was also there to support his party's candidate in a tight Senate race, Lieutenant Governor John Fetterman, who attended the event. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BIDEN: This is law about more than rebuilding infrastructure. It's about rebuilding the middle class, something John knows a lot about and talks a lot about. SPRUNT: The economy and inflation are top issues for voters in Pennsylvania and around the country, so Biden has been talking about his infrastructure law a lot as he campaigns. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BIDEN: Instead of infrastructure week, which was a punch line for four years under my predecessor, it's infrastructure decade, a headline on my watch. SPRUNT: Although the infrastructure law did not directly fund this bridge repair, the White House says its funding allowed Pennsylvania's Department of Transportation to move money quickly to rebuild the bridge without having to slow down other projects. Greg Stahl, a carpenter who's working on the bridge, says it's bringing a lot of jobs. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) GREG STAHL: This investment is putting thousands and thousands of my union brothers and sisters to work from coast to coast. SPRUNT: After the event, Biden picked up a sandwich from a famous local shop and then was off to Philadelphia to help raise money for Fetterman, who's running for an open Senate seat against TV doctor Mehmet Oz, the Republican who was endorsed by former President Donald Trump. And Biden has another trip to Pennsylvania already on the books for next week. But as he previewed the bridge's anticipated completion date later this year, he seemed to add yet another visit. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BIDEN: And by Christmas, God willing, we'll be walking. I'm coming back to walk over this sucker. SPRUNT: Barbara Sprunt, NPR News, Washington.

Former Trump press staffer Karoline Leavitt has won the Republican primary in New Hampshire's 1st Congressional District, according to a race call by The Associated Press. Leavitt, 25, is only the second member of Generation Z to win a House primary and the first Republican. The 2022 midterm season is the first time the eldest Gen Zers are eligible to run for the U.S. House of Representatives, where 25 is the minimum age to serve. Leavitt will now face off against incumbent Democrat Chris Pappas, 42, to represent the district \u2014 a toss-up seat Republicans hope to flip as part of their goal of winning back the majority of seats in the House. \"They said I was too young, we could never raise the money to compete, and that we could never beat a former Republican nominee,\" Leavitt said in her victory speech Tuesday night. \"Over the last year we were outspent but we were not outworked,\" she exclaimed. \"No way!\" Leavitt defeated former Trump State Department official Matt Mowers, 33, who ran for the seat in 2020 and lost to Pappas by 5 percentage points. Mowers released a statement in which he pledged to \"never stop fighting\" for middle class families. Though Mowers narrowly led in polls against Leavitt ahead of the primary, the most recent University of New Hampshire survey added uncertainty, finding that nearly a fourth of respondents were still undecided just two weeks from the election. The two candidates also ran with similar platforms, branding themselves as staunch conservatives and political outsiders \u2014 while simultaneously promoting their time working in the Trump administration. Where they differ is on the result of the 2020 election \u2014 Leavitt openly trumpeted the former president's lie that he won, while Mowers has not directly addressed it. Matt Mowers speaks during the final primary debate before Tuesday's race.\n                \n                    \n                    Mary Schwalm/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Matt Mowers speaks during the final primary debate before Tuesday's race. Trump did not endorse a candidate in the primary race, but the matchup divided support among Republican leaders in Congress. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Louisiana Rep. Steve Scalise, the two highest-ranking House Republicans, threw their support behind Mowers. While New York Rep. Elise Stefanik \u2014 ranking third \u2014 backed Leavitt, who previously served as her spokeswoman in Congress. Leavitt's connection to Stefanik partially links back to her historic start in Congress, when the New York Congresswoman made history in 2014 as the youngest woman ever elected to the House when she took office. \"[Stefanik] was one of the few people, frankly, in Washington that believed in me to do this,\" Leavitt told NPR in an interview earlier this summer. \"I know Elise received that same condemnation when she wanted to run, so she really believed in me and believed that I had what it took,\" she added. Throughout her campaign, Leavitt framed her youth as an asset rather than a deterrent \u2014 arguing that younger voters need to hear from more conservative voices \u2014 even though a majority of those voters lean towards Democratic candidates. \"It's a very one-sided culture that we live in,\" Leavitt told NPR, \"How do we break through that mold? It's by electing young people to office that can resonate with these voters, have a platform at the national stage, that can show them ideas, policies, values that they're not hearing elsewhere.\" But for Mowers, who's 33 years old and would easily be considered a younger member of Congress, in this race, Leavitt is nearly a decade younger, putting generational differences in the political spotlight. Leavitt's win comes less than a month after Democratic candidate Maxwell Frost made history as the first member of Gen Z to win a congressional primary.

Petro is ahead in the polls for this Sunday's election, but it's expected to go to a second round in June. BOGOT\u00c1, Colombia \u2014 At his final campaign rally before Colombia's first-round presidential election on Sunday, Gustavo Petro gleefully noted that the powers that be are cringing at the thought that he could win. \"Of course they are scared,\" Petro, a former left-wing-guerrilla-turned-politician, told thousands of supporters in Bogot\u00e1, the capital. \"They're scared because we're going to kick them out of power.\" Polls place Petro as the clear front-runner and, if elected, he has pledged to bring major changes to Colombia that have upset the business class. But if none of the candidates garners more than half of the ballots on Sunday, as the polls are also predicting, the two top vote-getters will meet in a runoff on June 19. Presidential candidate Gustavo Petro talks during a presidential debate at the El Tiempo newspaper in Bogot\u00e1 on Monday, ahead of the first-round May 29 elections.\n                \n                    \n                    Fernando Vergara/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Presidential candidate Gustavo Petro talks during a presidential debate at the El Tiempo newspaper in Bogot\u00e1 on Monday, ahead of the first-round May 29 elections. The other main candidates are Federico Guti\u00e9rrez, a conservative former Medell\u00edn mayor, Rodolfo Hern\u00e1ndez, a populist businessman and former mayor of the city of Bucaramanga, and Sergio Fajardo, a centrist former Medell\u00edn mayor and former governor of Antioquia department. Polls predict that in a second round, Petro would beat Guti\u00e9rrez or Fajardo. But some surveys place Petro in a statistical dead heat with Hern\u00e1ndez, who has avoided debates and in-person campaign events in favor of social media videos. Still, he has moved up in recent polls and has connected to many Colombians with his pledges to eliminate corruption. Colombian presidential candidates Federico Guti\u00e9rrez (left) and Rodolfo Hern\u00e1ndez hold up signs during a debate in Bogot\u00e1 on April 20.\n                \n                    \n                    Juan Barreto/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Colombian presidential candidates Federico Guti\u00e9rrez (left) and Rodolfo Hern\u00e1ndez hold up signs during a debate in Bogot\u00e1 on April 20. \"I'm going to go after all the politicians who are thieves,\" Hern\u00e1ndez, 77, said Wednesday in an interview on Colombian TV. \"They are not all thieves, but nearly all of them are.\" However, in the runup to the election it's Petro who has made most of the headlines and has caused the most consternation among business leaders, the military and conservative voters in a nation that has never before elected a left-wing president. Petro once tried to fight his way to power as a member of the M-19 guerrilla group. The rebels signed a peace treaty in 1990 and since then, Petro has served in Congress and as mayor of Bogot\u00e1. Now on his third run for the presidency, Petro, 62, hopes to join a growing number of leftists now governing much of Latin America, including Mexico, Nicaragua, Venezuela, Peru, Chile and Argentina. Petro promises to hike taxes on the rich to pay for anti-poverty programs. He wants to renegotiate trade agreements, including with the United States, he says, to better protect Colombia's industries and agriculture. To forge a greener economy, he wants to phase out the production of oil, the country's biggest export, and replace that income with tourism. But all this could provoke capital flight, business closures and massive unemployment, according to many business leaders, who are urging Colombians to reject Petro at the ballot box on Sunday. \"Without a doubt Colombia has problems. But that's no reason to leap into the void or to risk radical change,\" Miguel Cort\u00e9s, one of Colombia's most influential businessmen, said in a video message to voters. Another business owner, Sergio Araujo, recently tweeted that he would fire any of his employees that voted for Petro. In an interview with the Colombian newsmagazine Semana, Araujo called Petro a \"destroyer of businesses who has spent five decades fighting against free enterprise in Colombia.\" Some middle-class Colombians are also worried. Roxanne Restrepo, who works in banking and finance in Bogot\u00e1, is nervous about Petro's plan to borrow from private pension funds in order to expand retirement benefits for poor Colombians. And she's not waiting for the election to take action. \"I've been sending some of my savings offshore and we've been searching to see if we can get Portuguese citizenship to see if we need to leave the country,\" Restrepo says. Petro has also picked fights with the Colombian army, suggesting last month that some of its top officers are working in cahoots with drug traffickers. That prompted a furious anti-Petro tirade on Twitter from army commander Gen. Eduardo Zapateiro, even though under Colombia's constitution the military is supposed to stay out of politics. Former army Col. John Marulanda, who fought against Petro during the guerrilla war and now heads a national association of retired military officers, put it bluntly in an interview with NPR: \"We don't want an ex-guerrilla, a retired guerrilla being the president of Colombia. And if it happens, we declare ourselves in opposition.\" Marulanda and others also question Petro's commitment to democracy. For one thing, Petro intends to forge closer ties to the authoritarian regime in neighboring Venezuela. That poses a significant shift for Colombia, long closely aligned with the U.S. and a staunch critic of the government in Caracas. Because his Historic Pact political coalition would lack a majority in Congress, Petro has talked of passing economic laws by decree. Not only \"is he now proposing a radical change in the economy, but he's actually pressing the nuclear button on what he could potentially do to democracy,\" says Sergio Guzm\u00e1n, director of the consulting firm Colombia Risk Analysis.

Petro claims such criticisms are unfair and has pointed out that President Iv\u00e1n Duque, who isn't allowed to run for a second consecutive term, also passed economic laws by decree during the pandemic. Frustrated over accusations from opposition candidates that he plans to seize private property if he wins the presidency, Petro held a news conference at a notary public where he signed a document pledging not to expropriate farms and businesses. And in an interview with NPR last month, Petro denied that he had a radical agenda. He pointed out that the United Nations is urging countries to transition away from hydrocarbons and that raising taxes on the rich to help the poor is common sense in the wake of a pandemic that drove Colombia's poverty rate from 35.7% to 42.5% in 2020. \"These are normal things,\" Petro said, speaking on Zoom. But in Colombia \"they are seen as leftist and revolutionary.\" Many frustrated Colombians agree with Petro. They include Sara Gallego, 34, an athletic trainer who attended Petro's closing campaign rally. She checked off a long list of the country's woes \u2014 from unemployment to malnutrition \u2014 that she says have been ignored by President Duque and previous governments. That's why, she says, the traditional ruling elite has only itself to blame for Petro's popularity.",

Many who monitor extremist activity worry that the country is in a much more dangerous place now.  A MART\u00cdNEZ, HOST: In the weeks after a pro-Trump mob stormed the Capitol, many Americans had hoped that the worst was behind us. President Joe Biden put voice to that hope in his inaugural address. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Together, we shall write an American story of hope, not fear, of unity, not division, of light, not darkness. MART\u00cdNEZ: But the past 12 months have not been a time of unity. In fact, many who monitor extremist activity worry that the country is in a much more dangerous place now than it was a year ago. NPR's Odette Yousef covers domestic extremism. Odette, these warnings that the U.S. may be at a much more dangerous place now than a year ago, who's saying that? And what do they mean? ODETTE YOUSEF, BYLINE: Well, A, I'm hearing concern from both democracy experts and people who've studied conflicts in places where ideologically driven violence has taken root. And one of the most troubling developments they raise is that in the last 12 months, the number of Americans, particularly on the right, who feel violence may be necessary to settle political differences has grown. And we're not just talking about the traditional model of extremists that the U.S. is accustomed to dealing with. We're, you know, not talking about neo-Nazis, skinheads or anti-government militias anymore. We're talking about largely middle-class Americans with jobs, with families, who are starting to sympathize with views that have in the past been considered on the fringe. Here's how Robert Pape of the University of Chicago put it. ROBERT PAPE: We need to realize that this isn't just something to hand off to law enforcement and think, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Just, you know, the FBI - this is just an FBI sort of problem. No, this is an all-hands-on-deck problem here. And that's why democracy is under challenge. MART\u00cdNEZ: Democracy under challenge. Odette, how did we get here? YOUSEF: You know, it's interesting, A, because immediately after January 6 last year, the movement kind of went underground, you know? We saw former President Trump kicked off Twitter. Some online spaces for the far right, like Parler, disappeared. Things kind of went quiet. But over the year, things changed, you know? We started to see far-right actors organize more offline and decentralize their activity to more local settings, like school board meetings, you know, where they latched onto issues like racially inclusive education or vaccine mandates. Mary McCord of Georgetown University worked with the Atlantic Council to track this evolution. And she saw how that grassroots approach filtered up. MARY MCCORD: To me, one of the most alarming developments of 2021 since the insurrection has been the effort, especially among influencers and politicians, to normalize or mainstream conspiracy theories, most predominantly election denial, and to also normalize in mainstream political, ideologically driven violence. YOUSEF: And so what's really taken root, A, in the last year is a profound shift in American culture and politics. MART\u00cdNEZ: And, Odette, extremism is your reporting focus. Does this feel like something new to you, something we haven't seen before? Or, you know, is it now just mainstream? YOUSEF: You know, this blurring of what's extreme versus what's mainstream is something that comes up in, like, every interview I do, A. MART\u00cdNEZ: (Laughter) Yeah. YOUSEF: And a few months ago, I remember speaking with an anti-fascist researcher who told me that she's stopped doing her work because it's no longer as simple as researching neo-Nazis and white nationalists in her neighborhood, you know? She honestly didn't know what to do about suburban moms who seemed to have been radicalized over issues like kids wearing masks at school. And so figuring this out as a nation, A, will take more than the traditional approach of looking to law enforcement. It's just not clear now what that's going to look like.

            "article_content": "The midterms went better for President Biden than most polls and pundits predicted. He gave a rare formal press conference Wednesday and took a victory lap.  AILSA CHANG, HOST: Midterms are traditionally tough for the party in power, especially for presidents whose popularity ratings are not that great. But last night, things went surprisingly well for Democrats and for President Biden. Today, he took a bit of a victory lap at the White House. (SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE) PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: It was a good day, I think, for democracy. And I think it was a good day for America. CHANG: It was a rare formal press conference for President Biden. And here to give us more details is NPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith. Hey, Tam. TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Hey, Ailsa. CHANG: All right. So in recent history, presidents who do this day-after-the-Election-Day press conference, they usually or they have used words like shellacking or thumpin' to describe what happened to their party in the midterms. Can you tell us, like, how did President Biden describe this election? KEITH: Well, this wasn't a thumpin' or a shellacking, and he avoided adding any new adjectives to the political lexicon. I would say that he was relaxed. He was confident. As we know, control of both the House and the Senate are still up in the air. But he said that the message that he took from the election was that the American people want him to work together with Congress. And to that end, he plans to invite leaders over to the White House later this month. But I have to say, he was also unapologetic. When asked how he would change or what he would change about his governing going forward, he said he wouldn't change a thing. CHANG: But, really, isn't it a little soon to be doing a victory lap here? Like, we don't even know how this is all going to shake out yet or how his agenda will be affected by the results, right? KEITH: Yeah. He was asked about his agenda going forward, and he said that he would veto any attempts to reverse the legislation that he and Democrats passed in the first two years and that he would not accept any cuts to Medicare or Social Security. In not so many words, he seemed to be saying that if Congress passed nothing else, he would still consider it a success to implement what has already been passed in the first two years. And he was relatively dismissive of the House Republican leader, Kevin McCarthy, saying that he hadn't had much need to interact with him before. CHANG: Right. KEITH: If Republicans do end up winning control of the Senate, that could put the brakes on Biden's efforts to get judges confirmed. But with divided government, ambitions generally get scaled back. You and I have both covered divided government, you know, and things like just keeping the lights on and keeping the government funded can be challenge enough. Asked about potential investigations, including into his son, Hunter, Biden implied that Republicans could end up overreaching. (SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE) BIDEN: I think the American people will look at all of that for what it is. It's just almost comedy. I mean, it's - but, you know, look; I can't control what they're going to do. All I can do is continue to try to make life better for the American people. KEITH: And that sounded to me like a president who, if his party doesn't have control of Congress, will take a political foil as a consolation prize. CHANG: Well, Biden has said in the past that he does intend to run for president in 2024. Do these midterms make that even more likely now? Like, what did he say about that? KEITH: Yeah, he was asked a couple of times. He reiterated that he plans to run and that the midterms didn't affect that. But he also said, as he has before, that he respects fate and that he has to have a family conversation, one that he expects will happen sometime between Thanksgiving and the new year. Here's what he said. (SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE) BIDEN: My judgment of running when I announce, if I - my intention is that I run again. But I'm a great respecter of fate. And this is ultimately a family decision. I think everybody wants me to run, but we're going to have discussions about it. And I don't feel in any a hurry one way or another. KEITH: He was asked what he would say to Americans who don't want him to run, and he said, watch me. And then he was asked about the possibility of former President Trump and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis running, and he laughed and said that it would be fun to watch them take each other on. CHANG: Anything else stand out to you from this press conference? KEITH: He was asked to weigh in on Elon Musk and his purchase of Twitter with help from foreign governments, including Saudi Arabia. And Biden said that he thought that that was something that should be looked at, though he was quite careful in choosing his words. CHANG: That is NPR's Tamara Keith. Thank you so much, Tam.

KHALID: You know, his essential message is that Republicans are going to come after government programs like Medicare and Social Security. We've been hearing a lot of that on the campaign trail these last few days. You know, Biden is a long-time former senator, a lawmaker. And so in his campaign speeches, he's not necessarily delivering stirring speeches. He's running through a list of all the bills he signed and what they do - from curbing climate change to lowering prescription drug costs, to protecting veterans, to boosting semiconductor manufacturing in the U.S., to improving infrastructure. And, you know, frankly, as I listed them all out there, you know, Ayesha, there are a bunch of laws that Democrats have passed to this point, some with bipartisan support. And a lot of the changes the president has introduced, like lowering the cost of insulin, are objectively popular. As we were about to fly off from San Diego to Chicago on Friday, the president came over to us reporters and told us that what gives him the most confidence about the midterms at this point is the policies themselves. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: We're going to win this time around, I think. I feel really good about our chances. I haven't been in all the House races, but I think they're going to keep the Senate and pick up a seat. I think we have a chance of winning the House. I don't think we're going to not win keeping the House. So I'm optimistic. I really am. RASCOE: Well, that sounds very upbeat. And the president, you know, as you said, has been talking about, you know, strong job numbers and some economic growth. But voters are dealing with inflation and other issues. Like, how has he been addressing that? KHALID: Ayesha, inflation is really the key issue in this election. It has been top priority for voters for months, and it has been a real challenge for this White House. As one Democratic analyst told me, no message is going to be able to divert people's attention away from their wallets. And so in this final stretch, the president is now trying to turn the inflation story on its head and make the case that if Republicans take control of Congress, inflation will get worse, that they will try to repeal laws that will cut costs. He's trying to convince voters that this election is a choice on the economy and also on democracy. Here's how he put it at a rally in San Diego for Congressman Mike Levin. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BIDEN: I said this election is not a referendum. It's a choice, a basic choice. So I call on Democrats when everything is at stake and mainstream Republicans and independents to come together to meet this moment. RASCOE: OK. So you traveled with the president to New Mexico, California and Illinois. Those are pretty safe Democratic states. And then you went to Pennsylvania yesterday, which is, you know, neck and neck for a Senate race and could decide the control of the Senate. Biden had a big guest there. Tell us what that was like. KHALID: That's right. Biden was joined by former President Barack Obama, and it was like a rock concert. The vibe was really different than some of his other campaign events. Over 7,000 people filed in to Temple University in Philadelphia. A lot of young people and Democrats have been eager to energize young voters. This was actually the first time that Biden and Obama had appeared together at a campaign event. Obama has been trying to get out the Democratic vote in states like Arizona and Georgia, which both have extremely competitive Senate contests. And the president, President Biden, has stayed away from those states, frankly, because his approval rating is low and his presence could possibly hurt the Senate candidates more than it helps. But yesterday, Obama and Biden joined forces to campaign for Democrats in Pennsylvania. Ayesha, I also want to point out that former President Donald Trump was also in Pennsylvania yesterday, and the fact that there were a trio of presidents past and present in Pennsylvania on the same day to me is a sign of how important that state is going to be in determining control of the Senate. RASCOE: That's NPR White House correspondent Asma Khalid. Thank you so much, Asma. KHALID: Always a pleasure. Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Progressive activist Maxwell Frost, one of the first members of Generation Z to run for Congress, has won his Democratic primary, according to a race call by The Associated Press. Frost's win nearly secures his path to Congress since the Orlando-based seat is considered a solidly Democratic district. Frost will face off against Republican Calvin Wimbish in November. \"Today's election is proof that Central Florida's working families want representation that has the courage to ask for more,\" Frost said in a statement. \"I share this victory with the nurses, forklift drivers, teachers, caregivers, social workers, farmers, union organizers, cashiers, and other members of this vibrant community who supported this campaign.\" At 25 years old, Frost just qualifies for the age requirement to serve in the U.S. House. The 2022 midterms mark the first election where members of Generation Z can run for congressional office. The Pew Research Center considers anyone born between 1997 and 2012 to be Gen Z. Frost campaigned on key progressive issues, including Medicare for All, a Green New Deal, student debt cancelation and an end to gun violence. He first became involved in political organizing in 2012 while in high school following the mass shooting in Newtown, Conn. He's also spoken publicly about surviving a separate incident of gun violence. \"Our generation has been born into a lot of trauma and a lot of civil unrest around people being frustrated with things. And I think because of that, our generation naturally thinks about things in a bit of a different way,\" Frost told NPR. The former March for Our Lives national organizing director and ACLU activist beat out a crowded field of nine other competitors, including state Sen. Randolph Bracy and former Florida Reps. Corrine Brown and Alan Grayson. Frost also topped his competitors in fundraising while racking up key national endorsements from progressive leaders, including Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. In an interview with NPR, Frost acknowledged that age plays a symbolic role in his campaign. \"Yes we march, yes we engage in mutual aid, yes we engage on social media, and now we're running for office because we believe that we are prepared to be in the rooms and to be the voice for our communities and we can do that and young people should be allowed,\" he said.",
