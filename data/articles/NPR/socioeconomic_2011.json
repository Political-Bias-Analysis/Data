            "article_content": "Peruvians go to the polls Sunday to elect their next president. Their choice is between a leftist nationalist and a right-wing legislator.  JACKI LYDEN, Host: Reporter Annie Murphy is in Peru and joins us to talk about today's election. Hello, Annie. ANNIE MURPHY: Hi, there. LYDEN: Annie, tell us a bit more about these candidates. They are radically different. MURPHY: Then you have Ollanta Humala, who on the other hand, is a leftist who served in the military. Humala ran for president in 2006 and he had widespread support. Back then he also had ties to Hugo Chavez. Now he's much more moderate, more like Brazil's former president Inacio Lula da Silva. LYDEN: Apart from their background, what are the main election issues for voters? MURPHY: Today, Peruvians talk mainly about wanting the economy to stay strong. Growth is about 7 percent right now. Many Peruvians worry about basic citizen security, particularly in Lima; education, poverty reduction. And lastly the environment is becoming a growing concern for some sectors. Particularly for indigenous groups whose land rights have been trampled by biggest extraction projects. LYDEN: How is it that two such potentially polarizing candidates, as you described, are the last one standing? MURPHY: Improving democracy is still quite young in a lot of ways, given that the return to a democratic government happened just a decade ago. So, like most of Latin America, there are still a huge socioeconomic inequality here, which means an entrenched elite still calls the shots. That's kind of a big part of what's going on today. LYDEN: The winner of this election succeeds Alan Garcia. What kind of leader was he? MURPHY: This time, his approval ratings has rarely been over 30 percent, so he hasn't gained much popularity. On the other hand, though, Peru's seen an economic boom under Garcia, so that's important to note, and the poverty rate has fallen. So. he's overseen some growth improve, but a lot of the population is not behind him. LYDEN: Annie Murphy joined us from Lima, Peru. Thank you very much, Annie. MURPHY: Thank you.

Some believe that economic woes will make it hard for Ahmadinejad to hold on to his working-class base.\n                \n                    \n                    Atta Kenare /AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad waves to supporters during a rally in Tehran in February. Some believe that economic woes will make it hard for Ahmadinejad to hold on to his working-class base. Dariush Zahedi is a lecturer in the political science department at the University of California, Berkeley. Hamed Aleaziz is a freelance journalist. On Feb. 28, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad boldly declared, \"Iran is among the few countries in the world where no one goes to bed hungry.\" It's hardly the first grandiose claim the Iranian president has made about the state of the Iranian economy. He recently announced that unemployment would be eradicated in two years. And the president defiantly insisted last November that Iran's economy is booming, despite international sanctions. These sorts of hubristic pronouncements once made Ahmadinejad popular among his base of lower-working-class supporters, who benefited from government handouts. But these days, the president's exaggerations are running up against economic reality: For the average Iranian, times are tough. The country's economy is weak, unemployment has skyrocketed to 14.6 percent officially (real numbers are surely higher), and inflation is creeping up as the government cuts subsidies on energy, food, and other consumer goods. So stark is the contrast between the government line and reality that, for the first time, Ahmadinejad's perpetual optimism is losing \u2014 rather than winning \u2014 supporters. The president's claim about hunger in Iran went down particularly poorly with his base among the lower class. The next day, on March 1, when Ahmadinejad delivered a speech in the industrial city of Khorramabad, whose working-class population once warmly embraced him, he found the mood rather cold. A sign held up above the crowd read, \"We the workers of Parsilon [a factory] are hungry.\" Another sign in the crowd read, \"Swear to God, we've come to a breaking point from all the discrimination and injustice.\" Such workers have historically made up a significant portion of Ahmadinejad's base. Their loyalty cemented with generous government largesse, they mostly stayed on the side of the president after the contested June 2009 election, when thousands of protesters took to the streets to denounce the results. Those discontents called themselves the Green Movement, drawn primarily from the ranks of the middle class, intelligentsia, and students. The underclass, still loyal to the regime and Ahmadinejad, became known as the Blues, to underscore the fact that, to the extent that they had jobs, they were primarily engaged in blue-collar professions. Although the Greens and Blues were once split by socioeconomic and political lines, the parlous state of the economy is making the line between them less distinct: The Blues are going Green. How did the president's base falter? For starters, Ahmadinejad spent more than two years trying to convince the Iranian parliament to let him ease fuel and other subsidies, a move that according to the IMF was supposed to \"serve the dual purpose of generating more revenue for the country and curbing the wasteful use of energy.\" Ahmadinejad won the political battle to lift the subsidies, but he hasn't succeeded in controlling the inflation and economic mayhem that have resulted. The government's attempts to mitigate the inflationary effects of the president's fiscal and monetary reforms are undermining Iran's already anemic rate of economic growth, bankrupting firms, and exacerbating employment. Indeed, according to several recent reports, including one by Djavad Salehi-Isfahani of the Brookings Institution, the Iranian economy is on a precipice. Ahmadinejad's new subsidies plan, which eliminates heavy discounts on fuel and food, has thus far pushed inflation to an annual rate of 15 percent, which may well rise further. The prices of important consumer and food staples have risen even faster; the price of bread has doubled, and gas prices have quadrupled. The government is attempting to alleviate the effects of increased prices by providing its citizens with handouts of cash. But by every indication, the economy is still going to get worse, something that could give the opposition increased ammunition. The Economist Intelligence Unit's Iran report, published in December, predicts that inflation will continue to plague the country for at least the next four years. All these rising costs will begin to fuel a vicious cycle, Salehi-Isfahani fears: Rather than buying locally made goods, Iranians will be more likely to consume imports, spending \"their subsidy money on imported goods on which prices do not rise.\" To make matters worse, Ahmadinejad's preferred method for combating inflation is keeping the value of Iran's exchange rate artificially high and flooding the market with cheap imports, primarily from China. And finally, adding to the general apprehension is a recent Ahmadinejad budget that relies on an inconceivable $13 billion rise in oil exports for 2011. The youth stand to bear the brunt of this economic downturn. According to estimates by researchers Omid Memarian and Tara Nesvaderani, unemployment among young Iranians already stands at 70 percent. Although at first glance this might appear an exaggerated figure, the estimate is probably not widely off the mark. Independent economists have consistently maintained that the actual rate of unemployment in Iran is probably twice the officially announced figure and that unemployment in the ranks of the youth is double the overall figure. Moreover, it doesn't appear that Ahmadinejad's cash handouts will relieve their situation. In fact, the Economist Intelligence Unit predicts that youth unemployment will rise further in the coming year. A recent report by Iranian government researchers shows that about half of Iranians living in urban centers are living below the poverty line. Out of work and living with little means, young lower-class Iranians could quickly grow frustrated with their government's inability to provide them with decent jobs. Enter the Green Movement, which understands that its opposition would be significantly stronger if the Blues would come on board. Although currently under house arrest, the Green Movement's leaders, Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi, attempted to reach out to the Blues prior to their incarceration. The most recent Green manifesto, for example, released in this February and signed by both Mousavi and Karroubi, seeks to broaden the base of the movement beyond the middle and educated classes by appealing to workers and farmers, as well as ethnic and religious minorities. Apart from calling for free, fair, and competitive elections as well as the establishment of an accountable government that protects civil, minority, and women's rights, the manifesto calls for the necessity of promoting social and economic justice. If this approach is even marginally successful, cracks may well develop in the government's security structure. The Basij security forces, which became well-known for their prominent role in the suppression of the 2009 protests, are the \"enforcers\" of the current regime \u2014 and the Basij are made up primarily of lower-class youth. As their families' economic conditions worsen, however, Basij loyalty to the government may no longer be taken for granted. If working-class families join the Green opposition in the streets, the Basij would be confronted by their friends and family members in the very crowds they are charged to control. Perhaps this might impel them to have second thoughts about firing on the demonstrators. As its leaders understand, the Green Movement's future hinges crucially on its ability to make common cause with the Blues. The continued deterioration of the economy creates that opportunity; only time will tell whether it will come to more than that.",

But they won't get you a trip to Hawaii.\n                \n                    \n                    Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Food stamps aren't \"stamps\" anymore \u2014 they're debit cards. But they won't get you a trip to Hawaii. The image of rich folks using food stamps to buy filet mignon is becoming the 21st-century version of the Reagan-era \"Welfare Queen.\" GOP presidential candidate Newt Gingrich has become particularly fond of the notion, claiming that people can even use food stamps for a trip to Hawaii. In a Nov. 30 appearance caught by ABC News, the former House speaker said: \"They give food stamps now to millionaires because, after all, don't you want to be compassionate?\" Unfortunately for the millions of Americans who could really use a trip to Hawaii right about now, that's not true. But increasingly, people who live in  ritzy ZIP codes are finding it harder to pay for groceries, according to new data. New Jersey's Hunterdon County, where the median household income is $97,874, led the nation in rising food stamp use, according to an analysis of Census Bureau data by Bloomberg News. In Hunterdon, an idyllic-looking place of horse farms and covered bridges southwest of New York City, food stamp enrollment rose 513 percent from 2007 to 2010, from 232 people in 2007 to 1,424 in 2010. In that span, the percentage of households using food stamps more than doubled in six of the 10 wealthiest counties in the nation, according to the Bloomberg report. These folks, though, likely fell an income bracket or two before they signed up; persistent joblessness and people's inability to sell their homes were the main drivers of need, Bloomberg reports. Those formerly rich folks are not alone. Nationwide, requests for food assistance have increased in 25 of 29 cities over the past year, according to a survey released today by the  U.S. Conference of Mayors.  Unemployment was the chief reason people listed for needing help from food stamps or food banks. \"The problem is acute, and it's growing,\" Sly James, mayor of Kansas City, Mo., said at a press conference announcing the survey results. His city is trying to help by filling children's backpacks with food staples on Friday, so the family can eat over the weekend. \"The unfortunate part is that the number of children affected seems to be on the increase.\" Nationwide, more people have turned for help to the federal food stamp program, officially known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, than ever before, with more than 40 million people enrolled. That hasn't gone without notice in Washington, where legislators have been making noise about banning millionaires from unemployment insurance and food stamps. Shades of the 1970s, when then-presidential candidate Ronald Reagan would complain about \"a woman in Chicago\" who he said was raking in over $150,000 a year in benefits including food stamps, welfare, and Social Security.  The truth was less inflammatory; Linda Taylor was eventually found guilty of using two aliases to collect $8,000 in welfare checks. But the press dubbed her the \"Welfare Queen,\" and the myth was born. Gingrich's claims of food stamp millionaires and food stamps trips to Hawaii have been efficiently debunked by PolitiFact. Indeed, these days the odds of a millionaire getting food stamps are pretty darned slim, since a person's household income can't exceed 130 percent of the poverty line, or $2,008 a month for a family of four, to qualify.  When applying, people have to list all sources of income, including stock dividends, as well as cash in the bank. That includes Swiss bank accounts, too. (Try this online screening tool to see if you qualify.) But some millionaires do slip through the cracks. Earlier this year, Michigan resident Leroy Fick earned infamy as the food stamp version of the Welfare Queen when people saw him using a food stamp debit card to buy groceries after he'd won $2 million in the state's lottery.  State officials said he still met the income threshold for assistance, but lawmakers quickly moved to change regulations that would allow such largess. Fick, of Auburn,  Mich., told a local TV station \"If you're going to ... try to make me feel bad, you aren't going to do it. It ain't going to happen.\" Here's hoping he's since cracked into those lottery winnings to bring home the bacon.",

            "article_content": " Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain speaks on Friday while unveiling his \"Opportunity Zone\" economic plan in front of the Michigan Central Station, an abandoned train depot in Detroit.  Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain speaks on Friday while unveiling his \"Opportunity Zone\" economic plan in front of the Michigan Central Station, an abandoned train depot in Detroit. Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain's 9-9-9 tax plan has taken a lot of heat  recently.  One of the biggest criticisms: several independent analysts have  found that under the plan, poor and middle class families would pay higher taxes  while the richest of the rich would see a substantial tax cut.  Today in  Detroit, Cain  unveiled his response. \"If you're at or below  the poverty level, your plan isn't 9-9-9,\" said Cain with the abandoned  Michigan Central Station in the background. \"It's 9-0-9.\" As a reminder, Cain's  plan would scrap the current tax code and replace it with a nine percent  business tax, a nine income tax and a nine percent sales tax.  For the poor,  Cain says income taxes would be zeroed out.  But at least one tax expert says  this doesn't solve the problem. Roberton Williams with  the non-partisan Tax Policy  Center says even with this  change the lowest income Americans would see their tax bills rise because the  business tax would trickle down to them and \"you would still have the sales  tax,\" says Williams. It would still be \"nine percent on every dollar they spend,  and for poor families, that's a deal breaker.\" The Tax Policy Center released an analysis earlier this  week that found 84 percent of families would see their tax burden increase under  the Cain plan.  Williams says this change likely doesn't affect the outcome. \"A few who currently  pay somewhat higher taxes now for various reasons might be better off, but for  the most part, we'd still expect to see close to 84 percent of families being  made worse off by the Cain plan,\" says Williams. For cities, Cain introduced the  concept of \"Opportunity Zones\" \u2014 areas where there would be special  tax advantages to encourage businesses to hire, though he didn't provide a lot  of detail about exactly how it would work or how the zones would be chosen. It's unclear whether the plan would  generate enough tax revenue after these changes \u2014 though Cain insists it remains  revenue neutral. \"We already had this provision in  there and we still raised the same amount of money,\" he said at the  event. Wait?  Is Cain saying he's had a  provision for poor people in his 9-9-9 plan all along?  Yes, and he says his  critics just haven't been reading his plan carefully  enough. Language about the plan on his  website has changed over time. But, as of this  writing, it doesn't say anything about people at or below the poverty line, and  neither does his new brochure about the Opportunity Zones.  An analysis of the  plan commissioned by the Cain campaign and posted on its website says the  following: Relief  for lower income taxpayers will inevitably be part of any tax reform. To  illustrate the effect that progressivity could have on tax rates, we will later  derive the rates needed to allow a refundable  exemption equal to the poverty level of income. This is the same as a refundable  credit equal to the tax rate times the poverty level of income. This simplifies  the estimation as the  aggregate poverty amount is just subtracted from the gross tax base for each  proposal. Last week, I  interviewed Gary Robbins of Fiscal Associates who did the analysis.  When he did  his calculations, he figured that there would be a poverty grant of some kind so  that \"no one in poverty would actually owe any tax.\" I asked him if that  was part of the Cain plan.  His response: \"I don't know...this is sort of  hypothetical on my part because I don't know how they're going to structure  it.\" The tax break for  those in poverty outlined by the campaign today, is far smaller than what  Robbins had calculated.  It's not clear whether the Opportunity Zones make up  the difference or whether they were in the plan all along.  The description of  9-9-9 on Cain's website mentions only Empowerment Zones, not Opportunity  Zones.",

(AP Photo/Mike Carlson)  MICHEL MARTIN, Host: I'm Michel Martin and this is TELL ME MORE from NPR News. We're going to spend a good deal of time today talking about money, how much the government has to spend and how much and how little many American families have. Later we're going to talk about that special Congressional Committee that's been charged with coming up with a plan to take a big bite out of the federal deficit. That group held it's first public hearing on Tuesday. We're also going to hear about a new survey that says a significant number of wealthy baby boomers are not at all interested in leaving money to their children. We're going to hear more about that also. But first we want to talk about those new numbers describing poverty in America. According to new census bureau, numbers released on Tuesday, another 2.6 million people were added to the ranks of America's poor last year. That's a total of 46 million Americans who are considered poor taking the nations poverty rate to 15.1 percent, the highest level since 1993. Also, median household income dropped and nearly 50 million people did not have health insurance. We are going to hear two views about what should be done about this. First up is a man who thinks he can do a better job leading the nation back to prosperity than the man currently in the White House. Herman Cain is running for the Republican presidential nomination. He's made a strong impression in the early debates. He's the former CEO of Godfathers Pizza, which he is credited with turning around. Welcome to the program, Mr. Cain. Thanks so much for joining us. HERMAN CAIN: It's my pleasure Michel, thank you. MARTIN: First I wanted to ask you, do you think that the poverty rate as described by the Census Bureau is in fact a big deal? CAIN: I think it's atrocious and it is a big deal, and one of the main economic guiding principles is that the business sector is the engine of economic growth, and unfortunately that engine is not getting any fuel. That engine didn't get any fuel with that nearly one trillion dollars, where sometimes they call it 800 billion and sometimes they call it 870 billion, but if you add in all of the other trinkets, the cash for clunkers programs, let's round it off to a trillion dollars. It didn't stimulate this economy. We're still in a recession, and so what I'm saying is that's why those numbers are going up. MARTIN: You've called for dramatic tax reform as sort of the centerpiece of your proposal to get the country back to prosperity. You talked about your 999 proposal, a business flat tax of nine percent, an individual flat tax of nine percent, and a national sales tax of nine percent. Could you just briefly tell us why you think this is a better idea than what's been discussed to this point? CAIN: This is a better idea because it broadens the tax base. Because this economy is not growing, the current tax base is just on income, so we broaden the base, also bringing in some revenue from retail sales but also dramatically lower the tax on corporate profits and personal income, we broaden the base. And here's the biggest thing that will make this work. You don't pass this for a trial period. You say to the business community, this tax structure will be our new tax structure until further notice. That's how you put some certainty back into this economy. And the 999 plan, it would collect the same amount of revenue that we get from corporate income taxes, personal income taxes. A payroll tax would also be picked up in this 999 plan along with the estate tax. MARTIN: Does that mean you would eliminate all deductions? Does that mean you would eliminate all deductions like the mortgage interest deduction, the dependent deduction? CAIN: Yes, all of that goes away. But the business piece, your only deduction would be purchases that you make from other businesses to produce your product or service. Personally you are able to deduct contributions. Everything else goes away. MARTIN: How does that work to get people back to work immediately? CAIN: The way it works is that businesses would then be able to plan their growth. Right now they can't plan their growth. The reason they can't plan their growth is because they are not sure of the full impact of ObamaCare. They are not sure of the full impact of the Dodd-Frank regulatory (unintelligible) bill. It has banks sitting in neutral because they're not - you know, they're not loaning money. And then the biggest thing is, we don't know what the tax rates are going to be at the beginning of January of 2013. Uncertainty is what's killing this economy, along with too much taxation and this onslaught of regulations that are coming out of this administration. MARTIN: And finally, Mr. Cain - and we appreciate your taking the time while you're out on the campaign trail - I would like to ask you the same question I had the opportunity to ask President Obama. Since you're both African-American and the unemployment rate among African-Americans is the highest among all ethnic groups in the country, I'd like to ask, do you feel that you have a special responsibility to address this group because of your own background, or not? CAIN: I do feel like I have a special responsibility, but by fulfilling that responsibility it will help everybody that's in that predicament, because see, here's the thing. If you look at the number of jobs held by African-Americans in this country, they held a probably large percentage of blue collar jobs, particularly in the construction industry. Which industry has been hurt the most? Home sales, construction, etc. I know this because I have relatives that have been hard hit, and so my point is, get the economy growing. The housing market is not going to come back until this economy gets going. We need a bold solution. Now, the other thing that I plan to do, which I have not talked about yet, is to create empowerment zones. This is an idea of the (unintelligible) that didn't go very far because of the complexity of the tax code. One of the other big advantages of my 999 plan is it makes it fairly easy for us to identify empowerment zones, and there again you're going to be doing something that's going to hit the black community a lot more than it will the general population. MARTIN: Herman Cain is running for the Republican presidential nomination. He's the former chairman of Godfathers Pizza and a former head of the board of the National Restaurant Association. He was kind enough to join us by phone from the campaign trail. Mr. Cain, thank you so much for joining us. CAIN: It's my pleasure, thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2011 NPR.  All rights reserved.

The country has the eurozone's highest unemployment rate at more than 21 percent.\n                \n                    \n                    Arturo Rodriguez/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption People line up outside an unemployment office in Madrid in February. The country has the eurozone's highest unemployment rate at more than 21 percent. David Horcajada fishes a beer can out of his backpack at a Madrid square. \"Five years ago, believe me, there were really few people drinking on the streets,\" he says. \"Right now, everybody is drinking on the street because people cannot afford to pay for drinks at bars. So since we're Spanish and we do drink, we party a lot, so it doesn't matter if we don't have money. We'll keep doing it.\" Many in the crowd are what locals call mileuristas \u2014 workers on temporary contracts that pay 1 mil  (1,000) euros a month, barely $1,400. That's considered below the poverty line for a family in Spain, and just above it for a single adult. The word used to have a negative connotation. But not in this economy, Horcajada says. When somebody talks about labor-market reform, they think they want to turn the market into something like the U.S. market. But what they don't realize is that they've got 30 percent of their workers with no job security whatsoever, in really inferior conditions, so that the others can enjoy the kind of job security that they have. Gayle Allard, economist at Madrid's IE Business School \"When Spain was booming, like five years ago, just really young people, normally uneducated, were mileuristas,\" he says. \"The thing is that right now, a lot of people are becoming mileuristas, and a lot of people would like to become mileuristas, if they could.\"  Ester Sanz would love to join the ranks of mileuristas. She's a certified teacher but can't find a full-time job.   \"I finished my degree in June last year, and I have a job, but it's only for one hour a day, so it's only 200 euros, but nothing else,\" she says.  On 200 euros a month, less than $300, she has to live with her parents and clip coupons.   \"You try to go with the offers, 'One Euro Wednesday' and things like that, and try to save money, as much as you can,\" she says. A Scarcity of Jobs More than one in five lives below the poverty line in Spain, which has the eurozone's highest unemployment rate at more than 21 percent. For young people, the rate is more than double that. Even for those who have jobs, a third are on temporary contracts, with low pay and no benefits. \"This is what young people do. And they're lucky; they've got a job,\" says Gayle Allard, an economist at Madrid's IE Business School. \"Because the unemployment rate for young people is 46 percent. So, they're the outsiders in the labor market.\"  Spain has a two-tiered labor system. Workers have either temporary contracts or jobs for life. It's a key issue in national elections Nov. 20. But it's also the third rail of Spanish politics, where unions are powerful, Allard says.   \"When somebody talks about labor-market reform, they think they want to turn the market into something like the U.S. market,\" she says. \"But what they don't realize is that they've got 30 percent of their workers with no job security whatsoever, in really inferior conditions, so that the others can enjoy the kind of job security that they have.\"  In the plaza, Horcajada describes how his generation increasingly makes do on 1,000 euros a month.   \"Either you live with your parents, or you share an apartment. The problem is, if you're a mileurista and you're, for example, 30 years old, you're not going to be sharing an apartment when you're 30 years old,\" he says. \"You want your own apartment and your own life. If you're earning 1,000 euros, there's no way you're going to be able to do that in Spain. It's not a cheap country.\"",

            "article_content": "1 of 16 Millions of Egyptians celebrated the country's first transition of power in three decades on Friday, cheering, waving flags and setting off fireworks after President Hosni Mubarak buckled to protesters' demands and stepped down. Listen to NPR's live coverage, hosted by Steve Inskeep and Neal Conan. Vice President Omar Suleiman announced the news on state television and said control would be turned over to the military. \"In these difficult circumstances that the country is passing through, President Hosni Mubarak has decided to leave the position of the presidency,\" Suleiman said in brief remarks just after nightfall. \"He has commissioned the armed forces council to direct the issues of the state.\" In a statement Friday night, Egypt's top military council said Mubarak had \"acted in the interests of the nation.\" The moment the announcement was made, Cairo's Tahrir Square erupted in celebration. People ran through the streets hugging each other and shouting, \"Egypt is free!\" and \"The people have brought down the regime!\" Fireworks and the sounds of car horns and celebratory gunfire filled the air around the city of 18 million. \"It's a national celebration!\" protester Yassmine El-Sayed Hany said. \"We are very lucky to be in the generation to witness this historical moment.\" Still, computer science teacher Ahmed Attal, 29, added a note of caution to the festivities. He said Mubarak's leaving doesn't necessarily mean the structure of his repressive regime is gone. Watch Vice President Omar Suleiman's statement \"It's not over yet,\" he said. \"This one step. Mubarak just one step \u2014 because we have many, many Mubarak in Egypt. These people helped Mubarak destroy Egypt.\" 'I Could Never Have Imagined' \"It's the greatest day of my life,\" opposition leader Mohamed ElBaradei told NPR. \"I could never have imagined that I would live long enough to see Egypt emancipated. It's an electrifying feeling.\" Asked whether he was confident that Egypt was moving toward democracy, ElBaradei said, \"I have assurances that the army will reach out to a wide spectrum of Egyptian society and we will have co-sharing of power with the Egyptian army for a transitional period. \"We always had confidence that the army would come in a crisis, and they have come at exactly the right moment,\" the Nobel Peace laureate said. He estimated that the transition period would last about a year, but others said it was too soon to tell. ElBaradei said he believed that Egypt's emergency law, which gives police virtually unlimited powers of arrest, had been lifted. \"I think it is. I was told \u2014 but it's not confirmed \u2014 that the [military's] first command would be to abolish the emergency law.\" Ayman Nour, who finished second to Mubarak in a disputed 2005 presidential election, told Al-Jazeera television that the nation had \"been born again.\" \"This is a new Egypt,\" the opposition leader said. A spokesman for the Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamist group outlawed in Egypt, said that he welcomed \"the fall of a tyrant\" but that Mubarak's departure was only a first step. \"I think all now are invited ... to launch a real dialogue about the future \u2014 the near future and the far future,\" the spokesman, Essam Al-Aryan, told NPR. The ruling National Democratic Party also was dissolved Friday and the recently appointed general-secretary of the party, Hossam Badrawi, resigned. \"The formation of new parties in a new manner that reflects new thinking is better for society now at this stage,\" Badrawi told al-Hayat TV. The NDP has been at the center of the political repression that has affected many Egyptians. \"The announcement of the dissolution of this party will certainly give a boost to the morale of the protesters,\" NPR's Lourdes Garcia-Navarro reported from Cairo. Mubarak's Precipitous Rise And Fall President Obama, speaking at the White House Friday afternoon, said Mubarak had \"responded to the Egyptian people's hunger for change.\" \"The idea that justice can be enforced through violence\" had been disproved, he said. \"Many questions remain unanswered, but I am confident that Egyptians can find those answers, peacefully,\" Obama said, but added that \"only genuine democracy will carry the day.\" Mubarak and his family reportedly left Cairo on Friday for the Egyptian seaside resort of Sharm el-Sheikh as crowds of protesters swarmed across the capital and other major cities demanding his resignation. His fall came 32 years to the day after the collapse of the shah's government in Iran in 1979. Mubarak was thrust into power in 1981 in the chaotic aftermath of President Anwar Sadat's assassination by Islamist extremists. And he's ruled with a heavy hand for 30 years, making him the longest-serving Egyptian leader since the 19th century. Mubarak resisted calls for reform even as public bitterness grew over corruption, deteriorating infrastructure and rampant poverty in a country where 40 percent live below or near the poverty line. Seeking to cling to power, he addressed the nation Thursday night and said he would retain his title but transfer some of his authority to Suleiman. An explosion of protests Friday rejecting the move appeared to have pushed the military into forcing him out completely. Hundreds of thousands of people had marched throughout the day in cities across the country as soldiers stood by, besieging his palace in Cairo and Alexandria and the state TV building. A governor of a southern province was forced to flee to safety in the face of protests there. Credit: NPR Reports of the president's resignation came hours after the Egyptian military said it would support Mubarak's decision to remain in office through September elections. The Armed Forces Supreme Council released a statement Friday endorsing the plan Mubarak unveiled Thursday night for constitutional changes. The council also guaranteed that Egypt's hated emergency law would be lifted \"immediately after the end of the current circumstances\" \u2014 a reference to the mass protests. The military also called for public services to resume and urged \"the return of normal life in order to safeguard the achievements of our glorious people.\" But the message made no mention of any delegation of  powers from Mubarak to Suleiman, who appears to have lost his position in the  military takeover. Fury, And Then Joy, Across Egypt Friday's jubilation was in sharp contrast to the mood that permeated the country hours before Mubarak's resignation. Tens of thousands of anti-government protesters marched in Alexandria, Egypt's second-largest city, on Friday.\n                \n                    \n                    Tarek Fawzy/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Tens of thousands of anti-government protesters marched in Alexandria, Egypt's second-largest city, on Friday. Mubarak's speech to the nation \u2014 in which he refused to step down and made the symbolic gesture of handing over some authority to Suleiman \u2014 only emboldened the protesters, energizing their call for a \"march of millions\" Friday. About 2,500 demonstrators took their outrage to the gates of the presidential palace on Friday, and more than 10,000 tore apart military barricades in front of the State Television and Radio building. The palace was protected by four tanks and rolls of barbed wire, but soldiers did not prevent people from joining the rally and chanting anti-Mubarak slogans. Outside the palace, the words \"You will be tried\" were written in chalk. Others massed outside the Cabinet, Parliament and state TV headquarters several blocks away from Tahrir Square, the center of the mass rallies that began Jan. 25. Hundreds of demonstrators formed a human barricade around the building that houses state TV and radio, checking IDs and turning away those who work there. Tanks and barbed wire also surrounded the building, but troops did not keep protesters away. In Egypt's second-largest city, Alexandria, NPR's Corey Flintoff said \"tens of thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands\" were peacefully marching along a main boulevard that snakes along the Mediterranean seaside. Many waved Egyptian flags or carried banners and hand-lettered signs. \"We understand, too, that a great many people have gone to Cairo to join the protests in Tahrir Square,\" Flintoff said. Ahmed Hussein, an Alexandria businessman, said his import-export trade dried up during the 18-day uprising against Mubarak, but that the cost was worth it. \"I don't know what will happen,\" he said. \"Something good for our country.\" Egypt's ambassador to the United  States, Sameh Shoukry, told NPR that he was optimistic that Egypt would see \"a new dawn of development, of stability, of democracy, of well-being.\" \"This is certainly a defining moment in the history of Egypt,\" he said. \"A small point in the very vast history of the contributions of Egypt to civilization, but a very major point in terms our future and the future development of our people.\" NPR's Lourdes Garcia-Navarro, Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson and Eric Westervelt in Cairo; Corey Flintoff in Alexandria; and Deborah Amos in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, contributed to this story, which contains material from The Associated Press",

Egyptian anti-government activists pelted police with firebombs and rocks in a second day of clashes Wednesday in defiance of an official ban on any protests. Beefed up police forces on the streets quickly moved in and used tear gas, beatings and live ammunition fired in the air to disperse any demonstrations. Security officials said more than 800 protesters have been rounded up nationwide since Tuesday, when tens of thousands turned out for the largest protests in Egypt in years \u2014 inspired by the uprising in Tunisia. They demanded an end to President Hosni Mubarak's nearly 30-year rule and a solution to grinding poverty, rising prices and high unemployment. After nightfall Wednesday, more than 2,000 demonstrators were marching on a major downtown boulevard along the Nile when dozens of riot police with helmets and shields charged the crowd. It was a scene repeated throughout the day wherever demonstrators tried to gather. Though Wednesday's demonstrations were much smaller, it was significant that protesters were able to sustain the movement over two days given the heavy-handedness police have shown and government intolerance for any more unrest. The Interior Ministry warned Wednesday that police would not tolerate any gatherings, and thousands were out on the streets poised to crack down quickly on any new signs of unrest after clashes Tuesday that killed three demonstrators and one police officer. The police cannot kill us because we, to all practical purposes, are already dead. Sami Imam, a 53-year-old retired teacher Early Wednesday, thousands of policemen in riot gear and backed by armored vehicles took up posts in Cairo on bridges across the Nile, at major intersections and squares, as well as outside key installations such as the state TV building and the headquarters of Mubarak's ruling National Democratic Party. Police fired tear gas to disperse a crowd of several hundred activists on a main commercial thoroughfare in central Cairo, chasing them through side streets as both sides pelted each other with rocks, with hundreds of onlookers watching anxiously. Officers also ordered those who lingered even for a moment in Cairo's Tahrir Square to leave. The square was the scene of the largest, occasionally bloody protests Tuesday. Thousands of people jammed the area waving banners and shouting slogans as they called for Mubarak's ouster. Some 250 people were wounded \u2014 including 85 policemen \u2014 when riot police used tear gas and batons to disperse protesters shortly after midnight. Activists used social networking sites to call for fresh demonstrations Wednesday. But authorities had shut down Twitter feeds Tuesday night, and Facebook appeared to be at least partially blocked Wednesday afternoon. In Egypt, I really can't say where this is going to go. Prince Turki al-Faisal of Saudi Arabia, raising questions about the future of Egypt's president \"All of Egypt must move, at one time,\" the Facebook group organizing the demonstrations said in a posting Wednesday in which it listed a number of spots in Cairo and around the country where demonstrators should gather. In the city of Suez east of Cairo, an angry crowd of about 1,000 people gathered outside the city's morgue demanding to take possession and bury the body of one of three protesters who died in clashes Tuesday. The crowd later clashed with riot police, and the two sides pelted each other with rocks. Protesters also threw firebombs at police, who responded with rubber bullets and tear gas. Later, about 300 protesters laid siege to a police station in the city's downtown, throwing rocks. Police responded by firing live ammunition in the air. In the southern city of Assiut, eyewitnesses said riot police set upon some 100 activists staging an anti-government protest Wednesday, beating them up with batons and arresting nearly half of them. \"Down, down Hosni Mubarak,\" chanted the crowd. \"Oh, people, join us or you will be next.\" The demonstrations were Egypt's biggest in years and are likely to fuel dissent in a presidential election year. Mubarak, 82, has yet to say whether he plans to run for another six-year term in office. He is thought to be grooming his son Gamal to succeed him, a prospect that is opposed by many Egyptians. \"Down with Hosni Mubarak, down with the tyrant,\" chanted the crowds in Cairo on Tuesday. \"We don't want you!\" One sign carried by protesters on Tuesday said: \"Gamal, take your dad and go.\" A member of Saudi Arabia's royal family raised questions about Mubarak's future amid the unprecedented protests in Cairo. \"In Egypt, I really can't say where this is going to go,\" Prince Turki al-Faisal told Reuters news agency in Davos, Switzerland. Mubarak's future depends on understanding the anger behind the protests, said al-Faisal, a former diplomat and head of Saudi intelligence who often says out loud what Arab officials say behind closed doors. The European Union said Wednesday that Egyptian authorities should listen to their people, deal with their problems and respect their right to demonstrate. The office of EU foreign affairs chief Catherine Ashton urged Egyptian authorities \"to respect and to protect the right of Egyptian citizens to manifest their political aspirations.\" The reaction from Washington,  D.C., was somewhat less assertive. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Tuesday that Egypt's government, a key U.S. ally in the Middle East, was stable and Egyptians have the right to protest, though she urged all parties to avoid violence. Nearly half of all Egyptians live under or just above the poverty line, set by the World Bank at $2 a day. The widespread poverty, high unemployment and rising food prices pose a threat to Mubarak's regime at a time when tensions between Muslims and Christians are adding to the nation's woes. \"I support change,\" said Sami Imam, a 53-year-old retired teacher who took part in Tuesday's protests. \"The police cannot kill us because we, to all practical purposes, are already dead,\" the father of four said as he clutched Egypt's red, white and black flag. \"I have not visited the butcher in six months,\" he said, referring to Egypt's rising meat prices. The protests also follow a parliamentary election marred by allegations of widespread fraud that saw Mubarak's party win all but a small number of the chamber's 518 seats. In recent weeks, Mubarak and his son have repeatedly vowed to ensure that ambitious economic reforms engineered by the younger Mubarak over the past decade filter down to the poor. But that has not happened, and there has been a marked increase in the frequency of street protests over the economy. In another parallel with Tunisia, the Egyptian protests drew energy from the death of a single young man \u2014 Khaled Said, who was beaten to death by two policemen in Alexandria last year, his family and witnesses say. His slaying has become a rallying point for Egypt's opposition. Tunisia's protests were also sparked by a single death, that of a poor Tunisian vegetable vendor who set himself on fire to protest corruption. That act has been copied by at least six people in Egypt. NPR's Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson reported from Cairo and Deborah Amos reported from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, for this story, which contains material from The Associated Press.",

The protesters, carrying flags and chanting slogans against the government, rallied in a protest inspired by the uprising in Tunisia that led to the ouster of Zine El Abidine Ben Ali. Egyptian police fired tear gas and rubber bullets and beat protesters to clear thousands of people from a central Cairo square Wednesday after the biggest demonstrations in years against President Hosni Mubarak's authoritarian rule. Two protesters and a police officer were killed in the nationwide demonstrations inspired by Tunisia's uprising, which also demanded a solution to Egypt's grinding poverty and were likely to fuel growing dissent in a presidential election year. The U.S. State Department said it was monitoring the situation closely and urged Egyptian authorities \"to handle these protests peacefully.\" \"We want to see reform occur, in Egypt and elsewhere, to create greater political, social, and economic opportunity consistent with people's aspirations,\"spokesman P.J. Crowley said in a statement. \"The United States is a partner of Egypt and the Egyptian people in this process, which we believe should unfold in a peaceful atmosphere.\" Egyptian demonstrators deface a poster of President Hosni Mubarak in Alexandria.

Thousands of protesters  marched Tuesday  in what was dubbed a \"Day of Rage\" against a lack of political freedoms under Mubarak's rule. Protesters gathered in front of the Interior Ministry building on Tuesday to voice their complaints about a multitude of issues, from a lack of government freedoms to long-term poverty. Tuesday's demonstration, the largest Egypt has seen for years, began peacefully, with police showing unusual restraint in what appeared to be a calculated strategy by the government to avoid further sullying of the image of a security apparatus already facing wide criticism. As crowds carrying Egyptian and Tunisian flags filled downtown Cairo's main Tahrir square, however, security personnel changed tactics and the protest turned violent. The scenes had particular resonance because Tuesday was also a national holiday honoring the much-feared police. \"The police have been firing tear gas and water cannons to break up the crowds,\" NPR's Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson told Morning Edition on Tuesday. \"It's pretty spectacular, in the sense that normally the police would be even more in the business of cordoning off this sort activity, and they've actually been allowing quite a bit of freedom to these demonstrators today.\" Demonstrators attacked a water cannon truck, opening the driver's door and ordering the man out of the vehicle. Some hurled rocks and dragged metal barricades. Officers beat back protesters with batons as they tried to break cordons to join the main group of demonstrators downtown. Protesters emerged stumbling from white clouds of tear gas, coughing and covering their faces with scarves. Some had blood streaming down their faces. One man fainted. Police dragged some away and beat a journalist, smashing her glasses and seizing her camera. At one point, the protesters seemed to gain the upper hand, forcing a line of riot police to flee under a barrage of rocks. One demonstrator climbed into a fire engine and drove it away. \"I want my 3-year-old child to grow up with dignity and to find a job just like the president,\" said 50-year-old Eid Attallah, who works as a driver. He said he had heard about the planned protests from friends but didn't expect them to be so big. Many expressed similar surprise. \"We are fed up; this is just enough,\" said Sayid Abdelfatah, a 38-year-old civil servant who marched with an Egyptian flag. \"Tunisia's revolution inspired me but I really never thought we would find such people ready to do the same here.\" To the north, in the Mediterranean port city of Alexandria, thousands of protesters also marched in what was dubbed a \"Day of Rage\" against Mubarak and lack of political freedoms under his rule. Like the Tunisian protests, the calls for the rallies in Egypt went out on Facebook and Twitter, with 90,000 saying they would attend. Organizers used the site to give minute-by-minute instructions on where demonstrators should go in an attempt to outmaneuver the police. By late afternoon, access to Twitter appeared to have been blocked. In another parallel with Tunisia, the protests drew energy in large part from the death of one person: a young Egyptian man named Khaled Said whose family and witnesses say was beaten to death by a pair of policemen in Alexandria last year. His case has become a rallying point for Egypt's opposition. Two policemen are on trial in connection with his death. Tunisia's protests were also sparked by the death of one man, a poor Tunisian vegetable vendor who set himself on fire to protest corruption. Last week, several people in Egypt \u2014 and elsewhere in the Middle East and North Africa \u2014 set themselves on fire in apparent attempts to copy his actions. Tuesday's protesters voiced their desperation under Egypt's many woes. \"I am not protesting the police,\" explained Radwa Qabbani, 26. \"They are citizens like me. I am protesting corruption, unemployment and high prices. We are just asking for the smallest dreams.\" Mothers carrying babies also marched and chanted, \"Revolution until Victory!\" while young waved signs reading \"OUT!\" that were inspired by the Tunisian protestations of \"DEGAGE!\" Men sprayed graffiti reading \"Down with Hosni Mubarak.\" \"We want to see change just like in Tunisia,\" said Lamia Rayan, 24, one of the protesters. Nearly half of Egypt's 80 million people live under or just above the poverty line set by the United Nations at $2 a day. Poor quality education, health care and high unemployment have left large numbers of Egyptians deprived of basic needs. The government has played down the self-immolation attempts in Egypt, with Prime Minister Ahmed Nazif telling reporters on Monday that those who committed the act were driven by \"personal issues.\" Soon after the Jan. 14 ouster of Tunisia's longtime President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, all eyes focused on Egypt, with observers wondering if the dramatic events in the North African nation could spur unrest against another entrenched Arab regime.

            "article_content": "President Obama will send his recommendations regarding his jobs proposal to the supercommittee on Monday. On Thursday, House Speaker John Boehner asked the group not to consider raising taxes to fund a jobs measure.  STEVE INSKEEP, Host: Let's talk about politics, the economy and more with NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson, who's on the line. Mara, good morning. MARA LIASSON: Good morning Steve. INSKEEP: Okay, we heard Speaker Boehner's proposals having to do with this supercommittee that's supposed to reduce the deficit. The president takes his swing at this on Monday, right? LIASSON: Right. That's right. He's going to send his recommendations to the supercommittee. The big question has been whether he would revisit the grand bargain. Grand being defined as Republicans agree to some kind of tax or revenue hikes, and Democrats agree to entitlement cuts. You just heard John Boehner rejecting that idea. And the big question is, will Obama revisit the grand bargain he tried to strike with John Boehner earlier this year? We know that he's going to offer more than $1.9 trillion in cuts to spending and tax hikes. We know that he won't touch Social Security - that was discussed with him and the speaker earlier, but he's not going to propose changes there. And the big question is whether he will propose the kinds of changes that he and the speaker were discussing in Medicare: raising the retirement age, hiking premiums for wealthier recipients. It sounds like the appetite for a grand bargain is certainly weakening elsewhere in Washington. And now the big question is how hard will the president push. INSKEEP: You just said $1.9 trillion in deficit reductions over a decade. That's actually a good deal more than the committee is required to come up with. LIASSON: Yes. INSKEEP: He's going bigger. LIASSON: Yes. Well, first of all, the committee has to come up with 1.5, but the president wants them to make sure that if they don't accept the pay-fors for his jobs plan, they find $450 billion to pay for it. And he wants them to do more than the minimum. INSKEEP: OK. So let's talk a little bit about the politics here. There were a couple of special elections this week for House seats, open House seats, both of them won by Republicans, including one in New York City where, if I'm not mistaken, Democrats outnumbered Republicans in the district 3-1 and still the Republican won that district. LIASSON: That's right. This was a real blow to Democrats. It was a heavily Democratic district, heavily Jewish district. What the Republican managed to do in that race was nationalize the race, tie the Democrat to President Obama. It was effective. It really shows that Democrats have a lot of problems going into the 2012 election. The economy is a huge drag on the Democrats, and the president is a drag on Democrats, even in this extremely Democratic district in New York. INSKEEP: And you can't be happy if you are the incumbent in the White House, whoever you are, to see a report like one that came out this week finding that one in six Americans living under the poverty line, pretty disappointing number. LIASSON: Yes, this was a 10 year study. Over 10 years the number of people in poverty have risen. We also learned that median income is now the lowest it's been since 1996. This shows you what a bad environment this is for an incumbent to run for reelection in. It's not just nine percent unemployment, it's these long-term trends. Now, of course the 10 years that this report reflected, eight of them were under Bush and two of them were under President Obama. But he does own the economy now and voters are holding him responsible even if they don't blame him for creating it. INSKEEP: Well let me ask about some of these poll numbers, Mara Liasson, because the president's approval rating remains quite bad, well south of 50 percent. And yet there was an interesting fact in a Reuters Ipsos poll today, which compared him to the Republican, leading Republicans ? Romney, Mitt Romney, and Rick Perry. And I was a little surprised to see at least in this one survey the president seemed well ahead of both of them, even though he seems to be well behind in the overall approval of the American public. LIASSON: Well, that's true, but there have been other polls that show him uncomfortably close to his potential Republican rivals, sometimes beating Mitt Romney by only a point or two, beating Rick Perry by just a couple more points. So the president can't take heart from the overall polls on this. We also saw some new polls recently from blue states that highlight the problem the president is facing among what should be his most reliable supporters. In California his approval rating is down to 50 percent. A year ago it was 61. A poll in New York showed him at only 45 percent. Another poll in New York showed support among Democrats for the president down to 67 percent. Now, that sounds pretty healthy, but it was at 86 percent previously. The president needs very strong support among his base. That is weakening too. So the problem is not just independent voters souring on the president. It's also his own base. INSKEEP: Now, in just a couple of seconds here, is Rick Perry still the Republican frontrunner after being attacked by his rivals in the last couple of debates? LIASSON: Yes, I think you'd still have to call Rick Perry the frontrunner. There's no doubt that he's taken some dents. He's under a tremendous amount of scrutiny. His record in Texas is being poured over by journalists, And some polls show the gap between his ? the way he runs against President Obama and the way Romney runs to be widening. INSKEEP: OK. LIASSON: But I still think he is the frontrunner. INSKEEP: OK. That's NPR's Mara Liasson right here on MORNING EDITION from NPR News. Copyright \u00a9 2011 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": " Princeton professor Cornel West was arrested when he spoke outside D.C. Superior Court on Oct. 17. But even as he was being led away in handcuffs, West told the crowd, \"We have no quarrel with the police. They are working people, part of the 99 percent, too.\"  Princeton professor Cornel West was arrested when he spoke outside D.C. Superior Court on Oct. 17. But even as he was being led away in handcuffs, West told the crowd, \"We have no quarrel with the police. They are working people, part of the 99 percent, too.\" Princeton University professor Cornel West has spent much of the past year battling with incensed Obama supporters from Al Sharpton to street demonstrators who resent his criticism of the president. \"He's ended up being the black mascot of the Wall Street oligarchs and corporate plutocrats!\" West has insisted in several national forums. Observations like that have earned him scorn and ad hominem remarks (\"spoilsport\" and \"Uncle Tom\" are two of the more polite ones). They've also earned him the deep disappointment of many admirers, who are proud of his prominence as one of America's most important public intellectuals but are aghast that a black man would \"attack\" the nation's first black president. A Feisty History But West has been a fighter all his life. According to his autobiography, Brother West: Living and Loving Out Loud, A Memoir, he scrapped with schoolyard bullies on behalf of weaker kids when he was a wiry boy growing up in Sacramento, Calif.  His elementary school teacher slapped him because he refused to stand and salute the flag. (He said segregation meant the flag only stood for liberty and justice for some.) So he punched her in the arm. And then he got a whipping from his father, who admired the intent but brooked no teacher-bashing.  On Oct. 7, West spoke to the crowd rallying in front of the Federal Building in downtown Los Angeles. While he was at Harvard University, West got into a verbal fight with a guest speaker from the Nation of Islam. The argument got so bad his fellow students escorted him back to his dorm, afraid for his physical safety. (He graduated, intact, magna cum laude.) When he wrote his best-selling treatise on race in America, Race Matters, he got death threats. And let's not even get into his famous dust-up with Harvard President Lawrence Summers: He didn't punch Summers in the arm when he questioned West's scholarship, but West did tell the press afterward that Summers had tangled with \"the wrong Negro.\" (West left to become a tenured professor at Princeton, where he remains. He's on sabbatical this year.) So the ire now directed at him because he's touring the country with his colleague Tavis Smiley, saying Barack Obama has been derelict in his duty to the nation's poor, isn't keeping West up nights. Being Misunderstood 'Goes With The Territory, Sometimes' \"It can be painful when you're misunderstood,\" he admitted before he and Smiley held a town hall on poverty in Los Angeles' oldest synagogue. \"But that's all right. Sometimes it goes with the territory.\" It can be painful when you're misunderstood. But that's all right. Sometimes it goes with the territory. Cornel West West has further angered many in the black community for joining with Ralph Nader to encourage third-party candidates to challenge Obama during the Democratic primaries.  L.A. community activist Najee Ali was so angry, he organized a protest where demonstrators marched outside Smiley's studios, chanting that he and West should \"stop the hate.\" \"We're very disappointed with Dr. West,\" Ali said, holding up an Obama 2012 placard as passing motorists blew their horns in support. \"This teaming up with Ralph Nader could take on a life of its own \u2014 doesn't he remember where that got the country when Nader ran against Gore?\" For his part, West fully expects Obama to be re-elected. But he wants there to be some \"robust conversation and debate within the Democratic primary\" so the president doesn't \"end up with just uncritical adulation, rather than critical interrogation.\" Being Everywhere At Once West and Smiley have been joining the \"occupy\" movement all over the place \u2014 Wall Street, Boston, Los Angeles and D.C., where he was arrested in front of the Supreme Court for (what else?) demonstrating for the need for the poor to be more visible on the American agenda. And showing solidarity with what they say are the 99 percent of the nation whose financial welfare is controlled by a powerful 1 percent. Even as he was being led away in handcuffs by D.C. police, West told the crowd, \"We have no quarrel with the police. They are working people, part of the 99 percent, too.\" West's sabbatical year will be over at some point, but even when it ends, his advocacy for the poor \u2014 for those he calls \"the least among us\" \u2014 will continue. And he is guaranteed to anger Obama supporters as he continues to call out the president on his poverty policy, or lack thereof.  But it's the only thing West can see himself doing. \"You have to try to be true to yourself, even as you're open to criticisms,\" he says. And the self he is defies categorization: elite academician, intellectual entrepreneur, anti-poverty crusader, lover of Schopenhauer and Stevie Wonder. And unwilling to give any of it up.",

            "article_content": "This week, House Speaker Boehner acknowledged some common ground between his jobs plan and the president's plan, but said Obama's program doesn't quite add up. Also, the U.S. Census Bureau reported the latest poverty figures, and  Tyler Perry was reported as the highest paid man in Hollywood. GUESTS: author Jimi Izrael, civil rights attorney Arsalan Iftikhar, film critic Wesley Morris and columnist Mario Loyola.  MICHEL MARTIN, Host: Now, it's time for our weekly visit to the Barber Shop, where the guys talk about what's in the news and what's on their minds. Sitting in their chairs for our shape-up this week are author, Jimi Izrael; civil rights attorney and editor, Arsalan Iftikhar; film critic, Wesley Morris; and Mario Loyola. He writes for the National Review and he works for the Texas Public Policy Foundation. That's a conservative think tank that favors a limited role for government. Take it away, Jimi. JIMI IZRAEL: Thanks, Michel. Hey, fellows, welcome to the shop. How we doing? ARSALAN IFTIKHAR: Hey, hey, hey. WESLEY MORRIS: I'm fine. I actually do need a shape-up, actually. IZRAEL: Wild, wild Wes. MORRIS: I really need to get one of those. IZRAEL: Wild, wild Wes. Welcome to the shop. First time in. Good to have you. All right. MORRIS: Nice to be here. IZRAEL: All right. Well, let's get things started with what everyone's talking about, but no one knows exactly where to find: jobs. Now, the president delivered his $450 billion job proposal last week. Two congressmen - yesterday, House Speaker John Boehner said, while there's some common ground between his and the president's plan, Obama's job program doesn't quite add up. So you mean they don't get along? They don't agree on something, Michel? Clutch the pearls. MARTIN: I know. Clutch the pearls. Clutch the pearls. IZRAEL: News at 11. MARTIN: I'm going to play a little clip of speaker Boehner's remarks at the Economic Club of Washington, DC. I know we played a clip earlier, you know, but the president's speech is carried on, you know, networks and got a lot of attention, so I think it's OK to play another clip of Speaker Boehner's speech. Here it is. IZRAEL: Drop it. JOHN BOEHNER, Host: It strikes me as odd that at a time when it's clear the tax code needs to be fundamentally reformed. The first instinct to come out of Washington is to come up with a new host of tax credits that make the tax code more complex. IZRAEL: Wow. Thanks for that, Michel. I mean, like, what do you say to that? Right? But - OK. For me, personally, and a lot of my friends, it's really the African American college educated black male that seems to be taking the recession hardest on the chin. Look, I know he's everybody's president. You don't have to tell me that. But it just seems to me that, while other groups of people, you know, white folks in general and black women - they're doing OK. Black men are taking it the hardest on the chin. Like myself, you know, and of course, it could be regional. Like I'm in the Midwest now and you guys have heard the story, but I've had headhunters suggest to me to take my master's degree off of my resume, you know, because the burger flippers are winning, the people with high school diplomas and stuff like that. Those cats are winning. Those cats are getting overtime, but... MARTIN: I don't think that's accurate. It is a fact that black college educated men are twice as likely to be unemployed as white college educated men. IZRAEL: OK. MARTIN: But their unemployment rate, overall, is far lower than people with less education. Mario, I think that's... IZRAEL: I'm just... MARIO LOYOLA: Their income is much higher. MARTIN: Yeah. So... IZRAEL: OK. All right. MARTIN: But, I mean, that doesn't change the fact that - how frustrating it is when you feel you've done everything right. You've done everything that this society has asked you to do, which is get your education,... IZRAEL: Right. MARTIN: ...you know, demonstrate mastery over something and you still aren't making headway. I totally credit how frustrating that has to be. IZRAEL: Wild Wes. MARTIN: Yeah. IZRAEL: Jump in here. MORRIS: You know, on some level, you know, it's funny looking at the numbers and then trying to figure out what they mean and how they persist the way they do. I feel like it doesn't make a good situation for the president, insofar as, you know, sort of what we're talking about a little bit or the ongoing conversation we have about him is, whose president is he? But this isn't just - I mean, one of the things about those numbers is that they fit really neatly if, you know, disturbingly, within the larger numbers of poverty in this country and how hard it is - and how endemic it is and how hard it is to overcome. And it just is kind of weirdly insulting to see Boehner - just seemed to be - I mean, every time I see him, I feel like he's like the villain in a Batman movie. You know, one of these guys... IZRAEL: Which one, man? You got to be specific. MORRIS: Just take your pick. I mean, you... IZRAEL: The Riddler? MORRIS: The idea is to sort of - I don't know what the outcome is supposed to be for these - you know, for the president to sort of propose something and then John Boehner on the other side sort of says, wait a minute. Wait a minute. In a time when people are unemployed and da, da, da, da, the president wants to offer all these things that he can't really do, so I'm going to offer some things that I can't really do, either - just to sort of prolong doing anything. IZRAEL: OK. Well, the Riddler it is. OK. Wait. Hold on. Can we get super Mario in here? What do you think of Boehner's plan? LOYOLA: Yeah. MORRIS: He is the Riddler, actually. LOYOLA: By the way, this is - I'm taking a break from my duties as the Barber Shop's ambassador to the Austin City Limits Festival, just to tell you that... MARTIN: I know, you're a good man. LOYOLA: Look, what we're looking at is two completely different visions of government, OK? Boehner is not opposing the president just to oppose the president. I mean we - the conservatives really believe that the problem here, the reason why jobs aren't being created is because the regulatory and tax burden on businesses is overwhelming. Between the Sarbanes-Oxley law and that Dodd-Frank law, London has become the world's financial capital instead of New York. We've got companies relocating to other countries to avoid the corporate tax burden in the United States, which is the highest in the developed world. We've got oil companies moving to Switzerland from Texas because of the income tax rate in Texas. Now what sense does it make to - you're taxing all these companies at 20 percent and then you raise the tax to 35 percent and now they're gone, and now you're getting no tax revenue. I mean and people keep following these policies. I mean look, government is not the solution. And that's the argument that we have with Obama, and it's a legitimate argument. IZRAEL: A-Train. IFTIKHAR: Well, you know, I'm going to go rogue like Sarah Palin here and say that... IZRAEL: Uh oh. IFTIKHAR: ...that this is nothing more than political gamesmanship. You know, the Republicans seem to be willing to keep millions of Americans out of work just to kick one man out of a job in 2012. You know, we talk, you know, Boehner and the Republicans talk about taxes like it's the silver bullet, it's the Holy Grail solution to everything. And, you know, Mario is right that, you know, when corporations are taxed at a 20 percent tax rate or a 35 percent tax, what he fails to mention is that because of our current tax loopholes they virtually pay nothing in taxes. And so, you know, when Boehner and the Republicans use terms like, you know, small, you know, business owners, I mean there's essentially talking about rich people. I mean this is code for people who make $250,000 plus a year. It's not for the 9.1 percent of Americans who are currently unemployed. Again, this is just political gamesmanship. They are the obstructionist party right now. If Obama came up with a plan to say that the sky is blue, they'd find a way to say no to that as well. LOYOLA: Yeah, I'll be sending A-Train an e-mail with some data, because... (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER) LOYOLA: ...the top 20 percent of income earners pay 80 percent of all taxes. MARTIN: Well, you know, I credit that this is, these are - first of all let me just say I am grateful to live in a country where competing - sharply competing - visions of government are resolved at the ballot box and not at the point of a gun. IFTIKHAR: Right. MARTIN: But, so, I think that we are could say... IFTIKHAR: Hoorah. LOYOLA: Here. Here. MARTIN: Having said that, I do ask, you know, how does this get resolved? Because, you know, voters elected President Obama for his vision. They also elected the current Congress for their vision. So how does this get resolved when they really are kind of staring at each other across this divide and nobody - and they do have - let's just say, let's just credit that this really is about competing economic visions, as opposed to about ego and just wanting to aggregate power for your side and go team. How does it get resolved? How does it get... MORRIS: That's very generous, Michel. IZRAEL: Yeah, I was going to say. IFTIKHAR: Yeah, it really is very generous. (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER) MARTIN: Well, but how does it get, but the fact is, but if you do have a profoundly different vision, you have as much right to advance it as the guy who you don't agree with, right. So what happens? What's supposed to happen here? But what about - Mario, I'll just give you the last word on this. What about what the president said is just let's credit that everybody just that these are honestly and sincerely held competing visions, but it's 14 months until the next presidential election. What's supposed to happen in the meantime? LOYOLA: Well, it's a competition between how many people believe in the president's vision and how many people believe in the conservative vision. And this is not, you know, the president is not - I sincerely believe he's a smart person, an ethical person, he's trying to be a good leader, but he's not new left. You know, he's not like Bill Clinton. He's not like Tony Blair. He's old left. You know, and people, it's funny to me. People lay charges of racism against the Tea Party and stuff, but the American - the English speaker that conservatives cannot stand is Jimmy Carter, and this president is starting to remind people of Jimmy Carter, and that's the problem we're facing. And so... MARTIN: OK. LOYOLA: ...you see stories of the president losing support in his own base, and meanwhile, the conservatives are increasingly, you know, are increasingly - you think it's about personality and stuff? The conservatives think they're fighting for the future of the country. MARTIN: Well, OK. IFTIKHAR: Well, Mario... MARTIN: Arsalan, final thought on this? IFTIKHAR: Yeah. I mean, but conservatives, you know, didn't call Jimmy Carter a crypto Muslim Manchurian candidate, you know, who is secretly born in Kenya. I mean? LOYOLA: Just a traitor, but whatever. IZRAEL: They called him a simple peanut farmer that didn't know how to run the country. You know... IFTIKHAR: Right. But you can't deny there has been a racialist element when there's 29 percent of Americans who still believe to this day that President Obama is a Muslim. I mean there is a racialist element here that is hard to deny. MARTIN: Can I just ask one thing before we go on to other stuff that we want to talk about? I still, you know, how Secretary Gates - Bob Gates - the defense secretary recently retired, said that one of the things that bothered him is that people seem to have a less and less of a connection to the military. When these poverty numbers came out, I kind of wondered the same thing about that. And I wondered whether is it that people have less and less of a connection to people who are actually living in poverty, so therefore it's harder for people to empathize? I don't know. What are people think about this? LOYOLA: It's the new segregation, Michel. MORRIS: Yes. Yes. Yes. I think that's absolutely... MARTIN: Wesley, you think so? MORRIS: Absolutely. Absolutely. Absolutely. I think that it makes me - I feel on some level, there's a really good movie called her \"The Interrupters,\" it's out right now, that's about the attempt to sort of make gang violence less endemic than it - or it's like violence in general in Chicago less endemic than it actually is. What astonished me about the movie is how A, you don't really ever see poor people in movies and how this movie sort of says a lot about America in general, and how much of America we don't see and acknowledge when we talk about numbers. I mean we should try to - when these numbers come out I think it'd be really helpful for somebody to try to put faces with these numbers and voices with these numbers and to try to think more about what they mean for people's actual daily lives. I mean we're, the government is so far, or the federal government and these conversations about those numbers and economic plans are so far from the people they actually affect. If there was some way to cut the space in half or remove it so that Boehner and Obama are more directly, more obviously talking to the people whose lives they would affect or these policies, whose lives these policies would affect, it would make a huge difference, I think, in terms of the way these messages play out. LOYOLA: Well, let's think about the poverty numbers that came out this week, right? We have 45 million people in the United States that are below the poverty line. Now the poverty line is $22,300 or something, it's what three times what you need to feed a family of four. Now think about this for a second. If you live in Houston and you're a single parent in a family of four and you work as a cashier at the supermarket, making $11 an hour, you're above the poverty line. Your household is above the poverty line. So you have 45 million people in this country living - basically what are we looking at? We're looking at single-parent homes, single mother homes where the mother either doesn't work or works only part time. That's the vast majority of the households that are below the poverty line. And that demographic of 45 million people in which you have a single mother who is unemployed or underemployed did not even exist in the 1960s. This was created by the welfare programs of the 1960s. MARTIN: OK. Well, that's a whole other conversation, Mario, because - that's a whole other conversation. LOYOLA: Yeah. MARTIN: If you're just joining us, this is TELL ME MORE from NPR News. I'm Michel Martin. We're having our weekly Barbershop conversation with Mario Loyola, that's who you just heard. Also with us, Jimi Izrael, and Arsalan Iftikhar, and Wesley Morris. Back to you, Jimi IZRAEL: Thanks, Michel. All right. Well, moving on from people making very little money to a guy making lots and lots and lots of cheddar. MARTIN: Fat bank. IZRAEL: This is who is making the most cash in Hollywood these days. (SOUNDBITE OF MOVIE, \"MADEA GOES TO JAIL\") TYLER PERRY: (as Madea) I guess nobody told you that I'm Madea. Ma to the damn d-e-a. You understand that? And what I want I get. Do you understand me? I'm from the West End. That's where we cut a fool first and run like hell afterwards. You understand? You don't know me. You don't know the hell you talking to. IZRAEL: Wow it sounds like Madea is from Chicago. Thanks for that. (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER) MARTIN: Is it OK if I laugh? IZRAEL: What. MARTIN: Is it OK if I laugh? IZRAEL: Now wait a second. Now... MARTIN: You can revoke my cold card. (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER) IZRAEL: Hold on. Hold on a second. Now Tyler Perry, he's been criticized by the black American community for creating foolish movies that make black folks look silly, but look, I'm not a huge fan of his but I respect his ability to craft stories with niche appeal that guarantee him an audience every time out. You know, all right, \"For Colored Girls\" notwithstanding. Like he's not an auteur and he's never claimed to be. He's a businessman and once you realize that, his films become a lot easier to stomach. Wes. Wild Wes. MARTIN: Well, now that you've told us how we should feel about this, Jimi, thank you. Let me just give the numbers here. (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER) MARTIN: The actor, writer, director, producer raked in $130 million from May of 2010 two 2011. \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" producer Jerry Bruckheimer took second place, and Steven Spielberg ranked third. IZRAEL: Thanks, Michel. MARTIN: Sure. LOYOLA: He didn't do anything. (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER) IZRAEL: Wild Wes, you want to kick in? MARTIN: He's Steven Spielberg. He doesn't have to do anything. (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER) MARTIN: Wesley, tell me... MORRIS: You know... MARTIN: Is it OK that we laughed? MORRIS: I, you know, Michel, you and I have had this conversation about Tyler Perry a few times. I, you know, initially when it was unclear what he wanted to get from the movie-going audience, becoming a filmmaker, a nominal filmmaker, I was skeptical. But I have to say that I mean, this is not a Tyler Perry problem, our problem with Tyler. This is a problem with the entertainment industry. And it's bigger than Tyler Perry insofar as he can't do it by himself. Do you know what I mean? It's not as though with Tyler Perry has come these great opportunities for other black artists to sort of get a piece of the American movie-going audience. He has become a business and a phenomenon unto himself and he employs a lot of people who don't get work - who don't get enough work.

I mean... IZRAEL: Moprah. (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER) MARTIN: No. No. But he, no, he's done something different than Oprah because he's created...

(SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER) IFTIKHAR: No. I mean just to be an entity, I mean he's an institution and you've got to respect the hustle. He keeps pushing. IZRAEL: Yeah. MARTIN: What ? Mario, have you ever seen any of his movies? Mario... LOYOLA: No, I have not. MARTIN: You have not? LOYOLA: The last movie I saw was \"Chinatown\" by Roman Polanski, so I'm still...

At that dinner, he said the federal government is rudderless. Now, he's calling for a \"day of prayer and fasting on behalf of our nation.\"\n                \n                    \n                    Gregory Bull/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Rick Perry, the longest-serving governor of Texas, is a Methodist by tradition who, with his wife, Anita, now attends an evangelical megachurch in Austin. He is open about his deep Christian faith. On Saturday, Perry, who is widely expected to enter the race for the White House, is hosting a religious revival in Houston to pray for what he calls \"a nation in crisis.\" While the governor claims it's nothing more than a Christian prayer rally, the event has touched off a holy war among critics, who claim it is Jesus-exclusive and political. 'We Need God's Help' Late last year, shortly after he won his third term, Perry, a Republican, began to envision the event that is now called \"The Response.\" \"With the economy in trouble, communities in crisis, people adrift in a sea of moral relativism, we need God's help,\" he said. \"And that's why I'm calling on Americans to pray and fast like Jesus did.\" An event spokesman, who is a former Perry speechwriter, says the daylong affair will be filled with prayer, inspirational messages, Scripture readings and praise music. More than 8,000 people have registered for the prayer rally, which is being held in the 71,000-seat Reliant Stadium, normally used for rodeos and NFL games. Perry invited all his fellow governors. The only one to accept was Sam Brownback of Kansas, but he is now backing away. His office says Brownback is \"on vacation,\" and if he goes, \"it's at his discretion and on his dime.\" Among prominent religious leaders expected to speak: James Dobson, founder of Focus on the Family and now a radio broadcaster; Richard Land of the Southern Baptist Convention, and Tony Perkins of the Family Research Council. Perry is not scheduled to address the crowd. 'The Fringe Of The Fringe' Other names on the list of coordinators and endorsers have raised eyebrows. \"I mean, when you talk about the religious right, this is the fringe of the fringe here,\" says Dan Quinn, communications director of the Texas Freedom Network, an Austin-based watchdog group that tracks the far right in Texas. \"This is clearly, when you look at it, religious extremism and naked partisan politics,\" Quinn says. \"I think it's one of the most cynical displays of using faith as a political tool we've seen in a long time.\" This is clearly, when you look at it, kind of a combination of religious extremism and naked partisan politics ... I think it's probably one of the most cynical displays of using faith as a political tool that we've seen in a long time. Dan Quinn, of the Texas Freedom Network The event is being paid for by the American Family Association, which describes itself as being \"on the frontlines of America's culture war.\" The Southern Poverty Law Center characterizes the AFA as a hate group because of its fierce anti-gay agenda. Among the participants: -- John Hagee, a San   Antonio evangelist whose endorsement was rejected by John McCain in 2008 because of Hagee's anti-Catholic statements. -- Mike Bickle, a founder of the International House of Prayer in Kansas City, Mo., who has called Oprah Winfrey a \"pastor of the harlot of Babylon.\" -- Alice Patterson, founder of Justice at the Gate, in San Antonio, who has written that there is \"a demonic structure behind the Democratic Party.\" -- And then there's John Benefiel, head of the Oklahoma-based Heartland Apostolic Prayer Network, who once said this about the Statue of Liberty: \"You know where we got it from? French Freemasons. Listen, folks, that is an idol, a demonic idol right there in the middle of New York Harbor.\" A Rush To Judgment? The gathering in Houston appears to some observers as an early attempt to line up the support of conservative evangelicals for Perry's expected presidential run. The event's executive committee includes religious/political activists David Lane and Jim Garlow, as well as Wayne Hamilton and David Barton, both former officials of the Texas Republican Party. But wait, organizers say: Don't condemn an event before it happens. \"We do need to come together, and pray, and to seek the Lord on behalf of our nation,\" says Doug Stringer, who runs a Christian world outreach ministry in Houston called Somebody Cares. \"If we can do that without being against anything, then I [am] pleased to be a part of it.\" Stringer says he agreed to be an organizer if they guaranteed there will no long-winded sermons or political speeches. \"And so as a result, they've allowed me to be a prayer captain, and if anything goes off-track to where I feel it should be focused on the Lord and prayer and worship, I can come to the microphone and kind of give redirection to it.\" Yet \"The Response\" remains divisive. Earlier this week, 50 Houston religious leaders, led by the Anti-Defamation League, signed a letter expressing their concern that the Texas governor, and possible presidential candidate, is \"sending an official message of religious exclusion\" to non-Christian Texans. An event spokesman insists that everyone is welcome.",

Read Another Opinion On Obama's Campaign When Barack Obama took the stage in Osawatomie,  Kansas, on December 6, there was no talk about \"change we can believe in\" or \"we're the ones we've been waiting for\" or even any mention of \"hope.\" Gone were the slogans and good vibes from 2008 that promised transcendence to a higher, less partisan plane of existence. Instead there was real talk: about how the \"basic bargain that made this country great has eroded,\" about the \"breathtaking greed of a few,\" about how \"the typical CEO who used to earn about thirty times more than his or her worker now earns 110 times more,\" and about how the nation is facing a \"make-or-break moment for the middle class.\" The president called out the Republicans, whose deregulatory, anti-tax mania brought us the \"you're on your own\" economy and whose solution to the crisis is more of the same. Perhaps most important, he made an argument about inequality \u2014 not just on moral terms, although there was plenty of that, but on economic ones as well. As long as middle-class Americans can't buy the goods and services that businesses are selling, he explained, the entire economy will drag. It was the speech Obama should have given years ago; it took the Occupy movement to make him do it. Some may worry that Obama is trying to co-opt Occupy in an election year. We say \u2014 let him try. The fact that the president's speechwriters are cribbing from Occupy's handmade posters is just one more indication of the movement's major victory so far: it has changed the national conversation, giving us a new vocabulary, the 99 percent. If this framing succeeds, its impact will surpass any one speech, or even any one president's re-election. It will be the paradigm within which all politicians will be judged \u2014 what have you done for the 99 percent? This framework has already scored a win in New York, birthplace of the Occupy movement, where after months of maneuvering against progressives and catering to Wall Street, Governor Andrew Cuomo reversed course and partially restored a millionaire's tax he had pledged to let expire in his campaign. The outcome is not ideal \u2014 the new tax raises less money than the one it replaces, and grave budget cuts still loom \u2014 but what's worth celebrating here is how established progressive groups worked alongside Occupy to break Cuomo's will, tarring him as \"Governor 1 Percent\" [see \"Noted\"]. In the end, it was a label he couldn't bear and sustained pressure he couldn't withstand. If Obama is to avoid becoming President 1 Percent, he'll have to take up more than Occupy's language. He'll have to change the conditions that have so immiserated and enraged the 99 percent. The president's Kansas speech was a welcome sign that he's willing to draw a few hard lines, but he could show where he stands by acting swiftly to back legislation that restores economic fairness, even if it will fail this time around. The most ambitious agenda on the table is the omnibus \"American Dream\" legislation from the Congressional Progressive Caucus (CPC), which would put 5.4 million Americans to work in two years. The bill would also create a National Infrastructure Development Bank and shore up Social Security and Medicare. It would raise revenue and reduce the deficit by more than $2 trillion over ten years by ending the war in Afghanistan, introducing a speculation tax, eliminating subsidies for Big Oil and raising taxes on the 1 percent. The CPC bill isn't perfect, but in an atmosphere stunted by a misguided Beltway obsession with deficits, it's the best thing going. If the president doesn't move in its direction, we will face continued high unemployment, declining wages, spreading poverty and deepening inequality. Yes, we can do better.",

Read Another Opinion On Egypt's Elections Mohamed El Dahshan is an economic consultant and blogger. Egypt's elections weren't supposed to be this way. Our first \"post-revolution\" (sigh...) elections were supposed to be free. The overwhelmingly young people who led the January and February uprising would lead the nation into a future of freedom and justice, a nation for all its citizens, equal before the law. People would work together to eradicate corruption, poverty, sexual harassment, discrimination, petty crime \u2014 traffic, even. The sky seemed to be the limit. Today is the Icarian crash landing. I wasn't supposed to hear a candidate talk about \"courting the Christian lobby's vote\" or some acquaintances talk about voting for the Muslim Brotherhood because they want someone \"who can stand up to the Christians who want to take over the country.\" These elections weren't supposed to occur as we suffer under the military boot \u2014 one that even the most committed revolutionaries among us have no clear idea how to remove. One that has handpicked a 78-year old former Mubarak-era prime minister who, as I write, is reported to be mulling the re-appointment of a number of ministers who were in office when the January 25th revolution began. They shouldn't be taking place as families bury children who died over the course of the past week, when clashes with the army-backed police forces killed over 40 and injured more than 1,000 protesters who have demanded the end of the military rule and an immediate transfer of power to a civilian government. They shouldn't occur while bloggers like Alaa Abdel Fattah, Maikel Nabil, and scores of other civilian prisoners unjustly languish in military jails on trumped-up charges. On Sunday, the day before the elections, Alaa's case was referred to an ad hoc \"emergency\" court and his detention was extended by a further 15 days, while Maikel, on his 99th day of a hunger strike, saw his retrial further postponed to Dec. 4. He currently survives on milk and juice. Debates among activists who led the revolutionary movement about whether the election would legitimize military rule and whether to boycott had been raging for days before polls opened Monday. (My take: it might, yes; and no, I am not boycotting, though I hesitated long and hard.) I did not want to vote, but felt I had to. After a sleepless night, I went to vote Monday morning, and stood in line for three hours, during which I witnessed a series of violations. Continue reading at Foreign Policy.",

Protesters with the 'Occupy Wall Street' movement demonstrate before walking up 5th Avenue to rally in front of the residence of NewsCorp CEO Rupert Murdoch on Oct. 11, 2011 in New York City. Read Another Opinion About Occupy Wall Street John Nichols has written the Beat for The Nation since 1999. How did Occupy Wall Street suddenly become Occupy Los Angeles? Occupy Cleveland? Occupy Janesville? Occupy Pocatello? How did a sleep-in beneath the skyscrapers of Lower Manhattan inspire kayakers clad as Robin Hood to paddle up the Chicago River under a banner reading, Wall St. Takes From the 99%. Gives to the Rich? And how did those giant cutouts of JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon end up dancing with all those San Franciscans chanting, \"Make banks pay\"? Despite what Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain suggests, it was not some \"orchestrated\" attempt to deflect blame from the flawed policies of the Obama administration. It was not the media looking for a \"left-wing Tea Party.\" And it certainly was not a poll-tested, focus-grouped PR campaign that billionaire-funded front groups employ to gin up movements. Occupy Wall Street started small, took a beating from the cops and struggled for weeks to get the attention of the political class, the media and even its own natural allies. The only thing going for this unlikely intervention has been the pitch-perfect resonance of its founding premises. The American people understood Occupy Wall Street, and began to embrace its promise, long before the mandarins who presume to chart our national discourse noticed that everything was changing. That's because the generators of this movement\u2014and it is a movement\u2014have gotten three things right from the start: The target is right. This has been a year of agitation, from Wisconsin to Ohio to Washington. It has seen some of the largest demonstrations in recent American history in defense of labor rights, public education, public services. But all those uprisings attacked symptoms of the disease. Occupy Wall Street named it. By aiming activism not at the government but at the warren of bankers, CEOs and hedge-fund managers to whom the government is beholden, Occupy Wall Street went to the heart of the matter. And that captured the imagination of Americans who knew Michael Moore was right when he finished his 2009 documentary Capitalism: A Love Story with an attempted citizen's arrest of the bankers who not only avoided accountability after crashing the economy but profited from a taxpayer-funded bailout. Like the populists, the socialists and the best of the progressive reformers of a century ago, Occupy Wall Street has not gotten distracted by electoral politics; it has gone after the manipulator of both major parties\u2014what the radicals of old referred to as \"the money power.\" The numbers are right. If Thomas Frank's What's the Matter With Kansas? taught us anything, it was that the great accomplishment of the money power in contemporary politics has been to divide the overwhelming mass of Americans over social and cultural issues, thus deflecting attention from fundamental economic debates. The brilliance of Occupy Wall Street's message, \"We are the 99 percent,\" is that it invites just about everyone who isn't a billionaire to recognize themselves as members of the class that has suffered what Thomas Jefferson once described as \"a long train of abuses and usurpations.\" For all the efforts of Wall Street's media and political defenders to dismiss the persistent protesters as somehow un-American, the vast majority of Americans recognize that kids in sleeping bags did not shutter this country's factories, mangle our mortgage markets or create a pay-to-play system. The 99 percent did not ask for or approve a system that always has money for wars and bank bailouts but won't, as former Congressman Alan Grayson notes, help the 24 million Americans who can't find full-time work, the 50 million Americans who can't see a doctor when they're sick, the 47 million Americans who need government aid to feed themselves, the 15 million American families who owe more on their mortgages than their homes are worth. The demands are right. The most comic complaint about Occupy Wall Street\u2014not just from critics but even from some elite sympathizers\u2014is that it lacks well-defined demands. In fact, the objection of the occupiers to a system of corporate domination and growing inequality, and their desire to change that system, makes a lot more sense to a lot more Americans than anything being said by politicians. Polling confirms this point: Barack Obama's approval ratings are dismal, but the approval ratings for the Republicans in Congress are dramatically worse. The American people desperately wanted this movement. That is proven not only by the polls but by the practical embrace of the Occupy Wall Street ethos in more than a thousand communities across the nation. Some are already occupying public spaces, others are marching and rallying. Beyond Wall Street, there will be more specific complaints, more adventurous alliances, more practical politics, but there's no reason why a diversity of issues and tactics cannot build the movement that was invited when the call to Occupy Wall Street was issued. The key word is \"invited.\" The genius of Occupy Wall Street is that it is not a traditional political project. It did not arrive with a set of talking points and an organizing template. Its evolution has already taken it far from where it began, physically or politically. Its alliance with unions and other progressive groups will in all likelihood transform the movement as it spreads across the country, just as the movement has the potential to transform its allies. There will be ongoing occupations, but there's also the prospect of countrywide\u2014indeed, worldwide\u2014days of action, like the one planned for October 29, in American capital cities and cities around the world, the weekend before the G-20 summit in France. The prospect of massive demonstrations like the 1969 anti\u2013Vietnam War Moratorium, the immigrant rights demonstrations of 2006 and last winter's mobilizations in and outside the Capitol in Madison, Wisconsin, has already unsettled mainstream politicians and the pundit class that serves as their stenographers. New York Congressman Peter King told right-wing radio host Laura Ingraham, \"It's really important for us not to be giving any legitimacy to these people in the streets.... I'm old enough to remember what happened in the 1960s, when the left wing takes to the streets and somehow the media glorifies them, and it ends up shaping policy. We can't allow that to happen.\" But it is happening. That's exhilarating, and necessary. Our political culture, as dysfunctional as it is disappointing, will change only if those in power feel threatened by movements that are impossible to manage. Already, the reactions to the threat are clarifying. The Republican Party, with rare exceptions, has rallied to defend the banksters, with Representative Paul Ryan fretting about \"sowing class envy\" and Representative Eric Cantor warning that Americans might become a \"mob.\" Democrats have been more nuanced. President Obama says he understands the frustration of the protesters, and since advancing his jobs bill in September, he has moved in a more populist direction. But he still promotes free-trade deals that will exacerbate the unemployment crisis, which fuels so much of the 99 percenters' frustration. Other Democrats have been more consistent. Members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus and the Congressional Black Caucus have been predictably warm in their embrace of a populist movement that strengthens their hand in party debates, and House minority leader Nancy Pelosi has risen repeatedly to defend the protesters, declaring, \"I support the message to the establishment, whether it's Wall Street or the political establishment and the rest, that change has to happen. We cannot continue in a way that is not relevant to their lives.\" Pelosi's stance is commendable, yet it is an inadequate counter to the nearly universal Republican demand for more tax cuts, privatization, raging income inequality and healthcare policies that tell the poor to die quickly. The Democratic Party is anything but united on behalf of a fair economy. In 2008, when everyone was ready to end the Bush era, Obama could cobble together a broad coalition to win the presidency. But that won't work now that the battle lines are drawn. \"This is no time to hang back,\" says former Senator Russ Feingold. \"One of the biggest problems Democrats have is that they forget the power and the passion that the base of the party has.\" The president can no longer satisfy both the CEOs (some of whom will see him as their best defense against the rabble) and the single moms; if he tries, the single moms will run out of patience. So it is that the Occupy Wall Street movement might well develop into a virtual primary challenge to Obama. Instead of coasting to renomination, the president could find himself confronted by protests from Iowa to New  Hampshire to Nevada to California\u2014protests that would require him to move to the left just as a credible primary challenger might have done, protests that could make next year's Democratic convention in Charlotte more than just a coronation. Getting Obama to take the side of 99 percent of Americans is smart politics for the Democrats. But that ought not to be the goal of the Occupy Wall Street movement. This fight is too important to be about one politician, one party or one election. \"Some people say we are the Tea Party for the Democratic Party,\" said Emilio Baez, a 17-year-old high school student who joined the Occupy Chicago protests. \"That's bullshit. We are the working class for a mass movement of democracy.\" Baez is right. America needs a new politics, as much of the streets as the polling place, a politics that, like the labor movement of the 1930s, the civil rights and antiwar movements of the 1960s, the environmental movement of the early 1970s, forces both parties to transform. Anything less is more of the same\u2014more poverty, more inequality, more economic injustice. And if Occupy Wall Street is anything at all, it is a shout from the 99 percenters: \"We have had it!\"",

But King Abdullah II of Jordan, who is among the world leaders at the United Nations this week, also sees opportunities. \"In certain countries, you're going to see revolution after revolution, until it calms down,\" the king tells Morning Edition co-host Steve Inskeep. \"What we're trying to do in Jordan is [to] do evolution.\" In Jordan, street protests have been limited compared with other nations in the region, but they prompted Abdullah, 49, to promise changes in the constitution that will allow his subjects to elect a prime minister and other officials. During his visit to New York City, the Jordanian monarch spoke about the Arab Spring and the increasing calls for the United Nations to recognize a Palestinian state. On Israel, and Palestinians' Push for Statehood \"The bid by the Palestinians for statehood [as recognized by the U.N.] came out of desperation and frustration, because nothing was happening on the negotiation table. We could see this coming from several months ago. Obviously, certain countries had raised their concerns about the Palestinian bid. Our response has been, 'Well, let's then make an effort to get the Israelis and Palestinians to sit around the table.' That hasn't happened. So we only have ourselves to blame for this crisis.\" King Abdullah II speaks to Jordan's royal reform committee after receiving plans to alter his country's Constitution, during a ceremony at Raghadan Palace in Amman on Aug. 14.\n                \n                    \n                    Nader Daoud/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption King Abdullah II speaks to Jordan's royal reform committee after receiving plans to alter his country's Constitution, during a ceremony at Raghadan Palace in Amman on Aug. 14. On Turkey's recent downgrade of relations with Israel, and whether Jordan may follow suit \"We have, as you mention, peace with Israel. We're actually the last man standing. So, there is going to be immense pressure and people asking, 'Why are we having this relationship, when it's not benefiting anybody?' Obviously, my answer is, you always benefit from peace. But ... we have seen no intention from the other side to try and move the process forward ... \"There are going to be a lot of questions, not just in my country but across the Middle East: Is Israel going to continue to be 'Fortress Israel' \u2014 or, as we all hope, become accepted into the neighborhood? Which I believe is the only way we can move forward in harmony. And no matter what's happening in the Middle East \u2014 the Arab Spring, et cetera, the economic challenges, high rates of unemployment \u2014 the emotional, critical issue is always the Israeli-Palestinian one.\" On the Arab Spring \"What bothers me in a lot of countries is [that] society is being led by the street, as opposed to the light at the end of the tunnel. But we have got to remember that the Arab Spring began \u2014 and there's challenges all over the world, including your country \u2014 because of economic difficulties: unemployment, poverty. We have the largest youth cohort in history coming into the workforce in the Middle East. And that is how the Arab Spring started. I mean, Tunis started because of the economy, not because of politics. \"What keeps me up at night is poverty and unemployment. We have, in the past 10 years, managed to establish a credible middle class. But any shifts in oil prices, economic challenges, that middle class becomes very fragile. ... You really need a strong, stable middle class.\" A boy holds Jordan's national flag at a protest calling for King Abdullah II to institute more constitutional reforms in Amman, Sept. 9.

Security forces formed a human chain to keep demonstrators at bay. On the role of the king today \"My job is to put food on the table for people. And what I meant by that is, basically, creating a middle class, knowing full well \u2014 and looking again at the European model, the United States in particular, also \u2014 the stronger you have a middle class, the easier I think political transformation happens. \"So it's a two-edged sword: The more I support with my economic plans the building of the middle class, the quicker they're going to turn around and say, 'Hey, we want a bigger say in things.' So, I knew what I was getting into right at the beginning. It's the right thing to do. This is bigger than Jordan. We want to be an example for the rest of the Arab world. Because there are a lot of people who say that the only democracy you can have in the Middle East is the Muslim Brotherhood. And I don't think that's the case.\" On the future of Jordan's monarchy \"The monarchy that I hand over to my son is not going to be the same one that I have inherited. ... There is a tendency by a lot of officials to hide behind the king. And it's about time that officials take their responsibility and are responsible in front of the people. Because today, if you're appointed by the king, they don't feel that they're responsible for the people. If you have a government that is elected, they need to do the hard work \u2014 because if they don't, they won't be around the next time the ballot box is open.\" On holding elections in Jordan \"We're announcing municipal elections at the end of the year, and national elections at the beginning of next year. The challenge that we have \u2014 and this brings concerns, but also excitement \u2014 is trying to get a democratic mentality. For all the town-hall meetings that I have ... there's one question I now ask on purpose, because the first couple times I asked it, the answer surprised me. I say, 'Where do you stand on health, education, taxes, services, et cetera?' \u2014 and 99 percent, I get blank looks.\" On Jordan's political climate \"As an American colleague said to me several months ago, he said, 'I think the challenge in Jordan' \u2014 again, this is for the rest of the Middle East \u2014 'we need to define what \"center\" is. Once we can define what \"center\" is to a Jordanian, then we can decide what's left and what's right of that.' ... That takes time, for people to look along those lines.\" On the future of the Arab Spring \"No expert in the world now can predict what's going to happen in the Middle East. Things are happening too quickly, and the area is changing so rapidly that we really don't know. ... A very senior European politician said that when they saw the Israeli Embassy in Cairo being attacked, that was like taking a bucket of cold water and pouring it over a lot of heads of states' heads in the West. So, there is concern of where is this Arab Spring leading to in many countries. But the only way that we can help is all of us pitch in and try to support those countries go through these tough times.\"  DAVID GREENE, Host: It's MORNING EDITION from NPR News. Good morning, I'm David Greene. STEVE INSKEEP, Host: The man we'll hear from next has a very personal stake in dramatic events across the Middle East. King Abdullah of Jordan is one of many Arab rulers facing protests this year. He has responded by promising his people greater democracy over time. GREENE: But that's not his only challenge. Abdullah's nation is a neighbor of Israel and it's also home to millions of Palestinians. So he's directly affected by this week's meetings at the United Nations, where Palestinians plan to make a bid for statehood. INSKEEP: I think everybody is being backed into a corner. So we're working desperately to find a mechanism that is acceptable to all sides. So there's been a lot of late-night meetings between Palestinians, the Israelis, the Americans, et cetera. INSKEEP: Given the state of negotiations, is it acceptable to you to walk away from this U.N. meeting this week, with something less than recognition of Palestinian statehood? INSKEEP: Having said that, I have to commend the role of the European Union, trying to find a mechanism that pleases everybody. We've had - every six hours it seems to change. So I think until the last minute, which is Friday when the Palestinians make the decision, there's a lot of behind-the-scenes negotiations to find something that's acceptable for everybody. INSKEEP: Meaning something short of statehood that pushes a vote on statehood down the road, but gets negotiations started with... INSKEEP: Well, I think what the Europeans are looking at is asking for statehood in a way that then there is a technical process that gives some time to allow Israelis and Palestinians to sit at the table and re-launch negotiations on final status issues. INSKEEP: As you know, King Abdullah, Turkey has downgraded the state of its relations with Israel. Your country, we'll remind people, has relations with Israel. INSKEEP: Yes. INSKEEP: Have you considered downgrading your relations with Israel? INSKEEP: So there is going to be immense pressure. And people asking, why are we having this relationship when it's not benefitting anybody? INSKEEP: You're saying you could be forced to take steps against Israel. INSKEEP: And no matter what's happening in the Middle East - the Arab Spring, et cetera, the economic challenges, high rates of unemployment - the emotional, critical issue is always the Israeli-Palestinian one. INSKEEP: I'm glad you mentioned the Arab Spring. What is it like to be a king of an Arab state at a time of a revolution like this? INSKEEP: Well, actually quite exciting. I think that, you know, we have been trying to push reform. There has been a lot of pushback by the more conservative elements. And what the Arab Spring or the Arab Awakening did was bringing the subject front and center. As a result, in Jordan we've created a national dialogue committee. We went on outreach with everybody. We're announcing municipal elections at the end of the year, and national elections beginning of next year. INSKEEP: Given the realities in other countries, how do you keep a lid on - if that's the appropriate way to put it? How do you avoid an explosion for a year here? INSKEEP: Well, again, you know, what's happening today, now - as long a people are - benchmark understand what needs to be done. I think the challenge that I have is managing people's expectations. Even if we have parliamentary elections in 2012, you're not going to have those new political parties. So we can have a new parliament next year. But until we get right, left and center, there's going to be a delay for that. That's the challenge. INSKEEP: When you talk about left, right and center, you're basically talking about laying out a democratic political landscape in your country.... INSKEEP: Exactly... INSKEEP: ...what do people stand for and what do they believe. INSKEEP: In short terms, I announced last year - I mean the beginning of this year, and I've been speaking to everybody, saying, look, my vision of Jordan is two to five political parties, representing left, right and center, as quickly as possible. INSKEEP: Does it bother you that one of the implied and often explicit messages of these protests across the Arab world, is that, if I may say, people like you should have less power or perhaps no power? INSKEEP: So it's a two-edged sword, the more I support, with my economic plans, the building of a middle class, the quicker they're going turn around and say, hey, we want a bigger say in things. So I knew what I was getting into right at the beginning. It's the right thing to do. This is bigger than Jordan. We want to be an example for the rest of the Arab world. Because there are a lot of people who say that the only democracy you can have in the Middle East is the Muslim Brotherhood. And I don't think that's the case. I think if a monarchy, as you said, can show a new democratic platform, then I think we'll be a symbol for other countries. INSKEEP: Do you expect there to be a monarchy that you would pass on to your heir, and if so what power would remain to the king? INSKEEP: Well, we're obviously going through some tremendous changes today. I think we've said this in interviews before over the past 10 years, that the monarchy that I hand over to my son is not going to be the same one that I've inherited. There's a tendency by a lot of officials to hide behind the king and it's about time that officials take their responsibility and are responsible in front of the people. INSKEEP: What troubles you most about the protests of this year? INSKEEP: Well, what bothers me in a lot of countries is, you know, society is being led by the street, as opposed to a light at the end of the tunnel. But we've got to remember that the Arab Spring began - and there's challenges all over the world, including your country, because of economic difficulties: unemployment, poverty, we have the largest youth cohort in history coming into the workforce in the Middle East - and that is how the Arab Spring started. I mean, Tunis started because of economy, not because of politics. What keeps me up at night is poverty and unemployment. We have, in the past 10 years, managed to establish a credible middle class. But any shifts in oil prices, economic challenges - that middle class becomes very fragile. INSKEEP: Are you also worried about who ends up ruling Arab countries? INSKEEP: And today, with all the internal problems, unfortunately, they're not going to be on the scene for several years until this all settles. And I'm sad to see that, because we desperately need a strong, stable Egypt. INSKEEP: And then there's Syria, your neighbor. What worries you most about the protests against Bashar al-Assad, the leader there? INSKEEP: Well, from what I can see, I don't see much changes in the immediate future, which means that demonstrations will continue for quite a while. You know, there's nobody - no expert in the world now, can predict what's going to happen in the Middle East. Things are happening too quickly, and the area is changing so rapidly that we really don't know. INSKEEP: King Abdullah, thanks very much. INSKEEP: Thank you, sir.

Scroll down and read \"up\" if you want to see how his address went. Update at 10:49 a.m. ET. \"Peace is Hard\" But Possible: As he finishes, the president says that \"I  know that there is no straight line to progress, no single path to success. We  come from different cultures, and carry with us different histories. But let us  never forget that even as we gather here as heads of different governments, we  represent citizens who share the same basic aspirations \u2013 to live with dignity  and freedom; to get an education and pursue opportunity; to love our families  and our God. To live in the kind of peace that makes life worth living. ... Peace  is hard, but we know that it is possible. Together, let us resolve to see that  it is defined by our hopes and not our fears. Together, let us work to make, not  merely a peace, but a peace that will last.\" Update at 10:46 a.m. ET. Standing up \"For The Rights Of Gays And Lesbians\": After making the case for action on climate change, battling poverty and battling disease, the president says that \"no country should deny people their rights because of who they love, which is  why we must stand up for the rights of gays and lesbians everywhere. And no  country can realize its potential if half its population cannot reach theirs.  This week, the United States signed a new Declaration on Women's Participation.

Israel And Palestine Must Learn \"To Stand In Each Other's Shoes\": \"That  truth \u2013 that each side has legitimate aspirations \u2013 is what makes peace so hard,\" Obama says. \"And the deadlock will only be broken when each side learns to stand in each  other's shoes.\" Update at 10:35 a.m. ET. Israel's Position: After reaffirming America's \"unshakeable\" committment to Israel's security, Obama says \"let's be honest with ourselves: Israel is surrounded by neighbors that have waged repeated wars  against it. ... \"Israel deserves recognition. It deserves normal relations with its neighbors.  And friends of the Palestinians do them no favors by ignoring this truth, just  as friends of Israel must recognize the need to pursue a two state solution with  a secure Israel next to an independent Palestine.\" Update at 10:34 a.m. ET. Peace Will Not Come \"Through Statements And Resolutions At The U.N.: Continuing to talk about the Israeli-Palestinian issue, Obama says \"I  know that many are frustrated by the lack of progress. So am I. But the question  isn't the goal we seek \u2013 the question is how to reach it. And I am convinced  that there is no short cut to the end of a conflict that has endured for  decades. Peace will not come through statements and resolutions at the UN \u2013 if  it were that easy, it would have been accomplished by now. Ultimately, it is  Israelis and Palestinians who must live side by side.

On Israel And Palestine: \"One  year ago,\" says Obama, \"I stood at this podium and called for an independent Palestine. I  believed then \u2013 and I believe now \u2013 that the Palestinian people deserve a state  of their own. But what I also said is that genuine peace can only be realized  between Israelis and Palestinians themselves. One year later, despite extensive  efforts by America and others, the parties have not bridged their differences.\" Update at 10:30 a.m. ET. American Will Support Universal Rights: \"We will always stand up for the universal rights that were embraced by this  Assembly,\" says Obama. \"Those rights depend upon elections that are free and fair; governance  that is transparent and accountable; respect for the rights of women and  minorities; and justice that is equal and fair.\" Update at 10:28 a.m. ET. Will We Stand With Syria's Oppressors? \"In  Iran, we have seen a government that refuses to recognize the rights of its own  people,\" Obama says. \"And as we meet here today, men, women and children are being tortured,  detained and murdered by the Syrian regime. Thousands have been killed, many  during the holy time of Ramadan. Thousands more have poured across Syria's  borders. The Syrian people have shown dignity and courage in their pursuit of  justice \u2014 protesting peacefully, standing silently in the streets, dying for the  same values that this institution is supposed to stand for. The question for us  is clear: Will we stand with the Syrian people, or with their oppressors?\" Update at 10:26 a.m. ET. \"Peace Is Hard ... Progress Can Be Reversed\": After reviewing the remarkable events of the past year, from the Arab Spring to the killing of Osama bin Laden, the president says \"let us remember: peace is hard.

And on events in Libya, he says \"the will of the coalition proved unbreakable, and the will of the Libyan people  could not be denied. Forty-two years of tyranny was ended in six months. ...  \u2013 nations standing  together for the sake of peace and security; individuals claiming their rights.\" Update at 10:20 a.m. ET. \"We Stand At A Crossroads Of History\": \"Yes,  this has been a difficult decade,' Obama says. \"But today, we stand at a crossroads of history  with the chance to move decisively in the direction of peace. To do so, we must  return to the wisdom of those who created this institution. The UN's Founding  Charter calls upon us, 'to unite our strength to maintain international peace  and security.' And Article 1 of this General Assembly's Universal Declaration of  Human Rights reminds us that, \"All human beings are born free and equal in  dignity and rights.' Those bedrock beliefs \u2013 in the responsibility of states,  and the rights of men and women \u2013 must be our guide.\" Update at 10:18 a.m. ET. \"The Tide Of War Is Receding\": \"Let there be no doubt: the tide of war is receding,\" Obama says. \"When I took office, roughly  180,000 Americans were serving in Iraq and Afghanistan. By the end of this year,  that number will be cut in half, and it will continue to decline. This is  critical to the sovereignty of Iraq and Afghanistan, and to the strength of the  United States as we build our nation at home.\" Update at 10:15 a.m. ET. \"The Pursuit Of Peace\": As he begins, the president says he \"would like to talk to you about a subject that is at the heart of the United  Nations \u2014 the pursuit of peace in an imperfect world.\"",

Former Mexican Foreign Minister Jorge Castaneda spends four months out of the year teaching in New York, and when he looks toward home his optimism mixes with worry. In Manana Forever? Castaneda tries to encapsulate the paradoxes and promises of his country. He writes that Mexico will achieve the benefits of modernity \"only if its soul ceases to be a burden for its people, if its character and culture become instruments of change, and no longer of immobility.\" But that's not to say Mexicans haven't accomplished anything. \"Roughly since 1996,\" Castaneda tells NPR's Neal Conan, \"economic stability \u2014 financial stability \u2014 has made it possible for the country now to become a majority middle-class society.\" Read An Excerpt That fact, he says, surprises many Americans \u2014 and many Mexicans too. \"We continue to have a very negative view of ourselves in Mexico,\" he says, \"continuing to believe that this is a country of a few fabulously wealthy individuals and an enormous majority of poor people.\" It may have been the case in the past, he says, but it's not the case anymore. According to Castaneda, today's large middle-class society has become incompatible with the radical, extreme Mexican individualism that helped the country weather five centuries of adversity. Castaneda says that while the \"rabid\" individualism inherent in the Mexican psyche surprises many, there's a long list of ways in which that mentality manifests itself in Mexican culture. \"We have no class-action suits in Mexico,\" he points out. \"We have no high-rise residential buildings in Mexico \u2014 poor, middle class or upper class, Mexicans don't like to live in common apartments. ... We're terrible at team sports. ... But we're good at individual sports. And perhaps most significantly, we participate less in all sorts of associative practices.\" To put it simply: Mexicans don't choose to join groups. Castaneda says that's because, historically, the Mexican state imposed itself so overwhelmingly upon civil society that it was impossible for people to organize. \"So Mexicans began \u2014 from the very beginning, from the Conquest practically, when they weren't really Mexicans \u2014 to find individual solutions to collective problems,\" he says. Take emigration as an example: \"With the exception of El Salvador and Ecuador today, Mexico is the country in the world that has the largest share of its population living abroad,\" Castaneda says. In other words, Mexicans prefer to find individual solutions to collective problems by leaving. But individualism isn't Mexico's only problem. Mistrust of the government \u2014 which is connected to that individualism \u2014 is another factor. So when Mexican politicians do wrong, Castaneda says, the populace largely reacts with hands-off cynicism. \"Mexico's tremendous aversion to conflict and confrontation and competition,\" he says, \"almost obliges Mexican society not to confront its politicians, not to confront its elites, not to confront its leaders, but simply put up with it.\" He says institutional change has helped Mexico move toward modernity, in spite of its national character. \"The advent of rotation in power since 1997 has made a huge difference in corruption at the federal level.\" But changing attitudes at the bottom could do even more for eradicating corruption. It's a more obscure goal, but Castaneda says he thinks it's possible thanks to what he's learned about Mexican nationals who moved to the U.S. in the past 10 to 15 years. \"They do change,\" he says. \"Not only do they change; they transmit their changes back home.\" Thanks to that, attitudes and conceptions are slowly beginning to change in Mexico as well.

The ongoing uprisings in the Middle East and North Africa will not be resolved without economic reform in the region, President Obama said in his speech on Mideast issues at the State Department on Thursday. \"Politics alone has not put protesters into the streets,\" he said. \"The tipping point for so many people is the more constant concern of putting food on the table and providing for a family.\" His proposals include debt relief and private investment to support America's objective of promoting reform across the region \u2014 aspirations that must confront the economic realities of the Middle East in order to succeed. Economic factors were a crucial spark in the beginning of the uprisings, Georgetown  University's Samer Shehata tells Guy Raz, host of weekends on All Things Considered. \"In Tunisia, you had unemployment of about 15 percent,\" he says. Youth unemployment, he adds, is three times as high. In Egypt, Shehata continues, 40 percent of the population is living at or below poverty. Like many other Middle Eastern countries, Egypt faces rampant corruption, cronyism and increasing income inequality, too. And across the region, he says, decades of oil-fueled oligarchies must still be removed before economic investment can turn the region around. That kind of change may require more investment than the president is offering, Shehata says. \"Many people have spoken about an Arab martial fund,\" he says, a vehicle that would include tens of billions of dollars in aid \u2014 \"not simply limited to debt relief, to really make an impact on many of these countries.\" Yet it's not all about economics for protesters in the streets of Yemen, Syria and Bahrain, even as their demonstrations \u2014 and the subsequent reactions of oppressive regimes \u2014 may contribute to instability and a lack of economic investment in the region. \"It has to be emphasized,\" Shehata says, \"the Palestinian issue is an issue that affects people in the Arab world at the level of identity.\" That's a factor that's not appreciated well enough in the U.S., he says. The instability caused by an endless Israel-Palestine conflict has sometimes been used as an excuse for a lack of economic development in the region, he says. Theoretically, economic development shouldn't necessarily require a peaceful relationship between the two, \"but there's no question a resolution would only be good economically as well.\"",

Yemen's president has agreed to a proposal by Gulf Arab mediators to step down within 30 days and hand power to his deputy in exchange for immunity from prosecution, a major about-face for the autocratic leader who has ruled for 32 years. The protest movement demanding President Ali Abdullah Saleh's immediate departure reportedly said Saturday that it also accepted the latest draft of the deal but with reservations. A day earlier, protesters staged the largest of two months of demonstrations, filling a five-lane boulevard across the capital with a sea of hundreds of thousands of people. A deadly crackdown by government forces and Saleh supporters has killed more than 130 people and prompted key allies to abandon the president and join the protesters. The opposition movement, fed up with poverty and corruption under Saleh, took inspiration from the toppling of leaders in Tunisia and Egypt. The six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council, which includes powerful Saudi Arabia, has been seeking to broker an end to the crisis in the fragile and impoverished nation on the southern edge of the Arabian peninsula. The White House issued a statement applauding the deal and urging all \"parties to move swiftly to implement the terms of the agreement so that the Yemeni people can soon realize the security, unity, and prosperity that they have so courageously sought and so richly deserve.\" Under the latest draft, Yemen's parliament would grant Saleh legal protection from prosecution. The president would submit his resignation to lawmakers within 30 days and hand power to his vice president, who would call for new presidential elections. Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh waves to supporters during a rally in Sanaa,Yemen, on April 15.\n                \n                    \n                    Muhammed Muheisen/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Speaking to All Things Considered host Linda Wertheimer from Saudi   Arabia, NPR's Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson said the details \"are still murky.\" \"There are a lot of 'ifs' and caveats here that make this tenuous at best,\" she said. The problem, she notes, is that the opposition isn't one entity; there are youth groups and groups of more established people like Major Gen. Ali Mohsen al-Ahmar, a senior general who was a close confidant of Saleh before defecting. \"So some people are saying yes, they agree to this, but there's some reservation as well, because the family ... walks away with immunity from prosecution, and not necessarily everyone in Yemen is happy with that,\" Nelson said. Opposition spokesman Mohammed Kahtan said, however, the leaders of the opposition parties have all agreed on the Gulf council's initiative. He listed several reservations, though. He said the opposition rejects the draft proposal's call for the formation of a national unity government within seven days of the signing of a deal and wants to see Saleh step down first. \"We would have to swear an oath to Saleh, who has already lost his legitimacy,\" he explained. The opposition is also against giving Yemen's Parliament dominated by Saleh's party the power to approve or reject his resignation, which opens to the door to allowing the president time to stall. State TV reported that Yemen's foreign minister delivered the government's acceptance to mediators on Saturday. The foreign minister of the United Arab Emirates, Sheik Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, met in the Emirati capital Saturday with his Yemeni counterpart, Abu Bakr al-Qirbi, and urged him to accept the GCC plan, the official UAE news agency WAM reported. Saudi Arabia had lost patience with Saleh some time ago and had been trying to broker a deal, Nelson said. \"I think it just go to the point where they were telling him, 'Hey, look, you don't have support here anymore. We certainly don't support you, and you need to do this.' The fact that there would be immunity from prosecution obviously made this deal sweet enough,\" she said. \"It's also important to note that the protests were growing. It really was unclear how much longer Mr. Saleh could hold on.\" Protests continued throughout the day and expanded to include a general strike. Schools, government offices and private companies shut their doors in response to the Yemeni opposition's call for a strike aimed at putting more pressure Saleh to step down. Thousands of protesters kept up sit-ins at city squares in at least five provinces, while Saleh accused the opposition of \"dragging the country into a civil war\" in a televised speech to a military academy. \"He's certainly been a very hard-line ruler,\" Nelson said. \"He's been very vicious with any opponents, and, like many other dictators or rulers in the region, he felt like he knew what was best and he treated with some level of condescension the people that he was ruling over.\" Add to that the fact that Yemen is one of the poorest countries in the Arab world, the rampant unemployment and corruption, and not a whole lot of oil reserves or wealth going to the people, she said. \"So the tensions just kept building and building, and as the Arab Spring ... was emerging across the region, certainly Yemeni young people started to join in,\" Nelson said. \"The protests began there at the universities.\" Saleh has over the past two months used violence to try to quell the unrest. He has also offered concessions, including a pledge not to run again for president when his term is up in 2013 or allow his son to succeed him, but to no avail.

Deval Patrick\n                    \n                \nhide caption In 1970, a scholarship took Deval Patrick from Chicago's South Side to Milton Academy, a boarding school in Massachusetts. Read An Excerpt Even Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick himself describes the story of his life \u2014 from growing up on welfare in Chicago to thriving in business and politics \u2014 as \"improbable.\" That's why the word is part of the title of his new memoir, A Reason to Believe: Lessons from an Improbable Life. Speaking with Morning Edition co-host Renee Montagne, Patrick says his success stems from having supportive family and teachers \u2014 and from learning to look at life's lessons as \"gifts.\" An Early Abandonment Long before he became a top executive at Texaco and Coca-Cola; years before he attended Harvard Law School and argued a Supreme Court case, Deval Patrick was a 4-year-old boy, chasing his father down the sidewalk. That was in the 1960s, when his parents were finally splitting up for good. Patrick says that the day his father left their basement apartment on Chicago's South Side is burned into his memory. Reading from his memoir, Patrick describes that day: As my mother, in tears, slumped in a chair, my father stormed out of the apartment, up the stairs to the street, and was gone. I chased after him \u2014 a four-year-old in despair \u2014 while he strolled away angrily, shouting at me, 'Go home! Go home!' About a block down, he lost his patience, turned suddenly in a rage, and slapped me. I sprawled out on the sidewalk, burning my palms on the pavement. From that position, I watched him walk away. After that day, Patrick's father, jazz musician Laurdine \"Pat\" Patrick, was in touch with the family only sporadically. Learning To Hope, Getting 'A Break' Patrick grew up on welfare, going to large (and sometimes violent) public schools. But he still had hopes for a better future \u2014 thanks to his mother and his grandparents, and other adults in their neighborhood. And he says that often, he got the love and support that he needed the most from teachers. Some of them even became his mentors. \"It was teachers who were affectionate, and outwardly expressive about that, and encouraging,\" Patrick says. In 1970, when Patrick was 14, he got what he calls \"a break\" \u2014 a scholarship that sent him to Milton Academy, a private boarding school in Massachusetts. It was quite a change, Patrick says. At his new school, \"summer\" was often used as a verb; \"jacket\" referred to a blazer, not the windbreaker his grandparents had bought him in Chicago. But he adjusted \u2014 and after Milton, he went on to attend Harvard, where he also went to law school. A Thaw In A Tortured Relationship Patrick spent a summer during law school working in Washington, D.C. And on his 25th birthday, his father happened to be in town, playing baritone saxophone with a quartet. He invited his son to the show. \"I hadn't spent a birthday with him since I was three,\" Patrick writes in his book. But he went to the show \u2014 at a venue called the Pigfoot \u2014 and his father dedicated a song to him: \"I Can't Get Started.\" Reading a passage from his book, Patrick quotes a line from the song: \"I've been around the world in a plane; I've started revolutions in Spain; the North Pole I've charted. Still, I can't get started with you.\" Patrick writes that his father looked him in the eye while he played the song, \"full of regret and longing, all at once.\" \"I gazed right back at him, knowing what he was trying to say: Life is too short to go on like this. Let's find a way to come together.\"  Trying To 'Give Something Back' As a successful politician whose father was either absent or a source of conflict in his family, Patrick is not alone \u2014 both Barack Obama and Bill Clinton had similar relationships with their fathers. When asked how that experience might have affected his political career, Patrick begins his answer by saying, \"I feel like I should be lying down to answer that question.\" \"I view the experiences that I have had \u2014 both the tough ones and the pleasant ones \u2014 as gifts,\" he says. \"They've been full of lessons. And I've learned to be open to those lessons.\" Patrick is now in his second term as Massachusetts' governor. According to state law, he could run for re-election again. But that's not his plan \u2014 the governor feels he's achieved his goal in two terms. \"This is really another manifestation, for me, of how to give something back,\" he says, \"how to offer some ways in which we can make a better way for someone else \u2014 just as these very private lessons have made a better way for me.\" Lessons From An Improbable Life by Deval Patrick Hardcover, 227 pages | Your purchase helps support NPR programming.

The first round of Chicago's mayor election is Tuesday. There are six candidates on the ballot, but the race has essentially come down to a contest between former White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel and the rest of the field. The current mayor, Richard M. Daley, has been in office for 22 years, and this is the first open race for mayor in decades. Many Chicagoans like to complain about Daley's autocratic style and the corruption on his watch at City Hall, but voters re-elected him time and again, by huge margins, as they did his father. The Business Of Leading Chicago The current mayor is especially well liked in Chicago's business community, so as movers and shakers sat down this week at a luncheon hosted by the City Club of Chicago, Daley's legacy loomed large over the race to be his successor. \"I think the mayor had a terrific sense of what was necessary to build Chicago as a global city,\" says Lew Collens, president emeritus of the Illinois Institute of Technology. \"He's been very focused on that; he's done an extraordinary job.\" Collens says there is one candidate who is best able to continue moving Chicago forward and close a massive $600 million budget deficit, but he declined to say who that is. Other business and civic leaders, though, had no qualms about singing the praises out loud of the front-runner in the race, Rahm Emanuel. \"I think he's a real solid leader \u2014 kick rear-end, possibly, and not take any names,\" Chicago attorney Jerry Latherow says. \"Maybe I'd like to see him do it a little bit more delicately, but I think he'll get things done.\" Emanuel's Lead Pits Him Against 50 Percent To be sure, there were supporters of the other major candidates at the City Club luncheon, but Emanuel leads Chicago's mayoral race in most polls by a 2-to-1 margin. He's earned the major newspapers' endorsements and has raised a whopping $13 million for the campaign \u2014 almost quadruple the amount raised by the next closest candidate. Paul Green, director of the Institute for Politics at Chicago's Roosevelt  University, says Emanuel is essentially in a race to top 50 percent of the vote in order to avoid going to a run-off election in April against whoever comes in second. \"One of my favorite lines about politics is, there's no such thing as a silver medal.  You either win or you lose. Well, in this election, there could possibly be a reward for the silver medal,\" Green says. \"If Rahm Emanuel doesn't get 50-percent plus one, you're in the playoffs.\" Other Candidates On The Attack With Emanuel teetering right around that 50-percent line in the polls, his opponents are sharpening their attacks. In the last debate between the candidates Thursday night, City Clerk Miguel del Valle appealed to Latino voters by hitting Emanuel on immigration reform. \"The fact of the matter is that Rahm Emanuel referred to immigration as the 'third rail of politics' when he advised his colleagues in Congress not to pursue immigration reform,\" del Valle said. Former U.S. Sen. Carol Moseley Braun tried to boost her standing among black voters by also attacking Emanuel's record in Congress. \"Mr. Emanuel voted against the Congressional Black Caucus 128 times,\" she said, adding that he also \"voted against issues having to do with poverty and sending water to drought-starved Africa.\" After the debate, former Chicago School Board President Gery Chico, who is second in most polls, added, \"I think you saw Rahm Emanuel on the defense for just about 60 minutes and that's because he's spent 60 days evading questions and the truth about those questions.\" For his part, Emanuel tried to remain above the fray. \"You can call me whatever names you want,\" he said. \"I'm not here about calling names, I'm here about focusing on the problems facing the city of Chicago.\" But Emanuel has been quietly taking his shots, too, with robocalls and nonstop ads. The mud will likely continue to fly all the way up to Tuesday's election.",

            "article_content": "This edition of Political Junkie:  The rise (and long fall) of Joe Lieberman ... a farewell to Sargent Shriver ... additional 2010 obits ... former Rep. Jay Rhodes (R-Ariz.) has died ... this week's Junkie segment on TOTN (and the trivia question)... the latest podcast ... and the return of ScuttleButton! Quite a busy week, with the announcement by Sen. Joe Lieberman (I-Conn.) that he's not going to run for re-election, the death of Sargent Shriver, and the debate on the House floor over a health care repeal.  And I certainly can't omit what may have been the most eyebrow-raising incident of the week, the interview Sen. Harry Reid had on Tuesday with Nevada journalist Jon Ralston, in which the majority leader called Chinese President Hu Jintao \"a dictator.\"  Given the timing \u2014 Wednesday night was an official state dinner at the White House thrown by President Obama in Hu's honor \u2014 it seemed pretty, well, odd. All I can say is thank goodness we didn't have that wacky Sharron Angle in the Senate.  You know how she always says outlandish things. Lots of things to talk about on this Friday, but I'm going to start  with the decision of Lieberman, announced on Wednesday, not to seek a fifth term in Connecticut. Democrats never forgave Lieberman for his political \"embrace\" of George W. Bush.\n                hide caption I admit I was taken aback by the news.   Yes, it would have been a tough race, as he acknowledged at his Stamford event, but all along he kept sounding like a candidate.  Plus, as he also said, he's been in tough races before, like 1988 when he was not supposed to unseat GOP Sen. Lowell Weicker, or in 2006, when he lost the Democratic primary to Ned Lamont but went on to win as an independent in November. But something seems to have changed in Lieberman since that 2006 primary defeat, where he was abandoned by many of his longtime allies primarily because of his support for President Bush's Iraq war policy. By winning that year, he became the first senator in at least a half-century to be denied renomination and yet keep his seat (the second, Alaska's Lisa Murkowski, did so as a write-in candidate last year). It would probably be fair to say that his disillusionment with his own party came before his 2006 rejection.  Remember, he was the Democratic nominee for vice president in 2000 \u2014 the first Jew to be on a major-party ticket \u2014 a ticket that won the popular vote.  But Lieberman, as many vice-presidential nominees do, felt that the logical next step would be to seek the brass ring itself, and in 2004 he announced his candidacy for the White House.  He was reportedly deeply hurt when Al Gore, his 2000 ticket mate, decided instead to endorse Howard Dean, the anti-war former governor of Vermont, for the nomination.  Lieberman saw it as a betrayal.  But Gore was not about to endorse a candidate who supported the war. As it was, Lieberman's bid went nowhere; he was out of the race by Feb. 3. In many ways, Lieberman was a true independent.  And that's what Americans and the media say they want, right?  We keep hearing they want more of their politicians to work across party lines.  However, they just never liked Lieberman's approach.  Or maybe they simply didn't like Lieberman.  (I suspect that there is more tolerance in this country, at least in the media, for Republicans who often vote with Democrats than the opposite.) The truth is, he most often voted with the Democrats, the party he stayed a part of, especially on domestic issues.  Rumors that he was considering switching to the GOP were totally baseless.  But his position on the war, followed by his endorsement of Republican presidential candidate John McCain and his denunciation of Democratic nominee Barack Obama at the 2008 GOP convention, were simply too much for Connecticut Democrats. He became their most despised person. Of course, Democratic divisions about Lieberman go back to at least 1998, when he gave an impassioned denunciation of President Clinton on the Senate floor over his dalliance with Monica Lewinsky.  Some saw it as principled; others saw it as sanctimonious.  Whatever, it was probably one of the reasons Gore selected him as his running mate in 2000: to illustrate he (Gore) could be his own man, declaring his independence from Clinton. And what about the Republicans?  In 2006, they voted overwhelmingly for Lieberman.  Back then, the inept GOP candidate, Alan Schlesinger, received less than ten percent of the vote. But that was a long time ago. Now, there is no indication of any GOP love for Lieberman at all, especially in the wake of his health care vote and successful pushing for the repeal of \"don't ask, don't tell.\" So perhaps he just got sick of it all.  The joy in his face, the impish sense of humor ... much of that was gone in the past several years.  It was, in some respects, time to go. (Note:  Regarding this week's title.  I'm not calling Lieberman \"Joey\"  out of disrespect, or to be cutesy.  In his speech announcing his  retirement, several times Lieberman referred to conversations with his  wife, who called him \"Joey.\"  Just in case someone might think I was  being disrespectful.  I wasn't.) Lieberman's departure makes him the third senator to bid farewell in the past two weeks.  The decision by Texas Republican Kay Bailey Hutchison to retire is similar to that of Lieberman's; the odds are that the incumbent party will keep those seats.  The more interesting retirement is that of Sen. Kent Conrad (D-N.D.), which now moves that seat into the \"lean Republican\" category.  The Hutchison and Conrad retirements were reviewed in Tuesday's Political Junkie column. It's too soon to handicap the Connecticut race, but my early guess for Democratic frontrunner is Rep. Chris Murphy (D-5th CD), who knocked off then-GOP Rep. Nancy Johnson in 2006.   Susan Bysiewicz, the former secretary of state, jumped into the race on Wednesday, and some say Rep. Joe Courtney (D-2nd) might get in too.  I'm sticking with Murphy as the eventual Dem nominee. On the Republican side, former wrestling executive Linda McMahon, who lost last year's Senate race to Richard Blumenthal (D) after spending some $50 million of her own money, says she's looking at another run.  Others mentioned include former Rep. Rob Simmons, who lost the nomination to McMahon, and Tom Foley, who ran a strong race for governor in 2010.

Shriver,  the first director of the Peace Corps, died Tuesday at age 95; he had long been suffering from Alzheimer's.  A Kennedy brother-in-law \u2014 he married JFK's sister, Eunice \u2014 Sargent Shriver was a pretty amazing guy, with tons of energy that lasted late into his life.  And yet, for all he accomplished \u2014 in addition to the Peace Corps, he headed up President Johnson's \"War on Poverty\" program as director of the Office of Economic Opportunity and later served as LBJ's ambassador to France \u2014 he was never successful in his own political career. His hopes of seeking the Illinois governorship in 1960 were dashed when Joseph Kennedy, the family patriarch, told him he couldn't run because he needed to help with John Kennedy's presidential effort.  He was on the vice presidential short list in both 1964 (for Lyndon Johnson) and 1968 (for Hubert Humphrey), but the call never came.  He also briefly was a candidate for governor of Maryland in 1970. The running mate phone call did come, in 1972, but under very odd (and for Democrats, painful) circumstances.  Sen. George McGovern (D-S.D.), the Democrats' presidential nominee, selected Sen. Tom Eagleton of Missouri as his running mate.  But after the news leaked of his past psychiatric treatment for depression, Eagleton was forced off the ticket on July 31.  Five days later, after a slew of Senate Democrats \u2014 Hubert Humphrey, Ted Kennedy, Abe Ribicoff and Ed Muskie \u2014 had turned him down, McGovern decided to pick Shriver.  On Aug. 8, at a special meeting of the Democratic National Committee in the Sheraton Park hotel in Washington, it was made official. (He got 2,936 delegate votes out of a total of 3,013.  Missouri Gov. Warren Hearnes, angered by what he considered the unfair treatment of Eagleton, cast his state's 73 votes for Eagleton.  And four of Oregon's votes went to former Sen. Wayne Morse, who was campaigning that year to reclaim his seat.) Nobody was going to defeat President Nixon that year, certainly not George McGovern. As it was, the McGovern-Shriver ticket lost 49 states in a landslide blowout, but Shriver got good reviews for his candidacy.  And that led him to start thinking about four years down the road. With Ted Kennedy staying out of the '76 campaign, Shriver decided to run for president, laying claim to the \"Kennedy legacy.\"  But, as with many candidates with Kennedy connections \u2014 Ted Sorensen, Kenneth O'Donnell and Pierre Salinger come to mind \u2014 Shriver learned that the Kennedy mystique was not transferable.  And voters saw him as a Kennedy relative without the Kennedy charisma.  One of the last Democrats to get in the race, Shriver finished fifth in the Iowa caucuses, fifth in the New Hampshire primary and sixth in Massachusetts, and that was pretty much the end of his political career. The Washington Post's obituary made it clear that Shriver's political ambitions \"were as much propelled as they were frustrated by his connection to his in-laws,  the powerful political dynasty from Massachusetts\": When the family received word in 1964 that President Lyndon B. Johnson was  considering Mr. Shriver as a running mate, Eunice balked. \"No,\" she reportedly  said, and then invoked her brother Robert's name. \"It's Bob's turn.\" Kennedy aide Ken O'Donnell was more straightforward, telling Mr. Shriver that  if any of the inner circle were to run, it would be Bobby - not \"half a  Kennedy.\" The obit also included this wonderful vignette from the '72 election: Despite his people skills, Mr. Shriver made a huge gaffe on the campaign trail  while visiting a bar near a steel mill in Youngstown, Ohio. Locals ordered  Pabsts, Schlitzes or Buds. Mr. Shriver called out, \"Make mine a Courvoisier!\" The Shrivers had five children, including Mark Shriver, a former member of the Maryland House of Delegates who lost a close bid for Congress in the 2002 Democratic primary to Chris Van Hollen; and Maria Shriver, the former NBC journalist who is married to ex-California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger. Eunice Kennedy Shriver died in August 2009. More Obits: In my extensive listing of those in the political world who passed away in 2010, I acknowledged that the list is obviously not complete and asked for reader input on those I missed.  Here are some of them: Howard Zinn, 87, a civil rights activist, historian and left-wing ideologue who was the author of \"A People's History of the United States.\" (Jan. 27) Ben Westlund, 60, the state Treasurer of Oregon since 2008.  A Republican state representative, Westlund left the GOP in 2006 and briefly mounted an independent campaign for governor before switching to the Democrats later in the year. (March 7) Fred Heineman, 80, who upset Rep. David Price (D-N.C.) in the GOP sweep of 1994 only to lose his bid for re-election to Price two years later, and who prior to his term in Congress was the head of the Raleigh police department.  (March 20) Louis Henkin, 92, a Columbia Law School professor and an expert in the field of human rights law.  (Oct. 14) Tom Vandergriff, 84, the former mayor of Arlington, Texas, who won an open congressional seat in 1982 as a Democrat but who was ousted two years later by Dick Armey (R).  After his defeat he resurfaced as a Republican and was elected as a judge in Tarrant County.  As mayor, he played a major role in luring the Washington Senators baseball team to Arlington in 1972, where they became the Texas Rangers.  Tragically, the Rangers defeated the New York Yankees in the 2010 playoffs. (Dec. 29) Roger Milliken, 95, a billionaire textile magnate who was instrumental in turning South Carolina into a Republican bastion. (Dec. 29) John Wheeler, 66, who as chairman of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund in the 1980s worked to ensure the memorial to be built. (Dec. 31) Hat Tip to Liz Toy, John Hiestand, Matthew Bray, Karen Long and Kevin Dessy. from Rhodes' 1988 campaign\n                hide caption Jay Rhodes is gone. Word came in yesterday afternoon from my good friend, ex-Rep. Jack Buechner (R-Mo.), that a former colleague of his, Arizona's John Rhodes III \u2014 known to everyone as Jay \u2014 has died.  Rhodes, the son of former House Minority Leader John Rhodes, was elected to the House in 1986, replacing John McCain in the 1st District.  A landslide winner three times, Rhodes was blindsided in 1992 by Democrat Sam Coppersmith and lost his seat. I got to know Rhodes quite well in recent years when he was president of the Association of Former Members of Congress.  He was not a fan of the media, and was often quite cranky.  But he had a wry sense of humor and was always good to me, and would often tell me some great stories about the time when his dad went to President Nixon, along with other members of Congress, in the last days before Nixon's resignation during the Watergate scandal.  All of our conversations were off the record, but Jay promised me he would get them all into a book ... which he apparently never did.  My observation was that Rhodes was not a natural campaigner, nor a natural politician.  But he was a good guy, and I mourn his passing. Breaking News:  Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), the chairman of the House Budget Committee, will give the Republican response to President Obama's State of the Union address on Tuesday.

Click here to hear previous episodes. Trivia Answer: Sargent Shriver. This Day In Political History: Sen. Robert Byrd of West Virginia upsets Sen. Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts for Kennedy's job as Senate majority whip.  The vote is 31-24.  There had been much criticism of Kennedy's performance as whip, with some saying he wasn't focused on the job, whereas Byrd was well regarded for his knowledge of Senate procedure.  There was also some speculation that Kennedy's role in the Chappaquiddick incident \u2014 where a female companion in the car Kennedy was driving, Mary Jo Kopechne, drowned when the car went over a bridge in July 1969 \u2014 was a factor as well.  Key to Byrd's decision to run: the proxy from Ga. Sen. Richard Russell, who was dying in a Washington hospital (Russell, in fact, died less than five hours after the Senate vote.)  The result is thought to seriously damage the prospects of Kennedy seeking the presidency in 1972 (Jan. 21, 1971). Coming later today: ScuttleButton! Got a question?

Andrew Johnson, the so-called accidental president, is often cited  among America's worst leaders. Annette Gordon-Reed is inclined to agree.  In her book Andrew Johnson, she calls attention to the opportunities he  missed that might have helped resolve racial inequities that still  plague the U.S. today. Though Johnson and his predecessor, Abraham Lincoln, came from similar backgrounds, \"there was a great difference in native talent,\" Gordon-Reed tells NPR's Neal Conan. While Johnson was clearly intelligent, Lincoln \"was a genius, one of those extraordinary people who only come along once in a millennia.\" So, though Gordon-Reed thinks the comparison between the two presidents is a little unfair to Johnson, she also doesn't pull any punches in her assessment of Johnson's faults. Read An Excerpt \"He had a vision of America as a white man's government,\" Reed says. \"His idea was that the South had never really seceded because it was illegal -- secession was illegal -- and so they had never really left the United States.\" That meant, to Johnson, that once the hostilities ended, the country would go back to how it was before the Civil War, only without slavery. But that didn't mean Johnson saw great improvements for the lives of black people. He thought they'd be \"not citizens but serfs, totally under the dominion of white people, except white people would not have the capacity to turn them into legal chattel.\" Gordon-Reed also investigated a number of stories that have circulated about Johnson since the time he took office. For example, the allegation has been made that one of his slaves was his mistress, and that she bore him children. \"As you can imagine, in political campaigns people throw lots of things around,\" says Gordon-Reed. The woman in question was Dolly, whom Johnson bought when she was a teenager. \"Within a few years, she had two children that were listed as mulatto in the census, and she was listed as black,\" she explains. Gordon-Reed wasn't able to ascertain with certainty whether the story is true, but \"in deference to Dolly, a teenage enslaved girl,\" she thought it was worth mentioning in the story of Johnson's life. She also looked into the allegation that Johnson was somehow connected to the plot that murdered Lincoln. She didn't find evidence to support that rumor but has an explanation for its existence. \"When somebody that famous and that beloved dies, it's very hard for people to accept that just an ordinary person killed them.\" People wanted to believe there was a bigger explanation -- such as a coup involving Johnson -- for why Johnson escaped injury, but Lincoln was killed and Secretary of State William Seward was injured.\u00a0 Gordon-Reed believes John Wilkes Booth's co-conspirator, George Atzerodt, meant to kill Johnson, too, but that Atzerodt just got drunk instead. by Annette Gordon-Reed Hardcover, 166 pages | Your purchase helps support NPR programming.

Ruy Teixeira is a Senior Fellow at the Center for American Progress Action Fund. Each election cycle there occurs a tired ritual, in which pundits and reporters rediscover that yes, indeed, there are still a lot of white working class voters in America, and they represent a serious vulnerability for the Democrats. But just this once, let's skip the period where everyone initially ignores this group and cut straight to the chase: There will be a lot of white working class voters showing up at the polls next November, and the degree to which they support (or abandon) President Obama could very well make or break his reelection. In 2008, during his otherwise-solid election victory, Obama lost the white working class vote by 18 points. In 2010, however, things got much worse: Congressional Democrats' experienced a catastrophic 30 point deficit among the same group. While the first number is a figure Obama could live with repeating, the second could very well prove fatal. Indeed, if Republicans can replicate that 30 point deficit in 2012 \u2014 a margin which seems increasingly possible given the recent bad news about the economy \u2014 Obama will have little to no room for error among his other constituencies. For example, even if, as expected, the share of minority voters increases from 26 to around 28 percent in the next election and Obama receives the typical 75 percent of that vote, while the share of white working class voters declines by another 3 percentage points, a 30 point hole in Obama's white working class support would mean that the overall support he needs to win the election was teetering right on the knife's edge. In such a scenario, Obama would have to hold essentially all of his white college graduate support from 2008 (47 percent, a historic high for Democrats) to be assured of victory. And make no mistake about it, GOP strategy for 2012 will start with the white working class and attempt to drive up support among this group as high as possible. As an example, just take Romney's recently declared strategy: Romney advisers see a disconnect between the president's announcements of real progress on the economy at a time when there is, in the words of one, \"a massive disaster out there with people's lives.\" They argue that, on economic issues, Obama still has trouble connecting with voters, particularly those from the white working class. These tactics are likely to pay big dividends both nationally and, even more importantly, in the states where the election is actually decided. Consider the case of Ohio, a state the GOP must take back to take down Obama. White working class voters could end up representing as much as 56 percent of Ohio voters in 2012, judging from Census voter supplement data. Anything close to a 30 point deficit in 2012 will almost definitely sink Obama in this state, no matter what happens with the friendlier portions of the Ohio electorate. Or take Florida, Nevada, and Colorado, other states that are vulnerable to a white working class collapse. Florida's 29 electoral votes would assure Obama's re-election, assuming he manages to carry the 18 states, plus the District of Columbia, that Democrats have carried in every presidential election since 1992 (which, together, represent a total of 241 electoral votes). Compared to Ohio, Florida's white working class is smaller (a projected 42 percent of voters in 2012), but a 30 point deficit would still torpedo Obama's chances, putting this must-win state for the GOP firmly in their column. Nevada (42 percent white working class in 2012) and Colorado (46 percent), meanwhile, would also be put in serious doubt should Obama's support among this group crater in 2012. Even more alarmingly, the white working class vote provides the perfect way for the GOP to drive a wedge into those 241 electoral votes Democrats have held for five straight presidential elections. Contested states with high proportions of white working class voters like Minnesota (60 percent white working class in 2012), Wisconsin (58 percent), Pennsylvania (55 percent), and Michigan (53 percent) could easily be flipped if this group flees from Obama. But how likely is such a white working class surge toward the GOP in 2012? From the standpoint of Obama and the Democrats, scarily so. It's important to remember that this is the group that has been the bulwark of every GOP victory going back to Richard Nixon in 1968. And it is the group recently termed by journalist Ronald Brownstein as, \"[T]he most pessimistic group in America.\" In a recent Pew Economic Mobility Project poll, only one-third of working class whites thought today's children would live better than they do, far below the levels of confidence expressed by minorities and college-educated whites. And in a recent National Journal poll, only a third of white working class voters took a positive view of recent Census findings on the country's fast growing minority population, with 58 percent endorsing instead the pessimistic view that these trends are \"happening too quickly,\" and undermining fundamental American values at a time of high unemployment. These views are obviously rooted in the bleak economic situation confronting most members of the white working class. While that's bad enough, what's worse is that the economy is showing no signs of the kind of progress that might take the edge off these sentiments. This should worry the Obama team greatly and encourage the so-called \"pivot\" to the jobs issue that the administration is considering. A deal on debt reduction, however desirable for other reasons, will be no substitute for better economic conditions, especially among this difficult demographic. To be sure, the good news for Obama is that the level of support he needs from this group of voters is not terribly high. While a 30 point deficit might sink him, he could survive pretty easily on a 23 point deficit, John Kerry's margin in 2004. That Obama would likely win with this very large deficit, while Kerry lost, indicates just how much the demographics of the country have changed in the 8 years since Kerry's defeat. But while the bar for Obama may be lower, he still needs to clear it, and at the moment, that's looking like a real challenge.",

Obama has only weighed in once on the union protests in Indiana, Ohio and Wisconsin. Union organizers  are ramping up their efforts in state capitals across the country, emphasizing  that what began in Madison could have national consequences. Although there are real stakes for Washington, President Obama's team is working  to keep the focus on the statehouse, not the White House. The president  spent a full day in Ohio this week while  union workers were raising their voices in protest. The demonstrators were in  Columbus; Obama was in Cleveland. He spoke all  day long about small business and innovation yet did not say a word about the  labor conflict. In fact, he has only made one comment on the union battles, and that was last week. \"Some of what  I've heard coming out of Wisconsin, where you're just making it harder for  collective bargaining, generally seems like more of an assault on unions,\" he told  Milwaukee TV station WTMJ. The  White House is watching a lot and saying little. Some of this may reflect a broad  new sense of discipline. A year ago, the president was quick to change his focus  from one crisis to another. Today,  if the White House decides the president should spend the week talking about  small business, his focus is more likely to stay there. But  Republicans have also demonstrated why Obama might be better served by watching  from the sidelines. They accuse him of meddling in local affairs and preventing  Wisconsin's  governor from balancing the budget. \"I  think it's inappropriate for President Obama to do anything except try to deal  with these problems on a federal level,\" says former Wisconsin Republican U.S. Sen. Bob Kasten. \"He's  trying to have it both ways, and he's trying to tell the people that he's  concerned about deficits while also trying to tell a narrow group of public  employee unions that he's concerned about the governor of Wisconsin going too  far.\" President Obama's political machine, Organizing for America, helped  coordinate some of the protests. But this week one official there stressed that \"this is all being driven by the folks on the ground.\" The new approach from national leaders seems to be: Help where you  can, but don't toot your horn about it. And that's fine with the unions. \"We're not asking him to organize us; we can organize ourselves,\" said Gerry Hudson, executive vice president for the Service Employees  International Union, during a Wednesday protest outside Wisconsin's offices in Washington, D.C. Hudson said he appreciates Obama's support but doesn't need his help. He  fears that if the White House is too vocal, the  controversy in Wisconsin and elsewhere may  appear to be engineered from outside rather than a grassroots response  to behavior that labor activists view as union-busting. Protesters demonstrate outside the office of Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker during his fireside chat Tuesday at the Capitol.\n                \n                    \n                    Eric Thayer/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Protesters demonstrate outside the office of Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker during his fireside chat Tuesday at the Capitol. \"It might look  [manufactured] and it obviously isn't,\" he said, \"so we don't want anybody to  believe for one moment that the White House is organizing this. The White House  is not.\" There  could be significant consequences for the White House regardless. In recent  elections, Republicans have made inroads with working-class voters who used to  be staunch Democrats. This  may be a moment to reverse that trend. \"Democrats stand to solidify their position with working-class voters  who are sympathetic to these strikers,\" says Andrew Kohut of the Pew Research Center. \"This is especially important  because working-class voters have very much been a swing group in recent  elections.\" A new  Gallup poll  shows that 61 percent of Americans support collective bargaining rights. And many of  these protests are in politically important swing states, such as Wisconsin, Ohio and  Indiana. They  are places where Republicans made big gains in the 2010 midterm elections.  Democrats believe this conflict will help mobilize base voters for 2012, whether  the White House is vocal or silent, and whether the unions ultimately win or  lose.",

The Republican presidential contest remains fluid less than three weeks before the caucuses and primaries begin. Nationwide, nearly one in five GOP voters is still undecided. And in Iowa, candidates are making their final push before the Jan. 3 caucuses. Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney on Friday told workers at a metal fabricating plant in Sioux City, Iowa: \"I am running in this race because I understand how to get middle-class Americans prosperous again, working again, buying things, and putting more Americans back to work.\" Romney told the Missouri Valley Steel workers, some of them wearing hard hats as they watched him speak, that their plant reminded him of the company his wife's father used to run, as well as some of the companies he invested in as the leader of a private equity firm. Romney argues his successful business background makes him uniquely qualified to lift the fortunes of America's struggling middle class. \"I want to use the experience I have in the world of the free enterprise system to make sure that America gets working again,\" he said. Romney trails former House Speaker Newt Gingrich in most Iowa polls. But the gap between them has recently narrowed. Mindful of his second-place finish in Iowa in 2008, Romney has tried hard not to raise expectations.  But he made clear to supporters that he wants a strong finish Jan. 3. \"I know that the caucus site at the high school gets full, so get there early,\" he implored potential caucus-goers. \"I need you guys to get there.\" Missouri Valley Steel employee Shari Blackburn said she liked what Romney had to say, but that he hadn't yet won her support. \"I'm kind of torn between two candidates at this point,\" she said. \"I really like him.  But I also like Newt. So it might be a coin toss the day of the caucus.  I'm not sure.\" Rep.

Ron Paul of Texas also is polling well in Iowa, while other candidates are struggling just to get attention. Rep. Michele Bachmann of neighboring Minnesota launched a bus tour Friday, with a promise to visit all 99 Iowa counties over 10 days.   Bachmann argues that Gingrich and Romney have strayed too far from the conservative line on issues like health care and global warming to pose an effective challenge to President Obama. \"So you have the Newt-Romney,\" Bachmann says, using a term for the two-candidates-as-one that she has used at recent debates, including Thursday night's in Sioux City. \"And then you have Michele Bachmann. And they've said this is a two-man race, and I would agree. It's Newt-Romney versus Michele Bachmann, and I'm the conservative alternative.\" After his campaign stop in Sioux City, Romney flew to South Carolina, where he earlier got a key endorsement from the state's Republican governor, Nikki Haley, who won her own election in 2010 with strong Tea Party support. Romney and Haley were scheduled to campaign together in South Carolina on Saturday. South Carolina holds its primary Jan. 21, following only the Jan. 3 Iowa caucuses and the Jan. 10 New Hampshire primary.",

As the Egyptian elections roll on over the course of several more weeks, the incoming parliament looks likely to be dominated by Islamists. But the two leading Islamist blocs have little in common and are doing their best to undermine each other. The Muslim Brotherhood and Salafists do not get along in Alexandria's working-class slum of Abu Suleiman. Outside one polling station, the tension is thick as campaign workers for each group's political party hand out fliers. Zakareya Morshedy Mohammed, a volunteer for the Salafist party called Al-Nour, or \"the light,\" says it's a healthy competition. Al-Nour and the Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party each have a candidate running for one of the seats up for grabs in this runoff vote. That's not the case for the second seat, says Samir Mamdouh, a volunteer for the Freedom and Justice Party. He blasts his Salafist counterparts for soliciting votes for someone close to ousted president Hosni Mubarak's inner circle, who is running against the brotherhood candidate for that seat. The former Mubarak ally is a wealthy real estate developer named Tarek Talaat Moustafa, whose posters and banners hang side by side with the Salafist ones. Mamdouh says the fact that the Salafists are backing someone linked to the old regime proves they can't be trusted. Egyptian soldiers stand in front of campaign posters for candidates from the hard-line Islamist Salafist Al-Nour party, in the coastal city of Alexandria.\n                \n                    \n                    AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Egyptian soldiers stand in front of campaign posters for candidates from the hard-line Islamist Salafist Al-Nour party, in the coastal city of Alexandria. Al-Nour party volunteer Elwany Mahmoud Elwany dismisses his rival's grousing as sour grapes. He says that as devout Muslims, they ought to forgive each other. That's been hard, given that their devotion to Islam is about the only thing the brotherhood and Salafists seem to agree on, here or anywhere else in Egypt. Different Paths The brotherhood, with its decades of political experience, has steered clear of talking about its long-term goal for a more religious society in favor of more pressing issues such as Egypt's failing economy. The Salafists, on the other hand, are political newcomers who follow a more hard-line, Saudi-influenced interpretation of Islam. Their political campaign has centered on imposing a harsher brand of Islamic law in Egypt, something that worries secular Egyptians and the Coptic Christian community. Yet grass-roots support for these hard-liners is strong, and they ended up finishing second to the brotherhood in the first stage of parliamentary elections that began last week. \"The people who are surprised the most are the Muslim Brotherhood,\" says Khaled Fahmy, who chairs the history department at the American University in Cairo. \"They didn't expect that they will have a Salafi opposition in Parliament.\" Though both parties are Islamists, Fahmy says they have very different criteria and agendas. Based on what he has seen on TV and social media, the Muslim Brotherhood and Salafi candidates are fighting each other, he says. It didn't start out that way, however. Alliance Abandoned In a phone interview, Sobhy Saleh, the brotherhood's top parliamentary candidate in Alexandria, says his party tried forming an alliance with the Salafists early on. It made sense, he says, given their common history of being oppressed during the Mubarak era and shared views on strengthening the role of Islam in Egyptian society. But Saleh claims the Salafists broke off talks several months ago without explanation. Saleh says that given growing tensions between the two sides, it's difficult to see them forming a coalition in the new Parliament, either.",

A surge in Hispanic voters in that state could make his chances of winning it a little more likely.\n                \n                    \n                    Carolyn Kaster/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption President Obama received a warm welcome at Scranton High School in Scranton, Pa., Wednesday. A surge in Hispanic voters in that state could make his chances of winning it a little more likely. The American electorate is getting more diverse, more educated and younger. These demographic trends seem to suggest that voters could, in theory at least, be more Obama-friendly in 2012, especially in some key states. But it's not clear whether these shifts can outweigh the dragging economy and the president's dismal approval ratings. At President Obama's re-election headquarters in Chicago, there is one overriding article of faith: Despite all of his troubles, Obama's path to victory is still wider than it was for other recent Democratic candidates. Obama campaign spokesman Ben LaBolt says the Obama team will never have the problem Al Gore and John Kerry faced \u2014 a race that comes down to one state like Florida or Ohio. \"That means not only returning to those states that we were competitive in in 2008,\" LaBolt says, \"but also looking for potential pickup opportunities where the demographics have changed over the past four years.\" The changes in the age and ethnicity of voters made the Democrats' playing field bigger in 2008 and could, theoretically, expand it further in 2012. Ruy Teixeira just completed a study of voters at the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank. \"If you look at the national data,\" says Teixeira, \"Obama should have another couple of percentage points in the electorate for minorities to work with, probably also an increase of a percentage point in white college graduates and probably an overall decline of 3 points in white working-class voters who were his worst group last time by far. He lost them by 18 points.\" There also will be about 16 million more potential young voters in 2012 than were eligible to vote four years ago, Teixeira says. Young voters were among Obama's strongest supporters in 2008. Demographic changes made states like Colorado, Nevada, Virginia and North Carolina winnable for Democrats in 2008. Recent surges in the number of Hispanics in Arizona and Georgia could make those states potentially friendlier to Democratic candidates as well next year. Teixeira thinks similar population shifts could make holding on to Pennsylvania, where the president campaigned Wednesday, a little bit easier. \"Pennsylvania's actually shifting fairly rapidly demographically, especially compared to other, kind of, Rust Belt-type states,\" says Teixeira. \"That's obviously of some help to him, all else equal.\" But all else is not equal this year. Demography As Destiny? Republicans beg to differ with the demography as destiny theory. Notable among them is Karl Rove. He disagrees with assumptions that young voters in 2012 will vote as they did in 2008. Rove was the architect of President George W. Bush's re-election campaign in 2004. That campaign managed to find more Republican voters than Democrats had thought possible \u2014 just like the Obama team did with Democratic voters in 2008. Still, Rove doesn't believe it can happen again in 2012. \"Think about this,\" he says, \"Overall decline in [Obama's] job approval rating from the time of his inauguration among all groups is 24 [percentage] points. College graduates [are] down 24, Hispanics [are] down 23, young people [are] down 27 [percentage points]. Many of these people still like him personally and have fond feelings towards him, but they're disappointed with what he's done, with what he's promised, with how he's conducted himself in office, so it's hard to win them back unless conditions change.\" The Obama campaign is determined to try to expand the electorate again \u2014 even if conditions don't change politically.  Preparing To Act Democrats had a dress rehearsal of sorts last month in the off-year elections. In North Carolina, for instance, Republican strategist Chris Sinclair saw his candidate for mayor of Raleigh swamped by an effective and stealthy Democratic operation to boost voter turnout for its candidate of choice. \"When we woke up after the election,\" says Sinclair, \"we soon realized that Organizing for America [aligned with the Democratic National Committee] was heavily involved in these races, and what we found was it was a dry run for 2012.\" Sinclair says the Democrats did it the old-fashioned way: \"By identifying their base, and getting them out to the polls. From what I understand they knocked on 44,000 doors across this county [and] they shipped in volunteers from out of state to stay with their local volunteers to help bring out the votes, so it was very comprehensive.\" Obama was back in community organizer mode himself this week, with the launch of his first TV ad for the campaign. In the ad, aimed at recruiting volunteers, Obama says: \"It starts with one person making a decision ... and before long, neighborhoods come together. Communities organize. A movement builds.\" There's no doubt that over the long term, the growth in the numbers of Hispanics, young people and college graduates, paired with a decline in the numbers of white working class voters, favors the Democrats. The question for Obama is whether those trends are strong enough to offset the economic headwinds he faces now.",

Read Another Opinion On Obama's Campaign  Across a series of news articles (e.g., this story by Jackie Calmes and Mark Landler and this one by Jim Rutenberg), blog posts (e.g., this piece by Thomas Edsall and this one by Josh Kraushaar), and analyses (e.g., this paper by Ruy Teixeira and Joel Rogers), it has become clear how Team Obama sees a path to reelection. Essentially, it all comes down to three big goals: 1. Do as well with the non-white vote as Obama did in 2008, with the expectation that it continues to increase as a share of the total electorate. 2. Hold steady with upscale white voters, who tend to be more focused on quality of life issues like environmentalism. 3. Mitigate losses among the white working class, but expect to lose this group once again. So this would be a path to 270 electoral votes that might include Colorado, Nevada, and Virginia (which historically have been Republican) but not Ohio (a quadrennial swing state) or even Pennsylvania (which historically has been Democratic). Is this a feasible approach? At this point, it's not likely. I could go on at length about all of its problems, but let's just look at the three biggest dilemmas I see. 1. Obama still needs the \"white working class.\" Josh Kraushaar made a good point earlier this month when he discussed the Obama administration's decision on the Keystone XL Pipeline: The administration's decision to cater to environmentalists by postponing construction of the Keystone XL pipeline is a clear sign of the dilemma. The president decided to punt on a job stimulus measure in order to placate parts of the coalition that elected him in 2008. Environmental sensitivities took precedence over job creation. The problem with this approach is that the white working class is more essential to the Obama coalition than one might think. To appreciate this, consider the following chart, which identifies the percent of Obama's voting coalition that was white working class (defined here as whites without a college degree) in the Midwestern swing states.

            "article_content": "Many Coptic Christians in Alexandria are eying Egypt's first free parliamentary elections with trepidation. They fear things will only get worse for them if certain candidates win.  RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: It's MORNING EDITION from NPR News. Good morning. I'm Renee Montagne. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: And I'm Steve Inskeep. Voting has continued into a second day in Egypt. The complicated procedure will actually take weeks. So that means Egyptians will have to wait to learn what a parliamentary election really means for them and their lives. Voter turnout has been high so far, despite protests in the days leading up to the election. Many Egyptians say they are excited to vote in what many feel is the first real election in their lifetimes. But this country includes a large minority of Christians. And among those Coptic Christians, the thrill is mixed with anxiety over a predicted Islamist sweep of many of the seats up for grabs. NPR's Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson reports from the Egyptian city of Alexandria. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SORAYA SARHADDI NELSON, BYLINE: The anthem of the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party blasts from a campaign truck parked at a polling center in the working class neighborhood of Raml. (SOUNDBITE OF CROWD CHATTER) NELSON: Voters here shove past each other to get inside to cast ballots for the Brotherhood Party and other Islamist candidates. But Brotherhood officials are leaving nothing to chance. Scores of volunteers like Youssra Dakhakhny fan out across other neighborhoods where Islamist support is less assured. YOUSSRA DAKHAKHNY: (Foreign language spoken) NELSON: She talks to voters lined up outside of a polling center in a middle class enclave near Alexandria's waterfront. What she's doing violates official election rules, but the polling authorities don't stop her. Nearby, voter Camellia Lufti eyes the Brotherhood volunteer with trepidation. Lufti, who is a Coptic human rights activist and tax inspector, spent years fighting with Egyptian authorities over her teenaged twins' forced conversion to Islam after her husband switched religions. CAMELLIA LUFTI: (Foreign language spoken) NELSON: Lufti she says she fears a Brotherhood win will make life in Egypt even tougher for her minority Christian community, despite the Islamist group's assurances to the contrary. Her fear is shared by many Copts here who already felt under siege even when secularists like Hosni Mubarak were in power. They recall last New Year's Day when about two dozen parishioners leaving an Alexandria church were killed in a bombing. When Mubarak resigned six weeks later and Islamists emerged as a powerful political force, the Coptic community turned to the Egyptian generals who took over the country for help. But last month, Egyptian soldiers clashed with Coptic protestors in downtown Cairo. At least 27 people were killed, most of them Christians. The attack left Christians like 22-year-old university student Mina Samir feeling that no one in Egypt looks out for them. MINA SAMIR: (Foreign language spoken) NELSON: He says he no longer trusts the ruling military council, but still prefers the generals to the Islamists. He believes the Muslim Brotherhood will set Egypt back 500 years. Its political leaders across Egypt dismiss such fears as nonsense. The head of the Giza branch of the Freedom and Justice Party is Amr Darrag, who says that one of his vice-chairmen is Coptic. AMR DARRAG: There are so many Christians who are convinced with our reference and our way of approaching problems and they are willing to participate with us in our work towards, you know, having better Egypt, okay? (SOUNDBITE OF CROWD CHATTER) NELSON: At St. George Coptic Church in Alexandria, Nader Gabriel chooses not to worry about the projected Brotherhood victory. NADER GABRIEL: (Foreign language spoken) NELSON: He says he works with pious Muslims in his exporting business and has never had a problem. Like every parishioner interviewed here, Gabriel also says he will vote. Most say they will cast ballots for secular Muslims they feel can better protect their interests in Egypt. They add those candidates are stronger than any Coptic ones. Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson, NPR News, Alexandria. Copyright \u00a9 2011 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": " A man stands outside the international press center in Tunis on the eve of historic national election in Tunisia.  A man stands outside the international press center in Tunis on the eve of historic national election in Tunisia. Tunisians are voting Sunday in the country's first free and democratic election. The small North African nation was the first to overthrow its dictator last January in a popular movement that soon spread to other authoritarian Arab nations. Now, analysts say what happens in Tunisia will be key to whether democracy is to take root across the rest of the Arab world. Crowds were out on the streets of Tunis Sunday morning, and an underlying excitement filled the air of the capital city. For the first time in their country's history, Tunisians are going to the polls to vote for the candidate of their choice. \"It's my first time,\" said Ramsey Bislema as he stood in line at a polling station with a group of middle-aged men. It's a good feeling, he said, and something new for all of them. \"We didn't feel it before,\" he said, \"freedom and real democracy.\" Tunisians have lived under one-party, one-man rule since the country won its independence from France in 1956. Tunisians say the last 10 years under dictator Zine El Abidine Ben Ali were unbearable. In January Tunisia became the first Arab nation to overthrow its dictator. Social media played a huge role in that revolution, helping people to mobilize and pass on information. These days, sites like Facebook, YouTube and Twitter have been key to political parties getting their campaign messages out. A get-out-the-vote video airing on Tunisian television gives a feeling of the huge change the country is now going through. \"We were depressed, broken, terrified and exploited,\" says a voice, to scenes of despairing citizens. \"But now we are motivated, ambitious and optimistic. Our heads are up. Tunisia will vote.\" But with more than 100 parties and thousands of candidates to choose from, voting is not so easy. And some Tunisians say it's also a bit stressful. In a working class neighborhood of Tunis, another group of middle-aged men who grew up together sat outside their usual cafe. Before, they said, they could only talk about football. Now they can't stop arguing about politics. Mohammed Khelifa said the uncertainty was killing him. \"Some of us don't know who to choose, and it's a mystery who's going get the most votes,\" Khelifa said. \"Before, we always knew who would win, and I guess we kind of got used to that.\" Tunisians are electing a 217-seat assembly that will draft a new constitution as well as choose a president. One of the biggest political debates at cafes and dinner tables is how much support the Islamist Party will get. Thousands of people showed up at a campaign rally for the Islamist Party, called Ennahdha, on Friday. The excited crowd sang the Tunisian national anthem. Many people there said they trust the Islamists because of what they've been through. Under dictator Ben Ali, religious people were persecuted and jailed. Many Islamists fled into exile. Ennahdha says it wants to work within a democracy and has no intention of trying to impose Islamic rule, but many Tunisians fear the party has a hidden agenda. Tunisia is the Arab world's most moderate and modern country, and its large, secular segment of society is afraid of an overly religious influence in the new Tunisia. But political analyst Fare Mabrouk says it's normal for religious parties to be part of Tunisia's democracy. The biggest secular party, the Progressive Democratic Party, is also expected to get a lot of votes. Mabrouk says it's not the exact score, but the process that's important in the end. \"This is the first time an Arab country [has] tried to build a new democracy \u2014  an Arab democracy,\" Mabrouk says. \"The Arab world needs a successful transition to democracy, and I think Tunisia is the best candidate for that,\" he says. \"So we have here the conditions for this transition to succeed. So we need to succeed. We have no choice \u2014 not only for Tunisia, but also for rest of the Arab world.\"",

            "article_content": " Herman Cain shakes hands with a family at a Petersburg, Fla. book signing, Wednesday, Oct. 5, 2011.  Herman Cain shakes hands with a family at a Petersburg, Fla. book signing, Wednesday, Oct. 5, 2011. It's Herman Cain's moment. The surprise winner of Florida's recent GOP presidential straw poll has been featured on Page 1 of the New York Times. He's met with Donald Trump and sat down with The Wall Street Journal and the women of \"The View.\" He earned Gallup's highest candidate \"positive intensity\" score of this campaign season. And is enthusiastically hawking a new memoir (Herman Cain! My Journey to the White House) that's zooming up the bestseller lists. \"Momentum!\" the Cain campaign, which embraces the exclamation point, tweeted this week. Indeed, the Republican Party's fickle \"anybody-but-Mitt Romney\" crowd has a serious crush on Cain. For now. They've already pretty much chewed up and spit out Congresswoman Michele Bachmann, who won the August Iowa GOP straw poll. They've swallowed disappointment when New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie made good on his promise not to get into the race. Their once-intense ardor for Texas Gov. Rick Perry now feels very last month. So does former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, who has officially retreated to Wasilla, or Arizona, or wherever she's going to plot her next act. Why not hop on the Cain Train? The former Godfather's Pizza CEO, Baptist preacher and Atlanta radio host has parlayed a simple economic plan, a courtly straight-talking image, and disappointment in Perry into a national persona and attention he could not have dreamed of when confined to the bottom tier of the crowded GOP field just weeks ago. New national Republican presidential preference polls confirm the Herman Cain surge, the latest in a surge-y season for Republican White House hopefuls: CBS has him tied with former Massachusetts governor Romney at the top of the heap; Quinnipiac has him edging out Perry for second behind Romney. \"People genuinely like Herman Cain,\" says Republican strategist John Feehery. \"He's not a politician, and people are really sick of politicians.\" He's a very good speaker, able to fire up crowds, says Iowa pollster J. Ann Selzer, and offers \"an actual policy plank that's not too complicated.\" \"He's not as wonky as Romney or Santorum, not as scripted as Bachmann,\" Selzer says, referring to Rick Santorum, the former U.S. senator from Pennsylvania. \"He occupies that middle ground, with a policy people can understand, and a style that's refreshing and conversant.\" Says Andra Gillespie, a political scientist at Atlanta's Emory University: \"He's really captivated the Tea Party and part of the Republican establishment because of his candor, his frank, common-sense approach to things.\" \"He's always pointing to a plan,\" says Gillespie, \"and in a time of financial uncertainty, that confidence is reassuring.\" And Cain, 65, the only African American candidate in the GOP field, is not shy about injecting humor into his campaign, referring to himself as \"black walnut with substance\" ice cream after Palin recently characterized him as the GOP flavor of the week. A son of the segregated South, Cain also was the only Republican candidate who nicked Perry for a \"lack of sensitivity\" for leasing a Texas hunting camp that, according to a Washington Post report, had at its entrance a rock painted at one time with a name that included the \"n-word\" racial epithet. Cain, who has said that black voters have been \"brainwashed\" into voting for Democrats, made a point of saying the name out loud when asked about it on ABC. But despite his appeal, Selzer, Feehery, and plenty of other party insiders in early caucus and primary states predict that the Cain infatuation, too, will cool, as he and his policies are subjected to intense frontrunner scrutiny. \"Staying power? I don't think so,\" Feehery says. \"He doesn't have an organization to speak of. He has some money coming in, but it's not going to last. And he's gaffe prone.\" Cain displayed a glaring lack of knowledge about the Middle East during a Fox News interview several months ago when he was unaware of a central issue in Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations, the Palestinians' \"right of return\" demand. He said in a July interview that the United States recognizes the government of Taiwan, which it hasn't for more than two decades. And, Feehery says Cain is \"out on the edge\" when he insists, as he did again last Sunday on ABC's \"This Week,\" that \"some people would infuse Sharia law in our court system if we allow it.\" His 9-9-9 economic plan, a radical blueprint that would scrap the nation's current tax system and replace it with a flat 9 percent income tax, 9 percent corporate tax, and 9 percent consumption tax, has been roundly criticized as harmful to the poor and working class, and a scheme that would fail to raise the same revenue collected under current policy. Cain's strength now in national polls signify next to nothing going into a season of state-to-state contests, Selzer says, though the attention they bring may cause some people in the early states, including Iowa and New Hampshire, to take a second look at him. He likely will need some help in both of those key states, where he's been scarce. (His book tour has taken him to the crucial primary states of Florida and South Carolina.) It's too early to speculate on his White House chances, says Gillespie, author of Whose Black Politics? Cases in Post-Racial Black Leadership. \"But at the end of the day, his stock has risen,\" she says. Feehery predicts that while Cain's trajectory likely won't take him to the White House, he may have already guaranteed himself a cabinet position in a Republican administration. Cain, the author of three previous books, including They Think You're Stupid: Why Democrats Lost Your Vote and What Republicans Must Do to Keep It, certainly will sell more books, and, who know, maybe land a television gig. It's not unheard of. See: Fox, Palin, Mike Huckabee. So, really, all is quite well on the Cain Train.

            "article_content": "Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Warren officially began her Senate campaign in Massachusetts Wednesday. If Warren wins the Democratic nomination, she will challenge incumbent Republican Sen. Scott Brown next year. Warren faces a crowded field of Democrats vying for the nomination. National Democrats have made a priority of unseating Brown, who now occupies the seat held for decades by the late Sen. Edward M. Kennedy.  MICHELE NORRIS, Host: You're listening to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. Massachusetts has a new Democratic candidate for the U.S. Senate. Harvard law Professor Elizabeth Warren entered the race today to challenge Republican Senator Scott Brown. From member-station WBUR in Boston, Fred Thys reports. FRED THYS: Here's a measure of the buzz that Elizabeth Warren is generating in Massachusetts. Last night, Texas Governor Rick Perry, the Republican front-runner in the presidential race, was the main speaker at a dinner here. But Republicans at the event were talking about Warren's decision to run against Scott Brown. This morning, Warren greeted voters and recruited volunteers at a subway station in South Boston. ELIZABETH WARREN: It's very nice to see you. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: We cannot wait to work on your campaign. We're so excited. (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER) MAN: Oh, that's great. I'm delighted to hear that. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Very eager interns. WARREN: That's exactly what I need. MAN: Yeah. THYS: By shaking hands with voters, Warren is sending a signal that she is not Martha Coakley. Coakley was the Democratic Senate candidate who last year lost to Republican Scott Brown in a special election to replace the late Ted Kennedy. During that campaign, Brown had been outside of Boston's Fenway Park, greeting hockey fans at a rare outdoor game. When asked why she wasn't out there, Coakley replied: In the cold? Republicans are trying to paint Warren as an out-of-touch Harvard professor. So she was out there today, mingling. WARREN: This is fun. MAN: You think this is fun? WARREN: It's better than a congressional hearing. (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER) THYS: Warren has spent a lot of time in congressional hearings over the past few years, a champion for a consumer protection agency for financial services. WARREN: I've stood up to some pretty powerful interests over the last few years. I've gone toe to toe with them, and I didn't back down. In the case of the consumer agency, we actually won, even though people told us: You're going to be up against the biggest lobbying force assembled on the face of the Earth. No possible way you can win this. THYS: Republicans opposed her, and President Obama ended up finding someone else to run the agency. By kicking off her campaign in traditionally Irish South Boston, Warren is going after the working-class voters who supported Scott Brown. An AFL-CIO survey after the election found that half the union vote went to Brown. Carpenter Dennis Flaherty knows why Brown won. DENNIS FLAHERTY: He made a good impression here in South Boston. He made a lot of trips over here. I was shocked at how well Brown did. THYS: Across the street, Greg Nowak is taking part in a Boston morning ritual before heading over to his job in the financial district a few blocks away: He's ordering coffee at Dunkin' Donuts. Last year, Nowak voted for Scott Brown. What motivated you to support him? GREG NOWAK: To stop the health care passage, to be honest with you. That will do it. WOMAN: Can I help the next person, please? THYS: Brown promised to be an independent senator, and he sometimes bucks his own party on important votes. For example, he voted to repeal the \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy on gays in the military. Katherine Kinzel voted for Brown, too, but the 25-year-old researcher at the Brigham and Women's Hospital says she's open to Warren. KATHERINE KINZEL: She seems like a genuine person. So I'm still waiting to see what she has to say, how she plays out against the other Democratic candidates, just how she turns out to be a candidate, because there's still a long way to go. THYS: The primary is a year away, and six other Democrats are running. A recent poll for WBUR found that Warren does better than other candidates against Scott Brown. But Brown remains the most popular politician in the state. For NPR News, I'm Fred Thys in Boston. Copyright \u00a9 2011 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "When a president asks for a prime-time slot to address a joint session of Congress, he is signaling to the country that he has something very important to say. Next Thursday, President Obama will once again try to make a hard political pivot to the issue of jobs. Obama will confront two big problems when he stands in the well of the House next week. The first is political: the loss of voters' confidence in his handling of the economy. The second is the economy itself. A new estimate released by the White House on Thursday shows the economy growing at an anemic 1.7 percent and unemployment staying at 9 percent in 2012. \"He has to push forward a plausible, credible jobs package that will target that rate and start to finally bring it down,\" says Jared Bernstein, the former top economist for Vice President Joe Biden. Obama previewed the speech Monday, saying he would be \"laying out a series of steps that Congress can take immediately to put more money in the pockets of working families and middle-class families, to make it easier for small businesses to hire people, to put construction crews to work rebuilding our nation's roads and railways and airports, and all the other measures that can help to grow this economy.\" Possible 'Opening Gun' In 2012 Race The president's jobs package will almost certainly include measures for payroll tax relief, business tax credits for hiring and infrastructure projects. Bill Galston, a former aide to former President Clinton, says he thinks the president needs to go even bigger and lay out a growth agenda that includes a solution to the mortgage debt crisis and a long-term vision for fundamental tax reform. \"By going big, he will do what he really hasn't done so far in 2011, and that is plant a flag and invite the people to rally around it,\" he says. \"If you look at the speech that way, it really is the opening gun in the 2012 presidential campaign.\" The president would, in effect, be telling Americans what he would do if he had a second term. What his Democratic supporters desperately hope he does not do is lay out an agenda designed to win Republican support. AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka, is one of Obama's liberal supporters who thinks the president has been too fixated on bipartisanship and finding the magic set of policies that will appeal to Republicans in Congress. If you only propose what you think [Republicans] will accept, they control the agenda. AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka \"I said to him, 'Do not look at what is possible. Look at what is necessary, and just because you think it's the only thing that's politically possible, that doesn't mean you should propose that,' \" Trumka says. \"If you only propose what you think they will accept, they control the agenda.\" At this point, Republicans don't even seem open to proposals they once supported, like an extension of the payroll tax cut. Galston says it's time for the president to give up on his quest for economic solutions that are agreeable to both parties. \"Given where the energy is within today's Republican Party, the prospects of an agreement that is significant are almost zero,\" Galston says, \"which means that the president not only has no choice but to state his own position clearly and in unvarnished terms, but also that he can only gain from that.\" Obama can only \"gain,\" Galston says, because he's in such a deep hole. The number of people who view him as a strong leader has plummeted over the past two months. What He's Fighting For Galston and other Democrats think the only way out of that hole is to propose a bold plan and fight for it \u2014 even if it has no chance of passing Congress. \"If he has to choose between rebuilding his reputation as a strong leader and ticking off a menu of relatively modest legislative successes, I think that he would be well-advised to pursue the former even at the expense of the latter,\" Galston says, \"because right now, even his friends are wondering what he stands for and what he's prepared to fight for, and if even your friends aren't sure, then you can bet that the people who are in the middle \u2014 the independents and moderates who will decide the election \u2014 aren't sure, either.\" Ensuring that the American people know what he's fighting for is really the biggest task for the president next week and in the weeks after the speech, Bernstein says, as the president campaigns for his plan against Republican opposition. \"He will regain his footing precisely by doing just that, and I think that's where he's pivoting. This president can be extremely effective when he fights for what it is that people care most about in their economic lives: their living standards, their paychecks, the quality of their schools,\" Bernstein says. \"He lost his footing, he got distracted. He got sucked into a very destructive, self-inflicted, wounding debt-ceiling debate, and that's behind him now.\" The debt ceiling debate \u2014 where the president emerged looking weak and Washington utterly dysfunctional \u2014 is over, but the political damage it did hasn't gone away. Thursday's speech may be one of Obama's last big opportunities to reverse it.",

The business community and unions have pulled Obama in opposite directions over the last couple years. Organized labor is traditionally one of the strongest sources of money and organizing power for Democrats, but lately union leaders have strongly criticized President Obama. An event in the White House Rose Garden on Wednesday offered a perfect visual metaphor for the relationship between labor and the president. Obama was pushing Congress to reauthorize a transportation bill. To his left stood AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka, representing organized labor. To his right was an official from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, representing the business community that Obama has tried so hard to win over. Those two organizations have pulled the president in opposite directions for much of the past two years. Wednesday's photo-op aside, neither group is totally happy with where Obama is ending up. The business community complains that the White House is choking them with new regulations. The labor community says Obama is throwing working-class people overboard. At a recent breakfast hosted by The Christian Science Monitor newspaper, Trumka criticized Obama, saying without bolder action on the economy, the president \"doesn't become a leader anymore. He's being a follower.\" That criticism didn't surprise Kate Bronfenbrenner, a labor expert at Cornell University. \"The labor movement sees that he [Obama] keeps on acting as if he just moves further to the center, maybe then Republicans will stop being so intractable,\" she said. The dissatisfaction is not universal, though. SEIU President Mary Kay Henry points out that the president revived the U.S. auto industry, a big plus for American workers. \"There are points where we have disagreement on economic policy and we can't cut our way to reviving our economy,\" she said. \"So, yeah, there have been individual differences on policy, but I don't think for me that adds up to a frustration with the leadership of the president.\" To the president's critics in labor, the list of perceived offenses is long. There was the recent debt-ceiling deal, Obama's broken campaign promise to pass legislation that would simplify union organizing, and a White House senior staff with stronger ties to Wall Street than to labor. Just after the White House meeting Wednesday, Trumka attended a jobs event at AFL-CIO headquarters in Washington, D.C. This time he criticized the president without mentioning him by name. \"This is the time for boldness. This is a moment that working people will judge all of our leaders,\" he said. \"Will they propose solutions that are on the scale necessary to address the job crisis that America has right now?\" Obama plans to give a major speech next week where he'll  talk about helping Americans get back to work. Professor Harley Shaiken of the University of California,   Berkeley, says the speech could be critical. \"It could be the opening of a renewed effort on jobs that really gets labor excited, or it could be too little too late, which really increases the frustration,\" Shaiken said. \"It's going to be an important speech, and it will define where labor is on Election Day.\" White House spokesman Josh Earnest said he hopes the speech can also find common ground between workers and employers. \"It's the president's view that there are a lot of aligned interests here,\" he said, \"that there's an opportunity for us to put in place the kind of economic policies that could be supported by Democrats and Republicans, that could be supported by American businesses and American workers, that there are American communities all across the country that could benefit from these policies.\" At the U.S. Chamber of Commerce headquarters Wednesday, President and CEO Tom Donohue sounded open to that possibility. \"We're not going to be able to deal with the other challenges we face,\" he said, \"if we don't start to put people back to work to take them off the public payroll and have them paying taxes and driving confidence.\" To be sure, labor and business leaders have some very different ideas about how to create jobs. For example, the Chamber of Commerce supports some free-trade deals that the unions oppose. The president hopes that the dire unemployment situation will give both sides enough incentive to come together for more than just a moment in the Rose Garden.",

Rick Perry meets with business leaders at a lunch in Dubuque, Iowa, on Tuesday. As Gov. Rick Perry of Texas campaigns for the Republican presidential nomination, he's promoting his record in his home state, which has created more than 265,000 jobs in the past two years. Perry says he would do for the nation what he's done for the Lone Star State. The economy of Texas is growing at roughly twice the national average, but the question is: How much did Rick Perry and his low-tax, low-regulation philosophy influence that growth? If  you draw a rectangle on a piece of paper and put your pen in the bottom left-hand corner and then make a straight line across the box to the top right-hand corner, you've just drawn a graph of employment in Texas for the past 20 years. Really, that's what it looks like. From Gov. Ann Richards to Gov. George W. Bush to Gov. Rick Perry, the state has exploded in population and jobs. \"So it's not just the last 10 years; this has been going on now for 21 years \u2014 at least,\" says Richard Fisher, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. Fisher says population expansion is driving growth. Every day, about 1,000 people are either born in or move to Texas. That means new housing, roads, retail, schools, police, firemen \u2014 the list goes on. And while Perry touts the success of job creation in the private sector, job growth in government employment has been just as strong. \"We're growing at 80,000 schoolchildren a year, so those children are going to have to be accommodated,\" says Bill Hammond, the president of the Texas Association of Business. The oil and gas industry provided nearly 40,000 new jobs since 2009, and most pay good wages. A truck driver servicing an oil or natural gas rig earns on average $1,600 a week. Texas is also creating a lot of low-paying jobs. A new four-bedroom, three-bathroom house in a Dallas suburb can be bought for $189,000, and one reason is because immigrants, both legal and illegal, are willing to shingle those roofs in 100-degree heat for relatively low pay. Hammond says easy access to inexpensive labor has long been a critical part of the economy's success. \"If you look at agriculture, construction and hospitality, there's simply not enough people born in Texas, or across the country for that matter, to fill all those positions,\" Hammond says. So with all of these advantages, does Perry get any of the economic credit? Hammond says you bet. \"I think the governor's record is outstanding,\" he says. \"In his 10 years in office, we've seen enormous growth. Through his leadership, we were able to fill the budget gap without any new or additional taxes.\" Hammond and Perry say Texas is attractive to businesses because there's no corporate income tax, no state income tax, and environmental and other state regulations on Texas businesses are kept to a minimum. Critics reply that there's a big downside to these policies, as Texas ranks 44th in expenditures per public school pupil and 50th in the number of adults and children who have health insurance. Dick Lavine, a senior fiscal analyst with the Center for Public Policy Priorities, says the state is tied with Mississippi for the highest percentage of the workforce in minimum wage jobs. His group tracks legislation's impact on middle- and working-class Texans. \"To some extent, people in Texas just do without a lot of the public services that inhabitants of other states enjoy,\" Lavine says. An important talking point in Perry's campaign as it relates to his leadership on jobs is the Texas Enterprise Fund. This taxpayer fund was created at Perry's behest to give money directly to corporations as an inducement to either relocate to Texas or, if they're already in the state, to expand. Perry says that by giving away nearly a half-billion dollars, the fund will ultimately create nearly 60,000 jobs. The Enterprise Fund has come under attack, however. Texas Tea Partiers say funneling hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars to corporations and businesses is akin to President Obama's stimulus spending. And Texas newspapers like the Dallas Morning News and the Texas Observer have chronicled in detail how some of the companies receiving Enterprise Fund money have donated generously to Perry's campaign coffers. Perry's staff vigorously deny that there has been any quid pro quo. What is undeniable is that relative to the rest of the country, Texas is adding the most jobs by far. Unfortunately, it has not been enough. Texas' unemployment rate is at 8.2 percent, higher than the unemployment rate in the highly taxed, highly regulated state of New   York. It is also higher than the 7.6 percent unemployment rate of Massachusetts, with its near universal health care, the state once governed by GOP rival Mitt Romney.",

Of all the Tim Pawlenty facts, one of the most interesting has to be the one at the top of a Wall Street Journal piece by Neil King. Pawlenty, the former Minnesota governor who is running for the Republican presidential nomination, has not only never lived in another state; he has basically lived in the same part of his state his whole life. An excerpt: SOUTH ST. PAUL, Minn.\u2014Former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty brings a biographical peculiarity to his quest for the White House. Were he to win, he'd be the first president who had never lived outside his home state. In fact, Mr. Pawlenty has lived his entire life within a radius of 20 miles, a stark contrast to his more peripatetic Republican rivals and the current president. On the stump, Mr. Pawlenty uses that as a prime selling point. He is the working-class everyman, the son of a truck driver from a hardscrabble town who can win over swing voters in pivotal industrial states. This is remarkable. Such rootedness to a single place would be a fairly common occurrence in, say, the 18th and 19th centuries. But people who have the kind of success Pawlenty has \u2014 becoming governor of one a large Midwestern state \u2014 tend to be a bit more migratory than Pawlenty as they get schooling and establish their careers. It's interesting that Pawlenty is trying to sell his lack of moving about as a symbolic of his Everyman qualities. A lot of everyday people have lived in different places, like those in the military, for instance. And, of course, one White House occupant who rose from the common man to become perhaps our greatest president, Abraham Lincoln, was born in Kentucky, raised in Indiana and lived his adult years in Illinois before heading to Washington.",

Working-Class Roots Of course, these days it's also the land of the Tea Party's favorite congresswoman, Michele Bachmann. It's actually been awhile since Minnesota was reliably liberal, and Pawlenty's career parallels that shift from blue to purple. It's a career, he says, that got its spark not from any single political issue or event \u2014 but from a person. \"It really was Ronald Reagan,\" Pawlenty says. \"It really looked like America was in a mess, and here we had this strong, optimistic candidate emerge in the form of Ronald Reagan. And that was really the first experience I had with politics \u2014 and he really inspired me.\" Now, you might be thinking that's a safe answer. These days, even President Obama claims to be inspired by Reagan. But it wasn't such a safe answer 30 years ago in Pawlenty's blue-collar neighborhood in South St. Paul. As he recalls it, everybody there was a working-class Democrat \u2014 people who thought Republicans were out to get them. Pawlenty's uncle Virgil recalls the debates between young Tim and his father, Gene. Because he is so personally engaging and such a nice person, [Democrats] simply have to demonize his politics, because he can't be demonized personally. Attorney Dennis O'Brien \"It was a lot about the union, business and sometimes a little politics,\" he says. \"And they would have a back-and-forth, because Gene was a truck driver.\" At times, he was an unemployed truck driver. There were a lot of out-of-work people in South St.   Paul after the local stockyards shut down. Nationwide, many of these people eventually embraced Reagan \u2014 the \"Reagan Democrats\" of 1980, a political shift the teenage Tim Pawlenty got a jump on. And he wasn't shy about telling people what he thought, according to his aunt Judy. \"When he was in high school, I guess he questioned a lot of things. And like I say, he was very up on what was going on in the world,\" she says. \"So the kids started calling him 'senator,' and it just kind of stuck.\" Pawlenty's campaign says the nickname thing never happened. But you  hear the story a lot \u2014 it says something about local memories of young Tim's eagerness to move on to bigger and better things. A Religious Transformation Holy Trinity, the parish where Pawlenty grew up, is still in a lot of ways that old Minnesota \u2014 a church with a strong religious and ethnic identity, in this case, Polish Catholic. The liturgy is traditional, and the blue-haired ladies still hold coffee hour in the basement \u2014 just as they do in so many other Lutheran and Methodist and Presbyterian church basements. Former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty speaks at the Iowa Faith & Freedom Coalition Event in March in Waukee, Iowa. Five Republicans considering a run for president in 2012 presented themselves to hundreds of activists at the event.\n                \n                    \n                    Steve Pope/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty speaks at the Iowa Faith & Freedom Coalition Event in March in Waukee, Iowa. Five Republicans considering a run for president in 2012 presented themselves to hundreds of activists at the event. Midway through the Reagan administration, Pawlenty moved on to something a little more up to date: Wooddale Church, a Protestant megachurch with two campuses southwest of Minneapolis. Wooddale has everything Holy Trinity lacks \u2014 a real coffee shop, an 1,800-seat \"worship center\" and a sound system operated by a guy who used to work for Prince. This is post-Reagan Minnesota: suburban, nondenominational, post-ethnic and trending Republican. \"It was just the next step in his life and in his journey,\" says Leith Anderson, the senior pastor at Wooddale and president of the National Association of Evangelicals. Anderson still remembers talking to his wife after one of his early encounters with Pawlenty. \"I said, 'You know, I think he's really going to be a significant government leader.' And she said, 'Like what?' And I said, 'I don't know, like president of the United   States,' \" he says. \"I don't claim to be a prophet, but I was impressed.\" Minnesota's 'Fiscal Mess' Pawlenty has made an issue of his faith lately. His autobiography brims with Bible quotations, and the Almighty gets a shout-out in his Iowa stump speech: \"We need to be a nation that turns toward God, not away from God.\" To underscore the point, Pawlenty also tweeted that sentiment, nearly verbatim. But at the Minnesota Capitol, where Pawlenty spent two decades jousting with Democrats \u2014 first in the House, then as governor \u2014 religion rarely came up. \"You didn't hear that a lot in his rhetoric as governor,\" says Democratic state Sen. John Marty. He says the real struggle was about money \u2014 specifically, the governor's Reaganesque hostility toward taxes, which Marty believes led directly to the state's current $5 billion budget deficit. \"He's the first governor to leave the state with a fiscal mess,\" Marty says. Democrats say Pawlenty kept his no-new-taxes pledge by deferring needed investments in education and infrastructure, and that the bill is now coming due. Pawlenty's defenders, meanwhile, say it's not fair to blame him for the current fiscal crisis. \"The Democratic side of this equation has got a good story,\" says attorney Dennis O'Brien, who in the 1980s gave Pawlenty his first law job. \"But the low-tax, grow-the-economy, generate-revenue [viewpoint] is always a substantial, intellectually coherent perspective.\" O'Brien acknowledges there's still a lot of lingering anger at Pawlenty \u2014 \"rancor,\" he calls it. But he says it comes from the fact that Pawlenty has always been so politically frustrating for Minnesota liberals. \"Because he is so personally engaging and such a nice person,\" he says, \"they simply have to demonize his politics, because he can't be demonized personally.\" Another echo, perhaps, of Ronald Reagan \u2014 that personally engaging guy who so enraged Democrats three decades ago.",

When the histories of the current 112th Congress are finally written, maybe it all will become clear. But for right now, there seem to be many more questions than answers. For instance, why did House Republicans ever think it was a good idea to stake out a position on the payroll-tax issue that would leave them holding the bag for a new year's tax increase for 160 million workers? That has now been averted with Congress' passage Friday morning of a two-month extension of the current payroll-tax holiday. Also, how is it that Speaker John Boehner didn't force his freshmen to bend to political reality last weekend after the Senate overwhelmingly approved the extension, a deal that President Obama and Senate leaders had the impression Boehner initially supported? That would have spared himself and his party significant political damage. Instead, he allowed the freshmen and other hardliners to steer from the back, like those old fire department tiller trucks. Those trucks were prone to rollovers when the rear driver made a steering mistake. And the House GOP arguably found itself off its wheels, too. And how credible will Boehner be in future negotiations with President Obama and Democrats especially if, when he takes a particularly hardline stance, they can accuse him of once again being led by his freshmen to the brink of political disaster and say they will wait until he comes around? That last question is the one with the most immediate implications. The two-month extension means Congress and Obama will need to negotiate a longer-term deal to continue past February the tax holiday and other policies like federal unemployment insurance benefits and continued higher payments to doctors who accept Medicare patients. Boehner's position going into those negotiations has arguably been weakened after he and his House GOP were forced to back down from their position that they would not agree to a two-month extension. That doesn't mean the House Republicans can't regain their footing. But  they're definitely on wobbly legs right now. And Boehner's negotiating challenge will be tough. To get to a year-long deal, he and Obama will need to agree on how to pay for the longer tax holiday. Republicans had demanded higher Medicare premiums for Americans with higher household incomes and a pay freeze for federal workers. Democrats argued for tax increases on the very wealthy and the closing of corporate tax loopholes. The mishandling of the payroll tax fight only played into the hands of critics of Boehner and his fellow Republicans that the GOP is more concerned about the wealthy than the middle class. If Boehner and the GOP demand more sacrifice from middle class and lower income Americans in exchange for a one-year payroll tax cut extension, that would just make it easier for Democrats to make their populist arguments. Meanwhile, Boehner clearly has the challenge of deciding how to handle his House GOP conference going forward. If he allows the freshmen to keep steering, House Republicans could find themselves upended again. But preventing the kind of trouble House Republicans found themselves in this week could mean Boehner would need to run a far more top-down conference than he's so far been willing to do. Carrie Budoff Brown and Jonathan Allen of Politico.com report that when Boehner talked to his conference members on Thursday, he did all the talking, telling them a deal had been reached and that was that. \"This time there was no discussion. This time, House Speaker John Boehner didn't take the chance of losing another deal to a caucus with a tendency to self-immolate. \"And so when Boehner delivered the news that he had struck a deal on a Thursday afternoon conference call with House Republicans, the technology was in place to prevent rank-and-file lawmakers from voicing the kind of angry dissent that scuttled a Senate-passed payroll bill on Saturday. The five day drama that exposed both the political naivete of the freshman-heavy Republican Conference and the sharp limits of Boehner's power over them ended in silence.\" Obviously, this approach could invite a challenge to his leadership. But in the end, Boehner could decide that exerting more up front control over his conference will be worth the intramural trouble that could cause if it avoids the sort of damaging spectacle that occurred the week before Christmas 2011.",

            "article_content": "President Obama's speech in Osawatomie, Kan., on Tuesday laid out his vision of an active government that supports middle-class Americans.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: It's MORNING EDITION from NPR News. I'm Steve Inskeep. LINDA WERTHEIMER, BYLINE: And I'm Linda Wertheimer. It was a presidential speech intended to set the stage for next year's White House contest. Yesterday in Kansas, President Obama sought to present himself as the progressive heir to Teddy Roosevelt, the champion of a square deal for the middle class. INSKEEP: President Obama outlined two starkly different visions of the U.S. economy and the government's role in it. NPR's Scott Horsley reports. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Speaking at a small-town high school in Osawatomie, Kansas, President Obama talked about the values he learned from his Kansas-born mother and his grandparents; values shaped in the middle of the country, in the middle of the last century when prosperity was more widely shared and government programs, like the GI Bill, gave millions a chance to get ahead. Sadly, Mr. Obama said, for far too many Americans, it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel like we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in that Kansas anymore. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: For most Americans, the basic bargain that made this country great has eroded. Long before the recession hit, hard work stopped paying off for too many people. HORSLEY: Not only is wealth more concentrated in the hands of a few, but Mr. Obama complained that a child born in poverty today has less chance of making it into the middle class than a poor child born in the 1950s. He accused Republicans of suffering from collective amnesia, with their call for more tax cuts for the wealthy and less government regulation. OBAMA: And their philosophy is simple: We are better off when everybody is left to fend for themselves and play by their own rules. I am here to say: They are wrong. (SOUNDBITE OF APPLAUSE) HORSLEY: Mr. Obama offered his own, alternative vision, in which the government plays an active role: promoting education, policing the financial sector, and funding needed investments with higher taxes on the wealthy. OBAMA: In America, we are greater together when everyone engages in fair play, and everybody gets a fair shot, and everybody does their fair share. HORSLEY: Not so long ago, Mr. Obama says, these ideas were embraced by leaders across the political spectrum, including Republican Teddy Roosevelt. He gave his own speech in Osawatomie more than a century ago, and outlined a vision similar to the one Mr. Obama spelled out yesterday. OBAMA: This isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t about class warfare. This is about the nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s welfare. HORSLEY: Mr. Obama spoke for nearly an hour, and pulled together many of the ideas he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been talking about since well before the last election. But it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one thing to bemoan the plight of the middle class as a candidate, and something else when you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been in the White House for almost three years. With unemployment at 8.6 percent, many people feel just as insecure today, if not more so, than when Mr. Obama took office. Republican rival Mitt Romney told Fox News the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s policies are making things worse. MITT ROMNEY: We have a president three years in to his first term who has not laid out an economic plan to put Americans to work, and to rekindle our economy and to make us globally competitive. I find it extraordinary that this president has no vision for our economy. HORSLEY: Yesterday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s speech was meant to highlight the differences in vision that will help frame next year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s election. But the president also has his eye on more immediate battles - like whether to extend the payroll tax cut, and a fight in the Senate this week over his nominee to head a new financial watchdog agency. Republicans have been threatening to block the confirmation of Richard Cordray. The White House says without a confirmed director, the watchdog will have fewer teeth. OBAMA: Does anybody here think that the problem that led to our financial crisis was too much oversight of mortgage lenders or debt collectors? UNIDENTIFIED MAN: (Shouting) No! UNIDENTIFIED CROWD: (Shouting) No! OBAMA: Of course not. HORSLEY: Even with a full-court press by the White House, it seems unlikely Cordray will win Senate confirmation this week. But at what he calls a make-or- break moment for the middle class, Mr. Obama wants everyone on record saying which side they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re on. Scott Horsley, NPR News, Washington.

At the end of this month, a payroll tax cut is set to expire that the White House says would result in a tax increase of about $1,000 per year on most middle-class families. The benefit is popular with the American people, which may be one reason President Obama has been relentlessly promoting it. The president argues that extending the payroll tax \"holiday\" through 2012 is vital to the economy. Republicans in Congress are divided over that, but they strongly disagree with the president's plan to pay for it with a surtax on millionaires. For their part, the GOP presidential candidates have addressed the issue only glancingly. On a conservative radio program Monday, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney enthusiastically endorsed the renewal. \"I would like to see the payroll tax cut extended just because I know that working families are really feeling the pinch right now,\" he told talk show host Michael Medved. That's a stronger position than he took in Nashua, N.H., last month, when he said, \"Modest proposals are not going to get America's economy going again.\" Texas Rep. Ron Paul supports extending the tax cut too, according to a spokesman. And so does former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman, who told PBS he thinks the payroll tax cut \"is a good thing. I think it helps a whole lot of people, and I think it's something that would serve to stimulate this economy going forward.\" Other candidates are less enthusiastic. A spokesman for Rick Perry says the Texas governor does not support what he called \"short-term gimmicks.\" Mitt Romney (Yes) \"I would like to see the payroll tax cut extended just because I know that working families are really feeling the pinch right now \u2014 middle-class Americans are having a hard time,\" Romney told conservative radio host Michael Medved on Monday. Newt Gingrich (Maybe) The Gingrich campaign told NPR the former House speaker wants to phase out the payroll tax cut but did not specify how soon. Bloomberg Television reports that in a September interview, Gingrich backed an extension, saying: \"I am against tax increases in the middle of a depression.\" Ron Paul (Yes) The Texas congressman supports extending the payroll tax cut as long as it's not tied to any tax increases, a spokesman told NPR. Jon Huntsman (Yes) The former Utah governor supports extending the tax cuts but thinks it should be tied to broader tax reform, a spokesman told NPR. Rick Perry (Maybe) A spokeswoman did not give a direct \"yes\" or \"no\" answer but implied the Texas governor does not support an extension: \"Gov. Perry believes we need long-term fundamental tax reform, not short-term gimmicks for a bigger problem.\" Michele Bachmann (No) The Minnesota congresswoman opposed the tax breaks last year in Congress and says she cannot support an extension this year. \"Why would we continue something that isn't working and that is taking $111 billion away from senior citizens when they need that money in the Social Security trust fund?\" she said Sunday on CNN's State of the Union. Rick Santorum (Unclear) The former Pennsylvania senator's campaign did not respond to NPR requests for the candidate's position on the issue. -- Natalie Friedman The Newt Gingrich campaign says the former House speaker plans to phase out the payroll tax cut but did not specify when. And Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann told CNN that since the tax cut didn't create jobs, it should end. \"This payroll tax deduction didn't do what President Obama promised,\" she said. \"Why would we continue something that isn't working?\" For candidates who support renewing the benefit, the trickier question is how to pay for it. None of the campaigns gave an exact accounting of where the money would come from. Almost all of them say how they would not fund the extension: As Romney put it in Nashua, \"I don't want to raise taxes on anybody.\" Michael Franc, vice president for government studies at the conservative Heritage Foundation, says it's not surprising that candidates are reluctant to wade into the details of this debate. Would-be presidents would rather focus on the big picture. \"What they're trying to do with the voters is say, 'Here's my value system, here's how I would apply it, here's what I would do,' whether it's to the tax code or to entitlement programs or to spending trajectories in general,\" Franc says. So many of the candidates quickly shift from talking about the payroll tax cut to the bigger issue of fundamental tax reform \u2014 overhauling the system to make it cleaner and simpler, with fewer loopholes and patches. Franc says the real problem is that a record number of provisions in the U.S. tax code now have expiration dates. \"It's kind of like in your household budget,\" he says. \"If you had to renegotiate your cable contract or your budget every month, that would pretty much preclude you from dealing with longer-term family budgetary issues or investment decisions.\" Leaders of both parties agree that this is a major issue, so a fundamental tax overhaul is on everybody's to-do list. But when Congress can't even agree on how to resolve these short-term tax debates, solutions to the long-term issues seem more unattainable than ever.",

NPR's Liz Halloran runs through the possible scenarios and concludes that only thing seems certain: We're in for \"a long election-year debate over the Bush tax cuts, and a clear party divide  over who pays to reduce the nation's deficit \u2014 and how.\" The Hill thinks \"the supercommittee's deadlock gives leaders in both parties plenty of ammunition  for the 2012 campaign,\" and not just in the race for the White House. \"Senate Republicans say they will use the supercommittee debate to target  vulnerable Democrats. ... Democrats will use the supercommittee's deliberations to bolster their  argument that Republicans want to slash programs that help the middle class to  protect the rich from paying \"their fair share.\" And, as The Wall Street Journal says, the collapse of the supercommittee's effort \"clears the way for a yearlong legislative battle over whether to block [automatic spending] cuts or to replace them with another broad deficit-reduction plan.\" The New York Times finds a glimmer of good news: \" 'There could be a bit of a silver lining,' said Rosanne Altshuler, an  economist at Rutgers University who served on President George W. Bush's 2005  tax reform panel. 'It forces us to come to terms with cuts in areas that have  been difficult to touch \u2014 the military and Medicare.  We may not like how the cuts are going to be done, but we better start dealing  with the fact that cuts are going to have to be made.' \"",

John Kerry with other members of the deficit reduction panel on Monday. For the not-so-super debt reduction supercommittee, failure is clearly an option. As the blame-gaming bipartisan congressional committee stumbled toward collapse Monday, washing out on even the most basic show of common purpose, the \"what happens next\" scenarios began to take shape. Markets reacted with initial alarm at the prospect of yet another sign of the deep dysfunction in Washington. The Dow Jones industrial average closed down nearly 250 points Monday, as investors \u2014 who just months ago saw Republicans in Congress push the nation to the brink of default during a debt debate \u2014 again reacted. With elected officials in Congress preparing to wave the surrender flag and hustle home for the Thanksgiving holiday, here's a look at four potential consequences of the latest Washington disappointment: 1. Let The Automatic Cuts Begin The supercommittee was born when a deeply divided Congress failed to agree on a plan to reduce the nation's ballooning deficit earlier this year. Co-chaired by Democratic Sen. Patty Murray of Washington and GOP Rep. Jeb Hensarling of Texas, the panel was charged by law with coming up with a bipartisan bill that would cut the federal deficit by $1.5 trillion over the next decade. The committee's failure to meet a pre-Thanksgiving deadline will trigger $1.2 trillion in automatic spending cuts beginning in 2013 and through 2021, with half coming from domestic programs and half from the defense budget. Programs exempt from automatic cuts include Social Security, Medicaid and food stamps; cuts to Medicare are capped at 2 percent. The $1.2 trillion represents about 10 percent of the nation's collective deficit of more than $10 trillion through 2021, according to Craig Jennings, director of federal fiscal policy at OMB Watch. He notes that with interest savings factored in, the actual triggered cuts will be closer to $980 billion. In terms of a hard number, \"it doesn't get you very far,\" Jennings says, but still will touch many programs. 2. Or Change The Rules But with the automatic cuts not slated to go into effect for more than a year, legislators have already begun to fashion bills to protect certain programs. Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona, for example, is working on one that would limit military spending cuts. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, in a letter last week to McCain, the ranking GOP member of the Armed Services Committee, characterized the prospect of rapid, triggered cuts as \"devastating.\" Congress could pass a law allowing it to back out of the  automatic cuts. Or it could push all the cuts to the domestic side of the  ledger, or back out of the triggered defense cuts altogether. But President Obama has told supercommittee members that he will not accept changes that water down the triggered cuts, so the prospects for these laws remain murky at best. 3. Trade Defense Cuts For Tax Cuts With the supercommittee winding down, many see the deficit-cutting debate as reverting to what it's always been about: the Bush-era tax cuts. The Congressional Budget Office calculates that if the Bush tax cuts, extended last year through 2012 in a budget agreement forged by Obama, are again extended, the deficit would increase by $3.3 trillion through 2012. That number increases to $4.6 trillion if inflation indexing and other factors are taken into account. With the tax-cut extension set to expire at the same time the automatic cuts are scheduled to begin, Congress watchers speculate that negotiations now will involve horse-trading over defense spending and rollbacks on Bush tax cuts for the wealthy. But the timing suggests that a plausible scenario could be one in which Bush-era tax cuts for the middle class are extended, in exchange for a deal on defense cuts. 4. Take The Issue On The Road The debate will continue into January, when Obama introduces his 2013 budget and the Republican nominating process kicks into high gear. So far, Republicans are adopting different strategies. Former GOP House Speaker Newt Gingrich,  surging in recent polls, characterized the committee's mission collapse  as \"good for America.\" Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney assailed Obama for the supercommittee's collapse. The one thing that the supercommittee's tired expiration appears to guarantee is a long election-year debate over the Bush tax cuts, and a clear party divide over who pays to reduce the nation's deficit \u2014 and how.",

            "article_content": " Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain speaks at the National Press Club on Monday.  Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain speaks at the National Press Club on Monday. Republican presidential front-runner Herman Cain has stumbled before, and on big issues ranging from his position on legal abortion to the effects of his radical flat tax plan on the poor and middle class. But his response to a Politico report that he faced two sexual harassment complaints that were settled with cash payments more than a decade ago presents a new kind of threat to his cometlike ascendancy in the Republican race. \"He has surged in the polls because he had a clear economic message,\" says conservative pollster and strategist Kristen Soltis. \"This is a huge obstacle for staying on that message.\" Cain is essentially tied for the lead in two major new polls, one out of Iowa, where the primary and caucus season kicks off Jan. 3, and one out of Texas, where he is running even with that state's governor, Rick Perry, in the race for the GOP presidential nomination. Soltis' advice to Cain? Get the truth out because, as always, she says, \"the longer it's strung out, the more damaging it becomes.\" Cain's attempts to get out his version of what happened with the two women who worked for him when he headed the National Restaurant Association in the late 1990s, however, have only raised more questions, including those of his own veracity. Campaign officials first attempted to discredit the story with a blame-it-on-the-Beltway-media gambit. Then Cain himself declared Monday on Fox News that he had been \"falsely accused\" of harassment when he headed the National Restaurant Association. In later comments at the National Press Club, Cain said he was a victim of a \"witch hunt.\" And the settlements with the women? If there were agreements, Cain said, he \"wasn't aware of it.\" They would have been handled by \"people who worked for me,\" he said. \"I am not aware of a settlement that came out of\" the accusations, he said, adding that he \"recused\" himself from settlement deliberations, leaving the work to his general counsel and human resources official. Cain's claims of ignorance about financial settlements with the complainants have struck employment law experts as highly improbable. For Cain not to have known that the association settled sexual harassment complaints against him \"would be highly unusual, extremely unlikely, and I would be shocked if that were the case,\" says Patricia Barasch, president of the National Employment Lawyers Association. Bruce Fredrickson, a Washington-based employment lawyer, had a similar take. If the women's complaints were directly against Cain, which the Politico story alleges, \"his account would be rather implausible to me,\" said Fredrickson, past president of the National Employment Lawyers Association, particularly if the complaints were resolved with a monetary settlement. Politico characterized  Cain's alleged inappropriate behavior as ranging from conversations \"filled with  innuendo or personal questions of a sexually suggestive nature\" to physical  gestures the women \"regarded as improper in a professional  relationship.\" Cain's account would become even more questionable if the women had pursued their complaints through the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, or through the courts. In an interview Monday with Bloomberg News, Cain said that the EEOC had investigated allegations he sexually harassed an employee and found \"no basis\" to pursue the case. Cain's assertion that he was falsely accused by the women could also violate the settlement's nondisclosure agreement, say employment law experts, depending on how that agreement was written. A typical resolution often prevents both parties from discussing the underlying allegations that led to the settlement, permitting only a public acknowledgment that the matter has been settled to the satisfaction of the parties, according to employment lawyers. Sometimes, however, confidentiality agreements only restrict the person making the complaint. If the association's settlement with the women also included a non-disparagement clause, his statements that essentially accuse the women of lying could also violate the terms of the agreement. Cain headed Godfather's Pizza before taking the helm of the National Restaurant Association in 1996. He left the lobbying group in 1999. The women involved in the sexual harassment complaints against Cain have been bound by a nondisclosure agreement signed as part of the settlement, according to Politico. GOP strategist Ed Rogers characterized Cain's past 12 hours as \"the definition of off message.\" \"We are going to find out who the accusers are,\" Rogers said. \"We are going to find out if there's any paperwork. The usual suspects will howl that this disqualifies him, and some will say the political statute of limitations has run out.\" Rogers dismisses suggestions that another Republican presidential candidate may be behind the harassment revelations. Cain is a \"placeholder\" in the polls, Rogers says, a candidate for people waiting to commit to another. \"Any campaign would be terrified of getting caught \u2014 and [former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt] Romney, in particular, has to \"handle Cain gently,\" Rogers says. \"He needs to be the second choice of Cain supporters.\" Rogers advises Cain to \"be still,\" and let his campaign manager talk about the issue off-camera. \"Let the wave of this crest over him,\" Rogers says. Given the events of Monday, and Cain's explanation \u2014 found wanting by a range of conservatives, including the president of Concerned Women for America \u2014 that wave won't be cresting for awhile.",

            "article_content": "Republican presidential contender Rick Perry backed a flat tax plan Tuesday. It's an idea that has been around for some time. But it now appears to be gaining traction within the GOP.  RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: This is MORNING EDITION from NPR News. I'm Renee Montagne. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: And I'm Ari Shapiro, sitting in for Steve Inskeep who's visiting Oregon Public Broadcasting in my hometown of Portland. Republican presidential candidate Rick Perry says he knows how to unleash the U.S. economy and balance the federal budget at the same time. The centerpiece of his plan is a single, optional, income tax rate of 20 percent. The Texas Governor outlined his proposal yesterday in South Carolina, which holds its Republican primary early next year. As NPR's Scott Horsley reports, flat taxes seem to be gaining traction in the GOP. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: When it comes to revving up Republican voters, the tax plan popularized by Herman Cain has been anything but flat. HERMAN CAIN: The 9-9-9 plan that I have proposed is simple, transparent, efficient, fair and neutral. HORSLEY: And evidently contagious. Joseph Thorndike, who directs the non-partisan Tax History Project, says now that Cain has jumped to the top tier in Republican polls, other GOP hopefuls are rushing to play catch up. JOSEPH THORNDIKE: Herman Cain has really changed the debate, I think. I didn't really think that his plan would ever rise above the level of being treated as a gimmick. But people have really latched on to his idea. HORSLEY: Rick Perry jumped in yesterday with his 20 percent flat tax option. And Newt Gingrich is suggesting a flat tax of 15 percent. Still, if Cain's success shows the intuitive appeal of a flat tax, Thorndike says it also demonstrates the hazard of bumper-sticker economics. THORNDIKE: When he starts out with a 9-9-9 and everyone says this is horribly regressive, and he says, well, actually I meant a 9-0-9 for people under a certain amount of income. And I'm telling you that's not the last change that Herman Cain is going to have to make in the 9-9-9, or anybody. Because to make taxes work well, to some extent you have to make them a little more complicated. HORSLEY: Tax analysts warned that Cain's original plan would have resulted in more than three out of four families paying higher taxes. So when Perry introduced his plan yesterday, he included an option: taxpayers can pay under the current tax code, or his 20 percent flat tax, whichever results in a smaller bill. RICK PERRY: We need a tax code that unleashes growth instead of preventing it. That promotes fairness, not class warfare. HORSLEY: Perry's plan would also cut corporate tax rates to 20 percent, and eliminate the tax on dividends and capital gains. By doing away with those investment taxes, Perry would give a big windfall to the wealthiest Americans. Thorndike notes Ronald Reagan went the opposite direction, taxing earnings from capital at the same rate as ordinary income. THORNDIKE: I mean, Ronald Reagan, when he was trying to sell his tax reform plan, you know, he said this is going to be fair, because the rich people are going to pay at the same rate as the bus driver. And that issue about the taxation of capital gains was at the heart of the bargain. And we're nowhere near that kind of a bargain now. HORSLEY: Bruce Bartlett was a policy advisor in the Reagan White House and the author of a forthcoming book on taxes called \"The Benefit and the Burden.\" He says the idea behind today's progressive tax code, in which the wealthy are taxed at a higher rate, has lost ground since the 1980s. BRUCE BARTLETT: People have come to believe that it's OK for very rich people to pay virtually nothing. And they seem not to care when people like Herman Cain talk about massively raising taxes on the poor and the middle class. This is really quite astounding because there are certainly far more poor and middle class people in this country than there are rich people. But many people who would be worse off appear to support them. HORSLEY: Thus far, Mitt Romney has steered clear of the flat tax bandwagon. Romney does want to do away with taxes on dividends and capital gains, but only for those making less than $200,000. And while he favors a simplified tax code, Romney says Cain's proposal goes too far. MITT ROMNEY: I've had the experience in my life of taking on some tough problems. And I must admit that simple answers are always very helpful, but often times inadequate. HORSLEY: Back in the 1990s, Romney denounced another flat tax proposal from publisher Steve Forbes as a tax cut for fat cats. Today, Forbes is advising Rick Perry. And Perry told CNBC, he considers Romney to be a fat cat. Scott Horsley, NPR News, Washington. Copyright \u00a9 2011 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "Republican presidential hopeful Rick Perry is in South Carolina, where he'll deliver a speech on economic policy and his approach to a flat tax Tuesday. The Texas governor has brought on some new senior staff and is preparing a new round of TV ads in an effort to revive his campaign.  RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: Let's hear, now, about Republican presidential hopeful, Rick Perry, who'll be in South Carolina this morning, to outline his plan for a flat tax. As NPR's Mara Liasson reports, it's just one of the moves the Texas Governor is making to revive his campaign. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Rick Perry has hired new staff, prepared a round of television ads and launched a new attack on Mitt Romney for allowing illegal immigrants to get free health care in Massachusetts. And today in South Carolina, Perry will try to show he is the anti-establishment candidate in the race - by laying out a proposal for a radical rewrite of the tax code that he says will create jobs, growth, and investor confidence. RICK PERRY REPUBLCIAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I want to make the tax code so simple that even Timothy Geithner can file his taxes on time. LIASSON: Mitt Romney is on record opposing a flat tax - for many of the same reasons that Democrats do. Romney once called a flat tax plan from Steve Forbes, - who endorsed Perry yesterday - a tax cut for fat cats. So Perry's plan could set off the first real ideological debate of the Republican primary. Republican strategist Mike Murphy says it also represents an overdue effort by Perry to lay out the building blocks of a presidential campaign. MIKE MURPHY: So far he's been very light on policy, Romney's put out a pretty detailed plan, but his plan is basic conservative economics, it's not revolutionary, because Romney has one eye on the general election. So, we want to see what the Perry plan is - the balance between ideological purity and policy pragmatism. LIASSON: In the past, flat tax proposals have sounded good on paper, but when middle class taxpayers get out their calculators they sour on them, because most flat tax plans raise taxes on the middle class. But supply side conservatives don't value progressivity in the tax code, what they want is economic growth. And this year, a big chunk of the Republican Party is in the mood for bold, even radical reform. Still it might take more than a carefully crafted tax plan to lift Perry's campaign, after entering the race at the top of the pack, he's now polling in single digits in Iowa and New Hampshire.

            "article_content": "GOP presidential contender Herman Cain, who has made his reputation with his 9-9-9 tax plan, introduced the variant 9-0-9 plan for the poor, who would be exempt from the income portion of the plan. Experts said the poor, who pay little if any federal tax now, would still see a tax hike.  ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain's 9-9-9 tax plan has taken a lot of heat recently. Several independent analysts have found that under the plan, poor and middle-class families will pay higher taxes. And what's more, they say, the richest will see a substantial tax cut. Well, today in Detroit, Cain unveiled his response. NPR's Tamara Keith reports. TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Cain's 9-9-9 plan would scrap the current tax code and replace it with a 9 percent business tax, a 9 percent income tax, and a 9 percent national sales tax. HERMAN CAIN: Nine-nine-nine means jobs, jobs, jobs. KEITH: Cain stood before a giant, abandoned building - a symbol of urban blight and decay - to roll out the details of his plan to help distressed inner cities and poor people. For the poor, income taxes would be zeroed out. CAIN: If you're at or below the poverty level, your plan isn't 9-9-9. It's 9-0-9. Say amen, y'all. UNIDENTIFIED GROUP: Amen. CAIN: Nine-zero-nine. KEITH: Roberton Williams, with the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, says even with this change, the lowest-income Americans would see their tax bills rise because the business tax would trickle down to them and... ROBERTON WILLIAMS: You would still have the sales tax, 9 percent on every dollar people spend. And for poor families, that's a deal-breaker. KEITH: For cities, Cain introduced the concept of opportunity zones - areas where there would be special tax advantages to encourage businesses to hire. It's unclear whether the plan would generate enough tax revenue after these changes, though Cain insists it remains revenue neutral. Tamara Keith, NPR News. Copyright \u00a9 2011 NPR.

            "article_content": " PolitiFact's \"Barely True\" rating. In an interview for Wednesday's All Things Considered, Bill Adair, editor of PolitiFact.com and Washington bureau chief for the St. Petersburg Times, will talk about how candidates at Tuesday night's GOP debate rated on PolitiFact's Truth-O-Meter. In the meantime, PolitiFact staff writer Aaron Sharockman has truth-squadded some of the candidates' statements for PolitiFact.com and It's All Politics: Boosted by his newly minted front-runner status, Republican  presidential candidate Herman Cain bounced into Tuesday's GOP debate in  Las Vegas as the latest possible conservative foil to Mitt Romney. So ... naturally Cain and his \"9-9-9\" tax plan became the immediate  focus of attacks from the group of Republicans hoping to knock him off  stride. His 9-9-9 plan, Cain says, is the first step to creating a national flat or  \"fair\" tax. It would replace the current complicated tax system with 9  percent personal income tax, a 9 percent national sales tax and a 9  percent tax on businesses. Unlike the current system, Cain's plan  includes relatively few opportunities for people or businesses to claim  deductions or write off expenses. The personal income tax, for example,  would include only two potential exemptions \u2014 people could write off  donations to charity and tax filers would get a break for living in  impoverished inner cities. Cain's national sales tax would be on top of  state and local sales taxes. (You can read a more detailed background of the plan here.) More people have started to criticize Cain's plan, saying it's a  regressive series of taxes that will force poorer and middle-class  Americans to pay more in federal taxes. After an initial attack from U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann Tuesday, Cain  responded to CNN moderator Anderson Cooper by saying that 9-9-9 \"does  not raise taxes on those that are making the least.\" That, he said, is  \"simply not true.\" However, a PolitiFact analysis of Cain's plan \u2014 relying on three different tax accountants \u2014 found a similar statement Mostly False. The debate then turned to health care \u2014 and Romney's role in pushing  changes to Massachusetts' health care laws while he served as governor.  Romney tried to deflect criticism by noting that state residents support  the change by a 3 to 1 margin. That claim rates True. Romney also pointed out that former U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich  supported an individual mandate, the now controversial part of President  Barack Obama's health care law. Republicans, it turns out, actually proposed an individual mandate back in 1993. As the debate pivoted to illegal immigration, Texas Gov. Rick Perry  accused Romney of hiring illegal immigrants, a claim that Romney  strongly denied. \"You had illegals working on your property,\" Perry  said. Romney said he hasn't employed an illegal alien, a claim we rated Mostly False. Bachmann made a series of claims about the cost of illegal immigration.  While her numbers are new to us, including a figure that every  household pays $1,000 to support illegal immigrants, our state partners  have looked into the cost of illegal immigration before. Often, the claims are overstated (Florida). (Ohio.) (Georgia.) The debate then turned to a concern of Nevadans, a plan to store  nuclear waste at site at Yucca Mountain. U.S. Rep. Ron Paul and Romney  said they opposed the plan, saying the federal government shouldn't tell  Nevada that it has to store nuclear waste from across the country. You can read a good background on the plan, told through a claim from Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada. From there, talk turned quickly to the Troubled Asset Relief Program,  better known as TARP, which passed in 2008. Former U.S. Sen. Rick  Santorum said the plan was a mistake and criticized Perry for supporting  it. Perry said Santorum had his facts wrong. Our friends looked at a  similar statement from Perry about his non-support for TARP and ruled it Half True. When an audience member asked why the United States continues to give foreign  aid, Perry said the country needed to have a \"real debate\" about  cutting foreign aid spending. As PolitiFact previously has noted,  foreign aid currently makes up 1 percent of the federal budget, with  Israel receiving a significant chunk of the support in military and  economic aid. Romney, Perry and Santorum later played a game of who used to be more  liberal (though no one was accusing Santorum of being liberal). Romney  pointed out that Perry chaired Al Gore's campaign for president. We  rated a similar claim from Bachmann Half True.  And Santorum said Romney ran for office in 1994 to the left of former  U.S. Sen. Ted Kennedy. Though Santorum's claim lacks some of the nuance,  the Truth-O-Meter actually heard a similar statement back in 2007 from  former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani. \"He's (Romney) the one who said that he would be to the left of Teddy Kennedy on gay rights,\" Giuliani said back in 2007. That specific claim rated Mostly True.",

            "article_content": "American college student Amanda Knox will return to Seattle now that an Italian appeals court has overturned her 2009 conviction for murder. For the last four years, Knox has benefited from a tireless public relations campaign on her behalf. The Seattle group \"Friends of Amanda\" has kept her name in the media.  DAVID GREENE, Host: College student Amanda Knox is returning to her hometown of Seattle today. An Italian appeals court yesterday overturned her 2009 murder conviction. For the last four years, the Knox case has been has been a cause celebre in three countries: Italy, the U.S. and the U.K., the home country of murder victim Meredith Kercher. As NPR's Martin Kaste reports, 24-year-old Amanda Knox has benefited from a tireless public relations campaign on her behalf. MARTIN KASTE: Here in Seattle, the group calling itself Friends of Amanda rented a suite in a downtown hotel to watch the verdict. (SOUNDBITE OF CHEERS) KASTE: And if the cheers were hesitant at first, it was only because of the uncertain translation of the Italian legalese. Soon enough, the cheers were replaced by tears of joy. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: We did it. We did it, you guys. We did it. We did it! KASTE: Reporter Barbie Latza Nadeau wrote a book about the case. She recalls how the prosecutor and the Italian media initially portrayed Knox as a cold-blooded, American party girl. BARBIE NADEAU: And at that time, after she'd been arrested, her parents - with the help of some supporters in Seattle - decided they needed to take control of the story, and take control of her image. So they started the Friends of Amanda group. And they were - they really, I think, did an effective job at controlling the media and controlling the message. KASTE: Nadeau says that message control eventually trickled into the Italian media, and may have influenced the outcome. NADEAU: The jury had to walk through the giant media scrum on their way to court every day. The local Perugian papers printed stories constantly about how the American supporters of Amanda Knox were looking down on their city, down on their judiciary, down on their investigators, and things like that. And I think it would have been really difficult for this jury not to feel pressure. KASTE: The family of murder victim Meredith Kercher felt the need to hold their own news conference before the verdict. Her brother, Lyle Kercher, implied that the trial had become a publicity war. LYLE KERCHER: There comes a point where obviously, it's difficult for our legal team, who work very hard and do a lot of good work out here, to be constantly battling against what's essentially a large P.R. machine, for want of a better term. KASTE: Back in Seattle, Friends of Amanda organizer Tom Wright insists that the credit for the acquittal goes to Knox and her co-defendant, her former boyfriend. Wright says they made their own case in their statements to the court. TOM WRIGHT: I think it was jarring to the Italians who had launched this campaign against these kids, to see them for real, speaking from the heart. And that they couldn't - they said(ph) how did we incarcerate these - these children? How did that happen? KASTE: And Joe Starr, a friend of Knox's father's, dismisses the talk of media manipulation. JOE STARR: There was no big P.R. campaign. You heard this over and over and over. This is just a middle-class family. We're just regular people. KASTE: Martin Kaste, NPR news, Seattle.

President Obama's re-election may all come down to whether voters mainly view the 2012 race seen as a referendum on his presidency or a choice between competing Democratic and Republican prescriptions for how to best address the nation's economic and fiscal challenges. If it's a referendum, it could well be curtains for his hopes of a second term because the economy is clearly making too many voters unhappy and scared. But if it's a choice, Obama could win by persuading enough voters that his preferred approach, with its balance of spending cuts and higher taxes on the wealthy, is closer to their values. Thus, the president's $3 trillion deficit reduction plan announced Monday, his administration's recommendations to the congressional super committee, is aimed at framing the 2012 election as a choice. Obama's argument is that while he wants the same as most Americans based on polling, Republicans would let the burden of deficit reduction fall on the poor and middle class and oppose any effort to raise taxes on millionaires, billionaires and corporations. The choice comes down to which side of the \"Warren Buffett Rule\" line one stands on. As the billionaire investor Buffett has repeatedly and famously observed, because of tax breaks available to the superwealthy, his effective tax rate is lower than his secretary's. Both Buffett and Obama think that's monumentally unfair. And Obama is betting that most voters will see it that way, too. In a speech from the White House Rose Garden Monday, Obama made clear that he intends to keep Republicans on the defensive over a tax code biased towards the superwealthy, a code under which middle-income taxpayers are faced with tax rates of 23 percent to 33 percent while superwealthy hedge fund managers can have rates of 15 percent. OBAMA: It is wrong that in the United States of America, a teacher or a nurse or a construction worker who earns $50,000 should pay higher tax rates than somebody pulling in $50 million.  Anybody who says we can't change the tax code to correct that, anyone who has signed some pledge to protect every single tax loophole so long as they live, they should be called out.  They should have to defend that unfairness.  Explain why somebody who's making $50 million a year in the financial markets should be paying 15 percent on their taxes when a teacher making $50,000 a year is paying more than that, paying a higher rate. They ought to have to answer for that. And if they're pledged to keep that kind of unfairness in place, they should remember \u2014 the last time I checked, the only pledge that really matters is the pledge we take to uphold the Constitution. It was an allusion to anti-tax activist Grover Norquist's pledge, signed by virtually all congressional Republicans and some Democrats, against increasing tax rates or reducing deductions. Obama was making it clear to Republicans that he had his own version of the \"You're either with us or against us\" statement invoked during the previous administration. However, he was would be using it on fiscal and economic, not national security, matters. \"Us\" in this case refers to most voters who aren't superwealthy and those among the highest earners, like Buffett, who want higher rates for those who get much of their income from capital gains instead of wages. In response to Republican criticisms that what he advocated amounted to class warfare, Obama used a line he has employed before and will likely use much more in the months to come. \"It's not class warfare. It's math,\" he said. His point: that if the rich aren't made to pay more, deficit reduction will come mainly from cutting spending on  programs lower and middle income Americans rely on, like entitlements and education spending. Speaker John Boehner didn't disappoint Obama. BOEHNER: \"Pitting one group of Americans against another is not leadership.\" In other words, Boehner played the class-warfare card without using the phrase. By positioning himself as the protector of lower and middle class voters and tax payers, Obama gives a Democratic Party base that has been disappointed in him, a new reason to rally behind him. He advanced that goal by warning Republicans that he would veto any effort to reduce deficits and the national debt that cut Medicare spending without raising any taxes on the rich. OBAMA: And I will veto any bill that changes benefits for those who rely on Medicare but does not raise serious revenues by asking the wealthiest Americans or biggest corporations to pay their fair share. Obama's proposals have little to no chance of being passed in their entirety. But that's not the point. Along with the jobs bill he introduced last week, the deficit-reduction plan was an opportunity to frame the political debate for the 2012 general election. If Obama has anything to say about it, whoever becomes the Republican presidential nominee, and Republican congressional candidates, will have to explain to voters why the wealthiest Americans shouldn't pay taxes at rates that are at least as high as those paid by the middle class. The president is betting he'll have the better of that argument,especially since, again, polls suggest a substantial majority of Americans agree with him. If 2012 is to be a referendum, he plans to make it not on him but on the rich and their taxes.",

            "article_content": "President Obama speaks Wednesday at North Carolina State University in Raleigh about the American Jobs Act.\n                \n                    \n                    Gerry Broome/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption President Obama speaks Wednesday at North Carolina State University in Raleigh about the American Jobs Act. For the second time in less than a week, President Obama on Wednesday visited a college campus, touting his new jobs plan. He told supporters at North Carolina  State University that if Congress goes along with his proposal for tax cuts and new government spending, it will help to restore middle-class jobs. A new CNN poll shows more Americans support the president's jobs plan than oppose it. But that survey and others also find widespread disappointment with the U.S. economy \u2014 and Obama's handling of it. At an outdoor rally in Ohio this week, cheering supporters quickly took up Obama's call for Congress to \"pass this bill.\" Just a couple of blocks away, out of earshot of the rally, it was easy to see the toll that the long economic downturn has taken here in Ohio \u2014 an important political battleground that Obama won three years ago. At a job fair sponsored by the regional logistics council, seasoned managers were putting in resumes for entry-level stock jobs. Matt Dawson lost his job as a lab technician two years ago. He's been looking for work ever since. \"We definitely need help,\" Dawson said. \"I was making $16 an hour, and I'm considering jobs at 11, 9, 10, 8 [dollars an hour]. And they're tough to come by.\" Denise Coffield has been working part-time for minimum wage since losing her job in a corporate downsizing. \"Something's got to change. I mean, the economy's not going to grow if people aren't working and they can't spend money,\" Coffield said. \"I just really hope that something changes soon.\" That deep-seated frustration is echoed in national polls, showing that most Americans feel no better off now than they did three years ago. And they doubt that Obama's economic policies are helping. It's not clear how much the president's new jobs plan will change those numbers. Alex Fischer heads the nonprofit Columbus Partnership, which is made up of some of the area's biggest businesses. \"First we have a bit of skepticism,\" Fischer said. \"I mean, this is Stimulus 2 \u2014 you can call it whatever you want to. Is that additional government spend the right strategy?\" Obama's first stimulus effort is widely seen as unsuccessful, even though many economists argue the recession would have been worse without it. Unemployment in Ohio did come down \u2014 from a high of 10.6 percent to 8.6 percent this spring. But with money from the first stimulus mostly gone now, unemployment has begun creeping up again. Belt-tightening local governments continue to shed workers here and across the country. That's why the president of the Columbus teachers union, Rhonda Johnson, was cheering Obama's plan to use new federal dollars to help keep teachers on the payroll. \"I know in Cleveland they had a layoff of more than 300 teachers,\" Johnson said. \"As a union president, the hardest thing that you have to go through is when your members lose their jobs.\" Unions played a big role in electing Obama. But labor support could be tempered next year, with so many union members out of work. When asked how enthusiastic his members are about working for the president's re-election, Mario Ciardelli of the Central Ohio Building Trades Council replied, \"That's a good question.\" \"A lot of us were a little disappointed in the recent past that he wasn't able to get things done,\" Ciardelli said. \"And we need to bring jobs back to America. It's eroded our tax base. It's eroded the American Way, the American Dream. People are just losing heart over not having employment.\" Ciardelli says the president's newfound push for the jobs act is a major step in boosting support. Passage of the bill in a divided Congress is anything but certain. Fischer of the Columbus Partnership said he wonders why Washington can't function more like his city, where Democrats and Republicans at least sometimes work together. \"We're able to push out all of this partisanship and all that goes on from that standpoint,\" Fischer said. \"And that's a big frustration in Washington. Not pointing fingers at anybody, but maybe pointing fingers at everybody.\" Polls suggest that as doubtful as Americans are about the president's economic policies, they like the Republican alternatives even less.",

Elizabeth Warren, the Harvard Law School professor who as an Obama Administration member became a hero to liberals and bane of Wall Street for championing consumer protections in financial services, will run for the U.S. Senate against Republican Sen. Scott Brown. The Boston Globe reported that a source has confirmed that Warren will make public Wednesday her decision to run: A senior campaign adviser has confirmed to the Globe that Warren will launch her candidacy by greeting voters across the state, beginning with a morning visit to a Boston MBTA station. She will then head to New Bedford, Framingham, Worcester, and Springfield, making similar appearances shaking hands and greeting voters. Warren will not make any formal statements or speeches, but her aides will put a video on her campaign website featuring the candidate talking about the major themes she will strike as a candidate. \"The pressures on middle class families are worse than ever, but it is the big corporations that get their way in Washington,\" Warren says in the video, according to a partial script given to the Globe. \"I want to change that. I will work my heart out to earn the trust of the people of Massachusetts.\" Brown won the seat in a special election after it became open with the death of  Sen. Ted Kennedy in the summer of 2009. Kennedy had occupied the seat for decades, winning it several years after his brother President John F. Kennedy won the White House in 1960. Warren has long been a vocal consumer advocate as a Harvard professor with a special interest in consumer debt issues. As part of the Obama administration, she shepherded into being her brainchild, the  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Many of President Obama's liberal supporters wanted him to nominate her to be the bureau's first leader. But resistance from Wall Street and congressional Republicans created the potential for a nasty confirmation battle with the likelihood that she wouldn't be confirmed in the end. Warren isn't a shoo-in for the Democratic nomination. Several other Democrats are also running to take on Brown. Brown's election in January 2010 was seen as a major defeat for Democrats and an omen for the electoral setbacks that would come later in the year.",

The campaign of the former senator from Pennsylvania put a brave face on what was clearly bad news. The headline on his press release read:\"Santorum Off To Solid Fundraising Start.\" His finance director, Amanda Kornegay, was quoted as saying Santorum actually did quite well, considering he didn't have his first official fundraiser until June 22. But National Journal's headline more accurately reflected the reaction of those outside the campaign: \"Rick Santorum Releases Shockingly Low 2012 Fundraising Numbers.\" It was Santorum's redefinition of a political money bomb which is clearly a lot different than a Ron Paul money bomb. Actually, it's not so shocking when you consider Santorum polling average on Real Clear Politics is 2.5 percent. And if you stripped out a June Rasmussen poll that put him at 6 percent, his average would be more like 1.6 percent. Santorum had hoped to be the favorite of social conservatives in Iowa. But Rep. Michele Bachmann from next door Minnesota has helped to ruin his plans, drawing the support of many of those voters.",

Tuesday's speech was much like many he's delivered in recent months \u2014 except this one was in Iowa, where the 2012 campaign for president is well underway.  STEVE INSKEEP, Host: It's MORNING EDITION from NPR News. I'm Steve Inskeep. RENEE MONTAGNE, Host: NPR's Scott Horsley reports. SCOTT HORSLEY: Every four years, Iowa produces a bumper crop of presidential candidates who stand on hay bales, pet prize-winning hogs, and nod with interest at the rising price of a bushel of corn. President Obama may do all of that before long. But his first visit to Iowa in this summer before the caucuses found Mr. Obama not in a field but a factory. That's no accident. Mr. Obama sees factories like the Alcoa aluminum rolling plant in Bettendorf, Iowa, as a key ingredient in America's economic revival. INSKEEP: A big part of our future has to be a robust and growing manufacturing sector. We've got to make things right here in America. (SOUNDBITE OF APPLAUSE) HORSLEY: Dave Swenson of Iowa State University says manufacturing's role in the state's economy often goes unappreciated. INSKEEP: If you ask people what's the biggest industry in Iowa, they're going to say agriculture. Many people won't even get to manufacturing by the fourth or fifth try. HORSLEY: But the total manufacturing payroll in Iowa is nearly three times that of farming, partly because factories offer some of the best paying jobs in the state. INSKEEP: They are the entree into a middle class lifestyle for a lot of Iowans that otherwise wouldn't have an opportunity for that kind of earnings. HORSLEY: Walking through the Alcoa plant yesterday with the general manager and the president of the local Steelworkers Union, Mr. Obama was impressed by the 30-ton cranes overhead and the color-coded charts tracking quality and workflow. INSKEEP: That's what made you guys competitive, having the best workers but also having the best equipment. You had to up your game. And that's what we've got to do as a country as a whole. HORSLEY: The White House said this visit was simply a chance for the president to make his case for advanced manufacturing. But one couldn't help noticing all the Republican presidential hopefuls who've also been spending time in Iowa. INSKEEP: I know you've been seeing a lot of politicians around lately. Something tells me that you may see a few more before February is over. But Iowa, you and I, we go a long way back. HORSLEY: It was at a town hall meeting three years ago that Mr. Obama first met Cynthia Ross-Friedhof. The Bettendorf restaurant owner wowed the candidate with her description of her signature dish, the Magic Mountain: loose meat, French fries, and cheddar cheese sauce piled high on Texas toast. Yesterday, Mr. Obama surprised Friedhof by stopping by Ross's 24-hour restaurant for a sample. INSKEEP: Now, I'm not sure that I'm going to be able to eat one of these, though. (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER) INSKEEP: You guys ever had one of these? U: Oh, yeah. U: Wonderful. HORSLEY: To Friedhof's delight, the president ordered half-a-dozen Mountains for himself and his staff, including two so-called Volcanoes, topped with chili and onions. MONTAGNE: I hope he brought his antacids, because he said he's going to need one after he eats a Magic Mountain, he thinks. But I don't think so. HORSLEY: Scott Horsley, NPR News.

Coming up, Medicare has been the hot issue this week. The Republican plan to overhaul Medicare failed in the Senate, giving the Democrats a new issue to campaign on in 2012. We'll talk with Mary Agnes Carey, a senior correspondent at Kaiser Health News, about the fate of Medicare and how that could affect the political landscape that's coming up. But first, a conversation with the newly elected congresswoman from Western New York who's victory Tuesday in a special election has become a flashpoint in the national debate about the future of Medicare and perhaps a potential barometer for the 2012 election cycle. Democrat Kathy Hochul began her campaign for New York's 26th congressional district as a distinct underdog but she defeated the Republican front runner by campaigning almost exclusively against the House Republican plan to overhaul Medicare. The race drew more than $2 million in political advertising from outside organizations on both sides of the aisle and Democratic leaders are hoping that Hochul's victory in a heavily Republican district signals a shift in voter attitudes back to the center. KATHY HOCHUL: I have the confidence and the faith of Republicans, Democrats, and independents who listened to our message loud and clear. We're going to protect seniors, we're going to protect the middle class and small businesses. MARTIN: That was Congresswoman-elect Kathy Hochul talking to reporters following her victory this week and she's with us now on the phone from New York. Welcome to the program. Congratulations. HOCHUL: Thank you very much for the invitation. Glad to be here. MARTIN: Do you agree with my characterization of the race that it was in fact a referendum on the Republican Medicare overhaul proposal? HOCHUL: You know, there are many factors at play but we certainly did use the Ryan budget as an opportunity to show the very clear-cut differences between the candidates, and the Ryan budget gave us an opportunity to, you know, talk about Medicare but also the other priorities in that budget such as tax breaks that continue for the very wealthiest people in this country. So we weren't afraid to really open up that budget and show people the difference, and when my opponent said had she been in Congress she would have voted for it, again, it just gave us an opportunity to say, you know what, we wouldn't have done that and here's why. So that resonated very much with people in this district and regardless of party label they embrace this message. MARTIN: Now, initially a lot of people didn't give you much of a chance in the race because Republican voters outnumbered Democrats in the district by three to one. Why did you enter the race to begin with? I mean, obviously at the beginning many people were thinking of you as a sacrificial lamb . HOCHUL: Well, I entered the race because I really knew that this district needs a representative very quickly. The seat had been vacant since February 9th, and I've never been one to shirk away from any challenge. It was an uphill battle but I also felt that, you know, I had already represented a third of the district as Erie County clerk and had done a, you know, good job for the people, working very much (unintelligible) oriented, looking out for my area, my district, and I think people knew me in part of the district but my challenge was to get better known in the much more rural outlying areas where they never heard of me before. So I knew if I could just take my message on the road, and I spent a tremendous amount of time literally pulling up to little businesses on the main streets and walking in, introducing myself, stopping in diners wherever I saw three or more cars, I really tried to have a personal touch to the race as well, because we were so outspent on television. I was running against two multi-millionaires, so I needed to break it down at the grass roots level. So a lot of people had to go out on a limb. There were many, many people who said I was the very first Democrat they ever voted for. But I think the issues, those resonate in this area (unintelligible) for the small business people, a lot of issues we had and we certainly used them. MARTIN: Let me ask you about two things. You mentioned that you'd had two, in fact, opponents in the race and both of them were wealthy individuals. One of them, a former Democrat, ran on a Tea Party line, and I'm just identifying two of the responses that Republicans have had to your win. One is that in a three way race anything can happen so this isn't dispositive of anything, that in fact the third candidate, Jack Davis, was sort of a spoiler and but for him the Republican would have won. What do you say about that? HOCHUL: Well, I think the Buffalo News Today very much clarified that and they said that was what Republicans would want to say and there was a time in the polls when Jack was taking, you know, 20, 22 percent of the vote, but when Jack Davis started losing votes, they were coming my way. They were not going to Jane Corwin as they expected. All I know is I won because I got more votes and everyone else can interpret what they will, but it's real simple to me that a lot of people put their faith in me. I take that very, very seriously and I know I'm representing, you know, a majority Republican district now. MARTIN: Hold on a second. Just to clarify for folks, there were two late polls that did indicate that the votes that were moving away from Jack Davis were moving to you. That is true. I just want to clarify that. HOCHUL: Yeah, initially the early polls showed that Jack was pulling a lot of votes from me, because he had run as a Democrat and people were - he had much higher name recognition. He had been known in this area, so - and even, you know, the Tea Party people, one day the Republicans are saying he wasn't a true Tea Partier, that he was a, you know, a pawn of the Democrats. So the Republicans are trying to have it both ways here, but the bottom line is that a lot of Republicans, independents and conservatives joined Democrats in a crossover vote for me. MARTIN: Let me just ask you one more question about that, that some of the national Republican figures like Paul Ryan in interviews after the election were saying that the reason that you won is that you, your campaign, national Democrats campaigning on your behalf, were dishonest about the proposal. They're saying that in fact their proposal to overhaul Medicare was mischaracterized and that that was at the root of your win. And I'd like to ask you to respond to that. HOCHUL: I'd be happy to respond to that. If you look at the ads that my campaign put out, the only references we made to the Ryan budget or Medicare were actual quotes from news organizations like The Wall Street Journal, like The Chicago Tribune, and other organizations. So we are very careful that it was not our words. It was the words of independent sources that were used in our television ads, so they can say what they want as far as, you know, they'd have to take on the Wall Street Journal then as far as the description that they gave... MARTIN: Okay. HOCHUL: ...of Medicare, as ending Medicare as we know it, the Ryan budget. So you know, everyone's going to have fun speculating on this, but the bottom line is I'm heading off to Washington very shortly and I will be working with both sides of the aisle. We have to roll up our sleeves, work together and get the job done, because the people in this district also don't want us to continue the fighting. MARTIN: Okay. Before we let you go, and it's not long before you'll have to start preparing for the 2012 race where you'll have to defend your seat - what are your goals for this time that you have when you come to Washington, which you will be coming soon? HOCHUL: Well, the people in this district said to me very loudly they want me to go fight for jobs. I've spent so much time talking to our small businesses, the unfairness of our tax code where businesses on Main Street are paying in more taxes than the GE's of the world. That's got to change. But also I will be the one protecting our seniors with Medicare. Let's get the underlying cost of health care under control. I do support entitlement reform and I also think we should be looking at the revenue side because the voters up here want us to work together to get our debt under control. MARTIN: Kathy Hochul won a special election Tuesday to represent New York's 26th congressional district. She replaces Republican Chris Lee, who resigned earlier this year ,and she joined us on the phone from her office. Thank you so much for joining us, Congresswoman-elect. Congratulations. HOCHUL: Thank you, my pleasure, bye-bye. Copyright \u00a9 2011 NPR.  All rights reserved.  Visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.

            "article_content": "Muslim Brotherhood spokesman Mohammed Mursi takes questions from local and international journalists at the end of a news conference Feb. 9 in Cairo.\n                \n                    \n                    Marco Longari /AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption The Muslim Brotherhood is Egypt's oldest and most organized opposition group. It also was banned under President Hosni Mubarak, who stepped down last week. What role the Brotherhood will play in the Egypt of the future worries some in the United States, Israel and other countries. They fear the group will do in Egypt what the Shiite clerics did in Iran after protesters ousted the late shah: Turn Egypt into an Islamist state and an enemy of Israel. But many in Egypt dismiss such concerns as fear-mongering. Strategic Use Of Power The Brotherhood's power was evident in the northern port city of Alexandria earlier this month. The group's leaders called on thousands of supporters to pour into the streets day after day to keep up pressure on the Mubarak regime. Egyptian security officials were worried enough to round up people with ties to the Brotherhood the week before. Among those arrested was Sobhi Saleh of Alexandria, a former lawmaker who headed a parliamentary bloc aligned with the banned movement. What Is The  Muslim Brotherhood? Founded in 1928 by Hasan  al-Banna. It  has been banned in Egypt off and on since 1948. The  Brotherhood has  branches, or has inspired political parties, in  countries including  Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Bahrain, Yemen,  Somalia, Sudan and the Gaza Strip. \"Widely considered the world's  most influential Islamist organization,\" according to the Council on Foreign  Relations. The  1960s prison writings of  member Sayyid Qutb laid the foundation for  radical Islamists, who eventually broke with the Brotherhood, including the notion that  regimes that do not rule  according to Islamic law are illegitimate and can be  attacked. Ayman al-Zawahiri, the No. 2  leader of al-Qaida, was once a member of the Muslim Brotherhood. The  Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood  has been accused of supporting Hamas and Hezbollah, but has not engaged itself  in  political violence since the 1970s. It operates social services such as day care centers,  schools, banks and hospitals. The group controls several  professional associations, including those representing engineers, doctors and  lawyers. There are divisions in the modern  Muslim Brotherhood  between those who favor political participation and those who don't. In  2005, the group won 20 percent of the parliamentary seats it contested. In  2010, just one Muslim Brotherhood candidate won as an  independent. For decades the group formed the  primary organized opposition against Egypt's President Hosni  Mubarak. Western  analysts are now debating  the extent of the group's  popularity and  the question of whether its political ascent would  lead to  Iranian-style Islamic rule. \u2014  By Alan Greenblatt Supporters freed Saleh from prison and he soon was out protesting again. Saleh calls the Brotherhood the most powerful force among the Egyptian people. But he and other leaders hasten to add that they will make no grab for power in a post-Mubarak Egypt. A Reach That's Deep, And Wide Whether those statements are true or not, the Brotherhood can't be ignored. It claims 600,000 members, and even as a banned movement, it managed to win one of every five seats in Parliament during the 2005 elections. Mubarak has used the group's sometimes violent past to justify a stifling state-of-emergency law that has been in place for 30 years. But many analysts describe the Brotherhood as a moderate Islamic political and social movement that is fiercely nationalistic and engages in philanthropy. It appeals largely to Egypt's urban professionals and the middle class. Many of the group's leaders are well-educated \u2014 physicians and pharmacists and engineers. Khaled Fahmy is chairman of the history department of the American University in Cairo. He and other Egyptians interviewed for this story believe the Brotherhood has as much right as anyone to help shape their country's future, as long as it doesn't try to take over. Brotherhood officials say they have no such plans. At a news conference last week, spokesman Mohammed Mursi said the Brotherhood will not run a presidential candidate in any upcoming elections and wants nothing more than to \"collaborate\" in creating a new Egypt. And while Brotherhood supporters joined the protests, the group took no leadership role in the uprising that swept Mubarak from power. The Power Of A Passive Approach Reached in London, Middle East analyst Fawaz Gerges says the Brotherhood's passive approach is not surprising. \"They are trying to position themselves as a centrist mainstream force as opposed to a radical and militant force,\" Gerges says, adding that the Brotherhood is also eager to avoid provoking Egypt's military government into a crackdown. \"They realize if they mobilize their followers, if they try to go unilateral,\" Gerges says, \"they might end up with the Algerian model of the 1990s, when the Islamists won an outright victory and that particular victory led to a civil war between Islamists on one hand and the Algerian army.\" That doesn't mean the Brotherhood will give up its quest for a more Islamic Egypt, says historian Khaled Fahmy. \"They are a very important player, and again, as long as they agree on the principle of equality and the principle of the rule of law, I think they should be included in the political discussion of the future of Egypt,\" Fahmy says. But blogger Gigi Ibrahim, who is part of the youth movement that helped bring down Mubarak, is more skeptical. \"They have been created to scare us from democracy,\" Ibrahim says. \"And now that we have democracy, it will be interesting [to see] who they really are.\"",

Around Iraq, TVs in offices, cafes and homes are tuned to live feeds of the protests in Egypt. It seems like all of Iraq is talking about what it might look like if another longtime Arab dictator falls. Yet, as with a lot of things in Iraq, the reaction to the uprising in Egypt depends on whom you ask. In a Shiite neighborhood, amid the battery of checkpoints, one policeman says he figures he ought to be more polite now, because people might take to the streets and try to get the police fired. And that sentiment goes beyond the checkpoints. In local newspapers, one official warned of problems like a coming \"unemployment volcano\" and said the people could erupt at any time. Others pointed fingers at their rivals, blaming them for lack of services. Still others were quick to make promises to take better care of common people. Reminders Of Iraq's Past In the middle-class, mostly Shiite neighborhood of Karada, Iraqi guys sitting around and smoking sheesha say they're excited about what's happening in Egypt. They say they're glad Iraqis aren't the only ones who looted in the midst of chaos. Now, they say, maybe Egyptians won't be so quick to judge. Iraqi protesters carry defaced posters of Egyptian  President Hosni Mubarak in Baghdad. A few dozen activists  gathered Sunday to show solidarity with Egyptians  calling for Mubarak's departure.\n                \n                    \n                    Hadi Mizban/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Iraqi protesters carry defaced posters of Egyptian  President Hosni Mubarak in Baghdad. A few dozen activists  gathered Sunday to show solidarity with Egyptians  calling for Mubarak's departure. \"They were criticizing us, accusing us of being Ali Baba, which means thieves,\" says Alaa Abdulkarim. \"But now they are doing the same thing.\" Down the street, some older, perhaps wiser, men are playing dominoes. When asked about Egypt, journalist and writer Sabah Hassan recites some Arabic poetry: \"If the people want life, then destiny should respond.\" But, he says, it's bittersweet to watch the Egyptian people rise up against a dictator. The Iraqi people did the same, he says, 20 years ago. This was after the first Gulf War, when protests swept the south and north of Iraq. \"Iraqi people did fight Saddam [Hussein],\" he says. But \"there was no media to cover everything, there was no media to talk about it \u2014 just like no one knew what was happening in Iraq.\" No live feeds on Al-Jazeera. Eventually, the uprising was suppressed. It was 12 more years before the dictator fell. Change From Within Across town is the mostly Sunni neighborhood of Mansour \u2014 where people were much more likely to be loyal to Saddam, and much more wary of the idea of regime change. At a street stall, they are cooking hamburgers Iraqi-style, meaning that the meat is lamb and the french fries go inside the bun. Owner Jassim al Hilli says it's galling to watch the Egyptian people do the job of toppling the strongman, when in Iraq it took an occupying force to bring him down. \"For most of the Arabic countries \u2014 actually all the Arabic countries \u2014 they like freedom and they like to do it by themselves,\" he says. \"It's not like someone else would come and do it for you.\" 'We Have Elections' Ibrahim Sumydai, an Iraqi political analyst, agrees that many Iraqis are still angry that they weren't the ones to topple Saddam. But he says he doubts the spirit of mass protest will spread here. At least not right now. First, he says, Iraqi society is still divided. If Shiite leaders were to lead mass protests, Sunnis would probably sit out \u2014 and vice versa. That said, there are things that unite Iraqis: anger at a continuing lack of electricity, which brought both Sunnis and Shiites to the streets last summer; unemployment despite rising oil revenues; and the ongoing lack of security. \"I think maybe we will face increasing calling for good services. But all the Iraqi people feel they are guilty because they brought [these] politicians in power,\" he says. And they can take them out of power, if they want. This, he says, is a privilege the Iraqis have now, a privilege the Egyptians want. \"We have elections. We have free elections.\" Right now, Sumydai says, Iraqis should focus on rebuilding the country, not breaking it down. Like those of many others, his message to Egypt was simple: Be careful what you wish for. Ghassan Adnan contributed to this report",

            "article_content": "Protests continue in Tunisia after the president was forced to flee the country. NPR's Eric Westervelt travels outside the capital, Tunis, to measure the effects of protests outside the city and sends this report.  LIANE HANSEN, host: In Tunisia, street protests continue this weekend against the interim government. Many protestors complain the new leadership still has too many allies of outed dictator Ben Ali. The transitional government has promised to hold new elections as soon as possible. But many in the North African country are insisting on a clean break with the old regime. NPR's Eric Westervelt reports from the rural town where the revolt started. ERIC WESTERVELT: The massive street protest that included scores from urban Tunis's educated middle-classes, played a key role in driving autocrat Ben Ali from power. (Soundbite of chanting protestors) WESTERVELT: But the revolution began on this dusty main street of Sidi Bouzid, four hours south of the capital. (Soundbite of chanting protestors) WESTERVELT: On Saturday, a crowd of young people again marched up what until a few days ago was named in honor of Ben Ali. It's been renamed Mohamed Bouazizi Avenue, after the 26-year-old street vendor who set himself on fire in mid-December in front of the local government building here. His family say Bouazizi acted after repeatedly being harassed, humiliated and shaken down by a local female inspector and local police. Nearby, large pictures of Bouazizi wearing a slight grin declare him the first light of the revolution. Twenty-seven-year-old school teacher Amin Bayawi(ph) turned out to protest the first day, and he continues to take to the streets. He says Bouazizi's act quickly symbolized the frustration of all impoverished Tunisians, fed up with rampant corruption, repression and economic stagnation - issues that have hit the opportunity-starved Tunisian interior particularly hard. Bayawi says, here where it all began, theyll keep the pressure on the interim government to bring about real and lasting change. (Soundbite of protestors) Mr. AMIN BAYAWI: The international challenge are making the protest worldwide. All the people speak about the Tunisian revolution. And we dont like to lose this opportunity of democracy. We are going to fight for this revolution to the end. WESTERVELT: Others are not just worried about the makeup of the interim government. There's fear the army made a quiet coup. The military is in firm control of security. Its tanks and heavy weapons protect all key facilities across the country. Forty-four-year-old education consultant, Mohaiba Shakir(ph) sees troubling signs, like cryptic announcements on state TV that ex-security chiefs and members of the former dictator's family have been arrested. But there are no details. The army and provisional government, Shakir says, need to show much more transparency about whats really going on. Ms. MOHAIBA SHAKIR (Education Consultant): To show the people that they are really working for the people. For example, they say that they arrested more than 30 people but we cannot see them on TV. Why not? WESTERVELT: And the once omnipresent Mukhabarat, the secret police, where have they all gone, she asks? Adding, there are still many questions we want answered.

Rick Perry wait for the  results of Florida's straw  poll to be announced at the Florida President 5 convention on Sept. 24, 2011 in Orlando, Florida.  Candidate Herman Cain won the straw poll with 37.11% of the vote. Read Another Opinion On Rick Perry's Campaign Timothy Noah is a senior editor of The New Republic. \"It's not who is the slickest candidate or the smoothest debater that we need to elect,\" Rick Perry said today at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Orlando. \"We need to elect the candidate with the best record, and the best vision for this country. The current occupant of the White House can sure talk a good game, but he doesn't deliver. Matter of fact, remember President Clinton? Man, he could sell ice cubes to Eskimos. And the next day be against ice cubes! The alternative is candidates who stick to principle, stand their ground, because they believe in something.\" So ... being a good debater means you're ineffectual at best, inauthentic or downright dishonest at worst. Coherence equals glibness. If I were stuck with Perry's particular skill set that's probably what I'd be saying too. But by playing up the idea that strong, silent cowpokes like himself \"stick to principle, stand their ground,\" Perry makes it harder to back away from extremist political positions such as his stated belief that Social Security, Medicare, and the direct election of senators are all unconstitutional. Perry's opponent, Mitt Romney, has no intention of letting debate audiences forget about this. How will Perry handle it? We got a glimpse of his strategy in an August interview with the Daily Beast's Andrew Romano: \"Q: The Constitution says that 'the Congress shall have Power To lay and collect Taxes... to provide for the... general Welfare of the United States.' But I noticed that when you quoted this section on page 116 [of Perry's book, Fed Up!], you left 'general welfare' out and put an ellipsis in its place. Progressives would say that 'general welfare' includes things like Social Security or Medicare\u2014that it gives the government the flexibility to tackle more than just the basic responsibilities laid out explicitly in our founding document.  What does 'general welfare' mean to you? \"A: I don't think our founding fathers when they were putting the term 'general welfare' in there were thinking about a federally operated program of pensions nor a federally operated program of health care. What they clearly said was that those were issues that the states need to address. Not the federal government. I stand very clear on that. From my perspective, the states could substantially better operate those programs if that's what those states decided to do. \"Q: So in your view those things fall outside of general welfare. But what falls inside of it? What did the Founders mean by 'general welfare'? \"A: I don't know if I'm going to sit here and parse down to what the Founding Fathers thought general welfare meant. \"Q: But you just said what you thought they didn't mean by general welfare. So isn't it fair to ask what they did mean? It's in the Constitution. \"A: [Silence.] \"Q: OK. Moving on.... \"",

Just how powerful is  Medicare as a political weapon? So powerful that for the past two election  cycles it's been a favorite cudgel for both Republicans and  Democrats. And the election of  Democrat Kathy Hochul to fill a traditionally GOP seat in upstate New York in May is just  the latest demonstration. Hochul and the  national Democratic Party ran a campaign based on large part on the House  Republican Budget passed in April that essentially would privatize the government  program for the elderly and disabled. And their campaign  worked. Harvard political scientist and pollster Robert Blendon isn't surprised. \"Older Americans tend to  vote at much higher rates than other voters,\" he says. At the same time, he  adds, \"they are the group that most care about health care as a voting  issue.\" Influential Ads It was Republicans,  however, who got the better of the Medicare issue last year. That's when, of  all the hundreds of provisions in the massive health care overhaul law, they  zeroed in on the fact that it would reduce Medicare spending by a half-trillion  dollars over 10 years. \"Grayson and Kosmas \u2014  they betrayed the trust of Florida's seniors,\" proclaimed one ad that the  conservative senior group 60 Plus ran targeting central Florida Democrats Alan  Grayson and Suzanne Kosmas, both of whom voted for the health bill. \"And this  November, we'll remember,\" seniors say at the end of the  spot. Ads like that helped  Republicans sweep Grayson, Kosmas and dozens of their Democratic colleagues out  of office and the GOP into the House majority. Now Democrats are  ready to turn the tables, also using Medicare as their weapon. They're taking  aim at the budget plan every House Republican voted for in April. That plan's  major Medicare changes wouldn't affect current seniors, but you wouldn't know  that to listen to Democrats and their advocates. One of the most  controversial ads, from a liberal group called the Agenda Project, shows an  actor dressed to resemble House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, literally  pushing a little old lady out of a wheelchair and over a cliff, while \"America the Beautiful\" plays in the background. Another, from a group  called Protect Your Care, features a senior named Julie who says, \"You're  looking for cuts. Why are you looking at us?\" 'Sick Of The Political Demagoguery' Despite the backlash,  however, Ryan is not apologizing for the Medicare plan he put  forward. \"I would do it just  like this if I had to do it all over again,\" he said in an interview at NPR  recently. And Ryan says he's  convinced that his plan to privatize Medicare won't pay off for Democrats come  election day 2012. \"I really believe people are ready for these kinds of  solutions; they want to see leaders tackle these challenges,\" he said. \"And they  are sick of the political demagoguery, and I think people are becoming more  desensitized to all these attack things.\" That's not how House  Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi sees it, of course. \"Medicare for us is a  pillar of health and economic security for our seniors,\" said Pelosi, who also  sat down for an interview at NPR recently. \"It's an ethic. it's a value ... and we  intend to fight for it. Pelosi is quick to  point out that she understands there is a problem with Medicare. She  acknowledges that Medicare is not financially sound enough to sustain the  retirement of 78 million baby boomers who are beginning to join the program this  year, and that Medicare costs are a major drag on the nation's debt and deficit  problem. She also says using  Medicare as a weapon is not her first choice. \"Would you rather have success  with the issue, or would you rather have a fight in the election? Of course you'd  rather have success,\" she said. \"That's what you came here to do. That's what's  important to the well-being of the American people.\" Reining In Spending Again? Still, there's another  reason Medicare is such a potent political weapon, particularly for seniors,  says Chris Jennings, who advised President Bill Clinton on health policy. When  it comes to elections, fear beats hope. \"So fear of losing  something is far more salient an issue than hope of something to be improved  upon,\" he says. But Jennings adds that there may  be light at the end of the tunnel. A Democratic president and a Republican Congress  did manage to rein in Medicare spending and balance the federal budget in the  1990s \u2014 though only after huge fights in the years immediately leading up to  that. And those fights, he says,  looked an awful lot like the ones taking place  right now. \"At the end of the  day, though, the pendulum swung back and forth until it got to the middle in  1997, where both sides concluded it was in both interests to step back and to  negotiate an agreement,\" Jennings  remembers. If history repeats  itself, that could happen again \u2014 in the year  2013.",

You don't get to be chairman of a major congressional committee like the House Budget Committee if you're the type to shrink from a challenge and Rep. Paul Ryan certainly doesn't appear to be that. His current challenge, of course, is a daunting one, to convince fellow Republicans that his plan to privatize Medicare won't be as toxic to their 2012 electoral hopes as Democrats gleefully insist it will be, especially if they have anything to say about it. The Republican loss of a New York congressional seat long held by the GOP in a special election in which Ryan's Medicare proposal became an issue, makes Ryan's task more difficult. But in a meeting with NPR journalists Thursday, Ryan indicated that timing was everything. Essentially, while what he called Democratic \"Mediscare\" tactics might work short term, there was enough time between now and Election Day, 18 months, for Republicans to ultimately win the message war. Here's the key. I don't think it works. Mediscare can work in a short time frame, in a compressed time-table if demagoguery can get out there fast. But truth does prevail at the end of the day. Facts are facts. And with 18 months out there, I believe the facts are going to get out there. He could be right. A year and a half gives Republicans plenty of time to road test different messages and land on one or two that play best with those all-important independent voters. But Democrats won't exactly be sitting still either as they try to perfect their messages also. Republicans also are at something at a disadvantage if the question comes down to, as it will, which party will best protect entitlements. Unlike Democrats, Republicans have never been confused with being the party of entitlements. So Democrats start with a natural advantage on the question. Republicans like Ryan will argue they want to save Social Security by using the free market to create more competition that could reduce health care inflation, which is what Ryan said Thursday at NPR. Democrats will tell voters that Republicans want to privatize Medicare by forcing future seniors into the not-so-tender mercies of private health-insurance market its confusing complexities. Maybe after 18 months of this partisan back and forth, voters will see things Ryan's way and come to trust Republicans more than Democrats on entitlements. But that seems like a big maybe at this point.",

Hochul won the traditionally Republican 26th District Congressional seat with 48 percent of the vote.\n                \n                    \n                    David Duprey/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Democrat Kathy Hochul speaks during a news conference in Clarence, N.Y. on May 9. Hochul won the traditionally Republican 26th District Congressional seat with 48 percent of the vote. Jerry Zremski is the Washington bureau chief of The Buffalo News. Democrat Kathy Hochul bounded to the stage of a union hall in Amherst, just northeast of Buffalo, late Tuesday as the newly elected congresswoman from the ruby red congressional district that brought us Jack Kemp, Bill Paxon and Tom Reynolds. After all the requisite hugs and thank yous, she mentioned her plans to fight to close corporate tax loopholes and make millionaires pay their fair share. \"We can do all that,\" she said, \"and not decimate Medicare.\" Hearing that single word, the crowd erupted with the mantra of the Hochul campaign. \"Medicare! Medicare! Medicare!\" The Hochul message \u2014 the one that was a winner for her \u2014 could be seen on signs all around New York's Twenty-Sixth District, from the sprawling strip malls of Buffalo's wealthiest suburbs to the faded farms of Genesee County to the lawns of neat old houses to the west of Rochester. \"Save Medicare/Vote Hochul,\" the signs said. Six and a half months after Republicans regained the House and three months after the seat's most recent occupant, Republican Chris Lee, resigned after flexing his biceps for the wrong other woman on Craigslist, Hochul showed congressional Democrats that they have some reason for hope in 2012. The Democrats won because they had the right message and the right candidate and the blessing of weak opposition. Hochul won by 48 percent to 42 percent over Republican Jane Corwin, a self-funded millionairess delivering an austere 2010 message a few months too late. \"Tea Party\" candidate Jack Davis drew 9 percent of the vote, but, given that two late polls showed voters abandoning Davis for Hochul, it's fair to assume that Hochul would have won regardless of whether Davis, a former Democrat, had run. Hochul started talking about preserving Medicare as a government-guaranteed benefit in ads and on the trail beginning April 15, a date that could become to House Republicans what the Ides of March was to Caesar. That's the day the House passed Representative Paul Ryan's budget blueprint, replete with its plan to replace Medicare with a private voucher system for anyone younger than 55. That very day, Corwin said she would have voted for the Ryan budget. And. a few days later, the Hochul campaign responded with a tough ad warning that the GOP budget plan would \"essentially end Medicare\" and cost the average senior an extra $6,400. The ad was misleading. While the Ryan budget plan would raise the cost of care for those now under 55, it would not end Medicare for today's retirees. But the message, which Hochul repeated incessantly on the campaign trail, resonated in a district where 22 percent of voters are over age 65. By the end of April, a Siena Research Institute poll found residents of the district opposing Medicare and Social Security cuts by a 59 percent to 38 percent margin. The poll also showed Hochul only five points behind Corwin in a race that, until that point, looked to New York political pros like a Corwin landslide in the making. Inexplicably, Corwin, a businesswoman-turned-state assemblywoman, found herself utterly flat-footed in trying to respond on the Medicare issue. Asked by The Buffalo News in early May about Congressional Budget Office figures showing that the Ryan plan could cost future seniors upwards of $7.000 a year more for health care, she replied, \"To be honest, I don't have figures on that.\" As Hochul's campaign began to hit home, Corwin started inching away from the Ryan plan, calling it a great start but saying she would consider other alternatives to fixing Medicare. When Corwin finally came up with a full-throated response to Hochul's Medicare argument about a week before Election Day, it was a full-throated lie.            \"The truth is it's Hochul who says she would cut Social Security and Medicare,\" the ad  says \u2014 a claim that FactCheck.org quickly labeled \"bogus.\" Conjured up out of a comment Hochul made about entitlements being \"on the table\" in budget talks, the ad resulted in devastating fact-checks in The Buffalo News and on Buffalo's top-rated television station. Corwin was unprepared in more ways than one. Privately, in retrospect, Republicans wonder if this well-dressed, Range Rover-driving businesswoman was the right fit in a district where the wealthy are concentrated in the Buffalo-area subdivisions near where Corwin lives. Both GOP consultants and voters complained about her designer handbags and aloof demeanor, which didn't play so well with dairy farmers suffering the ups and downs of milk prices and blue-collar Republicans in the small towns that dot the district. Corwin also botched her response to Davis's \"Tea Party\" candidacy. Davis, an anti-trade zealot and serial congressional candidate who ran three times as a Democrat, never was a serious threat to win, but he always was a serious threat to steal votes from Corwin. Yet the Corwin campaign didn't bombard Davis with negative ads until late in the game \u2014 so late, in fact, that the ads appeared to do collateral damage to Corwin, whose negatives rose to near 50 percent in two polls as her harshly negative ad campaign wore on. Most inexplicably of all, the Corwin camp tried to stage a get-off-my-lawn fracas with the irascible Davis. On May 11, Corwin's legislative chief of staff, video camera in hand, approached Davis after an event and demanded to know why the old man had refused to debate. Davis, predictably, lunged at the camera, prompting the Corwin staffer to squeal and the Erie County Republican Committee to release a bizarre video that raised more questions than it answered. WNYMedia.net quickly revealed that the videographer was on Corwin's Assembly staff, prompting a media uproar that featured plenty of footage of Corwin rushing past reporters and refusing to discuss the incident. In a district with nearly 30,000 more Republicans than Democrats, it's possible a GOP candidate could survive such embarrassments \u2014 especially with the help of about $3 million in campaign cash plus at least another $1 million from the likes of the National Republican Congressional Committee and American Crossroads, Karl Rove's SuperPAC. But all that money seemed to matter little in a race where the Democrats countered with a couple million of their own \u2014 and with an especially focused and articulate candidate. From the Ryan budget vote onward, Hochul, the Erie County clerk, honed her campaign message around Medicare, and drove it home in interviews and visits to diners and farmer's markets in every corner of the district. Forever beaming a broad Irish smile and peppering her flat and folksy speech with \"I'll tell ya\" and references to the Buffalo Bills, Hochul struck voters as someone they could trust. \"I like her,\" said Regina Golanka, 73, of the small industrial city of North   Tonawanda said after meeting Hochul. \"She's got more personality than that other one. She's straightforward.\" Hochul is also just the sort of Democrat that won toss-up House seats in 2008 and 2010. She's for raising taxes on the very wealthy \u2014 but not on people who make less than $500,000, a considerably higher threshold than most Democrats would set. She talks about going to Washington to make life easier for small business, and she goes there with a record of breaking with Democratic governors on issues like driver's licenses for illegal immigrants. She insisted, too, that her campaign was strictly a local affair of national significance. \"My message is clear: That the voters of this district sent me to Washington because I said I would fight for them on Medicare, make sure the lobbyist pay their share, and get our budget under control,\" she told reporters shortly after her victory speech. \"I'm going to fight for the residents of the Twenty-Sixth District. So whatever happens nationally, I'm very focused on my new district.\" But Democrats around the country know better. Hochul's victory spells trouble for the Republicans and hope for the Democrats in the November 2012 elections.",

Xavier Becerra (D-CA, left) and Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), speaks at an April news conference on Capitol Hill. Pelosi says the Republicans' Medicare plan is a political boon to her party.\n                \n                    \n                    Alex Wong/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), shown with Reps. Xavier Becerra (D-CA, left) and Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), speaks at an April news conference on Capitol Hill. Pelosi says the Republicans' Medicare plan is a political boon to her party. One thing Republicans and Democrats have learned in recent years is how to use Medicare to attack the other party. Republicans say Democrats will ruin the program by letting it go bankrupt, while Democrats say the GOP wants to abolish the program altogether. It's hard for voters to sort out who's telling the truth, and even harder to tell which party will have an advantage on the issue in 2012. Next week, we'll have the results of a political test case \u2014 a three-way congressional election in New York, where Medicare has become a central issue. The focus is on the Republican plan to replace Medicare in the future with vouchers for beneficiaries to buy private insurance. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) says that plan is a political boon to her party. \"It has served us well politically because of a race in upstate New York,\" she says, \"a race we should not have had any prospects in \u2014 but Medicare has changed that whole race.\" An Unexpectedly Competitive Race New York's 26th Congressional District is one of the 10 most heavily Republican districts in the country. But the race has become competitive since Democrats began using Medicare to hammer Republican Jane Corwin and the independent, Jack Davis, who claims to be the Tea Party candidate. \"You've earned it, worked your whole life for it,\" says the Democratic ad supporting candidate Kathy Hochul. \"Unfortunately, Jack Davis said Social Security benefits may have to be adjusted down. Worse, Jane Corwin supports a budget that essentially ends Medicare.\" Republicans are firing right back with their own ad, which, just as in 2010, accuses Democrats of cutting Medicare: \"Kathy Hochul \u2014 a false campaign about Jane Corwin's position on Medicare, when the truth is, it's Hochul who says she would cut Medicare and Social Security.\" The prize here is the votes of those who are retired or soon to retire. In 2010, voters older than 60 were one-third of the electorate, and Republicans won their biggest share of them since the Reagan years. That's a big reason why Democrats lost the House. Now, Pelosi is determined to get those seniors back \u2014 and with them the House majority. \"We won the House of Representatives in 2006 because in 2005, President Bush thought it was a good idea to privatize \u2014 or partially privatize \u2014 Social Security. [That was] deadly, politically,\" Pelosi says. \"This is what is in our DNA as Democrats, and the same thing with Medicare. So if they want to mess with Medicare, we're here for the fight.\" Pelosi says she and President Obama are open to making some changes to keep Medicare solvent, but are opposed to anything that would alter the basic structure of the program. A Change In The Political Dynamics Still, the politics of Medicare aren't as simple as in the past, says Bob Blendon of Harvard University, who tracks public opinion on health care. \"The thing that has changed the political dynamic is that though people oppose the cuts for Medicare, they're very anxious to see something done about the budget deficit now and the national debt,\" Blendon says. That's why Republican Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, the author of the controversial Medicare plan, says he is heartened by polls showing Republicans have an edge with voters concerned about the debt. \"My town halls were phenomenally, overwhelmingly supportive; they were 80/20 crowds,\" Ryan said recently. \"Clearly, an issue like this is going to be controversial, but the vast majority of crowds that members experienced were overwhelmingly positive.\" Every House Republican but four voted for Ryan's Medicare plan. But in the Senate, Republicans have no plans to take it up. The Republican presidential hopefuls have been lukewarm, and one \u2014 former House Speaker Newt Gingrich \u2014 said on Meet the Press that he opposes the Ryan plan because it was \"too big a jump.\" \"I don't think imposing radical change from the right or the left is a very good way for a free society to operate,\" Gingrich said. \"I think we need a national conversation to get to a better Medicare system with more choices for seniors.\" There's a reason for the split among Republicans, Blendon says. \"If you are running for president, I don't think that you want to find yourself in a position that could be unpopular among people who have been voting Republican in repeated elections.\" But he says Republican House members may have a different set of political calculations. \"If I'm somebody who won a really aggressive primary in a Tea Party-type conservative fiscal point of view,\" Blendon says, \"I could be challenged if I don't do something right now about this budget deficit.\" But doing something about the deficit means doing something about its biggest driver, Medicare, which is still political quicksand. That's why it's unlikely any big progress on the deficit will be made before the next election.",

If a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step, agreements to raise the federal debt ceiling and on deficit reduction start with a Thursday White House meeting, the first of likely many between Vice President Biden and a bipartisan group of lawmakers. Most immediately, the White House and lawmakers need to agree on raising the debt limit so the nation doesn't default for the first time in its history on its financial obligations. Congressional Republicans have insisted for weeks that any vote to increase that ceiling be tied to real reductions in federal spending with some GOP lawmakers saying they would refuse to vote for a ceiling increase without a guarantee of budget cuts. The Wall Street Journal reports that one way policymakers see of getting to yes, at least on raising the debt ceiling, is for the Obama White House and congressional Republicans to agree to defer controversial ideas for deficit reduction, such as profound changes to entitlement programs like Medicare, until after the 2012 general election. An excerpt: GOP leaders and the White House are discussing a deal that would enact strict deficit targets and some spending cuts to win Republican votes for lifting the ceiling on how much the federal government can borrow. The deal would defer contentious decisions about Medicare, Medicaid and taxes until after the 2012 elections. If such an agreement were reached, it would allow both sides to assure financial markets and the public of their commitment to reducing the deficit and then use next year's campaign to lay out their competing visions for the future of major government programs. Along those lines of deferring the big stuff until voters have a chance to give one party or the other a clearer mandate, the Washington Post reports that House Republicans will offer other ideas where significant savings might be had: On the eve of debt-reduction talks led by Vice President Biden, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (Va.) said Republicans remain convinced that reining in federal retirement programs is the key to stabilizing the nation's finances over the long term. But he said Republicans recognize they may need to look elsewhere to achieve consensus after President Obama \"excoriated us\" for a proposal to privatize Medicare. That search could start, Cantor said, with a list of GOP proposals that would save $715 billion over the next decade by ending payments to wealthy farmers, limiting lawsuits against doctors, and expanding government auctions of broadcast spectrum to telecommunications companies, among other items. Democrats said they were encouraged by the move, which could smooth the way to a compromise allowing Congress to raise the legal limit on government borrowing and avoid a national default. Meanwhile, other reporting indicates that not only do Democrats and Republicans need to find common ground, Senate Democrats apparently need to find reach agreement with each other, too. But apparently, Senate Democrats can't even find agreement among themselves on what approach to pursue. Roll Call reports that Senate Democrats won't have a specific, deficit-reduction proposal of their own to present at the talks, in part because of their failure to decide on a single approach. An excerpt: But even if Reid wanted to put a specific proposal on the table, his caucus is deeply divided over what to do, with perhaps a half-dozen approaches under consideration. Plus, the Majority Leader has already watched three in his caucus sign on to a Republican-backed spending cap, and he will have to contend with liberals worried about proposals that include deep spending cuts to their favorite programs. \"It's a mess,\" another Democratic aide said. Sen. Patty Murray acknowledged that Democrats don't yet have a plan. \"I think there is the fact that we need to come to consensus, but on what it is yet, we're not there,\" the Washington state Democrat said.",

RENEE MONTAGNE, Host: NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley has been listening with us to the budget director, Jack Lew. W: Is it politically impossible for the White House to touch entitlements right now? SCOTT HORSLEY: Well, not impossible, Renee, but it is politically risky. You hear Jack Lew talking about that experience in the 1980s that he was involved in, and the administration points to that experience both as a hopeful sign that Democrats and Republicans can work together on a problem like this, as Lew's former boss Tip O'Neill worked with then President Reagan. But they also see it as a cautionary tale of what happens when a president tries to act too soon on his own before the proper groundwork's been laid. Ronald Reagan tried that in 1981. He wound up beating a hasty retreat when his own Social Security plan was attacked, and President Obama does not want to repeat that experience. MONTAGNE: And it's a good time to point out, then, that in the last election, Republicans brutalized Democrats for adjusting Medicare, and Democrats brutalized Republicans for talking about changes to Social Security - just talking about changes. HORSLEY: We should say, too, that, you know, Social Security, of all the long-term challenges that the government faces, that's the easiest one to fix. Very modest adjustments to taxes, very modest adjustments to benefits could solve that problem. Health care's the much tougher nut to crack. MONTAGNE: Well, just a - almost a yes or no answer: In the budget, are cuts to discretionary programs, are those cuts popular? HORSLEY: Well, Renee, we're still seeing resistance to the cut in heating assistance for low-income families. The challenge on all these cuts is that Americans tend want more government than we're willing to pay for. MONTAGNE: Thanks very much. That's NPR's Scott Horsley.

Santorum  has little running room outside of Iowa and, Modglin said, \"I don't want to waste  my vote.\" Bob Baldes, 67, is a retired school administrator from Davenport. \"There are some negatives about some other candidates, but I'm most hopeful that Romney has experience with the economy and experience and personality to work with the other side. We desperately need someone to do that,\" said Baldes. He says that some are \"concerned about\" Romney's Mormon religion, but \"that is absolutely no factor for me.\"",

            "article_content": "The fact-checking movement has been gaining momentum and gaining fans. Journalistic fact checkers serve as referees by calling foul \u2014 and fair \u2014 on various assertions by politicians, public figures and pundits with heavily documented analyses. But a slow-burn backlash flared into the open this past week. Much of it centered on Bill Adair, the editor-in-chief of the Pulitzer Prize-winning PolitiFact project from the St. Petersburg Times. \"We have disrupted the protocol in a lot of ways. We have come in and said we're not just going to pass along what the politicians are saying anymore,\" he says. \"We're going to fact-check them, and we're going to go even further and we're going to rate them.\" PolitiFact does so with ratings on a \"Truth-O-Meter\" ranging from \"True\" to \"Pants on Fire.\" \"That has shaken the establishment,\" Adair says. \"I think people are not accustomed to the press doing this, and I think that's a reflection that the press has ... fallen down on the job. This is what we should have been doing all along.\" According to PolitiFact, videos like this one used elderly actors to falsely suggest Rep. Paul Ryan's Medicare plan would adversely affect current senior citizens. PolitiFact has partnered with many other news organizations in rendering its opinions, including NPR. On Tuesday, Adair announced the group's \"Lie of the Year\": a claim by some Democrats and liberals about a House Republican plan to change Medicare. One version of the claim came from U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius: \"Instead of improving Medicare, they would end Medicare as we know it.\" Liberals reacted in anger against PolitiFact, including writers from Talking Points Memo and Slate, as well as New York Times columnist Paul Krugman, who wrote a blog post titled \"Politifact, R.I.P.\" MSNBC's Rachel Maddow also criticized the announcement Tuesday night. \"The self-proclaimed but quickly-becoming-irrelevant website PolitiFact declared the idea that Republicans voted to end Medicare their 'Lie of the Year' for 2011,\" she said. She argued PolitiFact had its own facts wrong. \"But make no mistake \u2014 what the Republicans have proposed is actually ending Medicare,\" Maddow said. The plan, pushed by the Republican chairman of the House Budget Committee, Paul Ryan, would shift Medicare from a health care entitlement program for all seniors to a health care subsidy with a sliding scale to support lower-income retirees. Everyone now under 55 would receive vouchers once he or she reached retirement age to subsidize the purchase of private medical insurance. The value of those vouchers would diminish over time, thus saving the government money on expanding health care costs. \"So whether that ends Medicare or essentially ends Medicare or ends Medicare as we know it seems a matter of judgment and interpretation and semantics,\" says Alec MacGillis, senior editor at the liberal New Republic. MacGillis says the fact checkers can serve a purpose, but in this case he argues Adair and PolitiFact have damaged their cause. \"To declare it the 'Lie of the Year' seemed to be going a bit far,\" he says. It should be noted that PolitiFact was not alone among its peers in its assessment of Democrats' claims about the Medicare plan. The Washington Post's Glenn Kessler and Factcheck.org also pointed to it as one of the most misleading claims of the year. But among PolitiFact's skeptics, count Ramesh Ponnuru, a senior editor for the conservative National Review. \"A fairly large proportion of the time, they're not actually calling out factual inaccuracies \u2014 they are suggesting that their interpretation of facts is superior to the one that a politician is offering,\" he says. Ponnuru says he thinks the Democrats' claims about the change in Medicare are legitimate and says the end result of fact-checking efforts like PolitiFact is to shut down intense political discourse. \"I mean, it's just part of democratic politics that has to be endured,\" he says. This week, a cover story in the conservative Weekly Standard argues the fact-checking movement is just one more way journalists apply a veneer of objectivity to their liberal outlook. PolitiFact's past two \"Lies of the Year\" have singled out conservatives and Republicans. Liberal critics argue this year's result is an attempt to balance the scales. \"It's a very difficult question to say whether that's the end of  Medicare or whether that is a significant transformation or whether that's a tinkering  with it or whatever,\" says John McQuaid, a columnist for Forbes.com and past Pulitzer-winning reporter for the New Orleans Times-Picayune. \"It's really a question that has to be answered by the political process itself.\" Adair says the American electorate needs fact checkers to give voters enough information to make up their own minds. \"We're going to make the best calls we can in a pretty gutsy form of journalism,\" he says. \"When we do, I think it's natural that the people on one side or other of this very partisan world we live in are going to be unhappy.\" Such wide-ranging criticism, he says, is the cost of the responsibility they have taken on.",

Ron Wyden, a Democrat, (left) and House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican, present their plan for changing Medicare at the U.S. Capitol Thursday. There's not much that's new in the Medicare proposal just unveiled by Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (R-Wisc.) So why is it getting so much attention? One word. No, not plastics. Politics! Sure, the proposal is quite a bit different from the controversial plan authored by Ryan and passed by the House in April that would essentially turn Medicare into a voucher program. The latest one, like Ryan's original, would include a cap on total Medicare spending and feature more private competition than under the current program, though. But Wyden, at a briefing at held by the Bipartisan Policy Center, said he was careful in negotiating with Ryan to ensure that the current proposal, which would not be introduced in legislative form until after the 2012 election, preserves the things progressive Democrats value most in Medicare. \"The first of course, was to make sure traditional Medicare, with its marketplace clout, popularity among seniors, low administrative costs, was preserved for all time,\" he said. At the same time, he said, the compromise with Ryan represents a \"more reasonable approach\" to limiting growth, and making sure that if costs did grow they wouldn't \"automatically hammer the seniors.\" Wyden's fellow Democrats aren't sure he's doing them such a big favor. They think he's more likely letting Ryan and his fellow Republicans off the hook just as Dems are using Medicare as a club on the campaign trail. \"We are concerned that Wyden-Ryan,  like Congressman Ryan's earlier proposal, would undermine, rather than  strengthen, Medicare,\" said a statement from White House Communications Director  Dan Pfeiffer. \"The Wyden-Ryan scheme could, over time, cause the traditional  Medicare program to 'wither on the vine' because it would raise premiums,  forcing many seniors to leave traditional Medicare and joint private  plans.\" Rep. Pete Stark (D-Calif.), the longtime chairman and now ranking Democrat on the House Ways and Means health subcommittee said the measure still does \"end Medicare as we know it, plain and simple.\" Said Stark, \"if these two get their way, senior citizens' health coverage will depend on what big insurance offers and what seniors \u2014 most of them on modest, fixed incomes \u2014 can afford.\" Ethan Rome, head of the advocacy group Health Care for America Now, said the proposal is \"just another version of the Ryan Republican plan to do away with Medicare and bankrupt seniors, but this time it's got one Democrat on board.\" Just because Wyden's on board \"doesn't make it bipartisan,\" Rome said, and the latest plan would ultimately replace \"guaranteed benefits with vouchers.\" Wyden, for his part, said he doesn't think Republicans will be able to use the new proposal to walk away from their support for Ryan's earlier, more radical rewrite of Medicare. \"Nobody ducks their past votes and their previous statements. That's just a given,\" he said. But it appears some Republicans are already trying. Speaking on Iowa Public Television, GOP presidential frontrunner Newt Gingrich called it \"a very important breakthrough\" and \"a bipartisan effort to really come to grips with one of the major entitlement challenges we face.\" And, according to a tweet from Talking Points Memo's Brian Beutler, House Speaker John Boehner called the plan \"a bipartisan idea that's worthy of our consideration\" and \"a step in the right direction.\"",

President Barack Obama  is touting the end  of the almost nine-year war as a fulfilled campaign promise. In an  appearance with Iraq's Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki this week, Obama  said that U.S. troops will leave \"with their heads held high.\" Ted  Koppel recently returned from Iraq as a special correspondent for Rock Center with Brian Williams.  He worries that the U.S. exit will leave Iraq vulnerable to influences  from Iran, and will leave the thousands of security contractors,  humanitarians and other Americans who stay behind in great danger. Host  Neal Conan talks with Koppel, an NPR commentator, about what lies ahead  in Iraq and what the U.S. leaves behind. Medicare and MedicaidUntil earlier this month, Dr. Donald Berwick was the administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. A recess appointment by President Barack Obama, Berwick's  mission was was to make the Centers more efficient and cut costs. But Dr. Berwick has resigned from his position before Senate confirmation hearings could be held. Berwick tells host Neal Conan why he believes so much of what Medicare and Medicaid do is wasteful and of little benefit to patients, and why he wanted to transform the system. Children and PovertyAccording to the Department of  Agriculture, over 21 million kids received free or reduced-price lunch  last academic year, up 17 percent from previous years.  The increase  highlights a large segment of the population bearing the weight of the  bad economy: children.  Many formerly middle-class kids are experiencing  poverty for the first time because their parents may have lost a job,  home, or other assets, which may have long-term psychological impacts.   Host Neal Conan speaks with Joe Wemette, former assistant superintendent  for Roseville Schools in Minnesota, about how the economy has affected  his district.  Neal also speaks with psychologist Katherine Marshall  Woods, about the impact of poverty on children and Taniesha Woods, a  researcher with the National Center for Children in Poverty, about how  schools and teachers can best respond to kids living in poverty. Opinion PageOver the weekend, tens of thousands of Russians took to the streets in Moscow to express their opposition to Vladimir Putin's campaign to return to the presidency. The peaceful demonstrations were set off by last week's parliamentary elections, which some claim were marred by fraud. On Monday, two well-known figures \u2014 a billionaire who is majority owner of the New Jersey Nets basketball franchise and the recently-ousted finance minister \u2014 announced they would challenge Putin in the presidential elections next spring.

Now that he's the frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination, Newt Gingrich's proposals for the economy are drawing much more of the scrutiny you'd expect. And the emerging consensus is that Gingrich is trying to grab the pole position against his GOP rivals with plans for bigger tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans and reductions to businesses than they're his competitors are generally proposing. Gingrich is quick to remind people that he was an early adopter when it came to supply-side economics \u2014 the idea popularized by President Ronald Reagan that tax cuts drive higher economic growth. Thus, it's no surprise that his economics plan shows his undying devotion to the Laffer Curve. One of the best descriptions of Gingrich's approach comes from Jim Tankersley writing for the National Journal: \"It is Reaganomics, cryogenically frozen in 1981, thawed 30 years later, and pumped full of Newt-style steroids in order to save the American people from slow growth.\" The former House speaker proposes a raft of tax cuts and changes that should give the richest Americans something to cheer about. The problem, analysts say, is that Gingrich's plan would explode deficits at the very time policymakers can't agree on how to close relatively smaller budget shortfalls. Gingrich would make permanent the Bush tax cuts that are scheduled to lapse at the end of the next year. But that's just for starters. He would end the capital gains and estate taxes. Even Mitt Romney, who has repeatedly tried to out-conservative his rivals in the GOP presidential race, has said ending the capital gains tax is a bridge too far for him. The former Massachusetts governor would only eliminate the capital gains tax for voters with adjusted gross incomes of $200,000 or less. Wage earners with household incomes of $200,000 or less don't generally get the much of their income year after year from capital gains so Romney's approach is more symbolic than anything else. But many at the top of the income ladder do. For them, Gingrich's approach would be an unmitigated boon. Gingrich would also drop the corporate tax to 12.5 percent from the current 35 percent. Furthermore, the former speaker would offer individual taxpayers the option of a 15 percent flat tax, keeping some deductions like those for mortgage interest and charitable giving. Texas Gov. Rick Perry is only talking about a 20 percent optional flat tax. Gingrich would also get rid of the hated alternative minimum tax which has snagged ever more upper middle income taxpayers. The net effect of all of this would be to turn federal deficits into gushers of red ink even more than they already are, according to Howard Gleckman, writing for the blog of the non-partisan Tax Policy Center. \"In just the single year of 2015, Gingrich's plan would increase the deficit by about $850 billion. Remember, while we are used to seeing numbers such as this describing the 10-year revenue loss of some tax plan, this is just the one-year cost. It is half again as generous as Perry, who would add merely $570 billion to the deficit. Keep in mind that among Gingrich's proposals for economic renewal would be  balancing the federal budget. So he would need to find nearly an extra trillion dollars in spending cuts just to stay even. Given the recent failure of the legislative supercommittee, that doesn't seem likely. More Gleckman: \"Compared to the current law world where the 2001-2010 tax cuts have expired, taxpayers across-the-board do even better. Nearly 82 percent would get a tax cut. About 45 percent of the lowest-earners, and 98 percent of middle-income households come out ahead. For those roughly 130,000 lucky duckies in the top 0.1 percent, the windfall is eye popping. They'd get an average tax cut of $2.3 million. And their total federal tax bill would plunge from 38 percent of their income to barely 10 percent.\" A majority of Americans may repeatedly be telling pollsters that they'd like to see the rich pay more in taxes to help close the nation's deficits but Gingrich's plan seems to take no notice of that. His plan would not only reduce taxes but regulations, too. All the Republican candidates say they would repeal Dodd-Frank, the financial regulation bill passed last year in response to the meltdowns of the housing market and Wall Street. Gingrich also says he would repeal the law known as Sarbanes-Oxley. That law was a response to the Worldcom, Enron and Tyco International scandals in which corporate executives, company boards and accounting firms either engaged in outright fraud or willfully turned a blind eye to same, leading to the loss of jobs, retirement funds and investments for tens of thousands of workers and investors. Sarbanes-Oxley requires corporate officials and auditors to increase their diligence and certify as much. For many executives it has become another regulatory headache. But at the time of the law's passage in 2002, it had an almost unheard of level of support from both parties. It passed the House in a 423 to 3 vote with eight abstentions. In the Senate, it passed with 99 yes votes and one abstention. That's extraordinary consensus in modern Washington. Given that, it's remarkable that Gingrich would be talking about repealing a law that pretty much had universal appeal. Meanwhile, Gingrich has big plans for entitlements. He would try to complete President George W. Bush's vision of transforming Social Security into private savings accounts instead of the government system that now exists. Ditto for Medicare. Medicaid would be turned into block grants back to the state. All in all, it's the Reagan-Gingrich revolution 2.0. While his critics may knock Gingrich for changing his wives or his religious denomination, it appears he has remained fairly steadfast in his conservative tax cutting, regulation-slashing and entitlement-privatizing vision of what the American economy should look like.",

            "article_content": "Mitt Romney has made far fewer visits to Iowa in 2011 than he did during his first run for the GOP nomination four years ago. Friday, Romney appeared in Cedar Rapids, just weeks ahead of the first-in-the-nation Iowa caucuses.  LYNN NEARY, HOST: Mitt Romney was also in Iowa today. His campaign has spent the past several days on the offensive against Newt Gingrich. As Iowa Public Radio's Kate Wells reports, the former Massachusetts governor is facing a bigger challenge than he planned. KATE WELLS, BYLINE: Remember when Mitt Romney wasn't supposed to really need Iowa? (SOUNDBITE OF APPLAUSE) MITT ROMNEY: Thank you, Tom. Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF APPLAUSE) WELLS: Well, just over three weeks from the caucuses, what he needs is for Newt Gingrich not to sweep the early-voting states. So out comes the Romney family. ROMNEY: My wife of 42 years, Ann... (SOUNDBITE OF CHEERING) ROMNEY: ...almost 42 years... (SOUNDBITE OF APPLAUSE) ROMNEY: ...and Josh, my middle son, we have five boys. WELLS: In campaign stops and TV ads, the Romneys are taking center stage. It has the effect of reminding voters of Gingrich's multiple marriages and infidelities. And for this pro-Romney crowd at a mill in Cedar Rapids, it's working. Gay Conlan says she has a serious character issue with Gingrich. GAY CONLAN: I would not ever support him. I remember him from years back. And I just don't think he's trustworthy. I know he has lots of good - lots of ideas, let's put it that way. But I don't know how good they are. And I just don't think he's the man for this job. WELLS: But things have changed since the last time Romney made one of his rare stops in this state. Now, even among Romney fans, the man on voters' minds is the former speaker of the House. The crowd asked several Gingrich-related questions, from his take on Congressman Paul Ryan's Medicare plan to why Romney would be the better debater against President Obama. ROMNEY: A couple of things. One, in debating, there's coming up with the best answers and the best zingers. And number two, there's being able to communicate to the people of America that you're a leader. And the leadership matters. (SOUNDBITE OF APPLAUSE) ROMNEY: And I think I've got the best ideas for our nation. WELLS: And Romney took an indirect dig at Gingrich's frequent references to his background as a historian. ROMNEY: I understand the economy not just as an academic, not just as a politician, but as someone who has worked in the economy for 25 years or more. WELLS: Romney is steadily ramping up on the offensive. He released an anti-Gingrich ad this week. And a pro-Romney Super PAC is snapping up more than $3 million worth of Iowa airtime for TV and radio spots. Their worry isn't just that Romney could disappoint in Iowa, it's that Gingrich could take his momentum from here onto New Hampshire, then South Carolina and so on. DR. DENNIS GOLDFORD: The biggest danger to his campaign for the nomination is that Republicans finally coalesce around an alternative to Mitt Romney. WELLS: Dennis Goldford is a political scientist at Iowa's Drake University. He says Romney's increasing focus on Iowa shows he's getting nervous about Gingrich. GOLDFORD: I think the best thing that Mitt Romney can do in the state of Iowa at this point is to take some of the wind out of Newt Gingrich's sails. What his main goal, I think, from a strategic standpoint is to make sure that nobody comes out of Iowa who might be an alterative to Mitt Romney with a particular head of steam. WELLS: For Romney, winning Iowa is less about finishing first and more about keeping the primaries from becoming a two-man race. For NPR News, I'm Kate Wells in Iowa. Copyright \u00a9 2011 NPR.

            "article_content": "Mitt Romney with supporter John Sununu, the former New Hampshire governor and supporter, accused Newt Gingrich of \"irrational behavior.\"\n                \n                    \n                    Jim Cole/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Mitt Romney with supporter John Sununu, the former New Hampshire governor and supporter, accused Newt Gingrich of \"irrational behavior.\" Mitt Romney's campaign, trying to yank the soaring Newt Gingrich candidacy back to earth, had two pillars of the Republican establishment describe the former House speaker as a political disaster in the making for the GOP should he get the nomination. John Sununu, the former Republican governor of New Hampshire, and Jim Talent, former U.S. senator from Missouri, suggested Thursday that Gingrich had repeatedly disqualified himself over his career from being considered as presidential material. But they singled out Gingrich's infamous criticism of Rep. Paul Ryan's plan to reform Medicare as the epitome of why the former speaker shouldn't be the Republican nominee. And just for good measure Sununu, who served as President George H.W. Bush's White House chief of staff raised the notion that Gingrich might be, ahem, too unstable for the presidency. Sununu and Talent said everything Republicans need to know about why their man Romney should be the nominee and not Gingrich could be seen by how both men reacted to the Ryan plan. The plan put forward by Ryan of Wisconsin who chairs the House Budget Committee, would have eventually converted Medicare from a system of  government provided health insurance for older Americans to a privately provided insurance with recipients receiving government subsidies to pay their premiums. While Romney endorsed the plan and offered his own ideas, Gingrich initially called it \"right wing social engineering,\" then tried fast-talking his way out of a tight spot after fellow Republicans exploded in anger. Sununu was clearly still angry: SUNUNU: \"For Newt Gingrich, in an effort at self-aggrandizement, to come out and throw a clever phrase that had no other  purpose than to try and make him sound a little smarter than the conservative Republican leadership, to undercut Paul Ryan, is the  most self-serving, anti-conservative thing one can imagine happening. \"He gave the liberals and the Democrats the ammunition  they needed to moot, if you will, at least for the time being, Paul Ryan's presentation. Mitt Romney supports what Paul Ryan  did, he endorsed what Paul Ryan did. Mitt Romney had his own package of entitlement reform which Paul Ryan has praised. They both mesh together, both based on understanding  entitlement reform. And Gingrich's undercutting of Paul Ryan makes it clear Newt Gingrich is more concerned about Newt Gingrich than he is  about conservative principles.\" Both men said that if Gingrich is the nominee, the presidential race will become a choice between the often controversial Gingrich, with his reputation for being undisciplined, and the very disciplined Obama. They seemed to have few doubts that Obama would do very well head-to-head against Gingrich. Meanwhile Talent, who served in the House while Gingrich was speaker, recalled some of the unpleasantness of living in Newtworld. He acknowledged that the team under Gingrich had accomplishments like balancing the federal budget and welfare reform (of course, President Bill Clinton had a role in that too.) But Gingrich's well known unpredictability was an issue. \"Yes we got some things done, but we also reached a conclusion that we could not  go on as our leader. We're in a situation where we would get up every morning  and you'd have to see the newspaper what the speaker said that day that you'd  have to clean up in your district. It's exactly why we did what we  did.\" What they did was unsuccessfully try to oust Gingrich in a 1987 coup because he was increasingly seen as a political liability to his party. Gingrich survived that but resigned the following year after Republicans lost a number of seats in the midterm elections. And in case there was any doubt, when Romney's surrogates were asked if they could see Gingrich as the ultimate civilian authority over the U.S. military, Sununu used the moment to raise doubts about the former speaker's stability. SUNUNU: \"Having sat in the White House with a president that was completely reliable,  understood completely the depth of analysis that's required to make the kind of hard decisions  that a president has to make, I strongly reinforce my endorsement of Mitt Romney. \"The off-the-cuff  comment for example that Gingrich throws out on occasion is a reflection of the off-the-cuff thinking that in thinking that he uses.  What he did to Paul Ryan is a perfect example of the kind of irrational behavior you do not want in a commander-in-chief.\" Talent and Sununu promised that Thursday's effort was just the start of effort by the Romney campaign and his supporters to raise doubts about Gingrich by contrasting his career and statements with Romney's. One problem for Romney and his supporters, however, is that there appears to be a solid block with the Republican part of the electorate that may be almost as opposed to having Romney as the nominee as they are to having Obama in the White House. Many Republicans just don't appear to like Romney. The other problem is that this is the first presidential election cycle for Republicans during the Tea Party era. Before the Tea Party, the Republican establishment had more power to dictate outcomes. But it seems like it's going to be a tough trick for establishment figures like Sununu and Talent to sway anti-establishment voters looking to shake things up.",

            "article_content": "With a month to go before Iowa kicks off the 2012 election calendar, Newt Gingrich has improbably found himself as the GOP frontrunner.  \n                \n                    \n                    Charlie Neibergall/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption With a month to go before Iowa kicks off the 2012 election calendar, Newt Gingrich has improbably found himself as the GOP frontrunner. So now it's Newt Gingrich. In what has become the most improbable result of a most improbable campaign season, Gingrich, the former speaker of the House who has been out of public office since 1998, has benefited from a series of well-reviewed debate performances to catapult himself to the top of the GOP presidential pack.  Not just the leading \"Anybody But Mitt (Romney)\" candidate.  The leader, period. As hard as it was to fathom Michele Bachmann or Herman Cain as the Republican frontrunner, this one defies all logic.  Gingrich was all but written off, widely declared dead and buried, back in June when his entire campaign staff (for what it was) quit en masse, with many of them joining that month's new flavor, Rick Perry.  They said Gingrich was not serious about running, that he was more interested in peddling his book and his \"ideas,\" and that he was on a Mediterranean cruise with his wife when he should have been raising money and knocking on doors in Sioux City and Council Bluffs. Back then, the focus of the media was on Romney and Perry.  Period.  There was no time or inclination to pay attention to any other Republican running, be it Gingrich or Bachmann or Ron Paul or Rick Santorum or Jon Huntsman (or, for that matter, Gary Johnson or Buddy Roemer).  And when Perry embarrassed himself in a succession of debates, the ABM crowd shifted to Cain.  The brief swoon over Perry made some sense; the longtime governor of Texas had a reputation as a strong conservative and a ferocious campaigner.  Cain, on the other hand, never served in public office.  But he nonetheless found himself in the limelight with an engaging speaking style and a memorable, if mathematically implausible, \"999\" economic plan. And when Cain's past began to catch up with him, the spotlight shifted to Gingrich. No one saw this coming.  But why should we have?  Gingrich's entire career is pockmarked with the kind of problems that would normally disqualify anyone seriously considering a run for president.  The list is endless.  While speaker of the House (1995-98), he was found to have violated the rules in three instances and was reprimanded by the entire House in a 395-28 vote.  Conservatives began to rebel against some of his policies and pronouncements, and some plotted against his leadership.  He famously whined about being snubbed by President Clinton during a ride on Air Force One to Israel for the funeral of Prime Minister Rabin, which left him widely ridiculed.  He was the perfect foil for Clinton, who won re-election in 1996 in part thanks to out-maneuvering Gingrich and the GOP Congress time and time again.  By the time he resigned under pressure after the 1998 elections \u2014 mostly because of a misplaced focus on the Monica Lewinsky scandal \u2014 he was unquestionably the most unpopular member of the House. Nor have more recent headlines been kind either.  Not long after he attacked Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.) during a GOP debate over Frank's role with Freddie Mac \u2014 he should go to prison, Newt suggested \u2014 it was revealed that Gingrich took some $1.5 million in fees from Freddie as a consultant.  Lobbyists were part of the problem, what was wrong with Washington, he said over and over again.  But when the scrutiny was turned on what he did for Freddie Mac, he was insistent.  The money he received was not for lobbying.  He got it because of his role as a (wait for it) historian. He also initially ripped House Budget Committee chair Paul Ryan's plan to overhaul the Medicare program, a blueprint for many conservatives, dismissing it as \"right-wing social engineering.\"  He later apologized. Add that, plus three marriages and his apparent heresy in recently calling for a more humane immigration policy, and it all might have sunk another contender. But if he was the nation's least popular Republican back in 1996-98, he may be the most popular today.  It's not just the debates; he's just speaking their language.  Plus, it's the lingering doubts about Romney's conservative bona fides, which show no sign of abating.  Gingrich's endorsement by the New Hampshire Union Leader, the state's largest and most influential newspaper, was especially significant for its put down of Romney: \"We are in critical need of the innovative, forward-looking strategy  and positive leadership that Gingrich has shown he is capable of  providing. ... We don't back candidates based on popularity polls or  big-shot backers. We look for conservatives of courage and conviction  who are independent-minded, grounded in their core beliefs about this  nation and its people, and best equipped for the job. ... We would rather back someone with whom we may sometimes disagree than one who tells us what he thinks we want to hear.\" Of course, those with long memories will tell you that the Union Leader endorsement has not always translated into success in the N.H. GOP primary.  The paper backed Rep. John Ashbrook over President Nixon in 1972, Ronald Reagan over President Ford in 1976, Pete du Pont over George H.W. Bush in 1988 and Steve Forbes over John McCain (and George W. Bush) in 2000.  All of these endorsees lost. The Union Leader's track record with endorsements is mixed.\n                \n                    \n                    Ken Rudin collection\n                    \n                \nhide caption (For the record, it also backed some primary winners, including Reagan in 1980, Pat Buchanan (over Bob Dole) in 1996 and McCain in 2008.) And on Saturday, a poll released by the Des Moines Register showed Gingrich jumping into the lead in the Jan. 3 caucuses, garnering 25% among likely attendees, to 18% for Paul and 16% for Romney.  Cain, who since suspended his candidacy, had 8%. In the newspaper's last poll, in late October, Gingrich had 7%.  Cain led with 23%.  Yes, it's been some year. Unlike Bachmann, Perry and Cain, Gingrich seems to be peaking at the right time.  Four weeks to go until Iowa. Cain Suspends. A woman comes forward and says she has had an affair with a leading presidential candidate for more than a dozen years.  The charge comes after a stream of sexual rumors involving other women from his past.  But the candidate, who is married, calls it nothing but lies. The woman is Gennifer Flowers, the candidate is Bill Clinton, and the year is 1992.  As it turned out, it was Clinton, not Flowers, who was apparently lying about their relationship, but voters didn't seem to care; he was elected president that year and re-elected four years later. The headlines looked pretty deja vu-ish this month, as a woman, Ginger White, announced she had had a 13-year affair with Herman Cain, a relative political unknown who had won over the hearts of many who were looking for a Republican to take on President Obama next year.  An apparent history of personal recklessness may have been shared by both Clinton and Cain.  But while it destroyed Cain's candidacy, it only wounded Clinton's. The question that many are asking about Cain, who ended his candidacy on Saturday, is similar to what was asked about Clinton back in '92 (and, for that matter, Gary Hart four years prior): How do you run for president and expect to earn the trust of the American public while you are having an extramarital affair? Let's face it, this was never going to happen.\n                \n                    \n                    Ken Rudin collection\n                    \n                \nhide caption My feeling has always been that that question is between the candidate and his family.   But I always suspected that Cain never gave this question much thought because he never expected to find himself as a leading candidate for the nomination.  My gut told me from the onset that this was always about selling books and giving speeches, and what better way to do that than declare your candidacy for president and take part in the nationally televised debates?  By the time \"999\" became a well-known catch phrase and Cain found himself atop the polls, it was too late to undo or hide his past.  It was bound to come out. On the face of it, a 13-year affair seems far more innocuous than charges of sexual harassment, and if the latter were true \u2014 they have yet to be proven and Cain denies them \u2014 that should have automatically ended his White House aspirations.  There is a huge difference between a consensual affair and harassment.  Being accused of both certainly was of no help.  But offering an economic plan whose details never added up, or a suggestion that an electrified fence between the border of the U.S. and Mexico was the answer to illegal immigration, or not knowing things he should have about Obama's Libya policy, or not caring about who was the president of   Ubeki-beki-beki-beki-stan-stan \u2014 well, we shouldn't have had to wait for Ginger White to come forward to realize the campaign was doomed from the start. Trump to host debate. Donald Trump, the real estate mogul who also had his 15 minutes of being a hot presidential commodity earlier this year, is slated to moderate a Republican debate in Iowa on Dec. 27.  One would think that we've seen enough carnivals this campaign season, but I guess not.   Ron Paul and Jon Huntsman have declined the offer to appear; others are expected to attend.  There's much to commend in the statement Paul campaign chair Jesse Benton gave for his candidate not attending: \"The selection of a reality television personality to host a  presidential debate that voters nationwide will be watching is beneath  the office of the Presidency and flies in the face of that office's  history and dignity. ... To be sure, Mr.  Trump's participation will contribute to an unwanted circus-like  atmosphere.\" Political Updates. I post periodic political updates during the week on Twitter. You can follow me at @kenrudin.  Meanwhile, here's some mail from my in-box: Q:  What would happen if there was no clear winner going into the GOP convention (let's say for argument's sake Rommey has 40% of the delegates, with the rest split evenly among three other candidates)?  Would there be some backroom deals? Would the delegates keep voting until the Draft Pawlenty Movement captures their hearts and minds?  Winter is long in Minnesota. Give me some hope. \u2014 Joe Haus, St. Paul, Minn. A:  The short answer is it's not going to happen, and I'll get to why in a moment.  For decades now we political junkies have been dreaming about the specter of a \"deadlocked convention,\" by which no candidate goes into the nominating convention with the required number of delegates to put him or her over the top.  That used to be a common occurrence. The most extreme example was at the 1924 Democratic convention in New York, which took 17 days and 103 ballots before the delegates finally settled on John W. Davis.  Back then, however, you needed two-thirds of the total delegates to win nomination; that eventually changed to the current requirement of a majority of delegates to win.  No Democratic presidential convention has gone beyond a first ballot since 1952; it was 1948 for the Republicans. But with the advent of the current primary system, it's been exceedingly rare for a national convention to open with more than two candidates still in contention for the nomination.  The main reason for that is the primary system, which really established itself in 1972 (following the Democratic disaster of '68).  Unlike years past where nominees were chosen by party bosses, now it became the voters who did the selecting.  And more often than not, it was clear early in the process whom the nominees would be. That's not to say there hasn't been suspense at the conventions.  The 1976 battle between Gerald Ford and Ronald Reagan wasn't really decided until the GOP delegates made Ford their nominee at the Kansas City convention; similarly, Democrats Jimmy Carter and Edward Kennedy battled all the way to Madison Square Garden in 1980 before Carter won renomination.  But in each case the choice was between two candidates. In theory, the Republican battle in 2012 could go on longer than usual because, for the first time, the GOP has decided to use proportional distribution of delegates for primaries that occur before April.  Previously, the party had \"winner-take-all\" rules that ended the contest much earlier than the Democrats. But who knows what's going to happen this time?  Is Mitt Romney really inevitable?  The White House and the DNC seem to think so \u2014 they are launching daily barrages against him and his history of inconsistencies.  Republicans are less convinced.  For all the ups and downs we've witnessed with the GOP field these past few months, we're fast approaching the moment when voters will have their say. Q:  Your recent mention of former Iowa Gov. Bob Ray reminded me that his lieutenant governor, Terry Branstad, returned to the governorship this year after a 12-year hiatus.  What's the longest period a governor has sat out before reclaiming the job? \u2014 Bruce Gerhardt, Omaha, Neb. A:  Well, certainly one who had a much longer hiatus is back in the saddle  again.  Jerry Brown won two terms as governor of California (elected in  1974 and '78).  He could have sought a third term in 1982 but instead  ran for the Senate, and lost to Pete Wilson.  Brown came back to win the  governorship in 2010 \u2014 28 years after he left that office. Alaska's  Walter Hickel also had a long interruption in governorships.  First  elected in 1966, he resigned in January 1969 to become Interior  Secretary in the Nixon administration.  In 1990, he won back the  governorship. And my Nov. 7 column about the rumors that President Obama will replace Joe Biden as VP with Hillary Clinton brought this comment from Denise Cummins of Champaign, Ill.: Maybe this rumor won't go away because people actually want Clinton as VP \u2014 or as president. I for one would like the Clinton economy back, and, as we all knew back then, both Clintons were responsible for that. But as the election coverage of 2008 showed, the most sexist jerks in America turned out to be Democratic males, especially those between 28 and 34. They consider themselves enlightened because they have put racism aside, but they still firmly hold on to the idea that women are inferior and worthy of scorn. The disrespect they showed Hilary during that campaign was shocking. They could never have gotten away with treating Obama like that because they would have been called out as the jerks they are. Even the Republicans are coming around to the idea of a woman in the West Wing. Why are the Democrats still acting like Neanderthals? Political Junkie segment on Talk of the Nation. Each Wednesday at 2 p.m. ET, the Political Junkie segment appears on Talk of the Nation (NPR's call-in program), hosted by Neal Conan with me adding color commentary, where you can, sometimes, hear           interesting conversation, useless trivia questions, and sparkling   jokes. Last Week's Disappearing Act. Between the Thanksgiving holiday and my attending an education summit with NPR staff and member station reporters in Indianapolis last week, there was no Political Junkie column or ScuttleButton puzzle, and I missed both TOTN and the podcast. But I did get a Junkie nugget out of the conference, and I'm going to share it. One of the people I met was Phyllis Fletcher, a delightful young reporter who specializes in education policy at member station KUOW in Seattle.  It just so happens that Phyllis' late grandfather was Arthur Fletcher, who once headed up the U.S. Civil Rights Commission in the early 1990s and was known as the \"father of affirmative action.\" Fletcher, who died in 2005 at the age of 80, advised four Republican presidents (though battled with many over their civil rights policies), was the GOP nominee for lt. gov. of Washington State in 1968 (losing by a whisker), ran a short-lived bid for the Republican presidential nomination in 1996 and, while director of the United Negro College Fund in the early 1970s, coined the phrase, \"A mind is a terrible thing to waste.\"  In 1954 he became the first black player for the Baltimore Colts.  He also played for the Los Angeles Rams. And he also was the GOP candidate for mayor of Washington, D.C. in 1978, losing to Marion Barry.  The buttons shown here are from that effort. And that, ladies and gentlemen, is why this is called Political Junkie. Oh, and speaking of ScuttleButton:  Because I was away, there was no new puzzle last week.  And that means there's still time to get your answer in for the previous week's contest, which you can see here.  Remember, a randomly-selected winner will be      announced   every Wednesday during the Political Junkie segment on NPR's Talk of the Nation.  Not only is there incredible joy in deciphering the answer, but the winner gets a TOTN t-shirt!  DON'T FORGET TO CHECK BACK HERE ON WEDNESDAY FOR THE NEW PUZZLE.

            "article_content": "Rep. Barney Frank, the long-time liberal voice (and a fast-talking, brusque one at that) who announced he won't be running for re-election, discussed with NPR's Guy Raz, co-host of All Things Considered, the items of unfinished business he plans attend to during his remaining year in Congress. \"Well, there are exactly two. One, protecting the financial reform bill from these right- wing efforts to undermine it. They are running particularly in the house, where they control it, a kind of series of guerilla attacks. I want to try to fight those. \"Secondly, the next fiscal year, 2013, we should be dealing with long-term deficit reduction. And I am determined to do everything I can to make sure that reduction of our excessive worldwide military commitments is a part of that. \"We should be getting out of Afghanistan. We should be pulling troops out of Europe and whittling down the excessive nuclear deterrent because there's no more Soviet Union. \"If we don't put the military into the mix of a balanced deficit-reduction plan than things like Social Security and Medicare and a whole range of domestic quality of life programs will take too big a hit.\" The financial reform law named for Frank and former U.S. senator from Connecticut Chris Dodd, is the bane of many Wall Street executives who view it as a threat to their ability to book the largest profits and therefore make the biggest bonuses possible. Republicans have argued that it is a case of regulatory overreach by the Obama Administration and liberal Democrats. By contrast, some liberals and even a few non-progressives have criticized the law as not going far enough to rein in the financial derivatives that contributed to the 2008 financial meltdown. Frank said the law is already making a difference. \"It is retarding the kind of irresponsibility. Let me give you the first thing that I know it's doing. the biggest single cause, I believe, was loans made to people who shouldn't have gotten those loans. mortgage loans made to people who were too poor to pay them back, who were being given more loan than the house was worth. \"We outlawed those loans. Secondly, you had the derivatives placed on these loans that AIG and others got into. We now say that if you're going to get into the kind of trading with banks and financial institutions that AIG had on derivatives, there's got to be capital behind it. There's got to be margin. \"So we have substantially reduced \u2014 now that isn't yet fully implemented, the mortgage things are. \"But in a few months if the CFTC keeps going you will not have the exposure that AIG had where they owed so much more money than they could possibly pay off. \"Both of those are happening. We are also imposing on banks a requirement that they keep more capital so if they do run into trouble they're less likely to fail. Frank described as a \"major legislative disappointment\" his failure to \"get funding for a trust fund to build rental housing for low-income people.\" \"I've had a two sided view here. First of all, we've been making a mistake in making loans available for home ownership for people who couldn't afford them and weren't in some cases frankly prepared to own a home. \"And instead we weren't putting enough money into rental housing. So the failure to adequately fund an ongoing rental housing situation was my major disappointment.\" Like many on Capitol Hill in both parties, Frank was a strong defender of the huge mortgage giants, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, before their financial problems became so bad that taxpayer bailouts were needed. Conservatives have often pointed to Frank as one of the chief enablers, saying that his support of the two government-sponsored entities was central to the housing collapse. Frank has correctly argued that Republicans controlled Congress and the White House when the worst excesses were building up in mortgage markets generally and at Fannie and Freddie specifically. Still, it's true that Frank was a big booster of expanding home ownership. So his housing comments on All Things Considered had the sound of a mea culpa. Frank, who was in the vanguard of openly gay members of Congress, said he took pride in the part his coming out in 1987 played in the nation's progress in matters of sexual identity. \"It will be my 25th anniversary. I was very frightened when I did it, it turned out unnecessarily. Yeah, I think one of the great success stories in America is the extent to which we have overcome prejudice based on being lesbian or gay, bisexsual, transgender. \"It's not compeletely gone but the end is in sight. And I am proud of my role in that. I think cioming out was a big part of it because reality beats prejudice and presenting people, those of us who are gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender with the reality of who we are, we give an alternative to the prejudice, and the prejudice loses.\"",

            "article_content": "Republican presidential candidate Newt Gingrich speaks to the crowd at the Naples Hilton on Friday in Naples, Fla.\n                \n                    \n                    Scott McIntyre/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Republican presidential candidate Newt Gingrich speaks to the crowd at the Naples Hilton on Friday in Naples, Fla. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich surprised viewers of last week's Republican presidential debate with his take on illegal immigrants. \"If you've been here 25 years and you've got three kids and two grandkids, you've been paying taxes and obeying the law, you belong to a local church, I don't think we're going to separate you from your family, uproot you forcefully and kick you out,\" he said. His GOP opponents accused Gingrich of endorsing amnesty, a policy many conservatives deem unacceptable. But the immigration issue is only Gingrich's latest clash with the right. Past Disagreements The trouble started early in Gingrich's presidential campaign. He announced he was running on May 11. Four days later, on NBC's Meet the Press, he had this to say about fellow Republican Paul Ryan's budget proposal: \"I don't think right-wing social engineering is any more desirable than left-wing social engineering.\" Conservatives who backed Ryan's ideas for changing Medicare and other programs were outraged. Gingrich soon apologized to Ryan and insisted he had been misunderstood. But that week in Dubuque, Iowa, voter Russell Fuhrman confronted Gingrich and called his statement \"unforgivable.\" \"You're an embarrassment to our party,\" Fuhrman said. The \"social engineering\" remark was far from Gingrich's first disagreement with conservatives. For example, though Gingrich opposed last year's health care law, he had long argued for requiring individuals to buy health insurance \u2014 the mandate conservatives despise. \"Unless you have 100 percent coverage, you can't have the right preventive care, and you can't have a rational system,\" he said in 2005 at a health care forum where he shared the stage with his former nemesis Hillary Clinton. \"And so I'm actually in favor of finding a way to say you ought to either have health insurance, or you ought to post a bond.\" What Newt has been extremely good at doing in the past is maintaining those principles, but looking for ways that you reach out to not only a majority in the country, a 51 percent majority, but issues that appeal to 60, 70 and 80 percent of the country. Bob Walker, Gingrich adviser A new \"answers\" section on his campaign website aims to explain some of Gingrich's past positions and personal controversies. In a section on health care, the site says Gingrich has changed his stance on insurance mandates. A Fox News interview is posted on the page, in which Gingrich says: \"I may once have advocated it.  I concluded I was wrong.\" That Climate Change Ad Then there's climate change. Gingrich made an ad with then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in 2008. They're sitting on a loveseat in front of the Capitol building, gazing at each other with goofy smiles. \"We don't always see eye to eye, do we, Newt?\" Pelosi asks. \"No, but we do agree our country must take action to address climate change,\" Gingrich answers. When asked about that collaboration at a recent news conference, Gingrich called it \"probably the dumbest thing I've done in recent years.\" \"Because Nancy Pelosi became so radioactive, it didn't matter why I did it,\" he said. \"It was just dumb.\" A Path To Governing? But Gingrich has often said the demand for ideological purity hurts the GOP because it turns off moderate voters. After taking heat for endorsing a moderate Republican in a special congressional election in 2009, Gingrich had this explanation on C-SPAN: \"You can have a very, very intense movement at 20 percent. You can't govern. To govern, you've got to get 50 percent plus one after the recount,\" he said. Fellow Republican Bob Walker, who served in Congress with Gingrich and is an adviser to his current campaign, says that kind of pragmatism isn't a compromise if the goal is to govern as a conservative. \"What Newt has been extremely good at doing in the past is maintaining those principles, but looking for ways that you reach out to not only a majority in the country, a 51 percent majority, but issues that appeal to 60, 70 and 80 percent of the country,\" Walker says. A Question Of Viability? I think he looks at himself as sort of a benevolent dictator. Only he understands how government can make people's lives better, and that's why we should elect him to be president of the United States, when in reality more government is almost never better. Barney Keller, Club for Growth spokesman That was Gingrich's strategy when he led the Republican Revolution in the 1990s, and it often put him at odds with the right wing of his party. Today's Tea Party conservatives don't like the strategy, either. Lee Edwards, who studies the history of conservatism at the Heritage Foundation, puts it this way: \"Certainly he still has a basic conservative philosophy. But of course what it comes down to is: How do you apply that? And so there's going to have to be an accounting taken of, on balance, is this somebody whom Republicans and conservatives will be comfortable with?\" Not really, according to the conservative anti-tax group Club for Growth. Spokesman Barney Keller says Gingrich has shown flashes of brilliance in promoting free enterprise, but his past support for the bank bailout, for cap and trade and for the Medicare drug benefit are serious disappointments. \"I think he looks at himself as sort of a benevolent dictator,\" Keller says. \"Only he understands how government can make people's lives better, and that's why we should elect him to be president of the United States, when in reality more government is almost never better.\" Gingrich's strong debate performances and enduring reputation as a forceful leader could outweigh those concerns. Edwards at the Heritage Foundation thinks conservative voters may overlook some of Gingrich's baggage if they think he can beat President Obama next fall. \"At the end of the day, the Republicans are going to nominate the man whom they think is not only the most philosophically sound, but the most politically viable and electable,\" Edwards says. This week, the reliably conservative editorial board of the Union Leader, the biggest daily newspaper in the critical early primary state of New   Hampshire, endorsed Gingrich. The paper described him as a \"conservative of courage and conviction.\" The Gingrich campaign hopes Republican primary voters will agree.",

Be prepared with PolitiFact's handy guide to chain emails and other viral messages. \n                \n                    \n                    Marjory Collins/Library of Congress\n                    \n                \nhide caption Many families serve up a helping of political misinformation along with the sweet potatoes. Be prepared with PolitiFact's handy guide to chain emails and other viral messages. At  Thanksgiving dinner, there's probably a good chance you'll end up sitting beside  your uncle. You  love your uncle, but you could do without all those chain emails that he  forwards to you, the ones that claim the government is forcing you to get rid of  your light bulbs, that \"Obamacare\" is going to put a tax on home sales and that  President Obama fits the biblical description of  the Antichrist.  (Note to uncles: We're not singling you out. Chain emails get forwarded by  aunts, grandparents and plenty of other relatives.) So  as part of our Message Machine partnership with NPR, PolitiFact has put together  this handy guide to chain emails and other viral messages. Hide it under the  green bean casserole and you can pull it out if your uncle brings up the chain  emails. You  should start by telling tell him that the emails are nearly always wrong.  PolitiFact has checked 104 claims from emails and rated 80 percent of them  \"False\" or \"Pants on Fire.\" Only 4 percent of the claims have earned a  \"True.\" The  emails, heavy on exclamation points and ALL CAPITAL LETTERS, are typically sent  by conservatives who dislike Obama. Lately, though, we have seen a new  phenomenon on Facebook, where liberal supporters of the Occupy Wall Street  movement have been spreading messages, some of which aren't accurate. (More  about them in a moment.) The  chain emails cover a few broad themes: Obama  is unpatriotic! E-mails have said Obama complained that the troops were whiners (Pants  on Fire),  that he refused to say the Pledge of Allegiance (False)  and that he wants soldiers to take a loyalty oath to him rather than the  Constitution (Pants  on Fire). Democrats  have passed a secret tax! Some  recent emails claim that because of \"Obamacare,\" monthly Medicare premiums will  more than double by 2014 (Pants  on Fire)  and that home sales will be taxed 3.8 percent (Pants  on Fire)  to pay for the new health care law. Another one in this genre says Obama's  finance team is seeking a 1 percent tax on all financial transactions (Pants  on Fire). Perks  of office. Another theme in the emails is that members of Congress get excessive perks.  The emails say members of Congress get full retirement pay after one term  (Pants  on Fire)  and that congressional staffers and members don't have to repay their student  loans (Pants  on Fire). The  government is coming for your guns/health data/light bulbs!  Some of the conspiracy theories are truly wacky. During the health care debate,  one claimed that under the public option for health care coverage, people would  be implanted with data-storing microchips (Pants  on Fire).  A more recent email claimed the government was mandating that everyone get rid  of their existing light bulbs (Pants  on Fire).  Another email said you must list your guns on your tax return (Pants  on Fire). We're  not sociologists, so we don't speculate on why conservatives have been spreading  most of the chain emails \u2014 or why liberals have recently adopted a similar  technique on Facebook for messages supporting Occupy Wall Street. This  week, we checked a widely circulated Facebook post that said 1 percent of  Americans are millionaires compared with 47 percent of House members and 56  percent of senators. We found the numbers were off, particularly for the share  of Americans who are millionaires (actually 9 percent), so we rated it Half  True. Likewise,  many people were posting a message that said Republicans in Congress have  introduced dozens of bills on religion, marriage, abortion and gun control, but  zero bills on job creation. We found that was ridiculously false because the  blog post it was based on included bills from both parties and there was no  category for job creation.  We  rated it Pants  on Fire. The  Facebook messages and the chain emails have this in common: They are spread by  people who are passionate about their political beliefs. That's not a new  phenomenon, of course, but what's different today is that people can spread  their passion so quickly, to so many people, through emails and Facebook. They  impulsively forward the emails and postings without bothering to see if they  are accurate. So  tell your uncle to stop passing along the false emails \u2014 or check PolitiFact  first. But it would be great if he could just pass the mashed  potatoes. Bill Adair is editor of PolitiFact.com and Washington bureau chief for the St. Petersburg Times.",

            "article_content": "President Obama is nominating Marilyn Tavenner to succeed Dr. Donald M. Berwick as administrator of the  Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Tavenner,  who has been the agency's principal deputy administrator, will serve as administrator on an acting basis during the confirmation process, according to an announcement to CMS staff. Berwick was never confirmed by the Senate and instead got a recess appointment from Obama. His  appointment expires Dec. 31, and he'll step down Dec. 2. A  nurse, Tavenner has played a key role in overseeing Medicare, Medicaid and  the Children's Health Insurance Program. In remarks to the National Association  of Medicaid Directors last month, Tavenner shared her thoughts on how to control  health care costs, themes that are very similar to ideas Berwick has expressed  repeatedly throughout his tenure. \"The only way to stabilize costs  without cutting benefits or provider fees is to improve care to those with the  highest health care costs,\" she said. Tavenner also said she opposed Republican  efforts to turn Medicaid into a block grant that would limit the amount of  federal funding states can receive for the program. \"That approach would simply  dump the problem on states and force them to dump patients, benefits or make  provider cuts or all the above,\" she said. Tavenner isn't expected to make big changes.  \"She brings continuity in terms of implementing the mission,\" said Len Nichols, director of George Mason  University's Center for Health Policy Research and Ethics. In an announcement to staff, Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said Tavenner's \"distinguished career in health care and deep knowledge of our efforts to implement health reform make her the right person for this job at this moment in history.\" News of  Tavenner's appointment was first reported by CQ HealthBeat. Before  coming to CMS, Tavenner served as secretary of Virginia's Health and Human  Services department where she oversaw 12 agencies that employed 18,000 people. Her career  also included 25 years working for the for-profit Hospital Corporation of America where she  started as a staff nurse and became president of outpatient services, according  to an alumni profile posted on Virginia Commonwealth University's website. Deep  partisan divides have stopped Congress from confirming Berwick since mid-October  2009, creating instability in the agency that oversees the Medicare and Medicaid  programs. Obama installed Berwick in July 2010 as a  recess appointment, which was heavily criticized by Republicans who accused the  pediatrician of favoring health care rationing \u2014 a charge Democrats dismissed  as nonsense. The current political climate on Capitol Hill may mean that  Tavenner is just as likely to see her nomination stall. A bipartisan panel  charged with finding $1.2 trillion in budget savings over the next decade  deadlocked with members unable to bridge differences over the difficult issues  of taxes and entitlement spending and rancor between the parties is only  expected to grow heading into the 2012 elections.

President Taft said that \"people think the presidents can make the grass grow and the skies turn to blue. It's simply out of their reach.\" Here's a quick survey of how presidents have responded to economic challenges in recent decades: Dwight D. Eisenhower, 1953-1961 Two recessions on his watch help Democrats build up congressional majorities in midterm elections that lasted for decades after. Eisenhower didn't want Republicans to continue to be known as the \"party of Depression,\" but he brushed aside calls from his own advisers in 1957 to support stimulus measures. He vetoed public works projects he believed would take years to get going and opposed what he called \"slash-bang kinds of tax cutting.\" Eisenhower told his chief economic adviser, \"I realize that to be conservative in this situation can well get me tagged as an unsympathetic, reactionary fossil.\" John F. Kennedy, 1961-1963 As a senator, he opposed tax cuts he worried could be \"dangerous\" by inflating the deficit. In the White House, however, JFK proposed major cuts to income tax rates. Deficits were not caused by \"wild-eyed spenders,\" he said, but slow economic growth and recessions. He believed short-term growth would be sparked \u2014 and revenues increased \u2014 by cutting tax rates. His proposal to lower top income tax rates significantly would not be enacted until three months after his assassination. Lyndon B. Johnson, 1963-1969 After seeing through JFK's tax cuts, Johnson increased spending in two ways \u2014 through his Great Society domestic programs, such as Medicare, and the escalation of the Vietnam War. Johnson was warned revenues were needed to finance both \"guns and butter,\" but he worried that support for Great Society domestic spending would drop if he called for a tax increase. He did push one through in his last year in office, but by that time deficits and an overheated economy were set to worsen inflation well into the 1970s. Richard M. Nixon, 1969-1974 Having seen up close how voters reacted when Eisenhower didn't do much to pull the economy out of the trough, Nixon tried everything he could think of to prime the pump. He implemented wage and price controls, cut payroll taxes and devalued the dollar to boost exports. He also leaned on the Federal Reserve to goose the economy in the run-up to the 1972 election. This all helped bring about a huge growth spurt, but the reckoning was soon at hand due owing to oil price shocks and rising inflation. Gerald R. Ford, 1974-1977 In his first address to Congress, Ford called inflation \"public enemy No. 1.\" His WIN buttons \u2014 for \"whip inflation now\"\u2014 were soon widely mocked, and the focus on inflation may have been the wrong move for an economy soon to enter a recession. Ford moved to slash federal spending and also proposed the first income tax hikes since 1968. He soon backed off on the latter idea, pushing for tax cuts instead. Congress balked at cutting spending and cut taxes more than Ford had wished. By 1976, the year Ford ran unsuccessfully for re-election, unemployment was down and inflation had dropped by half from two years before. But because he kept changing positions in reaction to Congress, Ford received little political credit, writes Princeton University historian Sean Wilentz in his book The Age of Reagan. Jimmy Carter, 1977-1981 \"Stagflation\" \u2014 the combination of inflation with slow growth and high unemployment \u2014 had become a concern during Ford's presidency but came to dominate Carter's time in office. He succeeded in enacting a $20 billion stimulus package in 1977, but inflation rose every year during his presidency. Paul Volcker, the Fed chairman Carter appointed in 1977, began raising interest rates to choke off inflation, but this also had the effect of dampening growth. Carter's fiscal conservatism \u2014 he had hoped to bring down federal spending as a share of GDP from 23 to 21 percent \u2014 did not sit well with more liberal Democrats who dominated Congress, so his ability to enact fiscal policies proved limited. \"My reading of Carter was that he never really got on top of economic policy,\" Weatherford says. Ronald Reagan, 1981-1989 The Fed brought prime interest rates above 20 percent early in Reagan's first term, helping to wring inflation out of the economy but also triggering recession. In 1982, monthly unemployment figures averaged 9.7 percent, helping cost the GOP 26 House seats that fall. \"Reagan was below 40 percent in the polls in 1982,\" says Edwards, the Texas A&M scholar. \"There was no narrative that was pleasing to people when unemployment was high and times were tough.\" Reagan's major economic remedy was a massive tax-cut package enacted during his first year in office. He did raise taxes his second year to address deficits, writing in his diary that this was \"the price we have to pay to get the budget cuts.\" But promised spending cuts never really happened, causing deficits to balloon. Still, the initial package of tax cuts and Reagan's acceleration of Carter's policy of deregulating helped bring about a long period of economic growth, as Dallek notes in his book on Reagan. George H.W. Bush, 1989-1993 The national debt tripled on Reagan's watch, so Bush, his former vice president, soon made deficit reduction a top priority. In 1990, he crafted a budget with Congress that lowered the deficit in part by raising taxes. Many analysts say that was the right policy, but politically it was a betrayal of Bush's \"no new taxes\" campaign pledge, costing Bush support among Republicans in Congress and in the 1992 primaries. His general election chances also suffered because of a recession and a widely reported incident in which he appeared to not recognize what a supermarket scanner was. \"Bush was seen as out of touch on the economy,\" Edwards says. \"He was just saying we need to continue the course and things would be all right. Indeed, things did get much better, but the better the economy got, the worse the press reports got.\" Bill Clinton, 1993-2001 Estimates about the size of the deficit as Clinton took office proved much lower than the reality. Clinton pushed through a major deficit-reduction package during his first year in office, which included roughly $250 billion each in spending cuts and tax increases. The package received no GOP votes in Congress, and Senate Republicans also blocked Clinton's $16.3 billion stimulus package in 1993. The tax hikes helped cost Democrats their Eisenhower-era House majority in 1994. Congressional Republicans in 1997 did reach terms with Clinton on a budget package that helped wipe out federal deficits for three years. Getting the nation's books in balance \u2014 along with the dot-com bubble \u2014 helped Clinton preside over the longest unbroken economic expansion in U.S. history. George W. Bush, 2001-2009 The dot-com bubble burst just before Bush took office. Soon after, he sold Congress on the first in a series of major tax cuts. Economic growth continued during most of Bush's time in office, but the country slipped into recession in 2007, caused by the sudden drop in the housing market. The following year, the collapse of the financial markets led to a major bailout package for the banking industry. Job growth, which was weaker under Bush than under any other postwar president, had come to a halt. The national debt, meanwhile, had doubled on Bush's watch. Barack Obama, 2009-present Most postwar recessions were short and shallow, but economic downturns triggered by financial markets tend to last several years. The $800 billion stimulus package that Obama signed during his first month in office helped stave off worse conditions, in the eyes of many economists, but didn't bring down persistently high levels of unemployment far enough. There's also a perception, Weatherford says, that Obama's economic measures did more to help banks and domestic automobile companies than struggling homeowners and average workers. Obama inherited a worse economic situation than any president since Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1933, but his inability to restore confidence makes his re-election prospects uncertain. \"People may not blame Obama for the economy,\" Edwards says, \"but they blame him for not fixing the economy.\"",

Generation Xers \u2014 grown up now and in their 30s and 40s \u2014 are feeling hardest-hit by the recession, and are the most divided over the presidential candidates for 2012, according to a new report by the Pew Research Center. Generation X has always been a diverse demographic and hard to peg, politically or otherwise.  Older members came of age idolizing President Reagan, at a time when Hollywood's Gordon Gekko became an icon with his declaration that \"greed is good.\"  Younger members revered the saxophone-playing President Clinton and were dubbed the MTV generation, defined by slackers and grunge. \"They are a generation that was brought up in the boom days to some extent,\" says Pew researcher Michael Dimock.  \"Their early adulthood was the 1990s, and those were great times.  And now this economy has turned around on them, and many are feeling more pinched than any other generation.\" The Pew survey on generational politics finds a big spike in Generation Xers' concern about their personal financial situation.  Dimock says that for many, the impact of the recession seems to be cumulative. \"When we interviewed Xers two years ago, they weren't thinking about retirement,\" Dimock says.  \"They had other problems.  But now they're becoming increasingly worried about having enough money to get through their retirement.\" Jazz legend Lionel Hampton (right) gestures toward then-President Bill Clinton at the White House in 1998.

Younger members of Generation X revered the saxophone-playing Clinton. That's true for people like Dan Sullivan, 36, with decades of employment ahead of him. \"I don't see myself retiring.  I don't think it's possible,\" Sullivan says, pushing his 3-month-old son in a stroller in downtown Frederick, Md., a colonial-era town of red brick storefronts.  Sullivan is an active-duty soldier and says he has been sheltered from a lot of the economic turmoil.  But like a third of Generation X, according to the Pew poll, he has lost faith in the social programs set up to cushion old age. \"I don't think Social Security's going to be there for us,\" he says.  \"And Medicare, I don't think that's gonna be there.  And, even if so, at this point I don't want the government's Medicare. I think you have to plan to be totally independent.\" Although Sullivan admits that doesn't actually seem possible either. Sullivan is a lifelong conservative, but he's not thrilled with any of the GOP presidential candidates.  In a hypothetical matchup between President Obama and Mitt Romney? \"I'd probably lean a little bit more towards Romney,\" he says, \"but I don't think he's all that great either.\" Hard Hit By Housing Crisis A block away, 33-year-old Leah Fuhrman-Fell sits with her dog outside the Starbucks where she is a barista. I don't see myself retiring.  I don't think it's possible. Dan Sullivan, soldier \"Obviously I'm not making any money right now for retirement,\" she says. Fuhrman-Fell is making plans to get back into her former field of Internet marketing; she says her fiance is a gainfully employed architect.  Still, like many Generation X members, they had the misfortune to buy their house at the height of the market. \"Oh, we're screwed!\" she says, laughing.  \"The house next door to us went into foreclosure for less than half what we paid.  We'll never leave.\" Fuhrman-Fell is a lifelong liberal, although like many Gen Xers she says she is open to persuasion.  As a group, Generation X leaned Democratic in 2008, then Republican in the 2010 midterms.  Fuhrman-Fell says she likes some Republican politicians, but none are moderate enough to get her vote. Born: 1965-1980. Current age: 31-46 Source: Pew Research Center \"But I still really like Barack Obama,\" Furhman-Fell says.  \"I think that he's been too nice.  But I think if he comes in for a second term, he'll do what he wants to do, and I hope that's what he does.\" Today, the Pew survey finds that a majority of Generation Xers have an unfavorable view of the Republican Party.  Most are also disappointed with President Obama.  They're not as down on him as older voters, but then the older generation never got on the Obama bandwagon to start with, researcher Dimock says. \"I think the Xers and boomers in some respects have moved farther on Obama,\" Dimock says, \"going from being supporters to at least on the fence, if not somewhat unhappy with what he's done.\" The Pew survey finds an even split in Gen X support for President Obama and Mitt Romney.  Those on either side, though, say they're waiting to be impressed.",

At the Defending the American Dream Summit on Friday in Washington, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney spent about 30 minutes methodically laying out the steps he would take to balance the budget. \n                \n                    \n                    Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption At the Defending the American Dream Summit on Friday in Washington, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney spent about 30 minutes methodically laying out the steps he would take to balance the budget. Their speeches came as a new Washington Post-ABC poll found they're running almost even among Republican voters. And on Friday, the two candidates underscored the differences in their appeal to activists. When Romney took the stage, he tried to warm up the crowd with a couple of jokes. One was about President Obama's job creation plan: \"He keeps telling people we can't wait, to which I say: 'Yes, we can.' \" The crowd's response? Some laughter and polite applause. Cain got a much more enthusiastic response a few minutes later, when he cracked this joke: \"Before I get started, I want to know whose teleprompters are these, because I don't need 'em!\" Mitt Romney, Corporate Executive Romney had used the teleprompters as he spent about 30 minutes methodically laying out the steps he'd take to balance the budget. The former Massachusetts governor said his experiences in business, in turning around the Olympics and in the governor's mansion prove that he can fix an economy. \"When I get to the White House, hopefully, no one will need to teach me how to balance budgets. I've been doing that for 35 years,\" Romney said. He supports amending the Constitution so that Congress must pass a balanced budget every year. And he said he'll apply this test to government spending: \"Is this program so critical, so essential, that we should borrow money from China to pay for it?\" Romney said he'd save trillions by overhauling Medicare. \"The future of Medicare,\" he said, \"should be marked by competition, by choice and by innovation, rather than by bureaucracy, stagnation  and bankruptcy.\" Romney would give the next generation of Medicare recipients a sum of money and a variety of plans to choose from. The problem, according to budget expert Stan Collender, is that these kinds of changes are so unpopular that they'll never pass Congress. \"We've already seen that Republicans and Democrats in Congress ultimately don't go along with big, big changes in Medicare and Medicaid, such as the ones that he's proposing,\" says Collender, a former Democratic staffer on the House and Senate Budget committees, who is now with Qorvis Communications. Collender says what makes Romney's budget plan even more unrealistic is its reliance on a 4 percent growth rate for the U.S. economy. \"This is remarkably like, and analogous to, Michele Bachmann saying that she was going to make gasoline $2 a gallon without saying how she was going to get there from here,\" Collender says. \"You can't just pick a number out of a hat and hope you're going to get there. Instead, you should be projecting things on the worst-case scenario, and if it happens a little bit faster because you underestimate it, so be it.\" Romney also said he would cut the federal workforce by 10 percent, limit government salaries, and consolidate some functions, because, as he put it, \"too many chefs not only spoil the broth \u2014 they make it inedible and prohibitively expensive.\" Herman Cain, Conquering Hero If Romney seemed at times to be a corporate executive at a board meeting, received with warm applause, Cain came on as a kind of conquering hero, greeted with standing ovations. Republican presidential hopeful Herman Cain arrives at a summit for the conservative Americans For Prosperity foundation in Washington on Friday. Days after sexual harassment allegations surfaced, he was greeted here with standing ovations. \n                \n                    \n                    Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Republican presidential hopeful Herman Cain arrives at a summit for the conservative Americans For Prosperity foundation in Washington on Friday. Days after sexual harassment allegations surfaced, he was greeted here with standing ovations. The biggest came when he said how proud he is to know David and Charles Koch, the wealthy brothers who established the foundation that sponsored the conference and many other institutions of the conservative movement. \"I am the Koch brothers' brother from another mother,\" said Cain. \"Yes! I'm their brother from another mother \u2014 and proud of it!\" Cain did not mention the sexual harassment allegations that emerged earlier this week and dominated much of the campaign news. He did talk, however, about his 9-9-9 tax plan, and he said foreign policy has to clarify who America's friends and enemies are. It was not a policy speech to match Romney's \u2014 but the audience didn't seem to mind.",

Members of the silent generation are more likely to vote for Republicans than for Democrats, according to a recent study by the Pew Research Center. When next year's election comes around, it looks like the so-called silent generation \u2014 those who are now 66 to 83 years old \u2014 won't be so silent. A new report shows that this group is angrier with politics right now than any other generation in the U.S., and that is prompting it to pay close attention to the 2012 presidential election. Its members express \"not just frustration with Washington but real anger,\" says Andrew Kohut, president of the Pew Research Center. \"Thirty percent of them say, 'I'm angry.' If you look at the youngest voters, it's only 13 percent.\" The center's report, \"Generational Politics,\" examines views across four age groups labeled the millennial generation (ages 18 to 30); Generation X (ages 31 to 46); baby boomers (ages 47 to 65) and the silent generation. Pew researchers conclude that a generation gap \u2014 between millennials and silents \u2014 is growing. Younger voters now consider themselves more liberal, and older voters say they are becoming more conservative. The silent generation turned 18 during the Truman, Eisenhower and Kennedy presidencies \u2014 after World War II and in the shadow of the \"greatest generation.\" The highly polished McGuire Sisters were one of the teenage musical sounds of this generation. As members of the silent generation raised families, their  conservatism deepened. Small government has been a mantra for them. In 2008 they were the only generation to favor John McCain over Barack Obama. A woman holds a sign during a rally to protect federal health programs in California. A report by the Pew Research Center shows that 45 percent of silent generation members say Social Security is the issue that will matter most in deciding their vote in the next election. \n                \n                    \n                    Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption As the 2012 election gets closer, their anger has them more engaged in politics than other generations. \"We look at the question of how much thought they've given to the election,\" says Kohut.  \"Four years ago only 36 percent of this generation said they were giving a lot of thought; now it's up to 42 percent.\" At the same time, Kohut says, millennial voters are less engaged than they were four years ago, when they turned out for President Obama by a 2-to-1 margin. NPR talked with a group of people \u2014 all in the silent generation age group \u2014 as they waited for a free movie to begin at the Wissahickon Valley Public Library in Blue Bell, Pa., on Nov. 1. \"The younger people, they have no clue as to what's really going on out there,\" says James Farrell, 69, of Fort Washington,  Pa. He worries about the economy and how that will affect his finances in retirement. The Silent Generation Born: 1928-1945; turned 18: 1946-1963; current age: 66-83 Source: Pew Research Center Others in the group say the millennial generation doesn't know how good life can be in the U.S. They think back to when Dwight Eisenhower, Ronald Reagan or even Bill Clinton was president and say it was much better then. \"I think the country is in a huge mess,\" says Marjorie Lukens, 80, of Ambler, Pa. She's a registered Republican but votes across parties and is dissatisfied with both the GOP and the Democrats. \"The Republicans are blocking everything Obama wants to do and cooperation has become a dirty word,\" says Lukens. \"And I'm not sure Obama knows what he's doing.\" The problems extend beyond politics to the culture, says Linda Cohen, 67, of Fort   Washington, Pa. She points to medical dramas on television to illustrate her concern. \"When you watched Marcus Welby \u2014 Dr. Marcus Welby \u2014 on TV, it's not like a Grey's Anatomy or Private Practice that you have today, where everybody is getting into bed with everybody else,\" says Cohen who attributes the change to a loss of \"family values.\" [Members of the silent generation express] not just frustration with Washington but real anger. Thirty percent of them say, 'I'm angry.' Andrew Kohut, president of the Pew Research Center Recent episodes of Grey's Anatomy feature a lesbian couple who also are mixed race \u2014 a sign of the times in an increasingly diverse country. But things like mixed-race marriages and homosexuality don't sit well with many in the silent generation. \"What comes through in the survey \u2014 there is a feeling of discomfort or lack of comfort with modern America among many older people,\" says Kohut. \"And I think it has something to do with some of the signs that they see, that this is not necessarily the America that they knew.\" While the silent generation identifies closely with Republicans, Kohut says there is one issue that's a wild card: Social Security. The generation's members are big supporters of it and Medicare and they're as likely to favor Democrats on this issue as they are Republicans. The question is whether that one issue is important enough to swing some voters who are over 65 toward President Obama \u2014 and away from a Republican challenger \u2014 next November. Given how engaged the silent generation is in this election, over the next year expect to hear candidates talking a lot about Social Security and Medicare.",

Steve Israel, the New York congressman who chairs the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. The lawmakers who are chosen to lead their party's efforts to pick up seats in Congress seem congenitally wired to exude confidence about their prospects. That's why their colleagues chose them to play that role, in the first place. So it's usually wise to discount their optimism to some degree. Still, Rep. Steve Israel, the New York Democrat who chairs the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, had more reasons to sound upbeat in a conversation with All Things Considered co-host Melissa Block than he might have had only a few months ago. House Democrats, for instance, outraised their Republican counterparts in the third quarter $14.2  million to 10.7 million. Still, On the way to losing majority control of their chamber, House Democrats lost 63 seats in 2010. To regain sway over the House, they would need to pick up more than two dozen seats. That's a lot of ground to make up and a number of political analysts have doubted they could do so. MELISSA: You'd  need to pick up 25 Republican seats if you're going to get back the majority. It's pretty daunting. How do you get there? ISRAEL: Well, actually, it's not that daunting. Look, we did get shellacked we got thumped in 2010. We picked ourselves up, we dusted ourselves off. We began fighting back. Fighting back against Republican policies to end Medicare in order to fund tax cuts for the big oil companies And as a result of the fact that we have fought back, we are in line to take the House back, the House is in play. We have outraised the House Republican by almost $4 million, year to date. That is unprecedented that the party in the minority would outraised the Republicans. We have out-recruited them. We have 60 districts filled with strong recruits in competitive races and we only need 25. And the reason for those successes quite honestly is not just that we're that good but that the Republican voting records are that bad. There's buyers' remorse that has set in among voters throughout the country because of the House Republicans' voting record, because of their extremism. That's why we believe we have a shot at taking back the House. Israel's interview is complemented by a piece by Andrea Seabrook, also on All Things Considered, which reported on the less-than-impressive fundraising results of  House Republican freshmen like Rep. Renee Ellmers of North Carolina. An excerpt: REP. ELLMERS: Well you know I did have a slow third quarter, I definitely could have done better. ANDREA: North Carlina's Renee Ellmers. For the months of July, August and September, she raised roughly $97,000. REP. ELLMERS: It wasn't as high a priority for me, I will say that my fourth quarter will be much better though. ANDREA: You're workin' it. REP. ELLMERS: I have to work it. I have to work it. ANDREA: Ellmers says she's gotten a lot of advice in the week since her numbers came out. Mentors, she says, explaining to her that she has to work much harder. REP: ELLMERS: That's quickly one of the things that I noticed when I got here.",

            "article_content": " Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul is escorted to a ballroom to speak to his supporters during the California Republican Party Convention this September in Los Angeles. The Texas congressman was once a small-town doctor who specialized in delivering babies. Creating work for unemployed Americans will be the top priority  for whoever wins the 2012 presidential race. In a series of profiles, NPR looks at a key job that each Republican presidential contender held before running for office. Sixth in a series Republican presidential candidate and Texas Congressman Ron Paul is known for his fervent opposition to armed intervention overseas and the Federal Reserve \u2014 and for his equally fervent supporters. And while those supporters may want him to be the next president for different reasons, they're all well aware that before entering politics, Paul was a doctor back in the southeast  Texas district he represents in the U.S. House. \"I think that by being a doctor he's able to address the root causes and not just treat the symptoms of these problems that we're facing as Americans,\" says Sean Donovan, a supporter from Boston. \"And I think that it is truly admirable, his willingness to go that extra step and have a principled approach, and that he doesn't pander to his audience.\" Others are simply impressed by his medical resume. \"I think it's pretty cool that he delivered over 4,000 babies, and I think that gives him a leg up on understanding health care issues,\" says Donna Rode, of Halifax, Pa. And he really did deliver 4,000 babies, says Donna Paul, who worked as Ron Paul's scrub nurse for 14 years in Lake Jackson, Texas, before marrying one of the doctor's brothers and becoming his sister-in-law. \"They kind of figured it out; it was like one a day for a long time, and I said, 'No, it's more like one a night,' \" she says.  Ron Paul, shown in this screen shot taken from his website, says he delivered more than 4,000 babies in the Texas district where he used to practice. Born: Aug. 20, 1935 in Pittsburgh Family: Married to Carol Paul since 1957; five children, Ronald, Lori, Rand, Robert and Joy; 18 grandchildren Education: Gettysburg College, B.S. (1957); Duke University School of Medicine, M.D. (1961) Career: Flight surgeon in the U.S. Air Force and Air National Guard; medical doctor in private practice Elected Office: U.S. House of Representatives (1976-1977; 1979-1985; 1997-present) Indeed, says Donna Paul, when Ron Paul first set up shop in 1968, he was the only obstetrician in town. \"So he went for like three years without ever leaving Lake Jackson; 24-7,\" she says. \"He had no [other doctor] to sign out to.\" Eventually Paul got so busy he took on a partner. Jack Pruett, who was then fresh out of his obstetrics/gynecology residency, says when he first sat down in Paul's office, he was told there were two stipulations he would have to agree to before joining the practice. \"He said, 'No. 1 is we will not perform any abortions.' And I said, 'That's fine; I can live with that. What's No. 2?' \" he remembers. No. 2, says Pruett, was that the practice would not participate in any federal health programs, which meant, as Paul described it, \"that we will see all Medicare and Medicaid patients free of charge, and they will be treated just like all of our other patients, but we're not going to charge them and accept federal funds.\" Still in debt from his medical training, Pruett said that was a little harder for him to swallow. \"But I liked Ron, so I decided that I would agree to that, too. And in all those 20 years, we never accepted one penny of federal money. We saw all those patients for free, delivered their babies free, did their surgeries free; whatever they needed we did, and we didn't charge them.\" Of course, Lake Jackson being a small town, occasionally Paul would get paid in other ways. \"Some of the people would bring chickens, or they would bring vegetables from their garden if they couldn't afford to pay for their obstetrical fee,\" recalls Richard Hardoin, a pediatrician who used to care for the babies Paul delivered. In the mid-1970s, Paul decided to run for Congress to fill an unexpected vacancy \u2014 and won. But he didn't give up his practice, at least not at first. \"Back in those years Congress didn't work on Friday, and so every Friday he would fly back to Lake  Jackson,\" says Pruett, \"and he would help me then on Friday and Saturday, and oftentimes take call on Sunday, and oftentimes catch the red-eye back to Washington on Monday. And I guess he did that every single week for nine years.\" But he's never changed any of his long-held views for political gain, say those who knew him then. Abortion is a good example. Although he ran for president as a libertarian in 1988, Paul breaks with most members of that party (and many in his medical specialty) in that he opposes the procedure. In a speech before the Ames Straw Poll in Iowa in August, Paul said he turned against abortion during his medical training in the 1960s, when many doctors were doing abortions in violation of the laws at the time. \"One day I walked into an operating room, and they did a hysterotomy, which is a cesarean section, lifted out a baby that was crying and breathing, and put it in a bucket in the corner of the room and let it die, and pretended nobody heard it,\" he told the audience. Meanwhile, just down the hall, he said, a baby about the same size was being born prematurely, he said, \"and all of a sudden 20 people, nurses and doctors, all [were] rushing around to save the baby's life, which seemed very logical.\" Paul said he reached an inescapable conclusion from that event: \"We cannot play God and make those decisions; all life is precious.\" But Paul doesn't toe the anti-abortion line as zealously as some of his fellow GOP candidates. He wouldn't ban the so-called morning-after pill, for example, which some activists say prevents a fertilized egg from implanting in a woman's uterus. \"There are circumstances where doctors in the past have used certain day-after pills for somebody with rape, and quite frankly, if somebody is treated, you don't even know if a person is pregnant, you don't even know if there's a disease; but if it's 24 hours after rape, I don't know how you're going to police it,\" he said. \"It doesn't make any sense to me in a practical matter.\" One position that probably does satisfy both Republicans and libertarians, however, is that Paul believes that all health insurance should be voluntary. And if an uninsured 30-year-old needs expensive medical care? That was the hypothetical posed by CNN's Wolf Blitzer at the debate co-sponsored by the Tea Party Express in September. Replied Paul: \"That's what freedom is all about; taking your own risks. This whole idea that you have to prepare and take care of everybody ...\" Paul said \"no\" when Blitzer interrupted to ask if he meant that \"society should just let him die?\" But it turns out the case wasn't so hypothetical. In 2008, 49-year-old Kent Snyder, who ran Paul's presidential bid that year, was struck by pneumonia. He died a few weeks later \u2014 without health insurance \u2014 and reportedly with more than $400,000 in unpaid hospital bills. Even that, however, hasn't made a dent in Paul's position. And as he's proved over and over again in both his medical and political careers, Paul has satisfied his constituency by taking positions and sticking to them.",

Perry toured the factory and then highlighted an optional 20 percent flat tax and a deficit reduction plan. Rick Perry doesn't have a catchy marketing slogan for his tax plan.  But he's hoping the idea of a flat, 20 percent income tax rate will do for his campaign what \"9-9-9\" did for Herman Cain's. \"We need a tax code that unleashes growth instead of preventing it; that promotes fairness, not class warfare,\" Perry said during a speech at the ISO Poly Films factory Tuesday in Gray Court, S.C. The flat tax, a system of taxing income at a single uniform rate, has been used as early as 1861. Looking for capital to finance the Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln signed into law a 3 percent flat tax. The tax eventually evolved into a progressive tax and was repealed a decade later. The nation's first and only true flat tax, of 2 percent, was implemented for a period of one year in 1894. Since then, politicians and economists have used the term liberally. Many have pushed for the flat tax by arguing that it would simplify taxes by reducing the paperwork to the size of a postcard. As GOP presidential candidate Rick Perry unveils his flat tax plan, scroll through our timeline to take a look back at the history of the flat tax. -- Tasnim Shamma Perry stood next to a pallet piled high with paper, representing the current tax code, then held up a postcard, representing his own plan. Perry says anyone who's afraid of paying more under his plan can opt for the old tax system instead. \"You can continue to pay your taxes, as well as the accountants and the lawyers, under the current tax system that we've got, or you can file your taxes on this postcard,\" Perry says. Under Perry's plan, the first $12,500 of income would be tax-free, and popular tax breaks for mortgage interest and charitable contributions would continue. Roberton Williams of the Tax Policy Center says because taxpayers would have a choice of how to file, there's less danger of shifting the tax burden from the wealthy to the poor. \"It might complicate their lives trying to figure out which one is better. But ... nobody is worse off,\" Williams says. \"But it also means revenues will be a lot lower than they otherwise would be.\" That means Perry's plan has the potential to blow a Texas-sized hole in the federal budget. He's promised to avoid that through deep cuts in federal spending. \"The flat tax will unleash growth,\" Perry says. \"But growth is not enough. We must put a stop to the entitlement culture that risks the financial sovereignty or solvency of this country for future generations.  I mean, the red flags are alarming.\" In the past, Perry has described Social Security as a \"Ponzi scheme.\" On Tuesday, he promised to protect benefits for people who are already retired or close to it.  But for future retirees, he wants to raise the eligibility age of both Social Security and Medicare.  He spoke favorably about replacing Medicare's guaranteed health benefits with a government subsidy seniors could use to buy private insurance.  And he favors giving younger workers the option of putting some of their Social Security payments into private accounts \u2014 an idea that would worsen the system's finances in the short run. \"Liberals think the American people can't be trusted to safeguard even a portion of their retirement dollars,\" Perry says. \"I happen to think it is time to end the nanny state and empower our people to exercise greater control over their money.\" In addition to cuts in Medicare and Social Security, Perry called for sharp reductions in federal spending on education, energy and the EPA.  He supports a balanced-budget amendment, but suggested the Pentagon might be spared the budget ax. Like many of the other Republicans in the presidential race, he wants to roll back health care and financial regulations, and review all new government rules put in place in the past three years. \"The federal nanny state's heavy-handed regulations are keeping our economy in the ditch,\" Perry says. \"It is time to review and scrap regulations that are harming jobs and killing growth.\" Perry suggests his Republican rivals are merely nibbling around the edges, while his proposal represents dramatic change.  Perry's plan would cap federal spending at just 18 percent of the U.S. economy.  It hasn't been that low since 1966.",

            "article_content": "As Mitt Romney's opponents  continue to compare \"Romneycare\" unfavorably  with \"Obamacare,\" we decided to  take another look at the plans'  similarities and differences. For additional  insight, we turned to John  McDonough, director of Harvard's Center for Public  Health Leadership. McDonough  brings a unique  perspective to the issue. He served as a top adviser  on the national health care  overhaul plan, and played a key role in  advancing and implementing the  Massachusetts law. His new book, Inside National Health Reform, details  the effort that led to the national overhaul, including his work on   the issue with Massachusetts Sen. Edward Kennedy, who died in  2009. NPR's Liz Halloran: The major element of both plans is the  requirement that individuals  purchase health insurance, the so-called individual  mandate. What are  the bottom-line similarities and differences in the  Massachusetts  mandate and the mandate included in the federal  legislation? John McDonough: A  little context first. When people say that the federal Affordable  Care Act (ACA)  is modeled after the Massachusetts plan, what they  really mean is that Title 1  of ACA is modeled after the Massachusetts  plan, and pretty much nothing else [is]. And there are nine substantive  titles in the law, so there is a lot in the ACA  that has little or  nothing to do with Massachusetts reform. There are four key  pillars  of the Massachusetts plan that are all included in the ACA:   insurance market  reforms, the individual responsibility mandate, the  premium and cost-sharing  subsidies to low- and moderate-income  households, and the exchange \u2014 known as  the \"connector\" in  Massachusetts. Though each of the four is done differently in  both  plans, the essential architecture is the same.  And there is no doubt  that  the inspiration for Title 1 came from the folks in D.C. learning  from the  Massachusetts experience. Of the four, the mandate is   perhaps the most similar, and it's not really a \"mandate\" in either law.   It is  a tax penalty, enforced by the respective federal or state tax  collection  entity, which is imposed on those who can afford to buy  insurance and who do not  do so. Both have religious exemptions, and  neither is imposed on low-income  uninsured persons. The dollar  penalties vary, though not by a lot.  Both are  strikingly similar. Halloran: Former Gov. Romney has said that, if  elected, his first act as  president would be to issue waivers to every single  state, allowing  them to opt out of requirements of the federal health care plan. McDonough: He  cannot do that. Romney says he will do it by using the state waiver  authority in  Section 1332 of the ACA. But that section does not permit  the issuance of any  state waiver until 2017 at the earliest. There is a  bill proposing to move up  that date to 2014, but even that would not  allow Romney to do what he says he  plans to do on day one in January  2013. He's either misinformed, or he thinks no  one will notice the 2017  date. And he's wrong. Halloran: What did you  learn in helping craft the  Massachusetts plan that you brought to the  table when putting together the  national plan? McDonough: There were more lessons than you can shake a stick at, and far more than can be  relayed here. Here are a few: Halloran: How has the plan worked in Massachusetts,  and how have residents and  taxpayers there responded? I'm looking at the Harvard  SPH/Boston Globe poll  of 2009 that suggests 59 percent support the Massachusetts universal health insurance law, and nearly 80 percent say the law should be   continued, either as it stands or with some changes. McDonough:  An  Urban Institute survey pegs public support for the law between 66  and 69  percent. Opposition is low. The plan worked well to accomplish  what was  intended: to dramatically lower the number of uninsured in  Massachusetts. It was  not structured to solve the cost problem, which  has not been solved, though the  law has triggered the most robust  cost-of-quality process in any state in the  nation. It was not intended to  solve workforce shortages, and it hasn't.  Massachusetts still has the  highest proportion of medical professionals of any  state, and only 11  percent of the state's doctors think the law should be  repealed. A  business-supported state budget watchdog says the law increased the   state budget by less than 1 percent \u2014 not a budget-buster at  all. Halloran: If you were advising Romney, how would you  suggest he defend the Massachusetts plan? McDonough: I  would urge him to say: \"I am proud that the law I signed did what it  was  intended to do. It has lowered the number of uninsured in  Massachusetts so much  that no other state is our peer. Massachusetts  proved that this national shame  of the uninsured does not have to be,  and we can fix it without breaking the  bank.\" He could say that,  while  there is a lot in the national plan that he doesn't support \u2014 new  taxes, the big  hand of the federal government, the intrusion into  state prerogatives \u2014 there  is a lot in the law that he does support and  would not want to repeal. For  example, there are provisions to combat  violence, neglect and financial  exploitation of our senior citizens.  There is the Indian Health Reauthorization  Act, more than 20 years in  the making.  There are breakthrough provisions to  combat fraud and  abuse in Medicare, Medicaid and private insurance. Suggest  repeal of  what he doesn't like, but say he won't throw the baby out with the   bathwater.",

Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney signs into law a new health care bill on April 12, 2006, in Boston. The late Sen. Ted Kennedy peers over his shoulder. Former Massachusetts Gov.  Mitt Romney appears to be headed into the 2012 GOP presidential primary season  as the consistent, if not overwhelming, favorite for his party's  nomination. But there remains great  discomfort among a wide swath of party members over the striking similarity of  the Massachusetts health care reform legislation Romney signed in 2006 as governor,  and the federal health care overhaul President Obama put his signature on last  year.  President Obama, surrounded by lawmakers and guests, signs health care insurance legislation during a ceremony in the East Room of the White House on March 23, 2010. While Romney has  alternately distanced himself from and taken credit for the Bay State law, his role in  what former opponent Tim Pawlenty called \"Obamneycare\" could be a major obstacle to winning the GOP nomination. The Massachusetts plan  includes the requirement that individuals purchase insurance \u2014 which is also the most  controversial aspect of the federal legislation. Legal challenges to its  constitutionality are expected to ultimately be decided by the U.S. Supreme  Court.

            "article_content": " Republican presidential hopeful Herman Cain gestures during a speech at the Values Voter Summit in Washington, D.C., on Oct. 7.  Republican presidential hopeful Herman Cain gestures during a speech at the Values Voter Summit in Washington, D.C., on Oct. 7. An NBC/Wall Street Journal poll out this week puts a new name at the top of the race for the Republican presidential nomination: Herman Cain. The poll shows the former head of Godfather's Pizza at 27 percent, with former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney just 4 points behind. Cain spoke with Weekend Edition Saturday host Scott Simon about his surge to front-runner status. Scott Simon: So how do you keep your campaign from going the way of Mitt Romney, Rick Perry, Michele Bachmann, Donald Trump \u2014 for that matter, every other front-runner? Herman Cain: Here's how I prevent my campaign from being the flavor of the week as some people call it. The difference is you got you know there's ice milk and then what I call Haagen-Dazs Black Walnut ice cream, which never loses its taste, and I could eat it seven days a week. It's called substance. If you look at what has allowed me to surge, it is because of the substance and the ideas and the specific solutions that I have put on the table more so than the other candidates. For example, I know you heard about my solutions to the economic woes that we have. Simon: Your 9-9-9 plan? Cain: The 9-9-9 plan. Now, the American people are looking for specific solutions. Simon: Well, let me ask about a couple of specific features of that plan. The 9 percent national sales tax, which would under your plan help generate revenue that would be lost by reducing payroll in corporate taxes to that matching 9 percent \u2014 a gallon of milk costs $3.89 in Iowa this week. It's $3.89 for Bill Gates and his family, $3.89 for a family that's struggling, so wouldn't a 9 percent sales tax hit families who struggle more than people who have means every time they buy a gallon of milk or gas or a loaf of bread? Cain: On a gallon of milk or a loaf of bread, Bill Gates and every rich person is going to pay the same tax as someone who's on the lower end of the spectrum. But Scott, I'm not going to play the class warfare card. You have to compare the taxes they pay today. If you pick a certain income level \u2014 and I'll pick one and walk you through it, OK? Simon: Sure. Cain: I'm going to use $50,000 a year, since that's approximately what the median income is for a family in this country. [For a] family of four, $50,000 a year. Under the current system, based upon standard deductions and standard exemptions, they're going to pay $10,200 in taxes. Under the 9-9-9 plan, the middle 9, they're going to pay $4,500. That leaves $5,700 to apply to that milk and bread in terms of the taxes. You have to go through the numbers of each individual situation. Simon: The question we have to ask this week: The Justice Department says they've been able to stop a plot to assassinate the Saudi ambassador to the United States in Washington, D.C. And they say that plan traces back to Iran. They've arraigned an Iranian-American man in the crime. Are you convinced that the government of Iran is behind the plot? Cain: Based upon the reports that I have seen, I am convinced, but obviously I, as president, would want to see all of the evidence that has caused them to come to that conclusion. Secondly, what we should do in response to that would depend upon carefully reviewing all of the information, all of the intelligence information, all of the military information, everything that we knew about that, before I could make an informed judgment as to what the United States should do. One of the reasons that I believe that this happened, Scott, is that this president is perceived is weak, and weakness invites attack. I happen to believe that that's why they attempted to do something like this to thumb their nose at the American people, to thumb that nose at the United States of America because this president is perceived as weak. Simon: Mr. Cain, I don't have to tell you that a lot of front-runners who have been in the second tier before that seem to get staggered when they get promoted to the varsity team because they get questions that \u2014 perhaps they hadn't quite thought out some of the issues and they get some sunlight, or they get some attention maybe a little bit prematurely. What's that experience been like for you this week? Cain: The reason me being in the varsity tier doesn't throw me off stride is because if you look at my career, I have been in the spotlight at various times and for various reasons. In terms of being in the spotlight, that's not new. Being in the spotlight as a presidential contender, that is new, but it's not like it's culture shock to me, it's not like I've never been in the spotlight before. I happen to think that I alone and the people I've surrounded myself with will be able to deal with being at this new level in this whole Republican presidential primary. Simon: Mr. Cain, you know from your business experience that you can have three people working behind the counter and that's just fine until the tour buses with 200 people get off and then suddenly you don't have enough staff. Do you have enough staff, enough organization, enough knowledgeable people to compete state after state from here on in? Cain: I will by the end of next week. We don't as of today, but when this surge started we started to ramp up in terms of hiring the people that we have. And since you brought up the bus, remember, my experience is different from Gov. Romney's. He's been more of a Wall Street executive. I've been a Main Street executive. I have been running that Burger King restaurant when that bus pulls up and you're understaffed. In other words, as a businessman who has worked in the trenches, you know how and when to go to the customers. And you generally find out if the customers understand the dilemma that you're in and you're doing everything that you can to service them, guess what? You will have happy customers and that's how you stay in business. I've had to do that many a time. Simon: Has more money been flowing to you this week? You know the president's recently raised $70 million this quarter. Cain: More money has been flowing into my campaign, absolutely, yes. I will tell you conservatively that the fundraising has gone up 20-fold in the last two weeks. President Obama has said he's going to raise a billion dollars to try and buy a second term. Well, to quote one of my supporters, President Obama might raise $1 billion to try to get re-elected, but the people of this country are going to raise some Cain. Simon: Mr. Cain, thanks for all your time. Cain: Thank you, Scott.",

Members of the Palmetto Statesmen, a barbershop chorus, say they think the Republican Party has lost its way. Currently, many say they favor candidate Herman Cain. One of the earliest primary states is South Carolina, which holds its primary on Jan. 21. South Carolina is a Republican stronghold \u2014 with a strongly conservative voting base. In Spartanburg,  S.C., a handful of Republican voters share what's on their minds \u2014 and many are leaning toward Herman Cain. Perry Aims To Win Voters Texas Gov. Rick Perry is trying to win hearts and minds in the Palmetto State right where it counts \u2014 with food. At a luncheon in Spartanburg Thursday, his wife, Anita, a former nurse, said she loves South Carolina: \"Ham and grits, I'm that kinda girl. I think I could live here, too.\" And she took some jabs at President Obama's record. \"Our debt is more than $14 trillion and climbing,\" she said. \"I had to look up what a trillion was.\" If you think Rick Perry is looking over his shoulder, wondering how Herman Cain stole his thunder, you get that sense from his wife, too. \"As a health care professional, when I hear 9-9-9, I wanna call 911 \u2014 because it will raise the taxes,\" she said, referring to Cain's economic plan. 'We're Bankrupt' On Tuesday night, the Spartanburg County Republican Women held their monthly meeting over dinner. Member Mary Anne Riley urged her friends to join in prayer sessions for the country. \"Look, we really need help here \u2014 and sometimes it's nice to get together, maybe a breakfast. You can sit there, you can say prayers and maybe have a cup of coffee or something like that,\" Riley said. Group treasurer Jane Johnson said she thinks the country is in \"big trouble.\" I hate to say this \u2013 it's a shame that Bachmann is not a man. It'd be completely different. Because I think that the politics would respect her more than that. And that's just the natural thing, the way it is. Robert E. Lee, lead singer with the Palmetto Statesmen Barbershop Chorus \"We're bankrupt, economically, morally, ethically,\" she said. \"I mean just turn the TV on and see what has happened to our civilization. And just as God protected the Israelites \u2014 I think he can either protect this country or he can destroy this country.\" As for the Republican candidates, Johnson said she knows and likes Newt Gingrich. She said she thinks he's intelligent and doesn't put up with nonsense.  Her second favorite is Herman Cain \u2014 she thinks Washington needs a good businessperson. \"Perry bothers me, just a gut-level feeling I guess,\" Johnson said. \"Romney is maybe not as conservative as I'd like for him to be.\" At a gathering of the Spartanburg Chamber of Commerce, Donna Simpson said she admires Herman Cain's plain-spokenness, practicality and business experience. Simpson does marketing and PR for an assisted living center. She's deeply disturbed by the health care overhaul and what it means for business. \"I've attended some seminars where supposed experts from maybe Medicare and different organization have come to speak,\" she said. \"And they've just thrown their hands up and said, 'Who knows? We can't give you any direction probably more so than you already know right now because we really don't know what's coming down the pike.' So it's just left everyone in a bad state.\" A Faith-Based Decision At a rehearsal of the Palmetto Statesmen Barbershop Chorus, Robert E. Lee, who sings lead, said religion and politics go hand in hand. \"You're in the South down here, where you're in the Bible Belt. They say don't get religion into politics,\" he said. \"That's like sayin' don't get our lives into it, because that's who we are and what we are.\" Lee and some of the other singers sat down to chat. All of them are engineers and all but one is retired.  They all vote Republican. Jon Bane said he thinks his party has a problem with electability. \"Any party that would nominate John McCain to run for the president has got a problem,\" Bane said. \"We don't pick our best candidates. Let's face it, we do not.\" Martin Hill said there isn't one candidate that he favors. \"There is at this point really no candidate that just stands out for me \u2014 Herman Cain probably comes the closest,\" he said. He did say he has trouble with Mitt Romney. \"The issue of him being a Mormon is not so much to me as it is just knowing what he's done as governor of Massachusetts,\" he said. \"Health care is one in particular.\" Hill went on to say he'd prefer to see a Christian in the White House. And Lee jumped in to follow up on that. \"I think you hear down here talking about a Christian, you're talking about those that follow the Nicene Creed,\" he said. \"And the Mormons do not follow the Nicene Creed.\" Lee said he's a big fan of Michele Bachmann. \"I hate to say this \u2014 it's a shame that Bachmann is not a man. It'd be completely different,\" he said. \"Because I think that the politics would respect her more than that. And that's just the natural thing, the way it is, and I hate to see it.\" So Lee is focusing on Herman Cain. \"I believe he's a faith-based person,\" Lee said. \"And I especially like his 9-9-9. I do. I like it clean-cut. You pay 9. You pay 9. You pay your 9.\" These men agree that the Republicans in power have lost their way. They've been fiscally irresponsible \u2014 not conservative enough. \"Look, there are plenty of Republicans in Congress that could have long since stood up and done something about the circumstances we find ourselves in now,\" Hill said. \"So I don't think it's fair to blame the Democrats necessarily for the situation.\" Said Lee: \"As we say down South, 'Amen brother.' \"",

            "article_content": " Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich makes a point during the presidential debate sponsored at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire, Tuesday night.  Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich makes a point during the presidential debate sponsored at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire, Tuesday night. At last  night's GOP presidential debate in New Hampshire, Newt Gingrich condemned the  government's latest effort to discourage men from routinely getting blood  tests for prostate cancer by citing the views of Dr. Andrew von Eschenbach. Gingrich stressed some of von Eschenbach's prestigious bona fides, including  heading the National Cancer Institute and practicing at one of the country's  major cancer centers. But  Gingrich didn't mention some other aspects of von Eschenbach's background, including  his belief that \"the suffering and death due to cancer\" could be eliminated as early as  2015, as well as his affiliation with one of Gingrich's think tanks and a think  tank of a major proponent of the PSA blood test. First,  here's what Gingrich said  at the debate in response to a question about wasteful spending in  Medicare: I am  really glad you asked that, because I was just swapping e-mails today with Andy  von Eschenbach, who was the head of the National Cancer Institute, the head of  the Food and Drug Administration. But before that, he was the provost at M.D.  Anderson, the largest cancer treatment center in the world. And he wrote me to  point out that the most recent U.S. government intervention on whether or not to  have prostate testing is basically going to kill people. So, if you ask me, do I  want some Washington bureaucrat to create a class action decision which affects  every American's last two years of life, not ever. I think  it is a disaster. I think, candidly, Gov. Palin got attacked unfairly for  describing what would, in effect, be death panels. And  what von Eschenbach will tell you if you call him is, the decision to suggest  that we not test men with PSA will mean that a number of people who do not have  \u2014 who are susceptible to a very rapid prostate cancer will die  unnecessarily. But  Paul Goldberg, publisher of The Cancer  Letter, a weekly newsletter that chronicled von Eschenbach's tenure at NCI, disputed  the notion that he should be viewed as a go-to source on the value of cancer screening tests,  such as the PSA. \"I  wouldn't call him an expert in prevention,\"  Goldberg said. He said Gingrich's laudatory praise of von Eschenbach was  \"eminence-based medicine,\" not \"evidence-based medicine.\" In any event, von Eschenbach is a senior advisor for Gingrich's think tank,  the Center for Health Transformation. He's also a senior fellow with the Milken Institute, whose  founder, Michael Milken, credits the blood test with saving his  life. We weren't able to reach von Eschenbach for a comment. We called Gingrich's campaign headquarters, but a  campaign worker said they didn't have his contact information. Oh, and  the \"death panel\" claim about the law? That has consistently  been debunked as false.",

Bill and PolitiFact staff writer Angie Drobnic Holan wrote about their conclusions for PolitiFact.com and It's All Politics: The economy was the main topic at the Republican presidential debate at Dartmouth College. And the debate began with several candidates agreeing on a big cause of the economic crisis: the government. Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney said that in the early 1960s, all levels of government were  \"consuming about 27 percent of the U.S. economy,\" a number that has  risen to 37 percent today. With that trendline, he said, \"we cease at some point  to be a free economy.\" Romney was close to right on the percentages. But the  U.S. economy is still considered free by conservative groups that create  measures of economic freedom. We rated Romney's statement Mostly False. Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann put the blame on federal requirements about  mortgages. We checked similar claims about the financial crisis in 2008  when Sen. John McCain blamed the crisis on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.  We rated those claims Half True. Bachmann also said that \"15 political appointees will make all the  major health care decisions for over 300 million Americans.\" The  appointees she's talking about will look for ways to reduce costs for  Medicare, the government health insurance program for people over age  65. We rated her statement False. Former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman said, \"I created a flat tax in the state  of Utah. It took that state to the No. 1 position in terms of job  creation.\" He created a flatter tax \u2014 not a pure flat tax \u2014 and Utah  did experience job growth. But it wasn't No. 1, and the causation was  questionable. We rated his statement Half True. Texas Gov. Rick Perry said he switched from the Democratic  Party to the Republican Party at younger age than President Ronald Reagan did. We've  rated that True. Bachmann, to make her point that the government spends too much, said  the U.S. borrows 40 cents for every dollar it takes in. We've rated that  True.",

Though some Republican voters have doubts about Perry, recent polls show it's not because of his stance on Social Security, which he's called a \"Ponzi scheme.\"\n                \n                    \n                    Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption It's often been called the \"third rail\" of American politics. If so, many of those running for office this political season are living dangerously. Social Security \u2014 what's wrong with it and how to fix it \u2014 has become part of the political debate in the presidential primary season. Most candidates say they have plans to reform it, but Texas Gov. Rick Perry has gone further, saying that Social Security is a \"Ponzi scheme\" and a \"monstrous lie.\" Although Perry may be running into resistance from Republican voters, it's not because of his stand on Social Security. 'What's Wrong With Calling It A Ponzi Scheme?' In recent debates, moderators have asked Perry to defend his tough views on Social Security. In his book Fed Up! Perry calls the program used by nearly 55 million Americans \"a crumbling monument to the failure of the New Deal.\" He says it's part of the nation's march toward socialism, something Americans have been forced to accept for more than 70 years \"at the expense of respect for the Constitution.\" At last week's debate in Orlando, Fla., Perry tried to distance himself from some of those comments. His leading rival, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, called him on it. \"There's a Rick Perry out there that's saying that ... the federal government shouldn't be in the pension business, that it's unconstitutional \u2014 unconstitutional \u2014 and it should be returned to the states,\" Romney said. \"So you better find that Rick Perry and get him to stop saying that.\" Perry says he never intended to suggest that the federal Social Security program should be scrapped and given over to the states. But he hastened in that debate, and in other speeches, to reassure voters. Texas Gov. Rick Perry gives a kiss to 100-year-old Mary Canfield during the Blackhawk County Republican annual Lincoln Day Dinner last month in Waterloo, Iowa. Perry has sought to reassure voters that he won't scrap Social Security.\n                \n                    \n                    Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Texas Gov. Rick Perry gives a kiss to 100-year-old Mary Canfield during the Blackhawk County Republican annual Lincoln Day Dinner last month in Waterloo, Iowa. Perry has sought to reassure voters that he won't scrap Social Security. \"Well, let me just say first, for those people that are on Social Security today, for those people that are approaching Social Security, they don't have anything in the world to worry about,\" Perry said. \"We have made a solemn oath to the people of this country that that Social Security program in place today will be there for them.\" Some Republicans have begun to question Perry's conservative credentials because of his support of a Texas law extending in-state tuition rates to children of illegal immigrants. But some Republican activists who heard Perry's comments say they weren't bothered by his harsh characterization of Social Security. Diane Warren, a retiree from Apopka, Fla., asked: What's wrong with calling it a Ponzi scheme? \"Isn't a Ponzi scheme where you put in money now, and then you will get paid back later on somebody else's money?\" Warren was one of 3,500 Republican activists at a state party event last week for a presidential debate and straw poll. She said that with this group, tough talk on Social Security is no longer off limits. \"The seniors in our day and age are not the seniors from the '70s, '80s, '90s. We're more aware, we're involved.  And the Tea Party was a big part of that,\" she said. In Florida, Republicans Are 'In One Camp' Warren's comments don't come as a surprise to Peter Brown. He helps direct the Quinnipiac University poll, which recently surveyed Floridians to get their reaction to Perry's comments. \"A majority of voters overall say it's not fair \u2014 that the idea of Social Security as a Ponzi scheme does not jibe with their view,\" he says. \"But a majority of Republicans say that it does.\" Among a cross-section of Florida voters \u2014 Republicans, Democrats and independents \u2014 Brown says about as many people think Perry wants to end Social Security as fix it. \"But Florida Republicans are very much in one camp,\" Brown says. \"By 4 to 1, they think he wants to fix it, not end it. And obviously, that's helpful data when he's running for the Republican presidential nomination.\" One of the state's leading Republicans, House Speaker Dean Cannon, is helping run Perry's campaign in Florida. \"I don't think [Social Security] is a third rail anymore,\" he says. Cannon points to Republican Marco Rubio's Senate win last year over independent Charlie Crist and Democrat Kendrick Meek. Crist ran ads attacking Rubio for wanting to raise the Social Security retirement age and consider cutting benefits. Rubio won easily. In that context, Cannon says calling Social Security a Ponzi scheme hardly registers with Florida voters. \"The benefits that are there for the people who are about to retire or even close to it are absolutely an inviolate trust of the American people,\" he says. \"But we've got to be honest about changing it.\" That may be the case in the primary, but many Republicans are still nervous about how Social Security will play in the general election. One in five Floridians receives Social Security, and the issue may help determine how the eventual Republican nominee does here. Bill Donegan, a Republican official from the Orlando area, says that in Florida politics, the history is clear. \"Any time you deal with Social Security, or you deal with Medicare or Medicaid,\" he says, \"you better be real sure how you word it.\" That's because positions and issues that work for you in the primary can be used against you in the general election.",

Obama laid out a plan for trillions in deficit cuts but warned Republicans he will veto any bill that makes structural changes to Medicare unless they agree to additional revenues. There's been a sea change at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. It's almost as if the cerebral, detached president went into a phone booth and came out a fighting Democrat. In the Rose Garden on Monday, as President Obama laid out his vision for how the congressional supercommittee could find trillions in savings, he was no longer above the fray. He was right in the fray. And he made it clear he has given up on his so far fruitless search for common ground with the Republicans. He did something he's never done before when sending a proposal to Congress: He made a veto threat upfront. \"I will not support any plan that puts all the burden for closing our deficit on ordinary Americans,\" he said. \"And I will veto any bill that changes benefits for those who rely on Medicare but does not raise serious revenues by asking the wealthiest Americans or biggest corporations to pay their fair share.\" The president planted a flag with a quid pro quo: no structural changes in Medicare unless Republicans agree to additional revenues. It is fine to be a conciliator, and it is important not to be mindlessly partisan ... but at the end of the day, the threshold quality that people associate with president is leader. And that's what Barack Obama, I think, is in the process of re-establishing for people. Democratic strategist Geoff Garin But House Speaker John Boehner also planted a flag \u2014 with no quid pro quo. Boehner ruled out any increase in tax revenues. So that leaves the chances for a grand bargain from the deficit supercommittee around zilch. But, says Democratic strategist Geoff Garin, cutting the deficit was only one of the president's goals. \"The presidency is a leadership position. People want the president to lead at the end of the day. It is fine to be a conciliator, and it is important not to be mindlessly partisan ... but at the end of the day, the threshold quality that people associate with president is leader,\" Garin says. \"And that's what Barack Obama, I think, is in the process of re-establishing for people.\" Questions About Leadership \"Re-establishing,\" Garin says, because it is a threshold attribute that independent voters \u2014 and even Democrats \u2014 had begun to doubt. \"What the American people had started to question is whether Barack Obama had the strong leadership and the courage of conviction to lay out a course and stick with it,\" he says. Garin says the president's recent combative speeches have helped. Jim Kessler of the centrist think tank Third Way points to something else: When he polled swing voters, Kessler found what White House aides will often point out \u2014 that the president is still personally popular. \"What we found in our poll was ... they're open to this guy. They still like him and they mostly want him to succeed,\" Kessler says. \"There's still a fondness for him.\" That may be true, but Republicans have been quick to turn this bright spot for Obama into a backhanded compliment that underscores their main argument. \"This president is a nice guy,\" former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney said in a GOP debate earlier this month. \"He doesn't have a clue how to get this country working again.\" Changing The Discussion He's got to make it a choice between his vision \u2014 what he hopes to accomplish, what he thinks he's started to accomplish \u2014 and where the Republicans want to take the country. That is the only way he can be re-elected. Political analyst Stu Rothenberg A book released Tuesday about the Obama White House, Confidence Men, by journalist Ron Suskind, underscores that \"in over his head\" narrative. In Kessler's polling, one of the words most often volunteered by swing voters to describe the president was \"ineffective.\" And that raises the question \u2014 with no ability to get a divided Congress to pass his agenda, how can the president convince voters he is an effective leader? \"Of course you want to see the economy improve and you'd like to see a deficit package come through,\" Kessler says, \"but they have to come up with a formulation that says: 'Well, if the economy is still sputtering along and Congress isn't able to pass anything, let us at least show strength.' \" According to most forecasters, the economy probably will still be sputtering along next year.  Political analyst Stu Rothenberg says Obama is running for a second term in one of the worst environments for an incumbent. \"He cannot allow the 2012 election to be a referendum on the state of the country, the state of the economy,\" Rothenberg says. \"He's got to make it a choice between his vision \u2014 what he hopes to accomplish, what he thinks he's started to accomplish \u2014 and where the Republicans want to take the country. That is the only way he can be re-elected.\" Obama made history once. To get a second term, he'll have to make it again. Not only does he have 9 percent unemployment to contend with \u2014 no president since Franklin Roosevelt has ever run for re-election with the jobless rate that high \u2014 but consumer confidence about the future is at its lowest level since 1980 and 1992. And those were both years when incumbent presidents were defeated.",

            "article_content": "This week brought another slew of bad political news for President Obama. The Democrats lost two special elections: one in a Republican-leaning district in Nevada, and one in a Democratic stronghold in New   York. There are also new polls showing the president's support weakening among Democratic voters in blue states.

The traditionally Democratic and Jewish district elected Turner, revealing the problems Obama may have with political strongholds in the 2012 election. Sometimes off-cycle elections are good predictors of the trends in the next national election, and sometimes they're not. But Tuesday's rout in the heavily Democratic and heavily Jewish 9th congressional district of New York sent a wave of gloom through the Democratic Party. A Turning Tide For Obama's Jewish Voters? Matt Brooks of the Republican Jewish Coalition says the results suggest that Obama will have trouble with Jewish voters next year in battleground states like Ohio, Pennsylvania and Florida. \"An overwhelming number of Jews \u2014 reform Jews, conservative Jews, Orthodox Jews \u2014 crossed over and voted for the Republican, because [of], in large part, the concerns that they have with the Obama administration's position on Israel,\" Brooks says. \"I think it's very telling.\" Democrats say New   York's 9th is unique because there's no other district in the country with as many conservative Orthodox Jews. Like other observant religious people, they've been drifting to the GOP for a while. Democrats also say Jews are still one of the most loyal Democratic voting blocs, but they're not as loyal as they used to be. Jewish voters went 80 percent for President Obama in 2008, down from 90 percent for Bill Clinton. Political analyst Stuart Rothenberg says President Obama does have a Jewish problem. \"The president's problem is that too many Jews think that his support [of Israel] is kind of formal, but half-hearted. They really don't trust him, and that is a significant problem,\" Rothenberg says. Some of this is specific to the Jewish community, but a lot of it is a more general softening of Democratic support for the president. Stuart Rothenberg, a political analyst It's a significant issue not because Jews make up a large voting bloc, but because they are disproportionately Democratic activists and fundraisers. The White House is well aware of this problem; it's doing outreach to Jewish groups to make the point that press secretary Jay Carney made Thursday. \"As recently as last week or the week before, the prime minister of Israel made an incredibly strong statement about the remarkable commitment \u2014 unshakable commitment \u2014 that this president has to Israel's security, and the unprecedented assistance that this president has provided Israel,\" Carney said. An Overall Decline In Support Rothenberg and others say it would be a big mistake to look at the New York results solely as a reflection of the president's problems with Jewish voters. \"Some of this is specific to the Jewish community, but a lot of it is a more general softening of Democratic support for the president,\" he says. That's a much more serious problem, says Mitchell Moss, an expert on urban politics at New   York University who followed the special election won by Republican Bob Turner. Moss explains that the Turner people put out a mailer showing President Obama on a golf course with a headline that read: \"Washington Just Doesn't Get It.\" \"Nationalizing the race turned out to be an effective way to basically take a Democratic seat and make it a Republican seat,\" Moss says. It's the kind of attack Republicans will use everywhere next year \u2014 with all kinds of voters \u2014 against the Democrats and President Obama. \"He has fundamental problems, because the employment problems of this country have not been solved, and he doesn't look like he understands how to solve them,\" Moss says. \"I don't think this is about Israel; this is about the economy.\" The Democrats are in trouble. I think it tells you that there's a lot more in the 2012 electoral map that is contestable than people realize. Mitchell Moss, an urban politics expert Even among Jewish voters in New  York's 9th congressional district, polls showed that the economy, Social Security and Medicare were more important than Israel. And that, says Moss, is the real takeaway for Obama. \"The Democrats are in trouble,\" he says. \"I think it tells you that there's a lot more in the 2012 electoral map that is contestable than people realize.\" New polls from blue states highlight the problem the president is facing among people who should be his most reliable supporters. In California, Obama's approval rating is down to 50 percent, and a poll in New York shows him with only 45 percent approval. These are dismal numbers for a president who needs the enthusiastic support of Democratic voters in every state.",

Rick Perry during a break in a Republican debate Monday in Tampa, Fla.\n                \n                    \n                    Mike Carlson/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Texas Gov. Rick Perry says he wants to be honest with the American people. That now involves attempts to shelve the part of his presidential campaign playbook that had him just last week vigorously dismissing Social Security as a \"Ponzi scheme.\" Good luck on changing that conversation, Republican presidential frontrunner Perry, what with seven opponents nipping at your heels. The difficulty that Perry, and the party, face in trying to extricate their fortunes from his position on the 76-year-old program was on full display during Monday night's Tea Party-sponsored GOP presidential debate in Florida. When former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney pressed Perry on assertions in his recent book that the program benefiting more than 52 million old and disabled Americans is \"unconstitutional,\" the Texas governor insisted that he had no intentions of taking away an entitlement he once referred to as a \"monstrosity.\" Romney took a few hits of his own for writing in his own recent book that a requirement that the program invest its surplus in U.S. Treasury securities is tantamount to defrauding Americans. It may be troubling to the party, but it's no mystery how its presidential conversation, occurring in the midst of an economic crisis, became mired in bickering over a popular program that is projected to remain solvent until 2036. When the leading presidential candidate has a record of incendiary comments about an entrenched program that not even Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI) would touch in his controversial House budget plan, it's catnip to opponents. Particularly when a recent Pew Research Center survey found that 87 percent of Republicans (and 85 percent of independents) believe that Social Security \"has been very good/good for the country.\" Perry's historic take on the program has become such a problem for his nascent but rocket-like candidacy that he took to the opinion pages of USA Today before Monday's debate to insist that he wants to fix the monstrosity. Though he didn't use that word. He also avoided \"Ponzi scheme.\" That Perry took that moderating tack in advance of a debate sponsored by small-government Tea Party enthusiasts, a number of whom in the past have called for abolishing Social Security, leaves little question as to the backlash he and the party are facing on the issue. It's not that voters out there are blind to future funding issues the program faces. The Pew Center found that a majority of high-earning Republicans and those who identify with the Tea Party movement favor \"reducing the federal budget\" over keeping Social Security and Medicare benefits as is. So, where does the program stand? Is it \"on its last legs,\" as GOP candidate Ron Paul, a Texas congressman, suggested during Monday's debate? Craig Copeland, a senior research associate at the non-partisan Employee Benefits Research Institute, says funding fixes are needed. And the Trustees of the Social Security and Medicare trust funds say that the financial conditions of both \"remain challenging.\" Last year, the trustees reported, was the first since 1983 that Social Security's expenditures exceeded its \"non-interest income.\" That means the program has to begin redeeming its trust fund assets from the Treasury's general fund \u2014 to the tune of about $5 billion \u2014 in 2012, Copeland says. The trust fund is projected to be depleted in 2036, drained by a weakened economy and big aging population, if the program is left unchanged. \"Just because the trust fund is depleted, doesn't mean the program will end,\" Copeland says. \"Without changes to the program, it could still go forward, paying out 75 percent\" of what the legislation has required, he adds. \"The payroll tax still exists,\" he says. \"It will still be a typical pay-as-you-go system.\" The program's trustees this year called for \"legislative modifications if disruptive consequences for beneficiaries and taxpayers are to be avoided.\" Copeland says, for example, that a two-percentage-point increase now in Social Security taxes has been projected to cover the program fully for another 75 years. Ponzi scheme? Not so much, he says. \"A Ponzi scheme doesn't have the ability to tax the next group of participants,\" he says, \"or to force them to be participants.\" \"In the case of Social Security, there is money coming in every year, and, by law, people can't stop contributing,\" Copeland says. It is with keen interest that voters, politicians and influential Republicans will be watching another Republican presidential debate on tap next week. And just where Perry, and his opponents, take the Social Security issue just over three months out from the start of presidential primary-and-caucus season. As he was pressed Monday by Romney about whether he still believes Social Security should be ended as a federal program, Perry responded: \"I think we ought to have a conversation.\" Romney, mastering the obvious, replied: \"We're having that right now, governor.\" Whether the party likes it or not.",

Here are  a few numbers: 88: Years since  a Republican (Andrew Petersen) held the House seat 39: Percentage  of votes won by Robert Turner in the 2010 primary election against Weiner 660,306: Population  in 2010 40.3: Median age 70: Percentage of  residents who live in Queens 16.5 percent: Blue collar $57,  449: Median income 57: Percentage \u2014 white 17.2: Percentage \u2014  Hispanic 18.6: Percentage \u2014  Asian 111,237: Votes for Barack Obama in the 2008  presidential election 88,307: Votes for  John McCain in the 2008 presidential election 36.6: Percentage  of population with a college degree Source:  Almanac of American Politics, 2012 -- Tasnim Shamma With  just days to go before a special election, a Siena College poll taken this week showed the Republican candidate with a 6-point advantage in a heavily Democratic district. If Democrats were thinking their nominee, David Weprin, would coast to an easy victory in a district where they hold a 3-to-1 registration advantage, they aren't now. This week, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee reportedly poured nearly half a million dollars into a TV ad attacking Weprin's opponent, Republican Bob Turner. The first version of the ad was pulled from YouTube because it included an image of a corporate jet flying over the New York skyline, which struck some as offensive because of the impending anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Queens native Douglas Muzzio, who teaches public affairs at  Baruch College, said Weprin has hurt himself with some other prominent  gaffes. For example, telling the New York Daily News editorial  board that the national debt is $4 trillion, instead of $14  trillion. Queens Assemblyman David Weprin was handpicked by Democratic leaders as their choice to replace Weiner.\n                \n                    \n                    Ken Goldfield/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Queens Assemblyman David Weprin was handpicked by Democratic leaders as their choice to replace Weiner. \"Weprin's got a money advantage. He's got an organizational advantage,\" Muzzio said. \"He should win easily. But given the times, and his less than stellar performance in the race so far, it's tight.\" The two candidates debated Thursday on local TV, sparring over who is a bigger supporter of the state of Israel and who has a better plan to cut the federal deficit. Weprin said the way to cut the federal deficit is to close corporate loopholes and eliminate tax benefits for multinational corporations that export jobs overseas. A state assemblyman who was handpicked by New York's Democratic leaders to fill Weiner's seat, Weprin has had his hands full with Turner, his Republican opponent. Turner is a fiscal conservative and a former cable TV executive who helped create the tabloid talk program The Jerry Springer Show. He ran in the district last year and lost to Weiner by more than 20 points. But he's had a lot more success this year framing the race as a referendum on President Obama. Republican candidate Bob Turner lost a race against Weiner last year. This time he's framing the race as a referendum on President Obama.\n                \n                    \n                    Publicity photo\n                    \n                \nhide caption \"This is a chance for the voters to stand up and say, 'Mr. Obama, we're not going to take it,' \" Turner said. \"And this is one way they will clearly understand.\" Even Weprin tried to distance himself from some of the president's less popular policies. At the debate in Queens, he hesitated for a moment before saying that he would support Obama's re-election, eliciting a mix of cheers and boos from the crowd. Margaret Wagner of Broad Channel, Queens, was one of the audience members who booed. Wagner says she voted for Weiner in the past but plans to vote Republican this year. \"I'm a little concerned with where the country is going,\" Wagner said. \"You know, I am responsible for my own budget, and I'd love to see the country be responsible. And they're not.\" Turnout for Tuesday's special election is expected to be low. That would seem to favor Democrats, who traditionally have a better get-out-the-vote effort in Queens and Brooklyn. And Weprin is turning to popular New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo for help on the campaign trail in the closing days. No matter which party wins on Tuesday, it may not the hold the seat for long. New York state is set to lose two congressional seats next year \u2014 and most observers think this will be one of them.",

Rick Perry (left) shakes hands with a supporter as he goes onstage at the Polk County GOP summer picnic event held at the Iowa State Fairgrounds in Des Moines on Saturday.\n                \n                    \n                    Nati Harnik/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Republican presidential hopeful Texas Gov. Rick Perry (left) shakes hands with a supporter as he goes onstage at the Polk County GOP summer picnic event held at the Iowa State Fairgrounds in Des Moines on Saturday. When Texas Gov. Rick Perry was asked about Social Security during a campaign stop in Ottumwa, Iowa, last weekend, he didn't mince words. He suggested that younger workers who are required to pay into the retirement system are the victims of a government swindle. \"We need to have a conversation with America, just like we're having right here today, and admit that is a Ponzi scheme for these young people,\" Perry said. \"The idea that they're working and paying into Social Security today, the current program, that it's going to be there for them, is a lie.\" Perry used similar \"Ponzi scheme\" language to describe Social Security in Fed Up, the book he wrote last year. A campaign spokesman tried to soft-pedal that view in an interview with the Wall Street Journal this month, noting that the book was written before Perry decided to run for president, and saying it doesn't reflect the governor's current views. But Perry himself made no such distinction at a weekend appearance in Des Moines. \"I haven't backed off anything in my book. So read the book again and get it right,\" he said. Social Security does share one important feature of a Ponzi scheme.  The money that today's workers pay into the system goes right back out the door to pay current beneficiaries.  That hasn't been a problem for the system so far, but the future presents a challenge. Retirees tend to live a lot longer now than they did in the 1930s. And as Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA) told CBS, there are now fewer workers paying into the system for every retiree taking out. \"Part of this is just math. [There are] 16 workers for every one retiree 40 years ago; 3 workers for every retiree now,\" Warner said. Warner is part of a bipartisan group of U.S. senators known as the \"Gang of Six\" who proposed adjustments to Social Security's tax and benefit formula in an effort to shore up its long-term finances. Perry suggested similar tweaks during this weekend's appearance in Iowa. \"We need to decide \u2014 are we going to raise the age of eligibility?  What's that age going to be that we're going to make the transformation from? And literally have this good, thoughtful conversation about the program and what we really want that program to be,\" Perry said. In his book, however, Perry hints at more radical changes, suggesting that Social Security is unconstitutional and arguing that Americans would be better off with private pensions. He acknowledged that it is a politically risky position, but maybe not as risky as it once was. Social Security And Young Voters University of South Florida political analyst Susan McManus notes that, even in the graying sunshine state, nearly half of the voters are now younger than 50. And she says many of them don't believe they'll be getting Social Security. \"It used to be in Florida, you didn't dare come in here and say anything negative about Social Security or Medicare,\" McManus says. \"Now, of course, with the changing age demographic, it seems politicians that are willing to say something about Social Security's possible problems down the way may just get the attention of some of these younger voters.\" But defenders say fears about Social Security's long-range finances are exaggerated. \"The reason younger Americans do not believe it will be there is there's been a drumbeat of people like Gov. Perry and others who've been saying for many years the system doesn't work,\" says Eric Kingson, co-director of the Strengthen Social Security campaign. \"It's not going to be there. The fact is Social Security is quite sustainable [and] it requires very modest adjustments.\" Indeed, the latest trustees' report says that even without any changes, Social Security could keep paying all of its bills for the next 25 years and fully three-quarters of what retirees expect after that. Kingson suspects Perry's real aim is to dismantle the program and discredit the politics of its creation. In his book, Perry calls Social Security a \"a crumbling monument to the failure of the New Deal.\" \"I think Gov. Perry has never seen a federal program that he likes very much,\" Kingson says. \"He basically believes in a very small government. He believes in states' rights [and] he's very clear about that.\" Kingson says that it is a position that should be openly discussed in a campaign, but it should be discussed without \"specious analogies\" like \"Ponzi scheme.\" It seems that the national conversation that Perry said he wanted on Social Security is under way.",

            "article_content": "Mitt Romney speaks during a town hall meeting in Keene, N.H., on Aug. 24.\n                \n                    \n                    Jim Cole/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Mitt Romney speaks during a town hall meeting in Keene, N.H., on Aug. 24. Mitt Romney's front-runner status in the race for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination took a hit this week, with national polls showing that he has been eclipsed by Texas Gov. Rick Perry. Perry's quick ascent \u2014 he officially announced his candidacy only two weeks ago \u2014 has put pressure on the former Massachusetts governor and venture capitalist to tweak his consistent I'm-the-CEO-you've-been-waiting-for campaign theme. But, for better or worse, race-watchers say, Romney's success in the private sector remains his most persuasive argument for why he, and not Perry or the rest of the lagging GOP field, should be the Republican who takes on President Obama next year. \"His accomplishment with Bain Capital and with helping turn around the Salt Lake City Olympics in 2002 are the primary strengths of his candidacy,\" says Dale Buss, who has written extensively about business leaders and CEO politicians. \"Given the deteriorating state of the economy, a lot of Americans are looking for economic competence, for economic understanding,\" Buss says. That includes former Obama supporter Mort Zuckerman, the billionaire real estate developer and publisher, who this week bemoaned what he characterized as an economic \"competency crisis\" in the White House. In a Wall Street Journal opinion piece on Thursday, Zuckerman said he longs for a \"triple-A president to run a triple-A country,\" though he did not mention Romney. Given the deteriorating state of the economy, a lot of Americans are looking for economic competence, for economic understanding. Dale Buss Strategists say that if Romney veers from his CEO message to try to move to the right of the  conservative Perry, an evangelical Christian and Tea Party favorite, he risks muddying the argument that he is uniquely qualified to lead during a time of national economic crisis. Because Romney's moderate past on legal abortion, gay rights, gun control and expanding health care coverage already makes him a suspect commodity with the party's base, his best bet is to stay the business leader course. Romney, however, is discovering that his CEO personality and corporate success, including personal wealth estimated at $250 million, can present on-the-trail pitfalls and fodder for his opposition, especially in a general election. Democrats pounced on his Iowa State Fair comment that \"corporations are people.\" He had to weather recent reports that he plans to tear down his $12 million California beach home to build a much larger one. He dismissed with a \"no harm, no foul\" comment criticisms of a secretive and short-lived political action group, founded by a former Bain colleague, that gave his campaign $1 million. And this week, while in New Hampshire, he shushed an aggressive questioner by saying, \"You're not the boss of me.\" Nature Of The Business CEO politicians like Romney, says J.P. Donlon, all have the \"instinct and drive to accomplish things.\" GOP hopeful Mitt Romney met with business leaders in Claremont, N.H., on Aug. 24.\n                \n                    \n                    Jim Cole/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption GOP hopeful Mitt Romney met with business leaders in Claremont, N.H., on Aug. 24. \"But when you're running a corporation, everyone by definition is to be pulling in the same direction,\" says Donlon, editor-in-chief of Chief Executive magazine. \"In politics, you have to have the patience to deal with all the conceits that politicians have to undergo and suffer through.\" \"Why do you think Jack Welch and Lee Iacocca didn't run?\" he said, referring, respectively, to the former heads of General Electric and Chrysler who were both urged to seek political office. \"Mitt Romney, however, has already dealt with these issues for a number of campaign seasons,\" says Donlon. Romney-watchers like to refer to the candidate this time around as Romney 2.0, a CEO who has learned from his political experiences \u2014 a successful run for governor in 2002 and his unsuccessful campaign for the GOP presidential nomination four years ago. Romney founded Bain Capital with two associates in 1984. It now has nearly 400 employees, 10 offices including those in Hong Kong, Mumbai and London, and boasts that it is \"one of the world's leading private, alternative asset management firms\" managing about $65 billion. Romney left Bain in 1999 to head the Salt Lake City Olympic Games Organizing committee. Romney has been credited with rescuing the scandal-plagued Olympics, which, once mired in graft and disarray, ended up a success. In an interview with The New York Times during his last presidential run, Romney characterized the experience as preparing him for public life.  \"Romney understands the basics of growth \u2014 private investment and capital formation,\" Donlon says. \"That's what it's all about.\" It's clear why Romney is running as a CEO, Donlon said: \"What's most important to the country right now is to create an environment that creates jobs. As long as jobs remain the single greatest priority, he's obviously going to leverage his experience in getting the nomination.\" While there have been successful CEO candidates, like three-term New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, there are plenty of examples of those who have come up short \u2014 even when money was no object. Former eBay chief Meg Whitman lost her GOP bid for governor in California last year, and ex-Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina fell short in her effort to oust California Sen. Barbara Boxer, a Democrat. Former Goldman Sachs CEO Jon Corzine, a New Jersey Democrat, won a term in the U.S. Senate and another as governor but was ousted last year by Republican Chris Christie. Perry Peril Perry has benefited, Buss says, from leading a business-friendly state but \"has not had really any experience in the private sector.\" One-third of jobs created nationally since 2009 have been in Texas, driven, many analysts say, by the state's oil and gas boom. Another analysis this week by the San Antonio Express-News found that government has also played a significant role in job growth in Texas, noting that 1 of every 4 jobs created since Perry became governor has been in the government sector \u2014 a stat that Perry's opponents are hoping might not go over well with small-government GOP voters. Romney's trick as the Republican primary season approaches, Buss says, will be to rely on his business credentials while \"tapping into what people are feeling about government spending \u2014 that seems to be more on their minds than antipathy toward Wall Street.\" And he has to do a better job of it. \"I just don't hear him packaging what he's done [in a way] that would speak to people about the experience he brings,\" Buss says. \"The conversation between CEOs and the government is getting increasingly important and visible.\" On Thursday in New Hampshire, Romney attempted to sharpen his message, saying he would give Obama a \"triple D\" rating on the economy. Former Bush administration adviser David Frum this week suggested on his website that despite Perry's surge in the national horse race polls, the Texas governor's lead is fragile, and the candidate vulnerable. National polls before the primary season often have limited long-term predictive value. In June 2007, Hillary Clinton held a \"solid lead\" over Obama and former North Carolina Sen. John Edwards in the race for the Democratic nomination, and Rudolph Giuliani still led on the GOP side. Giuliani eventually dropped out of the race after failing to win any primary contests. In Perry's case, Frum says, his opposition to Social Security and Medicare could pose problems. In his book, Fed Up! published last fall, Perry posits that Social Security is unconstitutional, a \"Ponzi scheme,\" and a failure. Last week Perry's communications director said he'd never heard Perry call Social Security unconstitutional and said that the book should not be viewed \"in any way as a 2012 campaign blueprint or manifesto.\" Perry's vulnerabilities, Frum asserts, \"will come under intense scrutiny during his stint in the spotlight.\" And that could play to Romney's advantage, if he continues to double down on his economic bona fides. Says Buss: \"It's still his to lose.\"",

            "article_content": "Former Mass. Gov. Mitt Romney has been meeting with voters in New Hampshire. At this week's town hall sessions, he's faced tough questions about climate change and the future of Medicare and Social Security. Romney downplayed new polls showing he is no longer the GOP presidential frontrunner, thanks to a surge by new candidate Texas Gov. Rick Perry.  RENEE MONTAGNE, Host: Romney has been campaigning hard in New Hampshire this week, and NPR's Don Gonyea has been following him from town to town. DON GONYEA: If you're going to get bad news in the form of a sudden change in the polls, then it's best to get it on friendly turf, and that's what New Hampshire is for Mitt Romney. At a town hall in the city of Keene, 83-year-old Lucy Opal gushed as she handed him her autograph book. LUCY OPAL: And I've got lots of presidents in this book here. (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER) MITT ROMNEY: I hope you're getting one more. But time will tell. (SOUNDBITE OF APPLAUSE) OPAL: You know how I call you? Mitty. GONYEA: In Keene, the question was put to him politely. Fifty-year-old insurance broker Mike Kapiloff wondered why Romney won't call it a mistake. MIKE KAPILOFF: If you do mass health care, what's to stop you from doing that when you're the president? ROMNEY: Well, number one, as you know, I will oppose Obamacare. That's number one. And on day one I'll direct the secretary of Health and Human Services to grant a waiver to all 50 states of Obamacare. Number two, what we did in Massachusetts, I'm not going to apologize for it because it was right for Massachusetts. GONYEA: That answer satisfied Kapiloff, even as other GOP primary voters, especially those in the Tea Party movement, are still demanding an apology on the issue. Such questions about Romney are part of what has fueled the sudden rise of Rick Perry. But Perry has been a candidate less than two weeks and remains untested on the trail. So Romney's reaction is essentially not to react to him at all. When asked about the new Gallup poll by reporters in New Hampshire, he called Perry an effective candidate but said his strategy is unchanged. ROMNEY: If you're running for president, your focus should be on the person who is president and his failures and how you're going to make America better. GONYEA: Unidentified Man: To the next president of the United States of America... GONYEA: Unidentified Woman: What do you plan to do about Social Security benefits? Do you plan to cut them? ROMNEY: Who told you that? That I or any other Republican plans on cutting Social Security benefits? Where'd you hear that? GONYEA: Romney then accused Democrats of demagoguing the issue. Another person in the audience, who described himself as an independent voter, pressed Romney on climate change. Romney has said in the past he believes the Earth is warming and he believes that man is a cause. That puts him at odds with Rick Perry. But in Lebanon, his emphasis seemed more on what he doesn't know. ROMNEY: Do I think the world's getting hotter? Yeah. I don't know that, but I think it is. I'm not a scientist. Do I think we contribute to it? I don't know by how much. GONYEA: Over both days in New Hampshire, Romney kept up the attacks on President Obama, and last night in Dover he unveiled a new prop: a giant green digital clock constantly displaying the current national debt. He stood in front of it as he spoke to reporters. ROMNEY: Appreciate your being here this evening. It's a little warm. What's particularly warm is the speed with which that clock is having to move. We're going to be going across the country talking about the excessive borrowing and spending of this administration. GONYEA: It's Romney talking about a favorite subject, but with Rick Perry now surging, Romney's focus may have to shift from the man in the White House to the man from Texas.

Paul Ryan (R-WI).\n                \n                    \n                    Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI). The conservative opinion journal The Weekly Standard reported this week that Paul Ryan has decided \"for the final time\" that he will not be a candidate for president in 2012. The overtones of disappointment were not just audible, they were deafening. Even though Ryan has repeatedly rebuffed such urgings for months, the magazine had been picking up \u2013 and eagerly broadcasting \u2013 signals that the House Budget Chairman was reconsidering. Executive editor William Kristol even appeared on FOX News Sunday brandishing a \"Ryan-Rubio 2012\" button and saying it was 50-50 Ryan would run. Kristol & Co. have been panting after the seven-term congressman from Wisconsin ever since he released his budget proposals that would lower the top tax rates and make Medicare a private program with a limited government contribution. The magazine has also been high on Marco Rubio, a freshman senator from Florida, an early hero of the Tea Party who has since broadened his outreach. Ryan and Rubio represent states that voted Democratic in 2008 but swung hard to the right in 2010. They are Catholics, heightening their appeal to the largest swing voting group in the nation. Both Ryan's dollop of updated Jimmy Stewart charm and Rubio's connection to Hispanics could be potent assets on a wider stage, as well. The problem is, both men seem content with where they are in their lives and careers. Ryan is 41, Rubio 40. Each has every reason to think he'll get his shot at the national level, quite possibly at a time more propitious than the present. The Weekly Standard understands all this, of course, full well.  But the election of 2012 is now less than 15 months away, and it is clear that this organ and other elements of the Republican Party have not locked in on a candidate. Nary a day goes by without a rumor from New York regarding the imminent emergence of former Mayor Rudy Giuliani or former Gov. George Pataki. Neither fits the current mood of the party and neither has done much to mount a campaign, but neither seems willing to cross his name off the list (at least so long as the other man's name remains on). Media organizations based in New York need a New York candidate the way talk shows need a controversy.  Pataki's trip to Iowa this weekend will therefore be covered and dutifully reported, and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie will continue being mentioned as a potential surrogate champion for Gotham. The website Politico reports that \"conservative elites\" are driving the search for more candidates in the Republican field. They say the brainy fellows at the Standard and The Wall Street Journal editorial page fear Texas Gov. Rick Perry, Minnesota Rep. Michelle Bachmann and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney won't have what it takes to take down President Obama. Some may also note that these two publications, well known for their acerbic assessments of the president, are both owned by Rupert Murdoch, the media mogul whose global News Corp. also owns Fox. Murdoch has not been shy about using his power for political ends in Britain, and his influence may be less noted but no less felt in the U.S. There seems to be no special affection at Fox for any of the current Republican candidates, although any would surely be preferred over the incumbent. Early frontrunner Romney appears to have been more attractive to conservative activists and commentators four years ago, when he stood as an alternative to Arizona Sen. John McCain, whom they regarded as suspicious and unreliable. Now, of course, with a Democratic foil in the White House, conservatives have every motivation to hold out for someone they really like.  Not just someone who's more orthodox than McCain or Romney but someone who truly fires the imagination of those who read Ayn Rand in high school and von Hayek and von Mises in college. Whether geography or pedigree or purity is the problem, the search for the perfect Republican candidate goes on.  But it is worth remembering that in the late 1970s, as the GOP sought just the right opponent for incumbent Jimmy Carter, plenty of party people were not satisfied with a field that included Ronald Reagan.",

Rick Perry, who recently joined the GOP presidential race, speaks Thursday with patrons at Popovers in Portsmouth, N.H.\n                \n                    \n                    Darren McCollester/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who recently joined the GOP presidential race, speaks Thursday with patrons at Popovers in Portsmouth, N.H. Gov. Rick Perry made a splash the size of Texas into the Republican presidential field this week. He plunged in with events in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, demonstrating each step of the way that he's not shying away from controversy, or attention. On Monday in Cedar   Rapids, Iowa, Perry showed he is more than happy to attack even the chairman of the Federal Reserve. \"If this guy prints more money between now and the election,\" Perry said, \"I don't know what y'all would do to him in Iowa, but we would treat him pretty ugly down in Texas. \"I mean printing more money to play politics at this particular time in American history is almost treacherous, er, treasonous in my opinion.\" The Fed chairman is an independent post, and the current chairman, Ben Bernanke, was a Bush appointee. Republican guru Karl Rove, who worked in the Bush White House, was not amused. \"You don't accuse the chairman of the Federal Reserve of being a traitor to his country,\" Rove told Fox News. \"And suggesting that we treat him pretty ugly in Texas, that's not ... a presidential statement.\" President Obama was more forgiving, or perhaps patronizing. \"I'll cut him some slack,\" Obama told CNN. \"He's only been at it for a few days now.\" Weighing In On Global Warming On Wednesday, Perry arrived in New Hampshire, the country's first primary state, where he spoke at Politics and Eggs, a bipartisan meeting of business leaders. He planted a religious, social conservative flag by saying, \"There are a substantial number of scientists who have manipulated data\" on global warming. Earth's climate may be changing, he said, but it has been changing since the planet was formed. \"And I don't think, from my perspective, that I want America to be engaged in spending that much money on still a scientific theory that has not been proven,\" he said. Scientists and most governments across the globe agree \u2014 the data show that global warming is real, and caused by humans. University of New Hampshire political scientist Andy Smith, who attended the breakfast, says talking about social issues to a moderate New   Hampshire crowd was not Perry's worst offense Wednesday morning. In Smith's view, the whole speech just belly-flopped. \"Obvious applause lines didn't generate any applause, to the point where I as an audience member felt somewhat uncomfortable,\" Smith said. \"It was like a comedian kind of falling flat onstage.\" Mixed Reactions On Thursday, Perry raised eyebrows again in coastal Portsmouth, N.H. On a bright, sunny morning, he greeted people enjoying coffee and pastries at Popovers cafe. A boy, prompted by his mother, asked about evolution. \"It's a theory that's out there,\" Perry said. \"It's got some gaps.\" He went on, \"In Texas we teach both creationism and evolution in our public schools, because I figure you're smart enough to figure out which one is right.\" Actually, creationism is not part of the Texas public school curriculum. Texas does call on students to \"evaluate and analyze\" evolution, which could allow teachers to discuss creationism. At Popovers, a crowd of protesters hovered on the periphery shouting, \"Hands off our Medicare!\" and \"Stop the unionbusting!\" They carried signs saying, \"No Texas trash talk\" and \"Another Texas idiot for sale.\" George Carlisle, 61, who owns a local real estate company and lives above the cafe, is more open-minded. \"These guys are on and these women are on 24 hours a day,\" he says. \"We've got to be ready to see their humanity, too, and their foibles, and their flaws. If you put a microphone in front of Abraham Lincoln for 24 hours a day, I'm sure he'd say something stupid.\" Steve Scott, 51, is reserving judgment as well. \"The joke around New Hampshire is that you don't really know anybody until you meet them three times, and that goes [for] the federal candidates.\" Asked whether he has a favorite in the Republican presidential race, Scott says, \"I haven't met any of them three times yet.\"",

He is expected to unveil plans to stimulate the economy after Labor Day.\n                \n                    \n                    Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption President Obama speaks Wednesday at a town hall-style meeting at Wyffels Hybrids Inc. in Atkinson, Ill. He is expected to unveil plans to stimulate the economy after Labor Day. As President Obama embarks on vacation, he leaves behind roiling domestic markets, dismal unemployment numbers and speculation about what he'll propose in a planned jobs-and-economy speech after Labor Day. While he's expected to lay out some familiar strategies when he returns, from extending payroll tax cuts to new infrastructure spending, economists are looking for more \u2014 and for how Obama will balance election-year politics with the imperative to get something done and quickly in bitterly divided Washington. \"He's got a big jobs problem,\" says Kevin Hassett, economic policy studies director at the business-focused American Enterprise Institute. \"Partly through the failure of his policies and partly through timing,\" Hassett says, \"he's got the worst job-creation record since Herbert Hoover.\" A Gallup survey this week showed that Obama's approval rating on the economy has sunk to 26 percent. His previous low was 35 percent in November 2010. The nation's unemployment rate has been at or above 9 percent for four months. Though she may differ from Hassett on the cause and remedy, senior economist Eileen Appelbaum at the progressive Center for Economic and Policy Research agrees that the president's jobs efforts have fallen short. Obama \"got a stimulus in 2009 that stopped the free-fall, but it wasn't enough,\" she says. \"The president told us we'd be back at work and, look, we're not.\" Here are some comments from President Obama at a town hall this week in Atkinson, Ill., during his campaign-like swing through the upper Midwest: --\"There is no reason why we should not extend a payroll tax cut that put $1,000 into the pockets of every single family out there.\" --\"When Congress gets back in September, my basic argument to them is this: We should not have to choose between getting our fiscal house in order, and jobs and growth. We got to do both.\" --\"There's no reason why we shouldn't put Americans back to work all across the country rebuilding America. Interest rates are low, so we could finance right now the rebuilding of infrastructure all across America.\" --\"If everybody took an attitude of shared sacrifice, that we're not going to put the burden on any single person, we can solve our deficit and debt problem next week.\" Appelbaum says: \"I would like to see a clear statement from him about what he believes the American people need, and what he thinks he can get.\" But the pre-speech debate remains mired in what the government's role should be in getting people back to work in the short term, even if it contributes to the nation's budget deficit. The president is expected to argue the need for more government spending now, and has also said he'll push the new congressional \"supercommittee\" to come up with a longer-term plan to reduce the nation's deficit by more than its current goal of $1.5 trillion over 10 years. If Not Government, Who? Appelbaum is among a cadre of economists who argue that this precarious economic time requires that government spend, not retreat. \"I would like to propose to the president that he first stop saying the government is like your family, that you have to live within your means,\" she says. Appelbaum says she and her family borrowed to finance their mortgage, to put themselves and their three children through college, and often when they were the poorest. \"Families also don't have the Federal Reserve in their backyards; they can't print money,\" she says. Her spending argument goes like this: Of the four available economic engines \u2014 consumers, businesses, exports and the government \u2014 only the government has the ability and, perhaps, the will to invest in jobs right now. Consumers have retreated, businesses won't hire until they have consumers to sell to, and most of the rest of the world's economies are similarly suffering, she says. \"If the federal government also pulls back, how do we get out of the situation we're in?\" she says. \"It should be investing in education, infrastructure, research and direct job creation.\" At the Economic Policy Institute, labor market economist Heidi Shierholz also sees the need for a government role in creating jobs. \"It isn't tricky,\" Shierholz says. \"Government generally at a time like this has two major tools \u2014 fiscal policy and monetary policy.\" With interest rates already near zero, there is little the government can still do in the way of monetary policy that would have much effect. \"We're in this liquidity trap,\" she says. \"No one wants to invest.\" That leaves fiscal policy, she says, as the lever with the potential to reduce unemployment. \"The things we need now should be financed through deficit,\" Shierholz says. \"But the narrative in [Washington] has gone in the absolute opposite direction.\" No Keynes, But Common Ground At the American Enterprise Institute, Hassett is among economists who view the reliance on government spending to create jobs as failed Keynesian policy. \"If we pursue temporary policies like jacking up government spending, you give yourself a hangover,\" he says. \"We need to think about big, permanent policy changes.\" Programs like Social Security and Medicare need to be fixed, Hassett argues, and corporate tax cuts should be in Obama's mix of economic remedies, along with an overhaul of the federal unemployment insurance program. It's on the issue of unemployment insurance that economists like Hassett, Shierholz and Appelbaum have found common ground. They endorse a practice in Germany that allows companies to reduce worker hours in lieu of layoffs. The workers could then receive unemployment insurance for the hours they are no longer working. Say a company, instead of laying off workers, reduced overall worker hours by 25 percent. Under the so-called job-sharing program, the workers would be eligible for one day a week of unemployment benefits. Hassett has been pushing for such a program here along with Appelbaum's colleague, Dean Baker. \"Dean and I don't usually agree, but there are fundamental problems with people who are completely out of the workforce for a while,\" Hassett says. \"Cyclical unemployment becomes structural.\" \"It's a really good idea, and I think people on the left and right can agree,\" he says.",

            "article_content": "Eight Republican candidates for president will participate in a debate this evening in Ames, Iowa, on the campus of Iowa State University. The debate comes two days before thousands of Iowans participate in the Ames Straw Poll, an early test of voter mood and the candidates' organizations.  MELISSA BLOCK, host: From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Melissa Block. MICHELE NORRIS, host: And I'm Michele Norris. Eight Republican presidential candidates take the stage tonight for a debate in Ames, Iowa. It's a big week for politics there. On Saturday, Iowans will cast ballots in the Ames straw poll. It's a test of voter enthusiasm and a campaign's organizational strength. Both the straw poll and the debate are set against the backdrop of the Iowa State Fair. That's where candidates and voters get a chance to mingle over fattening, deep-fried novelties, often on a stick. And I'm joined from the fair in Des Moines by NPR national political correspondent Don Gonyea. We'll get to the food on the stick in a minute, but first, how's the fair and what are you hearing from the candidates? DON GONYEA: Well, the fair is gorgeous, beautiful weather. And the candidates have been all over this state. By one count, I saw something like 100 visits by candidates this week. But ultimately, it all leads to step one of this big 72 hours, tonight's debate. And it just feels like in that debate it's time for them to mix it up a little more than they have. The first couple of debates have been, I think it's fair to say, uneventful. They have been uniform in their criticism of President Obama. And if you're struggling to break through or looking to establish yourself, that just doesn't get it. NORRIS: Now, not all the candidates are actually fully participating in Saturday's straw poll and I'm wondering what that means for tonight's debate. Who's considered to be the frontrunner? GONYEA: Romney is certainly the national frontrunner but it feels like the frontrunner in Iowa is Michele Bachmann. This is a place where she does very well. There's a large Christian conservative base among the Iowa GOP and they're active and they turn out. Certainly, she's got Tea Party support, too. So, in some ways we have two frontrunners, but Romney has decided really not to play here in a big way. Because four years ago, he invested a lot of time, a lot of money, he won the straw poll and then finished second in the caucus when it rolled around. So, he's just dialed back the importance of this event. NORRIS: Don, there's something at that state fair called the soapbox. It's where candidates stand up and make a short speech and take a few questions. Mitt Romney got a pretty rough reception today it sounds like. GONYEA: It got contentious pretty fast. Now, there were some people in the first couple of rows who got there early. They were not Romney supporters. I would venture to say that they are not Republicans either. They seemed to be, you know, Democrats or progressive Democrats. And they immediately went after Romney during the question and answer, asking him about corporate profits and corporate tax loopholes. Give a listen to his response. MITT ROMNEY: Medicaid and Medicare are promises we can keep, and there are various ways of doing that. One is we could raise taxes on people. That's not the way UNIDENTIFIED MAN: (unintelligible) corporations. ROMNEY: Corporations are people, my friend. We can raise taxes on - of course they are. Everything corporations earn ultimately goes to people. GONYEA: Again, I don't know how well you could hear people in the crowd but that was kind of the tone for much of this Romney appearance. Certainly, what he was saying played well with Republicans in the crowd but you wonder how it plays more broadly than that. NORRIS: What do we expect to be the dominant issue tonight? GONYEA: The economy is going to be certainly a dominant issue, and especially all of the events of the past week - what the markets are doing, the Standard and Poor's downgrade. But, again, they're all in pretty much the same place on their condemnation of President Obama. The key will be how they separate themselves from one another in terms of the way forward. NORRIS: Well, Don, we can hear a lot of activity there behind you. And since you are at the state fair, I assume that you've managed to find something wonderful to eat on a stick? GONYEA: I had the deep-fried stick of butter and... NORRIS: How is that even possible? GONYEA: Well, that's all I'm going to say about it. NORRIS: Right. Well, I hope you have some Rolaids in your pocket. Don, thanks so much. GONYEA: Exactly. Thank you. NORRIS: That's NPR's Don Gonyea. Copyright \u00a9 2011 NPR.  All rights reserved.

All right, so we think we understand what Mitt Romney meant when he told some hecklers at the Iowa State Fair Thursday that \"corporations are people, my friend.\" Anybody these days fortunate to have a 401(k) retirement plan, or even a job with a corporation, understands that when a company makes a profit, there's a benefit to that firm's \"stakeholders,\" as executive-types like to say. Still, he gave his Democratic opponents an early Christmas gift by uttering those words. He just made their goal of pushing the narrative that he is a tool of corporate America much easier by providing them with that handy piece of video. These words could haunt him all the way to Election Day if he becomes the nominee. They could follow him the way President Obama's line about rural folks clinging to their guns and religion tagged along behind the Democrat. Romney's phrase burst from the gates like a thoroughbred, immediately hitting the Twittersphere with its own hashtag. And some of the tweets are quite funny, if not always grammatical: RT @jeezjon: Remember when we went out drinking with Target & AIG, and AIG totally starting hitting on that stripper? Good times. And: RT @AndyCobb: I FEEL TERRIBLE. Exxon had a birthday, and I didn't get him anything but subsidies. And that's so unspecial. And: If #CorporationsArePeople, what are their genders? Can two Corps marry? We know they can merge. #marriageequality Liz Halloran of NPR was in the crowd at the state fair for Romney's \"corporations are people\" line. \"Not his best moment,\" she tells us. But she also notes that Romney appeared to be willing to engage in a lively way with his critics which is apparent from some of the available video. In late morning sun, Romney, in jeans and polo shirt, mixed it up with a handful of people (or were they corporations?) in the crowd who loudly questioned his committment to preserving Social Security and Medicare benefits. (Labor folks had earlier promised some \"excitement\" at Romney's appearance) But it proved a pretty good moment for Romney who seemed more energized and engaged than he has in past at similar events. \"If you don't like my answer, you can vote for someone else,\" he said at one point, eliciting applause from a good-sized crowd that gathered to hear him speak among hay bales at the Des Moines Register's \"soap box.\"",

During the heated debate over the debt ceiling, the president canceled several fundraisers in order to focus on negotiations. During Washington's heated debate over the debt ceiling, President Obama and others in the administration canceled several campaign fundraisers as work on a compromise dragged on. But on Wednesday night, the eve of his 50th birthday, Obama went out to raise money at a pair of birthday-themed events in Chicago. The election is a long way off, but the country's long-term financial obligations seem certain to become a prime issue. It didn't take long after an agreement on the debt ceiling for Obama's official campaign website to post a video of the president talking directly to his supporters about the deal. \"This has been a long and messy process, and as with any compromise, the outcome is less than satisfying,\" he said. \"But it has also launched an important debate about how we approach the big challenges we face \u2014 about how we rebuild our economy.\" 'Unhappy, Disenchanted' That debate likely won't wane now that the debt-ceiling deadline has been met. The president's campaign is sizing up public reaction from his core Democratic base and independent voters, who are seen as critical to his re-election bid. \"My sense is that the public is very unhappy, disenchanted \u2014 you know, outraged, really \u2014 at what looked like an amateurish performance on everybody's part,\" said J. Ann Selzer, a veteran Iowa-based pollster. \"And independents in particular are kind of caught in an unhappy middle.\" The data regarding independent voters also contain troubling news for a president seeking re-election. \"It's independent voters that elected him to office. That's their game. That's how they win, and right now the polling trends show that independent voters are polling more like Republicans than they are like Democrats,\" Selzer said.  \"They've got to win them back; they've got to raise those numbers if they expect to win the White House again.\" Wooing Progressives But the debt deal also underscores the strain of discontent with the president among liberal Democrats.  Progressives complained that Obama gave away too much too early to the GOP and didn't fight hard enough for revenue increases as part of the package. So he looks ahead to the 2012 race having to mend some fences with activists in his own party. Neera Tanden of the liberal Center for American Progress in Washington says the president needs to offer solutions on jobs. \"But also he has to say to progressives that, you know, over the course of this next year he welcomes a debate on the role of government,\" she said. \"He welcomes a debate on essentially what has been missing over the last couple of months, which is that differences between the parties are stark.\" Tanden says the president cannot take the votes of Democrats for granted \u2014 especially given how many are facing economic anxiety. A strong message on jobs, and on protecting Medicare and Social Security, is one that will appeal to both progressives and independent voters, she says. Midwest Bus Tour The White House announced Wednesday that the president will take a bus tour through the Midwest the week after next to discuss the economy. \"I think their instinct to go out on the road is a good one,\" said Mike Murphy, a Republican strategist. \"I want to see what the messaging is.\" No details regarding the Midwestern itinerary have been announced. Obama will no doubt be in states that are still struggling, but perhaps in places relieved that General Motors and Chrysler are coming back after getting billions in federal help. \"If he has a smart jobs message on the road that plays credibly, it'll probably be helpful to him,\" Murphy said. \"If he tries to take a victory tour on the auto industry or something, it'll backfire, because people don't think we're out of the woods. People think the woods are getting worse.\" At Wednesday's briefing at the White House, the press secretary was asked if the bus tour represents the president pivoting back to jobs.  His response: that it's not a shift, and that jobs have been a constant concern for the president. With jobs being a huge issue for both independent and Democratic voters, look for the president to try to keep the focus on his efforts in that area, and to get past the wrangling of the past few weeks in Washington.",

Assuming the debt-ceiling deal reached Sunday is approved by rank and file members of both parties in the Senate and House, some fairly ugly firsts will be averted. The nation won't have it's first-ever default on its financial obligations, with likely consequences both devastating and unpredictable for an already listless economy, despite what default deniers have said. Also, President Obama won't be the first president forced to run the dubious experiment of campaigning for re-election with a fresh national default on his resume. He won't be the first president to have a default happen on his watch, period. It's hard to overstate the damage such an unprecedented fiscal failure would likely have done not just to the economy but also to national psyche. Americans, after all, still view themselves as living in a global economic dynamo and the world's most successful democracy. A default caused by political stalemate could have changed that self-image incalculably. Maybe Obama could get re-elected with a default under his belt. But it certainly would've increased the already considerable challenges facing him because of high unemployment, housing foreclosures and other spurs to economic anxiety. While some polls suggested voters would blame congressional Republicans more if there were a default, it would be much easier for those same voters to blame the familiar face in the Oval Office than the mostly unknown mass of Capitol Hill lawmakers. So Obama appears to have dodged the worst-case scenario for his re-election campaign: an economy-wrenching default. The deal keeps him in the game. He also got Republicans to concede on the notion of another debt ceiling fight next year. Obama and congressional Democrats couched their resistance to another debt-ceiling fight as a desire to keep further uncertainties from casting clouds over the economy. But the political dimension was readily apparent to just about everyone. Democrats saw themselves as politically vulnerable if they were forced to push for a debt ceiling increase in an election year. They could easily envision the ads that would be run against them. Those fears have now been quieted. Obama can also point to as a positive his willingness to compromise. The independent voters vital to his re-election hopes have said in repeated surveys that they want more political compromise that brings results. So Obama can boast of being a great compromiser. Of course, one person's compromise is another's appeasement. A downside in the deal for Obama is that liberals charge that he conceded entirely too much to Republicans. After all, Republicans got a ton of spending cuts, Democrats got none of the tax increases they were looking for, while Obama put changes to reduce the costs of Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security on the table. Expressing the view of many progressives, economist and columnist Paul Krugman wrote: It is, of course, a political catastrophe for Democrats, who just a few weeks ago seemed to have Republicans on the run over their plan to dismantle Medicare; now Mr. Obama has thrown all that away. And the damage isn't over: There will be more choke points where Republicans can threaten to create a crisis unless the president surrenders, and they can now act with the confident expectation that he will. Some things are worth disappointing your political base to avoid, and default is one of them, is what Obama appears to be signaling. On the other side of the aisle, that deal can only be read as a significant achievement for the tea party movement. As numerous Republicans have noted in recent days, the whole tenor of the fiscal discussion in Washington has changed since last year, and that's because of the tea party movement. The nation has moved, in a little over two years, from serial attempts at large government stimulus spending to kick-start the economy, to a debate over the best ways to reduce deficits and the national debt. Whatever one might think of them, it has to be acknowledged that it was the tea party-linked lawmakers who have served as the steel in the spine, the Lady Macbeth, to congressional Republican leadership. The contours of the agreement \u2014 the emphasis on spending cuts without revenue increases and the inclusion of an enforcement mechanism \u2014 are a result of the tea party lawmakers' willingness to take the nation to the brink of default, all the while maintaining pressure on their own leadership. Unless there's some dramatic event that we can't now foresee that changes the focus, it appears the tea party has guaranteed that the 2012 election won't only be a referendum on how Obama has handled the economy. Because of the tea party's new power in American politics, the 2012 campaign is also shaping up to be a fierce contest over not whether to reduce deficits and debt \u2014 that's now a given \u2014 but the best and quickest ways to do so, with \"best\" being a value judgment based on one's political ideology. A presidential and congressional cycle that was supposed to be all about jobs is now about not only that but also the best way for the U.S. to address its long-term debt issues. That's a significant change.",

At the microphone is Joel Silberman, also with the American Dream Movement. President Obama may have lost a direct hand in the  debt-limit negotiations, but some of his liberal base is still seething at the concessions  he was willing to make to Republicans \u2014 especially Social Security and Medicare cuts that may yet be in the  offing. When a few hundred liberal activists protested outside the Capitol on Thursday, they vented most of their frustrations at Republican lawmakers \u2014 especially the Tea Party caucus \u2014 who called for deep cuts to safety net programs in exchange for raising the debt ceiling. But they also blamed Obama for agreeing to put entitlement programs on the bargaining table at all. That discontent is starting to seep into the deepest corners of Obama's base. A Washington  Post/ABC News poll released this week showed the president's poll numbers falling, even among liberals and African-Americans \u2014 his most loyal backers. Only 31 percent of liberal Democrats expressed strong  support for Obama's record on jobs, a severe drop from 53 percent last year. And  slightly more than half of blacks believe Obama has helped the economy, compared with 77 percent of them in October. To his liberal supporters, Obama's concessions on the debt plan were just his latest failure to defend core  Democratic principles. Last year, he extended the Bush-era tax  cuts for the wealthiest Americans and gave up the public option  in the health care debate. I think one of the reasons the president has been able to move so far to the right is that there is no primary opposition to him, and I think it would do this country a good deal of service if people started thinking about candidates out there to begin contrasting what is a progressive agenda, as opposed to what Obama is doing. Sen. Bernie Sanders \"Most progressives who care about what the central  legacy is of the Democratic Party \u2014 like the creation of Social Security and  Medicare \u2014 are astounded by what the president was willing to put on the  table,\" says prominent liberal activist Robert Borosage, president of the Campaign for  America's Future. \"These are not progressive policy reforms, nor what the  president campaigned on.\" Obama sees it differently. \"I view Social Security and Medicare as the most important  social safety nets that we have,\" he said at a press conference on July 15. \"I think it is important for them to  remain as social insurance programs that give people some certainty and  reliability in their golden years. But it turns out that making some modest  modifications in those entitlements can save you trillions of dollars. And it's  not necessary to completely revamp the program.\" That didn't mollify the activists who gathered outside the Capitol this week. \"What's on the table right now is an embarrassment,\" John Gage, president of the American Federation of Government Employees, which  claims 600,000 members nationwide, told protesters. \"Brothers and sisters, I'll  tell you, I'm tired of losing. We will draw a line on Social Security and  Medicare. We're not going back!\" To demonstrate their opposition to Medicare cuts, some  of Thursday's  protesters at the Capitol wore hospital gowns that opened in back,   exposing fake rubber buttocks. They also wore signs that said, \"Don't  Leave Us  Uncovered.\" One of the president's own former advisers even leveled  a thinly veiled shot at him. It came from Van Jones, Obama's former  environmental policy adviser, whose new progressive group, American Dream  Movement, helped organize the event. \"The movement for change did not have a slogan of 'Yes  He Can,' \" Jones said in an interview after the rally, referring to Obama's 2008  presidential campaign. \"It was 'Yes We Can.' We can influence both parties to do  what's right. Everybody in this town, both parties, needs to listen to the 60 to  70 percent of Americans who don't want to see Social Security destroyed.\" Liberals were stunned at some of the concessions President Obama seemed willing to make in the debt-ceiling negotiations, especially when it came to the two big entitlement programs. Social  Security Obama was willing to change the inflation index used to  calculate cost-of-living increases for recipients. Adopting the so-called  \"chained Consumer Price Index,\" would generate savings. But it also  would slightly lower benefit payouts. Democratic activists would prefer to lift the cap on how much income is subject to Social Security payroll taxes. Both debt-ceiling proposals in Congress  would create an appointed committee to propose future cuts to the program. Medicare Obama was open to raising the eligibility age to 67 from  65, a move that would save roughly $124.8 billion between 2014 and 2021, according to the Congressional Budget Office. --Corey Dade Recently, staunchly liberal Sen. Bernie Sanders of  Vermont, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats, told talk radio host  Thom Hartmann that Obama should face a primary challenger in his 2012 re-election  bid: \"I think one of the reasons the president has been able to move so far to  the right is that there is no primary opposition to him, and I think it would do  this country a good deal of service if people started thinking about candidates  out there to begin contrasting what is a progressive agenda, as opposed to what  Obama is doing.\" Will the Democratic left really abandon Obama next year? Liberals themselves acknowledge that isn't likely,  mainly because there's no viable alternative. Others say Obama's pitched battles with House  Republicans may actually energize their core supporters next  year. \"I  think that it enhances our ability to turn out the  base,\" Rep. Keith  Ellison (D-MN), co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus,  said as  he left the rally. \"I wish he wouldn't have done it,\" he said of Obama   offering up social safety net programs for cuts. \"But I don't blame the  president for  it. He doesn't want to cut these programs. He sort of  made a desperate  offer.\" Even the president's most liberal critics acknowledge that cutting deals with the GOP is not what makes Obama most vulnerable in 2012. \"The point is, what kind of  enthusiasm will he get when he goes out and knocks on the doors of the  independents and working families when unemployment is at 9 percent?\" Borosage  says. \"If you make the economy worse with this, I can assure you it will have a  much more damaging effect to his re-election chances than any agreement he comes  to with Republicans.\"",

She and others walked to  President Obama's campaign headquarters in Chicago last week to deliver 200,000 signatures from people who would refuse to donate or volunteer for his re-election campaign if Obama cuts entitlement programs. Lately you'd think President Obama was threatening to push Granny off the cliff. That's pretty much been the reaction of liberal Democrats to even the hint that the president might consider reductions in spending for Medicare as part of a deal to raise the nation's debt ceiling. \"Any cuts to Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid should be taken off the table,\" the Congressional Progressive Caucus wrote in a letter to the president. \"These cuts would hurt households and damage the country's economic recovery as well.\" But most of the outrage assumes \u2014 incorrectly \u2014 that any cuts would necessarily be aimed directly at Medicare patients. History suggests otherwise. Because Medicare is such a huge budget target, \"we've had a series of cuts, year after year, decade after decade,\" says Joe Antos, a health economist with the conservative American Enterprise Institute. How big a target is Medicare exactly? This year the Congressional Budget Office figures the program for the elderly and disabled will spend $562.8 billion. Even with all the cuts to Medicare over the years, Antos says, \"We've hardly ever directly touched beneficiaries.\" In fact, says Antos, who spent years estimating savings for some of those budget cuts at CBO, \"the whole political history of (cutting) Medicare has been focused not on beneficiaries, it's been focused on health care providers,\" such as doctors, hospitals and nursing homes. And in many of those cases, he says, beneficiaries have often not even felt the reductions in payments. One example was the 1983 shift in the way Medicare pays hospitals from simply paying each bill to a prospective payment system, that paid a set amount per diagnosis. That encouraged hospitals to become more efficient. \"We saved an enormous amount of money by moving to that system, and in the process, we changed the way hospital service is delivered to people, for the better, I think\" Antos says. \"That was, I think a win for everybody.\" Now it's true that most of the cuts have been reductions in scheduled increases, which served to restrain growth of Medicare's budget some. And it's also the case that patients have been touched by Medicare payment changes, and could be again in the future. Higher-income beneficiaries now pay higher premiums for Medicare outpatient coverage as a result of the 2003 Medicare prescription drug law. And the budget plan passed by the House in April would shift considerable cost from the government to seniors on the program. But Antos says beneficiaries are always last in line when it comes to making cuts in Medicare spending. \"In terms of direct cuts to beneficiaries or benefits, that is a highly unpopular thing for a politician to do,\" he says. Just ask all the Democrats who lost their seats last year after getting pummeled by Republicans who complained about the $500 billion in Medicare reductions in the Affordable Care Act, the federal law overhauling the health care system. How many of those cuts directly increase costs or reduce access for beneficiaries? Zero.",

Based on an advance text of Jon Huntsman's kick off speech for his campaign for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination, he plans to take the high road to the White House. In the first speech of his official presidential campaign, Huntsman declared he would disagree with President Obama, the Democrat in the White House, as well his fellow Republicans competing to oust the president, without demonizing them. The former Utah governor also offers a dual vision of America \u2014 one of a dire future, the other more upbeat. On one hand, Huntsman paints a picture of a nation at a precipice. It's the first time one generation of Americans could hand over to the next one a nation with diminished prospects. \"This is totally unacceptable and totally unAmerican\" he says. On the other hand, Americans choose their destiny, he says. \"We always have and we always will.\" Huntsman offers himself to lead Americans away from the cliff of fiscal crises to the more optimistic destiny. But, of course, he has a difficult balancing act to make his case. He was part of the Obama Administration as its ambassador to China. So it would be awkward for him to attack the president since he was actually a Republican on the president's team and left not in public huff over policy disagreements but because he wanted to make a presidential run. Many of the Republican voters who have it in their power to give him the nomination, however, want to hear a strong case against Obama. And they also want to know why Huntsman would be the best Republican candidate to make it. Huntsman tries to deal with these issues from the outset by saying it will take more than hope to turn the economy around, a clear dig at Obama's 2008 campaign messages of \"hope\" and \"change.\" He also says government doesn't have all the answers. That's another swipe at Obama who has become identified in many Republican eyes for large and costly government-imposed solutions because of the health care legislation as well as financial sector and auto industry bailouts. Huntsman says: What we need now is leadership that trusts in our strength.  Leadership that  doesn't promise Washington has all the solutions to our  problems, but rather  looks to local solutions in our cities, towns and  states. Leadership that knows  we need more than hope, leadership that  knows we need Answers. But Huntman sends the message that he doesn't intend a negative campaign. Again, that's in part out of necessity since it would be hard to bash a president he worked for and even praised in writing. He also appears to signal that he doesn't intend to rip apart his competitors for the GOP nomination. I don't think you need to run down anyone's reputation to run for  President.  Of course we'll have our disagreements. I respect my fellow  Republican  candidates. And I respect the President. He and I have a  difference of opinion  on how to help the country we both love. But the  question each of us wants the  voters to answer is who will be the  better President; not who's the better  American. That could appeal, however, to moderate Republican voters and Republican-leaning independents who always say they're tired of political bickering. The question for Huntsman is, will there be enough of them in the primaries who vote for him to give him the nomination? Read excerpts from his speech below: I'm Jon Huntsman. I've been a governor, a businessman, and a diplomat. I'm  the husband of the love of my life, and the father of seven terrific kids. A son  of great parents. I'm from the American west, where the view of America is limitless with lots  of blue sky. I've lived overseas, where the view of America from 10,000 miles away is a  picture of liberty, opportunity and justice; people secure in their rights and  in love with their freedom, who've done more good for more people than any other  nation in history. And today, I'm a candidate for the office of President of the United States  of America.  ... For the first time in our history, we are about to pass down to the next  generation a country that is less powerful, less compassionate, less competitive  and less confident than the one we got. This is totally unacceptable and totally un-American. And it NEED not, MUST not, WILL not be our permanent condition. We will not  be the first American generation that lets down the next generation.  ... What we need now is leadership that trusts in our strength. Leadership that  doesn't promise Washington has all the solutions to our problems, but rather  looks to local solutions in our cities, towns and states. Leadership that knows  we need more than hope, leadership that knows we need Answers. And we must make hard decisions that are necessary to avert disaster. If we  don't, in less than a decade, every dollar of federal revenue will go to  covering the costs of Medicare, Social Security and interest payments on our  debt. Meanwhile, we'll sink deeper in debt to pay for everything else - from  national security to disaster relief. Our country will fall behind the  productivity of other countries. Our influence in the world will wane. Our  security will be more precarious. The 21st Century then will be known as the end  of the American Century. We can't accept this, and we won't. We must make broad and bold changes to our tax code and regulatory policies;  seize the lost opportunity of energy independence...and reestablish what it  means to be a teacher in society. We must reignite the powerful job creating engine of our economy - the  industry, innovation, reliability, and trailblazing genius of Americans and  their enterprises \u2014 and restore confidence in our people. We did many of these things in Utah when I was governor. We cut taxes and  flattened rates. We balanced our budget. Worked to maintain our AAA bond rating.  When the economic crisis hit, we were ready. And by many accounts we became the  best state for business and the best managed state in America. We proved  government doesn't have to choose between fiscal responsibility and economic  growth. I learned something very important as Governor. For the average American  family there is nothing more important than a job.  ... I don't think you need to run down anyone's reputation to run for President.  Of course we'll have our disagreements. I respect my fellow Republican  candidates. And I respect the President. He and I have a difference of opinion  on how to help the country we both love. But the question each of us wants the  voters to answer is who will be the better President; not who's the better  American. Behind me is our most famous symbol of the promise of America. President  Reagan launched the 1980 general election here in an earlier time of trouble and  worry. He assured us we could \"make America great again,\" and under his  leadership we did. I stand in his shadow as well as the shadow of this  magnificent monument to our liberty.  ... We're a resourceful, ingenious, determined, problem solving people. We don't  settle for less than our character and talents can achieve. We choose our  destiny. We always have, and we always will. This is that moment. We're not just choosing new leaders. We're choosing  whether we are to become yesterday's story or tomorrow's. Everything is at  stake. This is the hour when we choose our future",

Rick Santorum, Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann, ex-House Speaker Newt Gingrich, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, Texas Rep. Ron Paul, ex-Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty and businessman Herman Cain.\n                \n                    \n                    Jim Cole/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption The field of GOP presidential contenders appeared onstage for their first major debate in New Hampshire, taking aim at President Obama, criticizing his handling of the economy and vowing to repeal his health care overhaul. Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, the presumed front-runner, set the tone for Monday night's debate by explaining that any of the Republican contenders present \"would be a better president than President Obama.\" Obama, he said, \"has failed at job one, which is to get the economy going again. He failed at job two, which is to restrain the size of government, and he failed at job three, which is to have a consistent foreign policy,\" Romney said. The New Hampshire event took place more than six months before the state plays host to the first primary of the 2012 campaign. The seven candidates were so careful not to turn their rhetorical firepower against one another that Tim Pawlenty, the former governor of Minnesota, backed away from an attack he had launched just a day before on Romney, coining the term \"Obamneycare\" to conflate Romney's Massachusetts health care law with the Obama's national health care law. Debate moderator John King of CNN pressed Pawlenty three times to explain the term. Pawlenty finally offered up that he was simply quoting Obama as saying that he looked to Massachusetts while crafting the national program. \"He's the one who said it's a blueprint and that he merged the program,\"Pawlenty explained. \"So, calling it Obamneycare was a reflection of the president's comments.\" Most of the debate, however, focused on the economy, which has undergone its worst downturn since the Great Depression and continues to dog the Obama administration. Former Godfather's Pizza CEO Herman Cain used what may have been the most colorful analogy of the evening to make a point. \"This economy is stalled. It's like a train on the tracks with no engine,\" he said. \"And this administration has simply been putting all of the money in the caboose. We need an engine called the private sector.\" The typically verbose Texas Rep. Ron Paul, a leading figure in the Tea Party movement, was stumped when the moderator asked whether Obama had \"done one thing right when it comes to the economy.\" \"Boy, that's a tough question. No, no, I can't think of anything,\" Paul said. Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann made a mark in the first 10 minutes by announcing she was officially in the race, saying she had filed her paperwork the very day of the debate. She reminded the audience that she led the House Tea Party caucus, but she tried to burnish her foreign policy credentials by discussing Libya. \"I sit on the House Select Committee on Intelligence. We deal with the country's vital national secrets. We, to this day, do not know who the rebel forces are that we're helping,\" she said. While Bachmann tried to reach beyond social issues, former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum made an overt pitch to the social conservatives around whom he has built his career. \"Not only have I been consistently pro-life; I've not just taken the pledge \u2014 I've taken the bullets,\" Santorum said. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, hoping the debate would resuscitate his ailing campaign, damaged by a mass defection of his senior staff last week, tried again to explain why he once described House Republicans' Medicare plan as \"right-wing social engineering.\" \"If you're dealing with something as big as Medicare and you can't have a conversation with the country where the country thinks what you're doing is the right thing, you'd better slow down,\" Gingrich said. Instead, Gingrich, like the others, preferred to lay into the president's handling of the economy. \"When 14 million Americans are out of work, we need a new president to end the Obama Depression,\" he declared. Pundits have been writing Gingrich off, but most voters are not yet focused on 2012. One of the biggest applause lines of the night came from Romney, who gave the score from the Stanley Cup hockey finals just after a commercial break. \"And by the way \u2014 Bruins are up 4-0,\" he said to huge cheers. Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin was not present \u2014 her plans on whether to run are still up in the air. Several other likely candidates have decided not to run, including Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour and Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels. But at least one who ruled out a race is reconsidering. Texas Gov. Rick Perry has said he will decide after the state Legislature completes its current session.",

As NPR's Mara Liasson reported for the network's newscast: Gingrich's entire staff in Iowa, his national consultants and his long time aide, Rick Tyler, have resigned. This occurred just as Gingrich came back form a controversial  vacation in the Greek islands with his wife Callista. The Greek cruise was seen as yet another political problem for the former House speaker, who had raised eyebrows when it was discovered he had once had a charge account at Tiffany with a balance of over $250,000. Gingrich's former aides in Iowa complained that he wasn't doing what was necessary to get his campaign of the ground in Iowa. Here's a list of those who quit: Campaign manager Rob Johnson Campaign Spokesman Rick Tyler (longtime spokesman) David Carney, New Hampshire based consultant Sam Dawson, strategist Katon Dawson, South Carolina consultant (former state party chair) Craig Schonfeld, an Iowa consultant. The Des Moines Register quotes Schoenfeld who gives these additional Iowa staffers. Katie Koberg, deputy campaign director Page Thorson, coalitions director Daniel Weiser, Ryan Keller and Joe Heuertz (field staff) Gingrich's campaign has been snake-bitten since the start. If any presidential campaign in the modern era has had a worse beginning, it's hard to think of it. Just days after he announced he was officially in the race for the GOP presidential nomination, Gingrich angered many in his own party by criticizing the House GOP's Medicare restructuring plan as \"right-wing social engineering.\" He apologized, but for many Republicans still haven't forgiven him. Then there was the Tiffany revelation followed by the cruise. Gingrich's immediate problem is that he's lost key staff at a critical time, eight weeks before the Ames straw poll in Iowa. His medium term problem is that it's hard to convince donors and voters they should support you when your aides are voting with their feet and exiting your campaign. This afternoon, after news broke about all the departures, whoever was left at the Gingrich campaign issued the following statement: \"I am committed to running the substantive, solutions-oriented campaign I set  out to run earlier this spring. The campaign begins anew Sunday in Los  Angeles.\"",

            "article_content": "Rick Santorum, the former U.S. senator from Pennsylvania who has cultivated a following among some social conservatives in his party, said Monday he was officially entering the race for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination. Santorum never really gave politics watchers any reasons to doubt he would enter the wide open race for the GOP nomination. His interest in the White House has long been known though his resounding 2006 Senate re-election defeat at the hands of Democrat Sen. Bob Casey placed more than a little speed bump in front of those plans. Before his announcement speech in the western Pennsylvania town of Somerset in the state's coal mining region, Santorum told George Stephanopoulos on ABC News' Good Morning America that he perceived a path to the nomination. \"In the early primary states we have a lot of momentum and we're very excited about it.\" \"... What people are looking for is somebody who has stood by their principles in good times and bad. In 2006, by everybody's estimation, was a pretty bad time for a Republican and particularly for a conservatives, particularly in states like Pennsylvania. And I stood up and I didn't back away. I didn't back down on trying to reform the Social Security system...\" The Social Security point was noteworthy because Santorum used it to suggest he has a boldness even greater than Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI) when it comes to  reforming entitlements. Ryan, chair of the House Budget Committee, is associated with a controversial and unpopular plan to essentially privatize Medicare. Social Security is viewed by many Americans as even more sacrosanct so Santorum's point was that if conservatives were impressed by Ryan, they should be even more impressed by him. Santorum chose the western Pennsylvania town of Somerset in an old coal mining region for his announcement because it was near a mine where his Italian grandfather worked after immigrating to the U.S. As Stephanopoulos noted, Santorum has done well in early tests of his popularity with the party's base, winning straw polls in New Hampshire and South Carolina. But he likely will have competition for the social conservative vote from Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.) who is widely expected to run as well as Atlanta businessman and radio talk show host Herman Cain, to name just two. Also, Santorum is barely registering in the polls, coming in at two percent in a recent Gallup Poll compared with frontrunner Mitt Romney who was at 17 percent. Sarah Palin, who isn't an announced candidate, was at 15 percent. Because he has been so outspoken on issues such as abortion and gay rights, Santorum is widely reviled by many liberals which no doubt further enhances his appeal with some conservatives. For instance, in a 2003 Associated Press interview, Santorum made comments in which he clearly placed homosexual relationships in a morally gray area between heterosexual relationships and illegal, immoral and aberrant sexual relations. He said: \"Every society in the history of man has upheld the institution of marriage as a bond between a man and a woman. Why? Because society is based on one thing: that society is based on the future of the society. And that's what? Children. Monogamous relationships. In every society, the definition of marriage has not ever to my knowledge included homosexuality. That's not to pick on homosexuality. It's not, you know, man on child, man on dog, or whatever the case may be. It is one thing. And when you destroy that you have a dramatic impact on the quality\" To which the AP reporter, Lara Jakes Jordan, uttered one of the most memorable journalistic responses ever to an interviewee's answer: I'm sorry, I didn't think I was going to talk about \"man on dog\" with a United States senator, it's sort of freaking me out.",

The deciding issue may have been the GOP's plan to revamp Medicare. In addition, more names are surfacing as potential Republican presidential candidates.  RENEE MONTAGNE, host: And the political world got a jolt this week. A Democrat in western New York won election to Congress in a district that had been held by Republican Party for four decades. The deciding issue may have been the Republican plan to revamp Medicare. Also this week, every time we thought the Republican presidential field might be settling down, a new name - or a familiar old one - resurfaced. Which is why NPR political editor Ken Rudin is with us this morning in the studio. He's here to help us make sense of all of this. Good morning. KEN RUDIN: Good morning, Renee. MONTAGNE: OK, so Democrat Kathy Hochul's victory in the New York district -26th district election this week, takes away a traditionally Republican seat. Was - I mean - was this, in fact, Medicare? RUDIN: Well, Republicans say it was actually - part of - part of the reason they lost the seat, it was the presence of a third party candidate, the Tea Party candidate, Jack Davis, who was on the ballot. And he was basically - the Republican candidate, Jane Corwin spent much of the early campaign, attacking the Tea Party candidate cause she was afraid of him siphoning - him siphoning off votes from her. And by doing that, it raised her own negatives. And while this was all happening, the Democrat - Kathy Hochul - was focusing on the Medicare issue from day one - from moment one - on the fact that Corwin her party's plan to revamp Medicare. And that frightened a lot of voters, especially, whenever - whenever you tinker with Medicare, that scares voters. Yesterday, in an interview with NPR's Michel Martin on TELL ME MORE, Hochul credited the Medicare issue with her victory. Ms. KATHY HOCHUL (Congresswoman-Elect, Democrat, New York): The Ryan budget gave us an opportunity to talk about Medicare, but also the other priorities in that budget, such as tax breaks that continue for the very wealthiest people in this country. So we weren't afraid to really open up that budget and show people the difference. And when my opponent said, had she been in Congress she would have voted for it; just gave us an opportunity to say, you know what, we wouldn't have done that and here's why. MONTAGNE: OK, so a little Tea Party challenge in there, but also, the Democrats are hoping this - the whole question of Medicare and Medicare reform - will be a winning issue for them in 2012. RUDIN: Oh, absolutely, and that's exactly why Senate Majority Leader had an up-and-down vote, Wednesday, on the Ryan budget plan in the Senate. The idea was, if the Republicans voted for it, then Democrats would take out, you know, revenge on the Republicans in 2012. And if the Republicans oppose it, they open themselves up for a Tea Party, or a conservative party challenge in the primary. Remember what happened when Newt Gingrich opposed it, earlier, a few weeks ago. He called it right wing social engineering. He got pilloried by conservatives. So Democrats hope this will really split the GOP. MONTAGNE: While were on the subject of the presidential race, 2012, a lot of people were saying that once Mitch Daniels of Indiana opted out of the running, the Republican field was pretty much set. Not the case, though. RUDIN: No, absolutely. It's still in flux. Minnesota congresswoman Michele Bachmann said yesterday, that she's going to make a major announcement next month in Waterloo, Iowa. That's the sight of the first presidential caucuses -and where she was born. Many think she's going to declare her candidacy. Social conservatives do very well in Iowa. Mike Huckabee won the caucuses there in 2008. And Michele Bachmann remains a strong Tea Party favorite. There's also Sarah Palin. You know, every time we're convinced that she's fading from public view, she pops back up. Yesterday, her political - there was an announcement from her Political Action Community, that Sarah Palin will launch a one nation bus tour of the East Coast, starting Sunday, with an eventual stop in - guess where? - New Hampshire. Plus, there's a new, full length feature movie about her career that her supporters have produced, that will be distributed the summer to activists in Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina. Do I think she's gonna run, is she serious, or is she Donald Trump? I mean, I really don't know. I don't think anybody really knows what she's gonna do. But everything she does gets magnified and we just have to sit and wait and watch -you know, watch and wait. Also, one more thing: Mitt Romney, the erstwhile frontrunner, he announces his candidacy June 2nd in New Hampshire. MONTGNE: And we just have a few seconds left, but we do have a couple of seconds. What about Texas governor Rick Perry, and talk of him possibly running? RUDIN: Well, nobody knows, for sure, what he's gonna do. Every time he's asked, he says he hasn't ruled it out. Some of his advisors are convinced that he's going - he's raring to go. He's the nation's longest-serving governor. And remember, being a Republican from Texas is a big plus. The last Republican who was elected president without any connections to Texas or California was Calvin Coolidge in 1924. MONTAGNE: Let me think about that for a moment.

Not that there was much doubt left, but Tuesday's uphill victory by Democrat Kathy Hochul in a special election in a New York congressional district long dominated by the GOP has made it pretty clear that the budget blueprint approved by House Republicans last month, which would effectively privatize Medicare, isn't so popular with lots of actual voters. But with health care still the No. 1 one issue driving the nation's long-term budget problems, advocates for seniors and the poor are worried that would-be budget balancers will set their sites on the vast Medicaid program for the poor instead. And they've got good reason to be concerned. First, the same House budget blueprint that proposes to transform Medicare would also turn the Medicaid program back to the states and at the same time make huge cuts \u2014 reducing federal funding to states by about a third within the next decade. And while that budget might not be going anywhere fast (it was voted down in the Senate on Wednesday), Republican Senators and members of the House have already introduced legislation that would make it easier for states to cut existing eligibility for Medicaid. That's seen as a bill likely to come up in negotiations on legislation to raise the federal debt ceiling later this summer. But Republicans who think it might be easier to pick on the poor than politically powerful seniors might want to think again. This month's health tracking poll from the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation finds that only 13 percent of those polled support major reductions in Medicaid spending as part of congressional efforts to reduce the deficit. At the same time, 60 percent want to keep Medicaid as it is. That means having the federal government guarantee coverage and set minimum standards for benefits and eligibility for every state. Perhaps even more striking, although maybe it shouldn't be given how much Medicaid has grown in recent years, is that more than half of respondents said they had a personal connection to the Medicaid program. That was defined as the respondent or a friend or family member having received assistance from the program at some point. Still, Medicaid supporters have their guard up. \"What a lot of people don't understand, is that Medicaid is so critically important for our nation's population,\" said Ron Pollack of Families USA. \"It is the bulwark of our long-term care system. If somebody needs nursing home care or other long-term care, it's Medicaid they go to. And for millions of people in the country, it really is THE safety net.\" But the fact remains that Medicaid, particularly with expansions envisioned as part of last year's Affordable Care Act, is projected to grow dramatically, to more than 78 million people by 2019, at an annual cost of $840 billion.",

            "article_content": "On Wednesday, the Senate defeated the House GOP Medicare plan. Host Michel Martin speaks with Kaiser Health News senior correspondent Mary Agnes Carey about what Medicare does, why some have objected to Rep. Paul Ryan's (R-WI) plan, and why five Republicans joined Democrats to vote down the GOP Medicare proposal.  MICHEL MARTIN, host: We wanted to talk a bit more about the politics of Medicare, especially the politics of trying to change the way it works. On Wednesday, the Senate voted down the House Republican plan put forward by House Budget Committee chair Paul Ryan. Five Republican senators broke with their party to help defeat it. We wanted to talk about the significance of these events and we've called Mary Agnes Carey, a senior correspondent at Kaiser Health News, for some perspective. I just want to emphasize that Kaiser Health News is an independent news service. It is not affiliated with the health insurance company. And she is here with us in our Washington, D.C. studio. Welcome back, thanks for joining us. AGNES CAREY: Thanks for having me. MARTIN: I just wanted to ask the same question I asked Congresswoman-elect Kathy Hochul. She's of course a Democrat. She just won this district that has been held by Republicans for decades. I asked her whether her election was, in fact, a referendum on this proposal. What do you think? CAREY: I think it absolutely was. I mean, it was possibly - I think it was the first election that came up after Paul Ryan's plan was introduced in the House and the House approved it. She talked about, in your interview with her, how heavily she campaigned on Medicare and Paul Ryan's plan and her opponent's support for that - if she had been in Congress she would have voted for it. And so this was heavily watched by both sides. Six million dollars spent in this race. Democratic analysts are certainly spinning this in their favor, saying this is an absolute repudiation of Paul Ryan's Medicare plan. And this is kind of a winning strategy for them if they go into 2012. MARTIN: As we mentioned, that Mr. Ryan and other national Republicans are saying that the plan has been mischaracterized. So why don't you tell us what it does? And, first of all, for people who don't know, what does Medicare do? MARY AGNES CAREY: Medicare is the health insurance plan for people over age 65, and some disabled Americans can get it if they're younger. What Paul Ryan's plan would do is if you are 54 or younger, when you enter Medicare, the Medicare program will negotiate with a series of private plans and give you choices of private health insurance plans and a set amount of money from which - for which you can use to buy health insurance. But the traditional fee-for-service plan - which now, something like 70 percent, 75 percent of Medicare beneficiaries are in - that goes away. The traditional fee-for-service plan is contracts with hospitals and doctors and other health providers, where they're paid a set amount of money to take care of you. The Medicare advantage plan, what the private plans currently are, is a set amount of money, again, for those health plans to take care of you. And the private insurance market would dominate in Paul Ryan's plan. There's no more traditional fee for service. MARTIN: And what are people concerned about, those who oppose the plan? Is it just the - is it philosophical? They just don't believe that something like that should be privatized? Or what's the objection to the plan, to those who object to it? CAREY: That's one of the objections. You shouldn't put Medicare completely, solely in the hands of the private insurance industry. There's also concern about will there be a set package - minimum package of benefits that have to be covered. That is unclear. They're also concerned about the amount of money that Paul Ryan has specified at this point in his plan. It won't be enough. And as time goes on and health inflation increases, that seniors will have to contribute thousands of dollars out of their own pockets for their coverage. MARTIN: In fact, there's a study to that effect that identifies a number. Is that a credible study? It says that some - more than $6,000, in fact, that seniors would have to pay that much more per person. Is that a credible study? CAREY: Yeah. The Congressional Budget Office are known around Washington as the CBO, which is sort of the official scorekeeper - nonpartisan scorekeeper of Washington - came out with those findings. It came out the day Paul Ryan announced his plan, and it was definitely - he got a lot of attention. MARTIN: And on the other side, though, that people even in the Democratic Party are cautioning that something has to be done about Medicare. Why is that? CAREY: Well, if you look at the long-term budget picture, our long-term federal debt, that entitlements are contributing to that. So Democrats are saying we have to have this part of the discussion. Republicans are saying we have to have this as part of the discussion. But what we've just seen in this election and in the debate over Paul Ryan's Medicare plan shows how politically polarizing this is. A voter, a typical American may say, yes. I want you to control entitlement spending, but when it comes down to changing their Medicare program, they object. And that's the difficult thing that everyone faces here as we have this discussion. MARTIN: And, finally, before we let you go, what can you tell me about the five Republican senators who joined with the Democrats to defeat the Republican plan in the Senate? They're known as moderates. But can you just tell us a bit more about why they voted against their party on this very difficult issue? CAREY: They thought that Paul Ryan's approach was too radical, it was too far. Republicans are trying to find their place on this. Some are unapologetic about the Ryan plan. They absolutely agree with it. Some want it modified, and some want absolutely nothing to do with it. So I think they want a more moderate approach on this than what Paul Ryan has taken. MARTIN: Mary Agnes Carey is a senior correspondent for Kaiser Health News. That's an independent news service that is not affiliated with the health insurance company. And she was kind enough to join us here in our Washington, D.C. studio. Mary Agnes, thanks so much for joining us. CAREY: Thanks for having me. Copyright \u00a9 2011 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Kathy Hochul, the Democrat who upset Republican hopes to hang onto a congressional seat in western New York state the GOP has held for decades, certainly appreciates the voters of her district who voted for her. In an interview with Michel Martin, host of NPR's Tell Me More, also readily apparent was her appreciation for the budget proposal to privatize Medicare by Rep. Paul Ryan, the Wisconsin Republican who chairs the House Budget Committee. Ryan's controversial proposal is credited with putting Republicans on the defensive and encouraging Democrats who think they have an issue which will have traction with voters, Hochul included. \"We certainly did use the Ryan budget as an opportunity to show the very clear cut difference between the candidates. \"And the Ryan budget gave us an opportunity to talk about Medicare but also other priorities in that budget such as tax breaks that continue for the wealthiest people in this country. We weren't afraid to open up that budget and show people the difference. \"When my opponent (Republican Jane Corwin) said, had she been in Congress she would have voted for it, it just gave us an opportunity to say, you know what? We wouldn't have done that and here's why. That resonated very much with people in this district and regardless of party label, they've embraced this message.\" Hochul dismissed GOP claims that she won because it was a three-way race: \"Well I think the Buffalo News today very much clarified that.\" It was an allusion to an editorial by that news outlet that suggested that Jack Davis, a Tea Party, third-party candidate who had run for the seat repeatedly in the past as a Democrat, might have hurt Hochul as much as her Corwin. Hochul continued: \"(The Buffalo News) said that's what Republicans want to say. And there was time in the polls when Jack was taking 20 -22 percent of the vote. \"But when Jack Davis started losing votes, they were coming my way, they were not going to Jane Corwin as they expected. All I know is I won because I got more votes. Everyone else can interpret what they will. But it's real simple to me that a lot of people put their faith in me. I take that very seriously and I know I'm representing a majority Republican district now.\" Hochul has served as the Erie County Clerk, which includes the city of Buffalo, since January 2007. The election results show that she won a majority of that county, with 53 percent of the vote, a strong showing in a three-way race. She did less well in the more rural counties of the district which Corwin more or less won. Hochul said a big task was getting known in those counties. I think people knew me in part of the district. But my challenge was to get much better known in the rural outlying areas where they had never heard of me before. I knew if I could just take my message on the road and I spent a tremendous amount of time literally pulling up to little businesses on the main streets and walking in, introduing myself, stopping in diners whereever I saw three or more cars. I really tried to have a personal touch to the race as well because we were really outspent. i was running against two multimillionaires. I had to break it down on the grassroots level. A lot of people had to go out on a limb, there were many, many people who said I was the first Democrat they had ever voted for. As the Buffalo News editorial also noted, Hochul's moment could prove just that: It's hard to say how long Hochul will be around to fix Social Security and Medicare. It is a Republican district, after all, and even worse for Hochul, one that could be liquidated by redistricting before the 2012 elections.",

Paul Ryan (R-WI) at NPR headquarters in Washington, D.C., earlier today (May 26, 2011).\n                \n                    \n                    Erin Schwartz/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI) at NPR headquarters in Washington, D.C., earlier today (May 26, 2011). One day after assailing Democrats for what he says are their \"Medi-scare\" political tactics, the author of the Republican plan to remake Medicare and Medicaid and cut the federal deficits and debts made the case that so far Republicans are \"negotiating with ourselves\" on those key issues because Democrats are the ones that won't enter the debate. We updated this post as Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI) talked with NPR reporters and editors. On Tuesday, Democrats won a special House election in western New York State in what has been a traditionally Republican district. They made Ryan's plan a centerpiece of their attack on the GOP candidate. Wednesday, the Senate \u2014 with five Republicans joining the majority \u2014 rejected Ryan's plan. Our friend Frank James over at It's All Politics will be analyzing Ryan's words later. Update at 10:24 a.m. ET. \"No Plans To Run For President\": Asked as the discussion came to a close whether he might mount a bid for the White House in 2012, Ryan says: \"I have no plans to run for president ... not really. Where I am right now, I can make a difference.\" Besides, he says, he has a young family and a good life in Wisconsin. Now might not be the time to be campaigning in New Hampshire and other early primary states, no matter how nice they are. Update at 10:22 a.m. ET. \"Negotiating With Ourselves\" And The Most Important Election In History: Of budget and health care talks with Democrats, Ryan says \"we're just negotiating with ourselves right now.\" And \"based upon the president's speeches and actions, it's my belief that he's not interested in ... patching those rifts.\" Update at 10:15 a.m. ET. More On The GOP Strategy And Taxes: If you aim safety net benefits at the poor and those in the middle incomes, and away from those with high incomes, Ryan says you \"target assistance where it belongs.\" Tax increases to pay for such programs, he argues, increases the burden on businesses and makes it harder for them to create jobs. Update at 10:10 a.m. ET. When Would We Get To Balance? The GOP plan doesn't produce balanced budgets in the foreseeable future (though it projects smaller deficits than under current forecasts). \"The primary reason,\" Ryan says, is that \"we want to keep the promise to seniors that their benefits will keep going. ... that is basically why we don't balance in the 10-year window.\" But, he argues, the plan keeps the deficit \u2014 relative to the size of the U.S. economy \u2014 below the danger zone. Update at 10:06 a.m. ET. Mortgage Deduction? Asked if his argument about tax reform and closing loopholes includes eliminating the deduction for mortgage interest, Ryan says \"we need to make a decision as a country as to what features of the tax code are necessary for growth and helpful ... and which are 'picking winners and losers.' \" Update at 10:04 a.m. ET. Raising Taxes? Is there any room for Republicans to agree with Democrats on some increases in taxes for those earning the highest incomes? Ryan says no. \"Here's the problem if you keep raising tax rates,\" he says. \"You slow down economic growth.\" To those who argue that taxes used to be higher and the economy did OK, he says, \"this is the 21st Century where tax competition matters so much more. ... Our competitors are lowering their tax rates.\" And on the argument that the nation has been cutting taxes but the economy hasn't benefited, he says that still doesn't justify higher taxes. \"The way you get higher tax revenues is through fundamental tax reform,\" he argues. That means taking away tax shelters and loopholes and making taxes more \"predictable.\" Update at 9:57 a.m. ET. More On Consumers: If Americans have more influence over the health care system because they have more control over how money is spent, Ryan argues, that should boost \"innovation, competition, efficiency [and], productivity.\" Update at 9:55 a.m. ET. Empowering Consumers: One of the basic points of the GOP health care proposal, Ryan says, is that consumers should have more power in the system. The idea: money shouldn't flow \"down\" from the government to health care providers, but \"should go through the person, a more powerful\" consumer. In other words, he says, consumers would have greater influence over choice and competition. Update at 9:50 ET. The Debt Limit Negotiations: Republicans are using talks over extending the federal debt ceiling to push their budget ideas. Ryan says the debt ceiling deadline offers \"an opportunity to get as much as we can on a serious down payment\" toward deficit and debt reduction. Update at 9:47 a.m. ET. No Regrets: With Democrats campaigning against his plan, does Ryan have any regrets over the proposal or the way it has been unveiled by his party? He says no: \"if we didn't propose these reforms, we would not have proposed a budget that got the debt under control.\" And, he adds, \"the country is way ahead of the political class\" on this subject. \"People are ready for these kinds of solutions ... and they want to see leaders out there fighting\" for these kinds of ideas. Update at 9:46 a.m. ET. Three Legs: The three legs of the GOP plan, Ryan says, are \"equal opportunity ... upward mobility ... [and] prosperity.\" Update at 9:42 a.m. ET. The GOP Strategy: The Republican proposals on Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security and other safety net programs, Ryan says, are based on the idea that those who are now retired or about to retire based their lives around current benefits. He says Republicans don't want to make changes that would affect those 54 and over. And, \"if, you reform it for people 54 and below ... you can keep it for the current generation.\" Update at 9:40 a.m. ET. Safety Net Is Going Bankrupt: \"You've got to get the safety net on a better path because it's going bankrupt,\" Ryan says. And he believes the government needs to be \"getting people into lives of self-sufficiency rather than [staying] on welfare.\" Update at 9:38 a.m. ET: \"Debt Is No. 1\" Problem: \"When you take a look at the problems our country is facing, debt is No. 1,\" Ryan says. \"The math is downright scary and the credit markets aren't going to keep on giving us cheap rates.\" Lawmakers, he says, have \"a moral obligation ... to put up solutions to fix this problem.\" Update at 9:35 a.m. ET: In introducing Ryan, NPR Senior Washington Editor Ron Elving says his plan is the \"most important domestic political event of 2011 so far.\"",

Patty Murray (D-WA) as he speaks to reporters after a budget vote Wednesday. The Democratic-run Senate voted down a controversial budget plan from the Republican-majority House that calls for turning Medicare into a voucherlike program for future beneficiaries. Senate Democrats forced their GOP colleagues Wednesday to vote on a House Republican budget, getting most of those Republicans on record as backing that budget's unpopular plan to privatize Medicare. Next week in the GOP-run House, a similar show vote is planned, asking lawmakers to raise the debt ceiling \u2014 with no strings attached \u2014 a move that could put Democrats in a tight spot. When House Republicans approved the spending plan drawn up by Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (R-WI) last month, Senate Majority leader Harry Reid (D-NV) made no move to bring it up for a vote. But that was before GOP House members went back to their districts and took a lot of heat from angry constituents for backing the plan, which would privatize Medicare a decade from now. Polls also show sizable majorities rejecting that plan. And when Democrat Kathy Hochul won a House seat in a special election in a solidly Republican district in upstate New   York on Tuesday, Democrats credited that upset victory to her Republican opponent's embrace of Ryan's Medicare proposal. 'All About Political Fodder' When Reid called for a vote Wednesday on bringing up the House budget in the Senate, he zeroed in on Medicare, saying, \"The Republican plan to kill Medicare is a plan to make the rich richer and the sick sicker.\" But the top Republican on the Budget Committee, Alabama's Jeff Sessions, said Democrats just don't get it. \"They think they can scare people by saying we're going to end Medicare, and they're going to vote on it,\" he said. \"And the vote in our Democratic politicians' mind is that 'we defend Medicare and all of you oppose Medicare.' \"The American people are getting too smart for that. I don't believe they're going to buy that path any longer.\" Republican Sen. Mike Johanns of Nebraska said it was simply campaign politics. \"These votes, I guarantee, are all about political fodder for next year's election season,\" he said. Five Republicans \u2014 two of them up for re-election next year \u2014 broke ranks with their party and voted with Democrats to block the Ryan budget, 57-40. Alaska's Lisa Murkowski was among them. \"The Medicare reform piece is not one that I am 100 percent with, maybe I'm ... looking for the perfect here, but anyway, I'm voting no,\" she said. Pointing to this week's victory in the New York House district, Sen. Patty Murray (D-WA), the Senate Democratic Campaign Committee chairwoman, said it's clear the GOP Medicare plan is giving pause to many other Republicans as well. \"I'm confident that Senate Democrats will be able to play offense in races across the country by remaining focused on Republican efforts to end Medicare in order to pay for an almost 30 percent tax-rate reduction for the wealthiest Americans and big corporations,\" she said. Ryan was dismissive about Senate Democrats putting his budget up for a vote before offering a plan of their own. \"It would be nice if they actually wrote a budget and tried to pass a budget,\" he said. \"I think it's more political theater than anything.\" Debt-Ceiling Vote That's exactly what House Democrats are saying about the Republicans' plan to hold a vote next week on raising the debt ceiling \u2014 without attaching any debt-reduction measures that would make such a vote politically safer for both sides. Democrats have backed off earlier demands for a vote simply on raising the debt limit, which has already been reached. But Rep. Jeb Hensarling (R-TX), the House Republican Conference chairman, said that vote is going ahead. \"This is something that the secretary of Treasury has requested. It's something that I think it's a 100, perhaps 150 different House Democrats have requested,\" he said. \"We don't believe that's the way to go, but I think it's important to let the president know that that is not where the support of Congress is. \"So this will let him know that the votes aren't there and hopefully hasten negotiations.\" New Jersey House Democrat Rob Andrews said Republicans are playing a very dangerous game with this vote. \"What you're going to get next week is a headline that says, 'U.S. House fails to raise debt ceiling,' \" he said. \"I don't know what global investors are going to make of that headline, but I don't think they should be reading it.\" When asked if he would vote to raise the debt ceiling, Andrews said he \"probably will.\" That, too, is a vote destined to become next year's campaign fodder.",

            "article_content": "The big question on Capitol Hill on Wednesday was how many Senate Republicans would ultimately vote on the unpopular House GOP budget proposal to privatize Medicare? The answer? Forty of the 47 Republicans stuck by their party to cast yes votes. No Democrats voted for the plan. Meanwhile, five Republicans joined the Democrats to vote against the proposal associated with House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan. Several Republican moderates had said before the vote they wouldn't be voting for Ryan's plan. Sens. Scott Brown of Massachusetts, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, both of Maine, said beforehand they would vote against the Ryan plan. Rand Paul of Kentucky said he would vote against the House bill also, but for the reason it didn't go far enough. We still need to track down the names of that fifth Republican senator and those who didn't vote.* Senate Democrats brought Ryan's plan up for a vote knowing they had the votes to block it but wanting to tie Republicans to the Ryan plan in the hopes that it will prove toxic come Election Day 2012. Democrats were buoyed in their hopes by the results of Tuesday's special election in New York's 26th Congressional District in which Democrat Kate Hochul beat Republican Jane Corwin in a district that has voted Republican with few exceptions since before the Civil War. In an attempt at tit for tat, Senate Republicans forced a vote on President Obama's dead-on-arrival proposed budget for fiscal 2012. Every senator, including Democrats, voted against it. (*Revision and extension of post: Sen. Lisa Murkowski, an Alaska Republican. made no secret before the vote that she wouldn't support the Ryan proposal, so the number of GOP nays didn't rise from the five who stated their opposition beforehand. The three senators who didn't vote were Republicans Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas, Pat Roberts of Kansas and Charles Schumer of New York. Also, it would have been a good idea if I had included the final tally in the original post. It was 57 against and 40 for the Ryan budget proposal.)",

In a victory certain to be read by many as a positive omen for House Democrats looking forward to the 2012 general elections and a warning for Republicans, Democrat Kathy Hochul won the closely watched special election to fill a vacant seat in a congressional district that until now has been reliably Republican. Late in the evening, Hochul was beating Republican Jane Corwin by 6 percentage points, 48 percent versus 42 percent with 87 percent of the precincts reporting. Tea Party movement candidate Jack Davis had 9 percent of the vote. The race was seen as a referendum on the House Republican Medicare plan associated with Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin that would privatize the popular entitlement program. Republicans have proposed giving future seniors money to purchase health insurance from private insurers. The proposed changes to the program have proved controversial, raising anxieties in many seniors and middle aged Americans, concerns Democrats have been quick to turn against Republicans. Hochul, Erie County clerk, was one of those Democrats, riding the Medicare issue all the way to Congress in a race in which she had initially trailed behind her Republican opponent. Corwin is a state assemblywoman. Denise Jewell Gee of The Buffalo News reports that in her victory speech, Hochul acknowledged the importance of the Medicare issue. From Gee's coverage: \"Yes, we are all future seniors, that's for sure. It's the future seniors they were going after, and we didn't like that did we?\" The vacancy in New York's 26th Congressional District, tucked in western New York between Buffalo and Rochester, occurred after the former Republican congressman, Chris Lee, summarily resigned. He left office after Gawker reported that a woman claimed he contacted her through a Craig's List personal and that the married Lee had sent her photos of himself in which he was shirtless. The race took on far more importance than the typical congressional election in a single district. Because it was seen to have become a proxy battle in the larger war over Medicare, both Republican and Democratic groups pumped big money into the race to purchase time for TV commercials. For Republicans, it was partly about holding on to a district that has been Republican, with few exceptions, since before the Civil War. So important was the outcome seen to be that the White House issued a statement from President Obama who is out of the country in Europe: I want to extend my congratulations to Congresswoman-elect Kathy Hochul for her  victory in New York's 26th Congressional District. Kathy and I both believe that  we need to create jobs, grow our economy, and reduce the deficit in order to  outcompete other nations and win the future.  Kathy has shown, through her  victory and throughout her career, that she will fight for the families and  businesses in western New York, and I look forward to working with her when she  gets to Washington. The victory was sure to give Democrats a much needed psychological boost after the pummeling they took in the 2010 mid-term elections because of the Affordable Care Act and the economy. But because it was a three-way race Republicans would be able to argue that Medicare wasn't the decisive factor in the outcome. Instead they could point to third-party candidate Davis, who took nearly a tenth of the vote, as a spoiler. Nevertheless, the result was sure to be interpreted by Democrats as a repudiation of the Republican agenda as surely as Republicans said the election of Sen. Scott Brown in January 2010 was a repudiation of the new health care law.",

            "article_content": "Democrat Kathy Hochul was elected to Congress on Tuesday in western New York's 26th District. She will replace a two-term Republican who resigned amid scandal. Outside money groups filled the airwaves in the 26th District with negative advertising as they prepare for big-budget campaigns in the 2012 elections. These outside money groups are separate from the national parties \u2014 never mind that they're run by former party operatives. They are also untethered from contribution limits when they raise money. In the district this spring, noncandidate spending totaled $2.25 million. The outside money groups easily overshadowed the national party committees. Eighty-seven percent of the spending was negative. Pro-Republican groups pounded Hochul; pro-Democratic groups hammered Republican Jane Corwin. Both sides whaled away at Tea Party candidate Jack Davis. Outside groups have spent nearly $2.3 million in New York's 26th Congressional District race. Below, a breakdown of the money, by group. (Note: Numbers are rounded) Pro-Republican Groups American Crossroads: $690,366 National Republican Congressional Committee: $424,678 U.S. Chamber of Commerce: $100,000 American Action Network: $94,694 National Right to Life Committee: $22,046 Independent Women's Voice: $14,250National Rifle Association: $7,392 American Conservative Strikeforce PAC: $3,700 Total: $1,357,126 Pro-Democratic Groups House Majority PAC: $371,252 Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee: $266,750 Communications Workers of America, Working Voices: $186,500 Service Employees International Union, Local 1199: $75,000 National Committee to Protect Social Security: $10,673 Working Families Party: $4,350 Planned Parenthood Action Fund: $2,060 Total: $916,585 Source: Sunlight Foundation, from Federal Election Commission data \"This is the first contest of 2012, and it's drawing a lot of interest from a lot of those players who are going to be key as we go through the 2012 election season,\" said Bill Allison, editorial director at the Sunlight Foundation, which tracked that outside money. That meant the groups used the 26th District to update their tactics. Take American Crossroads, a conservative powerhouse in the 2010 campaigns. Its spokesman, Jonathan Collegio, said that even in this staunchly Republican district, this special election wouldn't be a repeat of 2010 \"when any Republican \u2014 anybody with an R next to their name and a pulse \u2014 could have won an election. \"That same kind of environment does not exist right now, and it won't exist in 2012,\" Collegio said. So American Crossroads tried to sidestep the negative effects of the House Republicans' proposal to change Medicare. In its final ad of the campaign, it gave the election a local spin. Campaigns nowadays are also about technology, as Collegio noted. \"We engaged in some targeted Web advertising by ZIP code that we're experimenting with, and the results of those tactics will be seen once we get all the metrics back after the election,\" he said. Another pro-Republican group, American Action Network, augmented its traditional ground-war efforts Monday by spending $2,000 for a Facebook ad. As for Democrats, in 2010 they attacked the pro-Republican groups as conduits for corrupt big contributions. That didn't work. So, Democratic operatives now have three outside money groups of their own, including House Majority PAC. \"Once we got on the air in each of the media ads, we actually matched Crossroads dollar for dollar,\" said Alixandria Lapp, the group's director. In its final ad, House Majority PAC hit Republican Corwin on national, not local issues \u2014 and not just Medicare. To Allison, at the Sunlight Foundation, this looks much like the so-called soft-money era of the 1990s, when the national party committees solicited seven-figure checks from corporations, unions and the wealthy. \"It's just that it's not going to the political parties,\" he said. \"It's going to these outside groups that are run by people who used to run the political parties.\" The 1990s soft money was outlawed by the McCain-Feingold law. No such legislation is in the offing this year, and some of the outside money groups are building budgets in excess of $100 million.",

Recent polls have given Democrat Kathleen Hochul a small lead over Republican Jane Corwin in the district that's been reliably Republican. Here's the key point: even if Hochul should win, this race may need an asterisk because Tea Party candidate Jack Davis could prove to have been the decisive factor, siphoning Republican votes away from Corwin. Jerry Zremski of the Buffalo News provides the necessary caution: With three candidates running in a special election in which turnout is expected to be low, \"the dynamics of the race make it difficult to project nationwide political ramifications,\" said Nathan L. Gonzales, political editor for the Rothenberg Political Report. \"But it's going to get a lot of attention.\" The media and outside funders are investing so much in the race because \"it's the only game in town,\" said Larry J.

Pawlenty's announcement was no surprise. While other potential candidates have been coy or ambivalent, Pawlenty has been all-in for months, visiting the early states to lay the groundwork for a campaign. In Des Moines, he attacked President Obama, saying the president hasn't told the truth and that his policies have failed. But Pawlenty also echoed the unifying message Obama used when he ran for president in 2008. \"No president deserves to win an election by dividing the American people \u2014 picking winners and losers, protecting his own party's spending and cutting only the other guy's programs,\" he said. \"The truth is, we're all in this together. So we need to work together to get out of this mess.\" No 'White Knight'? Pawlenty opened his bid for the Republican nomination by promising to grow the economy, shrink the government, tell the truth and unite the country. He said he's willing to say \"no more bailouts\" to Wall Street and tell Iowans that subsidies for ethanol have to be phased out. He came out in favor of raising the retirement age for Social Security and means-testing Medicare. But he balked at endorsing the plan by Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI) to give seniors vouchers for health care. The Democratic National Committee greeted Pawlenty's announcement with an ad about his record in Minnesota, saying he \"eliminated the program that provides health care to 33,000 low-income residents\" and that he \"has systematically been cutting programs for the poor since he took office.\" Pawlenty's announcement follows decisions by Mitch Daniels, Haley Barbour, Mike Huckabee, Donald Trump, John Thune and Mike Pence not to run. Republican strategist Rick Wilson says many dissatisfied Republicans are looking for someone who doesn't exist. \"The grumbling comes from the fact that people want perfection,\" he says. \"They always want that white knight.\" Wilson says no candidate fires up the social conservative base or unites the Republican establishment. \"The field is becoming set. I think there's still room in the next 30 to 45 days for a few other people to poke their nose into it. But I don't think there's a lot of interest from anyone that draws the Republican base out as a cheering horde at this point,\" he says. Mitt Romney: The Front-Runner Most of the dissatisfaction is focused on the candidate who is as close to a front-runner as the GOP has at the moment, Mitt Romney. Wilson says the former Massachusetts governor has charisma and good ideas, and a campaign infrastructure. \"But there's one glaring error, and that is he doubled down on the individual mandate on Romneycare. And Republican base voters know that Barack Obama will beat Mitt Romney's head in on that single issue, destroy the morale of the Republican base, and therefore win the election. That's why a lot of Republicans have dismissed Mitt Romney as a serious candidate,\" Wilson says. Republican strategist Rich Galen, who used to work for Newt Gingrich, disagrees: \"I'm not a Romney supporter by any stretch, but at this point, I think it's fair to say that Gov. Romney is the front-runner until somebody knocks him off.\" Galen notes that earlier this month, Romney was able to raise $10 million in one day. \"That speaks volumes to the fact that a lot of people in the Republican Party \u2014 maybe not in the 150 people that talk about this stuff all day, but to a vast number of Republican primary voters \u2014 I think Gov. Romney is perfectly acceptable,\" Galen says. \"And I think if he gets the nomination, he will be a difficult guy for Obama to beat.\" That's hardly a consensus view among Republicans. The GOP presidential field may be set, but Republican voters are far from settled. And the desire is still strong for alternatives. There are several fantasy candidates out there \u2014 New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Texas Gov. Rick Perry, or former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, for example \u2014 but not a lot of time for any one of them to become a real-life contender.",

            "article_content": "Republicans are worried that they could lose one of their House seats in a special election Tuesday in western New York. The district has long been safe Republican territory. But the race has become a referendum on the GOP's controversial Medicare reform plan.  ROBERT SIEGEL, Host: Brian Mann of North Country Public Radio has the story. BRIAN MANN: Whether it's fair or not, sometimes one moment can define a political campaign. In New York's 26th Congressional District race that moment was captured earlier this month on a YouTube video. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO) U: Jack, why did you back out of the debate? MANN: Do you want to punch it out? U: Why? Why did you? Ow. Ow. Sir... MANN: Davis is apparently slapping at a cameraman who turns out to be the chief of staff at Jane Corwin. She's a Republican in the race. Political observers say this kind of muddle and melodrama have left Corwin vulnerable in a part of Western New York the Republicans usually dominate. MANN: It was the Republicans candidate's race to lose. And she may be losing it. MANN: The small city sits in that conservative heartland of the district, halfway between Buffalo and Rochester. Fischer thinks Republicans got sidetracked, going too negative and trying to convince voters that Davis isn't a legitimate conservative, with ads like this one. (SOUNDBITE OF A POLITICAL AD) U: Davis even said he had a hand in creating Nancy Pelosi's Democrat majority in Congress. MANN: But Republican State Assemblyman Steve Hawley points out that Davis has been hard to marginalize. He's a millionaire, wealthy enough to finance his own campaign. Davis is also better known in parts of the District than the Republican or the Democrat. MANN: He has better name recognition. And, as you know, that's very, very important. MANN: The Democratic candidate, Kathy Hochul pounced, accusing Jane Corwin of supporting an effort to dismantle the popular program. Here she is speaking during a debate on WGRZ-TV. MANN: And the truth is, it is a voucher program and Jane knows that. The Wall Street Journal even said that it ends Medicare as we know it. MANN: Corwin has scrambled to explain her views on Medicare, insisting that she would never vote for a plan that would impact those seniors who now rely on the program. MANN: Actually, Kathy is the one with the scare tactics, because the reality is this does not eliminate Medicare. MANN: But even many Republicans say the Corwin campaign handled the issue clumsily. And Dan Fischer says questions about Medicare put a key voting bloc back in play. MANN: The demographics of this town definitely tend to be older, and nowhere is it more pronounced, Medicare, as the third rail of politics than right here. MANN: If Republican leaders here are worried, so our rank-and-file conservative voters like Janet Burheit, an attorney from Buffalo. A Corwin supporter, she is dismayed that Democrats might pull off an upset. MANN: Yeah, I think Kathy Hochul might win. MANN: Do you think the Republicans have - have kind of - I mean they... MANN: Screwed it up. MANN: Screwed it up? MANN: I think they might have. MANN: For NPR News, I'm Brian Mann in New York.

Tim Pawlenty, March 2011.\n                \n                    \n                    Steve Pope/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty, March 2011. The day that Tim Pawlenty officially announced that he's entering the hunt for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination, seems as good a day as any to ask a Pawlenty presidency might look like? In his announcement speech in Des Moines Monday, the former two-term Minnesota governor offered that he would confront tough issues with an honesty he alleges President Obama has failed to. President Obama's policies have failed. But more than that, he won't even tell us the truth about what it's really going to take to get out of the mess we're in... I am going to tell you the truth. The truth is, Washington's broken... Leadership in a time of crisis isn't about telling people what you think they want to hear, it's about telling the truth. In both his video announcement and speech, the genial Republican, who  has had trouble finding his footing in early preference polls, portrayed himself  as an antidote to three years of \"fancy speeches\" - a truth-teller with a blue  collar background and willingness to tackle the country's big  problems. But what would a Pawlenty presidency bring based on where he has stood on the issue over the years? We took a  quick look at his past positions on issues ranging form the debt limit to same  sex marriage. Entitlement Reform and  Spending Pawlenty has called for linking increasing in the debt  ceiling with \"hard choices about discretionary spending.\" He has said that  entitlement programs \"need to be dramatically reformed,\" and are unsustainable  in their present form. He has championed means testing for Social Security's  cost of living increases as well as raising the retirement age - \"indexed for  new entrants.\" Means testing, he said, would mean smaller Social  Security increases for the wealthy - a proposal he has characterized as \"not  ideal,\" but the best among a slew of bad choices. Pawlenty has advocated \"capping and block-granting\"  Medicaid payment to states, a proposal similar to that put forward by GOP Rep.  Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, as well as \"moving\" Medicare to a  pay-for-performance model. Health Care Overhaul Pawlenty has asserted that health care overhaul  legislation passed by Congress last year \"violates the U.S. Constitution.\" Like  many opponents of the law, he argues that the requirement that individuals  purchase health insurance coverage is a federal government \"power  grab.\" He argued in a Washington Post opinion piece this year  that federal reforms and cost containment should be based on patient incentive  programs, pay for performance, liability reform, interstate health-care  insurance and modernization of health insurance. While governor, he rejected federal money for the  implementation of the new health care overhaul, but accepted $263 million in  federal Medicaid funding. After forbidding state agencies from accepting health  care grant money, he said that \"to the fullest extent possible, we need to keep  Obamacare out of Minnesota.\" Social Issues An evangelical Christian, Pawlenty opposes same-sex  marriage, and as governor vetoed legislation that would have allowed local  authorities to determine who could receive domestic partner  benefits. \"I firmly believe that marriage is between a man and a  women,\" he said recently. He has endorsed mandated waiting periods for women  seeking legal abortion, and has participated in March for Life  rallies. His first commissioner of education in Minnesota expressed  support for teaching creationism, and Pawlenty punted in a recent debate when  asked if he equated that theory with scientific theories of evolution. What and  how to teach the subject, he insisted, should be left to local  control. In an interview this year with Christianity Today  magazine, Pawlenty said he is \"proud to be labeled a fiscal conservative and a  social conservative.\" \"I've been pro-life my whole life,\" he said. \"I've been  in favor of traditional marriage.\" Climate Change Pawlenty has been dinged by conservatives for his past  support of initiatives to reduce carbon emissions, as well as a regional  cap-and-trade proposal. He essentially apologized for those views at a recent  candidates' debate in South  Carolina, saying he made a  mistake. In a much-cited 2008 interview with Human Events, at a time Pawlenty was  considered on Sen. John McCain's short-list for vice president, he cited his  evangelical faith as a guidepost on the  environment. \"I believe in the Bible, God instructs us to take good  care and be good stewards of what He has given us,\" he said, \"and that certainly  includes our environment and natural resources.\" But, by then, he was already saying he had determined  that cap-and-trade is \"the wrong approach.\" The primary answer to reducing position, he said, \"will  revolve around breakthroughs in technology and  innovation.\"",

            "article_content": "Mitt Romney has a dubious honor as the target of what's being called the first TV ad of the 2012 presidential campaign. The ad is by Priorities USA, a Democratic group that is viewed as an independent fundraising organization even though it was formed by a couple of former Obama White House aides, Bill Burton and Sean Sweeney. The ad is a twofer in how it hits Romney. It thwacks him for not only supporting the controversial House GOP plan to essentially privatize Medicare but also seeks to reinforce doubts among Republican voters about Romney's steadfastness on issues. It short, it raises the flip flopper issue. Actually, the ad also seems meant to damage Newt Gingrich and South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, too. It has her defending the House GOP Medicare plan which is unpopular with many seniors, a fair number of whom live in her state. The ad, unveiled to coincide with Romney's trip to South Carolina over the weekend, opens with a photo of Gingrich and mentions his now famous criticism of the plan by Wisconsin Republican, Rep. Paul Ryan. It then shows a photo of Haley who criticized Gingrich for knocking Ryan's plan. Then it moves on to Romney. \"Mitt Romney says he's on the same page as Paul Ryan who wrote the plan to essentially end Medicare. But with Mitt Romney you have to wonder, which page is he on today?\" the narrator asks. Romney's campaign hit back in a fundraising email, rebuking Obama's supporters for going negative and for allegedly trying to distract voters from the high unemployment numbers and generally unimpressive economic recovery. An excerpt from the fundraising email that was reproduced by Ben Smith at Politico: Just this morning, the New York Times posted a story, \"Group Unleashes Early Ad Against Romney,\" about President Obama's reelection campaign machine starting attack ads in South Carolina against Governor Romney. All the while, South Carolina is hurting. Like many states suffering from the failed policies of the Obama administration, the Palmetto State has seen 3,800 more jobs in April disappear than in the previous month; and they are currently experiencing 9.8% unemployment. After campaigning so famously on \"hope\" and \"change,\" the President and his team have now resorted to governing on fear and misdirection. Already, former Obama aides and union leaders have been commissioned to lead outside political attack groups \u2014 which aren't limited in the amount of high-dollar donations they can receive \u2014 and President Obama himself plans to raise an additional $1 billion.",

            "article_content": "Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich speaks to local party activists Thursday in Waterloo, Iowa.   Gingrich says his campaign is alive and well despite an angry response by some Republicans to earlier comments he made about a House Republican plan to dramatically change Medicare.\n                \n                    \n                    Charlie Neibergall/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Newt Gingrich's run for president has had a rocky start, and he has been engaged in damage control all week. On Sunday, he infuriated fellow Republicans when he called House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan's plan for revamping Medicare \"radical.\" Gingrich was campaigning in Iowa Thursday, and a standing-room-only crowd turned out at the Marshalltown Public Library to hear the former House speaker aim rhetorical bombs at the president. \"President Obama is the most successful food stamp president in history,\" Gingrich said. \"Forty-seven million Americans are on food stamps. I would like to be the most successful paycheck president in history.\" That kind of verbal flame-throwing is what got Gingrich in trouble Sunday when he attacked Ryan's Medicare plan on Meet the Press, calling it \"right-wing social engineering.\" \"I don't think imposing radical change from the right or the left is a very good way for a free society to operate,\" Gingrich said. From Flame-Throwing To Diplomacy Gingrich has been backpedaling all week. He apologized directly to Ryan, held conference calls with conservative bloggers and even explained himself on Rush Limbaugh's show. By Thursday, when the House Republican plan to give future Medicare beneficiaries vouchers to buy private insurance came up, Gingrich was careful \u2014 diplomatic, even. \"We need a better Medicare program,\" Gingrich said. \"I think Paul Ryan has begun that conversation.\" Rich Galen, who worked for Gingrich when he was speaker, says the grandiose overstatement is a Gingrich signature. \"Here's what we know about Newt \u2014 that when the adrenaline starts flowing, he will go back to his basic stance, which is to state his position in the starkest possible terms, drawing the most broad differences between his position and his opponent's position,\" Galen says. Only in this case, his opponent was another Republican, whose Medicare plan got the votes of all but four Republicans in the House. That crossed a line for many conservatives in Washington,  D.C. 'Newt Being Newt ... A Great Idea Man' In Dubuque,  Iowa, Russell Furman confronted Gingrich: \"Mr. Gingrich, what you just did to Paul Ryan is unforgivable.\" \"I didn't do anything to Paul Ryan,\" Gingrich answered. \"Yes, you did,\" Furman shot back. \"You undercut him and his allies in the House.\" Gingrich tried to respond, but Furman cut him off, saying, \"You're an embarrassment to our party.\" \"Well, I'm sorry you feel that way,\" Gingrich responded. I wish one of the people who was predicting my demise would just come out and spend a day or two on the road, and they'll understand. The pundits actually don't decide the election. The American people do. And I'm out here with the American people, and the water feels just fine. GOP presidential hopeful Newt Gingrich Gingrich has few defenders inside the Beltway, where Republicans seem to have run out of patience with his behavior. But in Ames,  Iowa, Gingrich spoke to another packed house, where Polly Bailey and Jim Lohr found him both frustrating and impressive. \"He's Newt being Newt,\" Bailey said. \"He's a great idea man. I don't know, it takes a light touch if you're going to govern.\" \"Newt is brilliant,\" Lohr said. \"There is no question about that. Sometimes he needs to be more careful about how he phrases things.\" Gingrich himself says he knows voters will decide whether he has the discipline and judgments to be president. In an interview Thursday, he was selling his liabilities as an asset. \"If you are an ideal-oriented political figure, if you're somebody who passionately believes that we need a national conversation, and it has to be real, and it has to touch things that are dangerous, you're occasionally going to get in trouble,\" Gingrich said. For many Republicans, the unforced errors say a lot about Gingrich himself. But for Democrats, the reaction to Gingrich's comments say even more about the GOP and its determination to dismantle Medicare. 'The Water Feels Just Fine' Gingrich was clearly trying to recast the Medicare debate. He knows the Ryan plan is unpopular with seniors. He argues that any changes in Medicare should be voluntary \u2014 seniors should be given the option of using a voucher to buy health insurance. \"If he was saying those same things as Newt Gingrich, senior thinker for Republicans and conservatives, then he could lay those things out,\" said Rich Galen, the former staffer. \"Saying it as Newt Gingrich, looking for votes in Iowa, and looking for support in New Hampshire, it takes on a completely different tone.\" Gingrich has been a senior thinker for conservatives in the years since he was speaker, and there is no reason he can't continue to be. \"The role as a candidate may not be the correct role for him,\" Galen said. Gingrich, however, says he has no intention of quitting. He's had overflow crowds in Dubuque and Mason City. \"I wish one of the people who was predicting my demise would just come out and spend a day or two on the road, and they'll understand,\" Gingrich said. \"The pundits actually don't decide the election. The American people do. And I'm out here with the American people, and the water feels just fine.\" Indeed, this weekend, Gingrich will be back on the Sunday talk shows, explaining himself again.",

            "article_content": "Newt Gingrich's early days as a presidential candidate are reminding a lot of people of his time as speaker of the House, angering conservatives with comments about Paul Ryan and then revealing his wife's enormous credit line at Tiffany's.  ROBERT SIEGEL, host: The presidential campaign of former House speaker Newt Gingrich is barely a week old, but it's already beset with an entire campaign's worth of controversy. As NPR national political correspondent Don Gonyea reports, most of that controversy has been caused by words from the mouth of the candidate himself. DON GONYEA: The new candidate kicked off his first big road trip this week in the key state of Iowa, and things seemed normal enough when he chatted with a reporter from a Cedar Rapids TV station, KGAN, on Monday. Mr. NEWT GINGRICH (Former Speaker of the House, Republican, Georgia): Iowa has a great tradition of listening carefully, asking questions and not making their minds up too early. So I'll be back I guess again and again. GONYEA: The early days of any big campaign in Iowa or New Hampshire are often mundane, and maybe that's what Gingrich was hoping for, until something he'd said a day earlier on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" suddenly came back to haunt him. Mr. GINGRICH: I don't think right-wing social engineering is any more desirable than left-wing social engineering. GONYEA: That statement might not have been a problem in another context, but Gingrich had just been asked about the budget proposal of GOP rising star Paul Ryan, the House budget chairman who wants to change Medicare for senior citizens to a system of vouchers and private insurance. Gingrich went on to say... Mr. GINGRICH: I don't think imposing radical change from the right or the left is a very good way for a free society to operate. GONYEA: It didn't take long for conservatives, many of whom greatly admire Ryan's plan, to fire back, putting the candidate and campaign on the defensive. Headlines today told the story. Unidentified Woman: Politico: Newt Gingrich campaign fights for its life. Unidentified Man #1: National Review: Tea Partiers furious at Gingrich. Unidentified Woman: Des Moines Register: Newt Gingrich struggles to stay afloat after Medicare comments. Unidentified Man #1: The Daily Caller: Newt Gingrich to Paul Ryan: I'm sorry. GONYEA: Some prominent Republican officeholders, including House majority leader Eric Cantor and South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, rebuked Gingrich in interviews on talk radio and cable TV. And back in Iowa, Gingrich found himself confronted by an irate citizen in Dubuque, who called the candidate an embarrassment. Unidentified Man #2: What you just did to Paul Ryan is unforgivable. Mr. GINGRICH: I didn't do anything to Paul Ryan. Unidentified Man #2: Yes, you did. You undercut him and his allies in the House. Mr. GINGRICH: No, I said... Unidentified Man #2: You're an embarrassment to our party... GONYEA: It got worse last night at a book-signing in Minneapolis, where a protester tossed a bag full of glitter all over the candidate. While cable news outlets and the Web were full of a story about Gingrich's wife Callista having a bill at Tiffany's, the famous jewelers, for between 250 and 500 thousand dollars. In an interview on Fox News, he declined to explain the tab at Tiffany's, but he has been spending a lot of time explaining his remarks about Medicare, even apologizing to Congressman Ryan. Mark McKinnon, an adviser to the presidential campaigns of George W. Bush and John McCain, says it's a hall-of-fame week for Gingrich but in the worst way. Mr. MARK McKINNON (Republican Presidential Adviser): We predicted that Newt would shake things up, but we had no idea that he would self-immolate within 48 hours. GONYEA: McKinnon says it's a reminder of how important discipline is. He says this week is also a reminder that Gingrich, who left office in 1999, is rusty on the campaign trail. Mr. McKINNON: And that makes it a lot harder when you, you know, fall flat on your face right out of the gates. He's going to be pretty bruised up, and I'm not saying that he can't resurrect himself and maybe go the distance. GONYEA: But McKinnon says this week made Gingrich's already long odds that much longer. Don Gonyea, NPR News. Copyright \u00a9 2011 NPR.  All rights reserved.

It's a week since Newt Gingrich launched his presidential campaign and already his political obituaries are springing up all over the place like the dandelions in my yard. That the obituaries are happening isn't a surprise, mind you. Gingrich wasn't exactly a frontrunner in the race for the Republican presidential nomination. He was already a candidate with issues, to put it politely, before his most recent gaffe. Any presidential candidate for whom you can get nearly 67,000 hits in nine-hundredths of a second by googling his surname and the phrase \"too much baggage\" (actually, I expected more) probably will have political obits written about him well before the presidential primaries are over. But Gingrich didn't get to the one-week mark of his campaign before apparently fatally wounding it. Heck, he didn't even get through the weekend that followed his announcement before essentially being written off after he dismissed the Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI) and the House GOP's plan to turn Medicare into a voucher program as \"right-wing social engineering.\" Charles Krauthammer, the medical doctor and conservative pundit, pronounced him politically dead Sunday evening, which makes it official since, again, Krauthammer is a physician. KRAUTHAMMER: \"He's done. He didn't have a big chance from the beginning, but now it's over.\" Conservative media luminaries Rush Limbaugh, George Will and William Bennett evidently all agree with Krauthammer. Meanwhile, the practicing politicians appear to be saying the same thing. Politico quotes the House Majority Leader, Rep. Eric Cantor, who presumably has a good feel for what his GOP members are thinking and saying about Gingrich: \"Many have said now he's finished,\" (House Majority Leader Eric) Cantor said in a radio interview, stopping short of endorsing that analysis but calling Gingrich's comments \"a tremendous misspeak.\" Perhaps most tellingly, not a single prominent Republican has rallied to Gingrich's defense \u2013 a testament to the regard in which Gingrich is held by much of the Beltway GOP establishment. Nice touch by Cantor, using the \"many have said\" formulation to deliver the coup de grace without getting his hands dirty. Speaking of hands, that was one awkwardly long handshake, wasn't it, between Gingrich and the Iowa Republican who told the former House speaker he was an \"embarrassment to our party\" and to \"get out\" of the race? Gingrich has apologized and tried to undo the damage. But there's really no way to say sorry from beyond the grave, political or real. Instead of being on an inexorable path to the glittering prize of the GOP nomination, all he appears to be getting is glitter. Or bling, according to his wife Callista's congressional disclosure form (she was a Capitol Hill staffer) in which she reported that her husband owed as much as $500,000 to Tiffany's. Despite all the political obits, if any group of people hopes the never-boring Gingrich hangs in there and stays the course, it's political reporters. The reason's go without saying; he's good copy.",

Who knew Newt Gingrich would enter the race for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination and immediately become the Democrats' not-so-secret weapon against the House GOP's Medicare proposal? But that's what Gingrich essentially did during his appearance on Meet the Press Sunday. He shot down the Republican plan to give future seniors a set amount of money with which to buy private health insurance instead of having Medicare serve as a single payer as it has since 1965. Here's Gingrich's exchange with NBC News' David Gregory: DAVID GREGORY: Do you think that Republicans ought to buck the public opposition  and really move forward to completely change Medicare? Turn it into a voucher  program where you give seniors some premium support and-- so that they can go  out and buy private insurance? NEWT GINGRICH: No. I don't think right  wing social engineering is any more desirable than left wing social engineering.  I don't think imposing radical change from the right or the left is a very good  way for a free society to operate. I think we need a national conversation to  get to a better Medicare system with more choices for seniors... DAVID  GREGORY: But not what Paul Ryan is suggesting, which is completely changing  Medicare? NEWT GINGRICH: I think that that is too big a jump. I think  what you want to have is a system where people voluntarily migrate to better  outcomes, better solutions, better options. ... I'm against Obamacare, which is  imposing radical change. And I would be against a conservative imposing radical  change. As you might expect, Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI), the House Budget Committee chairman who gets credit for the Republican plan which was part of his 2012 budget proposal, was not amused. The Hill reports on Ryan's reaction on a conservative talk show Monday: Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) took a swipe Monday at Republican presidential candidate Newt Gingrich after the former House Speaker criticized hiss proposed Medicare reforms. \"With allies like that, who needs the left?\" Ryan told guest host Raymond Arroyo on conservative talker Laura Ingraham's radio show. Gingrich's statement now allows Democrats to argue that their opposition to the Ryan Medicare plan isn't reflexively liberal because no less a conservative than Gingrich agrees with them that it's extreme. ThinkProgress.org notes that Gingrich in 1995 made a proposal that was very similar to Ryan's. Of course, that was 16 years ago, so Gingrich could always say that was then, this is now. ThinkProgress also points to a Weekly Standard piece offering other examples of times Gingrich switched positions on issues, known in the vernacular as flip-flopping. A politician's allowed to change his mind, isn't he?",

Ron Paul waits to speak at a news conference in April in Des Moines, Iowa. NPR has been profiling some of the Republicans who are considering a presidential run in 2012, to find out what first sparked their interest in politics. Read more of those profiles. Go to any Ron Paul event and it strikes you immediately: What's up with all the young people? The 75-year-old Texas congressman packs halls on college campuses. His campaign volunteers often look too young to shave. And even at a recent New   York City book signing, it's surprising how many teenagers and 20-somethings are lined up for an autograph, clutching Paul's new book, Liberty Defined. Sixteen-year-old Rob Gray says the age of the crowd doesn't seem odd to him. It's \"the old canard of the young being more open-minded than the old,\" he says. Paul, the world's most unlikely teen idol, is running again for president. A supporter holds a sign as Paul speaks in Des Moines, Iowa, in April.\n                \n                    \n                    Charlie Neibergall/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption A supporter holds a sign as Paul speaks in Des Moines, Iowa, in April. He failed to reach the White House twice before: In 1988, running as a Libertarian, he got less than 1 percent of the vote; in 2008, he made a losing shot at the Republican nomination. But don't expect the man to reinvent himself. Paul is nothing if not consistent. He still wants to shut down the Federal Reserve; still wants to slash the size of government and bring the troops home. Already in the first Republican primary debate, he restated his long-held belief that drugs should be legalized. It's a unique set of beliefs for a congressman, but that's why his fans love him. At the New York   City event, the young people keep packing into the bookstore. The line starts in the children's section, moves through self-help and recovery, past the memoirs and along the great ideas bookshelf. When Paul arrives, he sits down in the World History section, and his bushy eyebrows go up in surprise. Paul says it still amazes him when kids want to talk about the Federal Reserve. \"When I was in high school and college, at the age many of those young people are now, I didn't have much interest in politics at all,\" Paul says. \"I was probably more interested in trying to get into medical school.\" In 1988, then-Libertarian Party presidential candidate Ron Paul speaks at a rally at Boston's Faneuil Hall.\n                \n                    \n                    Peter Southwick/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Looking back at his youth, you can see the spark that drove Paul is the same as the one that inspires his fans: a desire for a unified philosophy to make sense of the world. But for Paul, the ideological search wouldn't come until he was in medical school in the 1950s at Duke University. He was looking for a hobby when he wasn't studying. He didn't want to golf, he says. But he loved to read. Paul seemed especially taken by a book his mother gave him: Doctor Zhivago by Boris Pasternak. You can see how the book would resonate: It's about a young, idealistic doctor who wants nothing to do with politics until he is co-opted into the Russian Revolution. \"I was intrigued with this whole idea of Communism and the terrible conditions in Russia and the way Zhivago had to put up with this,\" Paul says. It was all about the value of individual liberty. Soon Paul found an economic theory with the same message. He devoured books by the Austrian economists F.A. Hayek and Ludwig von Mises, writing about free-market capitalism. \"It was sort of like a game about how the monetary system worked,\" he says. By then you could probably call Paul a libertarian. But he still shunned politics. He just wanted to be a doctor. He moved to Texas and delivered babies. Still, Paul quietly lived his principles. He would treat any patient who came to him, but he wouldn't accept federal payments like Medicare and Medicaid. He didn't try to change the world \u2014 until the world changed on him. \"I remember that day very clearly: Aug. 15, 1971,\" Paul says. \"It was a Sunday night when the announcement came.\" Texas Republican Rep. Ron Paul (fourth from right), Idaho Republican Rep. George Hansen (left) and other members of Congress gather around a truck loaded with 44,300 simulated gold bricks on April 25, 1979, in Washington to indicate their opposition to the estimated $4.1 billion it would cost U.S. taxpayers to give away the Panama Canal.\n                \n                    \n                    Daugherty/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Texas Republican Rep. Ron Paul (fourth from right), Idaho Republican Rep. George Hansen (left) and other members of Congress gather around a truck loaded with 44,300 simulated gold bricks on April 25, 1979, in Washington to indicate their opposition to the estimated $4.1 billion it would cost U.S. taxpayers to give away the Panama Canal. President Nixon addressed the nation and said he was suspending the convertibility of the dollar into gold. The gold standard was over. For an Austrian-economics buff like Paul, this was akin to declaring the end of the world. He had learned to hate the idea of paper money backed only by the promises of the government. He thought it would lead to massive inflation. But even hearing Nixon didn't push Paul to run for office. The real spark came the day after the U.S. left the gold standard, when Paul realized that most of the world didn't seem to care. \"The stock market went up a record amount as a consequence of this disastrous announcement,\" Paul remembers. \"And my interpretation was, my Lord, what's going on here? They are doing everything wrong, and everybody loves it.\" So Paul ran for Congress in 1974 because, he says, laughing, \"Who wanted to hear me talk about economics while practicing medicine?\" Paul lost but later won a seat from his coastal Texas district in a special election in 1976. In the following years, Paul would move in and out of Congress. He was elected 11 more times. But he never got the U.S. any closer to returning to the gold standard. He was always a lonely voice in Congress, and still is. Paul rails against government spending \u2014 and the budget goes up. He argues against wars \u2014 and the troops keep fighting. He calls for the legalization of drugs \u2014 and nothing happens. Even Paul jokes about his lousy track record at changing the world. But when he announced his third run for president, he said perhaps the world is finally coming around to his way of thinking. It turns out that some young people were listening. At the New York book signing, every 20-something remembers their Ron Paul spark.   For most, it was discovering YouTube videos of Paul's two earlier runs for president. It's not hard to see the attraction for a college student. They've just left home. They don't want anyone, not their parents, not the government, telling them what to do. \"I think it's just the concept of freedom, being able to choose what you want with your life,\" says 26-year-old Kenneth Christiansen. But there's something more that explains Paul's following. Every young person fears that getting older means a life full of compromises. A few at the book signing even mentioned that someday they may have to support a candidate with a better chance of winning, but not now. Gray, the teenager, says Paul gives him hope \u2014 \"that not everyone is a sellout; not everyone is controlled by special interests. There are people who still stick to their principles.\" And in that idealistic way, you can say that Paul never grew up.",

Newt Gingrich, the 67-year-old former Republican House speaker, in an  announcement on Twitter, said he intends to run for president of the United States. No surprise: Gingrich's spokesman two days earlier had announced that his boss was going to make it official, becoming only the third among a slew of would-be GOP candidates to issue an unqualified \"I'm in\" statement. A singular figure, the thrice-married Gingrich has thrilled, disappointed and confounded supporters and critics alike since he left elective politics in 1999. He brings to the GOP nomination race all that, plus the attendant name recognition and network of big money. But interviews with Republican activists and strategists in caucus and primary states where the candidates will first be tested next year suggest that while the former Georgia congressman has a path to success, he also has a whole lot of convincing to do \u2014 no matter who else announces a run. The early, defining path runs through Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina. \"I want to see conservatives get behind a game-changing candidate,\" says Stephen Brown, a conservative activist and former Greenville, S.C., GOP county chairman. \"I think Mr. Gingrich is a fine gentleman and he'll be a formidable candidate,\" Brown says. But a game-changer? \"That case,\" he says, \"has yet to be made.\" Gingrich's run comes nearly 17 years after he was hailed as a party savior for engineering the Republican takeover of the House after four decades of Democratic rule. But he left office several years later, humbled and embarrassed after forcing a politically damaging government shutdown and overseeing his party's unexpectedly poor showing in the 1998 midterm elections. He has since written scores of books, produced documentaries, and expanded his influence through his health policy center and his American Solutions for Winning the Future, which has most notably advocated efforts to expand domestic oil production. He has also doled out money to help high-profile social conservative causes, including a successful effort to defeat Iowa high court judges who rejected the state's ban on same-sex marriage. But though Gingrich has been consistently counted among those in the first tier (though maybe barely) of potential Republican challengers angling to take on President Obama in 2012, Gingrich's long political history and very public positions on issues ranging from immigration to the environment have given critics ample targets. Iowa Caucuses: The First Test In Iowa, where GOP caucus attendees are predominantly evangelical, conservative Christians \u2014 they voted for former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, an ordained Baptist minister, in 2008 \u2014 Gingrich has already been atoning for the ugly ends of his first two marriages. His third, to current wife Callista, began as an affair while he was still married. \"I sat in a meeting with him with some Iowa pastors,\" says Steve Scheffler, president of the influential conservative Iowa Faith and Freedom Coalition. \"He alluded to the fact that there were some things in his past, things that were not good.\" \"But I think that most caucus-goers are like me: more concerned about what they're doing now,\" he said. \"Politicians and human beings make mistakes, and I think he's addressed it.\" Gingrich's conversion to Catholicism may have helped him with the religious right. He also has the backing of Iowa's statehouse majority leader. Gingrich's policy wonkishness is an asset in Iowa, where voters expect to meet their candidates up close and personal, and pepper them with specific questions. Though it would be a stretch to suggest the former speaker could win the Iowa test \u2014 especially if next-door politicians former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty and Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-MN) get into the race \u2014 the peculiarities of the caucus system may work to his benefit. There's a lot of horse trading that goes on caucus night, and there are times when being a voter's second or third choice can translate into good things for candidates like Gingrich. \"If he makes a concentrated effort in Iowa, there's the possibility he could end up in the top three,\" Scheffler says. The best news for the new candidate right now in Iowa? \"I don't think more than 5 percent of caucus-goers have the foggiest idea of who their choice is,\" he said. New Hampshire Challenge With former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney expected to run for the GOP nomination again and expected to do well in New Hampshire, strategists there are wondering who else will come on strong. \"Romney is clearly ahead, but there's going to be an alternative to Romney,\" says former New Hampshire Republican Chairman Fergus Cullen. \"But will it be a mainstream alternative? Or an alternative alternative?\" Romney was the mainstream alternative to eventual GOP nominee, Sen. John McCain, in the state's 2008 primary, which McCain won. But cultural conservative Pat Buchanan was the \"alternative alternative\" in the 1996 primary, defeating eventual nominee Sen. Bob Dole. \"Will the alternative be Michele Bachmann or Ron Paul, or will it be a mainstream Republican?\" Cullen said. Paul is the Texas congressman and Tea Party favorite who ran for president in 2008. The question now among New Hampshire Republicans is whether Gingrich will consider the state critical to his strategy, particularly since he's putting energy in Iowa with evangelicals and religious conservatives. \"Gingrich will have the resources to run a good campaign, and he has good name recognition, but the question is whether he's played out or not,\" Cullen says. A recent Suffolk University poll had Romney preferred by 35 percent of respondents. The other potential candidates are all at 8 percent or less, with Gingrich at 3 percent. South Carolina Imperative What Republicans in South Carolina would really like is for their Sen. Jim DeMint, a Tea Party favorite, to throw his favorite-son hat in the ring. But DeMint has dismissed the notion. So his base is agitating for a candidate who will stand up to GOP party leadership, says Brown, the lawyer and former Greenville County chairman. Gingrich could be the game-changing candidate South Carolina Republicans are hungering for, but the prospect seems a bit far-fetched. Even Gov. Nikki Haley said last week in Atlanta that the former congressman has to prove that his \"ideas are still relevant \u2014 to see if he has new ideas that connect with people.\" Gingrich is likely to take heat for his past support of a guest worker program for illegal immigrants, for example. And for his endorsement of a GOP-backed program that expanded Medicare prescription drug coverage at great cost. Brown, who supported Huckabee in 2008, says that many, like him, are still looking at the field and have not made any commitments. He hopes it stays that way until support solidifies around one candidate. \"I would like to see a large group of conservatives get behind a game-changing candidate,\" he says. Conservatives like Brown say they want to avoid divisions that in 2008 led to McCain emerging as the state's primary winner, with conservative votes divided between Huckabee and former Tennessee Sen. Fred Thompson. A recent poll by Winthrop University of state Republicans showed Huckabee and Romney leading with 18 percent and 16 percent respectively; Gingrich polled fifth with 8 percent, behind businessman and reality television star Donald Trump and former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin. Nevada Advantage Jon Ralston, the Nevada political columnist and commentator, says that Romney is the only GOP candidate who has an organization ready to go in the Silver State. \"But it's way too early to tell anything definitively because we don't know who's in the race and who's not,\" he said. The biggest thing that Gingrich has going for him right now in Nevada, Ralston says, is Sheldon Adelson, the 77-year-old billionaire who has long supported Gingrich and his efforts. \"He has money. He has operatives,\" Ralston said. \"And he loves Gingrich.\" The drawback? \"The Republican Party here is not the well-oiled machine that the Democrats are,\" he says. \"The central question in this state is whether Sheldon Adelson is going to fund a campaign apparatus for Gingrich,\" he says. A recent Public Policy Poll showed Romney preferred by 24 percent of those surveyed, trailed by Trump at 16 percent, Gingrich at 11 percent, and Huckabee at 10 percent.",

The special election to fill New York's vacant 26th Congressional District is being widely viewed as the latest test of Republican and Democratic political fortunes. The Western New York State district, has been reliably Republican. Until earlier this year it was represented by Republican Chris Lee who got 74 percent of the vote last November. Lee famously resigned after Gawker revealed that the married lawmaker responded to a listing on Craigslist by sending a beefcake photo of himself to a woman.

Now the seat doesn't look so reliably red. A recent Public Policy Polling survey showed Democrat Kathy Hochul leading Republican Jane Corwin 35 percent to 31 percent. Getting blamed for this, at least publicly by Democrats, is the Medicare piece of the budget plan of Rep. Paul Ryan, the Wisconsin Republican House Budget Committee chair. His proposal, which would have private insurers essentially take over Medicare, has taken what should have been a cakewalk and made it competitive. If that could happen in New York's 26th, it could happen elsewhere, the thinking goes. If Democrats were to pick up this seat on May 24 it would be: one) a major embarrassment for Republicans and two) a significant moral victory for Democrats. Republicans are determined to keep that from happening. So the GOP is pumping significant money into the race. American Crossroads which was formed by Karl Rove, who needs no introduction, says it is spending $350,000 on television ads this week. The Washington Post and Politico report that Republicans intend to spend $650,000 on ads by the time of the election next week. In another attempt to turn things around for Corwin, a state assemblywoman, House Speaker John Boehner on Monday visited the district which lies between Rochester in the east and Buffalo to the west.",

Angry voters jeered and booed as the architect of the Republican budget plan tried to explain why raising taxes on the rich wouldn't help the United States deal with its deficit problems. John Nichols writes for The Nation magazine as its Washington correspondent. He is also the associate editor of the Capital Times, the daily newspaper in Madison, Wisconsin. Paul Ryan claims the protests heard so very loud and clear during the House Budget Committee chair's town hall meetings in April had no influence on his thinking about Medicare.  Perhaps Ryan really does have a tin ear.  But the outcry over his plan to mess with Medicare, heard in Wisconsin communities from Milton to Kenosha, and at spring recess sessions in the districts of Republican freshmen from Pennsylvania to Florida, obviously influenced other Republicans.  Images from Kenosha \u2014 a historic factory town in Ryan's district, where hundreds of people showed up to criticize his scheming to cut benefits for working Americans while giving billionaires and multinational corporations new tax breaks \u2014 were featured nationally on broadcast network news shows.  Cable news programs focused intense attention on the story. MSNBC's Ed Schultz devoted much of a program last week to the outcry. (In addition to a blistering analysis of the congressman's proposal by the host, this writer provided some on the ground reporting from Kenosha, including details of a brief interview with Ryan, who was typically dismissive of the popular discomfort with his plan.)  But other networks \u2014 even Fox \u2014 at least touched on the congressman's troubles.  The reporting was noticed in Washington where, last week, GOP leaders began almost immediately to distance themselves from Ryan's plan to use Medicare funds to enrich the private insurance firms that have donated so generously to his campaigns.  The disarray among House and Senate Republicans is evident, as they send contradictory signals about how they will treat Medicare and Medicaid in negotiations around Ryan's budget plan. Even as they claim to still be sympathetic to the budget committee chair's plan, GOP leaders are retreating from it.  House Speaker John Boehner now describes the Ryan plan \u2014 which was endorsed by his caucus in a House vote barely a month ago \u2014 as just \"one idea\" among many.  The No. 2 Republican in the House, Eric Cantor, says he's looking for alternatives to Ryan's proposal.  House Ways and Means Chair Dave Camp, (D-MI), says he does not plan to hold hearings regarding Ryan's plan.  The operative term among Republicans now is that the budget committee chair's proposal is a \"starting point\" \u2014 not a destination.  What does this tell us?  The town hall protests across the country shook the GOP.  And the particular protests in Ryan's Wisconsin district had a two-fold impact:  A. They pierced Ryan's image of invincibility. He had long peddled a claim that he could win with these ideas in working-class areas. That was called into question and GOP members from around the country noted it.  B.  They made Medicare an issue in Wisconsin and nationally \u2014 even New York where, in a special election for an open U.S. House seat, Democratic contender Kathy Hochul has surged after attacking Ryan's plan. As the Buffalo News notes, \"The Hochul campaign...has recognized the special dynamics of what looms on May 24 and employs an aide with experience in special elections. The campaign has recognized early on that the educated voters who will vote on Election Day know their issues, that they know the term \"Ryan budget,\" and they know that a major overhaul of Medicare as we know it is part of the deal that Corwin supports. It's why issues matter in a special election. \"I had no idea [at the campaign's start] that the Ryan budget would be in play,\" said [a] Democrat close to the campaign. \"But it's in play.\"  What this all adds up to, whether Ryan wants to admit it or not, is the truth that a grassroots intervention by citizens in Wisconsin and states across the country appears to be changing the course of national policymaking.",

            "article_content": "Florida freshman Rep. Daniel Webster bucked the Tea Party line recently and voted to support the House spending deal pushed by Speaker John Boehner. Days later, the Republican also voted to support a GOP plan to privatize Medicare \u2014 an issue of special interest to Florida seniors.  STEVE INSKEEP, Host: Yesterday, Florida Republican Daniel Webster held a town hall meeting, where the crowd included NPR's Greg Allen. GREG ALLEN: Dan Webster is a freshman Congressman, but no political neophyte. He served 28 years in Florida's legislature before unseating Democrat Alan Grayson in last fall's election. Here in his home district, he has lots of friends. GENE HAWKINS: I'm so proud of what you're doing. I'm so glad we got you in that race. C: Gene Hawkins, husband of Florida's late Senator Paula Hawkins, was one of those attending Webster's town meeting in Orlando. Webster has been in Congress now for just three months, but as a member of a large and influential Republican freshman class, he says he feels he's making a difference. DANIEL WEBSTER: We're showing that we're going to get this jobs and the economy going by just cutting spending. And we believe we can get the budget under control and our debt under control by cutting spending. And that's the focus, and I think it's going to work out good. ALLEN: In an interview, he said it's a tough budget decision, but one that can't be avoided. PAUL RYAN: We cannot keep going. Medicare is going to be broken by the year 2020, which is just nine years away, and - at least Part A - and we've got to do something about it. ALLEN: In front of a standing-room-only audience of some 300 people, Webster puts up charts to talk about the deficit and efforts to bring it under control. WEBSTER: And so there's a problem within the entitlement programs, which are the mandatory spending. The Ryan budget, which you may have heard, quote, is just named after the budget chair, Congressman Ryan, put forth... (SOUNDBITE OF BOOING AND CHEERING) ALLEN: Maria Reynolds asked him how he could support a plan that cuts Medicare, while at the same time lowering taxes for business. MARIA REYNOLDS: And what that does is you're going to give them that tax break to take away Medicare from me. I'm at that age where I wouldn't get it. How do you think - and I have preexisting problems. What insurance company is going to insure me? You tell me. ALLEN: Congressman Webster told her without the overhaul, Medicare may be insolvent and unable to provide her with any coverage when she turns 65. Many in the audience weren't happy with that response, or with the large spending cuts Webster says are unavoidable. Several times he was asked why - along with spending cuts - won't Congress consider raising taxes? WEBSTER: In the economy that we have today, I'm not really in favor of raising taxes, because, to me, we need to get people back to work, and the more we start taxing people, the less opportunity... (SOUNDBITE OF AUDIENCE DISRUPTION) ALLEN: Outside, Sue Costerline was holding a sign protesting Webster's support for the Ryan budget. SUE COSTERLINE: When people realized what they're up to - and a lot of people still don't realize it - when they realize what they're up to, there will be a - the sleeping giant is awakening. ALLEN: Greg Allen, NPR News, Orlando. INSKEEP: Congressman Webster is not the only lawmaker facing questions about Medicare. The man who authored the Republican budget plan is Congressman Paul Ryan of Wisconsin. Ryan received praise from many pundits, but has been getting a more mixed response back home. Many people at his town hall meetings in recent days were supportive, while others booed loudly as Ryan advocated lower taxes for the wealthy.

You get it from voters who are Democrats, Republicans and independents which obviously can make your political life much more difficult than your fellow lawmakers in their safely solid red or blue districts. Some news outlets examine what some of the freshman Republicans in such marginal districts have encountered. Rep. Lou Barletta of Pennsylvania gets attention from both Politico and National Journal. His northeastern Pennsylvania district includes Hazleton, Scranton and Wilkes-Barre and is almost a four-hour drive from Washington. From National Journal: Freshman Rep. Lou Barletta, R-Pa., represents a district that gave Obama 57 percent of the vote in 2008 but has one of the highest percentages of senior citizens in the country. Constituents criticized him for his support of the Ryan plan in a recent town hall meeting. One constituent accused him of trying to \"destroy Medicare.\" Politico gives these details of what may have been the same meeting: In the middle of Barletta's presentation on the national debt, a man in the front row interrupted him. \"As a senior, did I not pay for these Medicare and Social Security benefits? Didn't I give Washington my dollars so that as a senior I could live on them?\" Barletta replied \"Yes, and it is going to be there. It's not being touched for any of the senior citizens now, but for my daughter\u2014\" The man cut him off again. \"It should be there for her as well.\" As Politico also notes, Barletta and other Republican freshmen are also catching flak from Tea Party movement members who believe lawmakers aren't cutting enough spending. For sure, these lawmakers must pay attention to the activists on the right who, after all,  helped them beat incumbent Democrats. But the 2010 election had the generally lower turnout of mid-term elections. There were also concerns about the economy and the controversial new health care law associated with Democrats and President Obama. Voter participation in the 2012 general election is likely to be significantly higher however because President Obama and the Republican nominee will be on the ballot. Thus, the political futures of these freshmen are likely to be determined by many more voters coming out, including those motivated by concerns about real and proposed cuts to federal programs they rely on. So while these lawmakers are caught in the crosscurrents from the right and the left, the concerns of voters, especially seniors and their families worried about Medicare, Social Security and Medicaid, will be there in a way they weren't in 2010. And they give Democrats a surer hook onto which to place their campaigns to win back some of those seats. As Politico further reported: Democrats are hoping that in districts like Barletta's \u2014 which, at more than 115,000, has one of the highest populations of senior citizens in the state \u2014 voters will sour on Republicans once they look at their voting record on Ryan's budget. \"The national Republicans are trying to create this distinction with the president. It's a distinction that these new members can't walk away from. It's one thing to campaign saying that we're going to cut, cut, cut, but it's a whole other thing to cut specific investments that benefit your local community,\" said Josh Shapiro, a state assembly member in southeastern Pennsylvania. Frum Forum's Frosh Update blog reports on some of the Democratic efforts to use the freshmen's votes for Rep. Paul Ryan's recent budget proposal which would privatize Medicare against them.",

Ryan's budget plan. A day after scores of House Republicans abandoned their leadership on a floor vote on the spending bill that avoided a partial government shutdown, they held their ranks Friday in what some saw as an even bigger test of House Speaker Boehner's ability to maintain party discipline. With only four defections, Republicans voted solidly for Rep. Paul Ryan's 2012 budget proposal which would privatize Medicare and turn Medicaid into a block grant program to the states. Representatives Ron Paul (TX), Walter Jones (NC), Dave McKinley (WV) and Denny Rehberg (MT) were the four Republicans voting against. Rehberg is challenging Democrat Sen. Jon Tester for the Senate seat, which may account for his vote. The 235-193 vote was not only a show of GOP unity but also of Democratic discipline since not a single member of the House minority crossed over to vote for the Republican proposal. Not even those of the Blue Dogs who are left. Observers were watching Republicans closely Friday because the day before 59 Republicans had defected during the vote on the spending bill for the remainder of fiscal 2011. Would the massive revisions to some of the nation's most popular entitlement programs dating back to the Great Society of the 1960s cause House Republicans to again walk away in large numbers from their leaders? The question was especially interesting because Democrats were clearly salivating at the prospect of being able to run TV ads with the obligatory ominous music that focused on the Republican proposal to privatize Medicare and shift to the states most of the responsibility for Medicaid. Before the vote, House Minority  Leader Nancy Pelosi attempted to frame the vote as about Medicare, and not the  deficit, and took direct aim at GOP members. \"Do you realize,\" she asked, \"that  your leadership is asking you to cast a vote today to abolish Medicare as we  know it?\" It's an argument that Democrats  believe will have legs as budget and debt limit negotiations continue, but one  that failed to scare off GOP House members - even those in senior-heavy  districts in Florida and Arizona. By their unity, Republicans seemed to be saying to  Democrats \"bring it on.\" In wrapping up floor debate, Ryan characterized the  deficit problem as \"the most predictable economic crisis we've ever had in this  country,\" and repeated what has become an increasingly comment Republican taking  point: that failing to take drastic action to corral the deficit will lead to  the country's irretrievable decline. \"To govern is to choose,\" he  said. The vote was symbolic, which made the Republican solidarity even more impressive. The Ryan budget plan has no chance of passing since it's not going anywhere in the Democratic-controlled Senate and President Obama would veto it if it ever did get out of the Senate. Speaking of Obama, he now can run until the 2012 election against the Republican plan, using it as a way to draw contrasts between himself, the GOP House and the eventual Republican nominee. So the battle lines, which were already fairly well defined were, if nothing else, reinforced Friday.",

Speaker John Boehner is going where practicing Washington politicians normally fear to tread. He's making public his intention to tackle entitlement spending, namely Social Security and Medicare. In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Boehner revealed some of his thinking. Some excerpts: House Speaker John Boehner said Thursday that he's determined to offer a  budget this spring that curbs Social Security and Medicare, despite the  political risks, and that Republicans will try to persuade voters that  sacrifices are needed... ... Mr. Boehner, an Ohio Republican, said he told President Barack Obama  that he would take the political plunge alongside him if the president  announced his own willingness to tackle changes to those programs. \"I offered to the president we could lock arms and walk out and begin  the conversation about the size of the problem,\" Mr. Boehner said,  adding that Mr. Obama responded \"positively.\" Boehner's offer essentially inviting Obama to stand on the third rail of American politics with him, is certainly one you can see Obama refusing. As the president eyes his own re-election, he's probably less concerned with where Boehner stands than on where the eventual Republican presidential nominee is on the issue. Meanwhile, as Boehner said during the interview, many Americans don't know   that entitlements are placing the greatest stress on the nation's  finances, not \"waste, fraud and abuse\" or foreign aid. The WSJ report cited a new poll it conducted with NBC News that showed that most Americans don't want Social Security touched. Indeed, 77 percent said it would be either mostly or totally unacceptable to cut Social Security. And many of those who would draw a line in the sand on Social Security and Medicare would be members of Obama's party, including congressional Democrats. Boehner's offer of political cover would do nothing to help Obama with these voters. Also, consider that a recent Gallup poll showed Obama running essentially even with a generic Republican candidate among voters who were 55 and older. The unnamed Republican was at 45 percent versus Obama at 43 percent. Obama would likely not be helped with this demographic by proposing significant cuts to Social Security and Medicare. In light of all that, and given the political buzzsaw he ran into on the health care law, it would be understandable if the president ultimately told Boehner, \"You go first on reducing entitlement spending. And good luck with that.\"",

A president's budget should always be read first as a political document and no more so than when that president is running for re-election. So President Obama's goal was to practice the political version of the physician's Hippocratic Oath: First do no harm to your chances of winning a second term. So while critics can accuse him of spending too much or cutting too little, Obama is aiming for the golden mean that lets him portray himself as both fiscally responsible and possessing what the first President Bush called the \"vision thing.\" That's what Obama is going for with his calls for Americans to out-educate, out-innovate and out-build its economic competition, to have a Sputnik moment. Some critics are disappointed the president didn't embrace his fiscal responsibility commission's recommendation to rein in Social Security and Medicare. But proposing that money be cut from entitlement programs is definitely not something White House political consultants would typically recommend. So, not surprisingly, that didn't wind up in the president's budget. Again, a budget is meant to help a president contrast himself with the opposition. It's not a suicide pact. Over at The Fiscal Times, Eric Piannin and Merrill Goozner laid out some of the political realities facing the president: Despite pleas from members of his own deficit commission and other deficit hawks on Capitol Hill to address the long term structural deficit, the administration concluded there was no political upside to tackling tax and entitlement reform in his budget, giving Republicans and other administration critics an opportunity to go after him without putting down their own proposals for long-term deficit and debt. Moreover, the administration would pay a huge political price for compromising on Social Security. Liberals and organized labor are already mounting a grass roots campaign to fight changes in eligibility, although they do support increasing the ceiling on wages subject to payroll taxes from the current $106,800 to $180,000, which the administration briefly considered after it was proposed by the fiscal commission. Alice Rivlin, a member of the fiscal commission and a former Clinton administration budget director who had hoped for major proposals on entitlements and tax reform, said that Obama's decision to skirt those issues for now was a smart tactical move. \"The history of the last two years is that everything the president is for, the Republicans immediately attack and say they're against\u2013the clearest example being health care reform,\" she said. \"So if you're working in that atmosphere, I think you have to figure out how am I going to get bipartisan cover.\"",
