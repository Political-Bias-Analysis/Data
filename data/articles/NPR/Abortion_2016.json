Amy Hagstrom Miller of Whole Women's Health had been having a banner year. Her organization, based in Charlottesville, Va., operates several abortion clinics around the country and brought a legal challenge that led the Supreme Court to issue a landmark ruling this past summer. The court struck down abortion restrictions in Texas, setting a precedent that abortion rights groups believe could help turn back a wave of restrictions passed by legislatures across the country in recent years. But now that Donald Trump is the president-elect? \"I'm devastated,\" Miller says. \"I feel stunned. I'm numb.\" Trump's election could have a profound impact on access to abortion. He has said he'll nominate Supreme Court justices who would be likely to overturn Roe v. Wade, the 1973 ruling that legalized the procedure. And he's set to take office with one opening on the court, since Republican senators have refused to consider President Obama's nominee to fill the vacancy created after Justice Antonin Scalia died earlier this year. Miller worries that Trump could have several vacancies to fill, all due to departures from the moderate to liberal wing of the court. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is 83; Anthony Kennedy is 80; and Stephen Breyer is 78. Replacing them could put a conservative stamp on abortion law for decades to come. In a statement, Nancy Northup, president of the advocacy group Center for Reproductive Rights, said, \"Our country now stands perilously close to a return to the dark days when women were forced to put their own lives at risk to get safe and legal abortion care.\" Still, even if the court becomes majority conservative, and even if the right case comes along to challenge Roe v. Wade \u2014 no sure thing \u2014 Julie Rikelman is one who does not think it will be overturned. Rikelman is litigation director with the Center for Reproductive Rights, and says precedent is incredibly important for the Supreme Court. She says the justices addressed this in a major 1992 decision, noting that several generations of women had come of age being able decide whether abortion was right for them. The ruling declared that \"the court's very institutional integrity would be in jeopardy if it reversed course now,\" Rikelman says. In the shorter term, Amy Hagstrom Miller says this year's high court ruling in her case will also continue to have a ripple effect. It says states must consider whether limitations on clinics that provide abortion offer any benefit to women's health. A string of court rulings have already cited the precedent in striking down various restrictions. \"We're poised to win back access for women in a state-by-state level in multiple states because of the strength of the decision we got,\" she says. \"And Trump doesn't get to change that.\" But with the GOP sweep of Congress and the White House, abortion opponents are emboldened. \"The Democrats overreached, and this was a rejection of an extreme agenda,\" says Clarke Forsythe, the acting president of Americans United for Life. Americans United for Life and other abortion opponents have a long wish list, including ending Obamacare's coverage of contraception; banning abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy; and passing a permanent ban on the use of federal funds to pay for abortion, except in cases of rape, incest, or when the life of the mother is at risk. That ban, called the Hyde Amendment, is a four-decade-old compromise between abortion rights groups and opponents, and it generally applies to abortions through Medicaid. Hillary Clinton had campaigned on overturning the ban. Forsythe and others say they'll also work with supporters in Congress to end $500 million in annual federal funding to Planned Parenthood. \"Essential gynecological care for poor women can be addressed by many more community health centers, and state and local government,\" he says. Reproductive health experts dispute that. After Texas ended funding for Planned Parenthood in 2013, research found that lower-income women had trouble accessing contraception, and that led to a substantial rise in births. Forsythe says with the sizeable Democratic bloc in the Senate, none of this will happen overnight. \"The road ahead is not going to be easy,\" he says, \"and I think we have to be realistic about what can be achieved.\" Still, he says the GOP election sweep presents abortion opponents with \"historic opportunities.\" Trump is an unlikely champion for abortion opponents, many of whom base their views on morality and religion. In the past, he's described himself as \"pro-choice in every respect,\" and during the campaign he made conflicting statements on the issue. But he will face pressure from a lobbying force that's newly energized by his election. \"There are a lot of folks who didn't agree with him on many things he said and some of who he is,\" says Victoria Cobb, president of The Family Foundation of Virginia. \"But they were counting on these pro-life promises he has made.\"",

The Supreme Court this week delivered its strongest affirmation of a women's right to abortion in years. By a margin of 5-3, it struck down two key provisions of a Texas law restricting the procedure. But where does the decision in Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt fit in the court's long history of actions on abortion rights and restrictions? And what effect might the case have on similar laws in other states and this fall's elections? Here are five insights about the case that provide some context: 1. It's the first big win for supporters of abortion rights in a long time The last time abortion-rights supporters were on the winning side of a big case at the Supreme Court was 16 years ago, when a 5-4 ruling in Stenberg v. Carhart struck down a Nebraska law banning a specific procedure abortion opponents called \"partial-birth abortion.\" That win was effectively reversed in 2007, however, when the court upheld a similar federal law banning the same procedure, also on a 5-4 ruling, in Gonzales v. Carhart. The substance hadn't changed much, but the replacement of Justice Sandra Day O'Connor with Justice Samuel Alito in 2006 gave abortion opponents an extra vote, which was enough to change the outcome. After Monday's decision, many foes of abortion rights complained that there were few restrictions on abortion that would pass muster with the high court. But, in fact, in the years since the court first legalized abortion nationwide in Roe v. Wade in 1973, about half the major cases have been clear wins for abortion opponents, including upholding state laws requiring parental involvement for minors, waiting periods and bans on the use of public funds to pay for abortions. 2. It could put pro-abortion-rights forces on the offensive Since Republicans took over Congress and most state legislatures after the 2010 elections, states have enacted nearly 300 separate abortion restrictions; the most in any five-year period since Roe was decided. Many of those were the same types of laws claiming protections for women's health that were struck down by the Supreme Court this week. Those laws include requiring doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital and requiring abortion clinics to meet the standards of facilities performing more-involved surgical procedures. The justices have already responded to petitions from some states with similar laws. Just a day after handing down the Texas ruling, they rejected appeals from Mississippi and Wisconsin, where physician admitting privilege laws had been blocked by lower court judges. Those laws are now permanently blocked. Officials in Alabama also dropped their defense of a similar law. But the decision doesn't automatically invalidate similar laws in other states because the effect of such statutes is different in every community. For example, what may amount to an \"undue burden\" in Texas because of the sheer size of the state might not be as burdensome in states with clinics closer together. In states where lower court judges have already blocked laws, those blocks are almost certain to remain in place. But in other states opponents of the restrictions would have to work to overturn each law individually. They say that is what they plan to do. \"We will now will take this fight state by state to challenge and repeal laws all across the country,\" Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards told reporters in a conference call immediately after the ruling. Planned Parenthood announced on Thursday that it would pursue efforts to block or repeal similar laws in eight states: Arizona, Florida, Michigan, Missouri, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia. Abortion-rights supporters are also taking aim at some long-standing abortion restrictions in federal law. The draft Democratic platform that will be finalized at the party's nominating convention in late July includes a plan calling for the repeal of the Hyde Amendment, which has banned most federal abortion funding since 1977. That provision was highlighted and praised by presumptive nominee Hillary Clinton's campaign, noting that it represents the first time such an explicit vow has been included. 3. Opponents of abortion rights aren't likely to retreat While the latest Supreme Court ruling was definitely a setback for abortion foes, they are not giving up. For one thing, opponents remain in control of a majority of state legislatures and governorships, and that's unlikely to change following this year's national elections. \"Americans United for Life will continue to fight \u2014 in legislatures and in the courts \u2014 to protect women from a dangerous and greedy abortion industry,\" said AUL Acting President and Senior Counsel Clarke Forsythe. Americans United for Life has been at the forefront of developing model laws restricting access to abortion. The movement against abortion rights has a much larger menu to choose from than the two issues the high court addressed. For example, many states (including Texas) have passed or are considering bans on abortion after roughly 20 weeks of pregnancy. Many of those bans are being challenged in the courts but none has yet reached the Supreme Court. Other restrictions include requiring pregnant women to have ultrasounds before an abortion, to make multiple visits to an abortion provider and banning the use of telemedicine for medical (as opposed to surgical) abortions using the abortion pill mifepristone. Abortion opponents say they aren't giving up on pursuing health and safety standards like the ones struck down in Texas, either. \"This issue of safety standards is not over,\" said Marilyn Musgrave, vice president of government affairs at Susan B. Anthony List. Even some similar laws could pass muster if they are crafted carefully enough, said Kristi Hamrick, a spokeswoman for Americans United for Life. \"We don't have a one-size-fits-all bill to send to the 50 states,\" she said. \"The law is specific and so the tools must be too.\" 4. The decision could shake up national politics Both sides in the long-polarized abortion debate are already pointing to the case in an effort to mobilize their supporters. \"This certainly makes the November presidential election even more critical,\" said Musgrave of the Susan B. Anthony List. \"It is so obvious that we need to elect a pro-life president.\" On the opposite side, Ilyse Hogue, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, says the decision \"underscores what the election means for Supreme Court jurisprudence.\" With one vacancy already on the court and others likely in the next four years, she said, \"reproductive freedom is very much on the ballot this November.\" The Clinton campaign hailed the decision. \"We need a president who will defend women's health and rights and appoint Supreme Court justices who recognize Roe v. Wade as settled law,\" said a statement from the candidate. And while presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump's campaign was silent on the issue in the immediate aftermath of the decision, Musgrave said abortion opponents are confident he is on their side. \"Say what you will about Donald Trump, his commitment to nominate pro-life justices \u2014 I've never seen another candidate do that,\" she said. 5. Younger generation will have a lot to say about the future of abortion rights Among the many things the two sides in the abortion debate disagree about is how the younger generation feels about abortion. Polls tend to differ dramatically depending on how the question is asked. Musgrave says, \"Our polling shows more and more millennials are pro-life, particularly when you look at things like 20-week [abortion] bans.\" But Dawn Laguens, executive vice president of Planned Parenthood, says they are seeing the exact opposite \u2014 that younger women are more supportive of abortion rights. \"They're so social-justice oriented,\" she said. And Laguens says that coming demographic changes, including a more diverse electorate that could tilt Democratic, are a main reason for the recent spike in anti-abortion legislating. \"They feel it slipping away,\" she said. \"They can see the demographics, too, and they want to lock this stuff in.\" Kaiser Health News is an editorially independent news service that is part of the nonpartisan Henry J.

Republican President-elect Donald Trump now stands to reshape the court in his image, potentially for a generation. On Jan. 20, 2016, exactly a year before a new president would be sworn into office, Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia announced the court's 8-to-1 decision reinstating the death penalty for two Kansas brothers. It was the last time the 79-year-old Scalia would announce an opinion. Three weeks later, on a hunting trip in Texas, the conservative icon died in his sleep. Since then, the year has been one long roller-coaster ride for the Supreme Court, with the eight remaining justices putting off the most controversial cases while President Obama and the U.S. Senate struggled over filling the vacancy. Former Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, pictured in 2011. His death Feb. 13 set in motion an unprecedented delay for confirmation hearings for President Obama's pick to replace him.\n                \n                    \n                    Charles Rex Arbogast/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Former Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, pictured in 2011. His death Feb. 13 set in motion an unprecedented delay for confirmation hearings for President Obama's pick to replace him. Republicans were shocked and horrified at Scalia's death. Not only was he a revered figure in the conservative community, but he was the fifth conservative vote on a court that was often split along liberal-conservative lines. What's more, though, it was an election year. There was plenty of time to confirm a replacement, and no precedent for stalling for nearly a year to stave off that possibility. If Obama could fill the slot, it would mean that for the first time in a half-century, a majority of the justices would be Democratic appointees. Within hours of Scalia's death, however, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell vowed to block consideration of anyone Obama would nominate to the court. The choice, McConnell said, should be made by the next president, after the election, to \"give the people a voice in filling this vacancy.\" Obama tried to finesse an appointment, picking as his nominee a relative centrist, a man Republicans had urged him to appoint when there were earlier vacancies: Merrick Garland, the chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, and a man beloved and respected by his colleagues on both the right and the left. Senate leader Mitch McConnell speaks to the media Feb. 23, 10 days after Justice Scalia's death. He said GOP leadership would deny confirmation hearings for any Obama nominee to fill the vacancy.\n                \n                    \n                    Mark Wilson/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Senate leader Mitch McConnell speaks to the media Feb. 23, 10 days after Justice Scalia's death. He said GOP leadership would deny confirmation hearings for any Obama nominee to fill the vacancy. Obama kept pointing out that he had fulfilled his constitutional duty. \"Now it's time for the Senate to do their job,\" he declared. \"Give Judge Garland a hearing. Give Judge Garland an up-or-down vote.\" But McConnell didn't budge. His position was so unprecedented that many Republicans, in addition to Democrats, thought the GOP would pay a price at the polls for such obstructionism. The ploy, however, turned out to be ingenious. Twisting arms and making quiet threats, McConnell managed to keep his own Senate troops in line. Meanwhile, candidate Donald Trump was catering to the socially conservative base of the Republican Party by promising to name a Scalia-like conservative to the court. And while Hillary Clinton rarely mentioned the court on the campaign trail, Trump drove the issue home relentlessly day after day. \"You have no choice,\" he told conservatives. \"You got to go for Trump.\" To allay their fears further, Trump released a list of 21 potential Supreme Court nominees, largely compiled by the conservative Heritage Foundation. Moreover, in the aftermath of the election, Trump said what he had not before \u2014 he would fill the Scalia vacancy with someone from that list. Among the 21, the odds-on favorite is federal appeals court Judge William Pryor of Alabama, mainly because Trump's attorney general designate, Jeff Sessions, is also from Alabama and has considerable influence with the president-elect. Judge Pryor is an outspoken critic of Supreme Court decisions on abortion, gay rights and the so-called Miranda warning. But when he was Alabama's attorney general, he won points among many for his role in removing the state's chief justice for refusing to obey a federal court order to take a Ten Commandments monument out of the courthouse. Also believed to be at the top of the short list is Judge Diane Sykes, a federal appeals court judge from Wisconsin, with a bedrock conservative record. She authored an opinion expanding the rights of employers to limit their workers' access to contraceptives on religious grounds. She wrote an opinion striking down Chicago's law banning firing ranges within city limits. And she wrote an opinion mandating state subsidies for anti-gay religious groups on college campuses, a position the Supreme Court subsequently reversed. Also believed to be on the Trump short list are other serious conservative judges from the federal appeals courts. Among them: Raymond Kethledge of Michigan, who ordered the IRS to turn over a list of conservative groups it had targeted for examination; Judge Thomas Hardiman of Pennsylvania, who dissented when his court upheld a New Jersey law that required citizens to show a \"demonstrated\" need for carrying a gun in public; Judge Raymond Gruender of Missouri, who wrote a decision upholding state-mandated suicide warnings before abortions; and Judge Steven Colloton, who is known for a number of decisions reversing major verdicts that favored whistleblowers and consumers. Judge Colloton has a particular plus; he is from Iowa, the home state of the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Republican Charles Grassley. Many of these potential nominees are said to have sympathetic personal stories. Judge Sykes, for instance, raised two children as a single mother after her divorce. Judge Gruender, the son of a janitor, had a childhood touched by family violence. In 1986, when he was a law student, his father pointed a gun at him, his sister and a younger brother. Gruender and his sister were shot, but Gruender was able to knock his father to the floor, saving his 12-year-old brother, according to local news reports. There are other names on the Trump list, and as we have seen with other high-profile slots, Trump is more than willing to change his mind. But with Trump and his team now pushing to name and confirm his Cabinet, settling on a Supreme Court nominee is not immediately on the front burner. It likely will happen after the new president is sworn in. An announcement is expected in January or early February, with confirmation hearings sometime in March and, unless there are unforeseen difficulties, a vote by the full Senate sometime in April. Even if the Senate is able to meet that schedule, however, the Supreme Court term will almost be over, with just six days of oral arguments left on the schedule in late April. Just what approach the Democrats will take would seem to depend on who is nominated for the vacant Scalia seat, and what is learned about the nominee and his or her record. The Democrats could filibuster, but anything more than a token talkathon is likely to provoke Republicans into changing the rules and abolishing the filibuster as it applies to Supreme Court confirmations. Some Republicans would prefer not to do that, but if it proves necessary, GOP leader McConnell will likely make the move, just as Democrats would have done if they had won the presidency and the Senate.",

Republicans claimed another electoral victory in the final Senate race of 2016 on Saturday, with Republican John Kennedy defeating Democrat Foster Campbell in a runoff election in Louisiana. The win by Kennedy, the state treasurer, will give Republicans a 52-48 majority in the Senate come January. He succeeds retiring GOP Sen. David Vitter, who lost a bid for governor last year and decided not to seek re-election. Campbell, a commissioner on the state's Public Service Commission board, and Kennedy had advanced to the runoff following the state's non-partisan primary on Nov. 8. Since no candidate got a majority of the votes, the top-two finishers faced off on Saturday. The Democratic nominee had tried to use his party's disappointing results last month as a way to inject momentum into his long-shot campaign. Some celebrities, including Rosie O'Donnell, Patton Oswalt and John Leguizamo, made fundraising pleas for Campbell, and that did have an effect. In the final reporting period, he raised $2.5 million. Kennedy, in comparison, raised $1.6 million. On paper, there were some potential makings of an upset. Campbell emphasized some of his conservative positions, like his opposition to abortion rights. He struck populist tones in his campaign too by railing against corporate interests, much like Donald Trump. And Kennedy is also a former Democrat who once supported abortion rights. In 2004, he unsuccessfully ran for Senate as a Democrat, then later switched to the GOP but also launched an unsuccessful Senate bid in 2008. Ultimately, in a state that Trump won by 20 points, there were just huge hurdles Campbell couldn't overcome. The national party seemed to realize the same thing and never came to his aid. Republicans made sure not to take the race for granted, though. President-elect Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence each campaigned for Kennedy in the final stretch. \"He's a good guy, No. 1, he's a good person,\" Trump told voters at a rally Friday in Baton Rouge, according to ABC News. \"And if he doesn't win, I have got myself a problem in Washington because, you know, we have \u2014 it's pretty close. It's pretty close. We need John in Washington not only for the vote. We need him for leadership and everything else, but if you go there, we're going to win.\"",

            "article_content": "Election 2016 isn't quite over yet. Louisiana voters will soon pick a new senator, and Republicans are trying hard to make sure they hold onto the seat.  AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: There's a runoff election this weekend between candidates for one of Louisiana's U.S. Senate seats. And since they're competing for the last undecided seat in the chamber, they're drawing national attention. As Ryan Kailath of member station WWNO explains, Democrats around the country are pinning their hopes on a miracle in Louisiana. RYAN KAILATH, BYLINE: Imagine a Super Bowl where every team in the entire NFL plays all at once. That's how statewide elections work in Louisiana. Instead of traditional primaries that narrow the field down to a few party favorites, in Louisiana, every candidate competes at once. So on Election Day, there were 24 choices for Senator, and none of them won a majority. Now, the top two contenders go into overtime. JOHN NEELY KENNEDY: Just forget about polls. Forget about the experts. We got to get folks out to vote. KAILATH: That's the frontrunner, Republican John Neely Kennedy. He switched parties nine years ago, a fact that his opponent, Democrat Foster Campbell, loves to bring up. FOSTER CAMPBELL: John Kennedy is a complete phony. He's been pro-choice. Now he's pro-life. I don't know what he is today. KAILATH: Now, an election in a fairly conservative state like this doesn't usually draw attention. But after Donald Trump won the White House, demoralized Democrats have turned to Foster Campbell. He's done the cable news shows, gotten the celebrity endorsements. Organizers hold nightly phone banks in New York and Los Angeles. And Campbell says the money is pouring in. CAMPBELL: When we got through with the campaign, I had $8,000 left and I owed $80,000. KAILATH: In this final stretch, he's raised more than $2.5 million. CAMPBELL: We're tickled to death, and we're running like we're 100 points behind. But we're not. KAILATH: But every poll here says they are double digits behind. Even still, Republicans aren't taking any chances. Vice President-elect Mike Pence came to Louisiana on Saturday to stump for his guy, and the GOP has opened 10 offices around the state. Senator Roger Wicker. ROGER WICKER: I've seen some surprises happen. And we don't intend to be surprised this time. KAILATH: If he wins, Kennedy would give Republicans 52 seats instead of 51. Wicker says that extra Senate seat can be crucial. WICKER: You don't always count on getting every vote for every issue, so it's nice to have that cushion. KAILATH: And fears of an upset notwithstanding, the cushion seems comfortable. JIM NICKEL: Well, this is Kennedy's race to lose. I mean, Donald Trump got the most votes in the history of Louisiana less than a month ago. KAILATH: Jim Nickel is a veteran Democratic operative in Louisiana. He says an upset would require two things - high African-American turnout for Campbell and low white turnout for Kennedy. The first one doesn't look so good. Black turnout was low during early voting. As for the white vote, Nickel compares Donald Trump to a prize deer. After those white voters landed Trump, he says, they might think their job is done. NICKEL: Some people have gotten their trophy deer and they're sitting back on the Lazy-Boy and watching football, and some want to go get one more doe. I think there's enough of them that want one more deer. They're going to go vote for John Kennedy. KAILATH: Nickel says there's probably no one issue or event strong enough to turn out the voters Campbell needs. And it looks like the Democratic Party may have given up this fight as well. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee didn't answer repeated calls. A banner on the group's website reads simply (reading) stay tuned to learn more about our efforts to take back the Senate.

            "article_content": "Whatever a Trump administration does when it comes to abortion, state by state legal battles over the procedure will continue to play out. More lawsuits and another restrictions were announced this week.  AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: There's plenty of speculation about how the incoming Trump administration might restrict abortion. The president-elect has said he'd like to see the Supreme Court overturn Roe v. Wade and leave it to each state to decide whether to keep abortion legal. Trump has also nominated a staunch abortion opponent to lead the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Now, the fact is it's already pretty hard to get an abortion in some states, and the legal battle is ongoing. Developments this week made that clear. Joining us to talk more is NPR's Jennifer Ludden. And I understand you want to start with Texas. That's because officials there announced a state regulation that will require aborted fetuses to either be buried or cremated. What's behind this? JENNIFER LUDDEN, BYLINE: Well, supporters say this is about dignity, as they put it. This would show the same respect for unborn infants as for other human beings. They say that aborted fetuses should not be just treated as medical waste as happens now. Under the new rule, now it would be up to medical providers to pay for this burial or cremation. Abortion rights groups say that, you know, this is a cost that's going to be passed down to women that would create another kind of barrier to the procedure. And they also say that mandating, you know, cremation or burial of a fetus is a psychological burden. It really aims to shame women. And they plan to challenge the Texas rule before it's slated to take effect December 19. CORNISH: Now, how common is a statute like this? LUDDEN: Well, Vice President-elect Mike Pence signed a similar law in Indiana earlier this year. Louisiana also passed one. Both those laws had been put on hold by courts before they took effect. I spoke with Americans United for Life, which promotes model legislation like this, and they say they are talking to lawmakers in other states, and we can expect to see more laws like this. CORNISH: Meantime, abortion rights groups have actually filed new lawsuits I understand in three different states. What are they challenging? LUDDEN: Right, so there's Planned Parenthood, the ACLU and the Center for Reproductive Rights. They filed three lawsuits against three different laws in three different states. In North Carolina, there is a law that bans abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy. It has an exception only in the case of medical emergencies. In Missouri, there are restrictions on doctors and clinics, and abortion rights groups say they have closed all but one clinic that performs abortion in that state. And then in Alaska, there is a restriction that abortion rights groups say has forced women to fly to other states to have second-trimester abortions. CORNISH: Now, abortion policy didn't play that big a role in the election this year. I mean why do you think that these legal challenges are happening now? LUDDEN: So this is really part of a process that, you know, has been going on for a number of years. We have had in recent years hundreds of abortion restrictions passed across the country driven by Republican-dominated legislatures. They have been working their way up. And earlier this year, we saw a landmark Supreme Court decision. The Supreme Court overturned laws in Texas, and in doing so it said that abortion restrictions should benefit women's health. And despite supporters' claims, these laws in Texas did not do that. Now, abortion rights groups have said this is a case that they can apply to a lot of other restrictions. This is a precedent that will help them overturn other laws. And this week they said they're going on the offensive with these three new lawsuits, and there's going to be more to come. CORNISH: So isn't there a new risk for abortion rights groups in pursuing these legal challenges - right? If these lawsuits work their way up to the Supreme Court, there could be one or more justices appointed by President Trump by then. LUDDEN: Right, and abortion rights groups do concede, yes, there is a new risk now. But they also say, you know, there is long-term precedent. That's a big factor in Supreme Court decisions. And they point out that many justices from different administrations have all upheld a constitutional right to abortion over many decades, so they're hopeful that that could still be the case on a Trump Supreme Court. CORNISH: That's NPR's Jennifer Ludden. Jennifer, thank you. LUDDEN: Thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

President-elect Donald Trump has made it clear that Vice President-elect Mike Pence will have a major role in governing. He recently tapped Pence to take over leadership of his transition planning from New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, and Pence spent the day Tuesday at Trump Tower as the two men select key members of their administration. It's hard to imagine two men with more different personalities and backgrounds. Trump \u2014 with his brand name and background in real estate \u2014 was an unconventional candidate from the beginning. Pence, meanwhile, is a far more recognizable Republican, who is known for introducing himself as \"a basic guy\" and \"a Christian, a conservative and a Republican, in that order.\" Pence's reputation as a staunch social conservative who's opposed to abortion rights and same-sex marriage helped reassure nervous members of the party base. From that first day, Trump promised that Pence \u2014 the sitting governor of Indiana with a decade of experience in Congress before that \u2014 would help him govern. At a news conference in July in New York City, Trump introduced Pence as his running mate and promised the Indiana governor would be his \"partner\" in both the campaign and the White House. Vice presidents are often relegated to the background, and Pence's low-key personality might suggest he would experience the same. He made few headlines during the campaign \u2014 perhaps the biggest when his plane skidded off a runway upon landing at New York's LaGuardia Airport. The two men have differed at times not just on tone, but on policy. Even so, Pence has unflinchingly defended and promoted Trump throughout the campaign. On election night, it was Pence who introduced Trump to the world as the new president-elect of the United States. \"The American people have spoken and the American people have elected their new champion,\" Pence told the exuberant crowd gathered at a Hilton hotel in Midtown Manhattan. As Pence noted with this self-deprecating joke at the Republican National Convention, he and Trump couldn't be more different in their styles: \"You know, he's a man known for a large personality, a colorful style and lots of charisma,\" Pence joked. \"And so, I guess he was just looking for some balance on the ticket.\" But Trump seems to be positioning Pence to do some heavy lifting while the incoming president crafts the vision. In an interview soon after the election, Trump told the Wall Street Journal that Pence will play a \"big role,\" handling policy areas including health care and serving as a \"liaison\" to Congress. Trump noted Pence's friendship with House Speaker Paul Ryan, a leader Trump has had a sometimes-tense relationship with. Ryan introduced Pence at the Republican convention as a \"good friend.\" \"I've watched this man up close. I've seen what he's made of. Let me tell you something about Mike Pence. This is a man of solid character,\" Ryan said. Back home in Indiana, Pence is also popular with leading Republicans, like state Sen. Brandt Hershman, who describes him as genuine and well-liked. \"Mike is a known quantity on the Hill, and has a great deal of experience \u2014 but I think it speaks more to him as a person,\" Hershman said. As the majority floor leader in the Indiana State Senate, Hershman watched Pence navigate the controversy over so-called religious freedom legislation. Pence supported the proposal, which was criticized as discriminatory by LGBT advocates. He later caught flak from conservative religious groups for supporting an amendment aimed at toning down some aspects of the bill. Hershman said Pence earned a reputation as a good listener: \"I saw the people going in and out of his office sharing their views, and obviously those views were oftentimes very divergent, and I don't think anybody walked out of the office angry with Mike Pence.\" In the wake of a divisive election, calming tempers on all sides may be a big task for President-elect Trump's right-hand man.",

            "article_content": "Statements from President-elect Donald Trump raise questions about the incoming administration, big issues before the Supreme Court and progress toward nominating a ninth Supreme Court justice.  ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: And now some questions about the incoming Trump administration - some potentially big issues before the Supreme Court and Trump's progress toward nominating a ninth Supreme Court justice. For this, I'm joined by NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg. Hi, Nina. NINA TOTENBERG, BYLINE: Hi, Robert. SIEGEL: And first, I'd like you to sort out for us two apparently conflicting statements that Donald Trump made on \"60 Minutes.\" One was about the Supreme Court and abortion. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DONALD TRUMP: I'm pro-life. The judges will be pro-life. SIEGEL: And as for overturning Roe v. Wade... (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: If it ever were overturned, it would go back to the states. SIEGEL: Meaning states could criminalize or legalize abortion. Another legal issue he was asked about - does he support same-sex marriage? (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: It's irrelevant because it was already settled. It's law. It was settled in the Supreme Court. I mean, it's done. SIEGEL: So, Nina, in one case, he says a Supreme Court decision ought to be overturned. In the other case, the court's decision ends the discussion. Is there anything different about those two issues in Supreme Court rulings? TOTENBERG: No. They're both constitutional decisions. SIEGEL: Marriage equality was taken up a lot more recently than abortion. Is there any typical bias in favor of recent rulings, as opposed to old ones? TOTENBERG: Actually, the opposite - the longer a decision is in place, the more weight it has. And in the case of abortion, that decision has been repeatedly reaffirmed over a period of 43 years - versus the same-sex marriage decision, which is just 17 months old. And, indeed, while the court has fleshed out how far states can go in regulating abortions, it's not fleshed out how far states go in discriminating against same-sex couples on religious grounds. SIEGEL: Now, if President Obama's nominee Merrick Garland had been confirmed, that would've made an immediate difference in the ideological makeup of the court. But that's not going to be so with this nomination, now that Trump is going to be president, whoever it ends up being, right? TOTENBERG: Right. We get a conservative for a seat previously held by a conservative, as opposed to the centrist liberal Garland likely would have been. This, in some ways, is the dress rehearsal for the next nomination, which, if it happens, will make all the difference in the world. Two of the justices, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Justice Anthony Kennedy, are over 80. Justice Breyer is 78. Ginsburg and Breyer are among the court's liberals. The third, Justice Kennedy, is a generally conservative justice. But he's the author of the court's same-sex marriage decision. And he's been the deciding vote in upholding the right to abortion. So if any of those three goes, you will see dramatically more conservative rulings on these and other issues for a generation to come, at least. SIEGEL: So how soon do you think it'll be before the incoming president announces his nominee to fill the current vacancy? TOTENBERG: I don't expect the nomination until we have an official President Trump, until he's sworn in. He has a government that can vet candidates. He can officially give them to the FBI to do a thorough background check. SIEGEL: And what do you know about what Donald Trump really wants in the way of a Supreme Court justice? TOTENBERG: Well, people around Trump acknowledged that he's no Supreme Court expert. But he knows what he doesn't want. And he doesn't want surprises. And by that, he means somebody like Justice David Souter, who was appointed by the first President George Bush, and Chief Justice John Roberts, who is anathema to many conservatives because he voted to uphold the ACA. SIEGEL: Now, during the campaign, Trump actually released lists of people who would be the kind of people he would nominate to the Supreme Court - 21 names I believe. What - who are they? TOTENBERG: Both these lists were compiled largely by the conservative Heritage Foundation. And the names range from very conservative to very, very conservative. None is a household name. Indeed, some of the most well-known conservative judges and lawyers in the country aren't on the list. But I'm told this nominee will come from the lists. And I would expect that the older ones and the younger ones will get knocked off. And the person will have a track record that attracted Trump and, therefore, will unattract a lot of Democrats and their constituencies. SIEGEL: NPR's Nina Totenberg, thank you. TOTENBERG: Thank you.

            "article_content": "Women across the country are rushing to get IUDs. Or at least, they're tweeting about rushing to get long-term birth control, according to a surge of messages on social media. They're concerned that the Trump administration might end Obamacare provisions that require insurers to cover intrauterine devices and other contraception and cut funding for abortion and reproductive health overall. So women are looking for long-term solutions like IUDs: ones that will outlast a presidency. But they may have a bit more time than they think. Just scheduled that IUD insertion so that I'm not forced to be pregnant and lay down every plan I've ever made for my life \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffc#IUD They're not just talking about it on social media; they're looking for more information, too. Google Trends showed a massive peak in searches for \"IUD\" \"birth control\" and \"Planned Parenthood\" on Wednesday. The online conversations have left a lot of women wondering how much longer their birth control will be available without copays, as is required under the Affordable Care Act. The short answer is that while memes say women should get their IUDs before Inauguration Day, things might not be quite so urgent. The wheels of government take time to turn, so nobody will lose coverage on Day 1 of the Trump administration. But women are already acting. \"I booked an appointment with my gynecologist the instant North Carolina went red,\" Kate McPhillips, a young professional in Boston, posted to her Facebook page Wednesday morning. She is considering the switch to a copper IUD, the type that lasts for 10 to 12 years, \"just in case the unimaginable happens.\" Dr. Anne Davis, consulting medical director for Physicians for Reproductive Health and an associate professor of clinical obstetrics and gynecology at Columbia University Medical Center in New York City, says that on Wednesday six women called \"in a panic\" to schedule IUD appointments. Normally, only about one woman calls to book an IUD insertion each day. \"And these women weren't just looking for an appointment somewhere in the future. They wanted one right now. They were very, very scared and distraught that they would lose access to birth control,\" Davis says. Others who work in women's' health and reproduction are very concerned about the long-term changes a Trump presidency might bring. \"It's an understatement to say that we're nervous,\" says Dr. Eve Espey, chair of the department of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center. There are multiple ways Trump's administration and Congress could make access to birth control more difficult, beyond repealing the Affordable Care Act, which Trump has vowed to do. They include: Although Trump could put these changes into motion on his first day in office, insurance plans already purchased for 2017 would probably still be honored. Secretary of Health and Human Services Sylvia Burwell tweeted that signups at HealthCare.gov for 2017 have spiked since the election. There's been a rush on reproductive health centers, too. We called over a dozen regional Planned Parenthood divisions across the country. They all report more women than usual calling to book appointments, and more women asking questions about IUDs. Even though women won't lose access to copay-free birth control immediately, Davis says women should take action soon. \"This isn't something to put off, and if you're on corporate insurance sometimes it takes a while for IUDs to be ordered. If you need a long-acting form of birth control, you need to take care of that now.\" On the other hand, there's Espey. She agrees that choosing long-lasting contraceptives may become a priority for more women, but she is also concerned that women might be making these moves a little too quickly. \"When people are under stress, they're more likely to make decisions that they regret later.\" Women shouldn't rush to make decisions about birth control, she says. They should speak with their doctors and learn the side effects. But she notes that long-lasting reversible birth control like IUDs and hormonal implants, while not 100 percent effective, are pretty much foolproof ways to prevent pregnancy. Planned Parenthood of Metropolitan Washington D.C., has seen an increase in women looking for birth control since Tuesday. The uncertainty \"makes women nervous,\" says Laura Meyers, the president and CEO. We asked representatives for Trump on Wednesday if birth control will stay copay-free during his presidency, but did not hear back. This could be because Trump's team has since rolled out a new website and media hotline, where we have followed up. We will update this page if they reply.",

            "article_content": "NPR takes a look at how President-elect Donald Trump might govern, and what his priorities might be in the first days of his administration.  AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: If the big question this morning was just how Donald Trump pulled off one of the biggest political upsets of all time, there's another one this afternoon. Just what exactly will President-elect Trump do once he's in the White House? NPR's Scott Detrow covered the Trump campaign. He joins us now. And, Scott, what do we know about what sort of policies will Trump push for once he's president? SCOTT DETROW, BYLINE: You know, one constant in Donald Trump's life and career is that he's shifted his stance on a lot, so we can't really say for sure right now. You know, just one example - abortion rights. He supported them for a long time, but then he said he opposed them when he ran for president. So in the final weeks of this campaign, Trump did talk a lot about his plan for his first hundred days in office. There were a lot of policies in there - a long laundry list - everything from tax cuts to beginning to renegotiate trade deals to finding and deporting people in the country illegally with criminal records. One big thing that we'll see early that Trump said he's going to do right away and congressional leaders seem onboard with - repealing the Affordable Care Act. CORNISH: We know that both campaigns had been working on transition plans for months. What do we know about Trump's process? DETROW: Well, Trump put New Jersey Governor Chris Christie in charge of his transition team. And Christie has remained in that position, despite the conviction of some of his top aides recently for that scheme to clog up traffic on the George Washington Bridge. In fact, Christie could be nominated for a top cabinet spot. Other names being floated include former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich. Another name that has been helping with the transition is former Utah Governor Mike Leavitt. But still, the thing is that not many high-profile Republicans flocked to Trump this year, aside from that group, so there's a real mystery here about how he fills the rest of so many top-level appointments in and out of the executive branch. CORNISH: Any sense of how Trump will work with the Obama administration on this transition? DETROW: You know, I think it's going to be really tough. President Obama was out there campaigning against Trump, not just saying he disagreed with them - saying that, fundamentally, Donald Trump was not qualified to be president. He shouldn't have the nuclear codes. Soon Trump is going to begin getting briefed on those nuclear codes. He'll be getting full classified intelligence briefings. But President Obama did come out today to the Rose Garden and said he pledged to work with the president-elect. And we've seen several cabinet secretaries, including Secretary of State John Kerry, issue similar statements saying they will, too. You know, President Obama and President George W. Bush were very proud of the way that they transitioned power. And those were two people who do not really see eye to eye on many issues, at all. CORNISH: Finally, Scott, we heard earlier about how President-elect Trump would need Congress to accomplish some of his goals, like repealing Obamacare. But what does he have the power to do from the executive branch? DETROW: A lot - President Obama did a lot with executive actions. And the benefit of those for a president is you don't need to get them through Congress. The negative - the next president can just get rid of them. A lot of these things take a lot of time to go into place, and it would take a long time to unwind them. But President Trump can instantly start the process by signing paperwork getting that moving. One big thing that Trump says he's going to try to repeal as quickly as he can - it's the centerpiece of the American contribution to last year's major climate change agreement. That's something that would have cut power plant emissions by about 30 percent over the coming decades. It really would have reduced the country's carbon footprint. But Donald Trump has questioned climate change, and he says that's something he wants to scrap right away. CORNISH: That's NPR's Scott Detrow, covering the Trump campaign. Scott, thanks.

When Donald Trump came down the escalator in June of 2015 in the tower he named for himself in Manhattan, few of us who do politics for a living took his off-the-cuff announcement for president seriously. But the past 17 months have been a lesson to all of us who flattered ourselves \u2014 as campaign pros, polling pros and media pros \u2014 that we knew more about politics than he did. What have we learned? That Trump was being taken very seriously, indeed, by the people who ultimately mattered: voters. Not all the voters, surely. It is not yet clear that he even won the popular vote, as counting continues in some states and Hillary Clinton might still win that metric. Much of the country woke up the day after in disbelief at the news of his election, even as financial markets were reeling from a night of selloffs around the world. Yet Trump racked up a clear majority in the Electoral College. And he did it by winning the Anglo white vote (58 percent of it, according to the exit polls). Among people of color, he got just 21 percent. He won among men (53 percent), people older than 44 (53 percent) and people without a college degree (52 percent). Among white people without a college degree, his share was a stunning 67 percent. The Democratic Party, which rose as the party of labor when that meant the party of the white working class, could not even compete for that vote in the critical states of Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. Trump won the last three by about 1 percentage point each \u2014 and with those slim margins, he claimed the presidency. Trump narrowly lost those voters who have a college degree. But he managed to win among white college graduates by 4 percentage points, avoiding a loss with this group that would have been the first for a Republican nominee since data of this kind have been collected. It must also be said that Trump has been elected with the worst favorable-unfavorable ratio of any major party nominee in the history of polling \u2014 consistently above 60 percent unfavorable. He kept that number up by insulting immigrants and women and NATO and Gold Star veterans' families. He did it making friendly noises toward Russian President Vladimir Putin. But those who do like Trump, or who dislike all his rivals more, were enough to make him a winner. It started in the primaries. In a field of 17, Trump stood out by connecting with people who previously thought of him as a TV celebrity, a real estate mogul or a casino magnate.

Trump racked up a clear majority in the Electoral College. They knew he had no background as a politician. And they liked that about him. They knew he had little respect for the past four or five Republican candidates for president, including those who had won. And they liked that about him. He was critical of the Iraq War begun by GOP President George W. Bush, and the trade deals negotiated by presidents of both parties over several decades. And they liked that about him. Trump said outrageous things, insulting former prisoner of war John McCain and Fox News host Megyn Kelly, among others. He refused to commit to supporting the Republican nominee unless his own candidacy was \"treated fairly.\" None of this seemed to bother Trump supporters nearly as much as we, the pros, said it had to. And when a Muslim couple with ties to ISIS killed 14 people and wounded 22 more in San Bernardino on Dec. 2, 2015, many campaign pros thought Trump would fade as a candidate. After all, he had no military service and no previous office. Wrong again. Trump's candidacy took off again after he called for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the U.S. Trump stitched together an unlikely coalition of voters to outpace 16 intraparty rivals. He did it with outreach to those not yet recovered from the 2008-09 recession, or from the loss of high-wage factory jobs. He did it by winning over evangelical Christians, abortion opponents, gun owners and ordinary people incensed at Washington and Wall Street and fearful about terrorism and immigration.

The convention was rocky when Sen. Ted Cruz was refusing to endorse him and Ohio Gov. John Kasich was boycotting the proceedings. And once he had become the nominee of the Republican Party, Trump needed only to hold his base constituency and add the reluctant votes of other Republicans and compatible independents. He didn't need all those GOP officeholders who kept their distance or the big donors who looked away or the conservative opinion-makers who denounced him. His convention in Cleveland was rocky, with high-profile rival Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas refusing to endorse him and home-state Gov. John Kasich boycotting the proceedings. In the fall, after a series of controversies about Muslims, immigrants and allegations of sexual assault, Trump stumbled through three debates with Hillary Clinton that most people thought she won. Late in October, the Trump campaign seemed rudderless and sinking. Clinton's lead in some polls ran out to double digits. Then came a ray of hope. FBI Director James Comey announced the discovery of a new stash of emails that might be relevant to the earlier, months-long investigation of Clinton's personal email server. Suddenly, the Democratic nominee was back at the bottom of the rain barrel. The polls moved Trump's way. Financial markets moved lower, anxious about Trump's trade antagonism \u2014 among other issues. But in the final days before Election Day, Comey sounded an all-clear. Never mind, he said, the emails were duplicates or personal matters. The polls turned around again, the markets rose dramatically on Monday and trended higher until the close on Election Day. So on election eve, the consensus of high-quality independent polling was that Clinton was leading nationally by 4 points. Most of us pros were expecting the suspense to be about her margin of victory. Would it be big enough to bring home a Democratic majority in the Senate? Would it be enough to give her a mandate? Even some of Trump's surrogates and staffers seemed resigned to falling short. There was talk of how much blame to put on recalcitrant party leaders such as Speaker of the House Paul Ryan or Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Supporters of Trump celebrate election results in Phoenix on Tuesday.\n                \n                    \n                    Ross D.

In the 7 p.m. hour, the news from Florida and North Carolina \u2014 and even Georgia \u2014 suggested that new voters, and especially Hispanics, were giving Clinton a chance to win these states. Had she done so in Florida, she would have reversed the story of the night. As it was, she was within 2 points there. Early returns also showed Clinton prospering in Ohio, another state Trump supposedly had to win to have any chance. There was even a suggestion that Texas would not be a blowout. Texas! The idea of Clinton \"expanding the map\" was back in vogue, and there was renewed talk of the GOP's suicidal failure to reach out to Hispanics, women and young people. Then suddenly Trump's numbers in Florida improved, and those in other states followed suit. Soon the focus shifted to states where Clinton was expected to win, not just compete. And here the Democrats got a shock. Trump had a lead in Virginia well into the evening (before the Northern Virginia suburbs weighed in) and he was doing well in New Hampshire. Even more surprising trends developed in Wisconsin and Michigan, two states that had not gone Republican for president in a generation. Clinton was not reproducing President Obama's 2012 vote totals in Milwaukee and Detroit, or in other Democratic venues. Her campaign's vaunted ground game was apparently not enough to overcome a lack of enthusiasm for her among younger minority voters and the traditional Democratic rank and file. Soon that same contagion spread to Pennsylvania, a state Trump had cultivated throughout the fall. Denied the big payoffs in Florida and elsewhere in the South, Clinton suddenly needed Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania to have a chance of 270 electoral votes. And just as suddenly, she was trailing in all three. The rest of the night was like a bad dream for Democrats. The Senate remained securely in Republican hands, and the House added only a handful of new Democratic seats \u2014 far from the 30 takeaways Democrats needed for control. It was a Republican night. But it was, first, a night for Donald Trump and the voters with whom he locked arms more than a year ago. Together, they are about to redefine at least one of America's two major parties.",

            "article_content": "Clinton weathered a difficult primary and controversy over her emails. But in the end, she ran a race focused on less-than-bold policy prescriptions in a year that could have been a change election.  KELLY MCEVERS, HOST: It is of course election night. We should be getting the first results within an hour. And right now we're going to talk about how we got here. Donald Trump's unexpected rise to the top of the Republican Party has rocked the political system. We will have more on that elsewhere in the program. Now NPR's Tamara Keith has a look at how Hillary Clinton became the first female nominee of a major party and could become the first woman elected president of the United States. TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: If you want to know the kind of campaign Hillary Clinton wanted and expected to run, go back to her first event in April 2015, a roundtable discussion at a community college in Iowa. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) HILLARY CLINTON: I think it's fair to say that as you look across the country, the deck is still stacked in favor of those already at the top. And there's something wrong with that. KEITH: Clinton is by her nature a walk. She seems to thrive on listening to people talk about their concerns and developing public policy that could improve people's lives in ways large and small. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CLINTON: Maybe it is a bit of a woman's thing because we make lists. (CHEERING) CLINTON: We do. We make lists. And we try to write down what we're supposed to do and then cross them off as we go through the day and the week. And so I want you to think about our plans as our lists, our lists as a country. KEITH: And maybe it was the universe's idea funny that this candidate who curls up with briefing books for fun would face an opponent in Donald Trump who simply doesn't bother with the details. Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook says it was the candidate herself who decided the best course to take against Trump. ROBBY MOOK: She also this spring as soon as it was clear that Mr. Trump would be the Republican nominee said straight up that he was unfit to be president. KEITH: This isn't the normal way for a Democratic presidential candidate to run against a Republican, and it made some of her advisers nervous. It wouldn't be the typical fight about abortion rights, the size of government and tax policy. Clinton's decision meant each of Trump's Twitter wars or controversial statements would be added to a larger case she was building, a case she outlined in stark terms on the eve of the California primary in June. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CLINTON: He is not just unprepared. He is temperamentally unfit to hold an office that requires knowledge, stability and immense responsibility. KEITH: There was a risk in this strategy that Trump could stick to the teleprompter and start being more presidential. But Clinton and her team were able to undermine that with a big assist from a man named Khizr Khan on the final night of the Democratic convention. Khan told the story of his son, a soldier killed in combat in Iraq while protecting the others in his unit. The Khan family is Muslim and expressed dismay at the way Trump was talking about Muslims. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KHIZR KHAN: Donald Trump, you're asking Americans to trust you with their future. Let me ask you. Have you even read the United States Constitution? KEITH: He pulled a pocket Constitution out of his suit jacket and changed the course of the presidential race. Trump hit back at Khan and his wife, drawing scorn from Democrats and Republicans alike. Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook says neither Khan nor anyone on the campaign had any idea how much attention that speech would get from the public and Donald Trump. MOOK: For him to show no regard for their sacrifice and attack them simply because he felt like his ego was damaged is - it's just frightening, and I think it was a wake-up call. KEITH: This set up a pattern that would repeat itself throughout the campaign where Trump couldn't help himself from responding to perceived slights and made countless statements insulting immigrants, women, Latinos, all groups who if Clinton pulls off a win tonight will be part of her winning coalition. Clinton's closing message at her final rally of the campaign in the wee hours of this morning spoke of an opponent she couldn't have imagined when she got into the race and one with whom she was able to draw the biggest contrast. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CLINTON: And where we prove conclusively that, yes, love trumps hate. Thank you. Let's go vote, North Carolina. MCEVERS: That was Tamara Keith, and she is with us now from the Javits Center in New York City. That's where Hillary Clinton will spend election night tonight. Hello, Tam. KEITH: Hi. MCEVERS: So how is the Clinton campaign? How are they feeling this evening? KEITH: Well, I spoke with the campaign's political director a few minutes ago, and she said that they're feeling good about Florida. And Florida of course is a big, important swing state and one that they feel if they can pull off a win will really close Donald Trump's options to get to 270 electoral votes. The reason they're feeling good is because there was a strong early voter turnout actually voting early but that it doesn't seem to have taken away from Election Day turnout. They say that as of, you know, 5:30 or so, Florida had already exceeded the voter turnout it had in 2012, and that makes them feel good. They're getting some encouraging signs out of Pennsylvania, New Hampshire and Michigan. Those are states that had very little early voting, basically no early voting. So Election Day is game day, but they're seeing signs that are encouraging. When it comes to Ohio, that's a state that is going to be a nail-biter. But it's a state that they feel confident they can still get to 270 electoral votes without winning it. MCEVERS: You know, talking about how Hillary Clinton has gotten to this point, I mean she is the first woman nominee of major political party. How much have - how important has that been for her supporters? KEITH: You know, there have been times when Hillary Clinton didn't really focus on it as a candidate and when, you know, her supporters felt like they didn't want to vote for Hillary Clinton because she was a woman but for other reasons. And so they had sort of conflicted feelings about it. I think many of those conflicted feelings have passed. And today at the gravesite of Susan B. Anthony, there were people lining up, putting I voted stickers on it. I just think back to a moment in Sacramento, Calif. There was a woman at a rally crying, and I asked her what was wrong, and she just said, it's been a long time coming. MCEVERS: That's NPR's Tamara Keith. We will talk to you again tonight. Thank you very much. KEITH: You're welcome. Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.  Visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.

            "article_content": "Voters in Pennsylvania, Texas and South Carolina weigh in on the end of the 2016 presidential campaign.  AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: It's Election Day. Millions of Americans have voted already, and millions more are at the polls today. KIM CLAY: Our right to vote is one of those rights that our ancestors died for. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Benghazi, abortion, gay marriage - but he's not a politician either, and that probably swung me over. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: I voted for Hillary Clinton, and I came in my pantsuit. And I love it (laughter). UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: Donald Trump's my man, and he's got America's back. CORNISH: NPR is spread out across the country, talking to voters. And we're going to check in with a few of our reporters now. We're going to begin with Don Gonyea in rural Pennsylvania. So, Don, exactly where are you, and what are you hearing from voters? DON GONYEA, BYLINE: I've been driving around a lot of those winding, two-lane roads. The fall colors are fading, but the Donald Trump signs are at peak. I mean this is Donald Trump country out here. I am in far, far southwest Pennsylvania. The fact that there are so many yard signs has prompted people to tell me that that's evidence the polls are wrong or that they're biased. There is some belief, if not confidence, that Trump can score an upset in this blue state. So it's very Republican out here but with lots of working-class Democrats who used to work in steel. Maybe they still work in coal. Trump needs a really big turnout here to offset the Democratic stronghold of Philadelphia which feels a world away from here. So, Audie, it's 7:00 a.m. As polls opened in Westmoreland County, I talked to voters who were up and in line early. Here's what Trump supporter Randy Roble (ph), a 64-year-old retired nurse told me. RANDY ROBLE: I have no friends that voted for Clinton. GONYEA: None. ROBLE: None. I don't know how she's going to bring this country together because there's a lot of divide right now. GONYEA: Can she do anything to reach out to you? ROBLE: I don't think so. GONYEA: So he's very pessimistic about what a President Clinton would mean for him. CORNISH: But it's interesting, Don, because you put this kind of question to people who voted for both candidates, right? I mean essentially, what are you going to do if your candidate doesn't win? What were you hearing? GONYEA: I asked that of everybody. First I was surprised by what I heard. A Clinton supporter said of Trump, I'll have to support him reluctantly. A Trump supporter said, well, you just graciously accept whoever wins because they are our president. But one Trump supporter told me - and this was common - he said he hopes the investigations and grand jury and everything else continue into her emails. CORNISH: Now, I want to go next to Charleston, S.C., and NPR's Debbie Elliott. Debbie, who were you out with today? DEBBIE ELLIOTT, BYLINE: Well, I'm downtown, so I stopped at a charter school. That was the polling site for several precincts here. It was around lunch hour, and there was a line stretching about a block. And it was a very diverse group of voters here. And the overwhelming sentiment was that everybody was ready to have this election behind them. Everyone was really frustrated with their - the tone of this campaign and said that maybe after today, you know, we - they could turn a corner and not have to listen to it anymore. I spoke with Kim Clay (ph). She was a middle-aged African-American woman who came to the polls with her two adult daughters. She's the one we heard earlier saying, you know, the right to vote is sacred because our ancestors died for this. And here's how she voted. CLAY: Hillary Clinton - absolutely. With so much pride, I did. I'm happy just saying her name. I can't wait till the night when I can say Madam President. CORNISH: And Debbie, I... ELLIOTT: Now, Clay is a... CORNISH: Oh, go ahead. ELLIOTT: Oh, she's a retired welder. So she was really enthusiastic about the prospect of the first woman president 'cause she sort of saw herself in a role of an - a non-traditional job as well. But she said she was really disheartened about what she's hearing during this campaign from some of Donald Trump's supporters whom she says feel like they have exclusive ownership of the country, she said, and treat others like second-class citizens. Here's what she said. CLAY: Donald Trump gave them the right and the audacity to speak how they feel. And I've lived through that. And I have grandkids, and I will fight to the death before my grandkids have to live that life again. CORNISH: Now, Debbie, this is an African-American woman - obviously is excited about Hillary Clinton. But South Carolina is essentially a red state, right? ELLIOTT: Yes, and that's not expected to change today. I'm in the city where Hillary Clinton has a little more support. But overall, in rural areas of South Carolina - very conservative and still considered a conservative state. CORNISH: Now, finally I want to go to NPR's John Burnett. He visited south Texas where he's been talking with Latino voters, some unemployed oilfield workers and ranchers. And John, we've been hearing a lot about Texas this election year surprisingly. What have you been hearing? JOHN BURNETT, BYLINE: Hey, Audie. Well, I mean history and the latest polls are telling us that Trump is still heavily favored in this super conservative state. And - but here, as across the country, there has been this record early vote, a big turnout among the Hispanics. They're saying 25 percent higher in the 20 big Texas cities than in 2012. The question - could they flip Texas - that's a real long shot. But I wanted to go to one of those heavily Hispanic regions this morning. And so I chose Frio County, which is an hour southwest of San Antonio. It's about 25 percent Hispanic, typically goes Democrat, went for Obama four years ago. And it was interesting because the Latino voters I spoke to weren't that crazy about Hillary Clinton. They said as Catholics, they really are not crazy about her promotion of abortion rights. But they were really motivated by their deep dislike of Donald Trump. Let's hear from Guadalupe Leal (ph). She's a disabled woman in her 60s. GUADALUPE LEAL: To me, I feel like he's racist not just with Hispanics but also with African-Americans and the low-income people. BURNETT: So that's what Guadaloupe Leal had to say. CORNISH: Now, what did you hear from Trump supporters? BURNETT: Well, almost all the white voters I talked to were in the town of Bigfoot, and there were also some Mexican-Americans in the county seat of Frio County, which is Pearsall. It's part of the Eagle Ford shale oil and gas field which has really fallen on hard times. You can drive around Pearsall, and you can see signs that say oil field workers for Trump. And it's interesting 'cause in south Texas, a lot of oil fields are Latino. So I met an unemployed oil field worker named Amador Luis (ph). He says he's been out of a job for nine months. He just got rehired. AMADOR LUIS: Trump is one that's in favor of the oil field, not like his opponent. I work in the oil field, and a lot of people are saying that she's one to turn off the pumps. And that's something that we don't want. Oil is something that we live on, and you know, that's the way these small towns prosper. BURNETT: So you heard it. This is one of the reasons why we expect Texas to stay red tonight, Audie. CORNISH: John, before I let you go, I want to ask this question because the conversation from Donald Trump about, quote, unquote, \"the wall\" and the border issue's played so much in this election. Did you hear any supporters talking about that? BURNETT: Yes, people all the time talk about illegal immigration and that, you know, he's convinced them that jobs are being lost in Texas and that, you know, there is no border. It really - this state used to be sort of moderate on illegal immigration, very different from Arizona and California. But it's gotten a very hard-edge now I think in part because of the strident tone that Donald Trump has taken. CORNISH: That's NPR's John Burnett in Texas, Debbie Elliott in South Carolina and Don Gonyea in Pennsylvania. Thanks to you all. GONYEA: You're welcome. ELLIOTT: Glad to do it. BURNETT: You bet.

MCEVERS: So how are the folks in the Clinton campaign feeling today? KEITH: You know, it seemed like a load was really lightened on Sunday when the FBI director, James Comey, came out with his letter saying that they - the investigation was back to being undone or back to being done on her emails. But... MCEVERS: Right. KEITH: Also it was just this sense that the finish line was near. So at the end, the campaign really ended joyfully with the plane getting more and more crowded with close friends and high-level campaign aides. And now it's game day. They feel confident in their game plan, in their ground game. Their operation's to get voters out. And they said that at 8:00 a.m., the first volunteer shift had 10,000 people out knocking on doors. MCEVERS: Win or lose tonight, you know, Hillary Clinton has already made history by being the first woman nominee of a major political party. I mean how much of a thing has that really been for her supporters up till now? KEITH: Well, you know, right at this moment, I am seated in the Javits Center, which is a convention center. But it also happens to be a building that has a very large glass ceiling. And the symbolism is not lost on anyone. MCEVERS: (Laughter) Nice. KEITH: So over the course of the campaign, sometimes it got lost. You know, this was a long, hard slog for Hillary Clinton. And she didn't want to focus on making history. But there were moments. Like, right before she clinched the nomination, she was campaigning in California. I was in Sacramento at a rally, and a woman standing next to me at the back of the room just started sobbing. And I asked her what was wrong, and she said it's been a long time coming. And then today out at Susan B. Anthony's grave site in Rochester, N.Y., people have been lining up to put I voted stickers on her gravesite. And of course she was a leader in the women's suffrage movement. MCEVERS: That's NPR's Tamara Keith. We of course will be talking to you a lot this evening. Thanks so much. KEITH: You're welcome so much. Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

The United States could potentially elect its first female president in less than a week. And if Hillary Clinton does win, subsequent Democratic gains in Congress could also usher a record number of women into the House and Senate. \"If what is going on at the top of the ticket drives a big turnout for Democratic candidates, then Democratic women will fare well who are running down ballot,\" said Debbie Walsh, director of the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University's Eagleton Institute of Politics. Still, the gains are likely to be minimal and not close to reflecting the U.S. population. Out of the 100 U.S. senators, there are just 20 women. It's likely the number of women in the Senate will grow, possibly to up to 23 seats. But women make up more than half the country and have been a majority of the electorate in every presidential election since 1984. In the House, there are currently just 84 women out of 435 members. The gains among women in the House are likely to be minimal, ranging from the possibility of a small decline (if Democratic women lose a handful of toss-up races) to a gain of about five. \"The pace of change is just glacial,\" Walsh said. \"At no level of office in the country do we have over 25 percent of women in service. There's still a lot of work to be done.\" The good news is that a record number of 40 women filed to run for the Senate this year (15 won their primaries). A total of 272 women filed to run for the House, and a new record of 167 women won their primaries, narrowly passing the past benchmark set in 2012, according to data from Rutgers. State legislatures would also see an uptick in more women, too. There are a record 2,602 women running for state legislative seats, surpassing the previous record by 65, according to data from Rutgers. Women could set new records for representation at the state level \u2014 currently that's at 1,805 women, just shy of a quarter of all legislators. \"Perhaps this year's step upward will mean resumed progress toward better representation for women in statehouses around the country. Women are more than half the population, so we would certainly expect women to be more than a quarter of state legislators,\" Walsh said in a statement. Where the gains could come from As we noted earlier this year, if Democrats do win the Senate, it will be because of their female recruits in many of the top races. Although female incumbents are retiring in Maryland and California (and Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., is guaranteed to be replaced by a woman), in Illinois, it looks like a near certainty that Democratic Rep. Tammy Duckworth will beat GOP Sen. Mark Kirk, which would keep the Democratic baseline at 20. 2016 could see a record number of women elected to the Senate.\n                \n                    \n                    Jessica Taylor/Vital Statistics, Brookings Institution\n                    \n                \nhide caption To gain the majority, wins by Democratic women in Pennsylvania (former state environmental chief Katie McGinty) and North Carolina (former state Rep. Deborah Ross) would make that possible. Democrats would like to hold Nevada to boost their overall number in the Senate. A win by former Attorney General Catherine Cortez Masto gives them another woman in the Senate. She would also be the first Latina elected to the chamber. New Hampshire features two women running against each other. So that race won't change the number of women in the Senate, but a win by Democratic Gov. Maggie Hassan over GOP Sen. Kelly Ayotte would give Democrats a boost. If Democrats do control the Senate, there could be more committee chairwomen as well. Currently, only one woman heads a Senate committee (Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski on Energy and Natural Resources). But there are several more women who are ranking members on key committees and could be in line if the balance of power shifts. Democrats could make gains among House women, too. There are currently 62 Democratic women and 22 Republicans. While 11 women are retiring from the House or leaving for other reasons, potential new members \u2014 and some in very competitive contests \u2014 are likely to make up that gap, and then some. Top races in New Hampshire, Florida, Iowa, Maine, Nevada, Minnesota and New York will help determine not only how many women are in the 116th Congress but also how much Democrats are able to cut into the GOP's 30-seat House majority. (See our list of the top 40 House races for more on these contests). Republican women look to make up ground Any gains are likely to skew toward Democrats, which makes some sense, because women tend to vote somewhat more Democratic. And, Walsh noted, Republican women could see their numbers dip, putting pressure on the GOP to try to catch up somehow in the future. The problem for Republican women has been a decades-long lack of infrastructure helping both recruit and boost women, compared with EMILY's List, a Democratic group, which was founded over 30 years ago to boost pro-abortion-rights female candidates. Republicans are looking to catch up, though. Maggie's List was founded in 2010 to help recruit and fund female candidates who are fiscally conservative and support strong national security, though it does not have a litmus test on social issues like abortion. This year, the organization is backing more than 30 incumbents and challengers. The GOP group didn't endorse in the presidential race, but Maggie's List Executive Director Missy Shorey argued that one way to try to counter some of the rhetoric of this election is to work on electing more Republican women. \"There are less [GOP women], but that doesn't mean we're any less potent,\" Shorey told NPR. \"Especially given the tone and tenor of this campaign, it's critical to have women on both sides of the aisle. That's how we raise the sensitivity.\" She continued, \"Will we need to look back as a nation, as women, as leaders and as conservatives and learn from the election results on Wednesday morning? Absolutely. And what we need to do is assess what is the best way to move forward to keep this conversation going.\" Democratic groups look to seize their moment For EMILY's List, this moment has been years in the making, and several of the women who could win Senate seats, like Hassan and Cortez Masto, have long been working with the group in state races. \"This is decades of work to help raise women's voices and make sure that women are represented in all levels of government,\" said Rachel Thomas, a spokeswoman for EMILY's List. And the opportunity they're on the cusp of, Thomas and other Democratic women say, has been made more likely by a polarizing GOP nominee who has said controversial things about women, was caught on tape in 2005 describing how he would grope and kiss women unwanted and has almost a dozen women coming forward to accuse him of improper behavior. \"I do think that this is a moment for women, not just running for office, but for issues that matter to women,\" Thomas said. \"We could not have a more clear or stark contrast between these two presidential candidates.\" Planned Parenthood is also deploying a massive ground-game effort and digital campaign in the final days to help boost Clinton and other female Senate candidates. They're doing so in places like New Hampshire, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Nevada, along with targeting several House races and state legislative chambers, where they fear GOP majorities could pass more legislation to block access to contraceptives and abortion. Deirdre Schifeling, executive director of Planned Parenthood Action Fund, said that having more women's voices in office is critical to protecting women's health care access by putting forward voices who have had these real-life experiences. \"Women have a personal experience of needing to make sure that they have birth control all the time, and a personal experience of what it means to make a decision, to have a baby, to have a pregnancy or not,\" Schiefeling said. \"I think it's just a different lived experience.\"",

On a recent, rainy Tuesday night, a surprisingly big crowd \u2014 a few hundred people \u2014 gather in an auditorium at Hutchinson Community College to watch the Kansas Supreme Court hear oral arguments. The justices slowly walk out in their robes and sit on a raised podium. It looks a little goofy, like a community theater production of a trial. But that auditorium is a real courtroom. The Kansas Supreme Court has been holding hearings in public places across the state for a few years now, in an effort to demystify the court and show Kansans what they do. Megan Storie, a criminal justice major who hopes to be an attorney, is really pumped to be here. \"This is something that I'm really passionate about. I love law, and everything that has to do with it,\" she says. But Storie is not sure how she'll vote in the state's upcoming judicial election \u2014 or even how she should go about picking a judge. And that's the question at the center of this election and those in other states: Should judges be impartial arbiters? Or are they accountable to the people who elect them? Chief Justice Lawton Nuss takes notes during arguments before the Kansas Supreme Court in Topeka, Kan., on Dec. 14, 2015. Nuss faces a retention election this year \u2014 and an unprecedented campaign to vote him out of office.\n                \n                    \n                    Orlin Wagner/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Chief Justice Lawton Nuss takes notes during arguments before the Kansas Supreme Court in Topeka, Kan., on Dec. 14, 2015. Nuss faces a retention election this year \u2014 and an unprecedented campaign to vote him out of office. Across the country, judicial elections such as the one coming up in Kansas have become increasingly political. In Kansas \u2014 and 15 other states \u2014 voters don't elect their Supreme Court justices. But once they're in, voters go to the polls to decide whether to keep them. For decades, the majority of Kansans have voted yes, to keep their judges. In fact, no Kansas Supreme Court justice has ever been voted out. But this year, as with national politics, the script has been thrown out, and with this election, the Kansas Supreme Court could completely change, with five out of seven justices up for election. Alicia Bannon, who monitors state courts at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law, has noticed a dramatic shift across the country as judicial elections have become more partisan and negative. \"It's essentially created an arms race, where you have a lot of money going in and interest groups basically trying to shape who's sitting on the courts and the decision that the courts are making,\" Bannon says. Kansas used to be immune to these trends. The Supreme Court judges are selected by a nonpartisan nominating commission and appointed by the governor. Then, every six years Kansans vote on whether to retain the judges. Decades ago, Kansas adopted the merit system as a way to keep politics out of the judiciary. But this year, the judiciary is right back in the middle of a political firefight, with concerted efforts to oust four of the five judges who are up for election. Several groups in Kansas are campaigning heavily in this election. One is Kansans for Life, the state's most vocal anti-abortion organization.The backroom of its Wichita office smells like cardboard. There are boxes everywhere \u2014 mailers, door hangers, postcards and signs. Officer manager Susan Guthrie holds up a glossy yard sign with a big yellow gavel on it. It reads: \"Vote No on Activist Judges.\" In the coming weeks, Kansans for Life plans to make thousands of calls and distribute about 200,000 door hangers. David Gittrich, one of the leaders of Kansans for Life, says his priority is to get justices on the bench who won't throw out the anti-abortion bills his organization supports. \"So if all of our bills are going to end up in court, then we at least should make sure that we have a fair hearing in court,\" Gittrich says. In addition to working to unseat some of the current judges, Kansans for Life would like the state to go a step further and change the way it selects judges. Gittrich prefers elections. \"If we had open elections, I am pretty sure every member of the courts would be conservative and think pro-life was a good thing, because the people of Kansas think pro-life is a good thing,\" he says. Susan Guthrie works for Kansans for Life, the state's most vocal anti-abortion organization and one of the groups campaigning against some of the Supreme Court justices up for re-election.\n                \n                    \n                    Ashley Cleek for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Susan Guthrie works for Kansans for Life, the state's most vocal anti-abortion organization and one of the groups campaigning against some of the Supreme Court justices up for re-election. The Kansas Legislature has floated bills that would change the way justices are selected in the state. None have passed. There are also groups urging voters to vote yes and keep their judges, including four former Kansas governors \u2014 two Republicans and two Democrats. In this cacophony of voices and campaigns, the justices remain silent. Ethically, they can't campaign. They can't say \"vote for me\" or publicly take positions on issues. All they can do is give speeches at Rotary clubs and chat with people after public hearings, like the ones in Hutchinson. Chief Justice Lawton Nuss \u2014 one of the justices being targeted for ouster \u2014 says it's a good thing judges can't campaign. \"The U.S. Supreme Court said judges need to be indifferent to popularity. They are not politicians; they don't do what the people want, 'cause what the people want can change from week to week, month to month, year to year,\" he says., However Kansans vote this Nov. 8, Nuss says, they should be proud of their judiciary and safeguard it from politics.

Arizona's Santa Cruz County on the Mexican border is what Republican operative Sergio Arellano jokingly calls \"Democrat heaven.\" Only 16 percent of voters are registered as Republicans. More than 80 percent of the population is Latino. Arellano has been trying to lure more of these voters to the GOP, but this campaign season has been tricky. \"What we encounter on the grass-roots is, 'Republicans are racist. Republicans and Trump want to deport everybody, want to build the wall,'\" said Arellano. Arellano, who is 33 and the son of Mexican immigrants, pushes back on this characterization of his party. He tells people a secure border will also protect Mexican migrants from being exploited or kidnapped by criminal organizations. He emphasizes that Republicans stand for creating opportunity and jobs. \"Jobs, jobs, jobs is what we're standing firm with, and that's what the people want,\" said Arellano, who works for the Republican National Committee and Arizona Republican Party. Arellano and his fellow Republicans need every vote they can find in Arizona this year. The growing Latino electorate here is credited with helping to turn conservative Arizona into a potential swing state this cycle. Arizona last voted for a Democratic presidential candidate in 1996, but Hillary Clinton's campaign is spending millions there and sending high-profile surrogates to win the state away. Challenging Democratic control The new Republican campaign office in downtown Nogales.\n                \n                    \n                    Jude Joffe-Block/KJZZ\n                    \n                \nhide caption The new Republican campaign office in downtown Nogales. Last month, the Arizona Republican Party opened a campaign field office here in the city of Nogales less than a mile from the border with Mexico. It's the first time in recent memory Republicans have made such an effort in this area where Democrats have long maintained local control. \"The vote is taken for granted by Democrats,\" Arellano said about Santa Cruz County. \"We're here to bring an alternative point of view.\" Arellano and his team go door to door talking to voters. They are targeting infrequent voters, independents, Republicans and conservative Democrats. A first-time voter named Blanca Castro answers the door, and Arellano fluidly switches into Spanish to ask whom she is supporting. Castro said she is from Mexico and recently naturalized. She is backing Clinton. Arellano tells her Donald Trump will bring jobs, but Castro isn't persuaded. And that's hardly surprising. Some polls show fewer than 20 percent of Latinos support the Republican nominee. Many have not forgiven Trump for saying that Mexico is sending rapists and criminals across the border. \"You have to understand, I'm Mexican, and at least Clinton isn't racist,\" Castro said. However, Castro does support a local Republican candidate for county supervisor. Arellano has heard it all before. In his book, this interaction was a partial success. \"Democrat for president, Republican for supervisor,\" Arellano said of Castro's picks. Some GOP gains with Latinos The Republican supervisor candidate in this district is Mike Melendez, a recent convert to the GOP. Melendez can often be found at the party's brand new Nogales campaign office. He owns the building and sells crafts from his native Mexico out of this store, but this campaign season he is renting out much of it to the Arizona Republican Party. Mike Melendez is a Republican candidate for county supervisor. He sells Mexican crafts and rented out the rest of his store to the Arizona Republican Party.\n                \n                    \n                    Jude Joffe-Block/KJZZ\n                    \n                \nhide caption Mike Melendez is a Republican candidate for county supervisor. He sells Mexican crafts and rented out the rest of his store to the Arizona Republican Party. Displays of colorful Mexican tiles, mirrors and metal animals still greet visitors when they first walk in. Occasionally tourists wander in to shop. A handful of volunteers, most of them young, Latino and bilingual, made phone calls to voters. Outside, the slogan \"Jobs, Jobs, Jobs\" is hand-painted in colorful letters along with the American flag and names of Republican candidates. Melendez is sick of what he says is a sluggish economy here in Nogales. The three current county supervisors are all Democrats. Melendez is challenging a long-term incumbent. He believes there are more Latinos like him ready to switch parties because they haven't been properly introduced to the Republican Party. \"I didn't understand why was I a Democrat,\" Melendez said. \"Because everybody here locally was Democrat or still thinks that they are, but they are thinking Republican, family values and for pro-life.\" That's the same message Sergio Arellano brings to voters when he goes door to door. He likes to say Latinos are Republicans, but just don't know it yet. At one house, a 20-year-old named Yolanda Mejia came to the door. She is Mexican-American and an independent. She wears a uniform for her waitressing job at a local sports bar. \"I always said that if Bernie never made it I was just going to go for Trump, because he is a better alternative than Hillary,\" Mejia said. Bingo. Arellano invites Mejia to come down to the campaign office and join his team. \"I feel happy,\" Arellano said leaving Mejia's house. \"Pretty good. But I don't want her to stop at Trump. I want her to fill out the whole ballot Republican.\" No matter what happens in the presidential race, Arellano hopes his work will build inroads for the GOP with Latinos in this part of Arizona.",

ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: At the presidential debate last night, Donald Trump would not commit to accepting the outcome of the presidential election. For a couple of weeks, he has put forth claims of a rigged election without providing any proof, and today Trump addressed that topic again. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DONALD TRUMP: I would like to promise and pledge to all of my voters and supporters and to all of the people of the United States that I will totally accept the results of this great and historic presidential election if I win. (CHEERING) SIEGEL: Well, to talk about all of that and the rest of last night's debate, we're joined now by NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson. Hi, Mara. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Hi, Robert. SIEGEL: And let's start with Donald Trump. Did that speech today settle it? LIASSON: I don't think so. That remark last night that he might not accept the results of the election contradicted what his campaign manager said and his running mate and his daughter said that he should accept the results. Today, as you heard, he walked it back a bit. He said of course he'd abide by the laws of the country, and he reserves the right to challenge the results. And of course he has that right as any candidate does. But he did go on to say, as he has done in the past, that there is a possibility of massive voter fraud in the country. And in the past he's said the only way he can lose is if the election is stolen from him. So he walked it back a bit, but that's still the headline. And it overshadowed some other things he did last night when he sounded like a traditional Republican candidate on abortion and guns and taxes. He was much more disciplined and focused in the debate. He does still have one inexplicable divergence from Republican orthodoxy, which is Russia. Even though he's gotten the intelligence briefings and he knows that 17 intelligence agencies say that Russian security agencies were behind the hacks of Democratic officials' emails, he still continues to take the Putin line. SIEGEL: Well, let's take those things together - Trump going against the norm on accepting election results and going against the consensus on whether Russia hacked into American political systems. Yesterday you said that you were looking to see what Trump's strategy is. Does that give you any insight to what his strategy is? LIASSON: Not too much, but there is one theory out there, which is, he is sticking with the strategy that has worked for him for decades and decades, which is dominate the media; make as much news as possible; keep the spotlight on yourself. Maybe, this theory goes, he is establishing himself as the alternative to everything, the alternative to the establishment, to the media, to Hillary. If as many have been speculating he wants to start Trump TV after the election, this was a pretty good debut of someone who wants to keep the spotlight on him, and maybe this is going to be his new brand. Now, that would be a good strategy for that end, but for getting 270 electoral votes - not so much. SIEGEL: Hillary Clinton, on the other hand, seems to be pretty confident that she's going to win the election. She is no longer just trying to win enough states to get to 270 electoral votes. She's now investing in Arizona, Missouri, Indiana, even Texas, traditionally red states. What's the idea there? LIASSON: The idea obviously is to win as big as possible, hoping if she can to help some down-ballot Democratic candidates. Of course we don't see any evidence of a big wave developing beneath the presidential race. She also wants to shut down any talk that he might pursue that the election was stolen from him, which will be a heck of a lot easier to do if the election is very, very close. And she also wants to get a mandate. But of course getting a mandate is not necessarily synonymous with just winning big. SIEGEL: Well, did Hillary Clinton successfully describe last night what she would actually do as president if she were to get that mandate? LIASSON: I don't think she did. She closed by saying she's fought all her life for women and families. That's a testimonial. That's not necessarily telling people exactly what to expect if they elect you. That's how you get a mandate - by running on a very clear, understandable agenda so when people vote for you, they know they're voting for universal health care reform or debt-free college or a tax cut and not just as the lesser of two evils. She has done an excellent job of being the anti-Trump and disqualifying him, but she has yet to make a real positive affirmative case for herself, present a vision, why she wants to be president and what she's going to do. And maybe she'll do that in the closing weeks. SIEGEL: OK. That's NPR's Mara Liasson in Las Vegas. Mara, thanks. LIASSON: Thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

In the final presidential debate, Donald Trump said he supports the federal ban on \"partial-birth\" abortion because, under the procedure, \"in the ninth month you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb of the mother.\" He added that this can happen \"as late as one or two or three or four days prior to birth.\" But that is not at all likely. Some 90 percent of abortions take place in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports abortion rights. Only about 1.5 percent of abortions take place 20 weeks or later after conception. Of those, the vast majority happen before 24 weeks. Under the current federal ban, a dilation and extraction (D&X), or intact dilation and evacuation (D&E) \u2014 what opponents call \"partial-birth\" abortion \u2014 is still allowed if the life of the mother is at stake. Few providers perform it and the exact number of procedures is not known, but it's believed to be small. In fact, at one point, members of Congress tried to ban D&X procedures that would take place after a fetus is considered viable. But abortion opponents complained that would have kept most such procedures legal. So-called partial-birth abortion involves dilating a woman's cervix to remove a fetus intact, pulling its entire body out through the birth canal. In 2003, President George W. Bush signed a law banning the procedure, imposing a fine and imprisonment for any physician who \"knowingly performs a partial-birth abortion and thereby kills a human fetus.\" The U.S. Supreme Court upheld it in 2007. Nineteen states have their own such bans, while 43 states impose some kind of restriction on abortions later in pregnancy. When she was a U.S. senator, Hillary Clinton voted against the partial-birth abortion ban. In last night's debate, she said she opposed it because it did not include an exception to protect the health of the mother. She said she has met with women who learned late in a pregnancy \"that their health is in jeopardy if they continue to carry to term\" or \"that something terrible has happened or just been discovered about the pregnancy.\" Providers say that often means a severe fetal abnormality. According to the landmark ruling Roe v. Wade, any restriction on abortion must include an exception to protect the health of the mother, both physical and mental. A number of lower courts ruled the partial-birth ban was unconstitutional because it did not do that. President Bill Clinton also vetoed the measure twice. But, in a move that one liberal justice called \"alarming,\" the Supreme Court ruled the health exception was not needed in this case. It said there were questions about the safety of a D&X procedure and that there are alternative ways to terminate a pregnancy. Last night, Trump called the procedure \"not acceptable,\" but that's a change in position. When asked on Meet the Press in 1999 if a President Trump would ban partial-birth abortion, he said no. He said he \"hated\" abortion, but since he had grown up in New York, \"I am pro-choice in every respect.\"",

            "article_content": "The final presidential debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump was overall more cordial and more policy-focused than their nasty second debate faceoff. But the stunning moment that will stand out is the GOP nominee's statement that he won't necessarily accept the results of the election on Nov. 8. \"I will tell you at the time,\" Trump said in a shocking statement that signals a break from the traditional transfer of power. \"I will keep you in suspense.\" His hard-line stance came after a week in which he has ramped up talk that the election is \"rigged\" in favor of Clinton, even as national polls and surveys in battleground states show the Democratic nominee opening up a consistent lead. But both Trump's daughter Ivanka and his running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, have said recently that Trump would accept the election results. The Las Vegas debate, moderated by Chris Wallace of Fox News, focused more on issues facing the country compared with the two previous events. Wallace opened by asking the candidates about the Supreme Court and their positions on gun control and abortion, and he also delved into their plans for immigration reform and the economy. The two candidates did have bitter exchanges over the allegations from multiple women who say Trump groped them or made unwanted sexual advances. The GOP nominee pressed Clinton again on her deleted emails from her private server when she was at the State Department. He frequently interrupted her, and even at the end of the debate, interjected that she was a \"nasty woman.\" Here are some of the key moments of the debate: A huge cloud that hung over the past week were Trump's repeated claims that the election is \"rigged.\" While Pence has said that the campaign will accept the results on Nov. 8, Trump struck a very different and shocking tone on Wednesday night. \"I will look at it at the time,\" Trump said. When pressed by Wallace, the reality TV star responded, \"What I'm saying now is I will tell you at the time. I will keep you in suspense, OK?\" \"That's horrifying,\" Clinton responded. \"You know, every time Donald thinks things are not going in his direction, he claims whatever it is, is rigged against him,\" she continued. \"The FBI conducted a yearlong investigation into my emails. They concluded there was no case. He said that the FBI was rigged. He lost the Iowa caucus; he lost the Wisconsin primary. He said the Republican primary was rigged against him. Then Trump University gets sued for fraud and racketeering. He claims the court system and the federal judge is rigged against him. There was even a time when he didn't get an Emmy for his TV program three years in a row and he started tweeting that the Emmys were rigged.\" \"Should have gotten it,\" Trump interjected, still apparently holding a grudge for the snub of The Apprentice. On the story that has consumed the last week of the campaign \u2014 the multiple women who have come forward to charge that Trump once groped or kissed them without permission \u2014 Trump said their claims had been \"largely debunked\" and that he didn't know any of the women. \"I have a feeling how they came. I believe it was her campaign that did it,\" Trump said, adding that his opponent was also behind a Chicago rally he held earlier this year that was disrupted by violence. Trump claimed the women \"want either fame or her campaign did it and I think it's her campaign.\" \"Donald thinks belittling women makes him bigger,\" Clinton said in one of her strongest moments of the debate. \"He goes after their dignity, their self-worth, and I don't think there is a woman anywhere who doesn't know what that feels like.\" She continued: \"So we now know what Donald thinks and what he says and how he acts toward women. That's who Donald is. I think it's really up to all of us to demonstrate who we are and who our country is, and to stand up and be very clear about what we expect from our next president, how we want to bring our country together, where we don't want to have the kind of pitting of people one against the other where instead we celebrate our diversity, we lift people up, and we make our country even greater. America is great because America is good. And it really is up to all of us to make that true now and in the future and particularly for our children and our grandchildren.\" \"Nobody has more respect for women than I do, nobody,\" Trump said, a frequent refrain of his throughout the campaign. \"Nobody has more.\" The audience began to laugh at that statement, and moderator Chris Wallace had to quiet it down. The debate kicked off with a discussion between the candidates of what kind of justices they would appoint to the Supreme Court, showcasing a wide divide between them on two of the most hot-button issues \u2014 gun control and abortion. Clinton said she would appoint justices who would \"stand up on behalf of women's rights [and] on behalf of the rights of the LGBT community\" and would overturn the Citizens United decision, which allowed for \"dark, unaccountable money\" in politics. Trump said that \"the Supreme Court is what it's all about\" and that he would nominate justices who are \"pro-life, have a conservative bent, will protect the Second Amendment and interpret the Constitution the way the Founders wanted it.\" Clinton said that her position on gun control had been misconstrued. \"There's no doubt that I respect the Second Amendment. That I also believe there's an individual right to bear arms. That is not in conflict with sensible, common-sense regulation,\" she said. Clinton explained that she was upset over the District of Columbia v. Heller decision because the nation's capital was trying to protect toddlers who might injure themselves or others from guns. \"I see no conflict between saving people's lives and defending the Second Amendment,\" the Democratic nominee said. On abortion, Clinton reaffirmed her support for a \"woman's right to choose\" and explained why she supported late abortions, arguing that such \"cases that fall at the end of pregnancy are often the most heartbreaking, painful decisions for families to make\" and that the government shouldn't be regulating \"those most personal decisions.\" Trump called it a terrible thing \"to think you can rip the baby out of the womb of the mother, just prior to the birth.\" Trump said he was \"pro-life\" and that the justices he would nominate are all \"pro-life.\" Even when pressed by Wallace, he wouldn't say whether he wants Roe v. Wade to be overturned. But he did say that the justices he would appoint would overturn Roe and the decision would be sent back to the states. Trump's promise to deport immigrants in the U.S. illegally and build a massive wall along the Mexican border has been one of his signature issues of this campaign. He repeated the need for strict border controls during the debate: \"In the audience tonight we have four mothers of, I mean these are unbelievable people that I've gotten to know over a period of years, whose children have been killed, brutally killed, by people that came into the country illegally. You have thousands of mothers and fathers and relatives all over the country. They are coming in illegally. Drugs are pouring in through the border. We have no country if we have no border. Hillary wants to give amnesty she wants to have open borders.\" And he also argued that the border problem was contributing to the drug and opioid crisis in the country by allowing them to pour over the border. \"We're going to get them out, we're going to secure the border, and once the border is secured, at a later date, we'll make a determination as to the rest, but we have some bad hombres here, and we're going to get them out,\" Trump said. That comment quickly blew up on social media after the debate, with many interpreting it as a racial slur. Clinton said she didn't want to \"rip families apart. I don't want to be sending parents away from children. I don't want to see the deportation force that Donald has talked about in action in our country.\" Clinton pointed out that she voted for increased border security as a senator and that any violent person should be deported. \"I think we are both a nation of immigrants and we are a nation of laws, and that we can act accordingly and that's why I am introducing comprehensive immigration reform within the first hundred days with a path to citizenship,\" Clinton promised. The relatively cordial discussion on immigration reform quickly devolved into talk of the email hack into Clinton's campaign chairman's account that U.S. intelligence has said was done by Russian entities. \"They have hacked American websites, American accounts of private people, of institutions, then they have given that information to WikiLeaks for the purpose of putting it on the Internet,\" Clinton said. \"This has come from the highest levels of the Russian government, clearly from Putin himself.\" Trump, who has praised Putin repeatedly throughout the campaign, said, \"I don't know Putin. He said nice things about me. If we got along well that would be good. If Russia and the United States got along well and went after ISIS, that would be good. He has no respect for her. He has no respect for our president. And I'll tell you what, we're in very serious trouble.\" Clinton shot back: \"Well, that's because he'd rather have a puppet for president than the United States and it's pretty clear.\" Trump interrupted: \"No puppet. You're the puppet.\" And as to U.S. intelligence reports that the hacking came from Russia, Trump said Clinton has \"no idea whether it's Russia, China or anybody else.\" \"Do you doubt 17 military and civilian agencies, as well?\" Clinton asked incredulously. \"He'd rather believe Vladimir Putin than the military and civilian intelligence professionals who are sworn to protect us. I find that just absolutely striking.\" Then it was Trump's turn: \"She doesn't like Putin because Putin has outsmarted her at every step of the way, excuse me. Putin has outsmarted her in Syria, he has outsmarted her every step of the way.\" But Trump later did say that he would \"of course\" condemn Russia if it was behind the hacks. The two also defended their own family's charitable endeavors. Clinton argued there was no conflict of interest between the Clinton Foundation and her work at the State Department. \"It is a world-renowned charity, and I am so proud of the work that it does,\" she said, detailing the work it does to provide HIV/AIDS treatment. Trump responded that it was a \"criminal enterprise\" that accepted foreign money from countries that don't protect women's rights and LGBT rights. \"I was at Little Haiti the other day in Florida and I want to tell you they hate the Clintons,\" he said. \"Because what happened in Haiti with the Clinton Foundation is a disgrace.\" But speaking about his own foundation, Trump said \"100 percent\" of the money \"goes to different charities including a lot of military. I don't get anything; I don't buy boats, I don't buy planes.\" However, reporting from the Washington Post during the campaign has shown Trump last contributed to the foundation in 2008 and that he has used foundation money to pay legal bills and to buy a portrait of himself. Clinton used this as a chance to attack Trump over not releasing his tax returns, a break from every other modern presidential candidate. He defended a tax loophole that allowed him to not pay federal income taxes for almost two decades. \"Hillary, what you should've done, you should've changed the law when you were a United States senator. Because your donors and your special interests are doing the same thing as I do, except even more so.\"",

            "article_content": "Although Donald Trump's rhetoric has alienated many Latino voters, Arizona's Republican Party is still trying to woo Latino voters along the Mexican border.  ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: This week, Michelle Obama, Chelsea Clinton and Bernie Sanders are paying visits to Arizona. They're campaigning for Hillary Clinton. Latino voters have put that one solidly Republican state in play. Arizona Republicans are trying to woo Latinos, but they're finding that's a challenge with Donald Trump at the top of their ticket. Jude Joffe-Block of member station KJZZ reports. JUDE JOFFE-BLOCK, BYLINE: Here in Arizona's Santa Cruz County on the Mexican border, more than 80 percent of the population is Latino, but only 16 percent of voters are registered as Republicans. Thirty-three year old Sergio Arellano has been trying to lure more of these voters to the GOP, but this year has been tricky. SERGIO ARELLANO: What we encounter on the grassroots is, Republicans are racist; Republicans and Trump wants to deport everybody, want to build a wall. JOFFE-BLOCK: Arellano is the son of Mexican immigrants and works for both the Republican National Committee and state party. He wants to spread the message that Republicans are about opportunity and jobs. ARELLANO: (Speaking Spanish). BLANCA CASTRO: (Speaking Spanish). ARELLANO: (Speaking Spanish). JOFFE-BLOCK: We're going door to door in the border city Nogales. First-time voter Blanca Castro. answers. She's from Mexico and recently naturalized. She tells Arellano she backs Clinton. ARELLANO: (Speaking Spanish). JOFFE-BLOCK: Arellano tries to tell her Donald Trump will bring jobs. ARELLANO: (Speaking Spanish). JOFFE-BLOCK: But Castro isn't convinced, and that's hardly surprising. Some polls show fewer than 20 percent of Latinos support the Republican nominee. Many Latinos have not forgiven Trump for saying that Mexico is sending rapists and criminals across the border. CASTRO: (Speaking Spanish). JOFFE-BLOCK: Castro says, \"you have to understand. I'm Mexican, and at least Clinton isn't racist.\" However she does vow to support a local Republican candidate for county supervisor. As we walk away, we can overhear Castro's family inside the house talking and laughing. Were they talking trash about Trump? ARELLANO: The husband was talking about - that you should have told them that Trump is a crook. JOFFE-BLOCK: Still, in Arellano's book, this interaction was a partial success. ARELLANO: Democrat for president, Republican for supervisor. JOFFE-BLOCK: Hello, may I speak with... That supervisor candidate is himself a recent convert to the GOP. I met him at the party's brand new campaign office in Nogales, the first of its kind here in this strongly Democratic county. MIKE MELENDEZ: My name is Mike Melendez, and I'm running for Supervisor District 1 here in Santa Cruz County. JOFFE-BLOCK: Inside the office, a handful of volunteers, most of them Latino and bilingual, make phone calls to voters. The office doubles as a store where Melendez sells crafts from his native Mexico. He says there are more Latinos like him ready to be flipped. MELENDEZ: I didn't understand why was I a Democrat, so - because everybody here locally was Democrat or still thinks that they are, but they're thinking Republican - family values and pro-life. JOFFE-BLOCK: Meanwhile Sergio Arellano continues his quest to persuade these voters. Twenty-year-old Yolanda Mejia, an independent, answers the door. YOLANDA MEJIA: I just always said that if Bernie never made it, that I was just going to vote for Trump because he's a better alternative than Hillary. JOFFE-BLOCK: Bingo. Arellano invites her to join his team. ARELLANO: I feel happy. It's pretty good, but I don't want her to stop at Trump. I want her to fill out the whole ballot Republican. JOFFE-BLOCK: No matter what happens in the presidential race, Arellano hopes his work will build inroads for the GOP with Latinos in this part of the state.

Voters will vote on a ballot measure that would end the state's current practice of allowing unlimited campaign contributions and reimpose limits of $2,600 per candidate.\n                \n                    \n                    Education Images/UIG via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption The state capitol building in Jefferson City, Missouri. Voters will vote on a ballot measure that would end the state's current practice of allowing unlimited campaign contributions and reimpose limits of $2,600 per candidate. The most expensive race for governor in the country is going on in Missouri. In fact, it's not even close: The more than $50 million spent in Missouri's governor race is more than the combined spending in the Indiana and North Carolina gubernatorial contests, according to the National Institute of Money in State Politics. With no donation limits in Missouri, Democrat Chris Koster and Republican Eric Greitens can pull in checks of unlimited size from donors. Much of the six and seven-figure checks the two candidates received is going toward TV ads, including a memorable one where Greitens literally causes a field to explode with a gun. But this historically expensive governor's race may soon become a thing of the past in Missouri. The state's voters will decide in November whether to put a $2,600 limit on donations to candidates for state office. It's not the only campaign finance measure facing voters this year, ballot measures before voters in South Dakota and Washington State would create systems to publicly finance state elections. \"These candidates are going to have to come to the people to get donations,\" said Todd Jones, an attorney who wrote the text of the donation limit amendment. \"They can't rely on a few individuals in a ... smoke-filled room to fully fund their campaign, which some people have done.\" These candidates are going to have to come to the people to get donations. They can't rely on a few individuals in a ... smoke-filled room to fully fund their campaign. Todd Jones, an attorney who wrote the text of the donation limit amendment Missouri Democrats have been the biggest advocates of ending the unlimited donation system, which started in 2008 under Republican Gov. Matt Blunt. But it was social conservatives who propelled this particular proposal to the ballot. Former Republican gubernatorial candidate and businessman Fred Sauer spent several million dollars to get the donation limit measure before voters. Among other things, Sauer has contended that donors who favor embryonic stem cell research unduly influenced Missouri legislators in the past. And Jones, who has long been in fights against abortion rights and embryonic stem cell research, said the current system is corrosive to the public trust. \"If you give a million dollars to a candidate, whose call are you going to take?\" Jones said. \"Are you going to take mine? Or are you going to take the donor?\" Mixed reaction Since the donation limit amendment doesn't have much organized opposition right now, there's a good chance Missourians will approve it on Nov. 8. The ballot measure also has bipartisan approval from both Democrats and Republicans. Republican Sen. David Pearce voted to get rid of donation limits in 2008. At the time, he hoped that it would make big donations easier to track. But as Pearce prepares to leave office next year, he says voting to create the unlimited system was the worst decision of his legislative career. \"If I could take it back, I would,\" Pearce said. \"Because it's not working. When you have folks that are giving million [dollar] checks, checks for a half-million dollars, $250,000 checks, $100,000 checks \u2013 I think it pollutes the system.\" But some of Pearce's GOP colleagues have a less magnanimous opinion of the proposal. For one thing, it doesn't place any curbs on independent political action committees. Some, like Republican state Senate candidate Bill Eigel, fear that if Missouri adopts contribution limits, the state's campaign finance system will look a lot like the federal system \u2013 and that's not meant as a compliment. \"Because the same amount of money is finding its way into our campaigns at the federal level,\" Eigel said. \"And the same amount of cynicism and negativity still exists as a result of that money that's going into federal campaigns. But what's happened at the federal level, instead of what's being given to candidates where they can report it and there's transparency \u2013 it's funneled into superPACs.\" Even if Missourians approve the amendment, both detractors and supporters believe there will be a legal challenge. Among other things, opponents object to how the amendment would bar certain types of companies from donating to political action committees. Divide in governor's race Meanwhile, both of Missouri's gubernatorial hopefuls \u2013 Republican Eric Greitens and Democrat Chris Koster \u2013 have different philosophical approaches to donation limits. Greitens said earlier this year he opposes contributions curbs \u2013 adding that he doesn't feel that huge contributions he's received inhibits his ability to govern. \"I'm completely new to politics,\" Greitens said. \"This is my first time in. But what I've found is the most important thing is that there's transparency around the money.\" It's clear that regular people in the state feel increasingly disconnected from their political system. Chris Koster, Democratic candidate for governor For at least part of the campaign, Koster agreed with Greitens. He voted to get rid of donation limits in 2008 when he was a Democratic state senator. And throughout the years, he's collected big donations from labor unions and some wealthy businessmen. Although he doesn't plan to unilaterally take smaller donations, Koster threw his support behind contribution limits earlier this summer. He says he's troubled by the size of donations \u2013 and how candidates under a system with no contribution limits still find ways to hide sources of donations. Greitens recently received a nearly $2 million donation from a group called SEALs for Truth. When campaign disclosure reports came out earlier this week, it was revealed that the donor for SEALs for Truth was a nondescript nonprofit called the American Policy Coalition, Inc. \"What we do know is that transparency is not occurring,\" Koster said. \"The contributions have gotten massively larger \u2013 and they are still hidden. It's clear that regular people in the state feel increasingly disconnected from their political system. And it seems to me that this can't go on \u2013 or shouldn't go on at least.\"",

Liberty University is a place where Donald Trump still has a lot of support. But his running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, is the one who seems naturally at home at the Virginia college, in a way the flamboyant New York real estate developer is not. Pence spent Wednesday morning campaigning at the school. In his speech, he alluded to Scripture about sin and redemption as he talked about the scandal surrounding his running mate \u2014 the release of a tape where Trump can be heard explicitly boasting about groping women. \"We're called to aspire to live godly lives, but also we recognize that we all fall short,\" Pence told the audience. It was in stark contrast to Trump's appearance there earlier this year, when he famously flubbed the pronunciation of a book of the Bible \u2014 calling it \"two Corinthians\" instead of \"Second Corinthians.\" Pence is a longtime evangelical, well-versed in the language and theology of this crowd. He argued that Trump has apologized and said it's time to extend to him the Christian virtue of forgiveness. \"It's not about condoning what is said and done; it's about believing in Grace and forgiveness,\" Pence said. \"As Christians, we are called to forgive, even as we've been forgiven.\" Liberty University President Jerry Falwell, Jr., is standing by Trump, but many evangelicals are struggling with that decision. From what I've heard he knows Jesus now, so I'll offer him the same grace God gave him to forgive him for that. Jonathan Ludwig, freshman at Liberty University In recent days, two major conservative Christian publications have written editorials denouncing Trump's words on the 2005 recording. World magazine called on Trump to withdraw as the Republican nominee. And Christianity Today called on evangelicals to confront Trump's moral failings. But for Jonathan Ludwig, a freshman at Liberty University from New Jersey, Pence's call for forgiveness rang true, even though he finds Trump's words about women \"disgusting.\" \"I think that's inappropriate on all levels and it's inexcusable. But I do know this \u2014 that we all sin. We all fall short of the glory of God and we need Jesus and that's just the truth,\" Ludwig said. \"He made those comments 11 years ago and from what I've heard he knows Jesus now, so I'll offer him the same grace God gave him to forgive him for that.\" For his friend Christopher Horton, a freshman from Miami, Trump's character and language have been making him rethink his political loyalties. Bayley Sharp, of Roanoke, Va., poses for a photo at Liberty University in Lynchburg, Va., on Oct. 12.\n                \n                    \n                    Sarah McCammon/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Bayley Sharp, of Roanoke, Va., poses for a photo at Liberty University in Lynchburg, Va., on Oct. 12. \"I have had Republican views since growing up and just recently, I struggle with Donald Trump's comments about women,\" Horton said. \"I don't think he's very professional, and I find it hard to vote for him and have him represent our great nation.\" Horton says he believes Clinton is corrupt \u2014 as Trump often argues \u2014 but he's leaning toward voting for her anyway. Bayley Sharp, a freshman from Roanoke, Va., said she heard the 2005 tape of Trump and wasn't pleased. \"My dad taught me that men should respect women, and the way he was talking about women wasn't respectable,\" Sharp said. \"That shouldn't be what our president should look like.\" But Sharp says she loves Mike Pence and feels better with him on the ticket. She says her opposition to abortion is her top priority in choosing a presidential candidate and Sharp sees Trump as the better of two bad choices. So, she's accepting his apology. \"Right now, I feel like he has apologized for that and he wants to move on from that,\" Sharp said, \"And hopefully he will.\" While abortion may motivate many conservative evangelicals to stick with Trump, it could be harder to persuade moderate voters to forgive and forget --especially with dozens of leaders of Trump's own party calling for him to step aside.",

            "article_content": "Ohio has almost always voted for winning presidential candidates. The state has backed the winner in 28 of the last 30 presidential elections. This year, the race is tight here, with some polls showing Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton modestly ahead and others putting Republican nominee Donald Trump in a slight lead. Though many sectors of the economy have strengthened or recovered in recent years, manufacturing and union jobs have continued to struggle. With a union membership rate above the U.S. rate (Ohio's rate was 12.3 percent in 2015, compared with 11.1 percent in the U.S.), many of the state's workers will cast their ballots with economic policy and jobs in mind. Some traditionally Democratic-leaning union workers are open to considering the Republican nominee. And there's another issue that could sway voters next month: propriety. A video from 2005 was leaked last Friday, showing Trump bragging about groping and kissing women. \"Grab them by the p****. You can do anything,\" the Republican nominee said, using vulgar slang for the female anatomy. The video has led a number of Republican lawmakers to withdraw their support for Trump. It's possible these revelations will further diminish Trump's support among white, suburban women, a key voting group this election year. As part of NPR's Divided States series, Morning Edition traveled to Ohio and met with four voters of different political, religious and socioeconomic backgrounds to understand what issues were important to them ahead of the debate. On the morning after the debate, which included discussion of the 2005 video, we checked back in with them. (Click on the audio above to hear their thoughts on the 2005 video). Two of the voters we spoke with are Clinton supporters, one is a Trump supporter and another is a lifelong Democrat who is leaning toward Trump.

Mike Pence, R-Ind., speak during the vice presidential debate at Longwood University in Farmville, Va.\n                \n                    \n                    Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., left, and Gov. Mike Pence, R-Ind., speak during the vice presidential debate at Longwood University in Farmville, Va. The only vice presidential debate between Democrat Tim Kaine and Republican Mike Pence was a bit more heated than expected. For 90 minutes on Tuesday night they sparred on foreign policy, abortion and immigration. But the biggest shadows hanging over them were their running mates. Pence had to defend many controversial things Donald Trump has said \u2014 and often he outright denied Trump had said those things, even though video evidence shows otherwise. Kaine tried to be an attack dog and go after Trump on his taxes, but he also was on the defensive over Hillary Clinton's email server and her struggles to connect with voters. Overall, the fiery debate wasn't very disciplined, and both men deviated from the questions moderator Elaine Quijano of CBS News asked. But it was still a far more cordial affair than the bitter match-up Trump and Clinton had just over a week ago \u2014 and will likely be more civil than their next two. We recapped the full debate and its biggest moments, and NPR's politics and policy reporters also fact-checked the debate in real-time. Below are videos of five highlights and most talked-about moments. 'You Whipped Out That Mexican Thing Again' Unfortunately for Pence, a rather strong performance from the Indiana governor \u2014 who proved he has a future in politics win or lose this November \u2014 was overshadowed on social media with this ill-phrased comment. Throughout the night, Kaine brought up some of Trump's controversial statements on immigrants, and at the end of the debate the Virginia senator lobbed the attack again, quoting Matthew 12:34 (\"From the fullness of the heart the mouth speaks.\") as evidence Trump meant what he said about immigrants. \"Senator, you whipped out that Mexican thing again,\" Pence retorted. \"There are criminal aliens in this country, Tim, who have come into this country illegally who are perpetrating violence and taking American lives. He also said, 'And many of them are good people.' You keep leaving that out of your quote.\" Actually, Trump said in his announcement speech that Mexican immigrants are \"bringing drugs, they're bringing crime, they're rapists, and some, I assume, are good people.\" Foundation vs. Foundation Mike Pence and Tim Kaine had this exchange about the Clinton Foundation during tonight's #VPDebate https://t.co/Nt8qPGo7IY The charitable organization of each presidential candidate has been deeply probed this election cycle, and the vice presidential nominees defended their running mate's charities while attacking their opponent's. Pence attacked the Clinton Foundation for accepting money from foreign donors and governments, but Kaine defended it by saying it has high charity ratings and provides AIDS medication and works to curb the opioid epidemic. Tim Kaine and Mike Pence had this exchange about The Trump Organization and Trump Foundation during #VPDebate https://t.co/XNZr0CH5wk Kaine attacked Trump over his charitable foundation, which has been probed in the Washington Post over how it has spent its money \u2014 including on a $10,000 portrait of Trump. The Post also reported Trump's foundation had to pay an IRS penalty for donating to a political group linked to Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi (who at the time was deciding whether to pursue fraud allegations against Trump University). To Russia, With Love? Here's what Mike Pence said about whether Vladimir Putin would respect a Trump White House during #VPDebate https://t.co/sQ4Py61TzK Trump's frequent, controversial praise of Russian President Vladimir Putin was also a central flashpoint throughout Tuesday's debate. Pence denied that Trump has praised him (even though he has repeatedly) and even described him as the \"small and bullying leader of Russia.\" But he did say that Putin would respect a Trump administration because of \"strength, plain and simple.\" Kaine interrupted trying to probe Trump's possible business ties to Russia. \"Americans need to worry about whether Donald Trump will be watching out for America's bottom line or his own bottom line,\" the Democrat said. The 'Insult-Driven Campaign' Watch: Pence attacks Clinton/Kaine for Clinton calling Trump supporters a \"basket of deplorables\" #VPDebate https://t.co/iR7pClKCon Pence was also incredulous when Kaine charged that Trump was running an \"insult-driven campaign\" and shot back with Clinton's comments calling Trump's supporters a \"basket of deplorables.\" Of course, during the debate Trump was tweeting the debate \u2014 and re-tweeting some of his supporters who were insulting Kaine. \"@Jnelson52722: @realDonaldTrump @Susiesentinel Kaine looks like an evil crook out of the Batman movies\" The VP Candidates' Faith Tim Kaine and Mike Pence discuss times when they struggled to balance their faiths and a policy decision #VPDebate https://t.co/5K3RlxBObq One of the more somber moments of the debate came when Kaine and Pence were asked about their faith and if it ever conflicted with their public policy responsibilities. Kaine talked about how he had to enforce the death penalty even though he is personally against it, as is the Catholic Church, to which he belongs. Pence, an evangelical Protestant, used the time to talk about his opposition to abortion and belief in the \"sanctity of life.\" Trump has a mixed record on abortion, and Pence's comments could influence the evangelical base which may be skeptical of the GOP nominee's commitment to anti-abortion causes.",

Many expected the 90-minute face-off at Longwood University in Farmville, Va., to be a cordial affair, and it largely was, but each came armed with plenty of barbs to throw at the other. Ultimately, the debate was as much about Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton as it was about the men vying for the No. 2 job. Throughout the evening, each had to defend his running mate's controversies \u2014 Clinton's email server and the Clinton Foundation and Trump's controversial rhetoric and refusal to release his tax returns. Pence repeatedly denied many things that his running mate had, in fact, previously said. But overall the Indiana governor \u2014 who, as a former radio talk show host is practiced in verbal sparring \u2014 gave a much stronger performance than Trump did just over a week ago. It also likely helped his own political prospects, win or lose come Nov. 8. The two debaters often talked over each other, and Kaine frequently tried to interrupt Pence. Both veered off topic several times, even as moderator Elaine Quijano of CBS News tried to direct them back. The affable vice presidential candidates weren't expected to be traditional attack dogs, but there were plenty of flashes of aggression from both, though nothing compared to Clinton and Trump during their first debate. Ultimately, elections are about the top of the ticket, and attention will soon shift to Sunday's second debate in St. Louis. We recapped some of the key moments of the debate below.

R: Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine speaks at a campaign event Aug. 1 in Richmond, Va. The vice presidential nominees, Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine and Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, will meet on the debate stage Tuesday. It'll be two traditional politicians facing off in a non-traditional election year: Kaine as the safe and even boring choice by Hillary Clinton and Pence as the calm, unflappable balance to Donald Trump's bombast. When it comes to the issues, Kaine and Clinton mostly agree. Among other things, they want to raise taxes on the wealthy, expand gun control legislation, and they both support President Obama's executive orders on immigration. Pence and Trump, while wildly different in campaign style, agree that immigrants who enter the country illegally should not be granted amnesty, that abortions should be restricted, and that cutting taxes is the way to a healthier economy. But on Tuesday night, some of the differences the VP picks have with their running mates may find their way into the spotlight. Here are some issues where the two vice presidential nominees diverge from Clinton and Trump. The Authorization for Use of Military Force Clinton is sometimes referred to as hawkish. One example was her 2002 vote as a senator from New York in support of the Iraq War. Clinton has since said she \"got it wrong.\" Another example, again from the period following the 9/11 terrorist attacks, is the Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF), which went into effect in 2001. That military action gave the president the power to use force against groups that were involved in or aided the 9/11 attacks. It specifically mentions Al Qaeda and the Taliban, and also \"associated forces.\" The Bush and Obama administrations have interpreted \"associated forces\" broadly. So far, AUMF has been used to justify action 37 times, including against ISIS. Kaine believes the administration needs to seek re-authorization to continue its efforts against ISIS. Clinton said in a November CBS debate that she believes AUMF does cover ISIS. Abortion As a traditional Catholic, Kaine says he personally opposes abortion. But he has also said he doesn't believe a woman's choice to have an abortion should be dictated by the state. \"The last thing we need is government intruding into those personal decisions,\" Kaine said on Meet The Press in June. But as NPR reported, Kaine does support the Hyde Amendment, which banned federal funds from being used to cover abortions except in the case of rape, incest, or endangerment to the mother's life. Clinton, a longtime advocate for a woman's right to have an abortion, wants to repeal that amendment. When asked about the policy split on CNN, Kaine said, \"I can have my personal views, but I'm going to support the president of the United States.\" Both politicians, however, have spoken out in support of Planned Parenthood. After he voted against defunding the organization in 2015, Kaine said that for many women, \"Planned Parenthood health centers are their only source of high quality health care.\" Trade Trade means jobs, but trade also means security. The time has come for all of us to urge the swift adoption of the Trans Pacific Partnership In September, 2014, Pence used Twitter to advocate for the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), the free trade agreement between the U.S. and 11 other Pacific Rim countries. Pence tweeted that \"trade means jobs, but trade also means But Trump has made opposition to the TPP a prominent theme of his candidacy. The Republican nominee called the trade deal \"a death blow to American manufacturing\" in a June speech focused on the economy. \"Not only will the TPP undermine our economy,\" Trump said, \"but it will undermine our independence. That's what's happened. The TPP creates a new international commission that makes decisions the American people are no longer given the right to veto.\" LGBT Rights In 2015, Pence signed a controversial \"religious freedom\" bill in Indiana. Critics said the law allowed businesses to refuse service to LGBT people and the backlash was strong. Pence eventually signed an amended version into law. Trump has appeared more amenable to LGBT rights. In an NBC interview, the GOP nominee said he was against North Carolina's ban on transgender people using public bathrooms that don't correspond to the sex listed on their birth certificates. Although Trump has said he opposes gay marriage, this year's Republican National Convention marked the first time an openly gay speaker was given a prime-time slot to address the gathering. Also at the RNC, Trump directly referenced the LGBT community. \"As your president, I will do everything in my power to protect our LGBT citizens from the violence and oppression of a hateful foreign ideology,\" he said in his acceptance speech. Pence, on the other hand, has said gay marriage could bring about \"societal collapse.\" Planned Parenthood Trump has expressed support for Planned Parenthood as a healthcare provider, but has made his opposition to their abortion services clear. \"Planned Parenthood has done very good work... for millions of women,\" Trump said in March. \"I'm a conservative, but I'm a common-sense conservative.\" Throughout the campaign, however, he has aligned himself with many Congressional Republicans who want to close off any sources of federal funding to the group as long as it provides abortion services. As a member of the U.S. House, Pence sponsored the first bill to defund the women's health organization in 2007 and kept up opposition through 2011. \"Let the abortion providers provide for themselves,\" Pence told Politico in 2011. \"I'd like to continue to be a persistent, respectful voice for the sanctity of life.\" This post has been updated to clarify Trump's stance on Planned Parenthood funding.",

            "article_content": "The Supreme Court could play as an issue in the presidential election after the unexpected death of Justice Antonin Scalia left the court short handed.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: It's been nearly eight months since Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia died unexpectedly. His death left the nation's high court short-handed and evenly divided on some of the most important legal issues of the day. So is the Supreme Court playing as an issue in the presidential election? For an answer we turn to NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg. NINA TOTENBERG, BYLINE: Scalia died on February 13, and within hours, Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell pledged that no Obama nominee would get a hearing or a vote for nearly a year. The people should have a voice in the selection, he said, and therefore this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president. A month later Obama nominated Merrick Garland, the most centrist of the often-mentioned potential Democratic nominees. For years Republicans had called Garland the kind of consensus candidate they could support, but McConnell was able to keep his senators in line. And since Republicans control the Senate agenda, that meant the Garland nomination remained in total limbo. An incensed Obama was incredulous in this NPR interview. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST) PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: There's nobody who would suggest that our founders anticipated that a new rule is read into the Supreme Court nomination process in which for an entire year we don't do that because there's an election going on. TOTENBERG: At first it looked as though the GOP stonewalling on the Garland nomination might be a powerful issue for the Democrats. The public agreed with the president by large margins - as much as 70 and 80 percent in some polls. And Democrats thought they could force the GOP to act or pay on Election Day. Democratic pollster Peter Hart thought it would be a linchpin issue not just in the presidential election but for Democrats seeking to retake control of the Senate. PETER HART: It was clearly going to be an issue because the American public expected the Senate to do its job. TOTENBERG: But somehow the issue as a Democratic weapon seemed to melt away. HART: I think the problem is that we didn't find the method to be able to keep it front and center. TOTENBERG: And now Peter Hart says it's too late. Indeed Hillary Clinton only occasionally mentions the Supreme Court in her campaign speeches, but Donald Trump mentions it all the time. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DONALD TRUMP: We are going to appoint justices of the United States Supreme Court. We're going to appoint great Supreme Court justices. You have no choice. You got to go for Trump - Supreme Court justices. Look; Supreme Court Justice Scalia - great - was supposed to live for a long time. He died. TOTENBERG: Public opinion polls show that most voters don't rank the Supreme Court high as an issue, though a committed minority of Republican and Democratic voters do. In fact slightly more of the Republican base cares passionately. Gary Bauer, president of the conservative Campaign for Working Families, explains that there's a connection between the Supreme Court issue and social conservative support for Trump. Trump, he notes, has gone further than George W. Bush in his support for conservative causes like opposition to abortion and protection for so-called religious liberty issues. GARY BAUER: George W. Bush repeated over and over again that he had no litmus test on judges. Donald Trump has said over and over again his judges will be pro-life. What's missing of course is that he's not an evangelical, and he doesn't regularly quote Bible verses the way George W. Bush could. But if I want to hear Bible verses quoted, I'm perfectly happy to go to church on Sunday. TOTENBERG: Trump has also released two long lists of potential Supreme Court nominees, lists widely praised by social conservatives. There's no guarantee of course that if elected he would nominate from those lists. There are, however, some relatively certain predictions about the court and this presidential election. If Hillary Clinton is elected, the Scalia vacancy will be filled either by Merrick Garland or someone younger and more liberal, and it will be the first time in a half century that a majority of the justices are Democratic appointees. If Donald Trump fills the current vacancy, the court will continue to be dominated by a narrow conservative majority. The story doesn't end there, though, because there could well be more vacancies. Two of the current justices are over 80. A third is in his late-70s. If any or all of these were to leave during a Clinton presidency, that would likely mean a liberal court legacy possibly for decades. And if Trump is elected, it would mean a dramatic conservative turn for a generation. Nina Totenberg, NPR News, Washington. Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump expanded his list of potential Supreme Court nominees Friday. The new list consists of 10 more possible nominees, including a U.S. senator who has refused to endorse Trump. Trump's additional list, coming just days before the first debate, suggests he wants to add diversity to his earlier all-white list of eight men and three women. The second list, like the first, consists of bedrock conservatives, many with records hostile to abortion rights, same-sex marriage and federal regulations. While the new list adds the name of just one more woman, it is more racially and ethnically diverse \u2014 one African-American state court judge, a Venezuelan-born federal judge and another federal judge of South Asian descent. The only non-judge on the list is Utah Sen. Mike Lee, a Ted Cruz supporter during the primaries who has refused to endorse Trump and continued that position Friday, even in the face of a change from Cruz. Reaction to the new list was predictable. Carrie Severino of the Judicial Crisis Network, praised the Trump lists as \"unprecedented\" steps that should \"please conservatives\" if Trump is elected and delivers on the type of nominee he is promising. The Network says it has spent millions of dollars on ads opposing President Obama's Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland. Nan Aron, of the liberal Alliance for Justice, said that the new list, like the first one, consists of \"ultraconservatives who espouse a backward view of the law. Adding some racial diversity, she said, \"doesn't change the fact that these individuals' track records suggest they would endanger the cherished rights and freedoms of Americans.\" Trump's list includes none of the conservative lawyers who practice regularly before the Supreme Court, nor does it include any of the highly regarded conservative judges who sit on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, the court that the late Justice Antonin Scalia served on, and on which Obama nominee Garland now serves as Chief Judge. In the past, the D.C. Circuit, as it is known, has been something of a farm team for the Supreme Court. The current chief justice, John Roberts, and Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Clarence Thomas, all served on the D.C. Circuit before being elevated to the Supreme Court. Except for Sen. Lee, Trump's list is drawn from other courts around the country, both state and federal. Friday's additional 10 include:",

Baraka, an evangelical Christian, recently wrote a column in Christianity Today entitled \"Why I Can't Vote For Either Trump Or Clinton.\" In that article, the son of a former Black Panther says that \"as an African-American, I'm marginalized by the lack of compassion on the Right. As a Christian, I'm ostracized by the secularism of the Left.\" Many people are and should be fearful about the next president of the United States, he writes. NPR's David Greene spoke with Sho Baraka about the message he's trying to convey through his music and as an African-American evangelical Christian. On defending the Tea Party as a successful movement and model that he'd love to copy Well no, I don't know if I'm gonna defend them as successful but I would they've been successful in communicating their desires and their needs, in a sense of creating a platform where people hear their desires and what they stand for. And I don't know if there's a unified voice in the urban Christian context where you can say that there's these groups of peoples who speak for us. And I do feel like the Tea Party has been successful in doing that. On his ultimate goal I think baby steps. One, just creating a coalition that is biblically based but also shares the compassion that Jesus displayed in the scriptures \u2014 an individual who cares for the poor, who's concerned for the outcast and marginalized, but at the same time doesn't compromise his divinity in order to show compassion. I think what we often are asked to do is make those things mutually exclusive. On if he's going to vote in November I am going to vote. I'm especially going to vote in my state and local elections. I will definitely cast a ballot for someone in the presidential election; it will not be Trump or Clinton. On if he's worried that by not voting for a candidate that's not Republican or Democrat that he's not really taking part in the election I understand the argument \u2014 and I think it's a viable argument \u2014 but I also believe the \"protest vote\" as they will say ... it should speak volumes. So like if Donald Trump wins then the Democratic party should recognize, \"well, there's a base of individuals that we could have actually listened to, and rather pandered to.\" And on the left, if Hillary Clinton wins, I think there needs to be a lot of work done on the right to say, \"hey, how do we actually\" \u2014 you know, you hear a lot of Donald Trump in his platitudes of \"I'll help the black community out\" \u2014 \"but what actually will you do?\" And I don't think there's been any steps to actually have real legitimate conversations or interactions with people. And so for both parties, I think there needs to be a reassessment on how we are to earn the vote of the urban Christian. On if he has any songs that speak to this type of tension \"Maybe Both\" \u2014 it's loosely based off Malcolm X's \"Ballot In A Bullet\" speech, where he talks about the importance of the vote, and to hold your vote and use it like a bullet. You don't waste bullets in war. And I think what we've done \u2014 not just as an urban Christian demographic, but as a black community \u2014 I think we've just given up our allegiance, our blind allegiance, to the Democratic Party, without them actually giving any true concern to the plight of African-Americans in this country. ... Malcolm X would have said, that was political \u2014 he called those individuals political chumps. And so this song basically talks about a critique of both parties. And then on the third verse, I draw a greater conclusion on how oftentimes we use Jesus as a construct to propel or promote our own personal agendas, but understanding he was much more complex than we often like to make him out to be.",

Tim Kaine, make their first public appearance as a joint ticket in Florida on July 23. Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine clarified Sunday that his position on abortion rights is unmoved, despite top Clinton campaign aides' recent assertions otherwise. \"My voting position on abortion hasn't really changed,\" Kaine told CNN. \"I support the Hyde Amendment. I haven't changed that.\" Kaine, a Catholic, is personally opposed to abortion but has said he would not legislate otherwise, and he has a perfect scorecard from the political arm of Planned Parenthood. Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., in a May 1981 file photo.\n                \n                    \n                    Anonymous/ASSOCIATED PRESS\n                    \n                \nhide caption Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., in a May 1981 file photo. The Hyde Amendment, named after former Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., is a 40-year-old policy that blocks Medicaid health care plans from covering abortions, except in cases of rape, incest or if the mother's life is endangered. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton wants to repeal the Hyde Amendment, as do many Democrats in Congress. A week earlier, Clinton campaign manger Robby Mook told CNN that there was no daylight between the running mates on the issue. \"(Kaine) has said that he will stand with Secretary Clinton to defend a woman's right to choose, to repeal the Hyde amendment,\" Mook said, \"Voters can be 100 percent confident that Tim Kaine is going to fight to protect a woman's right to choose.\" Several media outlets \u2014 citing Clinton and Kaine aides \u2014 reported Kaine privately told Clinton he supports her position on the Hyde Amendment. Kaine personally shot that down on Sunday. In his CNN interview, Kaine said he mulled his personal differences with Clinton on abortion but decided ultimately: \"I can have my personal views, but I'm going to support the president of the United States, and I will.\" The Hyde Amendment is routinely, and generally without incident, added to annual spending bills and has, for most of its existence, been characterized as a compromise position in the divisive abortion debate. However, with increasingly fewer congressional Democrats who oppose abortion rights, the Democratic Party has embraced a more progressive view on the issue. The 2016 party platform \u2014 which calls for repealing the Hyde Amendment \u2014 and Clinton's candidacy represent the most progressive party positions on abortion rights in American history. NARAL President Ilyse Hogue issued a statement calling Kaine's position \"deeply disappointing\" but highlighted his statement to support Clinton's stance. Kaine's abortion views were often cited by liberal Democratic activists as a reason against his selection for vice president. Clinton, clearly, did not share those concerns. The vice president is unlikely to play any role in shaping abortion policy, and a theoretical President Clinton is not going to sign legislation to rescind abortion rights. Democrats would need to sweep control of both chambers of Congress and would likely need a super-majority in the Senate to overturn the Hyde Amendment. Even now, Democratic senators like Bob Casey of Pennsylvania and Joe Manchin of West Virginia have voiced opposition to efforts to challenge the Hyde Amendment and would likely resist those efforts in the Senate. In other words, the outcome of the 2016 election is unlikely to bring a change to the long-standing policy. But the Democratic Party, Tim Kaine aside, is shifting ever closer to consensus that it should.",

            "article_content": "Hillary Clinton has tapped Virginia SenatorTim Kaine to be her running mate, completing the democratic presidential ticket.  SCOTT SIMON, HOST: This is WEEKEND EDITION from NPR News. I'm Scott Simon. Hillary Clinton has chosen Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia to be her vice presidential running mate. Senator Kaine is a moderate from a political swing state who's made the shortlist before. NPR's Ailsa Chang has this profile. AILSA CHANG, BYLINE: Up until now, the biggest knock against Tim Kaine as a VP pick was that he's just kind of, well, boring. A few weeks ago, NBC's Chuck Todd read out loud to Kaine exactly what people in politics think of him. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"MEET THE PRESS\") CHUCK TODD: He's not anybody's idea of exploding volcano of charisma. TIM KAINE: (Laughter). TODD: Are these critics or compliments to you? KAINE: I mean, they're true. I am boring, but, you know, boring is the fastest growing demographic in this country. CHANG: At least, that's what Hillary Clinton is hoping - that there will be something for everyone to like about self-deprecating, affable Tim Kaine. He is a moderate in a swing state who has never lost an election. He also brings executive experience as a former mayor of Richmond and governor of Virginia. (SOUNDBITE OF NEWS BROADCAST) UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: At least 30 people believed to be killed on the campus of Virginia Tech University. CHANG: It was as governor that Kaine first found himself in the national spotlight. After the massacre at Virginia Tech in 2007, he scrambled home early from a trip to Asia to help his state heal. The devout Catholic leaned on his faith for the right words. (SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE) KAINE: Losing a son, losing a daughter, a brother, a sister, losing a close friend - it can go beyond grief to isolation and feeling despair. Those haunting words that were uttered on a hill, on Calvary - my God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? Despair is a natural emotion. CHANG: Faith has been a driving force for Kaine, the son of a welder who owned an iron working shop in Kansas City. He took time off from Harvard Law School to be a missionary in Honduras, where he came face-to-face with the starkest poverty. It was also where Kaine learned Spanish. (SOUNDBITE OF SENATE HEARING) KAINE: (Speaking Spanish). CHANG: Three years ago, Kaine became the first senator to deliver a floor speech in Spanish when he spoke for 14 minutes about the need to pass comprehensive immigration reform. Progressives will agree he has the right views on immigration, but many say he's too middle of the road when it comes to trade and financial regulations. He is a man who understands how to thread the needle. His religion makes him personally opposed to abortion, but he will say this. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KAINE: Matters about reproduction and intimacy and relationships and contraception are in the personal realm. They're moral decisions for individuals to make for themselves. CHANG: Oh, and one more thing. (SOUNDBITE OF HARMONICA MUSIC) UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Tim Kaine on harmonica. (APPLAUSE) CHANG: He plays the harmonica. So how boring could he be? (SOUNDBITE OF HARMONICA MUSIC) CHANG: Kaine is known to jam with musicians, like here in Hiltons, Va., where he was wearing a hip denim jacket on top of khakis. Ailsa Chang, NPR News, Washington.

Tim Kaine, D-Va., campaigned last week in Northern Virginia with Hillary Clinton before she chose him as her vice presidential running mate. While many pundits and political observers were quick to praise Hillary Clinton's pick of Tim Kaine as her running mate on Friday, the choice wasn't met with universal acclaim. One important group \u2014 progressives and backers of Clinton's former rival, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders \u2014 were not as pleased with the selection of the Virginia senator who has cultivated a reputation of working across the aisle over the course of his political career. Progressive Change Campaign Committee co-founder Stephanie Taylor said in a statement that with some of Kaine's pro-free trade positions, \"Republicans now have a new opening to attack Democrats on this economic populist issue\" that Republican nominee Donald Trump has also been vocally opposed to. That's a weakness Clinton's campaign seemed to recognize, and a Clinton campaign aide told NPR's Tamara Keith that the senator had reconsidered his position on supporting fast-tracking for the Trans-Pacific Partnership deal and couldn't support it in its current form. But even before Kaine was announced on Friday, other groups remained skeptical of his appeal. Democracy for America executive director Charles Chamberlain called Kaine's support for bank deregulation \"disqualifying.\" Many such groups would have preferred more progressive champions such as Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren or Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown. Both were reportedly on Clinton's short list, but their home-state GOP governors would have appointed a Republican to replace them if Clinton wins, further tipping a Senate chamber Democrats are trying to flip. Here are four reasons why progressive groups are unhappy with Kaine as the new vice presidential nominee. 1. He's too nice In an election year where the Democratic base fell in love with the pugnacious styles of Sanders and Warren, Kaine's low-key, nice-guy persona feels like a bit of a letdown. Clinton is picking a Democrat whom Republicans like, which in this polarized climate feels like a betrayal. He's the type of lawmaker who seeks to build bipartisan consensus, not the kind who holds the line on the liberal position. Arizona Republican Sen. Jeff Flake \u2014 who has refused to endorse Trump \u2014 even had good words to say about Kaine after the news broke. Trying to count the ways I hate @timkaine. Drawing a blank. Congrats to a good man and a good friend. 2. He's too white A Southern, white Democrat is not exactly the future of the party. Not picking a woman or a minority also feels like a disappointment among base voters. Especially if they feel like women (Warren) and Latinos (Labor Secretary Tom Perez) were passed over for the white guy. 3. He's too moderate Except, Kaine isn't really. He has a zero percent rating from the American Conservative Union. But his bipartisan style often lends itself to a perception that he's a moderate. On some issues, he definitely strikes a more centrist tone. Kaine is big on the military, partly because that's a huge issue in Virgina, home to many military bases and defense contractors. And he's also seen as a business-friendly Democrat, which is true because he was a governor and most governors have more business-friendly views on how to govern. Kaine has supported some tweaks to Dodd-Frank Wall Street reforms that liberals see as a betrayal. He's also a devout Catholic who is personally opposed to the death penalty and abortion, but he has a 100 percent rating from Planned Parenthood. 4. He's too \"safe\" Some (including Kaine himself) say he is boring. He won't overshadow the top of the ticket but will be an effective on-message surrogate. Clinton has admitted she isn't a strong retail politician, while Kaine has managed to win statewide in Virginia twice. He hasn't been tested yet on a national stage and may not be the firebrand attraction some had hoped for. But he could help her attract disaffected Republicans and independents turned off by Trump.",

When it comes to the issues, Kaine and Clinton agree on a lot, although some on the left have criticized Clinton's pick as not progressive enough and too similar to her on too many fronts. Here's where Kaine and Clinton stand on some key issues: The Trans-Pacific Partnership, a free-trade agreement between the U.S. and 11 other nations, has gotten a lot of attention on the campaign trail since the countries involved reached a consensus in October and signed the agreement in February. People who support the deal say it will stimulate the economies of the participating countries. Critics say it will move U.S. jobs overseas. In an October PBS NewsHour interview, Clinton said she opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership. \"I have said from the very beginning that we had to have a trade agreement that would create good American jobs, raise wages and advance our national security and I still believe that's the high bar we have to meet,\" Clinton said in October. \"I don't believe [the Trans-Pacific Partnership] is going to meet the high bar I have set.\" Kaine supported the agreement and voted in favor of giving President Obama fast-track authority to negotiate the agreement. He has recently changed his stance and now echoes Clinton's sentiment, saying he can't support TPP in its current form. Clinton and Kaine agree on both abortion rights and on supporting Planned Parenthood but Clinton has been a more outspoken, calling restrictions to Planned Parenthood \"a concerted, persistent assault on women's health across our country\" in a June Planned Parenthood Action Fund speech. Hillary stands up for Planned Parenthood\u2014and women's rights. pic.twitter.com/eZ5LRJyasg In a March Fox News town hall debate, Clinton defended her pro-choice stance on abortions: \"Under Roe v. Wade, which is rooted in the Constitution, women have this right to make this highly personal decision with their family, in accordance with their faith, with their doctor,\" Clinton said. \"It's not much of a right if it is totally limited and constrained.\" Kaine has called himself a \"traditional Catholic,\" and has says he opposes abortion personally. However, the senator said in a June Meet The Press interview that he doesn't let his personal beliefs affect his position on the issue. He said he believes the decision of whether or not to have an abortion shouldn't be dictated by the government: \"I deeply believe, and not just as a matter of politics, but even as a matter of morality, that matters about reproduction and intimacy and relationships and contraception are in the personal realm. They're moral decisions for individuals to make for themselves. And the last thing we need is government intruding into those personal decisions.\" Both politicians have spoken out in support of Planned Parenthood. In a statement after he voted against defunding the women's health organization in August 2015, Kaine said that for many women, \"Planned Parenthood health centers are their only source of high quality health care.\" Planned Parenthood provides many critical, preventative services. Here\u2019s just some #StandWithPP pic.twitter.com/TmPRd7GJ1X In Clinton's June speech for the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, she called for an increase in federal funding to the organization and thanked them for \"being there for women no matter their race, sexual orientation or immigration status.\" In this election cycle, Hillary Clinton has vehemently called for heightened gun control. She has promised to expand background checks, close any loopholes to purchasing guns such as those stemming from gun shows or internet sales, and restrict access to assault-style weapons. She has said she would stand up to the National Rifle Association as president. I refuse to accept this as normal. We must take action to stop gun violence now. -H https://t.co/SkKglwQycb Clinton hasn't always been so outspoken on the issue. When she ran against then-Senator Obama in the 2008 Democratic primaries, she tried to appeal to supporters of gun rights by \"fondly recalling that she had learned to shoot as a child,\" according to the Chicago Tribune. But she has been a longtime gun control advocate, supporting the 1993 Brady Bill which mandated federal background checks and waiting periods on gun sales. She also supported gun control measures during her 2000 Senate run. Kaine has also been strong on gun control. That may be due to his familiarity with the issue: Kaine \u2014 and his views on gun control \u2014 were thrust into the spotlight while we was Virginia's governor in 2007. That year, a shooter killed 32 people at Virginia Tech before killing himself, making it one of the deadliest mass shootings in U.S. history. Kaine was in Japan at the time and flew back early to travel to the university. Last Month, when Democrats held the Senate floor for 15 hours to spur action on gun control legislation, he spoke of his experience in the aftermath of the shooting: \"That was the worst day of my life, and it will always be the worst day of my life \u2014 comforting the families of the victims, talking to the first responders who went into a classroom where bodies littered the floor and who heard in the pockets of deceased students and professors cell phones ringing as parents who had seen it on the news were calling their kids, just knowing they were at Virginia Tech to ask them if they were all right \u2014 calls that would never be answered.\" During that speech, Kaine defended the Second Amendment. He has said he is a gun owner himself, but according to a statement on his website, he supports \"common sense legislation\" to expand background checks, restrict assault-style weapons and expand mental health services. Clinton is famously thought of as \"hawkish.\" She pushed for military intervention in Libya and backed President George W. Bush's decision to invade Iraq in 2003. During a November debate on CBS, when asked whether she would declare war on ISIS, Clinton said the U.S. already has \"an authorization to use military force against terrorists. We passed it after 9/11.\" When asked if that covers ISIS, she added, \"It certainly does cover it.\" That's not quite right: as NPR has reported, the original law authorizing military force was signed in 2001 and gave the president the power to use force against groups which aided the September 11 attacks, not simply terrorists. And that's where Clinton and Kaine seem to disagree. Kaine says the president is not already authorized to use force, saying ISIS does not fall under the original authorization. He has pushed the Obama administration to get re-authorization from Congress in its fight against the terrorist group. A new authorization has not been reissued to include ISIS and Kaine has argued that until that happens, Obama's ISIS campaign is unconstitutional. In September 2014, Kaine, who has a son in the Marines, called on Obama to seek authorization on the Senate floor: \"During a time of war, we ask our troops to give their best even to the point of sacrificing their own lives. When compared against that, how much of a sacrifice is it for a President to engage in a possibly contentious debate with Congress about whether military action is a good idea? How much of a sacrifice is it for a member of Congress to debate and vote about whether military action is a good idea? While Congressional members face the political costs of debate on military action, our service members bear the human costs of those decisions. And if we choose to avoid debate, avoid accountability, avoid a hard decision how can we demand that our military willingly sacrifice their very lives?\" Education is another area in which Clinton and Kaine used to disagree and are now aligned. When Clinton was a New York senator, she helped draft the No Child Left Behind act, which aimed at upping student achievement. She voted in favor of the act in 2001. By 2008, though, Clinton was critical of NCLB and has said she supports its replacement, the 2015 Every Student Succeeds Act, which she said has a \"better balance on testing.\" Kaine was critical of NCLB earlier on. In response to President Bush's 2006 State Of The Union address, Kaine, a governor at the time, said the education act was \"wreaking havoc on local school districts.\" He has criticized the bill for having unintended consequences, like its focus on high-stakes testing. The new act includes provisions written by Kaine that focused on promoting career and technical education.",

            "article_content": "The United States would \"absolutely\" defend its NATO allies, Republican vice presidential nominee Mike Pence told the PBS NewsHour on Thursday, appearing to contradict a statement from Donald Trump a day earlier about how he would treat the obligations of the decades-old military alliance. \"We'll uphold our treaty obligations, including the mutual defense agreement that is NATO,\" Pence said. Trump told the New York Times on Wednesday that \"if we cannot be properly reimbursed for the tremendous cost of our military protecting other countries [then] yes, I would be absolutely prepared to tell those countries, 'Congratulations, you will be defending yourself.' \" But in an interview with PBS NewsHour's Judy Woodruff, Pence, the governor of Indiana and Trump's newly selected running mate, seemed to interpret Trump's comments differently. If Trump was elected president, Pence said, \"he would absolutely stand by our allies and treaty obligations.\" Pence's NATO comments came during a broad-ranging interview in which he touched on abortion, the future of the Supreme Court, and trade. They hear in Donald Trump someone who says, we can do better. Republican vice presidential nominee Mike Pence \"People are tired of being told that this is as good as it gets,\" Pence said in an interview at the Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland, one day after accepting his party's vice presidential nomination. \"They hear in Donald Trump someone who says, we can do better.\" Pence, a former congressman and television and radio show host who is staunchly anti-abortion, also touched on abortion, saying he has had several \"heart to heart\" conversations with Trump on the issue and feels comfortable with the real estate mogul's position. \"I'm grateful to Donald Trump's pro-life views, and I'm grateful that he's expressed those views so publicly and openly,\" Pence said. Pence also said he felt confident Trump would appoint conservative justices to the Supreme Court, something Trump's Republican opponents questioned in the primaries. The court currently has one vacant seat, owing to the death earlier this year of Justice Antonin Scalia, and could have one or more openings during the next presidency. The interview with Pence came just hours before Trump's acceptance speech, in which he is expected to focus on national security, terrorism and trade, among other issues. \"We had a field of outstanding candidates, and primaries get a little bit rough,\" Pence said. \"It takes some time for people to get beyond those things.\" Trump's speech will cap a four-day convention that has seen its share of staging and technical issues. On Monday night, Melania Trump's speech stirred controversy after it was discovered that a section echoed Michelle Obama's speech at the Democratic National Convention in 2008. On Wednesday night, a temporary power outage shut down the large video scoreboards behind the speaker's podium, forcing Trump's son Eric to deliver his prime-time address in front of a black backdrop. Perhaps most significantly, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas received a strong rebuke from delegates on the floor after he gave a speech on Wednesday night in which he did not endorse Trump. As Cruz, who finished second in the primaries, neared the end of his remarks, delegates began booing and continued until he left the stage. The incident underscored the deep divisions that still remain in the party after a bruising primary battle in which Trump beat out several of the GOP's biggest names, including former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who was a runner-up for vice president. In the interview with PBS NewsHour, Pence called Cruz a \"friend\" and downplayed the incident, arguing that conservative voters would coalesce around Trump ahead of the election in November.

            "article_content": "The Republican Party has a black voter problem. African-Americans attending the GOP Convention in Cleveland are hoping Donald Trump can attract more of them.  ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: The Republican Party has a black voter problem, and Donald Trump really has a black voter problem. But here in Cleveland at the Republican National Convention, some people are trying to change that. NPR's Sam Sanders has that story. SAM SANDERS, BYLINE: The latest bad number on Trump and black voters - zero. That's how much black support Trump got in one recent poll. I asked a lot of black Republicans here in Cleveland this week just what they make of a number that bad. SIMONE PERRY: I think that just proves how invalid polls, for the most part, are. HENRY CHILDS SR.: Polling can be anecdotal data if it's not done correctly. OMAROSA MANIGAULT: What poll was that? I keep hearing people throw that around. Could you tell me the name of it? SANDERS: That was Simone Perry and alternate delegate Henry Childs Sr., both from Georgia. And that last voice you heard was Omarosa Manigault's. She's Trump's recently appointed director of African-American outreach and former star of \"The Apprentice.\" To answer her question, that last one, the poll came from NBC and The Wall Street Journal. It measured black support in Pennsylvania and Ohio. To change that number, the party might need to rethink its messaging on perhaps the most important issue for lots of black voters this election - policing. Talk off mic with black Republicans, and they say problems with police in black communities must be addressed. Omarosa, Trump's head of black outreach - she said it's an issue dear to her heart, but at the podium, you hear a different thing from black speakers. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DAVID CLARKE: What we witnessed in Ferguson and Baltimore and Baton Rouge was a collapse of the social order. SANDERS: That's David Clarke, the sheriff of Milwaukee County. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CLARKE: So many of the actions of the Occupy movement and Black Lives Matter transcends peaceful protests and violates the code of conduct we rely on. I call it anarchy. SANDERS: That same night Darryl Glenn, a Senate candidate from Colorado, said this. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DARRYL GLENN: You know, and quite frankly, somebody with a nice tan needs to say this. All lives matter. SANDERS: This is not the kind of outreach Henry Childs wants. He's a black delegate from Texas, and he says Republicans probably won't do better with black voters by continuing a kind of colorblind outreach. CHILDS SR.: They see black engagement as pandering. It's not pandering. It's called communicating. We have no trouble reaching out to other groups - Second Amendment groups, pro-life groups, women groups. But when it comes to black groups, for some reason, it seems like it's like playing racial politics. It's not. SANDERS: Donald Trump has not suggested a ban on all blacks or a wall keeping them out. Even so, Childs says he doesn't expect the work of outreach to black voters to come from Trump. It's going to come from black Republicans like him. Does Donald Trump make the job of black Republicans doing that outreach harder or easier? CHILDS SR.: I'm going to do my job regardless. My job is hard enough by itself. I'm a black Republican. So the Republican Party doesn't value what I do, and the Democrats hate what I do. So I'm getting it from both ends. SANDERS: Childs is one of a very small number of black delegates on the floor in Cleveland this week. But he said he's going to keep doing what he's doing because black voters deserve a choice.

            "article_content": "Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump introduces his newly selected running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, in New York City on Saturday.\n                \n                    \n                    Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump introduces his newly selected running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, in New York City on Saturday. In choosing Indiana Gov. Mike Pence as his running mate, Donald Trump has reassured both establishment republicans and social conservatives \u2014 but he has also picked someone who in many ways is his polar opposite. Pence addresses the Republican National Convention on Wednesday night. As a conservative talk show host in Indiana, Pence called himself \"Rush Limbaugh on decaf.\" The show followed two failed runs for Congress that landed Pence flat on his face. His second run in 1992 was even more disastrous than the first. He was soundly defeated after election records showed he used campaign funds to pay his mortgage, golf fees and other personal expenses. The payments were not illegal at the time but would become so under rules changes that followed the disclosure. And he used such nasty attack ads against his opponent, Democrat Philip Sharp, that they \"backfired,\" according to Sharp, giving the Democratic incumbent a much larger victory over his GOP opponent than in Pence's first run. Pence talks with fellow Republicans during the first session of the 112th Congress in 2011.\n                \n                    \n                    Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Pence later renounced his attack ads as \"wrong\" and swore off negative campaigning. In 2000, he was finally elected to the U.S. House, where he served for 12 years, rising to the No. 3 Republican leadership position. And in 2012, he was elected governor of Indiana, succeeding the enormously popular Republican Gov. Mitch Daniels, known for balancing budgets and building a business-friendly environment. Pence remained popular for his first couple of years as governor, but that would not last, according to Christine Matthews, a Republican pollster and president of Bellwether Research Group. \"Mike Pence is a polarizing figure in Indiana\" now, she says. At the beginning of his tenure, she observes, Pence, like Daniels, avoided social issues and focused on economic development, tax cuts and jobs. But that all changed when he moved to emphasize a conservative social agenda\u2014 a failed attempt to ban gay marriage; an abortion law that it makes it illegal for a woman to have an abortion because of a fetal abnormality; and perhaps more important, he signed into law a provision that allowed businesses with religious objections to refuse services to LGBT customers. Pence leaves a press conference at the Indiana State Library in Indianapolis in 2015, where he spoke about the state's controversial Religious Freedom Restoration Act.\n                \n                    \n                    Aaron P. Bernstein/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption The state Religious Freedom Restoration Act, as it is known, \"turned off suburban and college-educated voters,\" says pollster Matthews, and sent the state's business leaders \"through the roof.\" Among those business executives was Angie's List co-founder Bill Oesterle, a longtime Republican activist, who threatened to abandon a major expansion of his company in the state. Pence \"was clearly pandering to some extreme players in the party here in Indiana,\" Oesterle says, \"and that was a sign to all of us that he was deviating from what he had told us he was going to do.\" In the end, the economic pressure pushed the Indiana governor to \"cave,\" Oesterle observes. Pence, after pledging not to change the law, signed a so-called \"fix,\" a compromise to soften the legislation. But the whole episode, topped off by his support for the abortion measure, which was denounced by a significant number of pro-life female Republican state legislators, had its effect. Until he was chosen for the No. 2 spot on the national ticket, polls showed Pence only an even bet for re-election. Still, the 57-year-old Pence is, in many ways, the do-no-harm choice as Trump's running mate. He may not expand Trump's appeal outside the GOP base, but establishment Republicans are comfortable with him, and social conservatives seem to have forgiven him for the \"fix.\" \"Nobody gets 100 percent, so he's batting ... maybe 85,\" says Curt Smith, president of the Indiana Family Institute and a delegate to the Republican National Convention. \"That's a solid B-plus.\" Smith, who once was furious at Pence for abandoning social conservatives on \"the fix,\" now predicts that Pence will be a great \"partner\" for Trump and not a \"sycophant.\" While Pence may seem boring next to Trump, he has important qualities that Trump does not have. Pence and his wife, Karen, leave a meeting with Trump in New York on Friday.\n                \n                    \n                    Evan Vucci/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Pence and his wife, Karen, leave a meeting with Trump in New York on Friday. \"He balances Mr. Trump out in terms of personalities,\" says political science professor Andrew Downs, director of the Center for Indiana Politics at Indiana University-Purdue University in Fort Wayne. \"He is Midwestern polite. He's also very good at staying on message.\" Relentlessly good at staying on message. To cite one example, when the state's controversial religious freedom law was enacted, Pence appeared on ABC's This Week. In the 12-minute interview, host George Stephanopoulos tried in vain 12 separate times to get an answer to various versions of this question: If a florist in Indiana refuses to provide flowers for a gay couple's wedding, is that legal under the state's new religious freedom law, yes or no? Pence's replies were a demonstration in the fine art of giving a long response that doesn't answer the question. Pence may have to use that talent for evasion in the coming campaign. He has taken many positions, some reflected by his votes in Congress, that are dramatically different from Donald Trump's. Pence has been a strong advocate of free trade, endorsing every trade agreement that's come before him, including the Trans-Pacific Partnership specifically opposed by Trump. He has strongly opposed Trump's proposal to ban all Muslims from immigrating to the United States \u2014 Pence declared that the U.S. Constitution specifically protects people of all faiths. He grudgingly embraced Obamacare, taking the federal government's money for Medicaid expansion, but attaching more conservative strings to it. And unlike Trump, he supported the Iraq War. The balancing act may prove tricky for this ticket, as illustrated when Lesley Stahl, interviewing Trump and Pence on 60 Minutes last Sunday, reminded Trump that his running mate had voted for the Iraq War. \"I don't care,\" Trump responded. \"What do you mean you don't care?\" Stahl asked. \"It's a long time ago, and he voted that way and they were also misled,\" Trump answered. Stahl then reminded Trump that he had harped on this very vote as evidence of Hillary Clinton's bad judgment. \"He's entitled to make a mistake every once in a while,\" Trump replied, nudging Pence. \"But she's not?\" Stahl followed up. \"No, she's not,\" Trump shot back. Through it all, Pence sat by, with a bemused smile on his face.",

Last month the high court struck down a Texas law that imposed tight regulations on abortion providers.\n                \n                    \n                    Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption An anti-abortion demonstrator outside the U.S. Supreme Court in Washington, D.C., in March. Last month the high court struck down a Texas law that imposed tight regulations on abortion providers. Delegates at the Republican convention in Cleveland have approved the strongest anti-abortion platform in the party's history. But groups that oppose abortion \u2014 groups that lobbied for the strong language \u2014 are far from unified. In fact, following last month's Supreme Court decision reaffirming a woman's right to abortion, leaders of a movement known for speaking largely with one voice are showing some surprising disagreement. For the past several years, anti-abortion groups have pushed an agenda aimed at imposing much stricter regulation on abortion facilities. The groups said it was to promote the health and safety of women; abortion-rights supporters said it was an effort to regulate the clinics out of existence. At least for now, the Supreme Court is siding with abortion-rights backers. Neither of the portions of Texas' omnibus abortion law that were up for review \"offers medical benefits sufficient to justify the burdens upon access that each imposes,\" wrote Justice Stephen Breyer in the court's majority opinion. The provisions that were struck down required abortion clinics in the state to meet the much higher safety standards for facilities that do much more advanced surgical procedures; the provisions also required doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of the clinic. In hindsight, \"maybe it was a mistake for us to champion safeguards for women,\" said Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the Susan B. Anthony List, whose goal is to elect more anti-abortion candidates to public office. \"Maybe we shouldn't have done that.\" At a media briefing last week, Dannenfelser said her group will instead rally around legislation that has passed in more than a dozen states to ban abortion at roughly 20 weeks of pregnancy. Similar legislation passed the U.S. House but not the Senate. The 20-week ban is \"our top priority,\" Dannenfelser said. But Clarke Forsythe, acting president and senior counsel for Americans United for Life, said his group plans no fundamental change in strategy. \"It is more important than ever to focus on the risks to women and negative consequences,\" he said in an interview. \"The justices can't sweep away the public health vacuum that they created with a few pen strokes.\" Forsythe said that while the high court's ruling has \"put some roadblocks in the way, and we will have to take those into consideration,\" there are still plenty of opportunities to regulate abortion providers that could pass constitutional muster, particularly if they are more narrowly targeted than the Texas law was. The nation's oldest anti-abortion group, the National Right to Life Committee, has never embraced the push for health and safety regulations aimed at women. \"Our focus has always been on the humanity of the unborn,\" said its president, Carol Tobias, rather than potential risks to women seeking abortions. Her group has instead been pushing state and federal bills to ban abortions after 20 weeks and also ban \"dilation and evacuation\" abortions, which are the most common procedure performed after the first trimester of pregnancy. \"I don't think the Texas decision is necessarily going to impact those types of legislation, and I know it's not going to affect us,\" she said. But there is one thing all these anti-abortion groups seem to agree on: The future makeup of the Supreme Court \u2014 and the future of abortion rights \u2014 hang in the balance with the upcoming election. Because of the vacancy left by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia last winter, \"it is so obvious, so simple to make the case\" about the importance of who controls the White House and Senate when it comes to Supreme Court appointments, said Dannenfelser. \"We say the court's always important,\" said Tobias. \"But this time we have solid proof.\" The groups also agree on something else \u2014 that despite the recent decision by the Supreme Court, abortion-rights forces are not winning the fight. \"The pro-life cause has never been stronger,\" said Dannenfelser. \"And our opponents' position has never been weaker.\" Immediately after the court's ruling, said Tobias, \"Planned Parenthood came out and said they were going to pass pro-abortion legislation and repeal pro-life legislation.\" That is true. \"Today's victory means we can fight state by state, legislature by legislature, law by law, and restore women's access to reproductive health care,\" Dawn Laguens, executive vice president of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, said in a written statement. But in fact, Tobias said, \"they haven't been able to do that in 40 years. The only way they make advances is through the courts. They don't have the people\" on their side. In an interview, Laguens agreed that her side has more work to do. \"We've got to change hearts and minds,\" she said. But Laguens insists it is abortion opponents who are \"out of sync with America and out of sync with the new generation.\" With a more \"social justice minded\" generation of millennials now coming of age, she said, foes of abortion are the ones on the defensive. \"They're in a last-gasp moment,\" she said. \"They feel it slipping away.\" Kaiser Health News is an editorially independent news service that is part of the nonpartisan Henry J.

            "article_content": "Presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump appeared today for the first time with his vice presidential running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence. Pence brings a popularity with the base that could help Trump.  MICHEL MARTIN, HOST: Governor Mike Pence is back in Indiana this evening. He returned to his state for a rally, his first as Donald Trump's running mate. The presumptive Republican nominee made his first public appearance with Pence today in Manhattan. It was one of the biggest moments of Trump's campaign and the culmination of a rocky rollout. NPR's Sarah McCammon has more from New York. SARAH MCCAMMON, BYLINE: This week, Donald Trump has seemed a bit like a jittery groom. He quickly put off his big announcement in the wake of the deadly attacks in Nice, France, prompting speculation that he was getting cold feet. But this morning, Trump made it official. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DONALD TRUMP: So I'm here today to introduce the man who will be my partner in this campaign and the White House to fix our rigged system. MCCAMMON: Trump stood alone behind the podium at a Hilton Hotel in Midtown Manhattan. He suggested he'd chosen Pence because of his reputation as a social conservative on issues like same-sex marriage and abortion. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: And one of the reasons is party unity, I have to be honest. So many people have said party unity. MCCAMMON: Nominating Pence, a governor with experience in Congress, could also help Trump with the party's establishment, who frequently urged him to watch his tone. But even in this speech, the real estate developer displayed his tendency to follow no script but his own, often drifting from his prepared remarks as he praised his running mate's economic record. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: Besides that, Bobby Knight, my friend who really did help me - I mean, if you want to reference Bobby Knight in Indiana, we love Bobby Knight. But he agrees with everything I'm saying. He loves the governor. MCCAMMON: Trump brought up a hotel his companies are developing in Washington, D.C., as an example of his ability to oversee projects. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: It's amazing, probably the best location, one of the most sought after projects in the history of the GSA, general services. MCCAMMON: Finally, about half an hour in, Trump came back around to the issue at hand. He forgave Pence's primary endorsement of Texas Senator Ted Cruz, dismissing it not as disloyalty, but a reluctant capitulation to the establishment. Trump called it the single greatest non-endorsement I've ever had. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: With that, I would like to introduce a man who I truly believe will be outstanding in every way and will be the next vice president of the United States, Governor Mike Pence. (APPLAUSE) TRUMP: Thank you. Thank you everybody. Thank you. MCCAMMON: Pence, for his part, was careful not to outshine the presumptive nominee. He gave a disciplined speech talking about spending time with the Trump family and vouching for Trump's character. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MIKE PENCE: Donald Trump is a good man, and he will make a great president of the United States of America. MCCAMMON: Trump has been seen as friendlier with others on his VP short list, like former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie. His campaign has denied news reports that Trump was up late into the night Thursday asking aides if there was time to change his mind. Trump and Pence may not be soul mates, but they could form a marriage of convenience. Pence brings a calmer temperament and popularity with the base that Trump may need in a tough election fight. Using language from the Bible, Pence suggested Trump had made up his mind days ago, and he said, yes. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PENCE: And when I got this call last Wednesday, I could only think of that ancient question - who am I, oh Lord? And who is my family that you have brought us this far? MCCAMMON: Whatever Pence was hearing on Wednesday, Trump said publicly Thursday night that he had not made a final, final decision. It seems by today, he'd gotten over any doubts and decided to tie the knot. Sarah McCammon, NPR News, New York. Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "Republican vice presidential candidate Mike Pence has been involved in Indiana politics for years. But lately, his reputation at home has taken a hit, even among Republicans.  LINDA WERTHEIMER, HOST: Donald Trump will appear with his running mate this morning, Indiana Governor Mike Pence. The announcement came after a wild week of guessing who Trump's final pick would be. As Indiana Public Broadcasting's Brandon Smith reports, the decision has also created chaos in Indiana. BRANDON SMITH, BYLINE: When rumors first surfaced about Donald Trump's interest in Mike Pence as a running mate, it sent shock waves through Indiana's political scene. JOHN KETZENBERGER: I have not seen anything quite like this or anything even close to this. SMITH: That's Indiana Fiscal Policy Institute President John Ketzenberger, who's been following Indiana politics for 25 years. Pence campaigned and governed as a conservative and had a divisive reputation in the state. As governor, he signed bills that restricted access to abortion and appeared to give private businesses the right to deny services to LGBT customers. So as he prepared for re-election, Pence was looking at a tough campaign. KETZENBERGER: I don't think it's any secret that this race was going to be very close and very much a referendum on Mike Pence because he just wasn't popular. SMITH: Still, Barbara Hackman says plenty of folks in Indiana are disappointed Pence won't get a chance at four more years in the governor's mansion. But she believes Trump picked the right person. BARBARA HACKMAN: Mike is such a conservative. And with his - and I think it kind of balances out, you know, Trump's flamboyancy and Mike's just good, down home conservative values. SMITH: Hackman is the GOP chair in Pence's hometown. He even filmed the first TV commercial for his 2012 gubernatorial run on her farm. She's excited to see Pence, a former member of Congress, elevated to the national stage again. HACKMAN: I know we need to have an election, but I look forward to having Mike up in Washington, D.C., as our VP. SMITH: Pence's approval ratings at home had been negative for a while. Here's recent Indiana University graduate Sam Velazquez. SAM VELAZQUEZ: Pence makes a lot of people really angry. I don't know that this will necessarily hurt or help Trump. SMITH: Regardless of Pence's legacy, University of Indianapolis political scientist Laura Albright says all Hoosiers should be pleased to see Pence as Trump's pick. LAURA ALBRIGHT: The fact that we're able to create and cultivate such great political leadership, it's wonderful. And even for Republicans or Democrats, I think it's a win-win. SMITH: Pence's decision to run as Trump's vice president means he's not seeking re-election. Now, several prominent Republicans, including the lieutenant governor and two members of Congress, have jumped into that race, opening up even more vacancies down the ballot and unsettling Indiana politics for the forseeable future.

            "article_content": "Donald Trump's running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, disagrees with the presumptive GOP nominee on a number of notable issues.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: With a tweet, Donald Trump announced he had finally chosen a running mate, Indiana Governor Mike Pence. Pence has solid Republican credentials. He is a fiscal and social conservative, and then there's his long experience in federal and state government. He is also low key in contrast to Trump. But as NPR's Don Gonyea reports, Pence and Trump also differ on some key issues. DON GONYEA, BYLINE: Let's start with trade. Opposing trade deals, such as TPP and NAFTA, is a cornerstone of Trump's make America great again pitch to blue-collar voters. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DONALD TRUMP: We have to make smart deals. We can no longer - you know, we're losing. You look at our deficits. You look at our budget. You look at what's going on with this country. We're losing our jobs, and the politicians don't tell you that. GONYEA: Presumably, there he's talking about politicians like Pence, who was a strong advocate of international trade deals. Here he is back in 2001, a member of Congress pushing for enhanced authority for the president to quickly negotiate such agreements. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MIKE PENCE: Congressional passage of presidential trade promotion authority is absolutely essential, and I hope that Congress will do so this week. GONYEA: Pence argued then and now that trade agreements have been good for Indiana farmers and for jobs. Here is another one from way back when that Trump has made an issue of in 2016 - the war in Iraq. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PENCE: I rise in support of the resolution authorizing the use of force against Iraq. GONYEA: That's Congressman Mike Pence in 2002. Here's Trump this year on Fox News. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: It was a huge mistake, whether people like it or not, and I'm the only one with the vision to have said, don't do it. GONYEA: Though, it's also true that in 2002, before the war started, Trump appeared on \"The Howard Stern Show\" and said he supported invading Iraq. That leads nicely into a more current Trump-Pence dispute on another topic, Trump's call to ban Muslims from entering the U.S. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what the hell is going on. GONYEA: That was last December. Contrast that with what Governor Pence told reporters in Indiana that same month. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PENCE: I think comments that suggest that Muslims should be banned from the United States are offensive and unconstitutional. GONYEA: Then there's Medicaid. Pence, as governor, expanded Medicaid coverage for the poor. Trump wants to roll back such expansions as part of his plan to repeal Obamacare. That would put a Vice President Pence in the position of opposing Governor Pence's policy. The two men have also disagreed on Planned Parenthood. Pence was a sponsor of the first-ever effort in Congress to eliminate federal funds for the organization, even saying it's an issue worth shutting down the government over. But Trump, this year, said this. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: Look, Planned Parenthood has done very good work for some - for many, many - for millions of women. And I'll say it, and I know a lot of the so-called conservatives, they say that's really - because I'm a conservative, but I'm a common sense conservative. GONYEA: Though, Trump did also say that he didn't think Planned Parenthood should be providing abortion services. Still, his positive words are a departure from the kind of GOP orthodoxy that Mike Pence, his running mate, has spent a career espousing. Don Gonyea, NPR News, Washington. Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.

This post was updated Oct. 1 at 10:19 a.m. Last Monday, the first presidential debate was the most-watched debate ever. A little more than a week later, the Hillary Clinton's and Donald Trump's vice presidential picks will take the stage. Trump running mate Mike Pence will debate Clinton running mate Tim Kaine Tuesday night at Longwood University in Farmville, Va. Unlike the people at the top of the tickets, Pence and Kaine are relatively unknown to voters. On the Republican side, Pence has been governor of Indiana since 2013. Before that, he served six terms in the U.S. House of Representatives. House Speaker Paul Ryan has called Pence a \"good movement conservative\" and considers him a good friend. \"I've very high regard for him,\" Ryan said when Pence was chosen as Trump's running mate, an indicator that putting Pence on the ticket might have been an olive branch from the Trump campaign to more traditional conservatives. Here are five other things to know about Gov. Pence ahead of Tuesday's debate: Pence is a born-again Christian \u2014 he became one in college \u2014 and has put his religion in the foreground of his political persona. \"For me it all begins with faith. It begins with what matters most, and I try and put what I believe to be moral truth first. My philosophy of government second. And my politics third,\" Pence said in a 2010 appearance on the Christian Broadcasting Network. And religion has indeed played a large part in his policy decisions. One notable example is his strong opposition to abortion. While serving in the House in 2011, he introduced an amendment to defund Planned Parenthood because the women's health organization provides abortion services. This March, as governor of Indiana, Pence signed one of the most restrictive abortion laws in the country. The law bans abortions due to fetal abnormalities and also requires aborted fetuses \u2014 and those from miscarriage \u2014 to be buried or cremated. Women in Indiana protested the law by calling or tweeting at the governor's office to tell him about their periods, in an effort dubbed \"Periods For Pence.\" Trump and Pence, while different in temperament, have something in common: both men have hosted TV shows. In the 1990s, Pence hosted a Sunday TV show in Indianapolis and also had a radio talk show called The Mike Pence Show. He described himself as \"Rush Limbaugh on decaf,\" meaning while a conservative, he was not as bombastic as the popular Limbaugh, who hosts his own talk show. On his show, Pence discussed the week's news and also his conservative values. In a video from 1997 published this year by Politico, Pence discussed Kelly Flinn, who was the country's first female B-52 pilot. She had just been discharged from the Air Force for disobeying an order to end an affair and for lying under oath about doing so. On the show, Pence discussed the \"normalization of adultery\" and \"whether or not it was time to rethink this whole business of women in the military.\" After losing early campaigns for Congress, Pence wrote an essay apologizing for running negative ads against an opponent, Rep. Phillip Sharp. The Indianapolis Star has reported Pence \"swore off harsh political tactics.\" In the essay, Pence called for \"basic human decency.\" In July, Pence and Trump sat down for a joint interview on CBS' 60 Minutes. Interviewer Lesley Stahl asked Pence how he felt about some of Trump's attacks on his opponents, specifically referencing \"Lyin' Ted,\" Trump's nickname for his last-standing primary opponent, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. Pence replied: \"In the essay that I wrote a long time ago, I said campaigns ought to be about something more important than just one candidate's election. And... and this campaign and Donald Trump's candidacy has been about the issues the American people care about.\" Trump added that the two men are different people and he doesn't ask Pence to be negative. \"It's probably obvious to people that our styles are different. But I promise you, our vision is exactly the same,\" Pence added. In 2015, he signed into law a controversial \"religious freedom\" bill, which spurred wide backlash. Critics said the bill could allow business owners to ban LGBT customers based on a claim of religious freedom. After \"business, civic and sports leaders ... strongly called for a fix to the legislation,\" USA Today noted, Pence later signed a revised version of the law. But Pence appeared to back the bill in an interview on Fox in March 2015. \"Well let me say first and foremost, I stand by this law,\" he said. \"But I understand that the way that some on the left, and frankly some in the national media, have mischaracterized this law over the last week might make it necessary for us to clarify the law through legislation. And we were working through the day and into the night last night with legislative leaders to consider ways to do that.\" Although his running mate has denied his own early support of the Iraq War, Pence was in Congress at the time and voted in favor of authorizing the use of force in Iraq. In a 2002 interview with CNN leading up to the vote, Pence emphasized that there was \"overwhelming evidence... to suggest a connection between Iraq and al Qaeda,\" which ended up not being the case. When Trump was asked for his opinion on Pence's 2002 vote on 60 Minutes, he answered, \"He's entitled to make a mistake every once in awhile.\" When Pence was asked on Fox News this year about the vote, he said, \"I think that's for historians to debate. I supported President Bush's decision to go into Iraq, as well as to go into Afghanistan. I traveled downrange for 10 years in a row to visit our soldiers in Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom. I stood strongly through both of them.\"",

            "article_content": "Donald Trump campaigned with Indiana Gov. Mike Pence Tuesday, one of the rumored finalists to be his running mate. Trump has campaigned with several potential vice presidential picks in recent days.  ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: Any day now Donald Trump will announce his running mate. We can guess at some of the names that are on his short list because they've been campaigning with Trump. Indiana Governor Mike Pence is the latest vice presidential hopeful to hit the trail with Donald Trump. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MIKE PENCE: To paraphrase the director of the FBI, I think it would be extremely careless to elect Hillary Clinton as the next president of the United States. (CHEERING, APPLAUSE) SIEGEL: NPR's Sarah McCammon is in Westfield, Ind., where the two were campaigning this evening. And Sarah, what is Trump having Governor Pence do today? SARAH MCCAMMON, BYLINE: Well, Governor Pence introduced Trump and, you know, gave that - a fairly brief speech before Donald Trump took the stage. He mentioned Pence really briefly at the beginning and then again at the end of his speech. Here's how he mentioned Pence at the beginning. SIEGEL: And what kind of an impression did Mike Pence make there tonight? MCCAMMON: You know, in talking with folks beforehand, you know - he's well-known in Indiana. Obviously he's the governor. But a lot of people at this rally were kind of neither here nor there about him. You know, he seemed to draw a lot of applause during the event, but you know, my sense is that these people were here to see Donald Trump, not necessarily Governor Pence. A couple people told me they didn't know that much about him or - you know, they appreciate the fact that he's got a socially conservative reputation here in Indiana. But you know, Donald Trump is the star of the show... SIEGEL: Yep. MCCAMMON: And you know, obviously that's who he wants to be. But this is really an audition for Pence as the - we get closer to the convention and it's just about time to take a VP. SIEGEL: Well, what is it about Pence's background that would make him an attractive pick for Donald Trump? MCCAMMON: Well, as I mentioned, he is popular with social conservatives. He endorsed Texas Senator Ted Cruz in the primary, and that's a constituency that Donald Trump has struggled with a bit and needs to shore up as he heads into the general election. Mike Pence also of course as a governor has executive experience. He's a former member of Congress. Donald Trump has of course said that he wants experience with him on the ticket. But I should say, Robert, that Pence has some liability. There were some controversy over abortion restrictions that were passed by the state and supported by Pence earlier this year. Last year a religious liberty law (inaudible) supported in Indiana which gave protection to businesses that want to deny services for same-sex weddings. That sort of controversy and Pence's position was opposed by a lot of (unintelligible), and his approval rating sank here after that. One other thing is he's up against a deadline for reelection. He cannot run for governor and vice president under Indiana law, so he has until Friday to withdraw his name from the gubernatorial ballot. But conveniently, Robert, we expect Trump to (unintelligible) pretty soon. SIEGEL: Well, when do we think he might actually turn to one of his finalist and say, you're hired? MCCAMMON: That's right. Everything we're hearing is probably by Friday before the weekend. You know, there was some talk that Donald Trump might wait and make a big announcement during the GOP convention. Everything we've been hearing is probably not, which is probably good news for Mike Pence since he is facing that deadline. SIEGEL: You mentioned he has some liabilities and some virtues. They both seem to reflect his status as a leading social conservative in the GOP, no? MCCAMMON: Right. Well, you know, Donald Trump - again, he's struggled with the socially conservative base. There have been a lot of concerns among, you know, some evangelical Christians and certainly ideological conservatives about Trump's conservative bona fide (ph). You know, picking a conservative to be on the ticket with him could help him in that area, but it could also be a liability with some of the middle-of-the-road voters. So we'll see. SIEGEL: OK, thanks, Sarah. That's NPR's Sarah McCammon in Westfield, Ind., where Donald Trump is campaigning with Indiana Governor Mike Pence. Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "Republican leaning women could be key to winning Pennsylvania's electoral votes this November, and both parties are appealing to them, especially along the New Jersey border in Bucks County.  ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: The presidential race in Pennsylvania will likely come down to the suburbs around Philadelphia. Hillary Clinton is favored in the city by big margins and the rural middle of the state is expected to back Donald Trump. And that means the state's 20 electoral votes may hinge on places like Bucks County. Well, this week NPR and some member stations are taking a look at the election's battleground communities as part of our project a Nation Engaged. NPR's Scott Detrow spent some time talking to Republicans in Bucks County, and he has this report. SCOTT DETROW, BYLINE: A lot of highly educated, higher-income Republican voters live in Bucks and the surrounding so-called collar counties. Democrats think they can flip many of them, especially women, over to vote for Hillary Clinton. Jessica Schoder is 28. She works in Bucks County and volunteers for many local and state-level Republican campaigns. She's sitting in a coffee shop in Doylestown right in the middle of Bucks County between Philadelphia and Allentown. And she says both her parents are active Democrats. JESSICA SCHODER: You know, every now and then my mom - especially when I work on certain campaigns - she's like I can't believe you're a Republican, you know - that kind of thing. I'm kind of like the Alex Keaton of my family. DETROW: Schoder says she probably leaned left in college, but as she entered the workforce her viewpoints changed. SCHODER: I think I'm mostly can - you know, Republican just because like economically to me that's, you know, the big issues, you know, money and, you know, what our country's doing with the money, what personally I'm doing with my money, what's being taken of my money - that sort of thing. DETROW: And Schoder's concerned about national security. She likes what presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump is saying about it. SCHODER: He actually says, you know, he's going to do something. We need to do something. And right now I don't think anybody is really doing anything about it, and I think he has, you know, like the right at least mindset of that. DETROW: Sitting in a nearby park, 19-year-old college student Matt Schargel says national security is a top-tier issue for him, too. MATT SCHARGEL: The American people don't feel certain. We wake up on a Saturday morning and see that there is another terrorist attack or mass shooting. DETROW: Crossing Main Street Schargel takes in the town. SCHARGEL: Yeah. I'd say Doylestown is kind of one of your all-American towns. If you looked down the block, you'd see a movie theater, restaurants, lots of shops. DETROW: The county used to be firmly Republican. But Barack Obama won it by a sliver in 2012. And in the recent GOP primary, Trump carried nearly 6 in 10 Republican voters. Like Jessica Schoder Schargel is a hyper-involved Republican. He says he really got hooked on politics in 2004 when his dad brought him to a George W. Bush rally. SCHARGEL: And I'll always remember sitting on my dad's shoulders watching President Bush speak and just being taken aback by the whole thing. DETROW: Schargel can't imagine himself ever voting for Hillary Clinton. And yet... SCHARGEL: At this point, I would say I am 70 percent certain I'm not supporting Donald Trump. DETROW: Trump's demeanor, his track record has Schargel turned off. SCHARGEL: I think it's pretty sad. Since high school I've been devoted Republican but I believe our nominee doesn't share the ideals of this party, and I think he lacks the character discipline to hold the highest office in the land. DETROW: Jessica Schoder disagrees. SCHODER: I think so. I mean, I definitely think he's a little more intense, definitely than I am, you know, and he's a bit intense on some issues. But, I mean, his core values - it seems, you know, he does, you know, a very, you know - he's fiscally conservative, you know, doesn't agree with abortion - that kind of thing, you know, things that I agree with - so yeah. DETROW: So will Schoder vote for Trump? SCHODER: Well, you know, I mean, I don't know how to describe it. You know, he's not my favorite, but, you know, I'm most likely 90 percent going to vote for him. DETROW: Democrats will likely spend a lot of time and money on that 10 percent likelihood that she may do something else. Scott Detrow, NPR News. Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "Both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are vetting their shortlists of vice presidential contenders. With the GOP convention starting in eight days, Trump could name his running mate any day now.  MICHEL MARTIN, HOST: Now it's time for our feature Word You'll Hear. That's where we try to understand what's happening in the news by parsing some of the words associated with them. Here's a hint about today's word. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"VEEP\") JULIA LOUIS-DREYFUS: (As Selina Meyer) Would you please hang up the phone because I'm the [expletive] vice president of the United States, and I have something to say. MARTIN: That, of course, is Julia Louis-Dreyfus from the TV show \"Veep.\" And that's this week's word as in vice president. And we know it's not really a word, but we're going with it because there's just a week to go until the nominating conventions for the major political parties start. And if history is any guide, we should hear Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton announcing their running mates soon. NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson is watching all of this, so she's going to tell us more. Hi, Mara. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Hi, Michel. MARTIN: So I know we always ask this, but I still have to ask this. Has it ever really made a difference whom they pick? LIASSON: It's a really good question because it's been a very long time since a vice presidential pick delivered his own home state, like Lyndon Johnson did for John Kennedy. Generally, they don't. But they can harm your ticket. You could argue that Sarah Palin hurt John McCain. So overall you don't want to do any harm. And the most important thing is you want somebody ready to be president. There are other considerations. Sometimes a vice presidential pick can reinforce your brand the way Bill Clinton did with Al Gore, another young centrist Democrat from a border state. Sometimes they can help you with a wing of the party or a certain demographic. MARTIN: So what do we know about who is on each person's list? LIASSON: Well, on Trump's list, we know because some of the people have been campaigning with him like a reality show tryout. Mike Pence has done it. He's popular with Christian conservatives. Chris Christie the governor of New Jersey will be with him this week. Newt Gingrich former House speaker, but also an insurgent in his own way, has campaigned with him. He would reinforce Trump's brand. It would be an Al Gore-type choice. And then there's retired Lieutenant General Michael Flynn, who Trump has talked about. But today on ABC, he revealed himself to be pro-choice and immediately the pro-life group said he should not be picked as vice president. It is, however, a time-tested tradition for outsider candidates like Trump to choose a military figure. Ross Perot chose Admiral Stockdale and George Wallace chose Curtis LeMay. MARTIN: Well, what about Hillary Clinton? Who is she looking at? LIASSON: Tim Kaine, the senator from Virginia, former governor, is at the top of her list. He comes from an important swing state that she needs. He also speaks fluent Spanish and has been chairman of the Democratic Party. Elizabeth Warren would help her with progressives. Sherrod Brown would help her in the Rust Belt, which is an area where Trump is very strong. But Warren and Brown share a deficit which is they come from states with Republican governors. If they won, they would presumably be replaced by Republican senators. MARTIN: So before we go, any sense of the timing of these announcements? You know, normally, you hear about these at the nominating convention or just before. Do we expect that pattern to hold or do you think there'll be something different this year? LIASSON: I suspect that pattern to hold. We only have a week to go before Cleveland, so Trump will probably reveal his VP pick in about a week. Hillary has an extra week, but she might want to try and steal some of Trump's thunder and announce her choice right at the end of the Republican convention. MARTIN: That's Mara Liasson, NPR's national political correspondent. Thanks, Mara. LIASSON: Thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "Donald Trump insists he didn't mean anything anti-Semitic by his weekend tweet depicting Democratic rival Hillary Clinton alongside a six-point star and piles of $100 bills. Assuming that's true, it's yet another unforced error for the Trump campaign, in what's become an almost constant stream of errors, gaffes and other blunders. Trump often touts his millions of social media followers. But his freewheeling style \u2014 online and on the stump \u2014 has gotten him into trouble many times during this campaign for insensitive, inaccurate or questionably sourced tweets. The \"sheriff's star\" This weekend, he blamed members of the \"dishonest media\" for suggesting that the six-point star was meant to represent a Star of David \u2014 many of whom spent the weekend waiting for the campaign to respond to requests for clarification. Eventually, Trump's social media director, Dan Scavino Jr., picked up the theme, tweeting: \"For the MSM to suggest that I am antisemite is AWFUL. I proudly celebrate holidays w/ my wife's amazing Jewish family for the past 16 years.\" For the MSM to suggest that I am antisemite is AWFUL. I proudly celebrate holidays w/ my wife's amazing Jewish family for the past 16 years. But it was more than a suggestion: As the website Mic reported, the image originated with white supremacists online. In a statement, Scavino said the star-shaped image, which he called a \"sheriff's badge,\" was sourced from an anti-Clinton Twitter account. Scavino said he chose to remove it to avoid offending anyone. The \"sheriff's star\" explanation drew a fair amount of skepticism and derision. White supremacist links and taco bowls The \"sheriff's star\" incident drew praise from white supremacist leader David Duke. But it's far from the first time Trump's been accused of coziness with white supremacists \u2014 on Twitter and elsewhere. Nice to see Mr. Trump slipping some 'Red Pills' to the American people! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #AmericaFirst https://t.co/UERKZgS88n Earlier this year, Trump was slow to distance himself from Duke's support \u2014 though under pressure, Trump eventually disavowed Duke. Back in November, Trump tweeted out a graphic that grossly overstated the rate of black-on-white murder. The graphic claimed that most murders of white people are committed by African-Americans, when in fact most whites are killed by other whites. It came at a time when Trump was being criticized for seeming to encourage violence toward protesters at his rallies, including several who were African-American. Even when Trump tries to reach out to minority groups, he does so clumsily \u2014 like the infamous \"taco bowl\" tweet in celebration of Cinco de Mayo, or his awkward reference to \"my African-American over there\" when pointing out a black supporter at a rally. From \"Brexit\" to Mussolini There was also the time, in February, when Trump retweeted a quote that turned out to have come from the fascist dictator Benito Mussolini: \"@ilduce2016: ?It is better to live one day as a lion than 100 years as a sheep.? ? @realDonaldTrump #MakeAmericaGreatAgain\" Trump leaned in to that one, telling NBC he wants to \"be associated with interesting quotes.\" On several occasions, Trump's posts have shown him to be misinformed or lacking knowledge of important pieces of context. Upon landing in Scotland the morning after the so-called \"Brexit\" vote by British citizens to leave the European Union, Trump tweeted, \"Just arrived in Scotland. Place is going wild over the vote\": Just arrived in Scotland. Place is going wild over the vote. They took their country back, just like we will take America back. No games! As many online were quick to point out, Scotland actually voted overwhelmingly to stay in the EU, a result at odds with the vote in the U.K. as a whole. Not on message \u2014 and maybe not legal Trump's missteps online are mirrored by other gaffes in real life. His campaign apparently slipped up last month by sending out fundraising emails to foreign officials \u2014 even though such donations are against federal law. Then, there are simple verbal misstatements \u2014 like referring to the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, as \"7/11\" instead of \"9/11\" during an appearance in Buffalo, N.Y., ahead of that state's primary. What's politically worse for Trump is when he reveals himself to be out of step with important voting blocs within his party on major issues like abortion. Shortly before the Wisconsin primary \u2014 a state where Trump faced substantial opposition from social conservatives \u2014 Trump flubbed an answer to a question about abortion when he told MSNBC's Chris Matthews he believed there should be some form of punishment for women who seek illegal abortions. Trump walked that back by getting back on message with a statement saying that he only would support punishment for doctors who perform abortions \u2014 but not before he astonished and offended many anti-abortion rights activist leaders. Too late to say \"sorry\"? In an earlier example, Trump told a group of evangelicals in Iowa in July 2015 that he couldn't recall having ever sought forgiveness from God \u2014 a major misstep in that crowd. It may not be asking God for forgiveness, but Trump did acknowledge he'd made a \"mistake\" by tweeting out an unflattering image of then-rival Texas Sen. Ted Cruz's wife, Heidi Cruz, alongside a modeling photo of his own wife, Melania, in late March. Trump told New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd that if he had a do-over, he \"wouldn't have sent it.\" Still, if the months since then are any indication, Trump isn't showing much hesitancy to send tweets that many observers find offensive, and that many of his supporters say they find refreshingly authentic.",

            "article_content": "NPR's Robert Siegel talks with NPR's Nina Totenberg and Tom Goldstein of SCOTUSblog about all the happenings this past session and the lack of a ninth justice on the court.  ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: The Supreme Court wrapped up its term yesterday with a blockbuster decision on abortion rights, plus the important decisions limiting public corruption, prosecutions and gun rights. It has been an extraordinary term marked prominently by the death of conservative icon Antonin Scalia. Joining us to talk about the term are Tom Goldstein, publisher of SCOTUSblog and NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg. Hi to both of you. TOM GOLDSTEIN: Hello. NINA TOTENBERG, BYLINE: Hello. SIEGEL: Tom, you've been crunching the numbers about this term looking for trends. What kind of patterns have you seen? GOLDSTEIN: So this term we saw many fewer of those cases that turn on just one vote, the super close cases. We saw the justices in the center, not just Justice Kennedy, but also Justices Kagan and Breyer really being the justices who voted closest together, not a bloc of liberals or a bloc of conservatives. And we saw the chief justice, the leader of the Supreme Court not getting involved in very divisive cases writing those opinions, but instead sticking to things that seem to be 9 to 0 or 8 to 0. TOTENBERG: There are plenty of cases this term - the biggest cases - affirmative action, abortion - where Justice Kennedy, once again, is sort of the king swing vote. But there are other cases that got less attention where this cluster of centrists - one at least of them makes the difference. So there was a big and very important case involving the search of somebody who's illegally stopped. Then you find out there's a warrant out for his arrest. Can you use what you search? When you search him, can you use the bad stuff you find? And the answer from the court was yes. And Justice Breyer moved over to be with the conservatives and be the linchpin in that case. SIEGEL: Now, usually we talk about lots of 5-4 decisions. Obviously there haven't been a lot of 5-4 decisions because there've only been eight justices this time. How has that affected what's happened, Tom? GOLDSTEIN: Well, I think you've seen the court try and avoid huge disputes. A couple of things either happened. One is that the conservatives were disappointed, and you got a more liberal outcome in, say, the affirmative action case or the abortion case, where the left won or the court just tried to come up with some big compromise, where it was that they rejected a major challenge to the contraception mandate of the Affordable Care Act, but still left open the need to come up with something to accommodate the religious objections. TOTENBERG: We've heard privately and even publicly this term from the justices saying, look, we know we're eight justices. We know there are some cases we're inevitably going to be tied. But we want those to be minimal, and we don't know when we're going to fill that seat. So we really need to do our very best to come up with something. SIEGEL: What do the decisions of this term tell you about the individual justices? And, you know, why don't you start with Justice Anthony Kennedy whom you've both already mentioned seems to be a very important figure in this job? TOTENBERG: Well, this was supposed to be the term that was sort of the revenge of the right where they would prevail on affirmative action, where they would prevail on abortion, and it didn't happen in large part because of Scalia's death. But interestingly, Justice Kennedy was not only the linchpin in those cases. He was, I would say, more comfortable with his position on abortion and affirmative action - more, if you can say so, slightly to the left on those - in those cases. And there's a conspiracy theory that I've gotten from a lot of court watchers and scholars, and they think, well, he knows that the court is likely to be more liberal if Clinton wins. And, therefore, he's moving to the left, so he can preserve his influence. I just think that's a crock. What do you think, Tom? GOLDSTEIN: Yeah. (LAUGHTER) SIEGEL: But thanks for introducing us... TOTENBERG: Yeah, but you're going to hear more of it. Tom, what do you think? GOLDSTEIN: Yeah, I agree with Nina here. I think what's going on is that conservatives who had such high hopes for this term, as Nina suggested, were these hot-button issues. And they had a conservative majority - were disappointed, and they've been disappointed a lot over the past few years either in Justice Kennedy or in Chief Justice Roberts And so they - want to say is I never really believed he was with us anyway. He was always a flip-flopper. He was never our guy, when, in fact, Justice Kennedy's views can be quite nuanced on these things. SIEGEL: Well, in reading opinions by Justice Kennedy and watching how he votes over the years, would you say that he has actually changed, that he's - his thinking is different today than it was 10, 20 years ago? TOTENBERG: Probably. That was true with Justice O'Connor. And I think sometimes when you have a hard right or a hard left, they can push the other side more in the other direction. And I think that's happened a bit with justices who are basically conservative, but not that conservative. SIEGEL: Well, the court will be back in the fall, still with just eight justices. What impact is that having on the court's docket for next year? GOLDSTEIN: Well, for a while it looked like the court was just going out of business, that it just wasn't going to take many cases at all. They did... SIEGEL: How much is a lot of cases, by the way? GOLDSTEIN: Well, you know, usually they have about 35 cases at this point in the year, and they were down in the 15-20 range. Now, at the very end, they picked up a bunch of cases, so they're not going out of business. They're just trying to put us to sleep, I think is the way of looking at it. (LAUGHTER) TOTENBERG: They're really boring. I got to cover a lot of the election. SIEGEL: So, Nina, what's your best guess as to when we might get a ninth justice actually sitting on the court? TOTENBERG: Well, I think the prospects after the election if Clinton wins are about 50/50 that there's a lame-duck vote and Merrick Garland can take his seat probably in December. If that doesn't happen, we won't get somebody next term because you have to wait for a new president. There won't be hearings until probably February or March on anybody. And then by the end of April, they've - they're done hearing cases and somebody gets sworn in in April. We'll have to wait 'til the next term to do the real work. GOLDSTEIN: Yeah, my guess is that if Hillary Clinton wins, there will be a race by Republicans to confirm the more centrist Merrick Garland who's also 63-years-old. They are not going to want to take the chance that Hillary Clinton's going to put up somebody much younger and much more liberal. SIEGEL: Tom Goldstein publisher of SCOTUSblog, NPR's Nina Totenberg, thanks to both of you. GOLDSTEIN: Thank you. TOTENBERG: Thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "The Supreme Court ruled Monday on a case out of Texas with major implications for access to abortion services.  KELLY MCEVERS, HOST: The U.S. Supreme Court has struck down a Texas abortion law that was enacted in the name of protecting the health and safety of women. In a vote of 5 to 3, the court in essence declared this health and safety justification was not much more than a ruse and that the real reason was to limit access to abortion. The decision is the most sweeping abortion ruling in nearly 25 years, and it's likely to invalidate similar provisions in at least a dozen other states. NPR's legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg reports. NINA TOTENBERG, BYLINE: The Texas law required abortion clinic doctors to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital, and it required the clinics be designed and equipped to be mini hospitals with wide corridors, large operating rooms, advanced HVAC systems, et cetera. Writing for the court majority, Justice Stephen Breyer said both these provisions are unconstitutional. He said they impose an undue burden on a woman's right to abortion, the very kind of obstacles specifically forbidden by the court in its last major abortion ruling in 1992. He said the regulations imposed by the state were unnecessary and counterproductive. They caused nearly half the clinics in the state to close, the result being that women were forced to drive hundreds of miles and often wait weeks to get an abortion. The court said that nothing in the evidence of this case show that the hospital admitting privileges requirement added anything to the protocol that existed before this law was enacted. Under that protocol, doctors had arrangements to admit patients to local hospitals through other doctors who did have admitting privileges. Indeed, Justice Breyer noted that when lawyers for Texas were asked directly at oral argument whether the state knew of a single instance in which the new law helped one woman get better treatment, the answer was that there was no evidence such a case existed. As to the surgical centers, the court said that the law's requirements were, quote, \"nearly arbitrary.\" For instance, the law requires even those patients seeking a medical abortion to take a pill at a surgical center even though any possible complications typically happen long after the patient has left the facility. More to the point, the court noted that surgical abortions are among the safest procedures in the country. Childbirth which Texas allows to take place at home is 14 times more likely to result in death than an abortion, and a colonoscopy which can take place in a doctor's office has 10 times the mortality rate. Indeed the court observed that the procedure for dealing with a miscarriage is the same as an abortion, but the miscarriage procedure can be done in a doctor's office. Abortion rights supporters were not only elated. They said the decision underlined and amplified the rights articulated in the court's last major abortion decision in 1992. Nancy Northup is president of the Center for Reproductive Rights. NANCY NORTHUP: What they did today is really put the teeth into what that standard is. TOTENBERG: Notre Dame law professor Richard Garnett, an abortion opponent, agreed. RICHARD GARNETT: The version of the undue burden test that comes out of this I do think is significantly more demanding. TOTENBERG: Indeed he added, it does seem that the court is no longer willing to just take the legislature's word when it says it's enacting a law to protect women's health and safety in regards to abortion. Jim Bopp, counsel for the National Right to Life Committee, was disheartened. JIM BOPP: But I think it's just appalling. TOTENBERG: But Cornell law professor Michael Dorf noted that the battle is not over. MICHAEL DORF: On the one hand, it shows there are five solid votes regardless of who replaces Justice Scalia to say that abortion cannot be banned and that it can't be eroded through death by a thousand cuts. On the other hand, the justices in the majority won't be on the Supreme Court forever, and the dissenters show no sign of giving up. TOTENBERG: Indeed Justice Samuel Alito in dissent accused the majority of bending the procedural rules of the law in a way that would not be acceptable for anything other than abortion. He was joined by Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Thomas who also wrote separately. Alito conceded in his dissent that the Texas law did cause some clinics to close, but he said the law was intended to force unsafe facilities to close, like the notorious clinic in Pennsylvania run by Kermit Gosnell. The majority replied that the deplorable conditions in Gosnell's clinic would not have been cured by another layer of regulation since the only reason Gosnell's facility managed to survive for as long as it did was that it went uninspected for more than 15 years. Joining Breyer in the majority were the court's three female justices and Justice Anthony Kennedy. As decisive as today's ruling would appear to be, state legislatures will likely continue to pass new abortion restrictions. Indiana Solicitor General Thomas Fisher notes an ongoing legal battle in his state. THOMAS FISHER: We have a law that prohibits abortion in the context of, you know, a disability diagnosis. TOTENBERG: In short, a ban when the only reason for the abortion is that the fetus would be born with a disability. For now though, the abortion wars will likely not be focused on the Supreme Court but on the presidential election campaign. Nina Totenberg, NPR News, Washington. Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.

            "article_content": "The Supreme Court's decision striking down Texas laws limiting abortion access could have significant impacts in other states.  KELLY MCEVERS, HOST: At the U.S. Supreme Court today - the most sweeping abortion ruling in decades. The justices struck down a Texas law that imposed restrictions on both clinics and the doctors who perform the procedure. The court strongly rejected the argument made by abortion rights opponents that the measures improved women's health and safety. The decision could be felt beyond Texas because states across the country have passed a record number of abortion restrictions in recent years. NPR's Jennifer Ludden joins us now to sort through this. Hi. JENNIFER LUDDEN, BYLINE: Hi. MCEVERS: So OK, first, the Texas law that was struck down - it had forced half of that state's clinics that perform abortions to close, and we've reported on how that's left many women waiting for weeks just to get an appointment or, you know, having to travel hundreds of miles to get to a clinic. Does this ruling mean that all those clinics that were closed can now reopen? LUDDEN: It does, but it's not going to happen overnight. So abortion rights groups say, look; they've lost the leases for those buildings. Their licenses have expired. They have let the staff go. They've got to start fundraising, get the doctors back, find a space. It is a long process. MCEVERS: Do other states have the same law on the books, and what would this ruling mean for them? LUDDEN: Yes, they do, and we have actually already seen an impact. This afternoon, Alabama's attorney general announced he is dropping his defense of the state law because it's too close to the one in Texas. It forces doctors to have admitting privileges at a local hospital. Other states also like Texas require hospital-style building codes for clinics. Now, challenges to some of these laws may just play out, but abortion rights groups are confident that they will be found unconstitutional. MCEVERS: Let's talk about some of the other abortion restrictions in the states. Does today's Supreme Court ruling in this Texas case affect them? LUDDEN: Well, directly, not necessarily. I mean we've had, you know, more than 250 abortion restrictions in the past five years - an unprecedented wave, everything from a ban on abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy, waiting periods up to three days in some states, forcing doctors to do an ultrasound of a fetus and show it to the woman. In the past year, a few states have passed bans on the most common type of abortion procedure in the second trimester - all kinds of laws. There's no direct impact on these, and abortion opponents today are saying, we are still going to advocate for these restrictions and others in state legislatures and in courts. But abortion rights groups really see this ruling today as giving them a huge new edge in this state-by-state battle. MCEVERS: So why do they think they have this new edge? LUDDEN: Because this is the first time that the court has spelled out what it meant - it - when it had its last big abortion ruling back in 1992, it said, OK, you can restrict abortion but not if it poses an undue burden. And really, this whole battle since then has been to try and figure out what poses an undue burden. And today the justices said that the courts must weigh the burden a law imposes along with whatever benefits it claims to have. And it specifically said this is the court's role. Also this ruling cites a lot of evidence about how these Texas laws do not improve women's health and safety, and this really strikes at the heart of the argument that abortion opponents have been making to push all sorts of restrictions. So abortion rights groups say this ruling supports their view that these are sham laws, as they call them, and their real aim is to close clinics. They are very confident that this is going to mark a dramatic shift and start to roll back this wave of abortion restrictions. MCEVERS: What are some of the states where you see some of these battles happening (inaudible)? LUDDEN: Well, we've seen them in states with Republican-controlled legislature. This has really happened since the 2010 elections when you had a wave of Republicans taking control of state legislatures and a lot of Republican governors. And those are the states with the most restrictions, and some of them have numerous restrictions every year. And every year, there's a new kind of law that's passed. So every - you know, the abortion opponents have been trying to find new ways to restrict this procedure. And you know, they say this is a big blow to that effort, but they're not saying that they're going to stop. They're not going to give up. MCEVERS: That's NPR's Jennifer Ludden. Thank you.

Most Donald Trump events kick off with music from Elton John or the Rolling Stones at deafening volumes. But praise choruses ruled the day Tuesday as hundreds of conservative Christians gathered at a hotel in Times Square to question Trump. Under glittering pink-and-white chandeliers, evangelicals and conservative Catholics filled the large ballroom, some raising their hands and closing their eyes as they sang, \"Seek ye first the Kingdom of God/And his righteousness/And all these things shall be added unto you.\" The meeting was closed-door and invitation-only, but NPR was granted permission to observe the event. 'We Love Each Other' As soon as Trump entered the room, it quickly became clear this was a largely friendly audience. The moderator, former Republican presidential hopeful and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, told Trump this would not be an \"inquisition,\" but rather people had come because they want someone who will \"lead this nation out of the abyss.\" Organizer Bill Dallas of the Christian group United in Purpose says the event was designed to give religious conservatives, some of whom have had concerns about Trump, a chance to \"understand\" him better before the November election. It started out as a meeting for about 100 leaders but quickly grew to nearly 1,000 after a \"tidal wave\" of interest. The next president is going to be very vital ... in freeing up your religion, freeing up your thoughts. You really don't have religious freedom. Donald Trump \"That shows we all love each other,\" Trump told the group. Huckabee began by asking Trump about his family, saying that he'd seen them up close: \"People can fake it on stage, they can walk out and do the happy family moment, but you can't fake that backstage.\" Trump thanked Huckabee for the \"nice question,\" and said, \"I have great children. ... Through God they were born intelligent, they all went to great colleges.\" He added that he always advised them all to avoid alcohol, drugs and smoking. Trump drew applause for another bit of parenting advice: \"If they do go to church, and if they start at a young age, that's a tremendous asset ... because you don't see that as much today. ... That's not so automatic anymore.\" 'You Don't Really Have Religious Freedom' Trump then turned to what evangelical leaders have told him is a top priority \u2013 religious freedom. Many conservative Christians say they feel threatened by lawsuits aimed at requiring business owners to provide services for same-sex weddings, restrictions on prayer in public schools, and a growing move to allow transgender people to use the restrooms they choose. \"The next president is going to be very vital ... in freeing up your religion, freeing up your thoughts,\" Trump said. \"You really don't have religious freedom.\" Clergy leaders demonstrated outside the hotel in New York's Times Square where Donald Trump met with evangelical clergy Tuesday.\n                \n                    \n                    Richard Drew/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Clergy leaders demonstrated outside the hotel in New York's Times Square where Donald Trump met with evangelical clergy Tuesday. Trump said ministers, in particular, are \"petrified\" of talking about politics because of IRS rules barring groups like churches that receive charitable tax exemptions from engaging in political advocacy. \"We are gonna get rid of that,\" Trump said, though he did not specify how he'd change the law. Pastors aren't allowed to endorse candidates from the pulpit, but that rule is rarely enforced. Doubting Hillary Clinton This election that is coming up is not about a person. ... It's about America and what America represents. Ben Carson Fresh from a smaller group meeting between Trump and about 40 key leaders, Nebraska businessman Charles Herbster announced, \"We just spent time with the next president of the United States, Donald J. Trump.\" Trump had just met with members of the steering committee that helped organize the event \u2014 including Tony Perkins of the Family Research Council, psychologist and radio host James Dobson, Bob Vander Plaats of The Family Leader and longtime activist Gary Bauer. From that room, the Rev. E.W. Jackson tweeted a video of a moment where Trump questioned Democratic rival Hillary Clinton's faith, saying we don't know \"anything about Hillary in terms of religion. You know, she's been in the public eye for years and years, and yet there's no, there's nothing out there, there's, like, nothing out there.\" Trump continued: \"You can pray for your leaders, and I agree with that \u2014 pray for everyone \u2014 but what you really have to do is you have to pray to get everyone out to vote for one specific person.\" Clinton has spoken openly about her Methodist faith, and often campaigns in black churches. Event organizer Dallas, CEO of the group United in Purpose, says he will issue a similar invitation to Clinton to meet with Christian leaders, probably in the next couple of weeks. Questioning Trump's Beliefs For about an hour on Tuesday, Trump took questions from a pre-selected handful of Christian leaders, among them Dobson, outgoing Southern Baptist Convention President Ronnie Floyd and Perkins. The Rev. Sammy Rodriguez, who leads a network of Latino churches, told Trump, \"We are not in favor of amnesty, but you talked about building a wall. ... There is an idea in the Latino community that you have no commitment whatsoever in building a bridge with the Hispanic American community.\" Trump responded by repeating a common theme from the campaign trail \u2014 the importance of border security \u2014 and added that he has \"thousands\" of Latinos working with him, who are \"phenomenal people.\" Dobson asked one of several questions about religious freedom, to which Trump reiterated his promise to appoint conservative Supreme Court justices. He said he would soon announce several more potential nominees to the court, to go along with the 11 he's already suggested. \"They will be great intellects, talented men at what they do \u2014 and women \u2014 but also be pro-life,\" Trump said. In that answer, Trump took aim at his Democratic rival: \"If Hillary gets in ... we know exactly what's gonna happen. We're gonna end up being a different country ... a Venezuela.\" LGBT Rights: All About The Judges Trump was less comfortable addressing questions about LGBT rights \u2014 an issue he's been stressing in the wake of the massacre in Orlando. Kelly Shackelford of the conservative legal organization First Liberty asked for his take on pending cases involving gay and lesbian weddings \u2014 what he described as an \"attempt to use gay rights to trump religious freedom.\" Trump steered away from the issue, saying such decisions ultimately will be made in court, and, \"If it's my judges, you know how they're gonna decide, and if it's her judges, you also know how they're gonna decide.\" Trump returned to the subject of religion, bringing up his proposed temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States, saying, \"I was met with tremendous rebuke \u2014 and praise. I was met with everything ... but if I said something about Christianity, it would be a whole different thing. We can't let that happen.\" He added that things were different \"when I used to go to church,\" telling the crowd, \"You're the most powerful group in the country, but you have to band together.\" There's no perfect person \u2014 there's only one, and that's the Lord Jesus Christ, but he's not running for president of the United States. Franklin Graham As Huckabee wrapped up the question-and-answer session, he quipped, \"After what you said about church and going to church, I have a feeling you're going to have a thousand invitations to show up at churches every Sunday.\" Voting By Default There was no time for most people in the room to directly question Trump. But an afternoon panel discussion allowed for a larger group conversation about Trump's appearance. Several speakers expressed concern about whether Trump is conservative enough on LGBT issues. Greg Quinlan of the group Parents and Friends of Ex-Gays & Gays, who describes himself as a \"former homosexual,\" was among those who raised the subject. \"The big elephant in the room for us is the homosexual agenda, whose objective is to silence the church, period. I was a part of that movement, I know exactly what they are doing,\" Quinlan said. \"What are we going to do to address the homosexual agenda, the homosexual juggernaut, and what will Donald Trump do? We know what Hillary Clinton will do because her initials are HRC \u2014 Human Rights Campaign,\" he said, referring to a group known for its activism on issues including LGBT rights. Quinlan suggested getting together a \"panel of ex-gays\" to meet with Trump to explain that \"people can change.\" To that, Ralph Reed of the Faith & Freedom Coalition nodded. He mentioned Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal's veto of a \"religious liberty\" law earlier this year after objections from business and gay rights groups. \"There has been an alliance built between the radical gay lobby and corporate America to intimidate these governors from signing that kind of legislation,\" Reed said. Similar concerns lingered for Jim Garlow, pastor of Skyline Church in San Diego, though he described Trump's relatively buttoned-down demeanor in front of the group as \"very presidential.\" \"I hope somebody can help him connect the dots,\" Garlow said, that many debates surrounding the courts \"all boil down to the homosexual or transgender issue.\" Perkins, of the Family Research Council, managed to work in a joke about the debate over transgender rights and a jab at Clinton in one swing. During a discussion about whether female voters would turn out in large numbers for Clinton, Perkins said, \"I was puzzled that somebody on the left would run with gender being their top issue \u2014 given that it could change.\" That drew laughter and applause from the room. For many of those in attendance, the election boils down to a choice between Trump, whose track record causes them some heartburn, and Clinton, who they believe would continue the legacy of President Obama. And for many, that's a nonstarter. \"There's no chance for me to vote for Hillary Clinton in November, so by default I will be voting for Trump. But my vote for Trump is insufficient. He needs me to get 10 more people to vote for Trump,\" said former U.N. ambassador Ken Blackwell. Blackwell said he came away feeling like Trump needs to continue to \"flesh out this relationship.\" The big question, he said, is whether he will spend his \"political capital\" getting other conservative Christians to vote. Not A 'Coronation' At the beginning of the day, a speaker had prayed that, \"If there is to be a coronation today, let it be of Jesus as King.\" It wasn't quite that, but much of the slate of speakers was made up of people friendly to Trump. The moderator, Huckabee, has endorsed Trump. So has Ben Carson, the retired neurosurgeon and another former presidential candidate who had strong support from religious conservatives. He helped organize the event, and told the audience, \"This election that is coming up is not about a person. ... It's about America and what America represents.\" Carson told the crowd God is like a \"grandmaster\" chess player, and seemed to compare Trump to a chess piece that's usually considered the weakest one: \"Sometimes he uses a pawn; sometimes he does things in a way that is not very apparent to us. And that's where faith comes in.\" Moving to a fresh analogy, Carson argued that the nation is going the wrong direction under the leadership of President Obama, and now is no time for conservative voters to be overly choosy. \"We have to stop the ship, we have to turn it around, and then we have to sail it in the other direction,\" he said, adding that the first step is to \"stop the ship\" \u2014 and then turn it around. \"I'm not going to tell you who to vote for ... but it should be very apparent who is for religious liberty.\" President Obama angered many religious conservatives by endorsing same-sex marriage in 2013 and celebrating the Supreme Court rulings that have extended marriage rights to same-sex couples. The Obama administration has also been in legal battles with religious institutions that are fighting against the Affordable Care Act's requirement that they provide coverage for contraceptives for employees. The Supreme Court punted on that issue last month. Hillary Clinton has made preserving the Affordable Care Act and championing gay rights tenets of her campaign. Franklin Graham, the son of evangelist the Rev. Billy Graham, addressed Trump's personal flaws that bother some evangelicals \u2014 including his multiple marriages, past support for abortion rights and foul language. Graham pointed out that in lots of stories in the Bible, people messed up. After all, Graham told the crowd of devout Christians, the prophet Moses led his people out of slavery in Egypt but disobeyed God; King David committed adultery and murder; and the apostle Peter, who, as one of Jesus' closest followers, really should have had his back, denied three times that he'd ever known Jesus. \"There is none of us that are perfect,\" Graham said. \"There's no perfect person \u2014 there's only one, and that's the Lord Jesus Christ, but he's not running for president of the United States.\"",

            "article_content": "For many Republicans worried about Donald Trump's chances in the general election, his rhetoric isn't necessarily the biggest concern \u2014 it's the state of his campaign.  KELLY MCEVERS, HOST: Donald Trump's time with evangelical leaders came a day after he fired his controversial campaign manager Corey Lewandowski. But that is not stopping the panic among Republicans. Here's NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: For weeks, Republican strategists like John Feehery have watched with dismay as Trump squandered one opportunity after another. JOHN FEEHERY: A lot of people are concerned that, you know, he doesn't know what he's doing. I think the fact that he fired Corey Lewandowski is probably a good sign. Now the question is, can the campaign right itself quickly, and can we get this guy on message and start running a real campaign? LIASSON: Feehery is not a never-Trumper. Neither is Tom Davis, former congressman and chairman of the party's congressional campaign committee. TOM DAVIS: He's got to start raising money. He's got to start getting disciplined in what he says and not offending every group and speaking spontaneously. Presidential candidates can't do that. Hillary Clinton doesn't do that. This is the most undisciplined campaign that I have ever seen at this level. It's in a class by itself. LIASSON: Yes, there are still Republicans with moral, ethical or ideological objections to Trump. A handful of Republican senators and governors are refusing to endorse him, and House Speaker Paul Ryan recently said Republicans should vote their conscience. But most Republicans were ready to get on board even though they disagreed with Trump on blowing up trade deals, building a wall, banning Muslims or returning to the gold standard. Davis says Republicans were willing to put those issues, as big as they are, aside because the stakes are so high. DAVIS: If it means control of the Supreme Court and, more importantly, the regulatory agencies, that's a huge price for a lot of the base Republican constituencies. So they will put up with a lot. But when you have a candidate that doesn't seem interested in winning, doesn't seem to have a clue as to how you win, then I think people become very disengaged. LIASSON: That's a pretty damning thing to say about a candidate whose campaign message and personal brand are all about winning. At a rally in Atlanta last week, Trump made it clear what he thought about all this criticism. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DONALD TRUMP: Just please be quiet. Don't talk. Please be quiet. Just be quiet to the leaders because they have to get tougher. They have to get sharper. They have to get smarter. We have to have our Republicans either stick together or let me just do it by myself. I'll do very well. LIASSON: Republican pollster Kellyanne Conway, who ran a Super PAC for Ted Cruz in the primaries, agrees with Trump on this. KELLYANNE CONWAY: Some people sound like a bunch of big baby whiners. If you want to be helpful, you need to look no further than the professional and political left and the candidate Hillary Clinton. Do you want her brand of government-run healthcare? Do you want abortion on demand - anyone, anytime, anywhere? Do you want climate change to be said - as so many of the left do - as the most pressing national security issue of our time after we see clearly last week in Orlando what the most pressing national security issue of our time really is? LIASSON: The desire to stop Hillary Clinton might in the end be enough to help Trump bring his party together. But not yet, says Republican strategist and former Kasich advisor Vin Weber. VIN WEBER: The people that want us all to fall in line behind Donald Trump are making that argument. They start with the Supreme Court, and then they go on to a president who would sign a legislative agenda passed by a Republican Congress. And all that does matter to me. It matters as a great, great, great deal - a great deal. But I have to weigh that against what it would mean to have a president who mouths things that appear to be racist and sexist and bigoted and who divides our country much more than it's even currently divided. LIASSON: Weber is concerned about Trump's lack of political infrastructure. The Trump campaign only has 70 people on staff. Clinton has 700. Trump has aired no TV ads, and he doesn't have much of a field organization. But there's something else that worries Weber, who's run the policy teams for Republican presidential candidates since the mid-1980s. WEBER: Near as I can tell, Trump has no policy operation whatsoever - not just foreign policy but economic policy, anything else. And I think that it creates a real problem in terms of how does he put together a government. LIASSON: Trump himself said last night that it's time for a different kind of campaign. And today, for the first time, the Trump campaign did do two things it's never done before. It produced a stream of rapid response emails during Clinton's economic speech, and Trump sent out his very first email soliciting donations. In spite of all these problems and after weeks of self-inflicted wounds, Trump is still even with Clinton in at least the battleground states of Ohio and Pennsylvania. Tomorrow, in a speech in New York, he will return to the subject Republicans say he has neglected for more than a month. Trump tweeted that he will be discussing the, quote, \"failed policies and bad judgment of crooked Hillary Clinton.\" Mara Liasson, NPR News, Washington. Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.

            "article_content": "Donald Trump met Tuesday afternoon with hundreds of evangelical leaders in New York City for a discussion on various political and moral issues.  AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: The week started off with big questions about Donald Trump's campaign, and they go on, especially now that we know how much money the Trump campaign has in the bank. KELLY MCEVERS, HOST: The latest campaign finance reports came out. Trump has about $1.3 million of cash on hand. Hillary Clinton has $42 million. In a moment, NPR's Mara Liasson will look past that huge gap to see what else Republicans are worried about. CORNISH: First to Manhattan where Donald Trump spent part of the day reaching out to a population that's been vitally important to recent Republican campaigns, evangelical Christians. He met with a large group of evangelical leaders in a closed-door session, and NPR's Sarah McCammon was one of the reporters allowed to sit in on that meeting. She's on the line from New York. And Sarah, what did all those leaders hear from Donald Trump today? SARAH MCCAMMON, BYLINE: Well, you know, before addressing the whole group at this hotel in Times Square in New York, he - Trump met with a smaller group of about 40 leaders or so. I was not in on that meeting, but we do know from a video tweeted by one of the participants, Reverend E.W. Jackson, that Trump wondered aloud about Hillary Clinton's faith. DONALD TRUMP: She's been in the public eye for years and years, and yet there's no - there's nothing out there. MCCAMMON: Now, I should note that Hillary Clinton has been very open about her Methodist faith. Later Trump stressed his love for his family and promised the large group of several hundred evangelicals that he would protect their religious freedom. And he talked about his Supreme Court picks. He's released a list of 11 or so people he says he might choose for Supreme Court justices and promised to release four or five more names soon. CORNISH: Is the makeup of the Supreme Court and the next president's role in nominating justices a top issue for evangelical voters? MCCAMMON: Audie, at this point, it really feels like it is. Many of these evangelicals did not have Donald Trump as their first choice in the primary. But at this point, you know, it's a choice between him and Hillary Clinton in many people's minds or a third party candidate. And do you know what Mark Gonzales told me? He's the head of the evangelical group Hispanic Action Network. He said for him, immigration is still a really big concern about Trump, but, quote, \"we have decided at the end of the day, where the rubber meets the road is the Supreme Court.\" And so he said issues like abortion and same-sex marriage are, you know, the biggest issues for him. CORNISH: And on that issue, Donald Trump has been making overtures to the gay community in his speeches. Is that something that worries this group of evangelicals? MCCAMMON: Yeah, it's a concern I heard today from a lot of them. At one point during the large group discussion, Donald Trump was asked basically for his take on these conscience questions - basically, like, should businesses be required to bake cakes or sell flowers to same-sex weddings if, you know, if they're conservative Christians who disagree with that. And he more or less sidestepped the question other than to say that his judges would be better in those kinds of cases than judges appointed by Hillary Clinton. And that really was the big message today - that it's him versus Hillary Clinton. You know, then at a press briefing later in the day after Trump had left, protesters interrupted a couple of times and stood up and asked some of these evangelical leaders when they would, quote, \"take responsibility for their positions on LGBT issues and linked some of those positions to hate crimes, even the shooting in Orlando.\" CORNISH: And just a few seconds left - the reaction from the room in the end? MCCAMMON: You know, overall fairly positive, but they say it's a continuing conversation with Donald Trump. CORNISH: That's NPR's Sarah McCammon speaking to us from Manhattan. Sarah, thanks so much. MCCAMMON: Thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.  Visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.

Now she is facing off against two rivals who both have support from swaths of the Democratic establishment. And she is hoping the progressive energy she has worked to create can boost her in the close race for the right to challenge freshman Rep. Crescent Hardy, one of the most vulnerable Republicans in the country. Flores' main competitors in the Democratic primary in Nevada's 4th District have their own big boosters. State Senate Minority Whip Ruben Kihuen has the backing of Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., and former President Bill Clinton, while Nevada education leader Susie Lee has been endorsed by EMILY's List, the influential Democratic group that backs pro-abortion-rights women. Flores enjoyed high name ID at the beginning of the contest, thanks to her unsuccessful bid for lieutenant governor two years ago. But the race has predictably tightened. According to Jon Ralston, a longtime political reporter and analyst in the state, the Sanders endorsement has \"helped her immeasurably\" and kept Flores in the game. \"I do think that even though she had the most name recognition going in and she was ahead in early polls, she wouldn't even be in this conversation if it weren't for the mutual embrace between her and Bernie Sanders,\" Ralston said. Flores has leaned heavily on her association with Sanders. She endorsed him early on in his run for the presidency, and he later returned the favor by using his massive fundraising list to help boost her campaign. Flores told NPR in an interview last month that the cash infusion certainly helped her to be able to compete with her opponents, who had deep pockets and powerful Democratic machines behind them. And, she said the unlikely success Sanders had achieved in the Democratic race \u2014 even though he now looks all but certain to fall short in his ultimate goal of the nomination \u2014 has helped her raise progressive issues to the forefront of the contest, including a minimum wage increase, decriminalization of marijuana and Wall Street reform. \"It's not so much that we are all espousing views that all of a sudden became popular,\" she told NPR. \"Those are issues that matter to the everyday person. Now, because of Bernie I think, people are starting to make that connection between those issues and candidates.\" In the fundraising pitch he wrote for Flores, Sanders pointed out her own unique biography. \"Lucy Flores was the first Latina assemblywoman in Nevada and made national news when she became one of the first elected officials to testify about an abortion she had at the age of 16,\" Sanders wrote. A former gang member who found herself in juvenile detention before the age of 15, she eventually turned her life around and became a lawyer. The similarities between the two the Democratic Party power brokers they're both working to defeat wasn't lost on Sanders, either. He argued that, \"Lucy Flores is exactly the kind of person I'm going to need in Congress when I am president. And we can help get her there.\" Flores has also been endorsed by other national progressive groups, such as the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, Democracy for America, NARAL Pro-Choice America and MoveOn.org, all of whom hope that if they can elect more progressive candidates like Flores, the political movement Sanders has helped build will live on regardless of whether he is the Democratic nominee. \"Throughout this campaign, Sen. Sanders has been focused like a laser beam in building progressive power both in the short term and in his presidential campaign,\" said Neil Sroka, spokesman for Democracy for America. \"I think the work that he's doing supporting a lot of the candidates that he's announced so far is a reflection of that focus.\" DFA, Sroka said, has also recommended many candidates to Sanders to endorse and is working to continue to identify like-minded progressives who could benefit from his help. And with the grass-roots training they've done with Sanders volunteers on things like phone banks, knocking on doors and fundraising, they're hopeful that will have a trickle-down effect too. Tuesday's election in Nevada is the first test of whether the renewed progressive fervor Sanders has helped create can have an impact at other levels of the ballot box. But, as Ralston noted, it's also incumbent on the candidates themselves to build up an effective campaign. He said that Flores may not have built a strong enough field program to overcome the advantage the self-funding Lee has and the power of the labor groups that are behind Kihuen, who is probably a slight favorite heading into Tuesday. \"I don't think she was able to leverage the money she raised to its maximum potential,\" Ralston said. Who emerges from this race will have a bearing on how things play out in November, too. Republicans are anxious to face Flores, who they believe is too far to the left to flip the seat. But even then, Hardy \u2014 who represents a district President Obama carried twice and will lean even more Democratic in a presidential year \u2014 is still the underdog. \"There's no doubt that Crescent Hardy's people want Lucy Flores. They think Lucy Flores is their only hope of survival,\" Ralston said. But even if Flores does fall short, there are other progressive hopes to come in contests this summer. Sanders has also endorsed Pramila Jayapal in Washington and Zephyr Teachout in New York. And his most high-profile, high-risk endorsement is Tim Canova, who is trying to oust Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, in Florida, from her congressional seat.",

            "article_content": "Both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are trying to win support from female voters. Yesterday, both presumptive presidential nominees addressed groups that are important for their parties' bases.  SCOTT SIMON, HOST: Both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are trying to win support from women in the coming election. Yesterday the presumptive presidential nominees addressed groups important to their party's bases, and that includes many activists who are women. NPR's Sarah McCammon reports on how their pitches are being received. SARAH MCCAMMON, BYLINE: After becoming the first woman to clinch a major party's presidential nomination, Hillary Clinton focused her first big speech on the issues she's been talking about for decades (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) HILLARY CLINTON: Have you ever noticed that the same politicians who are against sex education, birth control and safe and legal abortion are also against policies that would make it easier to raise a child, like paid family leave? (APPLAUSE, CHEERING) MCCAMMON: Clinton spoke to a supportive audience - members of Planned Parenthood Action Fund in Washington, D.C. She got a warm reception from supporters like Pamela Steed (ph). PAMELA STEED: A woman's ability to control her reproduction is integral to everything. It's integral to women's ability to earn a living and to impact our economy. And so yes, it seems so incredibly fitting that she's standing there on that stage today. MCCAMMON: Across town on another stage, Donald Trump was speaking to members of his party's base, social conservatives, with a promise to protect... (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DONALD TRUMP: The sanctity and dignity of life. (APPLAUSE, CHEERING) MCCAMMON: That means opposing abortion rights, a key concern for many in this audience at the Faith and Freedom Coalition's annual conference. He also promised his potential Supreme Court picks would oppose abortion. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: And by the way, these judges are all pro-life. MCCAMMON: The event was co-hosted by Concerned Women for America. Women as a group tend to lean toward Democrats, and Trump has struggled with favorability ratings among women. But white evangelical women, like most of this audience, have voted heavily Republican. Several told me they'll vote for Trump but only because they don't see a better option. Taylor Smith (ph) is a 20-year-old student at the University of Georgia, and she's disturbed by Trump's tone. TAYLOR SMITH: He's pretty derogatory towards women. He says things that he probably shouldn't say. MCCAMMON: Smith was holding her not-quite-2-year-old son Branson (ph) in her arms and said her experience of an unplanned pregnancy strengthened her opposition to abortion. SMITH: I was a senior in high school when I found out I was pregnant with him, and I had a lot of people pushing me to get an abortion. MCCAMMON: Smith says she's troubled by the fact that Trump once described himself as very pro-choice, but she'd never vote for Clinton. SMITH: I really wish that, you know, Ted Cruz would've gotten the nomination. But obviously he didn't, so I'm just going to have to take what I can get I guess. MCCAMMON: Clinton is campaigning in part on her long-standing support for abortion rights. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CLINTON: When Donald Trump says, let's make America great again, that is code for, let's take America backward. MCCAMMON: Trump did not specifically address women's issues, but at the end of a week where he's been criticized for questioning the fairness of a federal judge based on his Mexican descent, Trump seemed eager to appear magnanimous. He promised to lift up everyone. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: Not a certain group - everyone, the whole country. We're going to lift up. (APPLAUSE) TRUMP: We will make America great again for all Americans. MCCAMMON: With female voters making up more than half of the electorate, both Clinton and Trump will be working to energize women in each party's base in the months to come.

You'd be forgiven for mistaking the beginning of this new ad running in several battleground states for a message from a conservative Christian group. The television ad, called \"Grace,\" opens with a white, Midwestern couple recalling the moment they saw an ultrasound image revealing that their daughter would suffer from the disabling condition spina bifida. The camera pans to pictures of the girl \u2014 whose name is Grace \u2014 as an infant, and later, as a young child in a wheelchair. In the ad, her mother, Lauren Glaros, describes Grace as \"a total blessing in our lives.\" Her father, Chris Glaros, says \"she brings out the goodness in each person.\" In one photo, a cross rests alongside baby Grace's bassinet. There's an emphasis by many conservative, anti-abortion circles on praising parents who choose to carry such pregnancies to term. People with disabilities are mentioned specifically in the mission statement of the National Right to Life, a leading anti-abortion-rights organization, as a group deserving of protection. But this is not an anti-abortion group touting the virtues of giving life to a disabled child. Instead, it's an attack on Donald Trump from the Democratic superPAC Priorities USA Action, which is the main outside political group working to bolster Hillary Clinton. The couple, from Columbus, Ohio, look into the camera and describe their \"shock\" at Trump's actions last November, when he curled his arms close to his body and waved them wildly, appearing to mock a disabled reporter. \"When I saw Donald Trump mock a disabled person, I was just shocked,\" Lauren Glaros says. \"The children at Grace's school all know never to mock her, and so for an adult to mock someone with a disability is shocking.\" Chris Glaros puts his feelings in almost religious terms: \"When I saw Donald Trump mock someone with a disability, it showed me his soul. It showed me his heart.\" Trump later said he was not mocking the reporter's disability, telling supporters at a rally, \"I was very expressive in saying it, and they said that I was mocking him,\" Trump said. \"I would never mock a person that has difficulty. I would never do that. I'm telling you, I would never do it.\" Trump also declined to apologize for the incident, saying he'd been misunderstood and that he deserved an apology. \"Grace\" began running this week in television markets across seven key states: Florida, Ohio, Virginia, Nevada, Colorado, Iowa and New Hampshire. Several of those states, including Virginia, Ohio, Iowa, and Colorado, have substantial conservative Christian populations. Polls suggest that while self-identified evangelicals \u2014 a reliable Republican voting bloc \u2014 have largely supported Trump, those who attend church regularly are less likely to back the real estate mogul. Many are wrestling publicly with how to vote in November. Justin Barasky, a spokesman for Priorities USA Action, said the ad isn't targeting any specific demographic. \"We're speaking to lots of different people \u2014 to anyone who thinks mocking someone with a disability is offensive,\" Barasky said. \"Mocking someone with disability is offensive to evangelicals; it's offensive to agnostics, it's offensive to just about everybody.\" But don't count on this kind of messaging to woo many conservative Christians over to the Democratic side, according to Russell Moore, president of the Southern Baptist Convention's Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission. Moore has been a frequent critic of Trump, recently calling him a \"lost soul\" who needs to \"repent.\" But in a message to NPR, Moore called the Priorities USA ad \"powerful until the very end, when one discovers that it is for Hillary Clinton.\" Moore noted Clinton's support for abortion rights, adding, \"This year, the duopoly on parties have given us two horrible choices when it comes to questions of human dignity.\" But Moore adds that some evangelicals concerned about Trump \u2014 especially younger conservative voters \u2014 plan to vote for Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson, write in another candidate, or skip the top of the ticket. Whether or not these ads persuade voters to cast ballots for the Democratic nominee, they can have another effect. Some political science research suggests that well-timed and well-crafted negative ads may be effective in reducing turnout among would-be supporters of the candidate who is attacked. \"Everything we do is designed to do both. Obviously it's a negative ad, so this is more about defining Trump than turnout amongst Democrats,\" Priorities spokesman Barasky said. \"You can't do one without the other.\" He said they are \"under no illusion that Republicans are going to cross over and vote for Hillary Clinton\" in large numbers. But the superPAC believes that some Republican voters, as well as a substantial number of independents, are \"troubled by the things that Donald Trump has said and done throughout the course of his campaign and his career\" and could be persuaded, at minimum, to abstain from casting a ballot for him. The spot kicks off a $20 million ad buy that will put anti-Trump messages on the air through this summer's Republican National Convention. Barasky said that in the coming weeks, the group's ads will portray Trump as divisive, unqualified to be president, and \"willing to prey on people less fortunate than him,\" as Barasky contended the Trump University fraud lawsuit reveals. The Glaros family, by the way, has some history of political activism for liberal-leaning causes. In 2012, Chris Glaros posted a letter to the Boy Scouts of America on his Facebook page explaining the couple's decision to remove their son from the Scouts in response to the organization's decision to ban gays and lesbians from serving as Scout leaders. That ban was reversed in 2015. Baraksy says the goal of the new ad is simply to tell their story to potential voters. \"I'm sure the ad speaks to different people in different ways. But this is who they are. This is their story,\" Barasky says.",

Renee Ellmers became the first GOP incumbent to lose re-election in Tuesday's primary.\n                \n                    \n                    Travis Long/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption North Carolina Rep. Renee Ellmers became the first GOP incumbent to lose re-election in Tuesday's primary. North Carolina Rep. Renee Ellmers is the first Republican incumbent to lose a primary this year, the victim of heavy conservative spending against her and a new congressional map. Presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump made a late endorsement for Ellmers over the weekend and recorded a robocall to try to save her, but it was too late to make much difference. Instead, Ellmers placed a distant second behind Rep. George Holding and only narrowly edged ahead of a third challenger, physician Greg Brannon. Ellmers was likely doomed from the start. First, mid-decade redistricting ordered by the Supreme Court decimated her original district. She represented less than 20 percent of the newly drawn suburban Raleigh district, while Holding (despite living just outside the new district) had previously represented nearly 60 percent of it. The mortal wound likely came from the $1.1 million that conservative groups spent against her, including well-financed organizations like the Club for Growth and the Koch-backed Americans for Prosperity. First elected in the 2010 GOP wave and seen as a rising Tea Party star, Ellmers rose up the leadership ranks in Washington and became an ally of then-Speaker John Boehner. She voted for budgets that included spending increases, supported raising the debt ceiling and worked to re-authorize the Export-Import Bank that conservative groups believed was akin to corporate welfare. But it wasn't just fiscal conservatives who were upset with her political evolution. Anti-abortion groups also worked to defeat her, saying Ellmers helped derail a 20-week abortion ban, one of their top priorities this Congress. Ellmers and other GOP women had objected to a provision in the bill that would have required women seeking a rape or incest exemption to have reported those rapes to the authorities. The Susan B. Anthony List, which works to elect more anti-abortion women, took the unusual step of endorsing Holding in the race, the first time ever that it had endorsed a man over a \"pro-life woman.\" \"Rep. Renee Ellmers was our ally until she led the charge to derail the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act. That's why we had to flex the political muscle of the pro-life movement,\" SBA List President Marjorie Dannenfelser said in a statement. \"She has her own failed leadership to blame for this loss.\" Those combined conservative forces were eager to make Ellmers an example of what would happen if Republicans moved too far away from party purity. \"The defeat of Renee Ellmers should be a warning to any Republican who campaigns as an economic conservative, but votes for massive spending bills and for corrupt cronyism like the Export-Import Bank,\" Club for Growth Action President David McIntosh added in another statement. Ellmers didn't apologize for those positions, though, or shy away from her record, telling voters at a town hall last week that she wasn't ashamed of the votes she had to make to keep the government functioning and to save jobs in her district. \"I would love for [those bills] to be more conservative, but I'm also a common-sense person,\" Ellmers said. \"I'm a pragmatist. I want to get things done. I'm not going to go to Washington and vote no on everything because some outside special interest group says that's the way that I should vote.\"",

Loretta Sanchez \u2014 a fellow Democrat.\n                \n                    \n                    Richard Vogel/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption California Attorney General Kamala Harris is running for the U.S. Senate, and is expected on Tuesday to advance to the general election against U.S. Rep. Loretta Sanchez \u2014 a fellow Democrat. The presidential race will take top billing on Tuesday, but there are several other important races worth watching, too. Two California Democrats could advance to the general election in the state's open Senate contest. The first GOP incumbent of 2016 will lose in a bitter primary that has pitted conservatives against a former ally. And several primaries could determine how competitive House takeover opportunities are this fall. In addition to the states voting for president, North Carolina and Iowa are also holding congressional primaries. Here's what to watch tonight: Will two Democrats advance in the California Senate race? Thanks to the state's \"jungle primary,\" where the top two vote-getting candidates regardless of party advance to the general election, the race to succeed retiring Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer could feature two Democrats. Attorney General Kamala Harris has long led in polls, with Rep. Loretta Sanchez in second place. Both are expected to outpace a handful of GOP candidates on the ballot. Either candidate would bring added diversity to the Senate if she wins \u2014 Harris would be just the second African-American female senator, while Sanchez would be the first Latina senator (another Hispanic woman is also running in Nevada this year). Harris has emerged as the progressive favorite, with the backing of Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and other liberal groups. But Sanchez is working to appeal to centrist and moderate Republican voters, which could make for a more interesting general election contest, if they both do advance. Can conservatives win an intraparty battle in the North Carolina race? The Tar Heel State is holding special House primaries due to mid-decade redistricting. Those new congressional lines forced two GOP incumbents into a face-off, and conservative groups are taking advantage of the intraparty fight to make an example out of Rep. Renee Ellmers. Both fiscally conservative groups like Americans for Prosperity and the Club for Growth, along with anti-abortion groups such as the Susan B. Anthony List, are upset with votes the three-term congresswoman has made since she was first elected in 2010 with Tea Party support. They've spent more than $1.1 million opposing her re-election bid, looking to boost either fellow Rep. George Holding or physician Greg Brannon. Ellmers already represents less than 20 percent of the new suburban Raleigh district, while the new 2nd District includes almost 60 percent of Holding's old district (even though he lives just outside its new boundaries). So while she was already at a disadvantage to begin with, the massive campaign to defeat her has made her an even bigger underdog, according to state observers. Conservative groups hope an Ellmers loss is a warning shot to other Republicans that if they go to Washington and don't vote in line, that they, too, will face the electoral consequences. But Ellmers argues that her more pragmatic approach has enabled her to be a more effective legislator. Democratic primaries matter for House takeover hopes Democrats already face tough odds of being able to flip the 30 seats they need to win back the House, even with Donald Trump atop the GOP ticket. But if a handful of primary contests don't go their way Tuesday night, that climb could get even harder. In Iowa, freshman Rep. Rod Blum is one of the most vulnerable Republicans in the country after narrowly beating former state House Speaker Pat Murphy in 2014. Murphy wants a rematch, but Monica Vernon, who became the Democrats' nominee for lieutenant governor two years ago after losing the same House primary to Murphy, stands in his way. National Democrats believe Vernon is the stronger candidate to go up against Blum, and she's proven to be the better fundraiser; if she's the nominee, the race probably tilts more in their favor. Keep an eye on California's jungle primary to succeed retiring Democratic Rep. Lois Capps, too. There are nine candidates in the race in the Democratic-leaning Santa Barbara district, but the volatility of such an uncertain race has some Republicans believing that two Republicans could actually finish first and advance to the general election. Prominent Democrats aren't united in who should be their standard-bearer: Capps has endorsed Santa Barbara County Supervisor Salud Carbajal in the race, while Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom has backed Santa Barbara Mayor Helene Schneider. That split has some Republicans optimistic that two Republicans could actually finish first and sneak into the general election, denying Democrats a seat they have to hold on to. The Los Angeles Times also details why it's important to keep an eye on the primaries against California GOP Reps. Jeff Denham, David Valadao and Steve Knight, more seats Democrats are targeting in the fall.",

Renee Ellmers, R-N.C., ahead of her GOP primary on Tuesday. On Tuesday, Renee Ellmers may see her political career cut short by her one-time allies. Six years ago, the North Carolina Republican was a rising star swept into office with the 2010 Tea Party wave. But now conservative groups have her squarely in their cross hairs, arguing she's lost her way since she went to Washington. Upset with her votes on spending and budgets, and on an abortion bill, opponents who once backed her have now spent over $1.1 million trying to defeat her in the state's special primary. Ellmers is fighting for her political life in the special June 7 primary, in part thanks to an unusual mid-decade redistricting. She's facing fellow Rep. George Holding in the redrawn district, along with physician Greg Brannon, who has unsuccessfully run for the GOP Senate nomination twice. Because of the intraparty face-off, at least one incumbent will become the first GOP casualty this year. But will the more pragmatic approach that Ellmers brags about triumph \u2014 or will conservative groups propel one of her rivals to win, claiming victory for conservative orthodoxy? In a town hall last Tuesday in Wake Forest, N.C., Ellmers sounded like a politician on the defensive. She began by explaining to a crowd of about two-dozen people why she'd placed some now-maligned votes that have led to repeated television, radio and direct mail attacks against her record. Yes, she voted for a budget deal that raised spending caps. Yes, she voted for the Export-Import Bank, a government business loan program to U.S. and foreign companies that many conservatives oppose, because it would save jobs in her district. None of those bills were perfect, she argued, but they were necessary to keep the government functioning. \"I would love for [those bills] to be more conservative, but I'm also a common-sense person,\" Ellmers said. \"I'm a pragmatist. I want to get things done. I'm not going to go to Washington and vote no on everything because some outside special interest group says that's the way that I should vote.\" Six years ago, no one would have expected those words to come out of Ellmers' mouth. First elected in the Tea Party wave, she made national news with a blistering ad against Democratic Rep. Bob Etheridge, tying him to President Obama and the idea that the president wanted to build a \"victory mosque\" at Ground Zero in New York. She was one of former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin's original \"Mama Grizzlies.\" And while she was helped by the GOP wave that year and the fact that her opponent was caught on camera berating a Republican tracker, Ellmers seemed primed to be a leading Tea Party voice in Washington. I'm a pragmatist. I want to get things done. I'm not going to go to Washington and vote no on everything because some outside special interest group says that's the way that I should vote. Rep. Renee Ellmers, R-N.C. But when Ellmers got to Washington, she quickly rose up the leadership ranks and became a trusted ally of former Speaker John Boehner. Her voting scorecard from those \"special interest groups\" took a hit as she voted more in line with the GOP establishment. And now, they see a prime chance to take her out. Ellmers admitted in an interview after the town hall that the mosque ad was \"pretty over the top\" (and noted that her consultant who created it is now working for Holding). But she argued that she has stayed true to the original principles she ran on \u2014 smaller government, and replacing and repealing Obamacare \u2014 and that she has been an effective legislator in getting seven bills signed into law, while Holding has only had one since he was elected in 2012. She said these groups are simply singling her out as an easy target to further pad their pockets because they have little to work with while the GOP is in power. \"In order to raise money, you have to have a villain,\" Ellmers told NPR. \" And if you have Republicans that are in the majority in the House, you've got to single people out.\" Over the weekend, she got some help of her own from presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump, whom she endorsed just before North Carolina's March 15 primary. In a robocall for her campaign, Trump said he \"need[s] her help in Washington so we can work together to defeat ISIS, secure our border and bring back jobs and, frankly, so many other things.\" Groups actively working against Ellmers acknowledge that they are making her a target, in part because they want her to be an example of what could happen to other Republicans if they fall out of line. The Koch-backed group Americans for Prosperity (AFP) has spent in the \"low six figures\" against Ellmers, targeting her especially for her support of the Export-Import Bank, which they say was the final straw. Their North Carolina chapter, one of the group's most active, has been running digital ads, sending direct mail, and making thousands of door-to-door visits, targeting high-propensity GOP voters who are most likely to go to the polls in what's expected to be a low-turnout election since it was rescheduled. Donald Bryson, who is AFP's North Carolina state director, said he has personally knocked on 500 to 600 doors and has yet to find someone who is voting for Ellmers. The group hasn't endorsed Holding or Brannon, though this is the first time it has gotten involved in a House GOP primary against an incumbent. \"This is also a warning shot for Washington,\" Bryson told NPR in an interview by the state Capitol. \"Hey, we take corporate welfare very seriously. Conservatives get a knock very often that we're too easy on corporations.\" The Club for Growth is the biggest spender in the district so far, with its political action committee dumping over $700,000 against Ellmers on TV and digital ads calling her \"part of the problem in Washington.\" But it's not just her votes on fiscal issues that have angered conservative groups. The Susan B. Anthony List, whose goal is to elect more anti-abortion women to Congress, took the unusual step of endorsing Holding over Ellmers \u2014 the first time they've ever endorsed a man over a \"pro-life woman.\" That's because they say Ellmers helped derail one of their top priorities this Congress \u2014 a 20-week abortion ban, known as the \"Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act.\" Ellmers and other GOP women and some moderate members had objected to a provision in the bill that would have required women seeking a rape or incest exemption to have reported those rapes to the authorities. Ellmers, a former nurse, argued it was an undue burden and would have hurt the GOP, which was already trying to rebound from an election year when several Republican male candidates were under fire for the way they talked about rape. She points out she still has a perfect record with the National Right to Life, though it and the Susan B. Anthony List are now opposing her. The groups say her actions on the bill she once championed were unforgivable and caused their important legislative goal to lose steam. SBA List is also waging a field program and running digital ads against Ellmers, whom they'd previously endorsed. Jason Kirkman and Emily Webster, canvassers for the anti-abortion group, were knocking on doors in a suburban Apex, N.C., neighborhood last Tuesday afternoon. Many people weren't home midday Tuesday, but the duo said that at the many houses where they have been able to talk to people over time, the vast majority didn't know of her actions on the bill, which made them less likely to vote for her. Placards that the two leave on doors for voters not home proclaim that \"we cannot trust Renee Ellmers to protect the unborn\" and that her actions had \"betrayed the unborn children who die from painful abortions every day.\" If Ellmers does go down on Tuesday, these outside groups will claim her loss as a victory for conservative purity. But the truth is, it's possible Ellmers may have been doomed from the start. Ellmers previously represented less than 20 percent of the new district, looking at it post-court-ordered redistricting, though parts of it were in her pre-2012 district. Holding, however, previously represented almost 60 percent of the new 2nd District, even though his home is just outside its current boundaries. But according to Steven Greene, a political science professor at North Carolina State University, the simple dynamics that began by favoring Holding shouldn't be discounted. And given the heavy investment from conservative groups who are anxious to make Ellmers an example, her fate may already be sealed. \"She's someone who got to Washington and realized she wanted to get things done,\" Greene said of her seeming evolution over the past six years. \"And that's not a popular thing in the GOP.\" While there's been no reliable public polling of the race, Greene said Ellmers should be seen as the underdog, and he said he believes the ground games from these groups against Ellmers, especially, will make a big difference. Her one chance could be if both Holding and Brannon split the anti-Ellmers vote and she is able to escape with a plurality of the vote. But if she doesn't survive, the \"example\" that conservative groups want to make of her could lead to even more polarization in Congress, if they wage similar campaigns against incumbents who don't fall in line. \"When you take compromise off the table, that's not good for American democracy,\" Greene said.",

            "article_content": "After holding back his support, House Speaker Paul Ryan now says he will vote for the presumptive GOP nominee for president, Donald Trump.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: It took a while, but House Speaker Paul Ryan has now endorsed Donald Trump for president. The leader of the Republican-controlled House has struggled to get there since Trump cleared the path to the nomination. In a column published today in his hometown paper, the Janesville Gazette, Ryan says he will vote for Donald Trump this November. NPR congressional reporter Susan Davis joins us now. Hi, Sue. SUSAN DAVIS, BYLINE: Hey, Ari. SHAPIRO: So why now? DAVIS: Well, it - politically, it did not hurt that the endorsement came right in the middle of a Hillary Clinton speech attacking Donald Trump over national security. While that was good timing, it also helps House Republicans get in front of next week what Paul Ryan is kicking off, a three-week agenda project, that House Republicans are going to outline the things they will do if a Republican president wins in November. And it is his way of asserting House Republicans' role in deciding what the Republican Party is going to be about this fall. It's going to give his lawmakers something to run on. And it does what he said he would do it - when he became speaker is he wants the Republican Party to become a proposition party that tells voters what they're going to do and not just a party that tells voters what they oppose. SHAPIRO: Now, as we said, Paul Ryan was not early out of the gate in endorsing Trump. Did he say what persuaded him? DAVIS: You know, the two men had a very hyped meeting in D.C. last month, where they met privately at the RNC. Both have said that their aides have been in private conversations in recent weeks talking about what common ground they could find. In his op-ed, Ryan said that they've talked - in his words - at great length about ideas. And he specifically said that the things that they could agree on - there was two things in particular he called out - was that they both oppose abortion rights and that Trump putting out his list of conservatives that he would put on the court was an encouraging sign for him. And in it he said he has confidence in Trump and that he will vote for him this November. SHAPIRO: But still some disagreements between the two of them? DAVIS: You know, as Ryan often says they represent the two wings of the Republican Party, and on nearly every major issue, particularly on economic issues, they have significant disagreements. They disagree over whether or not to raise the minimum wage. They disagree over whether or not wealthy Americans should pay more in taxes. And they certainly disagree over what to do over entitlements. The question now is when House Republicans roll out this agenda, how much of this is Donald Trump going to embrace and campaign on? As he has indicated throughout this campaign, he does not necessarily feel like he's the one that needs to change. SHAPIRO: And what about the possible impact on House races? Do you expect House members to campaign with or independent of Trump? How is this going to work? DAVIS: You know, now that every major congressional leader has endorsed Trump, it's going to be very hard to make the case that there's any daylight between the top of the ticket and the bottom of the ticket. So the Republican Party is firmly lined up behind Trump. What we know from the numbers is right now there's just not that many competitive races in play in the House. Republicans are favored to hold onto that majority. Nonpartisan election forecasters say the Democrats are likely to pick up seats, but the kind of wave they need for a takeover still seems out of sight. SHAPIRO: NPR congressional reporter Sue Davis.

Warren/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Likely Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump speaks during a rally in Eugene, Ore. Donald Trump released a list of 11 judges Wednesday he said he would consider for nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court if elected president. The move was seen as an effort to assuage Republican suspicions that he would not choose genuine conservatives to fill Supreme Court vacancies, one of which exists right now. Trump did not pledge to name any of the 11 judges on the list to the Supreme Court seat of the late justice Antonin Scalia. Instead, he said he planned to use it as a \"guide\" for filling not just the Scalia seat but potentially as many as three other seats that could realistically come open during the next president's tenure. Three of the current justices are in their late 70s and early 80s. The list proved Trump's media mastery once again. He got the headlines, but he did not commit to actually naming any of the judges on the list to the nation's highest court. Reaction was predictably polarized. Progressive groups call the judges on the list \"extremists.\" Nan Aron, president of the liberal Alliance for Justice, said the list included \"some of the most extreme conservatives on the federal bench today,\" judges who, if named to the high court, would do \"terrible damage to liberties and protections most Americans now take for granted.\" Ilyse Hogue, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, called the list \"a woman's worst nightmare.\" White House Press Secretary Josh Ernest said, \"I would be surprised if there are any Democrats who would describe those individuals as 'consensus nominees,'\" the words Republicans once used to describe President Obama's nominee to the court \u2014 Merrick Garland. The Garland nomination has been in limbo for months now, because Senate Republicans have refused to hold a hearing on it. In contrast, conservative activists and Senate Republicans welcomed the Trump list warmly. Carrie Severino, of the conservative Judicial Crisis Network, said the judges on the list \"share in common a record of putting the law and the Constitution ahead of their political preferences.\" Sen. Charles Grassley, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, expressed admiration for some on the list. The Trump list includes six federal judges, all very conservative jurists appointed to federal appeals courts by President George W. Bush, and five conservative state Supreme Court justices. The federal judges are: Steven Colloton of Iowa, Raymond Gruender of Missouri, Thomas Hardiman of Pennsylvania, Raymond Kathledge of Michigan, William Pryor of Alabama, and Diane Sykes of Wisconsin. The five state Supreme Court justices are: Alison Eid of Colorado, Joan Larsen of Michigan, Thomas Lee of Utah, David Stras of Minnesota, and Don Willet of Texas. What is surprising about the list are the names not on it. Among them: Brett Kavanaugh, a very conservative and respected judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, the court that Scalia served on before being elevated to the Supreme Court; Judge Jeffrey Sutton, a beloved former Scalia clerk, now a highly respected conservative judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, based in Cincinnati. (Sutton was the author of two controversial opinions, one in which he upheld Obamacare based on previous Supreme Court rulings, and the other, upholding same-sex marriage laws.); Lastly, not on the list is Paul Clement, who served as the Bush administration's chief advocate in the Supreme Court and who has become the go-to lawyer for conservative causes in the High Court \u2014 causes ranging from the attack on Obamacare to the attack on the federal birth-control mandate because of religious objections. For the most part, the names that are on the Trump list are not household names, not even in legal households. Some were controversial when they were nominated to the federal appeals courts they now serve on. For example, William Pryor at his confirmation hearing said he personally viewed Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court's 1973 abortion decision as \"the worst abomination in the history of Constitutional law.\" He also drew both praise and opprobrium when, as state attorney general, he helped force Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore off the state Supreme Court after Moore refused to obey a court order to remove from the courthouse a monument to the Ten Commandments. Not all the names on the list are Trump supporters, either. Judges, of course, are not supposed to publicly support any political candidates. That said, Judge Diane Sykes, a federal appeals court judge from the Midwest, was previously married to Wisconsin conservative talk show host Charlie Sykes, famous for his opposition to Trump, #NeverTrump. Diane would be an outstanding choice. Would make a great justice. But I simple don't believe Trump... https://t.co/v0mG9HqylL And Texas Supreme Court Justice Don Willet, an inveterate tweeter, has mocked the presumptive GOP nominee, on Twitter. For example, he tweeted, \"We will rebuild the Death Star. It'll be amazing. Believe me, and the rebels will pay for it,\" a riff on Trump's pledge to build a wall and have Mexico pay for it. \"We'll rebuild the Death Star. It'll be amazing, believe me.

Tammy Duckworth is running against Illinois Republican Sen. Mark Kirk. If Democrats take back the Senate in 2016, they'll likely have women to thank for it. The party is likely to have at least six female nominees who are challenging Republican incumbents in their top-targeted states, helping them flip the four seats necessary to take back Senate control, if Democrats hold the White House. And Democrats believe they have the perfect storm brewing to help them do that \u2014 likely the first female presidential nominee coupled with a probable GOP nominee who has a well-documented history of controversial remarks about women. \"With Donald Trump's toxicity permeating the Republican Party, never has there been a better time for a slate of Democratic women who remain focused on issues rather than insults,\" said Marcy Stech of EMILY's List, whose group helps recruit pro-abortion rights women to run for political office. And if women win in these top-targeted races, they're on pace to break the current record of 20 women in the Senate. If Democrats run the table, women could make up nearly a quarter of the upper chamber come January 2017. Women headline top 2016 Senate races In all, Democrats could have nine female Senate nominees; Republicans have two female incumbents running for re-election, New Hampshire's Kelly Ayotte and Alaska's Lisa Murkowski. Two current female Democratic senators are retiring this year \u2014 California's Barbara Boxer and Maryland's Barbara Mikulski. Boxer is likely to be replaced by a woman (Attorney Gen. Kamala Harris leads Rep. Loretta Sanchez in polls). But they'll be down at least one after Rep. Chris Van Hollen defeated Rep. Donna Edwards in the Maryland Democratic primary last month. 2016 could see a record number of women elected to the Senate.\n                \n                    \n                    Jessica Taylor/Vital Statistics, Brookings Institution\n                    \n                \nhide caption One marquee general election race will be won by a woman either way \u2014 Ayotte is being challenged by Democratic Gov. Maggie Hassan. And in many of the Democrats' top Senate targets, they already have or are likely to get women as nominees: Rep. Tammy Duckworth in Illinois, former state environmental chief Katie McGinty in Pennsylvania, former Attorney General Catherine Cortez Masto in Nevada, former state Rep. Deborah Ross in North Carolina, and Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick in Arizona. Iowa isn't yet a top target, but could become more competitive; the national party has endorsed former Lt. Gov. Patty Judge in the Democratic primary to try to unseat GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley. How big will the 2016 gender gap be? Presidential years are typically good boosts for women seeking office anyway, given the more favorable dynamics for Democrats \u2014 more female voters turning out, more minorities and younger voters. Democrats have had more success at recruiting women to run overall too, given the typical demographics of their party. And Republicans haven't yet been able to replicate pipeline programs like EMILY's List to recruit women and have a deep bench in lower offices to draw from. \"Any good year for Democrats tends to be a good year for women,\" said Jennifer Lawless, director of American University's Women & Politics Institute. In the last presidential election, women made up over half of the electorate, and President Obama carried that bloc by 11 points. That cycle, Democrats also added to their Senate majority, and Republicans lost several winnable races after Missouri GOP nominee Todd Akin, when asked about abortion restrictions, made a comment that women rarely got pregnant by \"legitimate rape.\" After that, Republicans realized they had to talk to and about women more. Campaign committees trained male candidates on how to talk to their female opponents, and Republicans made efforts to recruit more women to run. Their efforts paid off, and in 2014, two more GOP women were elected as Republicans took control of the Senate. They were also able to push back on the Democratic argument that Republicans are carrying out a \"war on women\" \u2014 a message pushed hard by Sen. Mark Udall, who lost his 2014 re-election bid in Colorado to Republican Cory Gardner. After 2014 success, the \"war on women\" re-emerges But those efforts have been derailed by Trump. Earlier this year, the National Republican Senatorial Committee admitted in a leaked private memo to candidates and campaigns that Trump's rhetoric was a headache. \"Houston, we have a problem: Donald Trump has said some wacky things about women,\" wrote NRSC executive director Ward Baker. \"Candidates shouldn't go near this ground other than to say that your wife or daughter is offended by what Trump said. We do not want to reengage the 'war on women' fight so isolate Trump by offering a quick condemnation of it.\" But now, with the reality that Trump will be their party's nominee, it's becoming harder for candidates to distance themselves from him. Not all vulnerable incumbents have said they will endorse him for president, but not one has said they won't. Ayotte, in fact, tried to saddle the fence by saying she supports Trump as the GOP nominee but won't endorse him. There's no question that Trump has a woman problem \u2014 a Gallup poll last month showed that 70 percent of women have an unfavorable opinion of Trump. And the fear that he would alienate even more women in the general election was a main argument of anti-Trump groups in the primary, with one group running an ad that had women reading the insults that Trump had hurled at women in the past: \"Bimbo. Dog. Fat pig.\" And a New York Times story over the weekend explored Trump's \"unwelcome advances, a shrewd reliance on ambition, and unsettling workplace conduct over decades\" toward women. Gender becoming a driving issue in 2016 De facto GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump has already accused likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton of \"playing the woman's card.\" \"Frankly, if Hillary Clinton were a man, I don't think she'd get 5 percent of the vote,\" he said last month. Clinton's campaign has capitalized on that, even selling official \"Woman Cards\" on her website. \"If fighting for women's health care and paid family leave and equal pay is playing the woman card, then deal me in,\" she has said on the campaign trail. Democrats have worked to tie those comments to down-ballot races, too. An EMILY's List statement after Trump's comments hit GOP male incumbents over his \"strategy to marginalize women by claiming that women voters only support women candidates because they are women.\" \"There are more women now for whom that concern [of electing a woman president] is maybe salient,\" she said. \"And the notion of competing against Donald Trump, who in some ways is the complete antithesis of progress for women, might make the issue more salient for voters.\" Deborah Ross, a Democrat who's challenging Republican Sen. Richard Burr in North Carolina, said the GOP nominee's comments about women would hurt him in that swing state \u2014 and she plans to make them hurt her opponent. North Carolina Democratic Senate candidate Deborah Ross responds to a question during a live televised debate.\n                \n                    \n                    Gerry Broome/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption North Carolina Democratic Senate candidate Deborah Ross responds to a question during a live televised debate. \"The comments that Mr. Trump has come out with are not going to be helpful to him with women, but I really firmly believe that Burr's record won't be either, because it's in black and white,\" Ross said, pointing to his votes to de-fund Planned Parenthood and to scuttle paycheck fairness legislation. Republicans argue that Clinton has plenty of weaknesses, too, including her own high negative ratings on favorability and trustworthiness. \"There is a reason Democrat candidates aren't lining up to campaign with Hillary Clinton. She is a toxic candidate whose failed leadership has put the security of our country at risk,\" said NRSC spokeswoman Andrea Bozek. Nonetheless, Clinton still holds a narrowly positive favorability rating among women, and head-to-head matchups so far have shown she wins women in a general election by nearly 20 points. It's no guarantee that a majority of female voters will elect a female candidate. For example, earlier this year Edwards lost to Van Hollen despite women making up the majority of the primary electorate. And Lawless, the American University professor, said that it's yet to be determined how much Clinton could be a motivating factor on more women turning out, but that Clinton is embracing the historic nature of her candidacy in a way that she didn't until it was too late in her 2008 primary with Obama. There's also hope that a Senate with more women could possibly lead to more congeniality in a notoriously divided Congress. A bipartisan group of women in the Senate meet regularly for supper, and during the 2013 government shutdown, it was Republican women who worked with their Democratic colleagues to broker a deal. But to the women running this year, the historic nature of this election isn't lost on them either \u2014 not just the possibility of the first female president, but a potentially historic percentage of women in the Senate as well. \"I think it will be fabulous for this country to have more perspectives,\" said Ross, the Senate candidate in North Carolina. \"But remember, 25 percent still doesn't represent the 50 percent of the population. We have to start somewhere, but I think there's always going to be room to grow.\"",

He also stressed that his endorsement was not intended to sway the votes of Indiana Republicans. \"I respect the right of every Hoosier in making their determination,\" Pence said, adding, \"I encourage everyone to make up their own mind.\" In fact, Pence mentioned Trump before mentioning his endorsement of Cruz. \"I like and respect all three of the candidates,\" Pence began. \"I particularly want to commend Donald Trump,\" whom he said has given voice to people's frustrations. He said he was \"grateful\" for Trump at least twice \u2014 for taking a stand for Hoosier jobs. And \"for his voice in the national debate. I'm not against anybody, but I will be voting for Ted Cruz in the Republican primary.\" And, he added, \"Let me be very, very clear on this ... whoever wins the Republican nomination I'm going to work my heart out for this fall.\" Pence's endorsement was closely watched, in part, because he'll be on the ballot this fall as a candidate for re-election, and because, in the past, he's been seen as a possible Republican presidential candidate. Cruz also hopes Pence's endorsement gives him a boost in the Hoosier State, where he's trailing Trump in recent surveys. Cruz was helped by Scott Walker's endorsement in Wisconsin, giving Cruz his only big-state primary victory so far in this campaign. But Cruz not only had Walker's endorsement, but almost the entire GOP infrastructure in Wisconsin, including talk radio. Pence's endorsement was far less forceful than Cruz would probably have liked. There are 57 delegates at stake in Indiana on Tuesday. If Trump sweeps those delegates, his path to the nomination not only becomes clear, but likely. Currently, he needs 42 percent of remaining delegates to win, which is very doable. If he wins all of Indiana's 57 delegates, that drops to 36 percent.",

            "article_content": "Washington, D.C., gets a close-up view of political money excesses next door in the Maryland elections, which include a millionaire self-financing his campaign and a candidate's spouse running a superPAC.  AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: Presidential campaigns have been throwing money into tomorrow's Maryland primaries. And for such a small state, there's plenty of cash, and House and Senate races too, including super PACs putting ads on TV. One House candidate in the state is spending more personal cash than any other federal candidate nationwide - oh, except for Donald Trump. NPR's Peter Overby has more. PETER OVERBY, BYLINE: That second-only-to-Trump candidate is businessman David Trone, a Democrat and obviously a millionaire. He's given his campaign nearly $13 million so far for a budget more than five times as large as his closest rival. Like Donald Trump, David Trone presents his personal wealth as a virtue. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DAVID TRONE: There's a reason I'm not taking a cent from PACs, lobbyists and corporations. I'd rather spend my own money than owe anything to them. This commercial is bought and paid for. I won't be. OVERBY: The contest is in the 8th District, a Democratic stronghold bordering Washington, D.C. Two other candidates might have the cash to compete with Trone. Both attacked big money. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KATHLEEN MATTHEWS: In the race for Congress, I don't believe that big money can buy votes, not in our district. OVERBY: This ad is from Kathleen Matthews, a former D.C. news anchor and business executive. Her husband is MSNBC host Chris Matthews. She's put half a million dollars into her campaign which now has about $2.6 million. State Senator Jamie Raskin has raised about $2 million. He's a longtime advocate of restricting political money, as this campaign video points out. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: Because my vote is earned, not bought. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: Because grassroots power can stop big money. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: Because Jamie has always been progressive. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: Because, literally, Jamie Raskin wrote the book on campaign finance reform. OVERBY: David Lublin is a political scientist at American University. He also writes the Seventh State blog about Maryland politics. He lives in Montgomery County, the liberal heart of the district. He said this primary is ironic. DAVID LUBLIN: Montgomery County has always prided itself so much on being this good government county, very ethical and very reformist. And yet our congressional race is setting new records for money. OVERBY: And that's made money a campaign issue. LUBLIN: The disagreements on issues are often relatively small, and so money's so important because it's all about getting known and getting known in a positive way. OVERBY: The Democrat Senate primary isn't nearly as positive, and a lot of that is due to super PACs. Its Maryland's first open-seat Senate race in a decade. Congressman Chris Van Hollen is giving up the 8th District seat for this. He faces Congresswoman Donna Edwards from the district next door. His campaign is outspending hers, but super PACs have spent five and a half million dollars so far, and 70 percent of that is on Edwards' side. One pro-Edwards ad tried to pull President Obama into the debate. It's from a super PAC called Working for Us, funded mainly by a branch of the pro-women abortion rights group Emily's List. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #3: The NRA and its campaign cash are what stands between us and gun reform. BARACK OBAMA: Every time I think about those kids, it gets me mad. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #3: Chris Van Hollen met with NRA lobbyists to craft a loophole that would let the NRA... OVERBY: Working for Us had to edit Obama out of the spot when the White House complained. Among the pro-Van Hollen super PACs is the Committee for Maryland's Progress, which is funded mostly by two unions. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #4: We need a senator who does more than talk, but Donna Edwards was ranked one of the least effective members of Congress. OVERBY: All of these Democratic candidates are on record for reducing the flow of political money, but that's on hold right now as they push forward to primary day.

Donald Trump wants the Republicans to alter the party platform on a fundamental issue for many conservative activists \u2014 abortion. The GOP platform, which is formally adopted at the Republican National Convention, has included language every election year since 1984 with support for a human life amendment to the Constitution and a call for \"legislation to make it clear that the Fourteenth Amendment's protections apply to unborn children.\" (The 14th Amendment says no state shall \"deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\") When Trump appeared in a town hall segment on NBC's Today Show Thursday morning, host Savannah Guthrie asked about that language: \"The Republican platform, every four years, has a provision that states that the right of the unborn child shall not be infringed. And it makes no exceptions for rape, for incest, for the life of the mother. Would you want to change the Republican platform to include the exceptions that you have?\" \"Yes I would. Yes I would. Absolutely,\" Trump responded. \"For the three exceptions, I would.\" The question comes about three weeks after Trump angered abortion-rights opponents and advocates alike by telling MSNBC's Chris Matthews that a woman seeking an abortion would have to face \"some form of punishment\" if the procedure were ever made illegal in any state. Trump quickly backtracked from that statement, issuing multiple clarifications in the aftermath of the interview. The Republican platform adopted in 2012 states: \"We affirm our moral obligation to assist, rather than penalize, women challenged by an unplanned pregnancy.\" Trump has campaigned this year as an abortion-rights opponent. He held different views before entering the political realm, though. In yet another NBC appearance \u2014 an interview by Tim Russert in 1999 used in an attack ad from Ted Cruz \u2014 Trump said, \"I'm very pro-choice.\"",

            "article_content": "With Donald Trump dominating the GOP presidential race, moderate Republican voters are left without a strong option on the ballot. Many are backing John Kasich in next week's Pennsylvania primary.  ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: Donald Trump has sidelined many establishment Republican candidates in this year's race. And that is leaving many mainstream GOP voters feeling left out as the party approaches the end of its nomination process. NPR's Don Gonyea is also in Pennsylvania, listening to how those voters are viewing the road ahead. DON GONYEA, BYLINE: With the Pennsylvania primary up next, there are lively political events everywhere this week, like last night's Philadelphia Republican Committee Spring Mixer, where the DJ pulled out a microphone and crooned an old Bobby Darin classic over the din of the crowd, Karaoke style. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED DJ: (Singing) Somewhere beyond the sea, she's there watching for me. GONYEA: The chatter slowly died down when speeches began. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Well, first off, I want to welcome everybody to South Philadelphia. GONYEA: The three Republican presidential campaigns were invited to send surrogates to speak. Carly Fiorina was there for Ted Cruz. There was no one representing the Trump campaign, even though he had plenty of supporters here. And for Ohio Gov. John Kasich, it was former Pennsylvania Congressman Bob Walker. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BOB WALKER: And what matters this year is not who can win the primary, but who can win in the fall. We cannot afford to have Hillary Clinton become president of the United States. GONYEA: Talk to a Kasich supporter here, and it's not unusual for them to tell you who they like before they started backing the Ohio governor. MELISSA ANDERSON: I had been a Romney supporter. When I realized he was not going to run again, I thought, I need to find someone to support. GONYEA: That's 34-year-old attorney and lifelong Republican Melissa Anderson. ANDERSON: And I chose Gov. Kasich because I thought he has the experience to lead, and he's the one who can actually win in a general election. GONYEA: That's a point Kasich supporters, like Congressman Walker and Anderson, drive home again and again when talking to a reporter or trying to persuade their friends - that polls show Kasich is the general election candidate who scares the Democrats. You hear something else from his backers, too. Here's 35-year-old Alyssa Prichep. ALYSSA PRICHEP: I could never see myself supporting Trump. GONYEA: She says she's a fiscal conservative who supports same-sex marriage and abortion rights, and she simply cannot tolerate how she thinks Donald Trump marginalizes so many different groups of people. PRICHEP: Women, Muslims, immigrants, any kind of minority, I think, across the board. When you're condemning and putting down one group of people based on how they're born, their basic identity, just because of who they are, then you will do that to anybody. GONYEA: Prichep says she knows John Kasich is a long-shot, but she says a vote for him now can keep his campaign alive. Then, she hopes - really hopes - that a deadlocked Republican convention will finally see him as its best option. I ask her, what if Trump is the nominee? After a long pause, she says she'd probably consider voting for Hillary Clinton, but the mere thought of that clearly makes her very uncomfortable. Now, out to the Philadelphia suburbs, a place with plenty of swing voters. Sixty-three-year-old attorney Ray Falzone says he likes establishment Republicans like Mitt Romney and John McCain. So what about Kasich this year? RAY FALZONE: I'm kind of disappointed that he didn't have a better showing up to this point because I think he's more of a presidential-type material, levelheaded. He's got a track record. GONYEA: Then, he adds this. FALZONE: I also see his chance as being slim and none, so it's like - I feel like I'm sort of wasting a vote if I vote for him, although he would be my number one pick, frankly, if he was in a better position. GONYEA: Falzone says he won't vote Trump, so right now, he's leaning Cruz as the lesser of two evils. Now, it's not unusual for voters to be frustrated with their options in an election year like this, but it is unusual for mainstream Republicans to find themselves stuck with such a hard choice.

It's essentially impossible to win the Democratic nomination without support from women. In primaries and caucuses across the country, women make up a solid majority of the Democratic electorate. In fact, according to exit poll data, there's not a state that's voted to date where women made up less than 54 percent of Democratic voters. And, in Mississippi, women made up nearly two-thirds (64 percent) of Democratic primary voters. Women, of course, like any demographic, are not a monolith. Hillary Clinton consistently loses young women (ages 18 to 29) to Bernie Sanders. But, accounting for women of all different groups, Clinton has a clear advantage. There aren't exit polls for every single state, but the common thread from all the data from the exit polls conducted to date show women, as a bloc, are supporting Clinton over Sanders. (Young women don't vote as regularly. And Clinton performs best with older women, who are far more loyal voters.) There are a few exceptions: New Hampshire \u2014 where Sanders dominated essentially every demographic; Vermont \u2014 Sanders' home turf, where he won women by more than 60 points; and Wisconsin \u2014 where Sanders and Clinton essentially broke even with women. There could be more exceptions as the primary season continues, but, for now, exit-poll analyses suggest Clinton has a safety net, and it's essentially a web of women. What Do Women Want? NPR interviewed dozens of women in different states about Clinton. Some said they identify with her, because she's a woman. Others said they support the former secretary of state because of her experience and intelligence. But almost everyone at some point in the conversation, whether or not they were committed to voting for Clinton, mentioned they like her, because she understands \"women's issues.\" This term \u2014 \"women's issues\" is vague and has a different definition depending on who's using it. For Angel Suit, a single mom in South Carolina who gets up before dawn to deliver newspapers for minimum wage, women's issues revolve around the economy. \"We need better-paying jobs,\" she said, as she tried to quiet her 1-year-old son. \"That's one of my biggest issues, especially the minimum wage in South Carolina.\" Other women pointed to equal pay and paid family leave. \"Women are interested in kitchen-table issues \u2014 jobs, retirement, education, health \u2014 all the things that we need to do to raise a family and take care of elders,\" said Mary Metz, a retired professor, as she was about to enter a Clinton event on the campus of the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Metz said women like herself have complex concerns \u2014 both domestic and international. \"[Women] are also interested in foreign relations, but they're interested in not having a lot of wars, trying to work things out,\" she explained. Why do women like Clinton? For some women, the allure of voting for Clinton is a matter of simple identity politics. \"I identify with her immensely; you know, she's a woman; I'm a woman,\" said Chantel Moses, an entrepreneur in New York. \"There's a lot of tasks that's associated with being a woman \u2014 multi-tasking, making sure that you're not only able to have a career, but also to provide for your family.\" Moses wants a woman lead the country, but she also wants to ensure a \"competent\" woman is in charge, she explained. Most women NPR interviewed insist they're supporting Clinton for multiple reasons beyond identity politics. \"My choice of candidates on the Democratic Party is less to do with my gender and her gender and more to do with the politics,\" Liz Yuhas, 27, said. But, Yuhas, like many women, admitted that electing the first woman president is in the back of her mind, even if it's not the determining factor. \"I think it's cool,\" she said. \"And, I think her belief in gender equality is more tangible because of [her gender.] For some older voters, gender is more central. \"Look at the assault on reproductive rights,\" said Mary Strickland, 61, a Clinton supporter who works in investments. She added, \"Some of the issues we fought for many years are being eroded. ... I work in a very non-traditional field. And, I do feel that women carry the water for women's issues whether it be reproductive rights, whether it be employment programs for women, whether it be daycare funding. ... We should have daycare provided for families throughout the United States.\" Clinton plays the \"gender card\" In her 2008 campaign, Clinton struggled to talk about gender. Some critics claimed she \"ran as a man.\" But, in the 2016 campaign, she often discusses women on the stump, as she did Tuesday on a panel about pay equity organized by Glassdoor, a company that collects data on employee salaries. \"Now, occasionally when I give a speech like this, which I do practically every day,\" Clinton said, \"people will say, 'Oh there she goes, she's playing the gender card.' And what I say to that is if talking about equal pay and paid leave and more opportunities for women and girls is playing the gender card, then deal me in.\" For Clinton, women are not just key in the primary, they could be crucial in a general election. Democrats already have a built-in advantage with unmarried women. (NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben has written more about the growing power of single women in politics.) But, Democratic pollster Anna Greenberg said there's another group of highly coveted women \u2014 independents, who do not identify with either major political party. \"Independent women tend to be one of the most important, persuadable blocs in the electorate,\" Greenberg said. \"They sort of are the holy grail of general elections. ... They also tend to be a little more socially liberal and a little more economically conservative.\" And socially liberal women tend to have more liberal attitudes about abortion \u2014 an issue that's come to the forefront recently in the GOP campaign because of comments from Donald Trump. In most states where exit polling is available, men have voted for Hillary Clinton at about the same rate as Bernie Sanders. States where Clinton won the overall vote are bolded.\n                \n                    \n                    Asma Khalid and Meg Kelly/Exit Polls\n                    \n                \nhide caption \"The reason we have trouble talking to women voters is that many women voters believe Republican voters are wrong on specific women's reproductive issues \u2014 and that's a challenge,\" said Republican strategist Lisa Camooso Miller. \"I think now more than ever the Republican Party is in a deficit because of the words and the actions Donald Trump has taken in the primary.\" But, it's not just words, it's also tone, continued Camooso-Miller. \"That back and forth between the candidates,\" she said, \"whether it's Donald Trump or anyone else, is really unattractive and unappealing to women, because we are looking for ... candidates that are coming up with solutions, talking about the issues rather than sparring with one another back-and-forth, sometimes even to the detriment of the other candidates' spouses.\" She said most voters \u2014 women or men \u2014 are concerned about homeland security and the economy, and Republican candidates need to figure out a way to pivot back to that conversation. Polls show Donald Trump has a 70 percent unfavorable rating among women. And, Camooso Miller is worried Trump is repelling women at the same time Clinton is trying to court them. If the current trajectory continues, Clinton could turn the traditional gender gap into a gender gulf in November. But, of course, she has to secure the Democratic nomination first. And, for now, she has a challenge \u2014 the other end of the gender spectrum \u2014 men. Exit polls show Clinton has had a rockier record winning male voters, especially white men. In Wisconsin, for example, Sanders won men resoundingly beating Clinton by about 30 points.",

Ted Cruz of Texas at a Milwaukee victory rally Tuesday night, celebrating his win in the Wisconsin primary. Ted Cruz has made no secret of his dislike of what he calls \"New York values.\" But now Cruz needs the support of New York voters if he is to stop Donald Trump from winning the Republican presidential nomination. It's only been a few months since the Texas senator went after Trump with a campaign ad highlighting the billionaire's past support for abortion rights \u2014 aimed at casting doubt on Trump's conservative bona fides. The ad was launched ahead of the Iowa caucuses and included an archival clip of Trump saying he'd lived in New York City all his life, \"So, you know, my views are a little bit different than if I lived in Iowa.\" The ad's narrator concluded: \"Donald Trump. New York values. Not ours.\" That sparked an outcry from New Yorkers. It was even suggested that Cruz's comment was meant as an anti-Semitic dog whistle. During a debate in South Carolina in January, Cruz defended the ad. He said that there are \"wonderful working men and women in the state of New York, but everyone understands that the values in New York City are socially liberal, are pro-abortion, are pro-gay marriage, focus around money and the media.\" In one of his biggest debate moments of the campaign, Trump fired back, calling New York a \"great place\" with \"loving people, wonderful people.\" And then, Trump invoked Sept. 11: \"When the World Trade Center came down, I saw something that no place on Earth could have handled more beautifully, more humanely than New York. You had two 110-story buildings come crashing down, I saw them come down, thousands of people killed, and the cleanup started the next day, and it was the most horrific cleanup, probably in the history of doing this, and in construction, I was down there. And I've never seen anything like it. And the people in New York fought, and fought, and fought, and we saw more death and even the smell of death, nobody understood it, and it was with us for months, the smell. The air. And we rebuilt downtown Manhattan, and everybody in the world watched, and everybody in the world loved New York, and loved New Yorkers. And I have to tell you, that was a very insulting statement that Ted made.\" Ahead of New York's April 19 primary, Cruz is arguing that his decisive win in Wisconsin is a turning point in the campaign that will propel him to the nomination. But he's also being forced to once again defend his words about New York. Cruz says he's met New Yorkers on the campaign trail who share his dislike for \"the values of the liberal Democratic politicians that have been hammering the people of New York for a long time.\" Cruz press secretary Catherine Frazier told NPR she believes New York conservatives \"know exactly what Ted Cruz was talking about. What he's talking about are the liberal values of New York politicians who have embraced gun control; they haven't respected those who have the values of pro-life. This is about the politics and the values of the politicians that run the state, and we think Republicans in New York realize that, and I think that is something they can absolutely get behind.\" Cruz's Past Remarks And Votes Return To Haunt Him That is not necessarily leading to New York Republican support for Cruz. U.S. Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., for one, is saying he'd never support Cruz. King backed Florida Sen. Marco Rubio for the nomination before Rubio dropped out of the race. A former Republican congresswoman from New York, Nan Hayworth, said in an email to NPR that she believes Cruz's \"New York values\" comment will hurt him in her state. She had backed Carly Fiorina, who got out of the race and eventually endorsed Cruz. \"While I very much admire Sen. Cruz for having had the gumption to inform Iowans that he opposes ethanol subsidies \u2014 a fiscal position that is, like most of his fiscal positions, correct \u2014 when it comes to his previous assertions about New York, his boldness was unwise,\" Hayworth said. Hayworth also said that some of Cruz's policy positions, including his votes against Hurricane Sandy relief and compensation for Sept. 11 victims, \"will sit very poorly with New Yorkers.\" The Empire State's demographics are less favorable for Cruz in comparison, for example, with Iowa and Wisconsin. And it's home turf for Trump, who is way ahead in the polls. While rural and suburban areas may be friendlier to a candidate like Cruz, he has to win over a majority of New York Republicans. Nearly 53 percent live in the New York City metro area, according to current voter registration data. Cruz senior communications adviser Jason Miller said the campaign will continue to use its sophisticated data and analytics operation to spend time in areas of the state where advisers see opportunities for Cruz to make inroads. \"We're gonna go where we believe we have the best chance to win delegates,\" he said.

            "article_content": "Donald Trump is looking to rebound from a big loss in Wisconsin with a big win in his home state of New York, where many voters near the Great Lakes have seen job losses in manufacturing.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: Now to the presidential race. Wisconsin handed Donald Trump a big loss yesterday, so now the billionaire candidate is looking to regain his footing and build on the lead he still holds over Sen. Ted Cruz. The next big primary state to vote happens to be Trump's home state, New York. NPR's Don Gonyea was there today, talking to voters in Buffalo. DON GONYEA, BYLINE: On Route 5, just south of downtown Buffalo, you'll find hulking shells of former steel mills, a still-bustling Ford factory and, right in between, the faded orange siding of the Woodlawn Diner. It's been here for 50 years. That's where Carl Giarrano was finishing up his breakfast today. I asked if he he's got a candidate. CARL GIARRANO: Yes. GONYEA: Who do you like? GIARRANO: Trump. GONYEA: OK, so tell me why. GIARRANO: I think he'll get things done. I think he'll sidestep a lot of the political issues that have stymied the area, the country for quite a while. GONYEA: Giarrano says the steel factories that were once the economic engine here only underscore Trump's message about how the U.S. has been taken advantage of when it comes to trade. GIARRANO: Trump was talking about trade equalization back in the '80s. And at that time, he was talking about Japan and Mexico. And now, it's all the same verbiage, except it's China and Mexico. GONYEA: So you think he's been right for a long time? GIARRANO: Yes. GONYEA: On Ted Cruz, Giarrano says the senator doesn't have any more experience than President Obama had when he took office. He says that's a problem, but he also acknowledges yesterday's result in Wisconsin gives him pause. GIARRANO: Less confident, probably, than a month ago, but I'm hopeful. GONYEA: Nineteen-year-old Jeremy Pulsui lives right behind the diner. He's working on his Jeep Cherokee next to the curb. JEREMY PULSUI: Oh, I'm just fixing my tire. I had a bubble in the back of the wall for a while. GONYEA: Pulsui, who's going to school to be a welder, is not a Trump supporter. PULSUI: Oh, his ego's way too big for his body. GONYEA: He says he does see a lot of Trump bumper stickers, though. PULSUI: I've talked to mixed feelings about him. I've talked to people that don't like him at all. I've talked to people that love his ideas. Me, personally, building a wall - that's not right. That's not what the States was built on. GONYEA: Pulsui isn't sure if he'll even vote in the New York primary. If he does, he says it'll only be to vote against Trump. He acknowledges that he knows nothing about Trump's rivals, Ted Cruz or John Kasich. Walking down the street a few blocks away was Brianna Leonard, who says she's turning 18 in weeks and is voting for the first time this year. She says she's neither Republican nor Democrat and offers a rare opinion of Trump - ambivalence. BRIANNA LEONARD: I don't like Donald Trump, but I don't have a problem with him either (laughter). GONYEA: She does cut Trump some slack over recent controversies, such as when he suggested that women who have illegal abortions should be punished. LEONARD: No, because he corrected himself. Everyone messes up sometimes. I mean, he's human. GONYEA: On that same block, there's a business located in an old house with a sign out front that says Donald Trump T-shirts. Inside I found owner Daniel Hanna, who says he's been shipping them out to stores wholesale. DANIEL HANNA: Well, it's good business. We sold over 4,000 of them for $9. GONYEA: Hanna, who's 65, says he's a lifelong Democrat who voted for Bill Clinton and Barack Obama twice each. But this year, it's Trump. He says he likes Trump because he tells it like it is and because of Trump's business success. But he's also not above offering a bit of advice. HANNA: Keep his mouth shut a little bit. Sometimes you've just got to look in the mirror and say, I have to tone myself down; I'm out of control here, you know? GONYEA: Can he do that? HANNA: I hope he can. You know, I really do. GONYEA: And with that, Hanna straightens the green Trump T-shirts on the rack and says he's got to get back to work. Don Gonyea, NPR News, Buffalo. Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "Exit polling shows Sens. Ted Cruz and Bernie Sanders leading in the state, says NPR's Ron Elving.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: Voters in Wisconsin have been at the polls all day casting votes in the presidential primary. Polls closed just minutes ago, and we're going to check in on both Democrats and Republicans in this part of the program. First, we're joined here in the studio by NPR senior editor and correspondent Ron Elving, who is tracking the results. Ron, these moments after the polls have closed. What do we know so far? RON ELVING, BYLINE: We know that there are early vote counts that show that Ted Cruz on the Republican side is running ahead. And we know that there are early vote counts on the Democratic side that show that Bernie Sanders is running ahead. This would not be a terribly big surprise. That is the arrangement that we had been anticipating through the day and really over the past week or so. SHAPIRO: It's not a terrible surprise in the context of recent polls. But in the context of Wisconsin, it sort of is because Wisconsin tends to go for the front-runners. ELVING: Yes, in the sense of Wisconsin's history, if you go back all the way to 1956, they have been with the leading candidate and eventual nominee in almost every instance - a couple of exceptions in '64, one exception in 1984. Apart from that, they go with the flow. They go with the candidate who's leading and on his way to the nomination. SHAPIRO: All right. Well, let's check in with the Republican side of the campaign. NPR's Sarah McCammon is in Milwaukee, Wisc., where Ted Cruz is holding a party with supporters. And, Sarah, I understand you have been talking with voters there. What are they telling you? SARAH MCCAMMON, BYLINE: Well, they're really hoping for a big win for Ted Cruz tonight. He has been ahead on average in the latest polls, so that hope is probably not misplaced. And as we just heard, it looks like there are some good signs for Cruz so far. They're hoping he wins big. They're hoping that gives him a lot of momentum and delegates going forward into, you know, future contests. And I'm hearing from supporters that, you know, a real dislike of Donald Trump. People who've come out to this Cruz event are obviously very excited about Ted Cruz, and they really hope that he can overtake Trump for the Republican nomination. SHAPIRO: We should let listeners know there is a slight delay on your line, but the Never Trump crowd is pointing to Wisconsin as a possible turning point. From what you've heard among Republicans, would a Cruz win in Wisconsin tonight be a turning point against Trump or just a little bump in the road for his campaign that is otherwise chugging along? MCCAMMON: It kind of depends on how big of a win it is. This is not a winner-take-all state, so the delegates could be split depending on how Cruz and Trump do and Kasich in various parts of the state. So it depends a lot on that, on how big of a win it is for Cruz if he wins. If he sweeps then Trump would be left needing 56 percent, I believe, of the remaining delegates to win. If Trump were to take all the delegates, which looks unlikely but just hypothetically, he'd only need 51 percent. So, you know, it could make a significant difference. It could chip away substantially at Trump's delegate lead and make it harder for Trump to go into the convention this summer with enough delegates to win outright, which of course then takes us into sort of less charted territory as far as who would become the nominee. SHAPIRO: Right, getting into that question of whether Trump will have 1,237 - that magic number he needs to win outright in the convention. Remind us what has been happening in the Republican contest that could make this a more difficult road for Trump than it has been up till now. Some things have not gone his way, perhaps self-inflicted wounds you could say. MCCAMMON: Yes. He's had a difficult week this last week or so, a couple of missteps on the issue of abortion, statements that made both the left and the right unhappy when he said last week that women who - that abortion should be banned then if it's banned women who receive illegal abortions should be punished. He quickly backtracked on that. But then just a few days later in another interview Trump said that essentially that abortion laws should stay as it is, that it shouldn't change and also had - his campaign had to walk that back. That made a lot of conservative Republicans, especially conservative Christians, very unhappy to hear the Republican front-runner say that. And, you know, I've been talking with voters this week at Cruz and Trump events. And the Cruz supporters, many of them say they either will not vote for Trump under any circumstances or it would be very hard for them. They would only do it because they believe Hillary Clinton will be the nominee and they think she would be worse. But, you know, it seems to have damaged Trump. And, you know, he has had a history of making statements that were controversial. And he's had - he has a lot of people in the party that don't like him and has for a long time. So that's not really new. It seems that, though, as the field narrows, you know, many people are consolidating behind Ted Cruz. And Cruz is certainly trying to make the case that he's the only one who can beat Trump at this point. SHAPIRO: That's NPR's Sarah McCammon covering the Republican side of the race, speaking to us from Milwaukee, Wisc. And covering the Democratic side of the race, NPR's Tamara Keith is in New York. And, Tam, explain why you're in New York given that the voting tonight is happening in Wisconsin. TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Well, because neither of the candidates on the Democratic side are in Wisconsin tonight. Hillary Clinton was here in New York earlier today for an event - a campaign event, a women for Hillary event in Brooklyn. And then tonight she attended a fundraiser. Meanwhile, Bernie Sanders is in Laramie, Wyo., and he'll be giving a speech a little bit later. So - and the reason Hillary Clinton is campaigning in New York is of course because April 19 is the New York primary. And it has a large delegate prize and it is the birthplace of Bernie Sanders and the adopted home state of Hillary Clinton. And there's a lot at stake in New York. SHAPIRO: Well, even though Clinton is in New York and Sanders is in Wyoming, Wisconsin could have an impact on the Democratic side of the race. What is its importance tonight? KEITH: The importance is really for Bernie Sanders. If he can win and win big, then he can make a case that he's on a roll. I mean, he already is on a roll. But he has - he's won in several sort of smaller states, in caucus states. This is a primary. If he is able to get a big win, then he can say, hey, look, I've got momentum. Let's keep this going. He can raise a lot of money. SHAPIRO: I think Wisconsin would be number six in a row for him. Is that right? KEITH: I think it is - would actually be seven. SHAPIRO: Seven. KEITH: Yeah. SHAPIRO: So then looking ahead, Hillary Clinton in New York, Bernie Sanders in Wyoming, is this the same divide we've been talking about for months now - narrative versus delegate math? KEITH: Yes. Yes, in fact. So Bernie Sanders is in Wyoming, which is a state that is having a Democratic caucus on Saturday. He is widely expected to win that and then he'll have 8 out of 9 of the last contests. And still Hillary Clinton will have a very large lead in the delegates. And the delegates are how you win the Democratic nomination. It isn't really about momentum. And Sanders will be in a position, though, starting to make an argument that, hey, look, I've won a lot of states. I'm winning states. And he will begin trying to make an argument to those superdelegates, those people out there that are able to put their vote toward the nomination to say, hey, you should be supporting me because I won in your state. So that's where it goes next. But Hillary Clinton still has a huge lead in the pledged delegates. She has a huge lead in the popular vote. Wisconsin will likely cut into that lead a little bit, but she's up nationwide popular vote by 2.5 million votes. SHAPIRO: That's NPR's Tamara Keith covering the Democratic side of the race with the Clinton camp in New York. And let's wrap up this segment back with Ron Elving here in studio. Ron, could tonight's results in Wisconsin, if they go the way they're leaning - Cruz and Sanders - provide a dramatic turn for the race or just a little bit of a shift? ELVING: It looks like it's going to add to the momentum that as Tam was saying Bernie Sanders has been building up over the last several weeks ever since he had that one bad night in March - March 15 - when he lost five states to Hillary Clinton. Since then, he's really been quite dominant. Although he did lose in Arizona, which was about half a million voters. And most of those states that he's been winning since have been smaller in terms of their voting population because either that they're smaller states - Hawaii, Alaska - or because they have caucuses, which are usually only attended by the most activist members of the party. So momentum for Bernie Sanders. On the Trump side - what Cruz is trying to do tonight is a game changer. SHAPIRO: NPR's Ron Elving, more results to come. Thanks, Ron. ELVING: Thank you, Ari.

            "article_content": "The front-runners in the GOP and Democratic presidential races are looking to shore up their status in Tuesday's Wisconsin primaries.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: In Wisconsin, voters are casting ballots in primary elections. We've looked at how the Republican and Democratic races are going in that state. Now to look at what it all could mean for the larger race to the White House. NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson is back here with us once again in the studio. Hi, Mara. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Hello, Ari. SHAPIRO: Let's start with the Republicans. What are the stakes for Donald Trump in Wisconsin? LIASSON: The stakes are very high. His opponents say this could be his Waterloo. If he wins all of Wisconsin's 42 delegates, he will only need 51 percent of the remaining delegates. If he loses, he'll need 56 percent. The results also could be somewhere in between because Wisconsin is a winner-take-some state. They give 18 delegates to the winner, then three delegates each to the winner of each congressional district. There's a big difference between needing 51 percent and needing 56 percent, and that shows you how, this late in the contest, each state takes on more importance. SHAPIRO: Setting aside the delegate math, if Trump loses Wisconsin, does that show that his presidential bid is losing momentum? LIASSON: That's certainly how the Stop Trump people will explain it. Wisconsin is significant for Trump. I think if he wins there, he's all but certain to get the 1,237 delegates he needs to win on the first ballot at the convention this summer. If he loses Wisconsin, it's going to be much, much harder. And Donald Trump is not gaining strength as the primary season grinds on. In other words, he's not getting bigger and bigger margins of victory. The opposition to him is just getting more stubborn. And he's had a rough couple of weeks. You had the head-spinning series of conflicting statements on abortion, his defense of his campaign manager, who's been charged with battery against a female reporter. Then there are new polls that show his unfavorable ratings with the general electorate are growing, particularly with key groups like women. He's had rough patches before, and he's famously said he could go out on Fifth Avenue and shoot someone... SHAPIRO: Right. LIASSON: ...And he wouldn't lose any voters. But now Republicans are saying it's not one single thing he's said or done - it's a cumulative effect. And Peggy Noonan, who's a former Reagan speechwriter and a conservative columnist, said all of them together form a large blob of sheer, dumb grossness. SHAPIRO: OK (laughter) what do you see for the Republicans when you look beyond Wisconsin? LIASSON: Well, beyond Wisconsin, the states coming up look pretty good for Donald Trump - New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, California. You've got a mix of moderate voters and voters who've been hit hard economically. That's why the Stop Trump people see Wisconsin as so important. It's their last good chance to stop him from getting 1,237 delegates at the convention. SHAPIRO: All right, let's talk about the Democrats. Bernie Sanders has some momentum. He's been talking about a string of wins. Could a victory in Wisconsin tonight turn the race for him? LIASSON: If he wins tonight, he will have won six of the last seven states, so that will give him a lot of momentum. And for Bernie Sanders, that always means a burst of money - many, many millions of dollars. Both Sanders and Clinton are already campaigning in New York State, her home state, which votes in two weeks. If Sanders could beat her there or come very close, it would be a huge psychological blow. Still, it's going to be hard for him to overtake her delegate lead. If he wins Wisconsin, Sanders still needs 57 percent of the remaining delegates - 66 percent if you count the superdelegates - and it's hard to catch up because Democrats give out their delegates proportionally, not winner-take-all. So he has to win the remaining states and win them big. Sanders's campaign says they're preparing for a contested convention. The Clinton campaign says that's out of the question. But in order for Sanders to convince the superdelegates to switch to him, he has to beat her so badly that she begins to look like a less-than-viable general election candidate, and he has not been able to do that yet. SHAPIRO: NPR's Mara Liasson has been with us for the last four months covering these primaries and caucuses, and she will be with us all this evening as results come in from Wisconsin. Thanks, Mara.

Polls ahead of Tuesday's Wisconsin primary contests gave Cruz and Sanders narrow leads. There's a lot on the line for both parties in Tuesday's Wisconsin contest. For Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, the state is a prime chance to stop Donald Trump and complicate the GOP front-runner's path to the nomination. For Bernie Sanders, a win over Hillary Clinton helps close his delegate deficit and gives the Vermont senator new momentum heading into the next stretch of the primary calendar. Polls in the state will close at 9 p.m. EDT, and we'll have live coverage at elections.npr.org along with our live elections special. Here's what to watch for in each contest. Cruz looks to capitalize on conservative opposition to Trump Coming off a bad week where he dealt with criminal charges against his campaign manager and stumbled over his position on abortion, Trump needs a victory to change the narrative. But most of the final polls have shown Cruz with a steady but tightening lead. On paper, this should be fertile territory for Trump. Wisconsin's GOP electorate is overwhelmingly white, fewer than half of voters had a college degree in the 2012 primary, and just over a third of voters identify themselves as evangelical. But Trump has run into resistance from the state's influential conservative radio hosts; many of Wisconsin's top right-wing talkers have dismissed the real estate mogul as a fraud and a disaster. The hostility is something the Trump campaign apparently didn't anticipate. He had a tense interview with WTMJ's Charlie Sykes, who is part of the #NeverTrump movement. And during another talk with WISN's Vicki McKenna, Trump hung up when she challenged him over his controversial tweet of an unflattering photo of Cruz's wife, Heidi. By congressional district, Donald Trump is expected to be strongest in the western half of the state; Ted Cruz, the eastern half; and John Kasich, around the state capital. Credit: Alyson Hurt and Jessica Taylor/NPR He also has hammered his onetime rival Scott Walker over the Wisconsin governor's performance in the state. But Republican observers there say the attacks against Walker \u2014 who has won three elections in a blue state in four years and whose popularity remains about 80 percent among GOP voters \u2014 could backfire. In the final hours of the campaign, Trump has been focused on the state's rural areas, making stops in La Crosse and Superior on Monday. Those areas in the west and north of the state (also where conservative talk radio doesn't penetrate as much), including the 3rd and 7th Congressional Districts, are where he could perform best. And since the Badger State's 42 delegates are awarded in a dual system \u2014 15 to the statewide winner and then 24 split to the winners of each congressional district \u2014 he could still gain delegates there even if he loses statewide. The Green Bay-based 8th District could be tighter between Cruz and Trump, but GOP observers in the state expect the Texas senator to do best in the most populous southeastern areas around Milwaukee. Even though Wisconsin shares many similarities with the Buckeye State, the best hope for Ohio Gov. John Kasich to pick up any delegates may be in the Madison-based 2nd District. Last week's Marquette Law poll showed Kasich narrowly edging out Trump there. It's one of the most liberal parts of the state, and the district's few GOP voters are more moderate. Sanders hopes for a progressive boost Most of the polls out of Wisconsin over the past week have given Bernie Sanders a narrow edge over rival Hillary Clinton. The Vermont senator has hit the ground hard over the past few days, holding rallies across the state Monday. Meanwhile, Clinton was campaigning in New York, looking ahead to the Empire State primary in two weeks. Her husband, former President Bill Clinton, hit the stump in Wisconsin in her stead; her absence was seen by some as a tacit acknowledgement that a loss Tuesday was likely. But Sanders needs a big victory in the state to cut into Clinton's 263 pledged-delegate advantage. Of the Democrats' 86 pledged delegates, 57 will be awarded proportionally by congressional district, while 19 will be given to the statewide victor. Eight years ago, Barack Obama beat Clinton by 18 points in the state. Its Democrats have a strong progressive streak, which should play to Sanders' advantage. It's also an open primary, and Sanders has traditionally done better in those than in closed contests where only registered Democrats can vote. Sanders should do well in the areas around Madison; it's where the University of Wisconsin is anchored and has traditionally been a progressive hotbed. According to the Marquette Law poll, he is also performing well in the north and western parts of the state. Clinton needs to get big margins around Milwaukee and Green Bay and their suburbs to topple Sanders. The Marquette Law poll showed a close contest in those regions.",

He also said he'd be OK if NATO broke up. More and more Republicans are saying he may have shot himself in the foot for real this time, although those predictions haven't always been true in the past. But it's not one single outrageous thing that he's said. It's the aggregation of all of them together. And Peggy Noonan, who's a conservative columnist, called this the large blob of sheer dumb grossness. His negatives with key groups for the general election, particularly women, are getting very high. More and more Republicans are despairing about his general election chances. And then there is the buzzsaw of Wisconsin itself. KELLY: Right. Well, stay with Wisconsin itself for a minute because it seems like this is a state that demographically should be very fertile ground for Donald Trump. LIASSON: It should, but there is a big group of very tuned-in Republican voters. They've been through a lot of races. They've fought off a recall against Gov. Scott Walker, who was a presidential candidate. Now he dropped out the race, and now he's endorsed Ted Cruz. Paul Ryan, the speaker of the House, is a revered figure in Wisconsin. He's criticized Trump, although he hasn't endorsed anyone in the race. Then there's a group of conservative talk show hosts who are very influential and most of them are in the stop Trump movement. So there are a lot of headwinds. It's a big state. And what's unusual for Trump is that in some polls, he is polling well behind Ted Cruz. KELLY: Now, interesting things afoot on the Democratic side as well. It looked for a moment there as though Hillary Clinton might have this whole thing put away. But in Wisconsin, Bernie Sanders is polling ahead. LIASSON: That's right. This is a state with a lot of white liberals. It's a good state for Sanders.  Even though Hillary Clinton has a big lead in the delegate count, she's also having to defend herself in Wisconsin but also her home turf of New York State. And she's shown some frustation on the campaign trail. If Sanders beats her in Wisconsin or comes very close in New York, that could change things, although he still needs to win almost all of the remaining contests by very large margins to overtake her delegate lead. KELLY: Big picture, Mara, with all due respect to the great state of Wisconsin, how much does Tuesday's vote there matter in the grand scheme of things? LIASSON: It does matter. It's important for Donald Trump. A loss makes the delegate math harder for him. If he wins Wisconsin, he only needs 51 percent of the remaining delegates. If he loses, he needs 56 percent. For Hillary Clinton, this is less of a math problem than a momentum problem. She's way ahead of Sanders, but he just won the last three contests. If he gets Wisconsin, he'll get momentum and a fresh chance to raise millions of more dollars. And it will make her look as if she is not as strong a front-runner as Democrats thought. KELLY: OK, the latest there on candidate math and momentum from NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson. Thank you, Mara. LIASSON: Thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.

According to Donald Trump, he's got an amazing relationship with women. \"I respect women. I love women. I cherish women!\" Trump said at political conference last year, but it's a version of a line he repeats often on the campaign trail. His poll numbers and recent comments, though, tell a slightly different story. Trump's favorability numbers with female voters are low enough that they could cause a problem for him should he be the candidate in the general election. The Republican front-runner's remarks this week that he is in favor of some form of punishment for women who have abortions sparked outrage from Democrats and Republicans alike. He has since walked back those comments. But those are just the latest in a list of statements Trump detractors say are anti-women, which includes his attacks on Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly and his recent feud with rival Ted Cruz over their wives. \"It's a slap in the face to all kinds of women,\" said Chelsea Bashi, a 25-year-old Republican, who volunteers for Cruz's campaign. She doesn't believe Trump's assertion that he has a great relationship with women. Bashi says it hurt her personally when Trump retweeted an unflattering photo of Cruz's wife, Heidi, alongside a glamor shot of his wife, Melania, last month. \"First of all beauty shouldn't be defined by how you look. It should be defined by what you do for others,\" Bashi said. \"A woman like [Heidi Cruz] should not be insulted.\" Another Cruz supporter, Debbie Bennett, of Lee's Summit, Mo., says the way Trump talks about women is unpresidential. \"Women individually need to look at that and see if that's the kind of leader that they want. It's not the kind of leader that I want to lead my country or to represent me in foreign countries,\" Bennett said. At Trump campaign rallies, however, you will find devoted female fans. Jeanne Tarantino, a homemaker from Waukesha, Wis., said there are more important things to worry about than Trump offending someone. \"I think the bigger issue is the economy,\" Tarantino said, adding that today many women are the breadwinners for their families. \"We need an economic recovery and if we don't do these things then my daughter's generation and the next generation after her, my grandchildren, will suffer the results.\" Just over half of Republican women said they could support Trump in a recent NBC/Wall Street Journal poll. That's significantly lower than his GOP rivals, but it might be enough for Trump to secure the Republican nomination. But that's only half the battle. If Trump becomes the nominee, there's another number from that poll he'll have to contend with: 70 percent of women overall have an unfavorable view of him. \"It's not just that people don't like him a little bit \u2014 it's that there is such a strong number of strongly unfavorable women,\" Republican pollster Kristen Soltis Anderson said. She notes it has been historically difficult for Republicans to appeal to female voters. \"When you are looking at trying to win the White House and you're struggling so much with a majority of the electorate, which is what women represent, it makes it just very difficult to envision a clear path to the White House for someone like Donald Trump who has taken an already difficult situation for the GOP and made it significantly worse,\" Anderson said. Don't expect Trump's statements on women to go away anytime soon. They are likely to show up repeatedly in attack ads, said Democratic pollster Celinda Lake. \"He has been his own worst enemy with women. He's like your worst date ever \u2014 it just keeps getting worse and worse and worse as the evening goes on,\" Lake said. Lake said she believes Trump could cause problems for Republicans down the ballot by motivating anti-Trump voters. \"I think if he's the nominee, you are going to see record numbers of women turning out and you're going to see record of numbers of women voting against him.\" Women aren't Trump's only demographic challenge. He is also deeply unpopular with minority and younger voters \u2014 who tend to lean Democratic. Trump's task, if he's the Republican nominee, will be to inspire enough supporters in a deeply divided GOP to offset that \u2014 and again defy the odds.",

Could that be a problem come November?\n                \n                    \n                    Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Three Republican candidates; a wide range of political beliefs. Could that be a problem come November? Donald Trump has some big polling problems. Yes, the GOP front-runner has blown away his opponents in many primaries and caucuses. But he also suffers from ultrahigh unfavorable ratings, even among the groups that should like him. Just had a very nice meeting with @Reince Priebus and the @GOP. Looking forward to bringing the Party together --- and it will happen! On Thursday, he tweeted that he could bring the Republican Party together, on the same day that two different polls showed the difficulties he might still face as the campaign wears on. A new study gives a few more signs of what ails the GOP, and could ail Trump come November. Not only do the party's voters doubt whether they can fall in line behind their front-runner, but they are widely divided on an array of issues (and therefore candidates). And while it's true that Democrats get angry from time to time about who's more \"progressive\" or could better \"stand up to Wall Street,\" new data from the Pew Research Center suggest that the problem of bringing together a big swath of diverse viewpoints is much bigger for Republicans right now. Pew found that 64 percent of Democratic and leaning-Democratic voters believed their party would \"solidly unite\" behind Clinton as a nominee. That's right in line with how Republican and Democratic voters felt about McCain and Obama, respectively, in 2008. For Trump, the figure is only 38 percent. Fewer than 4 in 10 GOP and GOP-leaning voters believe their party will unite behind the candidate with a massive delegate lead. It's possible there's a perception problem there \u2014 maybe those voters underestimate their fellow Republicans' (and Republican-leaners') willingness to back Trump. But other Pew data show just how big of a gulf a GOP candidate will have to close. The data also make clear just how much bigger it is among Republican candidates' supporters than Democrats'. The average gap between the two farthest-separated views on any given topic on the Republican side is 20.6 points. The average window between Sanders' and Clinton's supporters views, meanwhile, is about 7.8 points. The only topics in Pew's list that seem to really separate Sanders and Clinton supporters are foreign affairs (whether U.S. global involvement makes things better or worse) and to what degree the economic system favors powerful interests. Meanwhile, Republican candidates' supporters are widely divided on a variety of topics \u2014 immigration, anger with the government, \"scrutiny\" of Muslim Americans, trade, and abortion. This isn't to say the GOP can't unify in November. For one thing, people choose to vote \u2014 or not vote \u2014 for a candidate based on a lot of other, hard-to-pin-down factors (think how \"presidential\" someone is or the perennial \"would you have a beer with her/him\" question). Ted Cruz and John Kasich's supporters, for example, clearly have some sizable divides on topics like how much scrutiny Muslims should be subject to, as well as immigration and abortion. But only around 25 percent of Kasich's supporters say Cruz would be a \"poor\" or \"terrible\" president. And only 17 percent of Cruz's supporters say so of Kasich. And then there is Trump. Fifty percent of Cruz's supporters and 55 percent of Kasich's say Trump would be \"poor\" or \"terrible.\" It's not just among Republicans. Trump is also by far the least confidence-inspiring general-election candidate, by Pew's data. Fifty-nine percent of Pew's registered-voter respondents said he'd be a \"poor\" or \"terrible\" president. The Pew data suggest a counterintuitive problem for the GOP: that its candidates' general and primary election standings are upside down right now. Kasich, the GOP candidate who seems to be at least somewhat acceptable to many potential general-election voters (at least per these data) is also doing by far the worst in primaries and many polls. And Trump, who is by far on the clearest path to the nomination, also is so polarizing that it could cripple his general election chances. Pew isn't by any means the only organization to have found these sorts of problems for Trump. An ABC/Washington Post poll released Thursday found Trump was viewed unfavorably among more than 50 percent within even Republican-leaning demographics like white men, white self-described evangelicals, non-college-educated whites, and conservatives. But there's another conundrum here: Kasich and Cruz, many of whose supporters seem to say they could stand the other candidate, clearly haven't inspired the fervor (read: the huge vote totals) that Trump has. So even if they could be more acceptable in a general election, the question is whether they could drive turnout. That is, how many people would leave the house to vote for someone they think would be an \"average\" president? Thirty-nine percent of Pew's registered-voter respondents said that of Kasich, the most of any of the five candidates. In that light, maybe it's no surprise that Pew also found that only 35 percent of Americans think the primary process chooses the best candidate. Right now, the leading GOP candidate is also alienating many within his own party.",

            "article_content": "Donald Trump entered into the abortion debate on Wednesday when he was asked whether women who underwent the procedure, if it were banned, should be punished. He quickly walked back his answer.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump says women should not be punished for abortions hours after he said they should. His original remark outraged both people who favor abortion rights and people who oppose abortions. Consider Marjorie Dannenfelser, an anti-abortion activist heard earlier on today's program. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST) MARJORIE DANNENFELSER: The pro-life movement has never, for very good reason, promoted the idea that we punish women. In fact, we believe that women are being punished before the abortion ever occurs. INSKEEP: She said it sounded like Trump has never given this issue much thought, even though it is vital to many in the Republican Party. NPR's Sarah McCammon is following the Trump campaign. She is in Wisconsin where a primary is coming right up. Sarah, good morning. SARAH MCCAMMON, BYLINE: Good morning, Steve. INSKEEP: How unhappy are abortion opponents today? MCCAMMON: Well, as we heard, for a long time, the anti-abortion rights movement has been unified around the idea that while they'd like to end legalized abortion in most or all cases, punishing women isn't the way to go. They say abortion is bad for women and that providers should be held accountable, not women. And, Steve, these groups don't want to come across as anti-woman. That is a charge that's often leveled at organizations that oppose abortion rights or public funding for contraception. And this could be a problem for Republicans. I mean, these issues are almost certain to come up in the general election. And Republicans have to think about the female vote. So this comment by Trump was very off-message, and we did see him quickly walk it back saying providers should be punished, not women. INSKEEP: And you're underlining an important point here. There's a moral and philosophical argument to be made here about what it is right, what is wrong, who should be punished, if anyone. But there's also a political argument, and you're saying that this is seen, even by those who oppose abortion, as a political loser, this idea. MCCAMMON: It seems that way. And it is a reminder, Steve, that, you know, Trump has not always been a Republican and has not always been against abortion rights, which is something that his Republican rivals for the nomination have gone after him for. And, you know, this statement really just highlighted that. And we are hearing, you know, anti-abortion activists saying - anti-abortion rights groups, you know, saying that Trump needs to listen. And he was called yesterday out of touch with the pro-life movement, as one statement put it. So, you know, these are some real doubts we're seeing about Trump's authenticity. And I should also point out that some of these organizations that have come out to criticize Trump have already backed Texas Senator Ted Cruz. INSKEEP: Well, how is Cruz using this incident? MCCAMMON: You know, he is far behind Donald Trump in the Republican race. But he is seizing on the same idea saying that Trump hasn't carefully thought out these issues. But, Steve, if you look at what's been going on with the Republican race, you know, Trump is beating Cruz even among Evangelicals. So this is a reminder that, you know, Trump doesn't fit in the traditional boxes a lot of candidates fit into. And, you know, again, we're seeing how Trump isn't incredibly well-versed in some of these issues - sometimes struggles when pressed for specifics. But it doesn't seem to matter to many Republican primary voters. INSKEEP: Republican primary voters - but what if he were to get the Republican nomination? And he, of course, is leading. What does this mean for the general election? MCCAMMON: That is where this could really be a big concern for Republicans, Steve. You know, we are likely to hear about this more and more. Within just a couple of hours of this coming out yesterday, Hillary Clinton pounced on it. You know, she tweeted out a video that was basically just what Trump said plus a little bit of music under it. So - and yesterday on Snapchat, she had a story on her Snapchat account going after Trump for this too. So it's going to be a talking point. We're going to hear that clip a lot. Trump already has very poor approval ratings among female voters. In the last NBC Wall Street Journal poll, 70 percent of women overall had a negative view of Trump. Forty-seven percent of Republican women said they couldn't see themselves supporting him. So this kind of a stumble is not going to help him with women. It could be compounded, too, if Hillary Clinton is the Democratic nominee and Trump winds up running against the woman who, if elected, would be the first female president. INSKEEP: Did you just say almost half of Republican women - at least in this one survey - said they could not imagine voting for Donald Trump? MCCAMMON: Right, Steve, 47 percent of Republican women, which is a big number and could be a real obstacle for Trump in a general election. INSKEEP: Sarah, thanks as always. MCCAMMON: Thank you.

            "article_content": "Donald Trump speaks during a campaign rally Wednesday at St. Norbert College in De Pere, Wisconsin. Trump's comments about abortion during an MSNBC interview Wednesday outraged abortion rights opponents and advocates alike.\n                \n                    \n                    Scott Olson/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Donald Trump speaks during a campaign rally Wednesday at St. Norbert College in De Pere, Wisconsin. Trump's comments about abortion during an MSNBC interview Wednesday outraged abortion rights opponents and advocates alike. On Wednesday, Donald Trump changed his position on abortion twice in the span of three hours. In an interview with MSNBC's Chris Matthews, Trump advocated for a society in which women would have to seek abortions through illegal avenues. \"Well, you know, you will go back to a position like they had where people will perhaps go to illegal places [to get an abortion],\" he said, adding. \"But you have to ban it.\" When pressed by Matthews about consequences for the women seeking abortion under those circumstances, Trump advocated punishment. MATTHEWS: Do you believe in punishment for abortion, yes or no, as a principle? TRUMP: The answer is that there has to be some form of punishment. MATTHEWS: For the woman? TRUMP: Yes, there has to be some form. The statements immediately caused widespread controversy, outraging abortion rights opponents and advocates alike. Shortly after MSNBC released the clips, the Trump campaign backtracked, saying they weren't calling for a total ban, and that he is \"pro-life with exceptions.\" Then, a little more than two hours after the initial video was released, his campaign entirely reversed his controversial position. In a statement, he said that if abortion were to be illegal, \"the doctor or any other person performing this illegal act upon a woman would be held legally responsible, not the woman. The woman is a victim in this case as is the life in her womb.\" Not only that, but he insisted that his position had not changed. Trump is no stranger to making controversial statements. But here are a few reasons why these latest statements could be particularly damaging to his campaign: 1. He upset abortion rights opponents, not just advocates Trump spoke out against abortion, but abortion rights opponents didn't cheer. Quite the opposite, in fact. \"Mr. Trump's comment today is completely out of touch with the pro-life movement and even more with women who have chosen such a sad thing as abortion,\" said Jeanne Mancini, president of the March for Life Education and Defense Fund, in a statement. \"Being pro-life means wanting what is best for the mother and the baby. Women who choose abortion often do so in desperation and then deeply regret such a decision. No pro-lifer would ever want to punish a woman who has chosen abortion.\" Ted Cruz and John Kasich are also strongly opposed to abortion \u2014 Kasich in February signed a bill blocking state funds from reaching Planned Parenthood. Kasich supports allowing abortion only in cases of rape, incest or protecting the life of the mother. Cruz is more restrictive, having said he opposes abortion in cases of rape or incest. However, both hew to the views of mainstream abortion rights opponents in terms of punishing providers and not women seeking abortions. Since the Trump interview, both the Kasich and Cruz campaigns have condemned Trump's remarks. 2. He already has a problem with female voters (or, rather, they have a problem with him) Abortion touches lots and lots of Americans' lives. One widely cited statistic says that 1 in 3 American women will get an abortion at some point in her life. Importantly, the Washington Post's Fact Checker last year pointed out that that figure is based on 2008 data, and abortion rates have fallen since then, so the figure is likely somewhat lower at this point. However, it's true that millions of American women have gotten abortions, and many more have considered one. Knowing this, Republican strategists know that the party has to be thoughtful when talking about abortion. In his 2015 book, 2016 and Beyond: How Republicans Can Elect a President in the New America, GOP strategist Whit Ayres \u2014 who advised Marco Rubio's campaign \u2014 told Republicans to exercise \"extreme care\" in talking about abortion. \"If your audience contains women, chances are very good that you are talking to someone who is extraordinarily sensitive about the topic,\" he wrote. He pointed to statistics showing that \"three out of five Americans know someone who has had an abortion.\" The problem for Trump is that clearly even abortion rights opponents believe that his comments didn't sound like the product of \"extreme care.\" And to the extent that that costs him women's votes, that could worsen an already wide deficit that he faces. Far more than Cruz or Kasich, Trump has been favored by men over women in the primaries that have been held so far, according to data crunched by the University of Minnesota's John Coleman. There's also a gender gap in recent polling. A recent NBC/WSJ poll found that 47 percent of Republican women said they couldn't see themselves supporting Trump, compared with 52 percent who said they could. The split among men was more favorable, at 40-59. In addition, Trump is far and away the most unacceptable candidate among those women. Next in line was Cruz \u2014 32 percent of GOP women said they couldn't support him, compared with Trump's 47. Looking ahead to the general election, a recent NBC/Wall Street Journal poll showed that 70 percent of all women have an unfavorable view of Trump. 3. Most Americans believe some abortions should be legal Trump's initial, strident opposition to abortion (which he then backtracked) could have easily upset the many American voters who do believe that abortion should be legal in some form. The overwhelming majority of Americans believe \u2014 and have for a while \u2014 that abortion should be legal in all or some cases. Only around 1 in 5 Americans believes it should be illegal in all circumstances, according to Gallup. His softened, \"pro-life with exceptions\" position may put him back in line with the views of many Americans. However, his opponents \u2014 Republicans and Democrats alike \u2014 will play this clip over and over and over again, as long as he's in the race. These comments may not be a fatal blow to his campaign (pundits have for many months predicted that other controversial Trump statements were the \"beginning of the end\" for him). But they would constitute some powerful ammunition for a Trump opponent.",

            "article_content": "Donald Trump reversed his position after suffering swift backlash from both conservatives and liberals on his comments that women should be punished for getting an illegal abortion.  KELLY MCEVERS, HOST: Donald Trump entered the abortion debate today and quickly got caught up in a firestorm. During an interview with MSNBC, Trump was asked about his support for banning abortion and whether women who had abortions should be punished if the procedure was made illegal. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CHRIS MATTHEWS: Do you believe in punishment for abortion - yes or no - as a principle? DONALD TRUMP: The answer is that there has to be some form of punishment. MATTHEWS: For the woman? TRUMP: Yeah, there has to be some form. MATTHEWS: Ten cents, 10 years, what? TRUMP: That I don't know. MCEVERS: Not long after, Trump put out a statement reversing that position, saying abortion providers should be punished if abortion was illegal, not women. Here to walk through what all this means for the campaign is NPR political editor Domenico Montanaro. Welcome to the show. DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Hi. How are you? MCEVERS: Hi. Why was Trump so quick to walk this back today? MONTANARO: Well, he faced a swift backlash from groups on the left and the right. I mean, this was - never mind Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, who had predictable, you know, statements, Hillary Clinton saying that, just when you thought it couldn't get worse. Bernie Sanders called it shameful. He also faced backlash from Ted Cruz and John Kasich, which also might be predictable, given that they're running against him. Cruz said that he doesn't understand pro-life issues. Kasich said that you should not punish women. But pro-life groups, anti-abortion rights groups came out very strongly, very quickly in saying that Trump was wrong here. MCEVERS: But there was reaction from groups that oppose abortion rights. And why were they so upset with what he said? MONTANARO: Well, some of what they had to say here is the fact that when Trump said that - seemed open to punishing women, that really crossed a line for them. In the - the March for Life released a statement saying, Mr. Trump's comment today is completely out of touch with the pro-life woman - pro-life movement. They said being pro-life means wanting what is best for the mother and the baby. The Concerned Women for America said that Trump also out of touch - used those same words - and that its goals have been - the goals - that its goal is to help those who have been deceived by culture and the industry. And they said no one is advocating for the imprisonment of women seeking abortions. So this is out of the mainstream for the pro-life movement. MCEVERS: It's unusual to see Donald Trump reverse course and walk something back so quickly. I mean, was this a revealing moment for his candidacy? MONTANARO: Well, first, I should say that Donald Trump would probably try to argue that this was not a reversal. He's even said my position has not changed. Like Ronald Reagan, I'm pro-life with exceptions. But it's clear from the statement that Donald Trump decided that women - punishing women - he saw the backlash and said that that is not what should be done. He said that it should be the abortion providers or the people who perform abortions that should be the ones who are punished, not women. But this is what you get when you have somebody who's not a politician, who has not been steeped in these policy debates. And this has been a real trigger for these anti-abortion rights groups. And he just doesn't know the pitfalls. I mean, this is what happens, you know? And it could be a potential problem and liability for the Republican Party if Donald Trump is the nominee because, among the list of other groups that have felt offended, 70 percent of women have an - said they had an unfavorable rating of Donald Trump in the latest NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, and this kind of thing's landing him in controversy. While he hasn't seemed to suffer in a Republican primary, it could certainly hurt him in a general election. MCEVERS: NPR's Domenico Montanaro - thank you. MONTANARO: Thank you.

In an interview for a town hall meeting to air on MSNBC Wednesday night, Trump said \"there has to be some form of punishment\" for women. While most Republican officeholders and candidates oppose abortion rights, few have publicly stated positions on whether there should be legal penalties for women who have abortions. Most believe it is the physicians who perform them who should be prosecuted. Then, in a statement issued by the campaign after his remarks were made public, Trump said: \"If Congress were to pass legislation making abortion illegal and the federal courts upheld this legislation, or any state were permitted to ban abortion under state and federal law, the doctor or any other person performing this illegal act upon a woman would be held legally responsible, not the woman. The woman is a victim in this case as is the life in her womb. My position has not changed \u2014 like Ronald Reagan, I am pro-life with exceptions.\" .@JohnKasich reacts to Trump's abortion comments: \"Of course, women shouldn't be punished\" for having an abortion https://t.co/bLyaNPVGoE Still, Trump's remarks managed to inflame both sides of the abortion issue. The abortion rights advocacy organization NARAL Pro-Choice America called Trump's comments \"a new low.\" The group's president, Ilyse Hogue, said, \"Not only is this an unhinged position far from where the American people are, but it's sure to endanger women were he to become president.\" March For Life, a group that opposes abortion rights, said Trump's statement was \"completely out of touch with the pro-life movement and even more with women who have chosen such a sad thing as abortion.\" Jeanne Mancini, president of the March for Life Education and Defense Fund, said, \"No pro-lifer would ever want to punish a woman who has chosen abortion. This is against the very nature of what we are about.\" The presidential campaigns were also quick to criticize Trump. Ted Cruz tweeted: We shouldn\u2019t be talking about punishing women; we should affirm their dignity and gift to bring life into the world https://t.co/OwWR96YTF0 And Cruz's campaign chairman, Chad Sweet, said on CNN that Cruz \"shares the views of the pro-life movement, which for years has focused on punishing those who perform the abortions, not the women who get them.\" John Kasich responded that he would \"absolutely not\" agree with punishing women for having an abortion. \"It's a difficult enough situation, to try to punish somebody.\" In tweets, Democrat Hillary Clinton called Trump's comment \"horrific and telling,\" while Bernie Sanders called it \"shameful.\"",

If someone tells you the same thing five times, you probably should believe he means it. Back in August, Donald Trump and all the other Republican candidates were given the chance to say they would pledge support to whomever the Republican nominee would be \u2014 and not wage an independent bid for the presidency if he or she didn't win. Trump raised his hand, the only one on stage to do so, to say he would not make that pledge. He was pressed and pushed, the question was rephrased, the audience grumbled, and five times, within a span of a minute and a half, he refused to change his mind. \"I fully understand,\" Trump said then of the implications of his decision. Everything seemed to change a month later. After meeting with the Republican National Committee chairman, Reince Priebus, Trump emerged at his gilded Trump Tower holding up a Sharpie-signed 62-word pledge \"totally pledging\" to support the GOP nominee \"regardless of who it is.\" On Tuesday night, Trump changed his mind again. \"No, I don't anymore,\" Trump told CNN's Anderson Cooper when asked if he would continue to support whoever the GOP nominee is. \"We'll see who it is,\" Trump added. \"I have been treated very unfairly.\" He pointed to the \"RNC\" and the \"Republican Party establishment.\" It was just 27 days ago that all of the Republican candidates were pledging to support the eventual nominee, even if it was Trump. Now, none of them is pledging to support anyone. After bitterness with Trump, stemming from personal attacks about their wives, Ted Cruz also backed away from the pledge Tuesday night. So did John Kasich, who has been moving that direction over the past few weeks after the violent protests at a Trump rally in Chicago \u2014 and Trump's response to them. Two words are key here: \"fairness\" and \"leverage.\" Trump, as he has been saying all along, has threatened to bolt if he's not treated \"fairly.\" Now, he believes he hasn't been because of the possibility of a brokered convention and delegate allocation rules. (We get into more on why below.) In that original hand-raising debate, Trump said, \"I am discussing it with everybody, but I'm, you know, talking about a lot of leverage.\" Threatening to run third party is the biggest piece of leverage Trump has. Republicans believe an independent Trump bid would ensure a Hillary Clinton presidency, because Trump, like George Wallace in 1968, could win lots of states in the South outside of the party structure. In today's electoral map, that would imperil the GOP nominee. Why did Trump change his mind? And what about fairness? With the finish line in sight, Trump also sees a great big hurdle being erected. There's an active stop-Trump, or #NeverTrump, effort that is determined to try to keep Trump below the 1,237 delegates needed to become the GOP nominee. If they can do that, they would try to nominate someone else on the second ballot at the Republican National Convention this summer. It's not clear it would work, but Trump doesn't like what he sees and thinks it's not fair. It's as simple as this in his view: He's got the most votes, so he should be the nominee. That's not how it works. The rules of the game are \u2014 and have been since the process left the smoke-filled rooms \u2014 whoever has a majority of delegates will be the nominee. At a debate March 10, Trump called 1,237 a \"very random number.\" It's not. It's 50 percent, plus one, of the total number of voting delegates to the Republican National Convention this summer \u2014 2,472. Trump this week also threatened to sue over not getting the most delegates out of Louisiana even though he won the most votes in the primary. Again, that's not inherent unfairness, that's a lack of understanding about how the process works and having an on-the-ground organization. It may seem unfair, but those are the rules these candidates sign up for. Each state does things differently, and that's why it's so hard and so expensive to win, because you need to have a team in place that understands the rules in each state. These aren't new or unfair rules created for Trump. But for someone who's an outsider, who doesn't like the system and is fueled by support from people who also don't thoroughly understand, like or accept the system, he thinks they're unfair. Does it matter whom Trump supports? The point here is that Trump has a strong and devoted following among a significant chunk of GOP primary voters. This is Trump's biggest piece of leverage. Remember last year when Trump was saying Mexicans were \"rapists,\" and RNC officials started to delicately criticize him, saying on TV that it wasn't the tone the party needed? Trump thought that was unfair, and he started to float the idea of running as a third-party candidate. Leverage. The RNC backed off. Now, as Trump sees this effort by Washington insiders take real shape to stop him, and he continues to hear rumblings that even if he has the most votes, he might not be the nominee, Trump is using what he's got in hopes they back off again. So, it's not really about Trump supporting anyone, it's about him not running third party in the fall, and hobbling the party's chances at the White House. Some party loyalists, though, are willing to take that chance, because they believe Trump as the standard-bearer of their party would be even worse. (By the way, a Trump third-party bid may prove more complicated than Trump thinks because of complex, state-by-state ballot access rules, but if you're someone who doesn't know or care about the rules, who knows? He could run a write-in campaign \u2014 and everyone knows how to spell \"Trump.\") Does this make Trump seem indecisive, or is he making the most convenient decision at the time, like all politicians? It's certainly a risk for Trump to look like he's inconsistent. But one man's inconsistent, indecisive or even calculating is another man's unpredictable, powerful and smart. In other words, for people who didn't like him, they'll continue to think the worst. And for his supporters, they'll think more power to him, because they're there for him \u2014 not for the Republican Party.",

            "article_content": "A Republican primary in Ohio's 8th district on Tuesday shows just how fragmented the GOP has become. Fifteen candidates are running to replace former House Speaker John Boehner in this heavily conservative district. Boehner won the seat in 1990, but it's been empty since his surprise resignation last fall. The race has a lot of names, but no clear front-runner.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: There is a race tomorrow in Ohio that shows just how fragmented and conservative the GOP is these days, and it's not the presidential race. It's the Republican primary to determine who will run to fill the vacancy that Speaker of the House John Boehner created when he retired last fall. ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: It's in Ohio's 8th Congressional District. It's a safe Republican seat, and this is the first election in the 8th with no incumbent since Boehner first ran in 1990. Not surprisingly, a local state senator, Bill Beagle, who represents part of the district in Columbus, announced for the seat. I caught up with Beagle at K's, a hamburger joint in Troy, Ohio, a prosperous county seat with a domed courthouse that ranks with some state capitols. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: Tell me your name again. BILL BEAGLE: I'm Bill Beagle, like the dog. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: OK. BEAGLE: Nice to meet you. I can leave my card here. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: Bill Beagle. I love beagles. BEAGLE: Good. (LAUGHTER) SIEGEL: In one of his commercials, we get to see Bill Beagle skeet shooting. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: Washington has failed to secure our borders and keep us safe from a threat of ISIS, failed to protect our Second Amendment rights, failed to stop out-of-control spending. Let's send Bill Beagle to Congress with a record of results, a record of action. (SOUNDBITE OF GUNSHOT) SIEGEL: Beagle is conservative, pro-life, pro-gun, anti-Obamacare. But then, so is everyone who's running for the Republican nomination which is tantamount to election in the 8th. There's Beagle's fellow state legislator State Representative Tim Derickson. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TIM DERICKSON: I'm Tim Derickson. Faith and family are proof of God's grace, and it's our duty to defend them. That means returning to our nation's Christian heritage, protecting traditional families and fighting for the unborn. SIEGEL: Derickson has been endorsed by Ohio Right to Life, and he has the support of a new Washington-based nonprofit called Right Way Initiative. It says it supports constructive conservative, which, so far, just means Tim Derickson. The Conservative Club for Growth has endorsed Warren Davidson, a local businessman and West Point graduate. Davidson says he decided to run against a gridlocked, dysfunctional Washington. WARREN DAVIDSON: If one time on a budget deal, you get kind of snookered, and you either go along with this or you shut the government down, which seemed to be the endless story, you could kind of understand. But you know, six or seven, eight times in a row, you kind of go, stunning lack of creativity. SIEGEL: Well, the leader of the House Republicans was John Boehner from this district. Did he let down the party and the voters here? DAVIDSON: I think a lot of people were frustrated with his time as speaker, for sure. In the district, he's still highly regarded. As speaker, I think he'll be remembered for some of the gridlocked status quo that really produced this level of frustration. SIEGEL: Just Warren Davidson, Tim Derickson and Bill Beagle would make for a primary of varied shades of dark red in a deeply red district, but we're only beginning. Professor John Forren is a political scientist at Miami University's branch in Hamilton, Ohio. JOHN FORREN: You know, it's been an interesting year. It really is a once-in-a-generation open seat. SIEGEL: Because for all those years, John Boehner coasted to re-nomination and reelection in this masterpiece of gerrymandering. It rises north of Cincinnati along the western edge of the state, but about midway, there's an offshoot that juts out east, perfectly missing Democratic Dayton. When he quit, Boehner left behind no protege as his political heir, and he made no endorsement. There are no professed insiders here - again, political scientist John Forren. FORREN: They're all running as outsiders, and so that means you don't get a lot of praise for John Boehner. But you don't get a lot of reference, actually, to the presidential race, either. SIEGEL: J.D. Winteregg, who's worked both as a French teacher and at a grain elevator, challenged Boehner for the nomination two years ago. In his view, the speaker was enabling President Obama's spending plans. Winteregg lost, but but got 22 percent of the primary vote, and he's back in 2016 with this online commercial. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) J.D. WINTEREGG: I wasn't afraid to fight the Boehner-Obama machine. I stood on principle while others sat on the sidelines. SIEGEL: It costs just $85 to file as a candidate, and you need the signatures of just 50 registered Republican voters. The result - 15 candidates. Only 14 of them show up in candidate forums like the one I watched at Miami University. Here's a montage drawn from their short answers to a question prompted by a terrible event in the district one week earlier. It was a school shooting by a 14-year-old gunman. Four students were injured. What ought to be done about gun violence? They answered in alphabetical order, so we start with candidates Beagle, Derickson and Davidson. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BEAGLE: I don't think the answer is to keep law-abiding citizens from their guns. DERICKSON: The gun isn't the actor here. It's the person. DAVIDSON: Taking guns away from our citizens is not the answer. SCOTT GEORGE: I would start with support of our law enforcement. ERIC HAEMMERLE: The problem is that whenever there's a shooting in this nation, that we reflexively want more gun control. TERRI KING: I would look to having the teachers learn the firearms and carry them in the school. JOSEPH MATVEY: Guns are not the problem. The problem is that we need to have adequate resources for our law enforcement officials so that they can do their jobs and do them effectively. EDWARD MEER: People need to go and actually lock their firearms up and keep their kids from getting at their firearms. JOHN ROBBINS: The parents are not teaching personal responsibility. MICHAEL SMITH: I'm a constitutionalist, and I don't feel that our Second Amendment rights should ever be infringed. JIM SPURLINO: Responsible gun ownership is certainly at the core of this. KEVIN WHITE: Encourage active shooter training for the schools and the pupils. SIEGEL: That was candidate Kevin White - more from him in a moment. We also heard from businessman and proud non-politician Scott George, teacher Eric Haemmerle and lawyer Terri King, the only woman in the race - also CPA Joseph Matvey, Edward Meer, who's out to fix the problems made by the career politicians, John Robbins, an Army veteran and retired chief sewer inspector for Butler County, Michael Smith, a veterans activist and former mortgage banker and Jim Spurlino, who owns a successful concrete business. That's 12 candidates. Here are two more - J.D. Winteregg... (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) WINTEREGG: The root of the problem is a breakdown in the family. SIEGEL: ...And finally, businessman and Air Force veteran George Wooley. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) GEORGE WOOLEY: The easy answer is to take the guns away from the mentally ill. The trouble is, the medical community has been co-opted by liberals who say that if you don't agree with abortion and homosexuality, there's something wrong with you. It's not hard to imagine that they could also declare people that are Republicans and conservatives as mentally unfit as well. So until we get this political correctness swept away with the truth, I say we keep the Second Amendment as it is. (CROSSTALK) SIEGEL: The next morning to Studebaker's restaurant, I met Kevin White in his hometown of New Carlisle. Several of his neighbors and supporters were there. White flies for United Airlines. He flew C-130s for the Air Force. Before that, he was a Navy pilot. He and his wife are both Annapolis graduates. I was curious about the sense of greatness lost, the feeling that Donald Trump connects with. Well, Kevin White described for me a sense of an economy, a work ethic, a global national posture all diminished by weakness and dependency, a condition that he says goes against the American grain. WHITE: When you hear Trump talk about making America great again, when do Americans like sports so much? If they really bought into the liberal progressive ideology and rhetoric, we wouldn't be the sports fans that we are. We eat, drink and breathe sports because it's raw, unbridled American competition. The best team wins. It's out there. The rules are fair. Both sides get onto the playing field, and they tear each other up. Americans eat that stuff up. If you give Americans a level playing field and opportunity, they will outcompete, out-win and outperform any other country in the world because the strength of our country is the fabric of our melting pot. SIEGEL: That may be a mixed metaphor, but Kevin White expresses a disappointed verging on a sense of betrayal that animates many Republican voters in the 8th Congressional District of Ohio. So do his many rivals to succeed Speaker John Boehner, who, incidentally, a couple of night ago, announced his endorsement of Ohio Governor John Kasich for president. Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.

Donald Trump has abruptly canceled a planned appearance Saturday morning at the Conservative Political Action Conference, a major annual gathering of the GOP faithful. In a Friday afternoon typo-ridden statement, the GOP presidential front-runner said he instead will be holding a \"major rally on Saturday prior to Caucus\" in \"Witchita, Kanasas\" [sic]. \"Because of this, he will not be able to speak at CPAC as he has done for many consecutive years. Mr. Trump would like to thank Matt Schlapp and all of the executives at CPAC and looks forward to returning to next year, hopefully as President of the United States,\" his campaign said. There had been rumblings that the real estate mogul could face a hostile crowd at the conference sponsored by the American Conservative Union in National Harbor, Md., just outside of Washington. \"We're having [a] massive walkout on Saturday when [Trump] comes to speak,\" one activist, dressed as a Revolutionary War soldier, told the National Review. \"We already have over 300 people who are going to get up at one time to go the bathroom.\" The conference's official Twitter account expressed their disappointment and said the snub was an affront to conservatives. Very disappointed @realDonaldTrump has decided at the last minute to drop out of #CPAC -- his choice sends a clear message to conservatives. Despite leading polls nationwide and racking up a series of wins in primaries and caucuses so far, Trump has yet to win over many conservative leaders, who view his change of heart on abortion, health care and more as inauthentic. Trump's change of heart makes him the only GOP candidate who isn't speaking to the conference \u2014 Ohio Gov. John Kasich spoke Friday afternoon and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz will speak later today, while Florida Sen. Marco Rubio will speak Saturday. CPAC attendee Matt Colleran from Nashville, Tenn., supports Rubio, but said he was \"disappointed that one of our leading candidates will not be speaking to us here.\" \"We are people here who believe in free markets, traditional values and a strong national security,\" Colleran said. \"And when we decide who to vote for, we need a candidate who is willing to speak to us and who respects our values and is really a member of the conservative movement.\" Richard McCormick of Kettering, Ohio, is undecided who to vote for in his state's important primary on March 15th, but was still considering Trump. \"I'm disappointed,\" he said. \"I think it should be an inclusive event, but he's running his own show that's evident in his tactics so far. This is just another example.\" Brakkton Booker contributed.",

It's unclear what will happen to coverage if the act is repealed or amended.\n                \n                    \n                    B. Boissonnet/BSIP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Under the Affordable Care Act, insurers are required to cover birth control with no copay. It's unclear what will happen to coverage if the act is repealed or amended. In the two weeks since the election, Planned Parenthood Federation of America has seen a huge increase in volunteers and donations \u2013 over 200,000 donations in a single week. But this surge in support hasn't reached many other reproductive health organizations. And many of these centers are already struggling to meet a spike in demand for long-acting contraception after the election of Donald Trump. Susie Markus, executive director of the Wyoming Health Council, says that she's heard people in Wyoming say they're going to donate to Planned Parenthood. \"But there's only one Planned Parenthood in Wyoming.\" Her organization is the umbrella group for 15 publicly funded family planning centers in Wyoming. She's been hoping for donations, but none have come in. The nonprofit Wyoming Health Council is funded in part by Title X, a 46-year-old federal law that helps provide family planning services to the poor by distributing funds to regional grantees. They in turn support 3,951 facilities, including local health departments, federally qualified health centers, independent clinics and hospital outpatient units. About 13 percent of the facilities are run by Planned Parenthood. Title X doesn't just cover birth control; it also covers breast and cervical cancer screenings, pregnancy counseling, and testing and treatment for sexually-transmitted diseases and other services, but not abortion. Centers funded by Title X are required to see all patients, regardless of insurance coverage, and charge them on a sliding scale based on income. Clinics cover the difference between the cost of the visit and what patients can pay. In states like Indiana, funding is already so tight that the post-election rush on IUDs and other long-lasting contraceptives like implants has left clinics scraping for money. IUDs come with a high up-front cost \u2013 up to $1,000 for the device and insertion. \"At the end of the day, we've decided that if a woman wants an IUD, we will get it for her,\" says Kristen Adams, president and CEO of the Indiana Family Health Council, a nonprofit that distributes funds to 26 clinics in the state. \"That means a lot of budget shifting.\" Because the clinics provide same-day services, Adams says they typically have a few IUDs in stock. \"But can we afford to keep 20 on our shelves? No.\" Family planning organizations in other states say they can handle a brief spike in patients, but if the rush of women seeking IUDs and other reproductive services continues, things might get difficult. \"Our demand for IUDs has about doubled, but we don't know if that's a short term spike or not. I think it would take a more consistent increase for it to begin to be an issue,\" says Kate Brogan, Maine Family Planning's vice president for public affairs. She says that Maine Family Planning has also seen a slight increase in donations. This sentiment is echoed in California, which is served by Essential Access Health, the largest Title X-funded network in the country, with more than 340 clinics. According to Amy Moy, their vice president of public affairs, California's network serves about 1 million people, or one quarter of the people eligible for Title X services nationwide. She says that the state has additional programs that fund family planning for people with low incomes. One of those centers, the Women's Community Clinic in San Francisco, has received some election-related donations, but \"not like the increase Planned Parenthood has seen,\" says Carlina Hansen, their executive director. If the demand for long-acting contraceptives continues, she says her clinic will need to open up more appointments and possibly increase staffing. \"We already operate at a loss, and donations help us carry that loss. If we need to increase our staff, balancing our budget gets difficult.\" Even in states like California, Title X grantees are worried about the future. The Affordable Care Act and Medicaid expansion have increased the number of patients whose family planning visits are covered by insurance. If those expansions are rolled back, state programs and clinics will be pressed to take on the additional cost. And advocates are worried Title X will find itself on the chopping block. It's not an unfounded concern. In the last several years, numerous bills have been introduced in Congress to block Title X funds from organizations that also provide abortions, like Planned Parenthood. In 2011, the House voted to defund Title X in its entirety, but the measure didn't pass the Senate. Still, for the last several years Title X funding has decreased, from $317.5 million in 2010 to $286.5 million in 2016. Under a Trump administration and with a Republican Congress, those numbers could shrink even more. \"If we lost Title X funding \u2014 oh, gosh, given the history of Title X battles in Congress, I think that's a real question,\" says Brogan in Maine. \"Right now we have over 50 clinics. There's no way we'd be able to maintain that without Title X.\"",

Updated Nov. 9, 2016: Proposition 60 was defeated by a margin of nearly 54 percent against and 46 percent in favor, with 99 percent of California precincts reporting. When Mike Stabile first moved to Los Angeles in 2011, he was struck by a freeway billboard that showed a line of cocaine and an overturned shot glass. The caption read: \"You know why. Free HIV test.\" A billboard sponsored in 2015 by the AIDS Healthcare Foundation made a lasting impression on Mike Stabile, who now opposes the group on a proposition to mandate condom use on porn sets.\n                \n                    \n                    Courtesy of AIDS Healthcare Foundation\n                    \n                \nhide caption A billboard sponsored in 2015 by the AIDS Healthcare Foundation made a lasting impression on Mike Stabile, who now opposes the group on a proposition to mandate condom use on porn sets. \"I literally pulled over the car and was like what's going on?\" Stabile remembers. \"I was having a panic attack.\" He describes another billboard showing two men in bed, looking nervous, and posing this question: \"Trust Him?\" \"As a gay man, you really have to fight against this idea that you're constantly in danger,\" says Stabile, who came of age during the height of the AIDS epidemic in the '80s. \"Fear and stigma actually works against people getting tested.\" Stabile is a documentary filmmaker, activist and a spokesperson for the Free Speech Coalition, the trade association for the adult entertainment industry, which is opposing Proposition 60. He says he sees the same heavy-handed, moralistic attitude behind Proposition 60, the California ballot initiative that would require adult film performers to use condoms on porn sets. If the performers don't comply, and state regulators fail to enforce the mandate in a timely manner, any Californian can sue the film producer. \"Its success depends on stigma around sex, stigma around porn,\" says Stabile. The man behind Proposition 60 \u2014 and all those billboards \u2014 is Michael Weinstein, president of the AIDS Healthcare Foundation and a longtime maverick in gay activist circles. The nonprofit runs pharmacies and provides HIV care in 13 states and 37 countries, and it gave away 38.5 million condoms last year. It's putting $4.5 million from its pharmacy sales into backing the Proposition 60 condom mandate. (It has also put $14.7 million behind Proposition 61, Weinstein's initiative aimed at lowering prescription drug prices in California.) Weinstein says he's steadfastly promoting condoms when other groups seem to have forgotten them. \"It's unfashionable,\" he says. \"I was on a panel discussion and one of the guys said, 'You're acting like our mother telling us to wear galoshes.' And my reaction was 'Yeah, somebody needs to do that!' I mean, I'm not trying to win a popularity contest, obviously.\" For Weinstein, Proposition 60 is primarily about protecting adult film workers against sexually transmitted diseases \u2014 at a time when infection rates are at a 20-year high across California. But it's also another large-scale condom campaign. \"A lot of people get their sex education through these films, and I think it's sending a bad message,\" Weinstein says. \"I don't want young people to be educated that the only kind of sex that's hot is unsafe sex.\" Weinstein has long taken controversial positions, but he's often landed on the right side of history. In the 1980s, he fought lawmakers in California who wanted to quarantine AIDS patients. When nurses were afraid to touch patients, leaving them languishing in the hallways of county hospitals, he helped set up one of the first AIDS hospices, where people could die with dignity and compassion. And when AIDS drug cocktails became available, Weinstein risked bankruptcy to provide the life-extending drugs to uninsured patients. \"We decided we had a moral obligation to give them, and we paid for them and those people lived,\" he says. One of Weinstein's more recent and most unpopular stances is on pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PreP, the daily pill that can prevent people from contracting HIV. Many activists consider it a powerful tool for prevention. Weinstein doesn't see PreP that way. \"It's often taken in conjunction with crystal meth and other party drugs,\" he says. \"It's really a get-out-of-jail-free card.\" He says it gives people a free pass to not use condoms and be reckless, driving a rise in other STDs, which recent studies bear out. Performers from the adult film industry protest Prop 60 outside the AIDS Healthcare Foundation in Los Angeles.\n                \n                    \n                    April Dembosky/KQED\n                    \n                \nhide caption Performers from the adult film industry protest Prop 60 outside the AIDS Healthcare Foundation in Los Angeles. But other public health groups say PreP will reduce HIV transmission and save lives, which the studies also support. \"It's not helpful to have one of the largest HIV organizations in the world trivializing it or downplaying its importance,\" says Courtney Mulhern-Pearson, director of state and local affairs at the San Francisco AIDS Foundation. Her group, along with AIDS Project LA, is opposed to Proposition 60, in part, because it ignores PreP. Mulhern-Pearson says Weinstein's singular focus on condoms is outdated and unrealistic. \"Condom fatigue is real,\" she says. \"And I think that all of us are probably not realistic and not forthcoming about our condom use.\" History and opposition Weinstein has been fighting to mandate condoms in adult films for years. While federal and state worker safety laws technically already require producers to protect performers against STDs with condoms, the law is largely ignored and poorly enforced. Weinstein has pushed California's Division of Occupational Safety and Health, known as Cal/OSHA, to refine and clarify its regulations, without success. He's backed local measures in Los Angeles County to require condoms, which passed, but enforcement has, again, been minimal. At every turn, the adult film industry has fought the condom mandates. Some say it would force them to make products that won't sell, or that it would drive the business underground or out of state. In mid-October, more than a hundred adult film performers rallied outside Weinstein's office in Los Angeles to protest Proposition 60. They chanted slogans like \"Our Bodies, Our Choice!\" and carried signs that read \"Where is Weinstein?\" They say they prefer to rely on the industry's bi-monthly testing protocol over condoms. Performer Ela Darling says condoms don't work on porn sets; they're uncomfortable and cause friction rashes. \"The sex you have on camera isn't like the sex you have at home,\" she says. \"It's like Olympic-level, athletic sex.\" She's frustrated that Weinstein is ignoring performers' concerns. \"He will not hear us, he will not speak to us, but he's happy speaking for us,\" she says. \"And that's the problem.\" Weinstein defends his refusal to meet with the adult film industry. \"I'm not going to put myself in a position of debating people where all they do is call me names,\" he says. Weinstein's critics have called him bombastic, a bully. They compare him with Donald Trump. They post tweets that refer to him as the \"Condom Nazi.\" \"In case they haven't noticed, I'm Jewish and I'm gay, OK?\" he says. \"It makes my skin curl.\" Weinstein says he's never liked the limelight. He's had to develop a thick skin to stay in this business, to stand up for what he believes is the moral thing to do, for what he believes is his responsibility toward young generations. Yet it's clear that the criticism bothers him. \"He's been hurt,\" says Sharon Raphael, an old friend and fellow activist. \"I know that it hurts him.\" Still, she adds, everyone knows he's a force to be reckoned with. \"When most people would be down and out, strike three, he'd get up again,\" she says. \"He never gives up. Ever.\" This story is part of a reporting partnership with NPR, KQED and Kaiser Health News.",

Lawmakers return to Washington on Tuesday for what GOP party leaders are hoping will be an uneventful September for their party's most vulnerable members. \"We want a clean entry and a clean exit,\" says one Senate GOP aide, who spoke on condition of anonymity to speak candidly about internal deliberations. September's four-week legislative stretch is the last chance for congressional action before Election Day. There are only two must-pass items on the agenda: a short-term funding bill to keep the government running past Sept. 30, and a separate $1.1 billion funding bill to combat the spread of the Zika virus. Republican leaders are also trying to head off an attempt by some conservative lawmakers to impeach the head of the Internal Revenue Service. Senate Republicans are fighting an uphill battle to maintain control of the U.S. Senate this November. Likewise, House Republicans are on defense and expected to lose seats. Instead of trying to force tough political votes, party leaders and those vulnerable lawmakers would prefer to be on the campaign trail. \"There's no upsides to trying to force any unnecessary votes,\" the aide said. But some conservative Republicans feel differently. Government funding There is an effort among a faction of House Republicans to punt the short-term funding bill into next year. The goal is to preempt a 'lame duck' session after the election to block any last minute dealmaking before President Obama leaves office. Some progressive activists agree because they fear a renewed effort to approve the Trans Pacific Partnership, a long-delay and controversial trade pact that has come under fire this election year. Those concerns continue despite House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., assurances that there will be no TPP votes in the lame duck. Senate Democrats will block any effort to avoid a lame duck session, Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., told reporters on a Thursday conference call. \"We are not doing anything into next year,\" Reid said. Democrats do support a stop-gap funding bill into December and would vote for it, Reid added. Zika funding Congress also has to resolve a months-long dispute over funding Zika virus research and prevention efforts. Senate Democrats blocked consideration of the $1.1 billion House-passed bill because it included policy riders that they say would would block funds for Planned Parenthood, a health care provider at the front lines of the Zika crisis. Ratcheting up pressure on Congress to resolve the funding dispute is a warning last week from Thomas Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, that the agency is almost out of money fight the virus. On Friday, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., who is one of the senators facing a competitive reelection, said he expects the Zika funding bill to be \"part of whatever spending bill ultimately passes to fund the government beyond Sept. 30.\" \"These are not statistics, they are real people,\" Rubio said, noting that 17,000 Americans are infected with Zika, including 696 in his home state. \"And they don't even tell the full story of Zika's impact on our country, given that many women are putting off having children because of it, pregnant women who have not contracted the virus live with the worry that they might, and our economy, businesses, and workers are feeling the effect of tourists postponing trips to Florida.\" Impeachment efforts Behind the scenes, there is also a potential show down brewing between a faction of House conservatives and party leaders over whether or not to pursue impeachment proceedings for John Koskinen, commissioner of the Internal Revenue Services. Members of the House Freedom Caucus have been pursuing impeachment charges for months against Koskinen in relation to the fallout from the 2013 IRS scandal when the agency was targeting certain political groups who were seeking tax exempt status. Koskinen was not there at the time, but he's made missteps and misstatements in his dealings with Congress that have infuriated a number of conservatives. Many Republicans are reluctant to have an impeachment fight weeks before an election, and many do not believe that Koskinen has met the threshold of committing \"high crimes and misdemeanors\" to trigger impeachment proceedings. He has not been charged with any crimes. If the impeachment effort moves forward, there is potential for a dramatic political showdown this month. It could rile up Congress and the country at a time when Republican party leaders are hoping to avoid just that.",

Tim Huelskamp, R-Kan., speaks during a campaign town hall meeting at the headquarters of Patriot Outfitters. In an unusual electoral twist, it was the GOP establishment who claimed victory over conservatives with the primary defeat of Kansas Rep. Tim Huelskamp on Tuesday night. Buoyed by agriculture interest groups and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, obstetrician Roger Marshall easily ousted the three-term congressman who was one of the most hard-line conservative members of the House and a member of the rabble-rousing Freedom Caucus. \"On most issues, be it Obamacare, the Second Amendment or Planned Parenthood, Huelskamp and Marshall weren't that far apart. But Huelskamp's confrontational, anti-establishment approach had turned off his colleagues on Capitol Hill as well as many farm groups in the sprawling, 63-county district he represented,\" the Wichita Eagle reported. Much of the trouble for Huelskamp began when he was kicked off the House Agriculture Committee in 2012 after opposing then-Speaker John Boehner, a crucial assignment in the farm-rich, sprawling rural district. He further angered many when he voted against the farm bill in 2013 and survived a close primary in 2014. Outside groups poured almost $3 million into the contest, mainly opposing Huelskamp, but conservative groups like the Club for Growth and Americans For Prosperity did come to his aid. Still, in the end it wasn't enough. \"Getting kicked off the Agriculture Committee is a crime that can't be forgiven,\" Brian Scheideman, a drivers education teacher in the district, told the Associated Press. \"I don't mind the independent voice, but you've got to figure out how to work with people.\" Huelskamp is just the third GOP incumbent to lose a primary this year, but the other two losses came in part due to redistricting. North Carolina Rep. Renee Ellmers faced a largely new district but also heavy conservative spending against her to become the first incumbent casualty of 2016. Virginia Rep. Randy Forbes also lost in a redrawn district. Pennsylvania Democratic Rep. Chaka Fattah also lost his primary as he was facing a 29-count federal indictment; he was later convicted and resigned.",

Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., during the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia.\n                \n                    \n                    Bloomberg/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption A delegate holds a campaign sign in support of Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., during the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. On Tuesday as Hillary Clinton's was officially nominated as the first major party female presidential nominee, women (and yes, some men) all over the Wells Fargo Arena in Philadelphia danced, cried, embraced and howled with joy. The Democratic National Convention erupted into a deafening celebration over a woman being thisclose to the presidency, 240 years after the U.S. was founded and nearly 100 years after women got the right to vote. And it was a show of unity that put her over the top, as her once-bitter rival Bernie Sanders called for her nomination by acclamation. But it wasn't all women who were rejoicing. Despite the Vermont senator's unequivocal endorsement of Clinton this week, many in the minority of his supporters continued pushing their candidate in spite of Clinton's win. During her acceptance speech Thursday night, scattered Sanders supporters clad in bright yellow, glow-in-the-dark shirts periodically chanted in protest and waved signs. For some of the delegates still supporting Sanders, the historic moment inspired not ecstasy but conflicting feelings. LaDawn Jones, a 36-year-old Georgia state representative, said it's exciting to elect a woman, but when it comes to Clinton being that women, she's ambivalent. \"It's historic, I have a daughter, I want her to be able to experience that. But for some reason, this election, that was not enough to make me a Hillary supporter,\" she said. Jones learned about Sanders last fall, when she read his autobiography. She said she identifies with him because she sees both Sanders and herself as political \"outsiders.\" And now that he has lost the nomination battle, she doesn't have as much enthusiasm for voting this fall. \"One hundred percent I will be voting for [Clinton] in November,\" Jones said. \"It's going to take me until November 7 at 11:59 to really get excited about it, but I'm going to vote for her.\" Clinton is very clearly making a gender-based appeal in this presidential election, leaning into her historic candidacy in a way she didn't in her failed bid eight years ago. This week's convention featured speeches from women House members and senators, Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards, a bevy of female celebrities, and the \"Mothers of the Movement.\" Her Tuesday live video appearance even referenced \"breaking the glass ceiling,\" as her \"entrance\" featured her shattering a panel depicting the previous 44 presidents. Clinton will surely carry the women's vote this fall \u2014 women have voted more Democratic in every presidential election since 1980, but this year could feature the widest gender gap in modern electoral history. That isn't necessarily because women are flocking to Hillary because of her gender; rather, many people (men and women alike) are voting for Clinton largely as a vote against polarizing GOP nominee Donald Trump. Similarly, she struggles to win over male voters from Trump. While many Sanders supporters are unenthusiastic about Clinton, she is still set to win most of their votes. According to a new report from the Pew Research Center, 90 percent of people who consistently supported Sanders said they favored her over Trump in the election. For those Sanders supporters Clinton hasn't won over, there is another female presidential candidate. Green Party nominee Jill Stein has actively pursued the Sanders supporters and shares their liberal views. And that's who Ryan Trundle, a shop foreman from Shreveport, La., will be voting for. \"Any woman would be awesome and amazing,\" he said, mentioning Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard and former Ohio state senator Nina Turner, a prominent Sanders supporter, as examples. \"This one, I would never vote for her,\" he said of Clinton. Many other Sanders supporters think similarly \u2014 they champion women in government, but they say they can't support this woman. \"I support women at all levels of office, but I'm most interested in voting for women who represent my views and policies, which is why I supported Bernie Sanders,\" said Jessa Lewis, a delegate from Washington state. Many delegates \u2014 Sanders and Clinton supporters alike \u2014 referred to their mothers or daughters or other women in their lives when talking about Clinton. And that means some Sanders supporters are experiencing the excitement, if only secondhand. They invoked the older generation of feminists when talking about Clinton's nomination. \"In my lifetime, I don't really remember a time when I didn't know I could be an astronaut. And even though there hadn't been a female president, I knew there could be. It wasn't a question of if, but when,\" said Sara Laird, a 37-year-old delegate from Gettysburg, Pa. \"But I realize it's a very different thing for my mom's generation,\" she continued, \"and I celebrate the accomplishment and their fight that they've done for me and my daughters.\" Laird declined to say how she would be voting in November. Washington state Sanders delegate Darin Brunstad also demurred, saying he would focus on down-ballot races. And though Sanders had lost, Brunstad said he appreciated how his mom must be feeling this week. \"I will say that my mother, who was very active in the early feminist movement, was a huge Hillary supporter,\" he said. \"And I know how proud she is at this moment, and I am very happy for her.\"",

Mike Pence joins Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump at a rally in Westfield, Ind., on Tuesday.\n                \n                    \n                    Michael Conroy/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Indiana Gov. Mike Pence joins Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump at a rally in Westfield, Ind., on Tuesday. Mike Pence, newly chosen as Donald Trump's running mate, has a strong following among social conservatives for his stands on Planned Parenthood, gay marriage and other hot-button issues. Less noticed are his ties to low-taxes, small-government conservatives. Pence has well-established connections to the politically powerful armada of tax-exempt groups led by the billionaires David and Charles Koch. The ties are deep. But so far, they don't seem likely to bring badly needed Koch money into the presidential race. Two years ago, Pence made a one-day trip to Dallas, for two quick appearances at the Defending The American Dream Summit, the annual grassroots convention organized by Americans For Prosperity. AFP is the primary front-line group in the Koch network, and this was just one of several appearances Pence has made at AFP events. \"The reason I got on that airplane and am standing before all of you today ... is to simply say thanks,\" he said in Dallas. When his tax-cut proposal stalled in the Indiana legislature, he said, \"AFP of Indiana at a critical moment in that debate came alongside our administration and informed the people of Indiana. And we put together an income tax cut and a tax cut package that was the largest state tax cut in Indiana history. And AFP made a difference.\" There's something of a revolving door between Pence's office and Koch offices. When Pence was in Congress, his chief of staff was Marc Short, who later became president of Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce. Freedom Partners serves a central office of the Koch network. Pence's congressional press aide, Matt Lloyd, went on to become communications director for Koch Industries. Then Lloyd returned to Gov. Pence as a deputy chief of staff. These connections have roots. Pence and the Kochs have inhabited the same political world since at least 1991, when he became president of the newly organized Indiana Policy Review Foundation. It was one of many state-level conservative think tanks, in a national network funded in part by Koch family foundations. None of this, however, seems likely to help the woefully underfinanced Trump-Pence campaign. The Koch network once expected to spend nearly $900 million in the election cycle. Not anymore. Most significantly, David and Charles Koch refused to back Trump for president. Instead, Koch network money and energy are going to protect the Republicans' vulnerable Senate majority. When the Trump campaign confirmed that Pence would be the VP pick, there was speculation that he could yet pry loose some of the Koch millions. Freedom Partners spokesman James Davis cut off the speculation with a terse email statement: \"We are not engaging in the presidential. Our focus will remain on the Senate.\"",

            "article_content": "Though Trump called off his news conference announcing his running mate, nevertheless he made his announcement right on time \u2014 on Twitter. In the tweet, Trump said his choice is the Indiana governor.  RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: Donald Trump went ahead and made his announcement on time. He had called off a news conference to introduce his new vice presidential nominee. Instead, he sent a tweet saying the choice is, in fact, Indiana Governor Mike Pence. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: So let's talk about this with NPR's Sarah McCammon. She covered the Trump campaign, and she's in New York. Hi, Sarah. SARAH MCCAMMON, BYLINE: Good morning, Steve. INSKEEP: And also NPR's Ron Elving senior editor and correspondent. He's in Cleveland getting ready for the Republican convention next week. Ron, good morning. RON ELVING, BYLINE: Good morning, Steve. INSKEEP: What does Pence bring to this ticket? ELVING: He brings the consistency of conservatism in both his manner and his ideology that many Republicans have found lacking in Donald Trump. That's a big contrast, but he also brings a lot of strong ties to Christian conservatives within the party, religious conservatives, also two party establishment figures, many of whom knew him when he was a pretty good-sized figure in the national Republican sphere in the House of Representatives and also to big donors, especially the kind of big donors who don't like Donald Trump or haven't given to him so far. INSKEEP: As someone who's followed him for a while, I feel like he's got a little different style than Donald Trump. ELVING: He has a very different style from Donald Trump he tends to come off perhaps a little bit preachy at times. He certainly is a consistent member, if you will, of the Tea Party and a consistent member of the religious factions of the Republican Party. None of those things has been associated too closely with Donald Trump. INSKEEP: Different positions? ELVING: Different positions as well. Donald Trump has pretty much said that the Iraq vote in 2003 was a major disaster going into Iraq with that war. Mike Pence supported that. Mike Pence is a major supporter of trade deals, including some of the ones that Donald Trump has most roundly condemned. And also Donald Trump has defended Planned Parenthood, and it was Mike Pence who put in the first bill in 2007 to defund Planned Parenthood. And there are many other differences as well. INSKEEP: Sarah McCammon, how does this choice compare with the things that Donald Trump had said in recent months about what he wanted in a running mate? MCCAMMON: You know, the main things he said, Steve, are that he wants someone who can bring leadership experience, help him govern to, you know, bring that to the ticket. And he's also said that he wanted somebody that essentially he likes and gets along with. For that reason, you know, people like Newt Gingrich and Chris Christie were - who've spent more time with Donald Trump were seen as possible picks. They seem to have chemistry. At the same time, Mike Pence certainly has executive experience as a governor and former experience in Congress, so he's someone that could, you know, help Trump in that way, help him work with Congress potentially. So, you know, ultimately there was a lot of speculation over the last 24 hours about what exactly was happening, whether Trump was having second thoughts. But it appears - well, he has told us he has gone with Mike Pence. INSKEEP: Let me ask, though, Ron Elving, before you govern you have to win. Trump is in a position where a Republican - any Republican candidate would have a challenge because the electoral map and other factors. Does Mike Pence bring aboard any voters, expand the base in any way for Donald Trump? ELVING: Perhaps not expand the target of the base - that is to say to not, perhaps, bring in states that they had not thought they could contest before. But he does solidify Donald Trump's claim on some of those Republican voters who, while they've been loyal, do not always turn out. And I'm talking here about Christian conservatives, religious conservatives, the kind of people who didn't vote for George W. Bush in 2000, but did turn out to vote for him in 2004. And Mike Pence is a Midwesterner, so it should help in some of those swing states like Ohio. INSKEEP: Sarah McCammon - a couple seconds - when will we see this guy or see the two of them together? MCCAMMON: They're expected to appear together tomorrow in New Jersey and possibly elsewhere, but we've heard from campaign sources in New Jersey, so that is, of course, the home of New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, who wasn't chosen. INSKEEP: OK. So we'll see how that goes. NPR's Sarah McCammon will bring us the latest on that. Sarah, thanks very much. MCCAMMON: Thank you. INSKEEP: And our senior editor Ron Elving is at the Republican convention in Cleveland where this program will be live next Monday and beyond. Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

So how did he get the nomination? The party simply failed to decide on anyone else, according to one political scientist. In the runup to this election season, The Party Decides seemed to be on every political science nerd's reading list. The 2008 book by political scientists Marty Cohen, David Karol, Hans Noel and John Zaller laid out how the invisible primary \u2014 party elites' behind-the-scenes machinations before primary season \u2014 plays a heavy role in shaping nominations. One big idea: When party members line up definitively behind one candidate (in the form of endorsements) during that invisible primary, that candidate wins. But the parties found themselves threatened this year. The GOP didn't decisively pick one person, but it quite clearly did not decide on Donald Trump. He received zero major GOP endorsements until well after the first primaries, and yet here he is, at the top of the GOP's November ticket. Likewise, Bernie Sanders always trailed Hillary Clinton by a long shot in terms of the number of endorsements, yet he gave her a tougher fight than almost anyone expected. We talked to Cohen about how he views the 2016 election \u2014 if it's changed how he thinks, as well as how parties could again strengthen their grips on nominations. Our Q&A is below (edited for length and clarity). Danielle Kurtzleben: As a political scientist, what about the 2016 election has changed how you think or challenged what you considered conventional wisdom? Marty Cohen: I think the extent to which politics has become celebrity-driven has just been epitomized and reached its logical conclusion in this election cycle. I remember 20-some years ago having some friends in D.C., and they either worked on campaigns or they were just going to school, and they were starting to take pictures with politicians. The extent to which celebrity ... has infiltrated politics is shocking to me, and the extent to which the mistruths and the falsehoods of the Internet have been mainstreamed into American politics. Politicians started to feel to me like celebrities. That was like 20 years ago, and I think we've just steadily continued that trend. And it's obviously epitomized in Donald Trump being the ultimate celebrity politician. The extent to which celebrity is prized in our society and has infiltrated politics is shocking to me. And the extent to which the mistruths and the falsehoods of the Internet have been mainstreamed into American politics, mostly through Donald Trump, but also through Carly Fiorina and her assertions regarding that Planned Parenthood video that never existed. Things that are very easy to debunk are gaining currency in politics, and we've lost the gatekeeper. We've lost the ability to have rational conversations based on facts, and falsehoods are just not checked. And so I guess that has surprised me that we've gotten to this point. And I think it's not new; I think it's been building. It's just kind of exploded this year. OK, so the logical follow-up to that is: How do we get out of it? The way you get out of it is if it results in disaster, and people are shocked into, \"This is not what we want for our country and for our politics.\" And sometimes you need like a shock to the system. And if Donald Trump were to be elected president, I think that could be a sufficient shock to sort of move us back toward \u2014 not necessarily to what was a noble past in politics, but clearly a time when there was some more collegiality, there was some more bipartisanship, there was some more realization that there were common problems that needed to be solved. And that you could trust that people were basing their views on facts. How to get out of it, I don't know. I mean, a lot of things have gone into this trend: polarization and ultrapartisanship. Some of it, we're not going to be able to put the toothpaste back in the tube. You can't get rid of the Facebook echo chamber, I guess. Yeah. And the proliferation of outlets, and that sort of thing. Gerrymandering is something, campaign finance, the fact that all these safe districts represent people who are more concerned with their extreme flank than with appealing to the center. That can be changed. And it certainly could change in some states. But I don't know if it would have the desired effect. So that's not clear what that sort of reform would be. So let's talk about your book. For the people who haven't read it, give us a quick summation. What do you mean by \"The Party Decides\"? We believe that the party consists of a group of what we call \"intense policy demanders\": people who want something out of politics and want policies. They pay attention to politics. They put a lot of effort into it. And they're looking for a return on their investment of time, effort and often money. One of the things that they do in order to try to assure themselves of getting favorable policy is to try to control their nomination. It's much easier to get a friendly candidate into office than to try to negotiate with someone who's already there. Parties throughout the years have always tried \u2014 through negotiations and compromises and conversations \u2014 to figure out which [presidential] candidate is most acceptable to the broadest range of the party factions. And once they've figured that out, they try to put their resources behind that person so that they can become the nominee and present a united front in the general election. You focus on the importance of endorsements. I'm wondering \u2014 Jeb Bush started out with a big endorsement lead, and Clinton did, too, but then she got a run for her money \u2014 does this year's election change how you think? First of all, on the Republican side, we collected the data now, and as far as endorsements are concerned, no one had a mass of endorsements. There was a very, very wide spread of endorsements between six or seven candidates. No one was at all close to being the runaway leader in endorsements. And compared with years past, very few people relatively were endorsing before Iowa. So the party largely sat on the sidelines on the Republican side. There's a number of reasons we think that occurred. But one thing for sure is that Donald Trump, the eventual nominee, didn't have any endorsements. So it wasn't that someone was the leader in endorsements and was overtaken and blown away by Donald Trump. There was no real party consensus at all this time around on the Republican side, in complete contrast to the Democratic side, where everybody was endorsing, and they were all endorsing Hillary. So that's the facts on the ground in terms of the endorsement derby. What this election cycle tells us is that parties try to unify behind a broadly acceptable candidate, but there's also the appeal of factional candidates. Donald Trump we don't think of necessarily as a factional candidate because he doesn't really represent a faction of the Republican Party, but he attracted a certain type of voter that is well-represented within the Republican Party. So maybe the GOP didn't line up behind one candidate, but it certainly seems like a lot of them lined up against another candidate, in the sense that people weren't endorsing Trump. Why didn't that stop him? I think you found that for the longest time, they didn't do anything really about it. They didn't start running ads against him until after Iowa. They didn't start coalescing behind other candidates until after Iowa. And while they didn't necessarily want Trump, they didn't make a concerted effort to stop him until it was too late. So is this year, with all of its outsider candidates, a one-off, or is it part of a pattern? We've had a few of these outsider or anti-establishent candidates in the past few years, aided by technology, like with Howard Dean and then Barack Obama, to a lesser degree. There's a real possibility that we're already into a different era ... that probably began in 2004. And like you said, Trump may be a little bit of a fluke of a candidacy. But Bernie Sanders has sort of continued the trend of online fundraising, online advertising, the ability to mount an insurgent campaign without party support. Obama was much less an outsider even than Sanders, in terms of insider support. Bernie Sanders greets supporters at an election-night rally on June 7 in Santa Monica, Calif.\n                \n                    \n                    Scott Olson/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Bernie Sanders greets supporters at an election-night rally on June 7 in Santa Monica, Calif. Right. Obama spoke at the [2004] convention. That's what parties do, is control the nominations. That's kind of their reason for being. But still, you're right. It's certainly [about] challenging the establishment favorite. The most recent cycles since 2000, which seemed to be the epitome of the, if you want to call it now, the old system, where [George W.] Bush and [Al] Gore racked up the endorsements and really sort of coasted to the nomination. Since then, you look at the Internet, you look at Fox News and the 24-hour news channels, and on the Republican side more recently, just the general fracturing, the inability to create consensus. The Democrats are much more of a consensus-based party right now than Republicans. Republicans have a lot of factions to them that are difficult \u2014 especially, the people that Trump appealed to already had splintered off as early as 2009, 2010, with the Tea Party phenomenon. And sometimes it's harder for parties to unify than it is in other periods. So if things are changing, and there is that growing ability to, as you put it, mount an insurgent campaign, does that weaken your theory at all? We still think we described that period of time pretty well. I don't think that it's unthinkable that we could return to another period of relative party insider control. The Republicans are going to, I think, make a big effort to not let something like this happen again. So you can forgive them for maybe not remembering what can happen if you let the voters decide, and they let the voters decide by being passive in the invisible primary, and they got what they got. There's calls on the Democratic side to make the process more open, and even on the Republican side, too. But there's going to be a lot of people looking at Donald Trump's nomination as a cautionary tale of what happens if you don't get your act together as a political party and try to control your nomination. So there could be a backlash to that. And you could see tighter insider control return, quite possibly. My inclination during this campaign has been to think, \"Man, parties are getting weaker.\" Do you think that's true? Parties definitely have gone through spells where they've been weaker and strong. You have progressive reforms in the 19th and 20th century that were designed specifically to weaken parties. But parties rebounded. And then the McGovern-Fraser [Commission] reforms of the late '60s and early '70s tried to take control of the nomination process and give it to the people. And for a couple of cycles, it was wild and crazy, and the voters were clearly deciding, and then the party readjusted. So I think you're right that the pendulum does swing. But that's what [parties] do, is control the nominations. That's kind of their reason for being. The original title of our book was \"Beating Reform,\" and that's kind of what we had in mind is that parties had beat reform in the 1960s and then kind of reasserted themselves. So are they going to be able to beat back technology and beat back media? Maybe they'll figure out a way to do that. It seems like the relationship between candidate and party used to be more symbiotic, whereas now, if I'm Donald Trump, maybe I can say, \"I don't need the Republican Party as much as I might have in, say, 1996.\" Or is it just that the Republican brand is that important? He might think he doesn't need the Republican Party, but all the criticism from the Republican Party is going to take its toll. The Republican Party at some point can cut bait, essentially, and let him go and focus on as best they can the House and Senate. In which case it would be very difficult for him to win \u2014 even more difficult than it might otherwise would be. But I think you do need the party apparatus. You need the party brand. And parties again are uniquely qualified to do certain things, and that is to win elections and mobilize voters and to set the agenda. So for him to go it alone essentially, I don't think that's a winning strategy. The way we're trying to think about it \u2014 we're working on a piece that we're going to be publishing in the fall \u2014 is there are incentives for parties to unify, and there's also a goal, an important reason to unify \u2014 to create party unity \u2014 but there are also incentives and pushes toward factionalism. And factionalism won on the Republican side this time. So maybe since 2004, it's harder for parties to unify around one particular candidate and shepherd them to the nomination.",

In the aftermath of the Orlando shooting \u2014 the deadliest in recent U.S. history, with 49 victims \u2014 calls for gun control have once again grown louder. In fact, they were shouted on the House floor on Monday. After Speaker Paul Ryan led a moment of silence, Democrats yelled, \"Where's the bill?\" at him, asking for new gun control measures. This isn't new. The word \"doomed\" has become a common adjective to describe gun control efforts. Mass shootings like those in San Bernardino, Calif.; Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn.; and Fort Hood, in Texas, looked like they might fuel efforts to tighten laws, but gun control advocates have found their efforts perpetually frustrated. Efforts to pass federal gun control measures often get a lot of press, but state and local laws also play a big part in determining how people can purchase and own guns. After the Colorado Planned Parenthood shooting last year, President Obama asked Congress, as well as state and local governments, to take action. The strictness of gun laws varies widely from state to state. We've put together state-by-state maps on some of the most important gun laws. Check out what nine types of gun-safety measures look like in your state, via data from the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence: The question of state laws' effectiveness regularly becomes a central point of debate after mass shootings. Florida's laws are the 28th strongest in the nation, according to the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence; on its gun law scorecard, it gives Florida an F. Hillary Clinton called out Florida's gun laws in a Monday speech responding to the shooting. California has the toughest gun laws in the nation, according to the Law Center, getting an A-minus. (You might notice that California is colored in on all of these maps.) And, of course, as the AP pointed out after San Bernardino, those tough gun laws \"failed to stop [a] mass shooting.\" That is one point that gun rights advocates point to after mass shootings as evidence that stricter gun laws aren't necessary \u2014 because they're ineffective. Many of the proposed gun control policies from President Obama and presidential candidates since San Bernardino wouldn't have stopped this particular attack, as the Washington Post's Philip Bump writes. But gun control advocates point beyond isolated incidents to broader trends, like data showing that tougher state gun laws are correlated with fewer gun deaths (a statistic that includes not only homicides and accidents but also America's many gun suicides). And to the degree that stricter gun laws keep gun ownership levels down, it could mean less violent crime. Several studies have shown a link between firearm ownership rates and the risk of being a homicide victim. In a 2015 study, for example, researchers at Harvard University found that higher levels of firearm ownership were associated with higher levels of firearm assault, firearm robbery and firearm homicide \u2014 when controlling for demographic factors like age and race. That study, and many others like it, show a link between gun ownership and crime or deaths, and, therefore, support the hypothesis that more guns mean more gun-related crime and death, though they do not establish causality. Though efforts to pass more gun control legislation have stalled at the federal level in the past few years, some Americans will vote on it at the state level next year. In November, measures requiring universal background checks (that is, checks for private and gun-show purchases) will be on the ballot in Nevada, and gun control advocates are hoping to vote on it in Maine as well. Editor's note: This post was originally written in December 2015 and was updated on June 14, 2016, to reflect the Orlando shooting as well as new data from the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.",

            "article_content": "The Supreme Court Monday punted on the constitutional merits of a religious freedom challenge to the Affordable Care Act. The court said it was feasible to satisfy religious groups and women seeking contraception and sent the case back to the lower courts.  AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: Today the U.S. Supreme Court avoided making a decision on birth control coverage for employees. This is the coverage guaranteed under the Affordable Care Act. Instead of resolving a clash between religious objectors and the law, the Court said there's the possibility of a compromise, so it unanimously booted the case back down to the lower courts. The justices gave instructions to take sufficient time for the two sides to work it out. To talk through what happened, NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg is in the studio. And Nina, if you had to write a headline for this story, what would it be? NINA TOTENBERG, BYLINE: The justices punted. You know, Audie, I don't want to be flip about this, but they said to the parties, you folks negotiate for now, and the appeals courts below can deal with this problem for now; and then you can come back here later - much later. CORNISH: So give us a little more detail. What was this case all about? TOTENBERG: Well, the Affordable Care Act, among other things, seeks to deal with one of the major health care costs for women - birth control. It requires all employers who provide health insurance to include free contraception coverage for their employees. Religiously affiliated nonprofits like universities, hospitals and charitable organizations can opt out by notifying either the government or their insurer of their objections. The government then works with the insurer to provide the coverage independently. The opt-out provision was added to the health care law as an attempt to accommodate the objections of some religious nonprofits, but it didn't go far enough for them. They contended that notifying the government or the insurer of their objections would make them enablers of birth control via a different route. They want to be completely exempt, to be treated the same way that houses of worship are treated, meaning that their employees and, in the case of universities, their students would have no birth control coverage. CORNISH: So those religious nonprofits that rejected this go to the court, and they lost in most places, right? TOTENBERG: They lost in 8 out of 9 appeals courts. But one ruled in their favor, so there was a conflict. And the Supreme Court agreed to resolve the issue. After the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, however, that turned out to be very difficult, and the court looked as though it might be headed for a 4 to 4 tie. Less than a week after the oral argument in the case, the justices floated a compromise idea - no written notification and a package of free birth control coverage from the same insurer. The court asked the two sides to file briefs responding to its suggestions. What it got back was less than totally enthusiastic, especially from the government which warned of important practical problems. Nevertheless, today, in an unsigned unanimous opinion, the court chose to treat those responses in the rosiest of fashions. The court then sent all the birth-control cases - and I think there are now 17 of them - back to the lower courts with the instruction to look for a way to better reconcile religious objections with the need to provide free birth control coverage for women who work at religiously affiliated universities, hospitals, charities... CORNISH: Wow. TOTENBERG: ...Et cetera. CORNISH: Sounds like a tall order. TOTENBERG: Uh-huh. CORNISH: So is there another agenda here? TOTENBERG: Well, probably there are many agendas. First is the court's desire to avoid a 4 to 4 tie which lets stand the judgment of the lower court, meaning that in this case, for instance, there would not have been one legal rule for the whole country. Another is Justice Anthony Kennedy, who would've been a fifth vote if he sided with the court's liberals in this case or, if he went the other way, a fourth vote for a tie. And he seemed very torn at oral argument. And third, this is an eight-justice court with a big, fat vacancy. And today's action ensures that nothing will be decided by the time of the election. CORNISH: Wait, so what does that mean - that really nothing will be decided before the election? TOTENBERG: Well, in the starkest terms, if Donald Trump wins, he says he'll fill the ninth seat with a conservative, and the court likely would strike down the birth control mandate as a violation of religious rights. If, on the other hand, the Democratic nominee wins, then the pendulum swings to women's reproductive rights and the government's right to legislate to protect women's health. CORNISH: So what did the court actually decide today? TOTENBERG: It was extremely explicit about that. It said it was deciding nothing. And in the meantime, the coverage continues as it is today. CORNISH: That's NPR's Nina Totenberg. Nina, thanks so much. TOTENBERG: Thank you, Audie. Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Heavily funded progressive organizations are coordinating a sustained effort to define apparent Republican nominee Donald Trump. They've been field-testing messages for months. Now they're primed to start filling the screens of TVs, computers and smartphones with hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of anti-Trump messages. At the hub of the effort is the main Democratic superPAC, Priorities USA Action. It expects to spend $125 million in TV and digital messaging from this month to election day. That's twice as much as it spent in 2012. \"Our focus is really going to be on Donald Trump himself,\" said Guy Cecil, co-chairman of Priorities. He listed three lines of attack: first, Trump's record on military and international issues; second, what Cecil called the businessman's divisiveness and \"carnival barking\"; and third, Trump's \"record of building his own fortune on the backs of people and ... the fraudulent claims that he has made about his business record and ... how he has treated the people around him.\" That last item echoes one of Priorities' best-known ads from 2012. Aimed at Mitt Romney just as he was being nominated by his party, the ad was narrated by Mike Earnest, a former worker at a factory that closed down after the company was taken over by Romney's private investment firm. \"Mitt Romney made over a $100 million by shutting down our plant, and devastated our lives,\" Earnest said. Cecil said the alliance with other progressive organizations is critical. \"It's something that, for the last 11 months, I've put a priority on,\" he said. That time frame means the work began well before Trump announced he was running. Priorities and other groups have been exchanging poll data and research and field-testing messages. This kind of coordination is legal because it doesn't involve the candidates or parties. This winter, Priorities and two other groups tested a batch of 15-second pop-up ads promoting Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton. In one spot, two 20-somethings, a woman and a man, worked at computers side by side. Over a light, syncopated rhythm track, a narrator said, \"When you find out that bro who has your same job gets paid more than you ... you give them Hill.\" One of Priorities' partners on the ad is the superPAC arm of EMILY's List, which supports liberal female candidates. The ad's target audience is young working women, whom EMILY's List is working to turn out on election day. \"If we do our jobs right and educate them on the stakes of the election, millennial woman could make up 20 percent of the overall voters in November,\" said Denise Feriozzi, deputy director of EMILY's List. Priorities also works with the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, where Executive Director Deirdre Schifeling said they aim to reach 3 million to 5 million voters. \"We will spend as much money as we can raise,\" she said. \"We feel like everything is at stake this year.\" Altogether, Planned Parenthood, EMILY's List and Priorities are out to spend roughly $175 million. Still, that doesn't seem like much in the context of the 2016 presidential campaign. \"We are preparing for, you know, upwards of $1 billion of spending against Hillary Clinton in the targeted presidential states,\" Cecil said. Those are just the seven or so states where the reputations of both Trump and Clinton will be trashed over the coming months.",

Donald Trump has called himself the presumptive Republican presidential nominee. But he can't become the real presumptive nominee without first gaining a lot of votes in the California primary on June 7 \u2013 the last day of voting on the GOP primary calendar. It's the first time in decades that California will make a difference in picking the GOP nominee. That's why all three remaining candidates will be speaking at the California Republican Party's convention, which begins Friday. California Republicans aren't used to all this attention. Just 27.6 percent of California voters are registered with the party. Though few in numbers, they may become mighty in impact. California will be Donald Trump's last chance to either win the delegates he needs to clinch, or fall short and fight it out at the national GOP convention in Cleveland in July. \"It's very exciting for California to actually have a voice,\" said Jim Brulte, the chairman of the state Republican Party.  Though California has become reliably Democratic in presidential contests, he says that the enthusiasm generated at this weekend's convention could have dividends for California Republicans down the line and down the ballot. \"Our delegates are very excited,\" said Brulte, \"and that will add to their encouragement, as they go back to their communities to work to rebuild our party from the ground up.\" There'll be about 1700 office holders and grass-roots activists at the state convention. Donald Trump will kick off the proceedings Friday with a lunchtime speech. But considering his criticism of the war in Iraq, his blaming the Bush administration for 9/11, and his occasional kind words about Planned Parenthood, he's not necessarily the natural candidate for this crowd, according to Dan Schnur, the director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics at the University of Southern California. \"The Republicans who attend their state party convention are the truest of the true blue \u2014 or true red, I suppose, in this case. They are the most ideologically intense and the most ideologically extreme members of their party,\" said Schnur. Those delegates will hear from John Kasich at dinner on Friday. On Saturday, Ted Cruz will speak at lunch. Then the dinner keynote will be delivered by Cruz's recently-announced vice presidential pick (presuming he gets the opportunity to pick), Carly Fiorina. A group of GOP consultants has formed Victory California, the sole purpose of which is to deny Donald Trump the 1,237 delegates that would guarantee him the nomination. Veteran California political consultant Richard Temple, a co-founder of Victory California, said that there are a lot of opportunities for both Kasich and Cruz to pick up delegates in the state's primary \"because we are winner- take-all by congressional district.\" So Trump may lead by a wide margin in statewide polls, but in California's GOP primary it's not just how many votes you get, but where you get them. Each congressional district won by Kasich or Cruz means 3 delegates that Trump won't get. Trump has swept, or nearly swept, all of the delegates in many recent states that awarded them to the winners of individual congressional districts. But Temple insists that he and his colleagues have the upper hand in this fight, because \"we actually live and work here in California and know the state pretty well. We know these individual congressional districts; we know what kind of voters live there by their income level, education level, marital status. So it is a district-by-district effort across a very large state.\" Whatever the outcome on June 7, the competition on display at this weekend's state convention could help revive the fortunes of the struggling California Republican Party. But political analyst Dan Schnur said it's a double edged sword. \"On one hand, it's going to bring the party an amount of attention that it has not received in many years,\" said Schnur. \"On the other hand, the types of voters who Republicans need in order to become a competitive party in California once again are not the kind of voters who are going to be attracted to either a Ted Cruz or Donald Trump message.\" For California Republicans, that's a long-term issue. This weekend's forecast calls for delegates to enjoy the warmth of the national spotlight and a little love from their presidential candidates. But once the general election starts, they're unlikely to see much of their nominee in solidly blue California.",

The Supreme Court has ordered more legal briefs in the birth control case it heard last week, indicating that the justices are struggling to avoid another 4-4 tie. The case tests the religious liberty claims against the Obamacare mandate for birth control in all health insurance plans. Some faith-based nonprofits \u2014 like hospitals, universities and service organizations \u2014 object to signing an opt-out form on the grounds that that action triggers the insurer's providing birth control coverage separately. At the oral argument last week, several of the conservative justices said the requirement \"hijacked\" the religious employers' insurance plans, and a 4-4 tie seemed likely. In an apparent attempt to prevent a deadlock, the court on Tuesday afternoon asked the government and the religious objectors to address a specific question: whether birth control coverage for employees could be obtained without involving faith-based employers at all; and the court offered a specific suggestion for doing so. In an unusually detailed order, the court asked whether it would be possible to have objecting nonprofits notify their insurers that they do not want to have their plan cover contraception that they are opposed to, and upon receiving this notification, the insurer would separately notify employees that the insurance company will provide the coverage on its own. The additional briefs are to be filed by April 20. The government undoubtedly will have to consult with insurance companies to see what health plans can do without adding significant administrative costs. And one of the issues bound to concern the health insurers is where the requirement for separate coverage will end. For instance, what about religious nonprofits that object to blood transfusions, or vaccines, or numerous other medical procedures? Tuesday's order for more briefs likely stems from the concerns of Justice Anthony Kennedy, who was among those who called the Obamacare opt-out a \"hijacking \" of the religious objectors' plans at the oral argument last week. He seemed at the time to be grasping for an alternative; but if he is ultimately persuaded there is not a good one, he would likely join the court's four liberals and make a five-vote majority for upholding the current opt-out provision. If, on the other hand, he is persuaded there is a good alternative, the liberal justices could either join him or there would be a 4-4 tie. The result of a tie would be that in most of the country, where the opt-out provision has been upheld by the lower courts, the opt-out provision would be the law; but in the states governed by the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals, which struck down the provision, the opt-out measure would be voided. The states in the 8th Circuit are Arkansas, Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota and South Dakota.",

On the sixth anniversary of the enactment of the Affordable Care Act, the federal health law was back before a seemingly divided Supreme Court Wednesday. At stake this time is the controversial requirement that most health insurance plans provide women with access to contraceptives at no additional out-of-pocket cost. Specifically at issue is whether a special accommodation the Obama administration has provided for religiously affiliated employers (such as universities or hospitals) still violates a federal law protecting the free exercise of religion. Under the rules issued by the Obama administration in 2014, religious nonprofit organizations don't have to provide contraceptive coverage, but they do have to either fill out a government form or write a letter stating that they object and telling the government who their insurer is so the government can arrange for contraceptive coverage to be provided. The current case, Zubik v. Burwell, is actually seven cases being considered together. The plaintiffs, led by the bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh, argue that even the act of writing a letter makes them \"complicit in sin\" by enabling employees to obtain birth control coverage. \"My clients would like to be conscientious objectors,\" attorney Paul Clement told the justices. \"But the government is insisting they be conscientious collaborators.\" The liberal members of the court made it clear that they agreed with the lower-court rulings in the cases, all of which found that the requirements do not pose a \"substantial burden\" on the exercise of religion under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. \"It's not a substantial burden if someone else is going to do the action you object to,\" said Justice Sonia Sotomayor. Conservatives, however, seemed less convinced. \"Their objection is the government is hijacking their insurance plans,\" said Chief Justice John Roberts. Even though the religious employers do not have to pay for or directly arrange for the coverage, he said, the employers' insurance plans are \"being used by the government to provide these services.\" If the court deadlocks in a 4-4 tie, as seems possible, it could order the case to be argued again whenever there is a ninth justice to replace the late Antonin Scalia. Or it could issue a split decision that would uphold the appeals court rulings in question, but set no national precedent. This is not only the fourth time in five years the court has been asked to rule on a key aspect of the health law, it is the second time in three years it has taken up the so-called contraceptive mandate. In 2014, the court ruled 5-4 that the craft store chain Hobby Lobby and other closely held for-profit companies didn't have to provide contraception as part of their health insurance plans if they had a religious objection. The current case comes in the midst of an election campaign that could be affected by efforts to limit women's access to contraception and abortion. Poll results released Wednesday by the Kaiser Family Foundation show that more than a third of those surveyed (and 40 percent of women) said there is \"a wide-scale effort to limit women's reproductive health choices and services.\" (Kaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the foundation.) Not surprisingly, Democratic women were more likely than Republican women to say there is a widescale effort (56 percent vs. 25 percent) and far more likely to say that they are \"personally concerned\" about women's reproductive health choices (52 percent vs. 18 percent). The contraceptive case comes only weeks after the court heard a case from Texas that could limit women's access to abortion. Kaiser Health News is an editorially independent news service that is part of the nonpartisan Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation. Julie Rovner is on Twitter: @jrovner",

The organization, along with several others, argues that the government's workaround to provide free birth control still burdens its free exercise of religion. The rights of the religious and the secular clash again Wednesday at the Supreme Court, this time in the controversial context of Obamacare and birth control. The health care law sought to equalize preventive health insurance benefits between the genders. That meant free coverage of birth control for women, with an automatic exemption for houses of worship, like churches \u2014 but not for nonprofits like religious schools and hospitals. Those nonprofits were given a workaround to accommodate their objections, but some say that accommodation still burdens their free exercise of religion. There are cases before the court from all over the country. The plaintiffs range from large universities to small service organizations, among them the Little Sisters of the Poor, an order of Catholic nuns that runs homes for the elderly poor. The Washington, D.C., Little Sisters home has space for about 100 residents. A new facility, it is light and airy, and the atmosphere pretty joyous. At a recent visit, one of the nuns was playing tunes from The Sound of Music while about a dozen residents sang along. As the music changed to \"When the Saints Come Marching In,\" resident Alberta Wright, who is over 100 years old, gave a little shimmy as she danced with one of the sisters to lots of laughter. Though there are crucifixes everywhere, not all the residents or staff are Catholic. When it comes to providing birth control insurance coverage for the staff, the Little Sisters have a religious objection, and they believe that the workaround meant to accommodate that objection still makes them complicit in providing contraception for their employees. The government, in contrast, views the law as a reasonable accommodation. \"Anyone who has a religious objection ... doesn't have to pay for, refer, doesn't have to organize, doesn't have to accommodate that contraception coverage for his or her employees,\" says former Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius. \"What they are required to do is provide notification to the government or their insurer that they are opting out. That's it.\" The government then steps in to fill the gap, and along with the insurer \u2014 for example, Blue Cross Blue Shield or a third-party administrator \u2014 makes birth control available, without charge, to employees, dependents or students who want birth control coverage. Sister Constance Veit says she doesn't object to signing the required form or a letter. \"The religious burden is what that signifies, and the fact that the government would, you know, be inserting services that we object to into our plan, and it would still carry our name,\" she says. But just a few miles from the Little Sisters home is Georgetown University, an elite Catholic institution, where many of the students, faculty, staff and their dependents are not Catholic, and they want birth control coverage. Alison Tanner, co-editor-in-chief of the Georgetown Journal of Gender and the Law, helped put together a brief in the case filed on behalf of the estimated thousands of people on her campus who are currently getting birth control under the accommodation, but would not if the Little Sisters prevail in the Supreme Court.

(Left) A nun dances with resident Alberta Wright. (Right) Sister Constance Veit. Tanner notes that nationally 1.9 million students attend roughly 1,000 religiously affiliated schools, some of which object to birth control. As she sees it, requiring these institutions to opt out by notifying the government or the insurer of their objections does not impose much of a burden. \"The burden there is light,\" Tanner says. \"The burden on the woman who will not have insurance access to contraception is heavy without some form of workaround for the religious objection.\" Indeed, some 28 states impose much stricter requirements for birth control coverage. According to the Institute of Medicine, birth control is prescribed not just to avoid pregnancy but also to treat various female medical conditions \u2014 it is the most frequently taken drug for women ages 15-60. And it is expensive, $30 a month and more for pills, and as much as $1,000 for buying and having an IUD inserted. Nobody doubts the sincerity of the various objecting religious entities, but seven of the eight appeals courts that have ruled on the workaround have said it does not impose a \"substantial burden\" on religious rights, that it does serve a compelling interest in providing health care, and thus does not violate the federal law known as the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. In the Supreme Court on Wednesday, lawyer Paul Clement, representing the Little Sisters and other groups, will argue that the workaround is, in fact, a \"substantial burden.\" \"The government itself admits that they can't provide the services unless they get this necessary information from my clients,\" Clement says. \"When you force somebody to pay for somebody else's contraception, including forms of contraception that many religions view as abortifacients ... you are treading on religiously difficult territory.\" That's not what this workaround does, replies University of Virginia law professor Douglas Laycock, who has filed a brief on behalf of the Baptist Joint Committee for Religious Liberty. \"This is the only time in 30 years of filing briefs that I've ever filed on the government's side in a free exercise case,\" Laycock says. He acknowledges that \"the metaphysical objections in this case may matter to the objectors religiously; but in any practical sense,\" he says, \"this is the government's plan.\" \"The government instructs the insurer to deliver the contraception, instructs the insurer to deliver it with its own funds that are kept segregated from any premiums paid by the employers.\" Indeed, Laycock notes, the insurer can't even put birth control coverage information in the same envelope with other information. Those opposed to birth control argue that there are other ways to provide the insurance coverage without involving objecting institutions at all. Have a separate birth control package available on the Obamacare insurance exchanges, for instance. But Sebelius replies that no such program exists. \"Having only women in an institution have to go sign up for some totally different plan, which doesn't exist, is not funded and would require an act of Congress to put in place, would place ... a huge burden on women to try to take advantage of what is highly recommended reproductive health services,\" she says. Just two years ago, in another case, the Supreme Court seemed to suggest that the workaround created for religious nonprofits could be extended to some for-profit corporations. In this case, however, the court is being asked to eliminate the workaround altogether. A decision in the case is expected by summer. With only eight justices on the court at the moment, it is possible that there could be a tie vote. Were that to happen, under long-standing practice, there would be no court opinion, and the lower court decisions would be automatically left in place. Since all but one of the appeals courts to rule on the issue so far have ruled in favor of the workaround, that would mean that in most \u2014 but not all \u2014 of the country, the birth control workaround would be left in place, until a full nine-justice court definitively resolves the issue at some time in the future.",

            "article_content": "After Wednesday night's contests, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton have firmed up their front-runner status in the GOP and Democratic presidential contests.  AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: For others in the Republican establishment, Trump's success is a bitter pill to swallow. Now, for the big picture, let's turn to NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson. And, Mara, first, what happens next? I mean, does Donald Trump have the math? Has he wrapped this up? MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Well, he hasn't wrapped it up officially. He needs 1,273 delegates to do that. He doesn't have it, but it is getting harder and harder to stop him. There are only two weeks left until Ohio and Florida vote. Those are the two big winner-take-all states. And if they establishment, the anti-Trump forces want to stop him, the most they can hope for is to deny him the 1,273 delegates he would need to get the nomination on the first ballot at the convention. After the first ballot, delegates are unbound, and then there would be a contested convention. But for that to happen, John Kasich has to win his home state of Ohio handily. Marco Rubio has to do the same in Florida, even though Donald Trump is leading in the polls in Florida right now. CORNISH: So who's in the best position to beat Trump? LIASSON: Well, if you listen to the remaining candidates, they're all in the best position, if only the other guys would drop out. And that's the problem. It's in their collective interest of defeating Trump if everyone unifies behind one candidate, but neither Kasich or Rubio or Cruz have any individual incentive to do that. And that theory that the anti-Trump votes would coalesce behind one person is not accepted by Donald Trump, who says that, when candidates drop out, he gets some of their supporters, too, and that has been the case. Just today, Ben Carson announced that he sees no path to the nomination for himself. He won't be at the Republican debate tomorrow. It's not clear where his small chunk of votes go. But of all the candidates, you'd have to say that Ted Cruz has the strongest case to make just based on math. He's won four states - Iowa, Alaska, Oklahoma and Texas. Rubio's only won one - Minnesota. Cruz is closer to the base of the party than Rubio, and even Lindsey Graham, who is a supporter of Jeb Bush, said yesterday maybe it's time to unify behind Cruz. And that's a bitter pill also for the establishment. They don't like Trump, but they also don't like Cruz. As one leading conservative intellectual said to me who doesn't like either Cruz or Trump, he said, given the choice between Stalin and Hitler, I'll take Stalin, meaning Ted Cruz. CORNISH: OK, subtle. So just to remind people - correct that number. It's 1,237, right? That's the magical number. LIASSON: I'm sorry, 1,237 - that's what I meant. CORNISH: But this gets to the point - why didn't the establishment actually unify earlier? They wouldn't be in this position otherwise. LIASSON: Well, that's one of the eternal questions about this primary. Part of it was a failure of imagination. They just couldn't imagine that Trump, who was so outside the traditional bounds of an acceptable Republican candidate, could win. And there was never a strong enough anti-Trump to rally around. But also, this is a democratic process. The Republican voters are choosing a nominee, and close to 40 percent of them are choosing Trump. He is the Republican Party right now. He's winning with the kind of broad coalition that Republicans who go on to be the nominee tend to get. CORNISH: And we just heard from Congressman Collins, basically telling people to get over it, but are they ready to get on the bandwagon? LIASSON: Well, not all of them. There are a lot of senators - Republican senators up for reelection who are wondering, if Trump is the nominee, how do they separate themselves from him without alienating his supporters? They need - some of them need college-educated women, who are turned off by Trump. And Mitch McConnell said recently that he would drop Trump like a hot rock. That's just not so easy to do. CORNISH: This feels like a turning point. Can you talk about what it means for the future of the GOP? LIASSON: Well, that is a huge question, and you cannot underestimate the anguish and pain a lot of Republicans feel right now. It's hard to be a Republican establishment member. And here's someone about to be, perhaps, the nominee who disagrees with all these basic, bedrock beliefs about health care, about Putin, about Planned Parenthood, about entitlements, about free trade, about immigration. It is an existential moment for Republicans. And when you talk to them, you hear talk about maybe they should form a third party. Maybe the GOP will break apart. Maybe it will lose then regroup. Maybe Trump will win. Then what? I think one thing we know is the party won't survive as we've known it, which is with a business-backed elite with - and blue-collar, downwardly-mobile, angry base that somehow coexist. Those days are over. CORNISH: That's NPR's Mara Liasson. Mara, thanks so much. LIASSON: Thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, prays with a group of supporters after a rally earlier this month in Las Vegas.\n                \n                    \n                    Jae C. Hong/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, prays with a group of supporters after a rally earlier this month in Las Vegas. The crux of Ted Cruz's campaign has long been mobilizing the Christian right to his side, working to galvanize enough evangelical voters to topple Donald Trump. The Texas senator even launched his campaign at Liberty University, which claims to be the world's largest Christian college, declaring that \"God isn't done with America yet.\" Cruz talks with the cadence of a megachurch pastor, and exhortations of his faith are a mainstay at every campaign rally. His strategy in targeting the most conservative religious voters worked in Iowa, but the wheels came off in South Carolina and Nevada. Now, if he can't fully convert religious voters in many critical Southern states set to vote on Super Tuesday, his campaign could be beyond resurrection. \"I think for him to continue to lose evangelical votes to Donald Trump is a fatal blow to the rationale for his campaign,\" said Bruce Haynes, a GOP strategist and president of the bipartisan consulting firm Purple Strategies. \"He speaks openly of the relevance of his candidacy in churches and has openly identified that a key part of their winning strategy is evangelical voters. That's his base, but he's not carrying that base.\" Cruz Battling Trump And Rubio For Evangelical Voters The so-called SEC primary runs through states that are likely to have even more evangelical voters than the states that have voted so far. Cruz himself has only raised expectations about Super Tuesday, calling it \"the most important day in this entire cycle.\" According to 2012 exit polls, in Alabama 80 percent of GOP primary voters described themselves as evangelical. In Tennessee, 68 percent of Republican voters were born-again Christians. And in Georgia, 68 percent of primary voters four years ago were evangelicals. Those states could have higher evangelical turnout than states that have already voted this year, according to 2016 exit poll data. In Iowa, 64 percent of GOP caucusgoers were evangelical, while in South Carolina 72 percent described themselves as born-again. Those numbers were up from four years ago. Super Tuesday states could see a record number of voters, including more evangelical voters, go to the polls. With a heavy ground game, Cruz won 34 percent of evangelical voters in the Hawkeye State; Trump got 22 percent, while Florida Sen. Marco Rubio captured 21 percent. In South Carolina, though, Cruz finished third behind Rubio and lost the evangelical vote to Trump by 6 points, 33 percent to 27 percent. Rubio again got almost a fourth of that voting bloc though. Now, just hours away from Super Tuesday, polls show Cruz's grasp on evangelical voters slipping away from him even more. And it's complicated by a rising Rubio, who is now getting nearly as much of the evangelical vote as Cruz is in some places. \"Cruz is basically splitting the evangelical vote with Trump, and Rubio's getting a share of that too,\" said Alan Abramowitz, a professor of political science at Emory University in Atlanta. NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Marist polls released Sunday showed Trump easily beating Cruz in Tennessee and in Georgia. In Tennessee, that's fueled by a 15-point edge for Trump among white evangelicals and, in the Peach State, the bombastic billionaire is winning those voters by 8 points. Cruz does have a lead over Trump in his home state of Texas in those same surveys and wins evangelical voters there by 23 points. The biggest loss for Cruz could come in Alabama, a state where 80 percent of GOP primary voters four years ago identified as evangelical. A Monmouth University poll released Monday showed Trump winning 42 percent of voters, while it was Rubio in second with 19 percent followed by Cruz with 16 percent. The split of evangelical voters in that survey follows the same trajectory \u2014 43 percent for Trump, 18 percent for Rubio and 15 percent for Cruz. The Texas senator got another blow on Sunday when Alabama's senior senator, Jeff Sessions, endorsed Trump over him. Cruz has frequently invoked his work and relationship with Sessions on the trail, particularly on immigration. But the hard-line conservative chose to throw his support behind Trump, and not his fellow senator. Cruz's Trust Issue But Cruz's plan to woo evangelical voters hasn't gone as planned. He is not just losing the critical voting bloc to a thrice-married casino mogul who until a few years ago supported the abortion procedure known as intact dilation and extraction and has even defended Planned Parenthood this year \u2014 he has also seen his own reputation take a hit as rumors of dirty tricks have plagued his campaign. First, it was his staffers telling voters that neurosurgeon Ben Carson was set to drop out on Iowa caucus night, fueled by a CNN report saying his GOP rival was heading home to Florida after the vote. There have been misleading mailers and ads in South Carolina that the campaign has taken heat for; a superPAC supporting him even had to take down a misleading TV spot that hit Rubio. And some voters in the Palmetto State said the label of \"liar\" that his opponents were trying to paint him with was sticking. \"If Cruz doesn't win any of these contests outside of Texas, I think that's a really big sign for his campaign,\" Abramowitz said. \"The lying charges have clearly hurt him, and also the fact that he has no support from any of his colleagues in the Senate is hurting him.\" Cultural Vs. Committed Evangelicals Even if Cruz does lose born-again voters on Super Tuesday, that doesn't mean Trump has somehow converted even the most faithful to his side. Top leaders in evangelical churches have denounced his rhetoric banning Muslims from coming into the U.S. and his refusal to say he has ever asked God for forgiveness. Still, he has received the support of Liberty University President Jerry Falwell Jr., and Robert Jeffress, pastor at First Baptist Dallas, has introduced Trump at many rallies and spoken very highly of him, though he hasn't officially endorsed. It's important to remember that the seeming wide swath of evangelical voters who will go to the polls is not homogeneous, either in political or in religious beliefs. And defining what exactly constitutes an evangelical voter can be misleading in polling. A Vox study this month noted that \"regular, weekly church attendance \u2014 as measured by a standard Pew Research question included in my survey \u2014 predicted a statistically significant and substantive opposition to Trump.\" That's an important distinction, especially in the South, where church and religious activities are ingrained in the culture, but degrees of devotion vary. \"In the South, there aren't that many people willing to answer the phone and tell a live human being they're not born-again. After all someone in the room might be listening,\" said Haynes. \"The culture of the South is replete with people who've answered an altar call and qualify as born-again, but 20 years later it would be difficult for them to demonstrate how they're living an evangelical, Christ-centered life,\" he continued. \"They're Christian by definition, but it's not the central driving force of their life.\" It's those, maybe more tepid believers whom Trump has tailored an appeal to, with his bombast against illegal immigrants, America's weakness abroad and promise to restore the country's greatness. And in the South, it's that type of voter who will dominate the contests on Tuesday, likely denying Cruz his last prayer of a campaign resurgence.",

            "article_content": "Ted Cruz, R-Texas, bows his head in prayer before speaking at a campaign event.\n                \n                    \n                    Charlie Neibergall/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Ted Cruz, R-Texas, bows his head in prayer before speaking at a campaign event. Ted Cruz needs an awakening among his religious base for a strong showing or a surprise win on Saturday in South Carolina. In any other year in the GOP primary, the Texas senator, who talks of his faith with ease and frequently reiterates that he will defend religious liberty, might have the state's sizable evangelical vote sewn up. The voting bloc was crucial to his win in Iowa earlier this month, and religious conservatives make up an even larger share of the South Carolina Republican electorate. But much to his frustration, Cruz is still competing with Donald Trump \u2014 the thrice-married billionaire with no problem cursing on the campaign trail \u2014 for white, born-again Christians. And the mudslinging between him and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio that has enveloped the race's final hours may also be denting Cruz as his rivals try to paint him as a liar. Can Upstate Drive Up Cruz? In the race's closing days, Cruz has been hitting the part of the Palmetto State that could make or break him \u2014 the heavily conservative, evangelical Upstate, which could hold as much as 40 percent of the state's primary vote. Solidifying that region helped Newt Gingrich pull off a win in 2012. But it's also not a silver bullet to victory \u2014 Mike Huckabee carried the area in 2008, but Fred Thompson got enough of the vote to help John McCain to victory. McCain had strong showings in the less religiously focused Midlands and Lowcountry regions. Cruz's best path to victory or at least a strong second-place finish runs through the Upstate. He knows it, and that is why he is barnstorming the region. On Wednesday, he held a rally at a private Christian school in Spartanburg before addressing a faith gathering at a Southern Baptist church. Glossy videos shown before Cruz's early evening event at Oakbrook Preparatory School showed people praising his faith and trust in Jesus Christ. North Carolina Rep. Mark Meadows took the stage, telling the audience to loud cheers that \"there's a God who still reigns over the affairs of nation\" even amid much political uncertainty in the world. And Iowa Rep. Steve King introduced Cruz, saying he was someone who had been \"spoon-fed the Bible.\" Cruz took the stage with his usual televangelist cadence, preaching about his tough stances on immigration, history of standing up to Washington and promise to defund Planned Parenthood and return the country to the Christian principles he says it was founded upon. \"There is an awakening and a spirit of revival that's sweeping this country,\" he tells the crowd. David Barry of Fountain Inn, walking out of the rally with a red hat emblazoned \"JESUS,\" came away converted. He had been leaning toward the Texas senator, but after that impassioned speech was now \"fully committed.\" \"I like the way he mentioned his 7- and 5-year-old daughters and how he wanted a better future for them,\" Barry said. \"I liked the way he knew 2 Chronicles 7:14 in his heart\" \u2014 a verse that says, \"If my people who are called by my name humble themselves, and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and heal their land.\" As to whether Trump could fulfill that same promise if elected, Barry is doubtful. \"I don't think he has the character or the morals to really lead our country in the right way,\" he told NPR. And Barry predicted that polls showing Trump was still winning the state's evangelical vote were wrong. Cruz On Trump's Heels In Final Hours A new NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll conducted by Marist, released Friday morning, showed Cruz had slashed Trump's 16-point lead last month to just a 5-point advantage. But in the Upstate, Trump was still leading him by 4, and the real estate mogul still had a 3-point edge among white evangelical Christians statewide. Republicans in the state point to Cruz's strong ground game and data targeting that helped him turn out voters in Iowa, which could make the difference in a very close contest. In the past week, following the unexpected death of Justice Antonin Scalia, Cruz has added a new argument he hopes can move those numbers even more \u2014 he's the only trusted conservative in the race who can appoint reliable Supreme Court justices. When he took the stage later Wednesday evening at the Faith & Freedom Forum at First Baptist North Spartanburg, Cruz spent the majority of his time talking not just about his own faith but about how that faith led him to argue cases that protected religious monuments. He explained how he would make sure to appoint justices who would not legislate cases on marriage and abortion from the bench. \"If you want a Republican who will stand unapologetically for marriage and life, I'm the only person on that stage who has a proven record of doing so over and over again,\" Cruz said. \"Religious liberty has been a lifelong passion for me.\" Cruz was just one of two candidates who addressed the packed sanctuary. Neurosurgeon Ben Carson spoke earlier; Rubio and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush sent surrogates on their behalf; but Trump and Ohio Gov. John Kasich didn't send anyone. Democrats were also invited but didn't attend. Phil Tittle of Campobello was one of the attendees. He had decided on Cruz a while ago but also said he admired Carson, though he thought he wasn't ready to be president yet. To Campobello, it still didn't make sense how Christians could cast a ballot for the often vulgar Trump, and he predicted many would come back to the fold before Saturday. \"I think the message Donald Trump had before spoke to the anger and frustration of the mainstream Republican Party, which is leaving the people,\" Tittle said. \"But they're finding out who he is, that he's a person with no moral compass. I think they're finding out the message of Ted Cruz, and he's catching on.\" Rubio Vs. Cruz \u2014 When A Handshake Isn't What It Appears But it's not just Trump that Cruz has to persuade religious voters to not be swayed by \u2014 Rubio, too, is making a play for a share of evangelical voters. In the final days in the Palmetto State, the two campaigns have been feuding over ads from Cruz's campaign that attack Rubio on immigration reform. And on Thursday, Rubio's campaign attacked Cruz after his campaign posted a digitally altered image of Rubio and President Obama shaking hands on a website comparing the Florida senator's record to the president's. All that comes on the heels of charges Cruz has still been trying to dispel after the Iowa caucuses that his campaign staffers had spread incorrect information that Carson was dropping his campaign, trying to sway last-minute support to the Texas senator. Haley Grau of Spartanburg was at the church event and had heard the Iowa rumors, saying it made her question whether Cruz was the best representation of the GOP. But after hearing Cruz speak Wednesday night, she walked away giving him a new look. \"I came in here with my mind made up\" for Rubio, Grau said, \"and to be honest, I'm not so sure right now. I really have some thinking and praying to do after tonight.\" She added, \"I thought his opinions were strong; he laid out his law history very well, and I thought that he really addressed the Justice Scalia issue and some practical ways he could get some justices confirmed. I came in here not giving Cruz the time of day, and now I've really got to think about that.\"",

Ted Cruz speaks at a rally Tuesday in Anderson, S.C. After Donald Trump threatened to sue Ted Cruz for defamation over an ad he's running on Trump's past support for abortion, the Texas senator had one message for the billionaire businessman: Bring it on. \"I have to say to Mr. Trump, you have been threatening frivolous lawsuits for your entire adult life,\" Cruz said at a press conference at a Hampton Inn in Seneca, S.C. \"Even in the annals of frivolous lawsuits, this takes the cake.\" The ad in question is one from the Republican's campaign that shows clips of Trump, in a 1999 NBC Meet the Press interview with late moderator Tim Russert, saying he is \"very pro-choice\" and would not ban partial birth abortion. Cruz reiterated they will not pull the ad, and in fact will now begin airing it more frequently in the Palmetto State. In a letter sent by Trump's lawyer to the Cruz campaign, attorney Jeffrey Goldberg of Belkin Burden Wenig & Goldman LLP writes that the attack ad \"is not only completely disingenuous, but replete with outright lies, false, defamatory and destructive statements and downright fabrications which you fully know to be untrue, thereby exposing you and the Cruz campaign to liability for damages and other tortious harm.\" Cruz, an experienced litigator, was in his element as he made the case against Trump's claims in a winding press conference, using a table as a trial bench and other exhibitions showing Trump's past donations to Democrats. \"It is a remarkable contention that an ad that plays video of Donald Trump speaking on national television is somehow defamation,\" Cruz argued. \"The operative words in that ad come from Donald Trump's own mouth. And I understand if a candidate has a record like Donald Trump's, how he could consider anyone pointing to his actual words being defamation.\" \"Any first year law student can tell you, in a defamation case, truth is an absolute defense,\" he continued. Cruz reveled in Trump's threats, saying he would enjoy trying the case himself if such a lawsuit comes to fruition. \"One of the things I look forward to most of all is deposing Donald Trump. For that particular endeavor, I may well not use outside counsel \u2014 I may take the deposition myself,\" Cruz said. \"And I will say this, whether in a deposition or a court of law, getting Donald Trump under oath, under penalty of perjury, answering these questions \u2014 well, I'll point out it didn't work out so well for Bill Clinton.\" The rancor between the two GOP rivals, whose longtime detente ended last month, has ratcheted up ever since the campaign came to South Carolina, a state famous for its political mudslinging. The two traded barbs in a debate last Saturday, and Cruz also seized on Trump's comments that \"Planned Parenthood does wonderful things.\" The beginning of the press conference was akin to a trial argument from Cruz, trying to expose Trump's liberal record, and the Texas senator also had a poster of donations the real estate mogul had made in the past to top congressional Democrats, particularly pointing out his donations in 2006, the year Democrats recaptured control of Congress. \"Donald Trump is a direct cause of Obamacare passing, because if either house had remained in Republican control, Obamacare would never have passed, and Donald helped fund the Democratic takeover of both houses of Congress,\" Cruz argued. In the wake of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia's death this weekend, Cruz also said examining Trump's record and what type of justices he would appoint takes on a new importance. He pointed to Trump's statement last fall that his sister, federal appeals court Judge Maryanne Trump Barry, could be a good pick for the high court; Trump has said he was joking with that comment. But Cruz doubled down on Barry as someone who has an \"extreme leftwing record on abortion.\" Trump fired back with his own mocking statement, reiterating his threats and again bringing up the possibility of taking to court Cruz's very eligibility to serve as president since he was born in Canada. \"He is a liar and these ads and statements made by Cruz are clearly desperate moves by a guy who is tanking in the polls- watching his campaign go up in flames finally explains Cruz's logo. I am pro-life and I do not support tax payer funding for Planned Parenthood as long as they are performing abortions. I have been clear about my position on this issue for years,\" Trump said in a statement. \"If I want to bring a lawsuit it would be legitimate. Likewise, if I want to bring the lawsuit regarding Senator Cruz being a natural born Canadian I will do so. Time will tell, Teddy.\" Cruz didn't just turn his fire at Trump in his press conference, though. He also aimed at Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who has accused his campaign of dirty tricks in the closing days, ranging from push poll allegations and saying Cruz's campaign was behind a fake Facebook post that Rep. Trey Gowdy was switching his support from Rubio to Cruz. \"Marco Rubio is behaving like Donald Trump with a smile,\" Cruz shot back.",

            "article_content": "South Carolina is known for its rough and tumble politics, and Saturday night's CBS News debate in Greenville, S.C., certainly held true to that characterization. It was the most vicious and unruly debate yet this cycle, prompting moderator John Dickerson to even interject at one point that he was \"going to turn this car around!\" Real estate magnate Donald Trump and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush sparred early on about 9/11 and George W. Bush's foreign policy, with Trump using what are usually Democratic attacks on the former president in going after him for the Iraq war and his inability to prevent the September 11th terrorist attacks. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz threw elbows over immigration reform and Trump got in some jabs against Cruz, his frequent foil, too. Here are some of the top moments and takeaways from the debate. GOP candidates: Don't let Obama replace Scalia The sudden death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia on Saturday afternoon and subsequent opening on the bench started the event on a somber note, but quickly turned to the political question at hand \u2014 should President Obama be allowed to nominate a new justice in an election year? All the candidates sided with GOP congressional leaders, who said earlier that any nomination to fill Scalia's vacancy should happen under a new president, putting them at odds with Democrats and the White House. \"I think it's up to [Senate Majority Leader] Mitch McConnell and everybody to stop him,\" Trump said. \"It's called delay, delay, delay.\" Ohio Gov. John Kasich decried the partisanship in the country, saying he would bring the country together as president. But he admitted that, \"I believe the president should not move forward, and we should let the next president decide\" on a replacement. Rubio said a new GOP president should appoint someone who would \"put people on the bench who understand that the constitution is not a living and breathing document \u2014 it is to be interpreted as it was originally meant.\" Cruz sparred with Dickerson over whether or not a Supreme Court nominee had been confirmed in a presidential election year before. Dickerson corrected him, saying that in 1988, Justice Anthony Kennedy had been confirmed, though he was nominated the previous year. \"Obviously the war in Iraq was a big, fat mistake\" Then, something happened that no one expected in a Republican primary debate \u2014 the party's frontrunner went on a scathing attack against the previous GOP incumbent over national security. \"Obviously the war in Iraq was a big fat, mistake,\" Trump thundered when he was asked about his own foreign policy. \"They lied \u2014 they said there were weapons of mass destruction.\" His attack on George W. Bush was met with loud boos from the crowd in Greenville, S.C. \u2014 a state where the former president still remains very popular \u2014 and provoked a strong defense of his brother from Jeb Bush. \"I'm sick and tired of Barack Obama blaming my brother for all the problems he's had,\" the younger Bush said. \"While Donald was filming a TV show, my brother was busy keeping us safe.\" Trump jabbed back that Bush didn't keep the country safe: \"The World Trade Center came down during your brother's reign, remember that.\" \"On behalf of me and my family, I thank God all the time it was George W. Bush in the White House on 9/11 and not Al Gore,\" Rubio interjected in a rare moment of defense toward Bush. \"The World Trade Center came down because Bill Clinton didn't kill Osama bin Laden when he had the chance to kill him.\" Trump was repeatedly rattled The outspoken reality TV star has faded into the background at some recent debates \u2014 something that probably helped more than hurt him. But tonight he was front and center, and not in a good way. It was more than just his tiff with Bush over 9/11. The two later tussled again when Bush pointed out the bankruptcies Trump's companies had filed for \u2014 and Trump kept interrupting and talking over both Bush and Dickerson, calling Bush a liar and saying he personally never filed for bankruptcy. When he asked by Dickerson about his profanity, Trump defended his use of often vulgar language as something he did \"on occasion, in order to sort of really highlight something.\" And he added that previously when he'd been bleeped out for allegedly using the F-word, he had not actually said it. Using another odd strategy from last week, Trump again attacked the audience when they booed him when he went after Bush and also insulted South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, a former presidential candidate. \"That's Jeb's special interest and lobbyist talking,\" the boisterous billionaire said as he tried to explain away the jeers. When Cruz attacked him for supporting Planned Parenthood \u2014 which he fired back at him calling the Texas senator \"the single biggest liar\" \u2014 Trump then did say supportive things about the group reviled by Republicans. Trump reiterated that while he didn't support taxpayer funded abortions, the women's organization does do \"wonderful things having to do with women's health\" \u2014 another frequent argument by Democrats. One of the more puzzling moments was when Trump brought up \u2014 unprompted \u2014 his support for eminent domain, something that's put him at odds with many Republicans and has been a frequent point of attack from his GOP rivals. Overall though, Trump was thrown off his game and was on the defensive for most of the night. He's ahead in the polls in South Carolina, but debates have changed the course of the race there before and could again. Rubio vs. Cruz: \"He doesn't speak Spanish!\" There are big divides in the GOP on immigration, beyond just Trump's heated rhetoric and his repeated exhortations that Mexico will pay for his vaunted border wall. Cruz and Rubio had the biggest dust-up on immigration of the night, with the Texas senator again pointing out what many see as the Florida senator's Achilles heel \u2014 his onetime support for the Senate's comprehensive immigration reform bill. \"In the state of Florida, as speaker of the house, he supported in-state tuition for illegal immigrants,\" said Cruz. \"In addition to that, Marco went on Univision in Spanish and said he would not rescind President Obama's illegal executive amnesty on his first day in office.\" Rubio's retort: \"Well, first of all, I don't know how he knows what I said on Univision because he doesn't speak Spanish.\" Cruz responded by unleashing on a tear in Spanish. But Rubio had an opening and took it, painting Cruz as unethical and hitting him for suggesting on the night of the Iowa caucuses that Ben Carson was dropping out of the race. Overall, the Florida senator, who had a disastrous debate just a week ago, had a much stronger performance this Saturday night, which he badly needed to stay alive in South Carolina. Kasich wants to be the adult in the room: \"This is just nuts, OK?\" The Ohio governor wanted you to know on Saturday night he's a uniter not a divider. Kasich, who surprised this week with a strong second place finish in New Hampshire, repeatedly spurned the infighting that was enveloping him on stage, exhorting his rivals to calm down and come together. \"I think we're fixing to lose the election to Hillary Clinton if we don't stop this,\" he said, somewhat exasperated, at one point. When asked by Dickerson to weigh in on the Bush/Trump spat over 9/11, Kasich channeled what many people at home were probably thinking: \"This is just nuts, OK?\" Kasich is trying to keep running a positive campaign \u2014 something he's credited for his Granite State win \u2014 but that's becoming harder to do in such a negative, bitter race. \"Look, the bottom line is the people of this country and this state want to see everybody rise, and they want to see unity, and I don't want to get into all this fighting tonight because people are frankly sick of the negative campaigning,\" he argued. But in a year where voters are angry and it's that frustration that is fueling the rise of an outsider like Trump, can Kasich's sunny message or unity work? It will be hard. Carson faded even further on stage As he has been in nearly every recent debate, the retired neurosurgeon was a non-factor. He got more questions earlier on than usual, but he repeatedly used them to jump in and answer a question ... from 15 minutes ago. When he was asked about whether he was capable of handling \"2 a.m. phone calls\" in the White House \u2014 he instead rewound back to further expound on his answer about the Scalia vacancy and the need to end lifetime appointments. When he was asked about how he would deal with ISIS, he decided to weigh in on the Iraq war tiff between Bush and Trump. And his rambling answer on his tax policy was cut off by Dickerson telling him, \"I'm sorry we have to go to a commercial. The free market wants what it wants.\" Carson was once the rising outside candidate, but that was months ago. He finished last among the current field in New Hampshire, and if he does poorly again in South Carolina, a state his candidacy and message should have a broader appeal, it will be even harder to make a rationale for his candidacy.",

Here, the Republican presidential candidate thanks his supporters Tuesday outside the polling place at Webster School in Manchester, New Hampshire. Who will drop out after losing in New Hampshire? Possibly no one. (On to South Carolina! This race is still wide open! We can win this thing!) We'll consider the real reasons to stick around in a moment. But for several candidates, whether they make it official or not, the Granite State will be the rock on which their ships ran aground. Their campaigns may stagger on into a zombie phase, but it will not affect the outcome of further proceedings. On the Democratic side, both Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton will continue on to the Nevada caucuses of Feb. 20, regardless of the outcome or the margins in New Hampshire. Sanders and Clinton will meet in Milwaukee for a debate on PBS Thursday night. Their erstwhile third wheel, Martin O'Malley, already suspended his bid after the Iowa caucuses, and two other long shots (Jim Webb and Lincoln Chafee) quit last year. The reaper is nearer in the Republican field. The end of the dream may come for any of six candidates who desperately need at least a respectable finish in New Hampshire. That is a hefty majority of the nine remaining Republican candidates who have appeared in at least one of the party-sanctioned, televised debates. For those Republicans who qualify for Saturday night's debate in South Carolina (which will air on CBS News), there is always a chance of turning things around in that state's vote on the following Saturday. In any event, there is a chance of being seen one more time. (If that is not enough incentive to stay in, candidates facing the prospect of campaign debt know they can raise money more readily while still running than after they strike the tent.) Not everyone may make it onto the CBS stage, of course, and some might scarcely be missed. Jim Gilmore, the former Virginia governor, has been in and out of the TV debates, and his campaign appearances have been limited. Having barely registered in Iowa, he has had little visibility in New Hampshire. He may think this will change south of the Mason-Dixon Line, but evidence for this is scant at best. Gilmore is more likely to join the ranks of Republicans who hung it up after Iowa: Mike Huckabee, Rick Santorum and Rand Paul. (It is worth remembering, too, that Rick Perry, Scott Walker, Bobby Jindal, Lindsey Graham and George Pataki all dropped out back in 2015.) But several other contenders who have been far more important to the real discussion may also be seeing the checkered flag signaling their final lap. Carly Fiorina, the firebrand former corporate executive, flirted with top-tier status in the early going and battled her way onto the main stage of the debates. But her over-the-top claims about Planned Parenthood, never substantiated, tied her to an issue that was losing altitude by the month. Fiorina tried to compensate with increasingly personal attacks on Hillary Clinton. Surefire applause lines in the debates, these sorties did not reverse her decline in the polls. She was excluded from the ABC debate the weekend before New Hampshire, and she is not expected to rise above single digits in Tuesday's vote. Republican presidential candidate Dr. Ben Carson speaks with members of the media after the GOP debate Saturday.\n                \n                    \n                    Matt Rourke/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Republican presidential candidate Dr. Ben Carson speaks with members of the media after the GOP debate Saturday. Ben Carson, the pediatric neurosurgeon, has also been losing ground in recent weeks. His share of time in the debates has dwindled as his poll numbers have drifted downward, generally since the Paris attacks on Nov. 13 shifted the issue mix to emphasize national security. In the last debate, Carson had less camera time than anyone on stage, less than half as much as the leaders. He also suffered some embarrassment when he could not hear his name called and failed to come on stage when introduced. The famous physician from Baltimore may look past a poor showing here to pin his hopes on South Carolina. Or he may bow to what looks inevitable. Chris Christie has been a major factor in New Hampshire, and it will be ironic if he fails to reach double digits or finishes below the top five in New Hampshire. Christie had his best debate of the whole six-month season last Saturday night, skewering rival Marco Rubio as a robotic speechmaker who had never made any real executive decisions. Republican Chris Christie of New Jersey has invested nearly his entire campaign on New Hampshire. A poor result will almost certainly effectively end his candidacy.\n                \n                    \n                    Robert F. Bukaty/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Republican Chris Christie of New Jersey has invested nearly his entire campaign on New Hampshire. A poor result will almost certainly effectively end his candidacy. If Rubio's rapid rise hits an air pocket in New Hampshire, it will be because of that surface-to-air strike from former prosecutor Christie. But it is entirely possible the benefit of that will go to other candidates, such as John Kasich or Jeb Bush, who had been polling closer to Rubio than Christie. Christie worked this state more than any other. He won the endorsement of the Manchester Union Leader and other opinion-makers but relatively little support in the polls. Without a competitive finish here in the north, it is hard to see how he revives his fortunes in the less friendly confines of the first Southern primary. Gilmore, Fiorina, Carson and Christie all seem to be \"on the bubble\" as the actual primary voting begins. But there also exists the possibility that one or two other Republicans will hit a pot hole at just the wrong time. John Kasich, the governor of Ohio, has campaigned in the Granite State as much as or more than any other 2016 hopeful. He has clearly found an audience here, and he has won some editorial backing as well. Late polls showed him making a move. If he were the only option aside from Donald Trump or Ted Cruz \u2014 or even aside from Trump, Cruz and Rubio \u2014 Kasich might well be in the sweet spot. But he is splitting that \"mainstream Republican\" role with several others, including two other relatively pragmatic governor types from the Eastern seaboard. Kasich may do well enough to stake a strong claim on the vice presidential nod. If he does not do well, such as in challenging for second place, New Hampshire may well be the end of his formal campaign for the top spot on the ticket. Jeb Bush might once have expected to have this day be a blazing victory, compensating for a lackluster showing in Iowa. But his finish in Iowa was less than lackluster, and his prospects here, while better, are far from blazing. As the scion of America's best-known Republican dynasty, Bush's realistic hopes of the Oval Office will not survive a second setback. A loss seems inevitable, but the actual percentage and place in the finishing order will matter a great deal. The first President Bush won here in 1988 and 1992, but the latter year saw him share the primary vote with his upstart right-wing challenger, Pat Buchanan. The second President Bush was embarrassed here in 2000, losing to Sen. John McCain by 20 points. But the other \"Bush Boys\" moved on in every case to a solid win in South Carolina, thus setting a sure course to the nomination. A win in South Carolina now seems well out of reach for Jeb Bush, who is not polling in the top three there. The last several days have been a kind of family reunion for the Bush clan in New Hampshire.  Bush has had his mother and brother here to campaign for him. The Bushes have also welcomed many veterans of previous Bush administrations as sober-minded, sensible surrogates. Older, more traditional New England conservatives may still feel more comfortable with a Bush than with Trump or the Tea Party heroes of the new Republican wave. But that alone may not be enough to lift Bush much past New Hampshire's threshold of 10 percent. Bush has vowed to press on to South Carolina regardless of the results here. But one has to wonder if this vow will hold if he fails to crack the top three or four in New Hampshire. Rumors have swirled of a reassessment coming after today's results are in. Trailing as he has in South Carolina, it is not clear where Bush would get his candidacy back on track before the Florida primary on March 15. And even that home field advantage may not be enough against whichever candidate is leading at that time, especially if it turns out to be Rubio, the Florida senator who was once regarded as Bush's prot\u00e9g\u00e9.",

In a little over a week, people will cast the first votes of this election \u2014 and, on the Democratic side, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders find themselves in a very tight race and stepping up attacks and changing tactics.  ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton are starting to make their closing arguments to Democratic voters in Iowa and New Hampshire right now. The first votes in the race for the presidential nomination will be cast in a little over a week. NPR's Tamara Keith and Brian Naylor are on the trail today. Brian's in New Hampshire with Bernie Sanders, and Tam is in Iowa, following Hillary Clinton's campaign. Welcome to you both. TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Thanks. BRIAN NAYLOR, BYLINE: Thank you, Robert. SIEGEL: And Tam, let's start with you. You've been following Hillary Clinton for a while now. The polls certainly show the two Democrats in an extremely close race in Iowa, and Iowa's very important to her. Have you heard a change in her message over the last few days? KEITH: She's certainly sharpening the comparison with Bernie Sanders when it comes to getting things done. She talked about his health care reform bill that he's introduced many times in Congress. She says it's never even gotten a vote. She also, at this event earlier today, questioned Bernie Sanders' call to normalize relations with Iran. She's painting him as an idealist, and in her speech, she had some new lines. She said his ideas sound good on paper but will never make it in the real world. Let's listen to that. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) HILLARY CLINTON: Now in theory, there's a lot to like about some of his ideas, but in theory isn't enough. KEITH: And then she goes on to say that she plans to get things done if she's president. And you can expect to hear these lines again, especially if you watch TV in Iowa or New Hampshire because her campaign was filming to make an ad. SIEGEL: And speaking of commercials, of ads, Senator Sanders is out with a new, very upbeat ad that might appeal to a certain demographic. Brian, tell us about this one. NAYLOR: Yes. It's a very positive ad. The soundtrack is pretty much entirely the song \"America\" those of us of a certain age remember from Simon and Garfunkel. Let's hear a little of that. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) SIMON AND GARFUNKEL: (Singing) They've all come to look for America. (CHEERING) SIEGEL: So the whole soundtrack - all we're hearing is the song. NAYLOR: Yeah, yeah. But you know, compared to the kinds of ads that we've been seeing, especially on the Republican side with a lot of dark images and fears of terrorism and shady figures crossing the border, this is very upbeat, very positive. But it - I think it's only going to be very limited shelf life. It's - it'll be aired in - up here in New England where the electorate is largely - the Democratic electorate is largely white. But I doubt very much it's something that is going to be aired in South Carolina or Nevada and some of the other states where the Democrats are much more diverse. SIEGEL: Well, this ad does not mention Secretary Clinton, but she's mentioning him a lot - Bernie Sanders, as Tam has noted. Is Sanders talking about Clinton at all? What's his message? NAYLOR: The only time he has mentioned Hillary Clinton by name is when he's talking about the Keystone Pipeline. He was asked about that today, and he said that unlike Secretary Clinton, it didn't take him a long, long time to come out in opposition to Keystone. He's traveling around New Hampshire today with an environmental activist, Bill McKibben, who's a writer and led the opposite to the Keystone. But other than that, his message largely sticks to his tried-and-true, the 1 percent and Wall Street and corruption and that sort of thing. SIEGEL: Sanders has McKibben on the road. Tam, does Hillary Clinton have any big names with her right now? KEITH: Well, at the first two events of the day, probably the biggest names were her local organizers and some volunteers who've been making a lot of phone calls. But the last event of the day has pop star Demi Lovato. It's at a - in a college town. And then later this week, there's just a huge list of big-name people coming to stump for Hillary Clinton. I'll just run through some of the names - Billie Jean King, Julian Castro, actress Jamie Lee Curtis, Cecile Richards, who's the head of Planned Parenthood, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand and actor Tony Goldwyn from the show \"Scandal.\" He plays the president. SIEGEL: OK. Tam Keith speaking to us from a moving bus in Iowa and Brian Naylor in Hooksett, N.H, thanks to both of you. NAYLOR: Thank you. KEITH: You're welcome. Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.

            "article_content": "Donald Trump says he speaks for the \"silent majority,\" which is a phrase with a long history in politics. Iowa voters supporting Trump discuss just what makes up the silent majority in 2016.  ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: The silent majority is a phrase with a long history in politics. And those two words have been used a lot on the campaign trail by Donald Trump. NPR's Sam Sanders recently asked Trump supporters want silent majority means to them. SAM SANDERS, BYLINE: Trump says it everywhere. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DONALD TRUMP: The silent majority, have you all heard that? (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: There was a word - two words that used to be used a lot called silent majority. They stopped using them. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: So you have a silent majority in this country that feels abused. SANDERS: At a recent Trump rally in Clear Lake, Iowa, I asked some Trump supporters to define the phrase. PATTY HUGHES: Silent majority are the people that mind their own business and don't depend on anyone else, don't expect anything from anybody, and they're just - they're kind of quiet. They don't go around bragging or they're not activists. SANDERS: That was Patty Hughes from Indianola, Iowa. Her husband Larry put it like this. LARRY HUGHES: They don't want anything free, but they don't want to be - stuff taken away from them either. And that's happening to us out here in the cheap seats. SANDERS: Others said the silent majority was all about fiscal conservatism or disapproval of things like Planned Parenthood and anger with government gridlock. But this feeling is not new. RICK PERLSTEIN: Well, first of all, it comes deeply from Richard Nixon's basic political orientation. SANDERS: That's Rick Perlstein. He's a historian who's written several books about conservatism, including one called \"Nixonland.\" Perlstein says Nixon really made the phrase popular in a speech on November, 3, 1969. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) RICHARD NIXON: In San Francisco a few weeks ago, I saw demonstrators carrying signs reading lose in Vietnam. Bring the boys home. SANDERS: Nixon said those protesters wouldn't change his mind on Vietnam. And at the end of the speech, he appealed to the rest of the country. NIXON: And so tonight, to you, the great silent majority of my fellow Americans, I ask for your support. SANDERS: Rick Perlstein says Nixon was afraid that antiwar protesters had entered the mainstream, so he wanted to set them apart. PERLSTEIN: The idea that there are two kinds of Americans, sort of the ordinary middle-class folks with the white picket fence who play by the rules and pay their taxes and don't protest. SANDERS: The thing about silent majority is that it said just as much about who was in it as who was not. PERLSTEIN: Black civil rights militants - it was feminists who were supposedly burning their bras, it was students who were smoking drugs, rock 'n' roll bands -  it was everything that threatened that kind of 1950s \"Leave It To Beaver\" vision of what America was like before everything went, you know, literally and figuratively to pot. SANDERS: A lot of Trump's supporters are older. Many of them actually lived through this. Perlstein also says the phrase silent majority can be racially coded. PERLSTEIN: To say majority is to say minority. And everyone knows what minorities are. There are people in America who are not white. SANDERS: I asked the Trump supporters in Iowa if they thought the phrase silent majority was just another way of saying good white people. They all said no. And George Davey said Trump represents anything but that. GEORGE DAVEY: People he hires - I'm sure he has a lot of people of ethnic backgrounds. SANDERS: I found Davey at his home in West Des Moines. He doesn't want to say who he's caucusing for, but he is a Trump fan. Davey thinks the phrase silent majority really isn't about race now. DAVEY: The reason why we're silent is because we're not allowed to talk. SANDERS: Davey thinks it's all about PC culture getting out of hand. DAVEY: My favorite thing about Trump is he wants to get rid of political correctness. It all started out as the anti-bullying thing where all the sudden, you can't say certain things that might offend people because you're bullying them. SANDERS: Davey says it's gotten to the point where you can lose your job or get sued just because of what you say. DAVEY: That is against the Constitution. SANDERS: Rick Perlstein, the historian, he says whatever people think silent majority means, it probably works because it's all about emotion. PERLSTEIN: The silent majority is always going to be a state of mind. It's a feeling. You know, it's a feeling of dispossession. And that feeling of dispossession can come about most dramatically in times when, you know, things seem to be changing, you know, when all that's solid melts into air. SANDERS: When all that's solid melts into air. If you look at it that way, it makes total sense that this so-called majority is angry. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: They used to call it the silent majority. I'm calling it the noisy majority because we are angry, and we are angry - we're angry at stupid people. SANDERS: And we may never know if Donald Trump's silent majority is actually the majority. But if he wins, that could be a clue. Sam Sanders, NPR News. Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.

Trump held his own through an evening of challenges from the FOX Business Network moderators and from six rivals with him on stage. There were plenty of slings and arrows all around, yet Trump did nothing to discourage his fans while watching his main rivals carve each other up. He even had a moment of thoughtful connection while defending his \"New York values.\" Sens. Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio slammed each other's records and impugned each other's integrity for one lengthy segment of the debate's final hour, going mano-a-mano in a blood-letting that may not help either in the long run. The debate lasted nearly 2 1/2 hours, testing the seven men who still have significant standing in national or early-state polls. They were making their last best-televised appeal until they meet in Iowa to debate just days before the caucuses in that state kick off the actual voting season on Feb. 1. Thursday's debate was held in Charleston, S.C., in the state that will hold its own early primary on Feb. 20. The event was held before a large, lively crowd, like most of the other Republican debates, and featured considerable cheering and even catcalls and boos. At first the crowd seemed to be behind Cruz in his duel with Trump, but it later seemed to be with Rubio when he went after Cruz. Cruz was the man on camera most often through the evening. The hardliner from Texas showed a bit of why he has made few friends in the Senate yet become a hero to millions of conservatives. Cruz was on the spot early because Trump has recently questioned whether Cruz's Canadian birth met the \"natural born citizen\" qualification cited in the Constitution. Relying on his mother's U.S. citizenship, Cruz usually dismisses such questions as a \"nonissue\" or a matter of \"settled law.\" But in this debate he raised a competing theory instead, saying \"the more extreme conspiracy theorists\" thought someone had to be born in the U.S. to parents who were also both born in the U.S. (a standard raised by very few and never applied to presidential candidates in the past). Cruz pointed out that neither he, nor rival Marco Rubio, nor even Trump himself could meet that strenuous a test. (Trump's mother was born in Scotland.) But by so doing, Cruz eluded the real question of whether he needed to have been born in the actual United States in order to be legally elected president. And once that issue had been raised by FOX Business Network anchor Maria Bartiromo, Trump was more than willing to respond to Cruz's attempts to sidestep it. \"That wouldn't work,\" he said. \"I was born here. Big difference.\" This was not the only clash between the two men who are leading in Iowa polls as well as in national soundings of the GOP. The moderators also raised Cruz's recent remarks about Trump having \"New York values,\" which had been an applause line for him on the hustings. Cruz spoke of \"socially liberal\" New York as a city obsessed with \"media and money.\" Trump came back, not with his characteristic aggression or bluster, but with a measured answer about the values by which his native state and city had rebounded from the attacks on Sept. 11, 2001. He said New Yorkers in those days and months earned the admiration of the world. Later, talking to reporters in what is called the \"spin room,\" Trump said, \"I guess the bromance is over,\" a reference to his falling out with Cruz after the two observed an uneasy truce in the earlier debates. Cruz had refused to join other candidates' efforts to take down the national front-runner, and Trump had returned the favor by holding his fire. But as Cruz has moved up, and moved ahead in Iowa, Trump has countered with the questions about Cruz's birthright eligibility. \"The Constitution hasn't changed,\" Cruz quipped. \"But the poll numbers have.\" Rubio, pouncing on Cruz much later in the debate, unleashed a flurry of attacks on a range of issues. Cruz had harkened back to Rubio's 2013 bill overhauling the immigration laws \u2014 a bill Cruz has called \"amnesty for illegals.\" Rubio noted several issues on which Cruz had changed his views or his stance, including the availability of green cards and legal status for immigrants in the country illegally, Trade Promotion Authority for President Obama, military spending levels and even the status of whistleblower Edward Snowden. \"He called Snowden a public servant,\" Rubio said. \"When I'm president if we can get our hands on him, Snowden will be prosecuted as a traitor.\" Cruz had a chance to rebut what he called \"at least 11 attacks\" from Rubio and said at least half of them were \"clearly false.\" But he spent his time primarily on answering the assertion he had favored lower military spending. Also going after Rubio was Chris Christie, governor of New Jersey, who at one point said he was going to answer a given issue because \"you had your chance Marco and you blew it.\" Christie also reprised a popular thrust he had made in earlier debates by referring to the Washington way of debating issues on the floor of the Senate, contrasting it with a governor's obligation to actually govern. Rubio had nettled Christie earlier by referring to issues on which he had supported Obama and for him \"sending a check to Planned Parenthood\" \u2014 the women's health organization that has been a target for the Republican candidates because it provides abortions. Christie flatly denied sending any money to Planned Parenthood, causing Twitter to come alive with reporters and others saying they had proof Christie did so in the 1990s. In response to a question from moderator Neil Cavuto about a 45 percent tariff on Chinese goods entering the U.S., Trump said the quotation was wrong. \"It's The New York Times, said Trump, \"they are always wrong.\" Cruz had earlier denounced The Times for its \"hit piece\" on the loan he received from the investment bank of Goldman Sachs at favorable terms to finance his bid for the U.S. Senate in 2012. Cruz's wife, Heidi, worked for the bank at the time, and he has said they used their own retirement accounts to pay for the campaign. Cruz called it \"a paperwork error\" that he reported the loan properly in one disclosure form but not another. Jeb Bush, the former governor of Florida, found several opportunities to assert himself, especially on the question of immigration. He went after Trump's proposed exclusion of all Muslims, saying it made it impossible to recruit and retain allies in the international coalition against ISIS. In fact, he said, he made the case ISIS is trying to make against the U.S. Bush had earlier called Trump's suggestion \"unhinged,\" and he stood by that on Thursday night. Less noteworthy than in any debate since the campaign began was Ben Carson, the neurosurgeon who surged to the upper ranks in the polls in the fall. Since the terror attacks in Paris on Nov. 13, however, as the campaign focus shifted to national security, Carson has faded. Recent turmoil in his campaign has included the resignation of his finance director, which was announced the day of the debate. The moderators turned to him last in the questioning sequence and Carson made a joke about needing to be awakened. Also somewhat marginalized was John Kasich who, like Christie, barely made the statistical cut to participate on the main stage. Four others who did not make the cut were invited to an earlier debate in the same location. Three participated: Mike Huckabee, Rick Santorum and Carly Fiorina. A fourth, Rand Paul, declined the invitation. Kasich was given regular questions by the moderators but was not engaged by the other candidates as much as Trump, Cruz, Rubio and Christie. That meant he could not get response time, or get involved in the back-and-forth that animated the evening. He spent his camera time reciting his accomplishments as a member of the House and as governor of Ohio since 2010.",

            "article_content": "As Donald Trump warns about the prospect of a \"rigged\" presidential election, he's getting some help from a conservative activist group. Project Veritas, which has carried out several damaging video sting operations, has posted videos in recent days purporting to show Democratic operatives bragging about inciting violence at Trump's campaign events, and appearing to detail how they could bus out-of-state supporters in to commit voter fraud. \"Once again Donald Trump was ahead of his times,\" campaign manager Kellyanne Conway told Fox News on Tuesday night. \"He's been talking about this for the last couple days.\" One of the operatives, Scott Foval, has been fired from his job at Americans United for Change, according to multiple news outlets. The second, Robert Creamer, has said he's stepping back from his position at Democracy Partners. Both firms have been doing political work for Democrats this year. Unaware that he was being recorded by a hidden camera, Foval appeared to walk through how operatives could commit voter fraud by shipping in out-of-state people to vote. \"You can prove conspiracy if there's a bus,\" he says at one point. \"If there are cars, it's much harder to prove.\" He also detailed how he and other operatives recruit and train people to protest Trump events and to try to draw Trump supporters into physical confrontations. \"There's a script,\" he says. \"Sometimes the 'crazies' bite ... sometimes they don't bite.\" \"It is not hard to get some of these a******* to pop off,\" Foval said at another point. \"It's a matter of showing up to want to get into the rally in a Planned Parenthood T-shirt, or 'Trump is a Nazi,' you know. You can message to draw them out, and draw them to punch you.\" Trump has regularly blamed disruptions and violence at his rallies on Democratic campaigns. During the primary, he often said Bernie Sanders' campaign was sending people to protest at his rallies. The videos are edited, and O'Keefe and Project Veritas have a history of selectively \u2014 and at times misleadingly \u2014 editing their videos. While they have previously posted raw footage, they have not done so with these latest stings. Another political operative who appears in the video says this is a case of misleading editing. Immigration reform activist Caesar Vargas wrote on Facebook that \"they just edited the video to distort the story.\" The video shows Vargas appearing to agree to a scheme that an undercover Project Veritas operative is pitching that would involve busing people from state to state in order to vote illegally. Vargas says, \"this is not going to happen this election,\" but appears to be open to the idea at another point in time. \"Can we make something special during midterm elections in 2017,\" he says. But it's not clear what Vargas is talking about here. Theoretically, he could be talking about any number of proposals floated during that meeting. \"Whatever I told this group is what I tell everyone in public: We fight for our family not for a political party,\" Vargas wrote on Facebook. \"They have a transcript of our conversation to confirm I told them that voting twice was illegal.\" The head of Project Veritas, James O'Keefe, has a long history of promoting conservative agenda items using hidden camera stings. He effectively shut down community organizing group ACORN in 2009 by posting videos of ACORN staffers offering advice on how to avoid taxes, among other things. ACORN had already been a conservative target, but in the wake of the videos Congress voted to freeze its federal funding. O'Keefe has targeted former U.S. Sen. Mary Landrieu, election officials in Michigan and New Hampshire, the Open Society Foundation and NPR. Still, the voter fraud bluster comes at a time when Trump is regularly claiming the presidential election is \"rigged\" against him as he falters in the polls. Trump has tweeted about voter fraud, and instructed supporters to keep tabs on voting in big cities like Philadelphia. Creamer's taped comments are much less inflammatory, but he has nonetheless stepped away from his firm, Democracy Partners. In a statement on Facebook, the group said it was \"the victim of a well-funded, systematic spy operation that is the modern day equivalent of the Watergate burglars. The plot involved the use of trained operatives using false identifications, disguises, and elaborate false covers to infiltrate our firm and others.\"",

Chuck Schumer (D-NY), center, joins Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV), right, and Senate Minority Whip Richard Durbin (D-IL), left, for a news conference following the weekly Senate Democratic policy luncheon at the U.S. Capitol on Sept. 7, in Washington, D.C. Congress had just one thing to do this month before it left town for its October recess. That was to keep the government funded past Sept. 30. But with just under one week left on what was supposed to be a straightforward task, there's still no deal in sight. There was a fantasy circulating the Senate last week \u2014 that senators would be able to wrap up business and head home three weeks early to get back to campaigning (the Senate had been scheduled to be in the first week of October as well). It was such a widely adopted fantasy, many senators had a ready explanation for why it wouldn't be worth sticking around for the rest of September after they got the spending bill done. \"I mean, I think doing anything else requires a high level of cooperation, which probably between now and November 8 isn't going to exist around here,\" said Republican John Thune of South Dakota early last week. Turns out there wasn't even enough cooperation to get out of town early. By Thursday afternoon, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid was dismissing any notion senators were rushing to leave the Capitol. \"We're in no hurry to go any place, okay? We have all a lot of time,\" said Reid to a gaggle of reporters. By the end of the week, negotiations in the Senate were deadlocked. Even in the peculiar world of government spending bills where questions like, \"Will the bill run through December or next March?\" count as suspenseful, the intensity of this deadlock wasn't something senators seemed to expect just weeks ago. Where things stand now? Reid and Democrats in both chambers say the latest offer by Republicans is a no-go. So far, the only things both sides can agree on are: keeping the government open through December 9, and providing emergency aid to fight Zika without restricting funds for Planned Parenthood. It was progress, but the latest Republican proposal also contains flood aid for Louisiana and other states \u2013 without providing any aid for the water contamination crisis in Flint, Mich. Democrat Chuck Schumer of New York says that is unacceptable. The question is, they want to put Louisiana in, and we said you can't put Louisiana in unless you put Flint in. Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) on reaching a deal with Republican over flood victims versus victims of lead-contaminated water \"The question is, they want to put Louisiana in, and we said you can't put Louisiana in unless you put Flint in,\" said Schumer. But treating these disasters as inseparable offends Republicans like Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, who says the people in Flint can be taken care of after the election. Flood victims in Louisiana, however, cannot wait that long. \"We shouldn't hold folks who right now still have mud in their house and are thinking of throwing the keys to their house on the table of their banker, because they can't afford their mortgage, hostage to other peoples' grief,\" said Cassidy. There's also a squabble over a provision that would prevent the Securities and Exchange Commission from forcing companies to disclose political spending \u2014 it's current law, but Democrats want it out. Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas was leading the push for provision that would preserve U.S. control over a non-profit that oversees the Internet domain name system. But the most recent version of the spending bill proposed by Republicans didn't include it. We're going to have a no drama moment here \u2014 a low drama \u2014 there's never no drama here. We're going to have low drama. House Speaker Paul Ryan Yesterday he released a following statement, appealing to his colleagues in the House to continue the fight: \"I am grateful for my Senate colleagues' vigorous support during this debate,\" Cruz said. \"I encourage my colleagues in the House to continue to stand united to ensure that the government funding bill prevents the Obama administration from permanently undermining free speech on the Internet.\" The next procedural vote on the spending bill is scheduled for next Tuesday afternoon in the Senate. It remains to be seen whether a deal can be reached with Senate Democrats before then. Meanwhile over in the House, Speaker Paul Ryan tried to sound reassuring. \"We're going to have a no drama moment here \u2014 a low drama \u2014 there's never no drama here,\" Ryan told reporters on Thursday. \"We're going to have low drama.\" Or, so he hopes. Ryan will need House Democrats to get this bill through because many conservative Republicans have already said they're voting no.",

            "article_content": "Congress returns Tuesday after a seven week recess and will face an end of September deadline to fund the government and prevent a shutdown. Lawmakers will also have to decide how to fund efforts to combat the spread of Zika. And all of this must be done in an election year where some Congress members face tough re-election battles of their own.  AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: Congress is back today after a seven-week summer break, but blink, and you may miss lawmakers. Next month they'll disappear from Washington again in order to campaign. Between now and then, they'll have to figure out how to avoid a government shutdown and how to fund the public health battle against the Zika virus. With us to talk about all this is NPR's congressional correspondent Ailsa Chang. Hey there, Ailsa. AILSA CHANG, BYLINE: Hey, Audie. CORNISH: So of course we're in an election year. Please tell me there is not seriously a threat of a government shutdown. CHANG: (Laughter) Probably not, especially with the government funding deadline being so close to the elections - September 30. It's really in everyone's interests to get a spending bill passed with as little drama as possible. But you know, then again, this is Congress, and there could still be a fight. CORNISH: OK, (laughter) then again, this is Congress, is not good enough answer. CHANG: (Laughter). CORNISH: What would the fight actually be about then? CHANG: Actually it would mainly be about how long the spending bill runs. It's definitely going to be a short-term measure, but right now a group of conservative House Republicans want that measure to last six months into late-March of next year. What they don't want is a shorter-term measure that would expire mid-December of this year. And the reason any of this makes any difference at all is because if Congress passes a spending bill that lasts only through mid-December, it would mean lawmakers would have to pass another spending bill before President Obama leaves office. And what many House conservatives fear is that that would lead to a flurry of last-minute deal making and concessions to the president while everyone's scrambling to leave for the holidays. The Senate Democratic leader, Harry Reid, said he wants a measure that would last only into December and that he wants that bill to contain funding for Zika. CORNISH: Now, I want to talk more about that Zika funding because lawmakers have been fighting over this for months, and it seems like the situation here in the U.S. has not necessarily improved in that time, right? CORNISH: I mean how... CHANG: Right. CORNISH: ...Will Congress resolve this impasse? CHANG: Well, there's hopefulness on both sides. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention just announced that the 20 - the $222 million they've been using to deal with this will be depleted by the end of September. Then again, we've been hearing about the urgency of Zika funding since President Obama requested emergency aid back in February. That was seven months ago. Lawmakers have been fighting about it ever since then. And now they say they want to come up with a solution in just under four weeks. So we'll see if that happens. I mean the main problem Democrats have with the current Zika bill which has already failed to pass more than once is that it prevents Planned Parenthood from getting any of the funds provided. They accuse Republicans of playing abortion politics during a public health emergency, and Republicans are accusing Democrats of doing the exact same thing. CORNISH: And as we talk about this, of course Florida is a state that has concerns about Zika with cases appearing there - Florida, a battleground state. Has it become a campaign issue? CHANG: It sure has I mean certainly for Republican Senator Marco Rubio who's defending his seat down there. The thing is, Rubio has actually voted for every Zika emergency aid package that the Senate has considered, including one that would have provided the full $1.9 billion the president originally asked for. But now pro-choice groups are dumping a ton of money into the race to run ads against him, and they're making issue of an answer Rubio gave last month when he was asked whether women with the Zika virus should be allowed to get abortions. He basically said no, that he would err on the side of life. And now opponents are using that against him in relation to Zika. CORNISH: That's NPR's congressional correspondent Ailsa Chang.

            "article_content": "After a 7-week summer break, Congress returns to Capitol Hill. Lawmakers are scheduled to spend the month of September on a very short to-do list before leaving again ahead of November' election.  RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: Let's get a look at what's ahead for Congress. Lawmakers are back in Washington today after a seven-week summer break. And they're scheduled to spend the month of September on what NPR congressional reporter Susan Davis describes as a very short to-do list before Election Day. Good morning. SUSAN DAVIS, BYLINE: Good morning, Renee. MONTAGNE: What is on the agenda this month on that very short list? DAVIS: Well there are two things lawmakers have to pass this month and one thing they are trying to avoid. They must pass a funding bill to keep the government running before the end of the month, and they must pass a separate funding bill to combat the spread of the Zika virus. What many lawmakers are trying to avoid is a potential showdown over an impeachment vote for the commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service. MONTAGNE: Impeachment - let's get to that in just a few moments. First, let's talk about the budget because lost in the hullabaloo around this election is the fact that Congress is hurtling towards the deadline to fund the government. The fiscal year ends September 30, and yet we don't seem to be hearing anything about a government shutdown. DAVIS: Well, it's an election year, so there's almost no chance there will be a shutdown. That's certainly not the way Republican Party leaders want to go this year. But there is going to be a fight over how long they should fund the government for. Some conservative Republicans want to punt this funding bill into next year. They want to do this because they want to prevent Barack Obama from having any final legislative achievements before he's out of office. Senate Democrats aren't going to let that happen. It's more likely Congress this month will pass a bill to keep the government running until the middle of December, and then they'll come back after the election to fight it out. MONTAGNE: And Zika funding has been delayed for months. How are they going to resolve that impasse? DAVIS: There is a $1.1 billion bill on the table, but Democrats oppose it because it excludes Planned Parenthood from the list of providers that are eligible for funding for contraception to help combat the spread of the Zika virus. Democrats want to rework that provision. It's unclear how they're ultimately going to resolve it. But I spoke to aides in both parties who say they are absolutely confident they will work out a deal before the end of the month. Congress is facing increasing pressure to get it done, which is when it gets things done. The head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned lawmakers last week that they're almost out of money. And there's also increasing political pressure to act because one of the states hardest hit by the Zika outbreak is Florida, a critical battleground state. MONTAGNE: Well, Susan, let's get back to that impeachment fight. You say lawmakers are trying to avoid it. DAVIS: That's right. So there is a small faction of conservatives in the House who want to vote on an impeachment resolution of the IRS commissioner. His name's John Koskinen. This is part of that ongoing fallout from the 2013 IRS scandal, where the agency was targeting certain political groups, especially conservative groups, who were seeking tax-exempt status. Koskinen wasn't there at the time, but he's made a lot of missteps in his dealings with Congress, and he's really infuriated a lot of conservatives. But most Republicans are reluctant to have an impeachment fight weeks before an election. And many of them don't believe that Koskinen has met the threshold of committing high crimes and misdemeanors that would trigger impeachment proceedings. MONTAGNE: Though it does sound like this is getting in the way of maybe more pressing congressional business. DAVIS: Right. But if conservatives are committed, there is potential for a very dramatic political showdown this month that could tie up September at a time when party leaders were hoping for a quick entry and a clean exit. MONTAGNE: NPR congressional reporter Susan Davis, thank you. DAVIS: Thanks, Renee. Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Hillary Clinton has not held a single press conference since the start of 2016, triggering charges that she's trying to duck questions from reporters on the campaign trail. Clinton and her senior campaign aides say that's absurd. They have pointed repeatedly to what they call the swiftly growing number of interviews she has granted. In late May, for example, Clinton told CNN's Jake Tapper she had already done nearly 300 interviews. Last Sunday, campaign manager Robbie Mook told CBS's John Dickerson, \"She's been in more than 300 interviews with reporters this year alone.\" A review by NPR of those numbers suggests those claims by the campaign were at once true and somewhat misleading \u2014 some were conducted by unlikely questioners, and overall she favored local radio and national TV hits over granting interviews with national reporters covering her on the campaign trail and with print publications. In preparing an earlier story on Clinton's lack of press conferences, NPR set out to secure a tally of all those interviews from the campaign, as other database searches proved incomplete. In early August, the Clinton campaign agreed to share a tally of all of its interviews from the start of the year through the end of July. NPR sifted through the list, made minor corrections after conferring with the campaign, and analyzed the results. Among the network's findings: Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill, who provided the database to NPR, did not take issue with the network's conclusions when they were shared with him. The range of those interviews includes some unlikely questioners, such as: Then again, a strategy of reaching out to unconventional media outlets is no longer unconventional for politicians. The president whom Clinton hopes to succeed, Barack Obama, appeared on the programs of the comedians Ellen DeGeneres, Zach Galifianakis and Jerry Seinfeld. And Trump granted interviews to the right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and the industry magazine The Hollywood Reporter, among many other outlets. Other findings: Six years ago, Philippe Reines, an adviser to then-Secretary of State Clinton, emailed Jake Tapper, then with ABC News. Tapper had complained of failing to land an interview with Clinton while two rivals did. \"They were 10 minutes each,\" Reines wrote to Tapper. \"You would have wanted at least twice as long and spent half as much on the topic we were pushing.\" Jon Delano, the political director for KDKA, CBS' Pittsburgh station, has interviewed Clinton twice this year \u2014 once during the height of the state's primary season, and the other time right after the Democratic national convention. His state and his region are considered vital swing state territory. Notoriously, she hated doing Sunday show interviews. Betsy Fischer Martin, former \"Meet the Press\" executive producer Nonetheless, Delano had just three minutes the first time. He asked Clinton about fracking and gun control, issues that matter both to western Pennsylvania voters and to the national electorate, with little opportunity for follow-up questions. The second time, Delano interviewed Clinton for 8 1/2 minutes, pressing her on what she was willing to do to create jobs in the coal and steel industries. \"The more time you give a local journalist, the more airtime you will receive on that local station,\" Delano told NPR. \"In Secretary Clinton's case, you get a little tap on the shoulder from an aide that basically indicates that your time is up.\" The national reporters who trek throughout the country to report on Clinton daily were among the least likely to secure interviews, a sore point for many. Clinton has entertained questions a dozen times in so-called gaggles with the reporters who travel with her. Only in rare moments does she grant them individual interviews. Clinton also participated in nine town-hall sessions from Jan. 1 to July 31, at which she took questions from journalists and members of the public. Merrill, the Clinton spokesman, told NPR the campaign remains attentive to campaign reporters' concerns about access and press conferences. Highlighting the interviews, Merrill said, \"does not say we do not listen to or take seriously any feedback, particularly from the traveling press corps who know us best.\" During one of her longer conversations, with Politico's Glenn Thrush for his podcast in early April, Clinton revealed some of her thinking about the reporters who cover her. \"Once you get to a national press position, like yours and the others that are traveling with me, you're really under, in my impression, a kind of pressure to produce a political story,\" Clinton told Thrush. \"A headline,\" Thrush offered. \"That's your job,\" Clinton said. \"A headline, right? I totally get it.\" Clinton said by contrast she picked up valuable clues about a region's concerns from talking to local reporters. \"They will actually say, 'Well, you know, this is a problem that we're having. What do you think about it?' \" Clinton said. \"So there's actually a conversation that goes on.\" Betsy Fischer Martin, who was executive producer of the NBC Sunday public affairs show Meet the Press for 11 years, says Clinton was always a reluctant guest on her program. \"Notoriously, she hated doing Sunday show interviews,\" Martin says. \"And it was very difficult to get her booked on the show during many periods when she was secretary of state, when she was a U.S. senator, when she was a candidate. It was always a big effort to get her to come on and do a long sit-down interview.\" Clinton appeared 22 times on the five major Sunday public affairs shows so far this year, a review of transcripts shows. Trump appeared nearly twice as frequently. Martin tells NPR she was a bit surprised by how many television interviews Clinton had given. However, Martin noted that Clinton faced a far more difficult than expected challenge in the primary season from Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders this spring. In April, ahead of the Pennsylvania and New York primaries, Clinton called in to Ebro Darden's morning show on Hot 97, a hip-hop radio station in New York City. It was a relatively lengthy conversation \u2014 about 15 minutes long. And it afforded her a receptive forum in which to address comments she had made in 1996 as first lady that had recently resurfaced. Clinton had called some young criminals \"super-predators.\" Such talk carries a racial charge for many African-Americans. And Clinton used her time to reassure Darden's listeners that she shared their concerns. \"She does interviews when it suits her,\" said Martin, who now hosts a podcast for Bloomberg Politics. \"When they have a message that they want to get out there, they have a point they want to make, then she will do interviews.\"",

Tim Kaine counted health care policy among his chief concerns at a campaign rally for Hillary Clinton in Miami on July 23. As he takes the stage Wednesday night at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine is firmly in Hillary Clinton's camp \u2014 and his party's \u2014 on the big health care issues. Now a U.S. senator from Virginia, Kaine supports the Affordable Care Act and pushed its Medicaid expansion. He also worked to overhaul the mental health system when he was governor of Virginia. Here are highlights and a few flashpoints of controversy from Kaine's health policy record: Mental health A defining moment in Kaine's tenure as governor was the 2007 mass shooting at Virginia Tech, where 33 people, including the gunman \u2014 a student at the school \u2014 died. Almost exactly one year later, Kaine signed a $42 million legislative package to overhaul the state's mental health system. The money was used mostly for emergency mental health services, children's mental health services, increased case managers and doctors and jail diversion projects, according to the Virginia Office of the Attorney General. \"Somebody shouldn't be imprisoned because we won't provide funding for community mental health,\" Kaine said at a mental health conference in 2008, shortly after the bills were signed, according to the Virginian-Pilot in Norfolk. The package of laws made it easier for authorities to commit someone having a mental health crisis into treatment involuntarily. They no longer had to prove the patient was in \"imminent danger.\" Instead, the new standard only required authorities to demonstrate a \"substantial likelihood\" that the person could cause serious harm to himself or others. Together, Kaine and the state's General Assembly made a down payment on longer-term reforms for the delivery of mental health and behavioral health services in Virginia, says Peter Cunningham, a professor of health behavior and policy at Virginia Commonwealth University. Abortion As a Catholic who worked with Jesuit missionaries in Honduras in 1980, Kaine says he opposes abortion personally but supports a woman's right to choose for herself. His stance has drawn criticism over the years. \"Personally, I'm opposed to abortion and I'm opposed to the death penalty,\" he said on NBC's Meet the Press in June. \"The right thing for government is to let women make their own decisions.\" That was a change from Kaine's position in 2005, when he supported parental consent laws and bans on \"partial birth\" abortions, causing the Virginia chapter of NARAL Pro-Choice America to withhold an endorsement in his gubernatorial campaign. As governor, he signed a bill creating \"Choose Life\" license plates in Virginia, which he said was an issue of free speech. Since then, Kaine has actively supported Planned Parenthood and opposed abortion restrictions. In 2013, Kaine cosponsored legislation to improve access to contraception. Affordable Care Act Kaine did not mark himself as a health care reformer when he was Virginia's governor, but his 2006-2010 term overlapped the recession when little change was happening anywhere at state or national levels, Cunningham points out. \"He was probably pretty typical of the middle-of-the-road Democratic governors in sort-of-purple states,\" Cunningham says. \"When the recession hit, that precluded any other major health reform effort that he might have contemplated.\" Kaine supported Obamacare when he ran for Senate in 2012 and has since cosponsored bills to improve the law. Kaine has pushed for Medicaid expansion in Virginia and cosponsored legislation to incentivize expansion in other states as well. Like Clinton, Kaine has proposed adjusting the federal health care law to include some low-income families that aren't currently covered \u2014 fixing the so-called family glitch. This year, he cosponsored a bill to require more businesses to provide benefits under the ACA. Public health Kaine has occasionally incited controversy, as in 2007 when Virginia became the first state to require all girls to get the human papillomavirus vaccine (protection against a virus that can cause cervical cancer) before enrolling in high school. In 2009, he backed a bill that banned smoking in bars and restaurants in the tobacco-producing commonwealth. Opioids Since his election to the Senate four years ago, Kaine has cosponsored bills that would establish an advisory committee to help the FDA approve new opioids, reform guidelines for the VA regarding the prescription of opioids, protect first responders from lawsuits when they administer emergency drugs to counteract an overdose, and create a drug monitoring program for Medicare. Many of those bills were rolled into CARA \u2014 the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act of 2016, which was signed by President Obama in July. The bill bore Kaine's name as a cosponsor.

            "article_content": "Both presumptive presidential nominees gave speeches Friday. Hillary Clinton talked to a Planned Parenthood Action Fund meeting, while Donald Trump addressed a gathering of conservative Christians.  ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Republican and Democratic presidential nominees, were both in Washington today. They were taking jabs at each other and trying to fire up key parts of their party's bases. Trump spoke to religious conservatives. A few miles away, Clinton addressed abortion-rights supporters. NPR's Sarah McCammon reports. SARAH MCCAMMON, BYLINE: Donald Trump likes to tout his support among what he often describes as the evangelicals. That's the crowd he addressed this afternoon. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DONALD TRUMP: We want to uphold the sanctity and dignity of life. (APPLAUSE) MCCAMMON: The event hosted by the Faith and Freedom Coalition and Concerned Women for America was a chance for Trump to firm up support among this key voting block. It was particularly important for Trump who once declared himself very pro-choice. He seemed eager to reassure the crowd that his picks for the Supreme Court would line up with their values. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: And by the way these judges are all pro-life. MCCAMMON: And the thrice-married billionaire praised marriage and family as the building blocks of success. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: The happiest people are the people that have that great religious feel and that incredible marriage, children... MCCAMMON: Some of his most enthusiastic applause, though, came after a series of attacks on his Democratic rival, including her record as the former secretary of state. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: Hillary Clinton - or as I call her crooked Hillary Clinton... (APPLAUSE) MCCAMMON: Trump painted the Clintons as deeply enmeshed in the establishment and beholden to donors and groups who've paid them speaking fees. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: These donors own Hillary Clinton. They own her. And Bernie Sanders was right about that. MCCAMMON: Trump is coming off a week where he has struggled to unite his party. Leading Republicans criticized his comments about a federal judge presiding over the Trump University fraud lawsuit. Trump said the judge was treating him unfairly because of his Mexican heritage. Across town, Clinton picked up on that. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) HILLARY CLINTON: When Donald Trump says a distinguished judge born in Indiana can't do his job because of his Mexican heritage... MCCAMMON: She said Trump's attacks go against everything we stand for. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CLINTON: He does not see all Americans as Americans. MCCAMMON: Clinton was making her case today in front of a loyal audience, members of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund. She argued the stakes in this election are high, especially for women. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CLINTON: And we have to ask ourselves and you have to ask everyone you come in contact with - do we want to put our health, our lives, our futures in Donald Trump's hands? MCCAMMON: That's a question both candidates are likely to keep asking voters in the coming months as each tries to paint their rival as someone not to be trusted.

Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders both pledged their allegiance Thursday to the cause of campaign finance reform during the final Democratic presidential debate before the New Hampshire primary. Polls show that many Americans agree: Too much money comes from too few donors. The candidates' solutions, predictably, were somewhat less certain. SuperPACs Sanders: \"What we should do, and one of the things we should do is not only talk the talk, but walk the walk. I am very proud to be the only candidate up here who does not have a superPAC and special interests.\" Clinton: \"Today, you've got hedge fund billionaires aligned with Karl Rove, running ads against me to try to get Democrats to vote for you. I know this game. I'm going to stop this game.\" SuperPACs came into existence in 2010, after Citizens United and another court ruling. Unlike regular political action committees, they can raise unlimited money from corporations, unions and the wealthy. They're supposed to be independent players, not coordinating with candidates or party committees. But this year, every major presidential candidate except Sanders has at least one \"independent\" superPAC on his or her team. Republican Ted Cruz has five. Sanders may not have a superPAC near at hand, but the union National Nurses United is pretty close. It endorsed him this summer, and its political arm sends nurses to knock on doors and to trail his campaign bus in one of their own. NNU has spent more than $1 million so far. Friends of the Earth's superPAC has run pro-Sanders TV ads in Iowa and New Hampshire, and four other progressive groups have made smaller efforts. Conservative superPACS have already poured more than $5 million into attacks on Clinton, according to the pro-transparency Sunlight Foundation. They include American Crossroads, guided by GOP consultant Karl Rove; Freedom Partners Action Fund, part of the Koch brothers network; and Keep the Promise I, a pro-Cruz superPAC. None of these groups supports Sanders. Clinton gets support from unions and superPACs representing the National Education Association, Human Rights Campaign and Planned Parenthood, among others. But the superPAC aligned with her campaign, Priorities USA Action, is saving its money for the general election. As of Dec. 31, it had $35.8 million on hand and had spent just $5.7 million \u2013 less than $400,000 of it for Clinton. And finally, Sanders is drawing some superPAC attacks too. Ending Spending Action Fund, has spent $774,321 against Sanders, according to Sunlight. Citizens United Clinton: \"I want to reverse Citizens United.\" Sanders: \"No nominee of mine, if I'm elected president, to the United States Supreme Court will get that nomination unless he or she is loud and clear, and says they will vote to overturn Citizens United.\" Attacking this 2010 Supreme Court ruling, which let corporations and unions spend freely to promote or attack candidates, is a sure applause line at Democratic rallies. Actually doing something about it is much harder. To get a Supreme Court that would reverse the decision requires changes on the Court. That could happen over the next four years, when four of the nine justices will be 80 or older. Both Sanders and Clinton promise to put forward nominees who oppose the legal theory underlying Citizens United \u2013 just the kind of litmus test that liberals criticized in less partisan times. To circumvent the courts, some reform advocates call for a constitutional amendment. Both Sanders and Clinton endorse the idea. But it would amount to amending the First Amendment, something other reformers are wary of. It's also hard, requiring approval by two-thirds of each chamber of Congress, or of a constitutional convention, plus ratification by three-quarters of the 50 state legislatures. Congress has even refused to pass legislation to fulfill a section of the Citizens United ruling that calls for immediate disclosure of corporate political spending. These have been largely party-line votes. Public Financing MSNBC moderator Chuck Todd asked Sanders why he isn't seeking public financing, a system that was used by the winners of every Democratic and Republican nominating contest from 1976 to 1996. Sanders: \"It is a public financing system that everybody knows is antiquated. It no longer works. Nobody can become president based on that system.\" He's right. The public financing system badly needs updating. As it is, candidates get too little, too late, compared to what's being spent in modern campaigns. A publicly-financed candidate can spend up to $48.1 million in the primaries. Both Clinton and Sanders have already raised more than twice that much. One 2016 candidate did apply for public financing: Democrat Martin O'Malley. He qualified to get $846,365.09 (money supplied by the $3 public-financing checkoff on income tax forms). The Treasury sent him the first $100,000 on Jan. 4. O'Malley finished a distant third in the Iowa caucuses Feb. 1 and dropped out that night. Clinton and Sanders both say the system needs fixing, and some sort of public financing should be available for House and Senate candidates. With Republicans likely to keep their House majority in November, public financing, like other big changes in the campaign finance system, seems like a long shot.",

And then he'll say that the silent majority feels abused, or forgotten, or mistreated. And usually, toward the end of his speech, Trump says that the silent majority is back. He rarely spends too much time explicitly defining this group, but at a recent Trump rally in Clear Lake, Iowa, several attendees still had working definitions. \"The people that mind their own business, don't depend on anyone else,\" said Patty Hughes of Indianola, Iowa, when asked to describe silent majority. \"[They] don't expect anything from anybody, and they're kind of quiet. They don't go around bragging. They're not activists.\" Her husband, Larry, said, \"They expect a dollar work for a dollar pay. They don't want anything free, but they don't want stuff taken away from them either. And that's happening to us out here in the cheap seats.\" Others said the silent majority is defined by fiscal conservatism, or disapproval of things like Planned Parenthood, or anger with government gridlock. Dan Fix of Mason City, Iowa, said the quintessential member of the silent majority would be Joe the Plumber, or in Iowa's case, he pointed out, Joe the Farmer. Though Trump may have brought the idea of the silent majority to the forefront this election season, it actually has a long history. It's been around for some time, at least since Richard Nixon made the term what it is in the modern era. \"It comes deeply from Richard Nixon's basic political orientation,\" said Rick Perlstein, a historian who has written multiple books on conservatism and the Nixon era, including Nixonland: The Rise of a President and the Fracturing of America and The Invisible Bridge: The Fall of Nixon and the Rise of Reagan. Perlstein points to a speech Nixon gave on Nov. 3, 1969, defending the unpopular Vietnam War, at a time when anti-war fervor was mounting. \"On Oct. 15, 1969, there was a massive anti-war demonstration,\" he said. \"Two million Americans of every walk of life \u2014 from small towns, from big towns, young people, old people \u2014 basically took off work or school in a moratorium against the Vietnam War. And it really looked like the movement against Vietnam, after a grace period or a honeymoon that Richard Nixon enjoyed, it entered the mainstream of American politics, and Richard Nixon and his White House immediately went to work to try and discredit that massive outpouring of mainstream support for the anti-war movement as somehow not quite American.\" In one line of that November speech, Nixon called them out directly, speaking of protesters in San Francisco carrying signs that read \"Lose in Vietnam. Bring the boys home.\" \"As president of the United States,\" Nixon said, \"I would be untrue to my oath of office if I allowed the policy of this nation to be dictated by the minority who holds that point of view and who try to impose it on the nation by mounting demonstrations in the street.\" And later in the speech, it came: \"And so tonight, to you, the great silent majority, my fellow Americans, I ask for your support.\" Perlstein said the speech, and the language of the silent majority, was a distillation of Nixon's political philosophy, \"the idea that there are two kinds of Americans \u2014 the ordinary middle-class folks with the white picket fence who play by the rules and pay their taxes and don't protest and the people who basically come from the left.\" And over time, the term silent majority was used to exclude more than just anti-war protesters. The \"noisy minority,\" as Perlstein called it, was fairly large. \"It was black civil rights militants,\" he said. \"It was feminists who were supposedly burning their bras. It was students who were smoking drugs. It was rock 'n' roll bands. It was everything that threatened that kind of 1950s Leave It to Beaver vision of what America was like before everything literally and figuratively went to pot.\" A recent Hoover Institution study found that just over a third of Donald Trump supporters are over 65 years old, so a good portion of people hearing him speak of the silent majority might remember that time well. Perlstein also pointed out that, in some ways, the phrase was racially coded. \"To say majority is to say minority, and everyone knows who minorities are. They are people in America who are not white,\" he said. Of course, in many ways, 2016 is not the 1960s, and multiple Trump supporters have told NPR that they don't think the term \"silent majority\" has a racial connotation. \"I don't think that's true at all now,\" said George Davey of West Des Moines. \"You can look at Trump, [and the] people he hires. I'm sure he has a lot of people of various ethnic backgrounds in his companies.\" Davey has a photo of Trump that's several feet tall looming over the fence of his backyard, looking onto a busy street. He says he is a big Trump fan, but he didn't want to share whom he plans to caucus for just yet. To Davey, the silent majority today is all about opposition to the rise of what he calls \"PC culture.\" \"The reason why we're silent is because we're not allowed to talk,\" he said. \"My favorite thing about Trump is that he wants to get rid of political correctness. It all started out as anti-bullying, where all of a sudden you can't say certain things because you're bullying them.\" But Davey said it has snowballed, and now, he thinks people can get fired from their jobs, or sued, just for saying the wrong thing. \"That is against the Constitution.\" Whether Davey's opposition to political correctness perfectly matches Nixon's modern definition of the silent majority or not, historian Perlstein says it really doesn't matter. \"The silent majority is always going to be a state of mind,\" he said. \"It's a feeling. It's a feeling of dispossession. And that feeling of dispossession can come about most dramatically in times when things seem to be changing, when all that's solid melts into air.\"",

CHANG: The point of all of this is symbolism, pure and simple. Republicans want a direct confrontation with the president, and putting a bill repealing the health care law on his desk, forcing him to veto it and therefore making him defend the Affordable Care Act and Planned Parenthood, for that matter - that is the end game. What Republicans are trying to do is highlight the contrast between their party and Democrats and to make it clear to voters this year how life might be different under a Republican president with a Republican-led Congress. This is totally about messaging. CORNISH: Right. But this is not an entirely new message, right? I mean, Republicans have voted dozens of times to repeal the health care law. CHANG: Yes, but they've never been able to show their constituents that they can get the bill to the president's desk until now. You're right. In the House, Republicans have voted more than 50 times the last five years to repeal all or parts of the Affordable Care Act, but it's never been so easy in the Senate because in the Senate, you need 60 votes to pass most legislation. And Republicans have never had that, neither before nor after they took control of the chamber. But in 2015, what Senate Republicans did have at their disposal was a special legislative process called reconciliation. It's a procedural tool that allows certain kinds of legislation to get through the Senate with only 51 votes instead of the usual 60. This is actually one of the tools Democrats used to pass the health care law in the first place. Ad now Senate Republicans are using it to repeal the law. CORNISH: Meanwhile, you know, if President Obama plans to veto this bill, voters aren't actually going to get to see, like, an alternative health care regime - right? - like, something that Republicans have come up with and put into action. CHANG: That's right. Neither the House nor the Senate has ever debated any bill to replace the Affordable Care Act. So what would that replacement look like? You know, Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell famously said that he wants to repeal Obamacare root and branch. But he's from a state - Kentucky - that's shown significant improvement to health care access because of Medicaid expansion under this law. In fact, a number of Republican lawmakers are from states that have chosen to expand Medicaid, so the question is, could voters actually stomach it if Republicans really wiped away Obamacare? CORNISH: All right, Ailsa, so what kind of Republican health care proposals are we likely to see out of Congress this election year? CHANG: Well, that's the question that still needs to be answered. House speaker Paul Ryan gave a speech last month at the Library of Congress. And in that speech, he promised to unveil a plan that would replace every word of Obamacare. It would be a plan that's more driven by free market principles, but so far, no plan has been set forth. Ryan says Republicans can't just be the party of opposition. They can't just let the presidential candidates dictate the Republican agenda. But so far, he's been skimpy on details about what that new agenda would look like. And maybe next week we'll have some better idea. Republican lawmakers will be meeting in Baltimore for their annual retreat, and perhaps some concrete ideas will be hashed out then. CORNISH: That's NPR's congressional correspondent Ailsa Chang. Ailsa, thanks so much. CHANG: You're welcome. Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "With a vacancy, Supreme Court justices are looking for ways to avoid tie votes on key issues. On Monday, the justices sent an Obamacare case back to a lower court \u2014 saying compromise seemed feasible.  RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: The U.S. Supreme Court has decided not to decide a major case, a case challenging a federal law mandating birth control coverage in employee health plans. That decision is the latest example of a closely divided eight-justice court struggling to deal with a vacant ninth seat. NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg reports. NINA TOTENBERG, BYLINE: The Obama health care overhaul includes a provision that requires all employee insurance plans to include coverage for cost-free birth control. Religious nonprofits like universities, hospitals and charities are permitted to opt out by notifying either the government or their insurer of their religious objection. The insurer or the third-party manager then arranges separate birth control coverage. That accommodation was not enough for some religious nonprofits. They challenged it in court, contending that by being required to notify the government or the insurer that they were opting out that they were triggering separate birth control coverage. Eight out of 9 appeals courts rejected that argument, and the nonprofits appealed to the Supreme Court, which was expected to resolve the issue this term. That, however, was before Justice Antonin Scalia died, leaving a vacant ninth seat and little to no prospect that the Republican-dominated Senate would vote anytime soon on the president's nomination of Merrick Garland to fill the vacancy. At the oral argument in March shortly after Scalia's death, the justices looked as though they might deadlock 4 to 4. In less than a week, though, they took the rare step of floating a compromise solution. And yesterday, the court, in an unsigned unanimous opinion, booted the case back down to the lower courts with instructions to take sufficient time for the two sides to resolve their differences. The reality of the vacant seat has begun to set in. Since Scalia's death in February, there have been three deadlocked votes in cases that had been argued, plus another tie vote last week to stay an execution. Apparently anxious to avoid more ties, the court seems willing to be creative, as it was yesterday. Indeed it went out of its way yesterday to say that it was deciding nothing. Since February, the court has also ruled in the narrowest way possible in some cases, avoiding resolution of any larger question. And it's accepted fewer cases than usual for review next term, focusing its attention on some numbingly-dull questions. After all, unless Merrick Garland were to be confirmed in the lame-duck session of Congress after the election, it's unlikely that any new president's nominee would be sworn in until the spring of 2017, too late to participate in most of the work of the court next term.

            "article_content": "This was a tumultuous year for the U.S. Supreme Court because of the unexpected death of justice Antonin Scalia. In 2017, a new president will likely mean the court will finally get a new justice.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: As 2016 draws to a close, the third branch of government - the judiciary - is very much in flux. There are about a hundred judicial vacancies in the federal court system that President-elect Donald Trump will be able to fill. The most notable is on the Supreme Court. It had a roller coaster of a year, as NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg reports. NINA TOTENBERG, BYLINE: On January 20, 2016, exactly a year to the day before a new president would be sworn into office, Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia announced the court's 8 to 1 decision reinstating the death penalty for two Kansas brothers. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ANTONIN SCALIA: Overwhelming the joint sentencing proceeding was evidence of how these defendants tortured their victims, acts of inconceivable cruelty and depravity, described first hand for the jury by the lone survivor. TOTENBERG: It was the last time the 79-year-old Scalia would announce an opinion he'd authored for the court. Weeks later on a hunting trip to Texas, the conservative icon died in his sleep. Republicans were shocked and horrified, not only was Scalia a revered figure in the conservative community, but he was the fifth conservative vote on a court that was often split along liberal-conservative lines. What's more, though it was an election year, there was plenty of time to confirm a replacement and no precedent for stalling nearly a year to stave off that possibility. Nonetheless, within hours of Scalia's death, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell vowed to block consideration of anyone President Obama would nominate to the court. The choice, McConnell said, should be made by the next president after the election. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MITCH MCCONNELL: Give the people a voice in filling this vacancy. TOTENBERG: Obama tried to finesse an appointment, picking as his nominee a man Republicans had urged him to appoint for years, Merrick Garland, the center-left chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia and a man revered by his colleagues on both the right and left. Obama kept pointing out that he had fulfilled his constitutional duty. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Now it's time for the Senate to do their job. Give Judge Garland a hearing. Give Judge Garland an up or down vote. TOTENBERG: Still, McConnell didn't budge. His position was so unprecedented that many Republicans, in addition to Democrats, thought the GOP would pay a price at the polls for such obstructionism. The ploy, however, turned out to be ingenious and twisting arms and making quiet threats, McConnell managed to keep his own Senate troops in line. Meanwhile, Donald Trump was catering to the socially conservative base of the Republican Party by promising to name a Scalia-like conservative to the court. And while Hillary Clinton rarely mentioned the court on the campaign trail, Trump drove the issue home relentlessly day after day. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DONALD TRUMP: You have no choice. You got to go for Trump - Supreme Court justices. Look, Supreme Court Justice Scalia - great, was supposed to live for a long time. He died. TOTENBERG: And to further allay fears among social conservatives, Trump released a list of 21 potential Supreme Court nominees largely compiled by the conservative Heritage Foundation. Moreover, in the aftermath of the election, he said what he had not before, that he would fill the Scalia vacancy with someone from that list. The odds-on favorite among those on the list is Federal Appeals Court Judge William Pryor of Alabama, mainly because the attorney general designate Jeff Sessions is also from Alabama and has considerable influence with President-elect Trump. Judge Pryor is an outspoken critic of the Supreme Court's decisions on abortion, homosexuality and the so-called Miranda warning. But when he was Alabama's attorney general, he won points among many for his role in removing the state's chief justice for refusing to carry out a federal court order to remove a Ten Commandments monument from the courthouse. Also believed to be at the top of the short list is Judge Diane Sykes, a federal appeals court judge from Wisconsin with a bedrock conservative record. She authored an opinion expanding the rights of employers to limit their workers access to contraceptives on religious grounds. She wrote an opinion striking down Chicago's law banning firing ranges within city limits. And she wrote an opinion mandating state subsidies for anti-gay religious groups on college campuses, a position subsequently reversed by the Supreme Court. Also believed to be on the Trump shortlist are other serious conservative judges from the federal appeals courts. Among them Raymond Kethledge of Michigan, who ordered the IRS to turn over a list of conservative groups it had targeted for examination. Judge Thomas Hardiman of Pennsylvania, who dissented when his court upheld a New Jersey law that required citizens to show a demonstrated need for carrying a gun in public. Judge Raymond Gruender of Missouri, who wrote a decision upholding state-mandated suicide warnings before abortions. And Judge Stephen Colleton, who is known for decisions reversing major verdicts that favored whistleblowers and consumers. Judge Colloton is from Iowa, the home state of the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee Charles Grassley. Many of these potential nominees are said to have a sympathetic personal story. Judge Sykes, for instance, raised two children as a single mother after her divorce. Judge Gruender, the son of a janitor, had a childhood touched by family violence. In 1986 when he was a law student, His father pointed a gun at him, his sister and a younger brother. Gruender and his sister were shot, but Gruender was able to knock his father to the floor, saving his 12-year-old brother. There are other names on the Trump list. And as we have seen with other high-profile slots, Trump is more than willing to change his mind. But with Trump and his team now pushing to name and confirm his Cabinet, naming a Supreme Court nominee is not immediately on the front burner. It will be after the new president is sworn in. An announcement is expected in January or early February, in all likelihood, with confirmation hearings sometime in March. And unless there are unforeseen difficulties, a vote by the full Senate sometime in April. Even if the Senate is able to meet that schedule, however, the Supreme Court term will be almost over, with just six days of oral arguments left on the schedule in late April.

With just one week left before the deadline, there's still no deal in sight.  RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: Congress had just one thing to do this month - keep the government funded past September 30 because lawmakers take a recess in October. In theory, a straightforward task, but nothing is simple in Congress. And as NPR's Ailsa Chang reports, there still is no deal in sight. AILSA CHANG, BYLINE: There was this fantasy circulating the Senate last week that they would be able to wrap up business and head home three weeks early to get back to campaigning. It was such a widely adopted fantasy many senators, like Republican John Thune of South Dakota, had a ready explanation for why it wouldn't be worth sticking around for the rest of September after they got the spending bill done. JOHN THUNE: I mean, I think doing anything else requires a high level of cooperation, which probably between now and November 8 isn't going to exist around here. CHANG: Turns out, there wasn't even enough cooperation to get out of town early. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) HARRY REID: We're in no hurry to go anyplace place, OK? We're - have a lot of time. CHANG: Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid and Democrats in both chambers say the latest offer by Republicans is a no-go. So far, the only things both sides can agree on are keeping the government open through December 9 and providing emergency aid to fight Zika without restricting funds for Planned Parenthood. It was progress, but the latest Republican proposal also contains flood aid for Louisiana and other states without providing any aid for the water contamination crisis in Flint, Mich. Democrat Chuck Schumer of New York says that is unacceptable. CHUCK SCHUMER: The question is they want to put Louisiana in, and we said you can't put Louisiana in unless you put Flint in. CHANG: But treating these disasters as inseparable offends Republicans like Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, who says the people in Flint can be taken care of after the election. Flood victims in Louisiana cannot wait that long. BILL CASSIDY: We shouldn't hold folks, who right now still have mud in their house and are thinking of throwing the keys to their house on the table of their banker because they cannot afford their mortgage, hostage to other people's grief. CHANG: There's also a squabble over a provision that would prevent the Securities and Exchange Commission from forcing companies to disclose political spending. It's current law, but Democrats want it out. By the end of the week, negotiations in the Senate were deadlocked. Meanwhile, over in the House, Speaker Paul Ryan tried to sound reassuring. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PAUL RYAN: We're going to have a no-drama moment here, a low - I should say there's never no drama around here. We're going to have low drama. CHANG: Or so he hopes. Ryan will need House Democrats to get this bill through because many conservative Republicans have already said they're voting no. Ailsa Chang, NPR News, the Capitol. Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.

            "article_content": "Donations appear to be up substantially in 2016, partly due to the improving economy. But also some donors expect tax rates, and therefore the value of charitable deductions, to go down under Trump.  ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: By all accounts, 2016 will turn out to be a successful year for charities. Many nonprofits say they've seen a big increase in donations, and that doesn't count the last few days of December when there's often a rush of last-minute giving. One reason could be the strong stock market. But as NPR's Pam Fessler reports, that's not the only thing behind the rise. PAM FESSLER, BYLINE: There are many signs that this will be a good year for philanthropy. One of the biggest came last month on what's called Giving Tuesday. That's a day-long campaign to encourage online giving. This year, it netted $168 million, a whopping 44 percent more than the year before. And charitable groups say they've seen other encouraging signs. LORIE SLUTSKY: Contributions are frantically coming in. FESSLER: Lorie Slutsky is president of the New York Community Trust, which supports many of the city's nonprofits. She says fundraising is up about $35 million over last year. She credits the strong economy but says some donors have also told her that their accountants are recommending that they give more this year because of possible tax changes next year under President Trump. SLUTSKY: We've had a donor who's been with us for a long time who was going to give this year anyway but quadrupled his contribution because he thought rates are likely to go down. FESSLER: And lower tax rates mean charitable deductions aren't worth as much. But that's not all that seems to be driving donors. Perla Ni is CEO of Great Nonprofits, a site that posts reviews of charities to help people decide where to send their money. She thinks many donors are reacting to the November election and fears that programs they support could come under fire. PERLA NI: Some of the organizations that we've seen an increase in giving to are homeless organizations, organizations that serve women, organizations that help Muslims integrate into American society. So these are all the types of causes that people feel strongly about. FESSLER: And she says they want to ensure that they'll be well-funded in the coming year. Stacy Palmer, who edits the Chronicle of Philanthropy, says progressive groups have benefited the most. STACY PALMER: There's an expectation that they're going to have to do more. So groups like Planned Parenthood, as well, are seeing increased donations. And those have continued throughout the whole year-end period. FESSLER: Palmer thinks that, overall, charitable donations will be up 4 or 5 percent this year. But she says there's a flip side. Many nonprofits rely on federal funding to provide services like housing and health care, and they worry what will happen to those funds if Republicans cut spending as they've promised to do. PALMER: Plus, nonprofits serve the people who receive government aid. So if there's cuts in welfare that affect the very poor, they'll turn to charities for help. So the budgets of nonprofits themselves may be cut, and the people they serve may get cut. FESSLER: And she says even a generous boost in giving probably won't fill the gap, which is why Lieutenant Colonel Ron Busroe, who oversees fundraising and community relations for the Salvation Army, says his group hopes to meet soon with the incoming president and his staff. RON BUSROE: To be able to express to him the fact that there are those in our society who do need help, and they certainly cannot be forgotten. FESSLER: Still, Busroe is pleased that online donations this year are up 12 percent, and the Salvation Army's Red Kettle campaign this holiday season is on track to break last year's record.

            "article_content": "The House and Senate are set to adjourn Thursday for a seven week summer recess that leaves behind in Washington, D.C., much unfinished business and sets up what could be a contentious fall.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: Congress adjourns today for a seven-week summer break. Lawmakers passed a few bills, including a compromise between food producers and consumer advocates on genetically modified ingredients. We'll hear more about that in a moment. First NPR congressional reporter Susan Davis joins us with a rundown of what Congress did and did not accomplish. Hi, Sue. SUSAN DAVIS, BYLINE: Hey, Ari. SHAPIRO: Let's start on a positive note. There was this bill on GMOs. What other bills did Congress actually pass? DAVIS: OK, so Congress today sent to President Obama legislation that aims to combat the heroin and opioid epidemic. The legislation creates more training and education and health resources for first responders and treatment specialists. This is a significant shift in the attitudes of policymakers and how they look at drug addiction in this country. Congress has essentially moved away from looking at drug epidemics as a criminal justice problem and to a public health problem. It's a fundamentally more empathetic view of the problem. It passed with huge bipartisan support in both chambers, but of course there are still complains about it. Democrats say it doesn't include the money it needs to make these new policies work. Republicans say they'll provide additional funding in future separate spending bills. SHAPIRO: So that's the very short list of things that did get done - much longer list of things that did not get done, right? DAVIS: Yeah. The most-talked-about measure as they leave town is a $1.1 billion spending bill to combat the Zika virus which causes birth defects in pregnant women. Republicans reached a deal on the bill, but it passed through the House on a party line vote. It's now stalled in the Senate where Democrats say they won't vote for it because Republicans included a provision that they say will block Planned Parenthood, particularly in Puerto Rico, from getting any of those funds. Republicans say Democrats are just holding this up because they want to have this is an election-year issue, and it has now become an election-year issue. President Obama, if you remember, asked for this money back in February, and now it doesn't have a chance for passage until at least September. SHAPIRO: We have heard so much talk from Congress in the last couple months, including all-night talkathons about gun legislation. Was it all talk, no action? DAVIS: The problem, Ari, is they can't agree on what the problem is. Democrats see this strictly as an argument about the access and availability of guns, and they want tougher gun laws. Republicans fundamentally disagree with this, and they are the ones in control of Congress. Republicans instead are responding with proposals to fight terrorism and radicalization. You know, neither party has ruled out maybe some action this fall, but considering how little common ground there is, there probably needs to be another election to see which way the needle is going to move in Congress on this. SHAPIRO: Well, Congress comes back in September with still, you know, a couple months until the election. Any chance of stuff getting done then? DAVIS: You know, no one I talked to is planning for a busy fall. The most important thing they have to do and really the only thing they have to do is keep the government running. When they come back in September, they'll have about four weeks to cut a deal to make sure the government doesn't shut down, and they have two options - a quick fix or a longer-term spending deal. You know, the lawmakers I've talked to this week say a short-term punt in September is the most likely, and all these tough choices on spending will be left until after the election. SHAPIRO: NPR's Susan Davis, thank you. DAVIS: Thanks, Ari. Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

The march aims to \"send a bold message to our new administration on their first day in office, and to the world that women's rights are human rights,\" according to the event's official website. \"We want to ensure that this country knows women are not happy,\" co-founder Tamika Mallory said. \"And when we get angry, change happens. We make things happen.\" Catalyzed by a polarizing presidential race, the march aims to be a message to the new administration that there's a coalition planning to press the issue of women's rights in potentially high-profile ways over the next four years. \"This effort is not anti-Trump,\" Mallory said. \"This is pro-women. This is a continuation of a struggle women have been dealing with for a very long time. In this moment, we are connecting and being as loud as possible.\" Trump created firestorms when it came to women's issues during the campaign. Upset with Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly bringing up in a debate his past crude remarks about women (calling some \"pigs,\" for example), he responded that she had \"blood coming out of her \u2014 wherever.\" Trump was also caught on tape bragging about grabbing women by the genitals. \"[W]hen you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything,\" Trump said in the leaked 2005 video. Trump has a long history of making sexist or offensive remarks, and his candidacy happened to take place while running against a candidate who would have been the first female president. What started as a cross-country collaboration among seven women in the aftermath of Election Day gained traction online and is now a network of 50-plus events in multiple countries. Historical significance is embedded in the event's name: To march in Washington evokes the legacies of powerful public demonstrations in American history, such as Martin Luther King Jr.'s March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, the Moratorium March to End the War in Vietnam, the Million Man March to highlight the collective power of the African-American community, and the 2004 March for Women's Lives as a demonstration for reproductive and women's rights. Organizers are hoping to create a social movement, but Marcia Chatelain, a faculty fellow at Georgetown University's Center for Social Justice, said doing that depends on whether the Women's March's momentum can be sustained long after the march itself. \"One of the goals of any type of march or any type of visible sign of solidarity is to get inspired, to inspire people to do more,\" Chatelain said. \"And the question is, at the march, what kind of organizational structures or movements will also be present to help people know how to channel their energy for the next day and for the long haul?\" Organizers and activists can use the march to proffer alternative ways to create change in their communities and contribute to a greater movement from a local, everyday standpoint. \"Movements are not just the dramatic moments,\" Chatelain said. \"It's about the everyday acts of resistance that the marches are also trying to represent. Everyone has the capacity in their communities to resist.\" A single event, while important to rally on a grass-roots level, is often politically ineffective in its immediate aftermath \u2014 it can take years to figure out how a demonstration like the Women's March will inform public policy, if at all. Georgetown history professor Michael Kazin noted that when it comes to effectively altering legislation, public demonstrations alone have a \"checkered history of success.\" To affect policy, Kazin said, a march needs to be part of a greater social movement with clear and consistent objectives, constant pressure on the Legislature, dedicated support from its base and continued momentum. Perhaps most importantly, creating systemic change has historically called for one last critical element: help from people in government. \"All successful movements in American history have both inside and outside strategy,\" Kazin said. \"If you're just protesting, and it just stops there, you're not going to get anything done.\"",

Barbara Mikulski (D-MD) hold a campaign rally at City Garage April 10, 2016 in Baltimore, Maryland.\n                \n                    \n                    Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Hillary Clinton and Sen. Barbara Mikulski (D-MD) hold a campaign rally at City Garage April 10, 2016 in Baltimore, Maryland. A listener named Josh recently sent us a clip of him talking politics with his daughter, Penelope. The bit that caught our attention (and that we highlighted in our last weekly roundup podcast) was where Penelope finds out that a \"girl\" is running for president, then insists that her father vote for her. He presses Penelope on this: \"What if I said I'm voting for Ted Cruz just because he's a man?\" he asks. \"If he was the first man to be president,\" she says. The idea of a girl running for president takes Penelope's breath away, and okay, it's really sweet (for example: \"Would you vote for me?\" she asks her dad), but what Penelope doesn't know is that she is taking a stand on one of the touchier debates of the 2016 election: is it OK to vote for a candidate just because she's a woman? Or, to broaden it out, is it OK to vote for any candidate because of his or her identity? To Penelope, the answer is (an exasperated) yes. But the answer to this question is less clear to many on the 2016 campaign trail. \"A uterus doesn't qualify you to be president.\" On the one hand, there is the view that issues, not demographics, should determine a person's vote. Bernie Sanders gave voice to this after rapper Killer Mike was lambasted for saying (quoting a Bernie supporter) that \"a uterus doesn't qualify you to be president.\" \"What Mike said, essentially, is that ... people should not be voting for candidates based on their gender, but on what they believe. I think that makes sense,\" Sanders responded. \"I don't go around \u2014 no one has ever heard me say, 'Hey guys, stand together, vote for a man.' \" Carly Fiorina delivered a similar message when she dropped out of the Republican race, telling women not to let their gender dictate their votes. \"To young girls and women across the country, I say: do not let others define you,\" she said. \"Do not listen to anyone who says you have to vote a certain way or for a certain candidate because you're a woman. That is not feminism.\" Sanders supporter and actress Susan Sarandon put it more bluntly at a campaign stop in February: \"I don't vote with my vagina.\" There's a basic logic at work there: the idea is that beliefs, not gender expression, dictate which issues a president champions, what foreign policy they decide to pursue, and what bills they sign. But the identity-issue divide isn't clear-cut to all voters. For one, gender simply is itself an issue for some voters. Author Rebecca Traister told NPR she was frustrated in 2008 \u2014 as she is now \u2014 when she says she saw lots of people shaming women for wanting to support the woman candidate in the race: \"It's certainly not the foremost reason that anybody I knew supported [Hillary Clinton in the 2008 presidential primaries], but of course it played into lots of people's excitement about her, right? But you couldn't say it. It was considered a dumb thing to say. It was considered a super feminized thing to say. You were thinking with your ovaries. It's just because you were a girl, blah blah blah. \"And I remember thinking, Since when is it progressively OK that a country that's 51 percent female has only been governed by men? And that more than 80 percent of Congress is male? Why is it OK to not care about that? Gender may not be the only reason many women are voting for Hillary Clinton, but it plays into many people's votes, Traister said. And given that politics has been so heavily dominated by men (and, specifically, white men), another feminist told NPR earlier this year that it too often unfairly puts other groups' issues in the \"specialty issue\" category. \"Inherently we believe that white people's issues are the mainstream issues or men's issues are the mainstream issues,\" said Renee Bracey Sherman, a feminist and reproductive rights activist (who says she has donated to both Sanders and Clinton). \"Everything else is a 'sideline issue.'\" To be clear, Sanders and Clinton both are heavily promoting gender equality on the campaign trail, and they both have strong feminist support. Still, Bracey Sherman and Traister might well agree with Penelope that being the first (or among the first) of your group to reach the White House matters. Different demographic groups, different priorities The question at issue here may well be whether \"the issues\" and identity can really be separated from each other. For some, like Traister, seeing yourself represented in office can itself be an issue. And in Bracey Sherman's mind, some women's and minority groups' issues haven't gotten as much attention as they might with a more diverse government. Indeed, there's new evidence that women lawmakers simply advance different agendas than men lawmakers. Writing in the L.A. Times, author Nancy Cohen recently pointed to a variety of research showing that women lawmakers in both U.S. parties \u2014 not to mention in other countries \u2014 tend to pursue different types of laws than men do, advancing domestic violence and childcare-related legislation more often. \"Such findings don't mean that all female officeholders seek to advance women's rights, or that women govern only from the standpoint of gender,\" she added. \"But the research does speak strongly to the fact that women and men in power have different priorities.\" This conversation, of course, isn't limited to gender. This year's field could still yield the first Hispanic-American (Ted Cruz) or Jewish president (Bernie Sanders). The future could still bring America's first minority woman president, as well as the first gay, transgender, Asian American or whatever in the White House \u2014 not to mention still more diversity into Congress. If elected, any of them might well broaden the spectrum of topics that the government considers.",

Stephanie Hundley is an enthusiastic Bernie Sanders supporter. The 28-year-old from Waterloo is also enthusiastic about the fact that she's not going to vote for Hillary Clinton just because she's a woman. \"I don't think she's the woman to be representative of women,\" Hundley said. She ticked off a list of Clinton criticisms: the \"damn emails,\" the \"flip-flops,\" her vote to go to war in Iraq. Citing Sanders' record of supporting women's rights, Hundley said his overall views embody hers more than Clinton's do. \"It's weird that an old, white guy would represent women better than an actual woman.\" Many millennial women, like Hundley, want to deal a repeat upset to Clinton in the Hawkeye State. Eight years ago, Clinton lost the women's vote in Iowa to another candidate promising change in Washington. Entrance polls showed that the only group who favored her were the oldest women \u2014 those over 65. A similar pattern could emerge again this year. Iowa women do prefer Clinton, according to the final Des Moines Register poll before the Iowa caucuses, but that support is strongest among women over 45. The split has exposed a fault line around feminism in America, between women who grew up in an era when they weren't allowed to wear pants to work, for example \u2014 and young women who have never known the kind of discrimination and stereotypes their mothers faced. A recent poll even found that young women supported Sanders in greater numbers than young men. A January online survey of young voters from USA Today and Rock the Vote showed that women under 35 supported Sanders by an almost 20-point margin, compared to men's 4-point margin. Dueling Identities: 'Young' Vs. 'Woman' Bernie Sanders greets the audience at a fundraising event and rally.\n                \n                    \n                    Rick Loomis/LA Times via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Bernie Sanders greets the audience at a fundraising event and rally. Katherine Hillicker is a freshman at Michigan State who came down to Iowa to canvass for Sanders. She sees near-universal support for Sanders among their peers at Michigan State, and she thinks she knows why. Young people, she said, \"have grown up in this situation where the economy has been crap, and we're going to college, and it's costing a ton of money.\" She and her friend, fellow Michigan State student Mackenzie Pollick, say they think Sanders appeals more to young people on those economic issues. As for gender? It was an afterthought for them. \"I think you need to care more about the issues than the gender,\" Hillicker said. Pollick added, \"As much as I'd love a woman to be president, it doesn't affect my views much.\" The age gap is stark. A recent Quinnipiac poll found that Sanders bests Clinton among 18- to 44-year-olds, 78 percent to 21 percent. But support for Clinton seems to grow with age: 53 percent of 45- to 64-year-olds chose her, along with 71 percent of people 65 and older. Both Clinton and Sanders have made a point of appealing to both women, on issues of reproductive rights and equal pay, as well as young voters, on student debt. However, the Sanders campaign's promises of sweeping change seems to have helped him win over Iowa's youngest voters, and he's doing everything he can to capitalize on that popularity. In addition to hitting young people's economic worries hard in his speeches, the Sanders campaign has also been working to mobilize the youngest Iowa voters on caucus night. In its \"Go Home for Bernie\" push, the campaign is driving young people away from college towns, like Ames and Iowa City, to their smaller Iowa hometowns, to better spread his support all over the state. That's important in a caucus state that won't report raw vote, but shares of delegates. 'There's Going Go Be A Lot More Elections In Our Lifetime' Some young voters say it would be nice to have the first female president \u2014 but that's about as excited as they get. \"We're still young,\" said Olivia Vogel, an Iowa State student, \"and there's going to be a lot more elections in our lifetime, that right now I wouldn't choose just because she's a woman.\" A woman wears a campaign button in the vein of Rosie the Riveter to a Hillary Clinton event in Davenport, Iowa.\n                \n                    \n                    Andrew Harnik/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption A woman wears a campaign button in the vein of Rosie the Riveter to a Hillary Clinton event in Davenport, Iowa. Vogel attended a Clinton rally in Ames on Saturday, but isn't supporting a candidate yet. \"I feel like I grew up in a pretty equitable society where I think men and women are based fairly,\" said Vogel's friend Julia Zappa, a sophomore at the University of St. Thomas in St. Paul. Though she was at the Clinton event, she said she supports Republican Chris Christie. \"I think for a younger generation, we don't need to rush for a woman to become president, because I feel like it'll happen, so I don't want to rush.\" The long string of presidential elections ahead of them is full of the possibility \u2014 or even the probability, as Zappa sees it \u2014 of a female president. That means other issues feel much more pressing right now. \"I don't think voting for a woman is particularly novel for them,\" said Dianne Bystrom, director of the Carrie Chapman Catt Center for Women and Politics at Iowa State University. \"The fact that the nation elected its first African-American candidate in 2008, it's kind of taken the edge out of those narrow parameters of who can be president.\" If that's true, the gender card \u2014 which Clinton is playing more forcefully this year than in 2008 \u2014 may be less effective now for some young voters. But their minds may change as they age. \"I think younger women will face some discrimination in their lives, but when they're young, they probably haven't,\" Bystrom said. Older women, meanwhile, \"feel that it's about time to have a woman president,\" she added. Of course, the reasons anyone supports Clinton (or Sanders) are far more nuanced than voting for a gender. Many women \u2014 old or young, supporting Clinton or Sanders \u2014 say that gender isn't a factor at all in choosing a candidate. And some Sanders-supporting women say they considered the draw of caucusing for a woman, but it ultimately couldn't sway them. Likewise, for many Clinton supporters, who are drawn in by her gender, it's simply one of many reasons. However, it is a reason that amps up their enthusiasm. \"It's about time we caught up with the rest of the civilized world,\" said Maureen Ekeland of West Des Moines, who attended a Clinton speech in Ames with her daughter and granddaughter. All three are Clinton supporters. \"It's don't think it's the only thing, and it might not be the main thing. But absolutely \u2014 it would be an amazing thing,\" said Jennifer Ruggle of Waukee, Ekeland's daughter.

At the other end of the spectrum from the college students attending the event, who feel they have a lifetime to put a woman in the White House, there are the women who say time is running out. One Clinton volunteer said those women motivate her. \"There are so many children that need to grow up in a situation where it's normal to have a female president,\" said Kim Frederick of Houston. Frederick told NPR's Tamara Keith the story of an elderly woman she met at a Clinton rally in 2008, when Frederick was also a volunteer. \"And she said, 'Please, I'm 94 years old,' \" Frederick said. \"I can't get out there and volunteer. Can you please make this happen? And I promised her I would. And it didn't happen in 2008, and she's probably not around anymore, but there's another 94-year-old woman in a wheelchair that I have to do that for this time. And we're going to make it happen.\" Gender Matters In The General Importantly, it's not that supporting Sanders means rejecting Clinton. Many female Sanders supporters who spoke to NPR said they'd support Clinton as a general-election candidate (and many of her supporters say the same of Sanders). A woman touches the cheek of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton at a rally in Des Moines, Iowa.\n                \n                    \n                    Andrew Harnik/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption A woman touches the cheek of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton at a rally in Des Moines, Iowa. And general elections make it clear that it doesn't make sense to talk about the \"woman voter,\" as the Atlantic reported in 2012. While it's true that women tended to support Obama in the past two presidential elections, there are factors beyond gender at work here. Single and minority women have tended to support Obama, for example, while white and married women went for Mitt Romney. Once the Democratic candidate is chosen, that's when the battle for women's votes will get even more important, Bystrom pointed out. \"I think gender always factors into elections and typically for the Democrats,\" she said. \"For a Democrat to be president, there has to be a large number of women\" who turn out.",

            "article_content": "An essay posted earlier this month about the concept gas-lighting and how it applied to the 2016 elections highlighted a surprising seriousness of purpose from a magazine traditionally devoted to fashion and pop culture. NPR profiles the two 20-something editors of Teen Vogue.  ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: An online essay went viral this month, the headline - \"Donald Trump Is Gaslighting America.\" And it came from a source that surprised a lot of people, including NPR's media correspondent David Folkenflik. Here's David's report on the changes happening at Teen Vogue. DAVID FOLKENFLIK, BYLINE: The author of the piece, Lauren Duca, argues that Trump relies on deception to undermine the truth so that his critics will question their own judgment and their ability to question him. It's a trick called gaslighting. Here's Duca talking to CNN's Don Lemon. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LAUREN DUCA: We're sort of getting lost in semantics and we're getting lost in these disputes about what is true, which is absurd because we should all be able to agree about what's true and... FOLKENFLIK: Duca's post has been seen 1.2 million times and inspired coverage from Italy to Malaysia. Confession time - it's not the kind of discussion I expected from Teen Vogue. I said so on Twitter with a link to the story. People responded two different ways. I was re-tweeted thousands of times and I also got a lot of flak from readers and fans who said, what took you so long to notice? PHILLIP PICARDI: You know, I love saying to people who are surprised by our content, speak to a teenager in your life and you won't be surprised anymore because that really is the foundation of how we approach Teen Vogue now. FOLKENFLIK: This is Phillip Picardi, Teen Vogue's digital editorial director who greenlit Duca's essay. Teen Vogue is, of course, the offshoot of the famed fashion magazine Vogue created in 2003 by its corporate parent Conde Nast. And yet, I wasn't crazy, Teen Vogue had made a big shift. Elaine Welteroth was promoted in May to become the magazine's new editor. ELAINE WELTEROTH: I think Teen Vogue did an incredible job in that beauty and fashion space for young women. But I think about a year and a half ago I'd say, we all kind of came around the table and said, we have to mean more to our girls. Why are we here today? FOLKENFLIK: The need to compete digitally led them to add politics to the mix. Here's how that happened. Picardi had once been an intern at the magazine. He most recently worked at the digital news site Refinery29. In early 2015, Picardi applied for his current job. PICARDI: In one of my interviews, one of the questions was, how do you grow Teen Vogue from 2 million to 10 million a month? And that was largely the answer. FOLKENFLIK: Together, Picardi and Welteroth say they found Teen Vogue's readers hungry to engage. I interviewed the two editors in tandem at their offices, which had a view of the Statue of Liberty. They tell me they draw upon their own identities to help shape coverage. Welteroth just turned 30, Picardi's only 25. She's an African-American. He's gay. PICARDI: There's always something to cover and there's always something to bring the public consciousness to. And that if that matters to reproductive rights, to transgender rights, to LGBTQ equality as a whole, to police brutality and our ongoing struggle with gun violence, you know, we are going to be tireless in how we cover that stuff. FOLKENFLIK: They're not abandoning their franchise, yet Duca's piece on gaslighting has dislodged Teen Vogue's previously most popular post, titled \"How To Apply Glitter Nail Polish The Right Way.\" And celebrities including the comedian Sarah Silverman and former CBS News anchor Dan Rather retweeted the essay. Elaine Welteroth defines the audience. WELTEROTH: I think of our readers as young, conscious people. We can't underestimate how far-reaching our content is, especially these days. Phil likes to say that our reader is woke and (laughter) I'd have to agree. PICARDI: It's a vocab (ph) word. WELTEROTH: It's a new vocab word that you can use with your teens and I'd agree with him. FOLKENFLIK: Still, it's been a tough time for magazines. Teen Vogue was slashed last month to four print issues a year. I asked whether Conde Nast was committed to print. Welteroth sidestepped the question, saying the brand had never been stronger. Yet digitally, their new formula has gotten them pretty close to that goal of 10 million distinct readers each month.

            "article_content": "Thousands of people are expected in Washington, D.C., next month to protest the inauguration of Donald Trump. They'll join thousands more who will be there to celebrate the incoming president. But sorting out which group gets to be where is causing controversy. Yasmina Mrabet, an organizer with the left-wing Answer Coalition, says her group expects to bring in protesters from around the country. \"We have buses coming from Philadelphia, New York, New Haven, Boston, Chicago, cities in Florida,\" she says. The group's slogan is \"Stop the Trump Agenda.\" Mrabet says they're especially opposed to imposing new restrictions on immigrants, Muslims and women's reproductive rights. These protesters hope to be along the parade route on Inauguration Day and then to march the next day from the Trump International Hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue toward the White House. But they say they've been hampered by the National Park Service, which almost a year ago blocked off key sites for use by the Presidential Inaugural Committee. Mike Litterst, a Park Service spokesman, says this is the process that's been used for previous inaugurations. And that until Trump's Inaugural Committee decides what property it does and doesn't need for the festivities, the Park Service is unable to approve permits for the more than 20 other groups that have requested use of those sites. \"I think what a lot of people are missing is that this is a process and procedures that are established in the code of federal regulations and they are applied equally across the board, regardless of who had won,\" he says. The Answer Coalition is challenging that process in federal court, and is awaiting a decision on its appeal of an earlier ruling in favor of the government. Mara Verheyden-Hilliard, an attorney with the Partnership for Civil Justice Fund who is representing the coalition, argues that barring the protesters from federal land is unconstitutional. \"When you have an incoming administration, the people have the right to communicate to that administration what they think and what they believe,\" she says. \"And people have a right to be within sight and sound of the White House. They shouldn't have to be pushed off two miles away.\" She was referring to the Women's March, an event that organizers expect to draw as many as 200,000 protesters from around the country on Jan. 21, the day after the inauguration. The group was unable to get Park Service approval to demonstrate at the Lincoln Memorial and other sites near the White House, but it has received a permit from the D.C. government to gather near the U.S. Capitol. The group expects to march toward the White House, although the exact route is still up in the air. Mrinalini Chakraborty, one of the group's organizers in Illinois, says it was a huge relief to get the D.C. permit. She says many of those planning to join the Women's March want to send a message to President-elect Trump that they disagree with positions he took during the campaign. \"I can only hope that this massive gathering reminds him that now he's president and he represents all of us,\" says Chakraborty. Other organizations are still waiting for permits from the Park Service, but one group has received approval to use a small park along the Inaugural parade route that hadn't been set aside for the Inaugural Committee. Bikers for Trump says it expects 5,000 motorcyclists to come to town, and to gather in that park to celebrate Trump's election.",

            "article_content": "Data from exit polling show that with the exception of New Hampshire, Vermont and Wisconsin, Hillary Clinton has won women everywhere. Female votes could be crucial in a match-up with Donald Trump.  RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: Political observers like to say this sentence about Hillary Clinton. The first time she ran for president, she ran as a man. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: What the observers mean by that is that she took tough positions on security issues and did not always play up the historic nature of her candidacy. In 2016, Clinton is most certainly running as a woman whose victory would break a barrier for all women. So let's see how that is affecting women's votes. NPR's Asma Khalid is in our studios. Asma, good morning. ASMA KHALID, BYLINE: Good morning. INSKEEP: So what do the exit polls in the many primaries so far say about Democratic women voters? KHALID: Well, Hillary Clinton is doing better with some of those Democratic women than with others. Bernie Sanders does amazingly well with young women. I don't think that's a big surprise. He does well with young voters across the board, and by that, I mean women between the ages of 18 to 29, even into their early 30s. INSKEEP: This has been really frustrating for some of Hillary Clinton's biggest supporters, hasn't it? KHALID: Exactly. You might remember some of those SCAFUs early on where Madeline Albright and Gloria Steinem made some comments about young women. But this age group - millenials, we can call them - you know, they just don't vote in huge numbers.  So if you look at women as a block - as a whole group, all different age groups - Clinton actually has a major advantage. You know, there aren't exit polls for every single state that has voted so far. But all the data from all the exit polls we have show a common thread. They show that most women are voting for Clinton. That's a - you know, sort of the thing we're seeing across all states. They're supporting her over Bernie Sanders in primaries and caucuses across the country.  And, you know, Steve, there are a couple of exceptions. You know, we should point out Vermont, Bernie Sanders' home state... INSKEEP: Yeah. KHALID: ...His home turf, where he won women there by more than 60 points. New Hampshire - also another exception - and then, you know, Wisconsin on Tuesday night, that was also a - sort of not a great night for Hillary Clinton. Both her and Bernie Sanders essentially broke even with women voters. INSKEEP: Is that an ominous sign for Hillary Clinton on the women's vote? KHALID: So I don't think so. I mean, I think Wisconsin was an outlier for a number of reasons. I think there are some regional politics at play. Wisconsin borders Minnesota. That's a really progressive state; Bernie Sanders won. But the next big state is New York, and those demographics favor Clinton. You know, there could be some more exceptions going forward, but if we look at the exit polls as a whole, so far Hillary Clinton has a safety net, and it's essentially a web of women. So we went out on the campaign trail and met a cross-section of these women to talk to them about Hillary Clinton. Let's take a listen to what they had to say. ANDREA STEINBERGER: She speaks intelligently. And she talks about rights for women, such as reproductive health. CHANTEL MOSES: I identify with her immensely. You know, she's a woman. I'm a woman. KATIE LAMBERT: She really sticks up for women in politics. And I think she's just someone to really look up to. KHALID: That's Andrea Steinberger - she's a rabbi in Wisconsin - Chantel Moses, an entrepreneur in New York, and Katie Lambert, who's a college student majoring in biology. Women often say they like Clinton because she understands women's issues. But what that means kind of depends on who you're talking to. Take Angel Suit. She's a single mom in South Carolina who told me she gets up before dawn to deliver newspapers for minimum wage. ANGEL SUIT: I mean, we need better paying jobs. And that's one of my biggest issues - especially, you know, the minimum wage in South Carolina. KHALID: Women are also talking a lot about equal pay and paid family leave. I met Mary Metz recently at a Hillary event on a college campus. She's a retired professor, and she says women's concerns are complex. MARY METZ: Jobs, retirement, education, health - all the things we need to do to raise a family and take care of elders. KHALID: And it's not just domestic issues. METZ: They're interested in not having a lot of wars - trying to work things out. KHALID: Whenever I ask women why they like Hillary Clinton, they insist it's not because she's a woman.  But they inevitably admit it would be cool to elect the first woman president.  Mary Strickland works in the investment industry. It's dominated by men, and she says, yeah, gender matters. MARY STRICKLAND: I do feel that women carry the water for women's issues, whether it be reproductive rights, whether it be employment programs for women, whether it be daycare. We should have daycare provided for families throughout the United States KHALID: And Clinton, for her part, is not shy about playing the gender card. Here she is earlier this week in New York. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) HILLARY CLINTON: We still have a long way to go before we can honestly say to our daughters, yes, you can be anything you want to be, including president of the United States. KHALID: For Clinton, women are not just key in the primary.  They could be crucial in a general election. Here's the calculus. Polls show Democrats already have a built-in lead with single women. But Democratic pollster Anna Greenberg said there's another group that's highly coveted. ANNA GREENBERG: Independent women tend to be one of the most important persuadable blocks in the electorate. They also tend to be a little more socially liberal and a little more economically conservative. KHALID: And social issues often include abortion. Lisa Camooso Miller is a Republican strategist. She says when the Republican front-runner has a major misstep and says that women who seek abortions should be punished, that benefits Democrats. LISA CAMOOSO MILLER: I think now more than ever the Republican Party is in a deficit because of the words and because of the actions that Donald Trump has taken in the primary. KHALID: She worries that Trump is repelling women voters. Clinton is trying to pull them in and talks about reproductive rights pretty frequently. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CLINTON: And of course we've got to stand firm on behalf of a woman's right to make her own reproductive health care decisions. KHALID: And it's not just the rhetoric. Miller says she also worries about the tone of the GOP campaign. MILLER: That back-and-forth between the candidates, whether it's Donald Trump or anyone else, is really unattractive and unappealing to women because we are looking for solutions. KHALID: And Steve, Lisa Camooso Miller - that's the Republican strategist we just heard - she told me the tone and the message coming from the Republicans - you know, she's really worried that that could turn that traditional gender gap that the Democrats have into a gender gulf for Hillary Clinton come November. And that's a big worry. INSKEEP: What about other side of the gender gap? What about men? KHALID: You know, Steve, that's a really interesting question. Exit polls show that Clinton's had a much rockier path winning male voters so far, especially white men. In Wisconsin on Tuesday night, Bernie Sanders won resoundingly with men. He beat Clinton by about 30 points. But, you know, I will say it is important to remember here, Steve, that women make up a vast majority of voters in the Democratic primary. So, you know, maybe that doesn't matter at this point. INSKEEP: Maybe, maybe not, although, of course, you'd also worry about the general election if you're a Democrat at some point. And the electorate'll be somewhat different there, right? KHALID: Of course. INSKEEP: So that'll be a battle - men versus women. Asma, thanks very much. KHALID: Thank you.

This post was updated Oct. 1 at 10:22 a.m. This post was updated Oct. 3 at 9:16 a.m. to correct a numerical error. After a heated first debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump became the most-watched presidential debate in history last week, it's now time for the two vice presidential picks to take the stage. Clinton running mate Tim Kaine and Trump running mate Mike Pence will debate each other on Tuesday night at Longwood University in Farmville, Va. Vice presidential picks don't typically receive as much attention as the people at the top of the ticket. And while they campaign nearly as energetically as their more prominent counterparts, Kaine and Pence remain relatively unknown to many voters. On the Democratic side, Tim Kaine is a political veteran who has served at nearly every level of government. He's a former chairman of the Democratic National Committee and has been a mayor, governor, and senator. President Obama nearly picked him in 2008, but this time he got the job. He has been seen as a safe choice in an anything-but-traditional election year. Kaine himself joked about his scandal-free background on Meet The Press in June, saying, \"I am boring ... but boring is the fastest-growing demographic in this country.\" Here's what you need to know about the Virginia senator going into the vice presidential debate. Kaine started out as a lawyer in Richmond, Va., where he spent years suing landlords for discrimination against African-Americans, but his political career began on the Richmond City Council in 1994. He was later elected by the council to be the city's mayor. In 2001, Kaine was elected as Virginia's lieutenant governor and in 2005 he won election as governor. He ran for the U.S. Senate in 2012. Kaine's rise through the political world has been steady and, in some cases, with a hint of luck: He won his Senate seat four years ago when incumbent Jim Webb, a first-term senator, did not seek re-election. Kaine got the Democratic Party's nomination after no other Democrats filed to run. Kaine's opponent in that election, former Sen. George Allen, ran attack ads linking Kaine to President Obama while Kaine's campaign focused on a positive message. Kaine learned Spanish while living in Honduras in 1980 during a year off from law school. He worked at a technical school with Jesuit missionaries. In 2013, Kaine spoke in Spanish for almost 13 minutes on the Senate floor advocating for an immigration bill crafted by the bipartisan \"Gang of Eight.\" It marked the first time a senator gave a speech on the floor in a language that was not English, although others have spoken briefly in Spanish before. In the speech, Kaine said he felt it was appropriate to speak in his second language because Spanish is \"spoken by more than 40 million Americans with a huge investment in the result of this debate.\" On the campaign trail, Kaine has been teaching crowds how to say \"Ready for Hillary\" in Spanish. Like his running mate, Kaine supports expanded gun control legislation, having served as Virginia's governor during the 2007 mass shooting at Virginia Tech. In June, Kaine held the floor with other Senate Democrats for 15 hours to advocate for gun control legislation. On the floor, he spoke of his experience in the aftermath of the shooting: \"That was the worst day of my life, and it will always be the worst day of my life \u2014 comforting the families of the victims, talking to the first responders who went into a classroom where bodies littered the floor and who heard in the pockets of deceased students and professors cell phones ringing as parents who had seen it on the news were calling their kids, just knowing they were at Virginia Tech to ask them if they were all right \u2014 calls that would never be answered.\" Although a gun owner himself, he has said he supports \"common sense legislation\" to expand background checks, restrict assault-style weapons and expand mental health services. Kaine son's is an active-duty Marine, which makes Kaine one of just a few members of Congress who have a child serving in the military. In 2014, Kaine met with Virginia veterans at a momentous time in his son's military career, according to the Culpeper Star Exponent. \"My son is an infantry officer who takes control of his first platoon Monday so these are issues that matter to me personally,\" he said. Kaine has focused on military and foreign policy in Congress, serving on the Senate Armed Services Committee. In an interview on MSNBC's Morning Joe, Kaine attacked Trump for criticizing the military. \"When I hear Donald Trump say the American military is a disaster, I want to go through the screen and shake the guy,\" Kaine said in the interview. \"We ought to have a commander in chief who talks about our troops with respect and gratitude.\" He has been critical of the Obama administration for not seeking re-authorization from Congress in the fight against ISIS. The administration has been using a 2001 use-of-force authorization to allow the American military to engage the terrorist group. As NPR has reported, the original law authorizing military force was signed in 2001 and gave the president the power to use force against groups which aided the September 11 attacks, not terrorists in general. That's a point where Clinton and Kaine disagree. During a November debate on CBS, when asked whether she would declare war on ISIS, Clinton said the U.S. already has \"an authorization to use military force against terrorists\" that we passed after 9/11. When asked if that covers ISIS, she said yes: \"It certainly does cover it.\" Kaine has called himself a \"traditional Catholic,\" and says he personally opposes abortion. However, the senator said in a June Meet The Press interview that he doesn't let his personal beliefs affect his position on the issue. He said he believes the decision of whether or not to have an abortion shouldn't be dictated by the government: \"I deeply believe, and not just as a matter of politics, but even as a matter of morality, that matters about reproduction and intimacy and relationships and contraception are in the personal realm. They're moral decisions for individuals to make for themselves. And the last thing we need is government intruding into those personal decisions.\" In August 2015, Kaine voted against defunding Planned Parenthood. In a statement at the time, he said that for many women, \"Planned Parenthood health centers are their only source of high quality health care.\" Kaine is a self-professed \"harmonica enthusiast.\" He has played the instrument for over two decades, according to Roll Call, and has been known to make appearances with it on and off the campaign trail. In an interview with the Washington Post, Kaine joked that his harmonica is actually a safety net. \"In politics you've got to have a fallback in our line of work because your career can be over in an instant,\" Kaine told the Post. \"Not that I would make much money playing a harmonica.\" But he also told the Post that he's not very good. \"I've had people comment less than favorably on my quality. My wife is the most honest,\" Kaine said. \"She says, 'Hey, you ought to play anytime they ask you because as soon as you're not in elected office, they're not going to ask you anymore.'\"",

Mitch McConnell and President-elect Donald Trump have big plans for the new year with their party controlling both the White House and Congress.\n                \n                    \n                    Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption House Speaker Paul Ryan and fellow Republican leaders Sen. Mitch McConnell and President-elect Donald Trump have big plans for the new year with their party controlling both the White House and Congress. Just before House Republicans re-elected Paul Ryan as their speaker, the Wisconsin Republican made a bold proclamation. \"Welcome to the dawn of a new unified Republican government,\" Ryan told reporters one week after Election Day. \"This will be a government focused on turning President-elect Trump's victory into real progress for the American people.\" Ryan continued: \"If we are going to put our country back on the right track, we have got to be bold, and we have to go big.\" That \"be bold, go big\" agenda is still in its early planning stages, but Ryan, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and incoming President Donald Trump have outlined plans to repeal and replace Obamacare, overhaul the federal tax code, slash federal regulations, invest in infrastructure projects and seal the U.S.-Mexico border. All told, it's a legislative program that would affect every single person and business in America. A lot can get done in the first two years Recent history is on the GOP's side. When the White House and Congress have been controlled by the same party, Washington has produced some of the most sweeping \u2014 albeit politically polarizing \u2014 legislation aimed at shifting the political trajectory of the nation toward the cause of the party in power. In particular, the first two-year congressional session of a new administration \u2014 when public approval is generally at its highest for the incoming president \u2014 has produced some recent presidents' most memorable legislative imprints. President Obama's health care law and Wall Street overhaul both passed in 2010 under Democratic control and along party lines. President George W. Bush signed the No Child Left Behind education law and the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act into law and enacted a round of tax cuts, as well as legislation that created the Department of Homeland Security after the Sept. 11 attacks in his first two years in the Oval Office. (Senate control flipped back and forth in 2001 and 2002 due to the defection of Sen. Jim Jeffords of Vermont from the GOP, but Republicans controlled Congress for the majority of Bush's first term in office.) President Bill Clinton signed the Family Medical Leave Act, gun-control legislation, including an assault weapons ban, and legislation to prevent and prosecute violence toward women before Democrats lost control of Congress in the 1994 wave election. \"Put up and show up\" McConnell has already outlined Republicans' plans to take aim at Obamacare and initiate an overhaul of the tax code in 2017. They also want to use the same budget rules that were used in the past to enact Bush's tax cuts and Obama's health care bill, because certain budget bills can't be filibustered in the Senate. \"The two biggest impediments to growth in our country are over-regulation and the tax structure,\" McConnell said. \"And the president-elect seems to be committed to addressing both of those, and the Republican majorities in the House and Senate are as well.\" Incoming White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus told conservative talk-radio host Hugh Hewitt that the first nine months of 2017 will be \"consumed\" by health care and tax legislative pushes. \"Now, it's time for being in the majority,\" Priebus said, \"and I can tell you President-elect Trump is going to lead the way to put up and show up.\" Democrats are skeptical Republicans will go through with it. Despite years of unanimous opposition to the law, the GOP has never found consensus on how to replace it. \"They don't know what to do,\" incoming Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told reporters before Congress adjourned for the year. \"They have nothing to put in its place and, believe me, just repealing Obamacare, even though they have nothing to put in its place and saying they'll do it sometime down the road, will cause huge calamity from one end of America to the other.\" Retiring Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid warned Republicans against dismantling the health care law. \"It will lead you into a quagmire that will cause pain for millions of Americans and bedevil you for the next four years,\" he wrote in a New York Times opinion piece. Is a Medicare overhaul coming? Democrats like Reid and Schumer believe Republicans have misinterpreted the results of the 2016 election, with Trump claiming a mandate despite losing the popular vote and entering office with historically high negative ratings. Many Democrats say GOP efforts to dismantle Obamacare will hurt the party in the same way Bush's 2005 push to overhaul Social Security damaged the party and played a role in the Democratic takeover of Congress in 2006. \"We had a plan. We stuck with it. It was unified, strategic and unwavering,\" said House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., of the 2005 entitlement fight. Pelosi said Democrats won that legislative fight despite Bush enjoying high approval ratings at the time. That fight provides the blueprint Democrats are expected to follow next year to defend Obamacare and, potentially, GOP efforts to reshape Medicare. Ryan has long been a proponent of overhauling Medicare for future retirees from a guaranteed benefit to a premium support system in which seniors are given subsidies to purchase health insurance from the private market. Ryan will have a powerful ally next year: Rep. Tom Price, R-Ga., Trump's nominee for Health and Human Services Secretary, shares Ryan's view on Medicare. But old rules and battle lines are unreliable future predictors for a Trump administration. At the risk of understatement, the incoming president has succeeded by defying political norms with a brand that appeals to the older, white voters that Democrats used to be able to rely on to scare Republicans away from touching entitlement programs. The \"Trump Wing\" has the upper hand among Republicans The Republican Party also remains philosophically divided between the traditional, interventionist, fiscal hawk \"Ryan Wing\" and the populist, isolationist \"Trump Wing\" of the party. Early signals point to the Trump Wing having the upper hand at the start. When Trump intervened with Indiana-based Carrier Corp. to pressure the company to remain in the U.S., Ryan, a staunch free-market conservative, applauded. \"Well, I'm pretty happy that we're keeping jobs in America, aren't you?\" Ryan said. Notably, one of the few voices of opposition to Trump was former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin \u2014 an icon of the Tea Party movement \u2014 who called out the Carrier intervention as crony capitalism. It barely made a ripple. Another sign the Trump Wing of the party is ascendant: Ryan \u2014 long described as a rising star in the party \u2014 was booed at a Trump political rally in his home state of Wisconsin. Trump came to his defense. \"[Ryan] has been terrific and, you know, honestly, he is like a fine wine. Every day goes by I get to appreciate his genius more and more,\" Trump said, before adding a vaguely threatening disclaimer: \"Now, if he ever goes against me, I'm not going to say that.\" It should be noted: Trump doesn't drink. \"I'm tired of divided government\" Ryan understands that 2017 is the best chance he will have in his political career so far to advance the causes he cares about. He recently discussed his discontent with divided government, which Washington has been operating under for the the past six years, a period that largely has been defined by polarization and obstruction, shutdown battles and ideological intransigence. \"I'm tired of divided government. It doesn't work very well,\" Ryan lamented a week prior to Election Day. \"We've gotten some good things done. But the big things \u2014 poverty, the debt crisis, the economy, health care \u2014 these things are stuck in divided government, and that's why we think a unified Republican government's the way to go.\" Up close, Congress has not been as unproductive as the public believes. Major legislation affecting health care, highways, public education and taxes has worked its way through the legislative process and made it to Obama's desk these past six years. One of the president's last acts was signing a sweeping $6.3 billion biomedical research bill that, among other ambitious goals, advances the cause of finding a cure for cancer. But the big, ideological battles over the size and scope of government have gone unsettled. Next year, Republicans will have their best chance in more than a decade to win the next chapter in that never-ending struggle and, maybe, redefine what it means to be a Republican in the Trump era.",

            "article_content": "Michel Martin reflects on the divides that seemed particularly prevalent during and after the 2016 election, and what comes next.  MICHEL MARTIN, HOST: Finally, if you've been listening this weekend, then you know we turned over yesterday's entire hour to reflections from people with whom we've been speaking over the course of the election year. This included people who identify as Republican and Democrat and neither, people who supported Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton or neither. We wanted to hear what they had to say about the election and what they see going forward. From all the calls and letters we've already gotten, we can tell that emotions are still quite raw. We get that. But we thought it was important at a time when debate hasn't been all that edifying to just let people talk, even if we knew you wouldn't like what some of our guests had to say. So now, since I sometimes write a few words after a big news story, I hope it's OK if I offer my take. Can I just tell you, I think the wounds both exposed by and caused by this election are real, and it will take both correct diagnosis and appropriate treatment to heal them? And it's going to take a long time. First, to the wounds. You probably heard a lot by now about the many differences in voting preference between people of different races, genders and education levels. And while that's important to me, it's almost beside the point. To me, the bigger issue is the pain that is real, that is shared, that is persistent and that is felt across so much of the country. But it's not shared equally. And it's certainly not equally visible. We brought you a small story last week that reiterated this point. It was about the millions of manufacturing jobs that have been lost in the U.S. in just the last few years. There were 19 million manufacturing jobs in 1978. There are just 12 million today. Five million of those jobs have been lost since the year 2000 alone, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Taken together, those jobs tell stories, houses that are now worth less, retirements that are less certain, college educations that are more necessary but less attainable. Sure, manufacturing jobs are just one slice of a bigger story, but they are a story. Restructuring is something you read about. It's a layoff when it's happening to you. Somebody can tell you 24 hours a day that technology and globalization brings more goods at lower prices. But if you're on the losing end of it, so what? And when you are drowning, facing wages that disappear or don't keep up with your bills, when you feel you can't get ahead no matter how hard you try, you'll grab the rope that's thrown to you. And most people, I dare say, won't care if the person throwing the rope is black or white or speaks the King's English or yaps like a junkyard dog, or even, frankly, if the person throwing it to you seems to turn his back on everyone else. That's how it is when you're drowning. Who among us will toss what he thinks is a lifeline to someone else first, even if the choice to save you first causes a rift that hurts like hell if eventually both of you manage to make it to shore? That to me explains how it is that some of the same counties that went strong for Obama in 2008 went for Trump in 2016. And that's also why I say the wounds opened up by this aren't going to close right away. But it doesn't matter if you correctly diagnose a problem if the prescription is all wrong. A doctor who figures out that you have lung cancer but treats you by cutting off your leg is still committing malpractice. And that to me is why it has been and remains so unproductive to focus on perceived enemies rather than real problems, no matter how deplorable or alien you think the enemy may be. Consider the example of the drug addiction crisis. Could it be that the reason we've never really conquered any addiction crisis, whether alcohol, heroin or opioids, is that we're too accustomed to seeing it as just a problem certain people have people, people we generally just ignore or imprison, as opposed to a problem to be solved? Could it be that the reason we let our economy become so unbalanced is that we decided that the people on the losing end were just, well, losers or too far gone to save? Elections, as painful as they often are, as this one surely was, are a second opinion. Let's hope for the sake of the body politic that the diagnosis and the treatment are worthy of the pain.

            "article_content": "Even for an election year, 2016 is turning out to be a particularly unproductive year for Congress. House GOP leaders are struggling to pass a budget \u2014 a modest goal at best \u2014 while other legislative items are getting punted until after the election.  ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: In case you're concerned that all the drama around the presidential race has distracted you from paying attention to what Congress is doing, don't worry. Congress has been distracted, too. 2016 is proving to be, like election years past, short on meaty legislation and short on weeks in session as members use much of the year to campaign. Here's NPR's Ailsa Chang. AILSA CHANG, BYLINE: If there's such a thing as the perfect time to demand sweeping reforms from Congress, you can safely bet that the middle of an election year is not that time. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: (Chanting) Whose house? UNIDENTIFIED CROWD: (Chanting) Our house. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: (Chanting) Whose house? UNIDENTIFIED CROWD: (Chanting) Our house. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: (Chanting) Whose house? CHANG: So you got to hand it to these protesters. They've been staging sit ins and getting arrested by the hundreds all week at the Capitol to push for campaign finance reform. But why even bother in 2016? That's what Sue Kirby is wondering. She came all the way from Salem, Mass., for this. SUE KIRBY: We've all gotten to the point we almost don't expect them to do anything but especially this year. I mean not being willing to consider the Supreme Court nomination - they've just sat down and stopped doing their job. CHANG: It's getting so sluggish on Capitol Hill even academics are getting bored. Sarah Binder teaches a course on Congress at George Washington University, and usually at the beginning of every class, she spends 15 minutes talking about what Congress is working on. SARAH BINDER: This year, oh, there's so little going on. I'm two days ahead on my syllabus (laughter), all right? I'm just dying for news, and there's only so many times we can count up Republicans who are willing to have breakfast with Judge Garland for the Supreme Court. CHANG: Lawmakers never declared bold ambitions this election year, but now they're slow-walking even modest legislative goals. Criminal justice reform keeps getting put on ice - same with emergency funding to fight the Zika virus. There's no chance Congress will vote on the Pacific Rim trade deal before the election, and Democrat Dan Kildee can't believe his colleagues are still deadlocked over what to do about lead poisoning in Flint, Mich. That's his district. DAN KILDEE: Here we have a major crisis, a community of a hundred thousand people, and Congress can't act to provide even the basic kind of help for this community. There's no excuse for it. This is a do-nothing Congress like nothing we've seen before. CHANG: But there seems to be plenty of time to think about other things. Last month, one House member introduced a measure that would nationally recognized magic as an art form. Kildee was not amused. KILDEE: We've spent whole week's naming post offices, you know, which is little but ironic because it kind of feels like - what? - we have to name these post offices before the other side can vote to close them. CHANG: Now, some lawmakers do take issue with how people are measuring their productivity this election year. Here's Republican Mo Brooks of Alabama. MO BROOKS: It appears that you have a much different view of the word productive than I do. CHANG: What's your view? BROOKS: Killing bad things is very productive, and we have been very successful at killing bad things. CHANG: Like what? BROOKS: Like the budget. CHANG: Yeah, about that budget - that was supposed to be one of the doable things this year because a budget deal already passed last year. But conservative House Republicans still think the spending limit set by that deal were too high, so now the budget's going nowhere. Meanwhile, in the Senate, Republicans say they've done plenty this year, like bills on North Korea sanctions and on opioid addiction. And Republican John McCain of Arizona says it's still early. JOHN MCCAIN: We organize in January and February, and we're now in April, OK? So let's see what happens in the next few months before we start making judgments. CHANG: But this election year, Congress is scheduled to be out much of July, all of August and pretty much all of October, too. Ailsa Chang, NPR News, the Capitol. Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.

In the Washington of 2016, even when the policy can be bipartisan, the politics cannot. And in that sense, this year shows little sign of ending on Dec. 31. When President Obama moved to sanction Russia over its alleged interference in the U.S. election just concluded, some Republicans who had long called for similar or more severe measures could scarcely bring themselves to approve. House Speaker Paul Ryan called the Obama measures \"appropriate\" but also \"overdue\" and \"a prime example of this administration's ineffective foreign policy that has left America weaker in the eyes of the world.\" Other GOP leaders sounded much the same theme. \"[We have] been urging President Obama for years to take strong action to deter Russia's worldwide aggression, including its cyber-hacking operations,\" wrote Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. \"Now with just a few weeks left in office, the president has suddenly decided that some stronger measures are indeed warranted.\" Appearing on CNN, frequent Obama critic Trent Franks, R-Ariz., called for \"much tougher\" actions and said three times that Obama had \"finally found his tongue.\" Meanwhile, at Mar-a-Lago and on Fox News, various spokesmen for President-elect Trump said Obama's real target was not the Russians at all but the man poised to take over the White House in less than three weeks. They spoke of Obama trying to \"tie Trump's hands\" or \"box him in,\" meaning the president-elect would be forced either to keep the sanctions or be at odds with Republicans who want to be tougher still on Moscow. Throughout 2016, Trump has repeatedly called not for sanctions but for closer ties with Russia, including cooperation in the fight against ISIS. Russia has battled ISIS in Syria on behalf of that country's embattled dictator, Bashar Assad, bombing the besieged rebel-held city of Aleppo that fell to Assad's forces this week. During the campaign, Trump even urged Russia to \"find\" missing emails from the private server of his opponent, Hillary Clinton. He has exchanged public encomiums with Russian President Vladimir Putin on several occasions and added his doubts about the current U.S. levels of support for NATO \u2014 Putin's longtime nemesis. There have also been suggestions that Trump's extensive business dealings with various Russians are the reason he refuses to release his tax returns. All those issues have been disquieting to some Republicans for many months. Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., prominent senior members of the Armed Services Committee, have accepted the assessment of 17 U.S. intelligence agencies regarding the role of Russia in the hacking of various Democratic committees last year. That includes the FBI and CIA consensus that the Russian goal was not just to discredit American democracy but to defeat Clinton and elect Trump. They say the great majority of their Senate colleagues agree with them, and McCain has slated an Armed Services hearing on cyberthreats for Jan. 5. But the politicizing of the Russian actions \u2014 the idea that they helped Trump win \u2014 has also made the issue difficult for Republican leaders. It has allowed Trump supporters to push back on the intelligence agencies and say the entire issue is designed to undermine Trump's legitimacy. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has so far resisted calls for a select committee to look into the Russian interference in the 2016 campaign. He has said it is enough for Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., to look into it as chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. Typically, Republican leaders and spokesmen say there is no evidence that the actual voting or tallying on Nov. 8 was compromised, and that is true. But it is also a red herring, as interference in those functions has not been alleged and is not the focus of the U.S. intelligence agencies' concern. For his part, Trump has shown little interest in delving into what happened. He has cast doubt on the U.S. intelligence reports to date and suggested \"no one really knows what happened.\" He also has suggested that computers make it very difficult to know who is using them. This week, Trump said it was time to \"get on with our lives and do more important things.\" However, at week's end he did agree to have an intelligence briefing on the subject next week. The president-elect has not wanted the daily intelligence briefings available to him in recent weeks, preferring that they be given to the men he has chosen as his vice president (Mike Pence) and national security adviser (Mike Flynn), with Trump taking them only occasionally. The irony of this controversy arising at the eleventh hour of the Obama presidency can scarcely be overstated, and it defines the dilemma facing both the outgoing president and the incoming party in control. Obama appears to have been reluctant to retaliate against the Russian hacking before the election for fear of seeming to interfere with the election himself. The Republicans, meanwhile, have for years called for greater confrontation with the Russians, with Obama usually resisting. Obama did join with NATO in punishing the Russians with economic sanctions over the annexation of Crimea. Those sanctions may have been painful, coming as they did alongside falling prices for oil \u2014 the commodity that keeps the Russian economy afloat. On other occasions, despite Russian provocations through surrogates in Syria and elsewhere, Obama did not make overt moves to force Russia's hand. That includes occasions when Russia was believed to be hacking critical computer systems in neighboring Ukraine, Estonia and Poland. But this week, following a chorus of confirmation from the U.S. intelligence community regarding the Russian role in computer hacking in the political campaign, Obama acted. He imposed a set of mostly diplomatic actions such as sanctioning some Russian officials, closing two diplomatic compounds and expelling 35 Russian diplomats. There may have been more damaging measures taken covertly, and some Russophobes in Washington held out hope for that. But the visible portion of the program scarcely amounted to major retribution. And Putin saw fit to diminish the Obama sanctions further by declining to respond. Although his government has steadfastly denied any interference in the U.S. election, Putin rejected his own foreign minister's recommended package of tit-for-tat responses. (He even sent an invitation for U.S. diplomats to send their children to a holiday party in Moscow.) That allowed Putin to appear for the moment to be \"the bigger man,\" even as he spurned Obama and kept up what has looked like a public bromance with Trump, who tweeted: \"Great move on delay (by V. Putin) - I always knew he was very smart!\" Great move on delay (by V. Putin) - I always knew he was very smart! At the moment it may seem that the overall Russia question amounts to the first crisis facing the Trump presidency. Whether forced by this campaign interference issue or not, Trump must grasp the nettle of a relationship Mitt Romney once called the greatest threat to U.S. security in the world. To be sure, Trump needs to dispel doubts about his ability to stand up to Putin, who has bullied and cajoled his way to center stage in recent world affairs. But Trump also seems determined to turn the page on past U.S. commitments, from free trade philosophy to funding of NATO and the United Nations. And if his Twitter account is any guide, Trump shows little concern about the conundrum others perceive to be facing him. Above all, Trump has shown himself determined to play by his own rules. A year ago, many were confident that would not work for him in the world of presidential politics. We are about to find out whether it works for him in the Oval Office.",

Pictured here, the Democratic presidential candidate walks off the stage after speaking in New York on Nov. 9. Hillary Clinton has kept a low profile since losing the election to Donald Trump, but at a private event before donors Thursday night, she blamed her loss, in part, on \"some unprecedented factors\" \u2014 namely Russian hacking and the letter about the investigation into her email server released by FBI Director James Comey days before the election. \"Vladimir Putin himself directed the covert cyberattacks against our electoral system, against our democracy, apparently because he has a personal beef against me,\" Clinton said, per audio obtained by The New York Times. The event, for campaign donors, was closed to the press. In the remarks, Clinton ties the \"beef\" to the country's parliamentary elections in 2011, which as secretary of state, Clinton said were \"unfair, not free, illegitimate.\" Around the time of those elections, Russian citizens took to the streets to protest Putin's power grab. \"Putin publicly blamed me for the outpouring of outrage by his own people,\" Clinton said. \"And that is the direct line between what he said back then and what he did in this election.\" These were Clinton's most extensive remarks to date about the Russian hacking, how it may have related to her electoral loss and the origins of what NBC termed as Putin's \"vendetta\" against Clinton. Clinton has previously blamed the FBI, in part, for her loss. Her campaign staff also has talked about the FBI's role in the election earlier this month at a conference at Harvard's Institute of Politics examining the election results. Clinton's team blamed FBI Director James Comey's two letters in the final days of the campaign as well as Russian-linked hacking of the Democratic National Committee and campaign Chairman John Podesta's personal Gmail account. The argument, one which Clinton repeated last night, is that voters who were undecided until the end broke for Trump because of the Comey letter and the swirling controversy linked to daily WikiLeaks posts of internal campaign emails. In a Washington Post op-ed published Thursday night, Podesta argued the FBI's priorities were off, given that the agency apparently put more emphasis on investigating Clinton's use of a private email server while secretary of state than Russian interference in the U.S. election. \"Comparing the FBI's massive response to the overblown email scandal with the seemingly lackadaisical response to the very real Russian plot to subvert a national election shows that something is deeply broken at the FBI,\" Podesta wrote. Clinton herself attempted to argue that it was bigger than herself, saying she was pleased to see a bipartisan group of senators calling for an investigation into the hacking. \"This is an attack against our country. We are well beyond normal political concerns here,\" Clinton said. \"This is about the integrity of our democracy and the security of our nation.\" President-elect Trump, however, continues to downplay the significance of the hacking, questioning whether it really was Russia: Are we talking about the same cyberattack where it was revealed that head of the DNC illegally gave Hillary the questions to the debate? The Senate Intelligence Committee released a statement, describing how it plans to proceed with its investigation into the hacking, and the intelligence community's conclusion that it was directed by people at the highest levels of the Russian government. \"Majority Leader McConnell and incoming Minority Leader Schumer have made it clear they expect any review of Russia's involvement in our nation's elections to be conducted in a bipartisan manner,\" the intelligence committee's statement reads. \"It is a charge the [committee] takes seriously.\" The statement also says the committee will carry out the investigation expeditiously, \"but we will take the time to get it right and will not be influenced by uninformed discourse.\" Some hearings will be public, but much of the work will be conducted behind closed doors because of the sensitive nature of the committee's work. As for the results of the election, some Democratic Party donors who spoke to Politico questioned whether the focus from Clinton's team on Comey and Russia is productive, saying a full postmortem of what went wrong in the campaign is still needed.

            "article_content": "Media executives and anchors from the top five TV networks met with the president-elect at Trump Tower on Monday.\n                \n                    \n                    Mark Lennihan/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Media executives and anchors from the top five TV networks met with the president-elect at Trump Tower on Monday. Updated 12:01 p.m. ET Tuesday, with additional details. President-elect Donald Trump invited a large group of television news anchors and executives from the nation's leading networks on Monday to reset a relationship that had badly frayed during a contentious campaign. First, Trump gave them a piece of his mind. He castigated the networks for what he said was unfair coverage. Trump, top aides and advisers including Kellyanne Conway, Reince Priebus and Sean Spicer met with executives and anchors from five major television networks at Trump Tower in New York City. In addition to admonishing the networks he also said he wanted to re-frame his relationship with the press and took extensive questions about policy and his intentions in office. This account is largely based on an interview with an attendee who took detailed notes. Among the participants from the news side were: ABC's George Stephanopoulos and David Muir; NBC's Lester Holt and NBC News President Deborah Turness; CBS' John Dickerson, Gayle King and Norah O'Donnell; Fox News' Bill Shine and Jay Wallace; MSNBC's Phil Griffin; and CNN's Wolf Blitzer and Jeff Zucker. The substance of the meeting was supposed to be off the record. While an off-the-record meeting is unusual, it's not unprecedented. Presidents periodically reach out to influential journalists to shape their coverage and improve understanding of their administrations' priorities. It is not unusual for Washington bureau chiefs to meet with administration officials to discuss logistics or to iron out disagreements that arise. Such meetings are often designated off the record, though details frequently leak out. But many participants were photographed as they entered through the Trump Tower lobby. The New York Post's Page Six gossip site had a detailed version that appeared to put the event in the most commanding light possible as Trump dressed down the nation's TV news elite. Trump started the meeting by saying how great it was for so many network news anchors to be there, calling it unprecedented and citing it as a reflection of the importance of his election. Blitzer noted that such meetings are a fairly common annual ritual between presidents and anchors ahead of State of the Union addresses. Trump then said the presence of the executives is what made the meeting unprecedented. Trump lit out after Zucker, criticizing his former business partner (Zucker was head of NBC during Trump's Apprentice franchise on the network). He turned then to NBC, saying it's the worst, criticizing its reporters and saying it could not even come up with a flattering picture to broadcast. His complaint: photographs showing him with multiple chins. NBC's Turness replied that wasn't true, saying it was currently using a photograph showing Trump in a very flattering way. Trump also criticized a reporter who he said was in the room, who had moderated a debate but who he had been told was very upset when Hillary Clinton lost. Presumably that was a reference to ABC's Martha Raddatz or NBC's Lester Holt. Conway interceded to say that the new Trump administration appreciated the press corps' hard work during the campaign and wanted a reset on its relationship with the press. Trump concurred and repeated the point, though he said he dislikes the phrase \"reset\" because it reminds him of Clinton's initial outreach to Russia when she was starting as secretary of state. Trump said he wants a relationship with the press that is \"cordial and productive.\" CBS' Gayle King asked what would constitute such a relationship, but it wasn't clear what that meant beyond off-the-record meetings such as that one, according to the participant in the meeting who spoke to NPR. After that first 10 to 15 minutes, according to the attendee, Trump invited questions about his policies, appointments and intentions, showing an interest in details and implications. The participant who spoke to NPR said Trump appeared as though he was irritated but working the refs, as when President George W. Bush complained during his presidency that the press was acting as the filter of his remarks and policies. However, a second source \u2014 a network official debriefed by colleagues who attended \u2014 said it did not feel like a reset of the relationship. The off-the-record meeting lasted about an hour. Trump later posted a video on social media \u2014 bypassing the conventional press \u2014 to explain to the public, on the record, how the presidential transition was proceeding.",

            "article_content": "I was in a Brooklyn coffee shop when a woman, an apparent regular, leaned over to the barista and relayed an unnerving scene she witnessed on the subway: A Muslim man asked another passenger what stop to take for the ferry to the Statue of Liberty. The passenger, a white man, responded, \"Why, so you can go bomb it?\" The Muslim man explained that he was on vacation and that he'd always dreamed of taking his family to see the landmark. Other passengers joined in with the first one, taunting the man and questioning his motives as his two young children and wife looked on. \"And this happened in New York City!\" the woman at the coffee shop said. Then came a sentence that's been ringing in my head ever since: \"Donald Trump has given people permission to be racist.\" With Trump's election last week, that permission becomes encouragement. If you spew vitriol against minorities, you can rise to the highest office in the land. How could that be anything but a green light for hatred? Just a day after enough Americans -- even young men and college-educated women \u2014 gave Trump the presidency, the hateful acts began. On election night, someone painted a swastika along with the words \"MAKE AMERICA WHITE AGAIN\" on the wall of a softball dugout in Wellsville, N.Y. Men invoking Trump robbed a Muslim woman on the San Diego State University campus the day after the election. For many, it's no surprise that such racial animus has come with Trump's victory. After all, derision was an essential part of his campaign, which promised to \"make America great again.\" And that greatness evokes a time before the country had the racial diversity we see today. According to the nonprofit research organization PRRI, seven in 10 Trump supporters said America has changed for the worse since 1950. Back then, less than 1 percent of the country was any race other than white or black (compared to 24 percent today). The election results make official a nostalgia for a whiter America. The election results make official a nostalgia for a whiter America. I'm a Muslim-American and the daughter of immigrants. It has not been easy for me to get out of bed in a country where such opinions were affirmed at the ballot box. I woke up the morning after the election in a world I recognize, but hardly know. I woke up in Ohio, a battleground state awash in red. I woke up thinking about my neighbors \u2014 all the old white couples we send cookies to on Christmas. The new black family whose son asked for a cup of milk on Tuesday. (My mother gave him the whole gallon.) I thought this was what America meant. Now, I can't help but feel that the 52 percent of my fellow Ohioans who voted for Trump want my family and me out. I look at my neighborhood and this is all I can think. Because it's predominantly white and upper-middle class, it likely leaned even more toward Trump. This is what that \"silent majority,\" which Trump named as his fan base, has been clamoring for: The right to screen and assess us. The right to deport us en masse. America has been yearning for a past that was as white as fresh snow before our muddy brown boots stomped through it. The country has been telling us this all along. We just didn't want to hear it. We didn't want to hear that Americans are uncomfortable with Muslims, even when half of all governors in the country said they oppose accepting the most desperate members of our faith group \u2014 those who have lived through the devastating war in Syria. We ignored the refrain \"they're taking our jobs\" by telling ourselves we're productive members of this society. We turned the other cheek whenever someone said, \"Go back to where you came from.\" And so, here we are. Trump has made it OK to shout at us loud enough for the message to come in clearly: We don't belong. In the final hours of election night, strangers filled my professional Facebook page as never before with the sort of vitriol Trump's campaign used as fuel. This is just what I can show you. The others are too vulgar. For so many black and brown folks, this is the America we didn't want to believe we lived in. Now we know better. The concern is no longer that fellow passengers on a subway will insult a Muslim family on their way to the Statue of Liberty. The concern is that insults will be the least of their worries.",

            "article_content": "I've noticed two distinct ways social media have changed the way we talk to each other about politics. Clearly, they have changed a lot, maybe everything, but two fairly new phenomena stand out. One happens on Facebook all the time. Just about all of your friends are posting about the election, nonstop. And there are a few who brag about deleting friends, or who urge friends to unfriend them over their political leanings: \"Just unfriend me now.\" Or something like \"If you can't support candidate X/Y, we don't need to be friends anymore.\" Or \"Congrats, if you're reading this, you survived my friend purge!\" Etc. You know how it goes. This public declaration, if not celebration, of the end of friendships because of politics. And then on Twitter, there's the public shaming of those who dare disagree with or insult you. (I am guilty of this.) Someone tweets at you with something incendiary, bashing the article you just shared or the point you just made, mocking something you said about politics, calling you stupid. You quote the tweet, maybe sarcastically, to prove it doesn't affect you. But it does! You tweeted it back, to all of your followers. It's an odd cycle. A rebuttal of nasty political exchanges by highlighting nasty political exchanges. This is our present political social life: We don't just create political strife for ourselves; we seem to revel in it. When we look back on the role that sites like Twitter, Facebook (and Instagram and Snapchat and all the others) have played in our national political discourse this election season, it would be easy to spend most of our time examining Donald Trump's effect on these media, particularly Twitter. It's been well-documented; Trump may very well have the most combative online presence of any candidate for president in modern history. But underneath that glaring and obvious conclusion, there's a deeper story about how the very DNA of social media platforms and the way people use them has trickled up through our political discourse and affected all of us, almost forcing us to wallow in the divisive waters of our online conversation. And it all may have helped make Election 2016 one of the most unbearable ever. A problem with format Fully understanding just how social media have changed our national political conversation means understanding what these platforms were initially intended to do, and how we use them now. Both the technology itself, and the way we choose to use the technology, makes it so that what ought to be a conversation is just a set of Post-it notes that are scattered. Kerric Harvey, author, the Encyclopedia of Social Media and Politics At its core, Twitter is a messaging service allowing users (who can remain anonymous) to tweet out information, or opinions, or whatever, in 140-character bursts. For many critics, that DNA makes Twitter antithetical to sophisticated, thoughtful political conversation. \"Both the technology itself, and the way we choose to use the technology, makes it so that what ought to be a conversation is just a set of Post-it notes that are scattered,\" Kerric Harvey, author of the Encyclopedia of Social Media and Politics, said of Twitter. \"Not even on the refrigerator door, but on the ground.\" She argues that what we do on Twitter around politics isn't a conversation at all; it's a loud mess. Bridget Coyne, a senior manager at Twitter, points to several features the company has added to those 140-character tweets: polls, photos, video, Moments and more. She also told NPR that the 140-character limit reflects the app's start as a mobile-first platform, and that it's different now. \"We've evolved into a website and many other platforms from that.\" And she, like every other spokesman for any major social media platform, argues that sites like Twitter have democratized the political conversation, helping give everyone a voice, and that's a good thing. But even accepting that point, and respecting every new addition to Twitter's list of tools, we find a way to keep arguing. Even the candidates do it. One particular exchange between Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush (remember him?) illustrates this new political reality. On Aug. 10, 2015, Clinton's Twitter account posted a graphic with the words: \"$1.2 trillion, the amount 40 million Americans owe in student debt.\" Cost won't be a barrier to an education. Debt won't hold you back. Read Hillary's plan: https://t.co/A4pWb3fOf4 pic.twitter.com/KVyr8SlSVn Jeb Bush's campaign replied, tweaking Clinton's own graphic to read \"100%, The increase in student debt under this Democratic White House.\" @HillaryClinton pic.twitter.com/m6LAHYCLok Those two tweets seem reasonable enough. But there was more. In response to the Bush campaign's response, Team Clinton scratched out the words in Bush's redone graphic, added its own scribbled letters, and etched a large \"F\" on top, for the \"grade given to Florida for college affordability under Jeb Bush's leadership.\" The campaign tweeted the image with the caption \"Fixed it for you.\" .@JebBush Fixed it for you. pic.twitter.com/d4q9EWpXCA And then, the Bush account replied once more, turning Clinton's \"H\" logo, with its right-pointing arrow, by 90 degrees, sending the arrow point skyward, with the word \"taxes\" printed behind over and over. That caption was \"fixed your logo for you.\" .@HillaryClinton fixed your logo for you. pic.twitter.com/141nXHQe4Z It was an exchange nearing petty; these two candidates were trolling each other. But for the most part it seemed totally normal in a campaign season like this one, and in the digital age in which we live. Establishment political figures like Bush and Clinton (or at least their young staffers) had co-opted the language of social media and mastered the formats, with all the snark and back and forth that come along with it, and with an extra incentive to adopt some of the meanness Trump has exhibited online. There may be even more problems for Twitter than what real live people are doing on the app. A recent study conducted by a research team at Oxford University found that during the period of time between the first presidential debate and the second, one-third of pro-Trump tweets and nearly one-fifth of pro-Clinton tweets came from automated accounts. Douglas Guilbeault, one of the researchers in the study, told NPR that hurts political discourse. \"They reinforce the sense of polarization in the atmosphere,\" he said. \"Because bots don't tend to be mild-mannered, judicial critics. They are programmed to align themselves with an agenda that is unambiguously representative of a particular party. ... It's all 'Crooked Hillary' and 'Trump is a puppet.' \" So, if Twitter is a bunch of Post-it notes thrown on the ground, we now have to consider which of those notes are even real. The company would not offer its own estimate on the number of bots on its app, or any on-the-record rebuttal to the study's findings, besides the following statement: \"Anyone claiming that spam accounts on Twitter are distorting the national, political conversation is misinformed.\" Even if there are questions about the number of bots on Twitter, the tone of the conversation there increasingly can't be denied. A recent study from the Anti-Defamation League found \"a total of 2.6 million tweets containing language frequently found in anti-Semitic speech were posted across Twitter between August 2015 and July 2016,\" with many aimed at political journalists. And a Bloomberg report found trolling on the service is keeping the company from finding a buyer. Facebook and the \"echo chamber\" Facebook fares no better in garnering scathing critique of its influence on the political conversation. At its core, it's a platform meant to connect users with people they already like, not to foster discussion with those you might disagree with. Facebook's News Feed, which is how most users see content through the app and site, is more likely to prominently display content based on a user's previous interests, and it also conforms to his or her political ideology. A Wall Street Journal interactive from May of this year shows just how much your feed is affected by your political leanings. The company also faced rebuke from conservatives when it tried to share trending news stories on users' homepages; they said the shared articles reflected a liberal bias. And after trying unsuccessfully to begin filtering out fake news stories from users' feeds, Facebook has been increasingly accused of becoming a hotbed of fake political news. The most recent allegation comes from a BuzzFeed report, which found that a good amount of fake \u2014 and trending \u2014 Donald Trump news is coming from business-savvy millennials. In Macedonia. In response to these critiques, Facebook pointed NPR to a September post from the company's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, in which he said, \"Whatever TV station you might watch or whatever newspaper you might read, on Facebook you're hearing from a broader set of people than you would have otherwise.\" In that same post, Zuckerberg also pointed out studies showing that increasingly, more young people are getting their news primarily from sites like Facebook, and that young people have also said it helps them see a \"larger and more diverse set of opinions.\" And Zuckerberg said the company is trying to do a better job of sifting out fake news. Late last month, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg said Facebook had helped more than 2 million people register to vote. It's not just the social networks Social networks are built the way they're built, but how we've used them this year says just as much about our shortcomings as about any particular network's flaws. Data tracking trending topics and themes on social networks over the course of the campaign show that for the most part, America was less concerned with policy than with everything else. Talkwalker, a social media analytics company, found that the top three political themes across social media platforms during the past year were Trump's comments about women, Clinton's ongoing email scandal, and Trump's refusal to release his tax returns. \"Social media may have played a role in creating a kind of scandal-driven, as opposed to issue-driven, campaign,\" said Todd Grossman, CEO of Talkwalker Americas, \"where topics such as Trump's attitude towards women, Trump's tax returns and Clinton's emails have tended to dominate discussion as opposed to actual policy issues.\" And Brandwatch, another company that tracks social media trends, found that on Twitter, from the time Trump and Clinton formally began their campaigns for president, aside from conversation around the three presidential debates, only two policy-driven conversations were in their top 10 most-tweeted days. Those were Trump calling for a complete ban on Muslims entering the United States, and Trump visiting Mexico and delivering a fiery immigration speech in Arizona in the span of 24 hours. Brandwatch found that none of Clinton's 10 biggest days on Twitter centered on policy, save for the debates. (And even in that debate conversation, topics like \"nasty woman\" and \"bad hombres\" outpaced others.) Looking to the future So we end this campaign season with social media platforms seemingly hardwired for political argument, obfuscation and division. We are a public more concerned with scandal than policy, at least according to the social media data. And our candidates for higher office, led by Trump, seem more inclined to adopt the combative nature of social media than ever before. It's too late to fix these problems for this election, but a look to the social networks of tomorrow might offer some hope. Snapchat has emerged as the social network of the future. Data from Public Opinion Strategies find that more than 60 percent of U.S. smartphone owners ages 18 to 34 are using Snapchat and that on any given day, Snapchat reaches 41 percent of all 18- to 34-year-olds in the U.S. Any hope for the social media discourse of the future may be found with them. Peter Hamby, head of news at Snapchat, says the platform is a \"fundamentally different\" experience than other social media platforms, in part because, he says, on Snapchat, privacy is key. \"I think that people want to have a place where they can communicate with their friends and have fun, but also feel safe,\" Hamby said. He also said he is working on figuring out what young people want in a social network and how to make it better. And, he said, social media users increasingly want to rely on their social networks to make sense of the flood of political opinions, reporting and vitriol they're being bombarded with. \"One thing that me and my team have tried to do,\" Hamby told NPR, \"is explain the election. ... Because a lot of stuff you see on the Web, and TV, is pretty noisy.\" In asking whether social media ruined this election or not, I had to ask myself how my actions on social media have helped or hurt the country's political dialogue \u2014 what my contribution to all that noise has been. I'd have to say that even when I've tried to help, I'm not sure I've done enough. Last month, I shared an article about something political on Twitter. Two women got into an argument in the replies to my tweet. I could tell that they didn't know each other, and that they were supporting different candidates for president. Every tweet they hurled back and forth at each other mentioned me, so I got notifications during every step of their online fight. At one point, they began to call each other names, with one young woman calling the other the \"C\" word. I stepped in, told the two that they maybe should take a break from Twitter for a bit, do something else (or at least remove me from their mentions). Both responded. They apologized to each other and to me, and they both promised to log off for a bit. One mentioned trying to play a role in creating a nicer world after the election. I left it at that, but should I have done more? Should I have urged the two to message each other privately, try to talk politics civilly, maybe think about ways to have enriching, productive conversations online (or better yet, in person)? Should I have asked myself if the words I used in sharing the original article helped lead to the argument? Should the three of us have made it a teachable moment? Instead, they retreated from their battle positions for a few hours at best, never getting to know the stranger they insulted. And I moved on, and just kept tweeting. But I had to, right? Making the social Web nicer always takes a back seat to just trying to keep up. There were more tweets to see, more stuff to read, more Internet Post-it notes to throw along our social media floor. If social media ruined 2016, it's because of that: We haven't stopped long enough to try to sort it all out.",

            "article_content": "Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump says if he's elected president he will bring back some of the millions of manufacturing jobs that the United States has lost in recent decades. Democrat Hillary Clinton has a manufacturing plan as well, one she says will help create the manufacturing jobs of the future.  AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: Donald Trump has said if he's elected president, he'll bring back some of the millions of manufacturing jobs the U.S. has lost in recent decades. Hillary Clinton says she has a plan that will help create the manufacturing jobs of the future. NPR's Jim Zarroli takes a closer look at what Clinton is proposing and what it might accomplish. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: Like Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton sees a vibrant manufacturing sector as essential to the economy. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) HILLARY CLINTON: We are builders, and we need to get back to building. ZARROLI: But while Trump promises to bring back lost jobs, Clinton envisions a new model of manufacturing called Make It In America Partnerships. They're aimed at creating jobs in cutting-edge fields such as biotechnology and aeronautics. Thomas Kochan of MIT is a sometime adviser to the Clinton campaign. THOMAS KOCHAN: It's not nostalgic in the sense that we're going to bring back a lot of the jobs that were shipped overseas, but it's focused on the next generation of manufacturing opportunities. ZARROLI: Clinton's plan would work this way - companies, banks, universities and local governments would form partnerships that take advantage of local resources. If a college has a great robotics program, for example, and its graduates have lots of ideas for new businesses, local officials might help them find financing. High school students would learn the kinds of skills these businesses need. And if these businesses need plants or transportation facilities, federal money may be used to build them. Kochan says these partnerships can take years to develop. KOCHAN: People will have to be recognizing that it will take a long time to turn this economy around and get jobs and wages and manufacturing all moving in the right direction. ZARROLI: But the hope is these hubs can eventually lead to the kind of well-paying manufacturing jobs that are common in Germany and Japan. Clinton also hopes these partnerships will create the kind of ecosystem that will encourage manufacturers to stay in a region. But if they leave, the government could claw back any tax benefits they've received. Economist Peter Navarro of the University of California, Irvine who advises Trump says this strategy is mistaken. PETER NAVARRO: Clinton's approach is kind of the schoolmarm approach where we're going to wrap their knuckles if they do it. What Donald Trump recognizes is that you have to basically realign corporate incentives so that they'll produce here rather than offshore. ZARROLI: Navarro says if the government wants to encourage manufacturing, it should cut corporate taxes and eliminate regulations. Chad Bown of the Peterson Institute for International Economics says Trump's ideas differ from Clinton's in another way. Trump would address unfair trading practices by countries such as China by threatening to tear up existing trade pacts. Clinton is more likely to use existing mechanisms such as the World Trade Organization to settle disputes. CHAD BOWN: I think where that's fundamentally different is the recognition that there are international rules that we can take advantage of, you know, in the form of the existing trade agreements that we're a party to, so, for example, the WTO. ZARROLI: Many of Clinton's proposals, including the Make It In America Partnerships, are a lot like ideas put forward by the Obama administration. But while President Obama's ambitions were hobbled by the Great Recession, Clinton believes she has the opportunity to take the agenda much further. Still, Clinton faces the same reality as Trump. Manufacturers today are so much more productive. They don't need as many workers as they used to. Jim Zarroli, NPR News, New York. Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Editor's note: NPR fact-checked Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump's economic speech on Monday. Trump delivered an address Monday to the Detroit Economic Club, outlining a plan to cut taxes and get rid of regulations. Today was Hillary Clinton's turn, where she argued that her plan would boost the middle class while Trump's plan \"would give trillions in tax cuts to big corporations, millionaires, and Wall Street money managers.\" Clinton spoke at Futuramic Tool & Engineering, an advanced manufacturing facility in Warren, Mich. Clinton has been talking about her jobs plan for weeks now, visiting factories and small business. Her address was meant as a contrast to Trump's dark vision of the state of American manufacturing and focus on coal and steel, industries that have been in steep decline for more than a generation. As she's talked about the economy, Clinton has faced a couple of challenges; convincing white working class voters that she feels their pain and condensing her five point economic plan into something simple, catchy and satisfying. She spent much of the speech drawing out contrasts with Trump, portraying them as unrealistic and destructive, while describing her own proposals. Clinton also debuted a new attack on Trump's tax plan saying it includes a \"Trump Loophole\" designed to benefit his businesses and cut his own personal tax burden. Trump's actual personal tax burden is unknown because he has broken with the long-standing tradition of presidential candidates and hasn't yet released his tax returns for public review. A source close to Clinton says she will be releasing her 2015 tax returns in the coming days (all of her tax returns dating back to the 1970s have been released to the public) and her running mate Tim Kaine will be releasing ten years of his family's tax returns as well. This is intended to put additional pressure on Trump, who has said he won't release his taxes while they are under audit, something he claims is ongoing. Thank you. Thank you so much. I have to tell you, I am thrilled to be here for a number of reasons. First, it's wonderful to be back in Michigan. You can really feel the energy and dynamism that is driving this state's comeback. [The unemployment rate in Michigan peaked in June 2009 at a stunning 14.9 percent and has been falling essentially ever since. Unemployment in the state as of June 2016 was 4.6 percent, though that is a preliminary reading. -Tamara Keith] And, in Detroit, we've got new businesses opening, neighborhoods like Midtown and Eastern Market are coming back, the auto industry just had its best year ever. [By the measure of new cars purchased, 2015, was in fact a banner year. Take this headline from Car And Driver: Boom! \"We Look Back at 2015 U.S. Auto Sales, the Best Year Ever.\" The article credits the improved economy. -Tamara Keith] Over in Ann Arbor, high tech firms are thriving, the next generation of engineers are getting trained up in Houghton and here at Futuramic, so well named, you are on the front lines of what I believe will be a true manufacturing renaissance in America. I just was given a short but exciting tour by Mark Jurcak and John Couch, who were telling me about how this company, what started as and for most of its early history, was an auto supply company. And then in 2000 as the market began to change and some of the auto companies began to realign, they were faced with a choice. We all face choices in life, don't we? And this company could have just said hey, you know, our business is not going to be what it was. We've got to just fold up. Let's, you know, just kind of quit. But that's not what happened here. And what happened here is what can happen across America. You are in now what is largely an aerospace company, and because of the workforce and the work ethic and the commitment of Futuramic, you are seeing the future unfold. So, I got to see what's happening here to help build the SLS rocket, that is going to go from Macomb to Mars. I saw the two halves of an F35 nose cone waiting to be put together. I talked with some of the workers about the absolute perfection that is required to do this work. And what I believe with all my heart is that what's happening here, can happen in so many places if we put our minds to it, if we support advanced manufacturing, if we are the kind of country that once again understands how important it is to build things. We are builders and we need to get back to building. [This is a key part of Clinton's economic message. She talks regularly about advanced manufacturing, visiting factories around the country to promote the idea that although American manufacturing won't return to what it once was, it could be something new, more efficient and innovative. This is quite a contrast with Trump's pledge to reopen steel mills that were shuttered a generation ago and bring the coal industry back to what it once was. -Tamara Keith] So we're making progress. None of us can be satisfied until the economic revitalization we're seeing in some parts of Michigan reaches every community but it is inspiring to see this combination of old fashioned hard work and cutting edge innovation. And I know my opponent in this election was here in Michigan about a week ago and it was like he was in a different place. When he visited Detroit on Monday, he talked only of failure, poverty and crime. He is missing so much about what makes Michigan great. And the same is true when it comes to our country. He describes America as an embarrassment. He said and I quote, 'We're becoming a third world country.' Look around you my friends. Go visit with the workers building rockets. That doesn't happen in third world countries! [Nigeria, India, Iran, Ukraine, and Algeria are developing nations with space programs. \u2014 Jonquilyn Hill] Now we have a lot of urgent and important work to do and that's what I'm going to talk about today. Because all of the people that I have met throughout this campaign, really prove how wrong this negative, pessimistic view is. America's best days are still ahead of us if we make up our minds to actually go out and make that happen. Just consider our assets. We have the most dynamic, productive workforce in the world, bar none. We have the most innovative businesses, the top colleges, universities, community colleges, training programs in the world. And the best science and technology. We have enormous capacity for clean energy production. We are resilient, determined, hardworking - there is nothing America can't do if we do it together. And I know this because this is how I was raised. And I don't think Mr. Trump understands any of it. He hasn't offered any credible solutions for the very real economic challenges we face. Now, those challenges emerged long before the great recession, and they have persisted through our recovery. There's too much inequality, too little upward mobility. It is just too hard to get ahead today. But there are common sense things that your government could do that would give Americans more opportunities to succeed. Why don't we do it? Because powerful special interests and the tendency to put ideology ahead of political progress have led to gridlock in Congress. And how can you not be frustrated, and even angry, when you see nothing getting done? And a lot of people feel no one is on their side and no one has their back. And that is not how it's supposed to be in America. If I am fortunate enough to be your President, I will have your back every single day that I serve. And my mission in the White House will be to make our economy work for everyone, not just those at the top. This is personal for me. I am a product of the American middle class. I was born in Chicago. I was raised in a suburb. But my grandfather worked at the Scranton lace mill in Scranton, Pennsylvania, for fifty years. And because he worked hard, my dad was able to go to college, and eventually start his own small business \u2013 and send me off into the world to follow my dreams. No matter how far those dreams have taken me, I've always remembered that I'm the daughter of a small-business owner and the granddaughter of a factory worker \u2014 and proud of both. So here's what I want. I want every American family to be able to tell the same story. If you work hard. You do your part, you should be able to give your children all the opportunities they deserve. That is the basic bargain of America. Now, whether we will be able to renew that bargain on even better terms for the 21st century depends, in large measure, on the outcome of this election. So here are four questions that I hope the American people will ask of both candidates \u2014 and that the answers should help make your choice in November crystal clear: First, which candidate has a real plan to create good-paying jobs? Second, who will restore fairness to our economy and ensure that those at the top pay their fair share of taxes? Third, who will really go to bat for working families? And, fourth, who can bring people together to deliver results that will make a difference in your lives? Now, I hope that after giving a fair hearing to both sides, you will join the millions of people across our country supporting this campaign \u2013 not just Democrats, but a growing number of Republicans and Independents as well. [This week Clinton's campaign launched an initiative called Together For America, designed to reach out to Republicans and Independents who could be persuaded to vote for her. But it's unlikely she will be swaying them on policy. She hasn't moderated her positions at all since the primary. Instead she and her campaign seem to be making a pitch based largely on temperament and values, not on taxes, college affordability or health care policy. One Republican I interviewed who is supporting Clinton over Trump said \"You have to have a hierarchy of principles at a time like this.\" And in 2016, tax policy has moved down on his priorities list. -Tamara Keith] Now, when it comes to creating jobs, I would argue it's not even close. Even conservative experts say Trump's agenda will pull our economy back into recession. And according to an independent analysis by a former economic adviser to Senator John McCain, [Clinton is referring to Mark Zandi here, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. She has brought up the Zandi connection on multiple occasions. Zandi was listed among McCain's advisors on his 2008 campaign, but Zandi also advised the Obama administration on its stimulus package, as the Wall Street Journal reported this year. A search on OpenSecrets.org finds that he contributed to John McCain, but also to several Democrats over the years \u2014 including Hillary Clinton last year. All of which is to say that while solely linking him to McCain might imply that he's a conservative economist, that would be misleading. \u2014 Danielle Kurtzleben] if you add up all of Trump's ideas \u2013 from cutting taxes for the wealthy and corporations to starting a trade war with China to deporting millions of hard-working immigrants \u2014 the result would be a loss of 3.4 million jobs. [This Moody's report tried to project the effects of a bundle of Trump's policies together. They projected that employment would grow at first, but then jobs would disappear. Ultimately, they wrote, the U.S. would lose 3.4 million jobs during a Trump presidency under his policies, compared to a 6 million gain under current law. That said, a forecast like this offers \"false precision,\" as the Upshot's Neil Irwin pointed out, as it is necessarily uncertain \u2014 the assumptions beneath the report, he wrote, \"involve some guesswork and are at least debatable.\" \u2014 Danielle Kurtzleben] By contrast, the same analyst found that with our plans, the economy would create more than 10 million new jobs. [This Moody's report tried to project the effects of a bundle of Trump's policies together. They projected that employment would grow at first, but then jobs would disappear. Ultimately, they wrote, the U.S. would lose 3.4 million jobs during a Trump presidency under his policies, compared to a 6 million gain under current law. That said, a forecast like this offers \"false precision,\" as the Upshot's Neil Irwin pointed out, as it is necessarily uncertain \u2014 the assumptions beneath the report, he wrote, \"involve some guesswork and are at least debatable.\" (Meaning the same would be true of the assumptions underlying the report on Clinton's policies \u2014 see below.) \u2014 Danielle Kurtzleben] So let me tell you how we would do it. I believe every American willing to work hard should be able to find a job that provides dignity, pride, and decent pay that can support a family. So starting on Day One, we will work with both parties to pass the biggest investment in new, good-paying jobs since World War II. We will put Americans to work building and modernizing our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our railways, our ports, our airports. We are way overdue for this, my friends. [Spending on infrastructure is one area where Clinton and Trump agree. She has proposed spending $275 billion over five years on infrastructure. Trump, meanwhile, has said he would double Clinton's spending on infrastructure \u2014 that's a big change from the usual Republican economic thinking, as the Wall Street Journal's Michelle Hackman wrote, as it could mean a significantly bigger deficit. \u2014 Danielle Kurtzleben] We are living off the investments that were made by our parents and grandparents' generations. We will also help cities like Detroit and Flint connect underserved neighborhoods to opportunity, expanding affordable housing, and repair schools and failing water systems as well. You know, I happen to think we should be ambitious. While we're at it, let's connect every household to broadband by the year 2020. It's astonishing to me how many places in America not way way far away from cities but in cities and near cities that don't have access to broadband. And that disadvantages kids who are asked to do homework using the Internet; 5 million of them live in homes without access to the Internet. So you talk about an achievement gap, it starts right there. And let's build a cleaner, more resilient power grid with enough renewable energy to power every home in our country as well. Some country is going to be the clean energy superpower of the 21st century and create millions of jobs and businesses. It's probably going to be either China, Germany, or America. I want it to be us! We invent the technology, we should make it and use it and export it, which will help to grow our economy. [Bringing jobs back from overseas is a major theme of Trump's campaign that has resonated with many voters around the country. On the issue of energy, Trump primarily focuses on reviving older energy sources like coal and promoting fracking, though he has talked about advocating \"clean coal\" technology.An analysis by Scientific American found that Trump's promise to bring back closed coal mines would be difficult to fulfill, both because of environmental regulations and economic shifts -Sarah McCammon] And here's something you don't always hear enough from Democrats: a big part of our plan will be unleashing the power of the private sector to create more jobs at higher pay. And that means for us, creating an infrastructure bank to get private funds off the sidelines and complement our public investments. $25 billion in government seed funding could unlock more than $250 billion and really get our country moving on our infrastructure plans. And we're going to invest $10 billion in \"Make it in America\" partnerships to support American manufacturing and recommit to scientific research that can create entire new industries. When Mark and John were giving me the tour and I was talking to some of the workers along the way and asking them where some of the precision machinery came from that is being used here at Futuramic, what I hear all over the country - Germany, Japan, Italy - I want to bring that precision manufacturing back to the United States. There is no reason we can't begin to make those machines ourselves and supply the rest of the world instead of buying from somewhere else. Let's also expand incentives like the New Market Tax Credits that can bring businesses, government, and communities together to create good jobs in places that have been left out and left behind. From neglected neighborhoods in Detroit and Flint to Logging Country, Coal Country, and Native American communities. From rural areas ravaged by addiction and lost jobs to industrial regions hollowed out when factories closed. As president, I will also make a major push to empower small businesses and entrepreneurs. With new national initiatives to cut red tape at every level and expand access to credit, especially through community banks and credit unions. I will propose a new plan to dramatically simplify tax filing for small businesses. Right now, the smallest businesses, the kind that my dad had, cause it was a really small business, spend 20 times more per employee to prepare their taxes compared to their larger companies. It should be as easy as printing out a bank statement. [This stat comes from 2015 congressional testimony from Tax Analysts Chief Economist Martin A. Sullivan, who found that firms that employ 1 to 5 people spend $1,101 per employee on federal tax compliance, compared to $51 per employee at businesses that have 50 or more employees. In \"Her Way,\" authors Jeff Gerth and Don Van Natta write about Hugh Rodham's small business, saying that only \"when his two sons were old enough to pitch in on the occasional Saturday, did he get help. \u2014 Danielle Kurtzleben] Let's free entrepreneurs to do what they do best \u2013 innovate, grow, and hire. As Mark said, this company started because of a drive down a road, and thinking about it, talking about it, then seeing one of the old Oldsmobile futuramics and deciding, hey not only do I have an idea, I have a name. In America, if you can dream it, you should be able to build it. And we're going to get back to doing that. Now, Donald Trump has a different view.  He's made a career of stiffing small businesses from Atlantic City to Las Vegas. There are companies that were left hanging because he refused to pay their bills. A lot of those companies scraped together what they could to pay their employees and many of them put their businesses at risk and some of them ended up taking bankruptcy. It wasn't because Trump couldn't pay them, it was because he wouldn't pay them. [A USA Today investigation found hundreds of people who accuse Trump of failing to pay them for their work. According to USA Today, Trump has put the blame on contractors he hired as go-betweens, and has said that the events described happened long ago. The Wall Street Journal has done similar reporting. - Sarah McCammon] And that's why I take it personally. My dad ran a printing plant. He had two really long tables. He printed fabric for draperies. He would lay out the fabric and then he would take a silkscreen and he would go down the table, he'd put the silkscreen down, he'd pour the paint in, he'd take the squeegee, he'd go across the screen, he'd lift it up, he'd go down all the way to the end and then he'd start on the other table. He worked hard. And then when he finished, he would load all that fabric up, put it in his car, and take it to the business that had ordered it - maybe a restaurant, or a hotel or some office. He expected to be paid when he showed up. He did the work. He paid for the supplies and the labor that he often hired to help him on big jobs. He expected to be paid. I can't imagine what would have happened to my father and his business if he had gotten a contract from Trump. And showing up and submitting his bill had been told we're not going to pay and if you don't like it, sue us. My father never could have sued a big organization like that. I just don't understand it. I've met all kinds of workers, painters, plumbers. I've met small businesses that provided pianos, installed glass or marble, all of whom were denied payment and after going back time and again being told, well maybe we'll pay thirty cents on the dollar or fifty cents on the dollar. That's not how we do business in America. So we've got to create more good jobs that are going to help more people. For example, our modern service economy is empowering consumers with more choices and greater flexibility. But we need to do more to empower the workers in our service sector too. The people taking care of our children and our parents they deserve a good wage, good benefits, and a secure retirement. And, it's crucial that every American have access to the education and skills they need to get the jobs of the future. So we will fight to make college tuition-free for the middle class and debt-free for everyone. [This is a relatively new position for Clinton. For much of the primary, Clinton's plan was for \"debt free college.\" Then after the voting was done as part of negotiations with the Bernie Sanders campaign, Clinton agreed to expand her proposal to make public universities tuition free for middle class and low income students. -Tamara Keith] We will also liberate millions of people who already have student debt by making it easier to refinance and repay what you owe as a portion of your income so you never have to pay more than you can afford. It's not right that Donald Trump can ignore his debts, but students and families can't refinance theirs. And here's something neither party talks about enough: a four-year degree shouldn't be the only path to a good job. You should be able to learn a skill, practice a trade, and make a good living doing it. So many Americans have the talent and the will to succeed \u2014 whether they're kids right out of high school or older people displaced by automation and outsourcing. For too long, big promises about the power of training and retraining haven't delivered like they should. It doesn't help anyone to be trained for a job that doesn't exist. So we'll support high-quality union training programs, propose new tax credits to encourage more companies to offer paid apprenticeships that let you earn while you learn, and do more to dignify skills training across the board \u2013 for welders, machinists, health technicians, and so many other fields. I'm sure some of you are thinking, that all sounds good. But what about trade? After all, Trump talks about it all the time. Well, let's start with this: It's true that too often,past trade deals have been sold to the American people with rosy scenarios that didn't pan out. Those promises now ring hollow in many communities across Michigan and our country that have seen factories close and jobs disappear. Too many companies lobbied for trade deals so they could sell products abroad but instead moved abroad and sold back into the United States. It's also true that China and other countries have gamed the system for too long. Enforcement \u2014 especially during the Bush administration \u2014 has been too lax. Investments at home that would make us more competitive have been blocked. And American workers and communities have paid the price. But the answer is not to rant and rave \u2013 or to cut ourselves off from the world. That would kill even more jobs. The answer is to finally make trade work for us, not against us. So my message to every worker in Michigan and across America is this: I will stop any trade deal that kills jobs or holds down wages \u2013 including the Trans-Pacific Partnership. I oppose it now, I'll oppose it after the election, and I'll oppose it as president. [This is Clinton's strongest language yet about the trade deal she called a \"gold standard\" when she was secretary of state in the Obama administration. At the time, the trade pact was in the early stages of negotiations. For the first several months of her campaign, Clinton resisted taking a position on TPP, saying the deal was still being negotiated. She finally weighed in last October, a week before the first Democratic debate, saying she couldn't support it in its current form. Many progressives are suspicious that, like President Obama did, she would soften her opposition to the trade deal if she is elected. Donald Trump has also charged that Clinton fully intends to sign off on TPP if she is president. Clinton has held firm in her opposition, but in an interview a close political ally of hers seemed to confirm the suspicions, saying she would likely implement it as president. The campaign moved immediately to tamp that down and Clinton in this speech was unequivocal \u2014 perhaps because she had to be. -Tamara Keith] As a Senator, I fought to defend New York's manufacturers and steel-makers from unfair Chinese trading practices. And I opposed the only multilateral trade deal that came before the Senate while I was there, because it didn't meet my high bar. [Clinton voted against the multilateral Trade Act of 2002. However, she did vote in favor of six bilateral trade agreements during her her tenure as a U.S. Senator. \u2014 Jonquilyn Hill] As Secretary of State, I fought hard for American businesses to get a fair shot around the world and to stop underhanded trading practices like currency manipulation and theft of intellectual property. As President, I'll stand up to China and anyone else who tries to take advantage of American workers and companies. I'm going to ramp up enforcement by appointing a new chief trade prosecutor, tripling the number of enforcement officers, and when countries break the rules, we won't hesitate to impose targeted tariffs. And Trump? He may talk a big game on trade, but his approach is based on fear, not strength. Fear that we can't compete with the rest of the world even when the rules are fair. Fear that our country has no choice but to hide behind walls. If Team USA was as fearful as Trump, Michael Phelps and Simone Biles [sim-OWN BYE-ells] would be cowering in the locker room. Instead, they're winning gold medals. Because America isn't afraid to compete. Right now, thousands of Michigan companies are exporting billions of dollars of products around the world. We want them to sell even more \u2013 and create more jobs here at home. But corporations shouldn't abandon profitable operations here to move abroad, just to give shareholders a quicker return, CEOs a bigger bonus, and unions a weaker hand to play. Now, before he tweets about how he's really one who'll put \"America First\" in trade, let's remember where Trump makes many of his own products. Because it's sure not America. He's made Trump ties in China and Trump suits in Mexico instead of here in Michigan. [Trump says he manufactures products outside the United States because he's a businessman and that's the best way to compete in the current marketplace. What's unclear, as conservative and liberal observers have pointed out, is what policies Trump would propose to change the current market dynamics to encourage textile production in the U.S. -Sarah McCammon] He keeps saying it's not possible to make these things in America anymore. That's just wrong. We created a website \u2014 hillaryclinton.com/make-it-here \u2014 with a list of a hundred places across the United States already producing similar goods. One positive thing Trump could do to make America great again is to actually make great things in America again. Now, let's look at the second question: which candidate will fight for fairness? This is an urgent need. The tide isn't rising fast enough, and it's certainly not lifting all boats. Since the crash, too many of the gains have gone to the top 1 percent. The rules and incentives of our economy reward corporations for putting short-term stock prices above long-term investments in workers, equipment, and research. While corporate profits are at near-record highs, paychecks for most people have barely budged. Incomes aren't growing fast enough to keep up with costs like prescription drugs and child care. I believe that every employee, from the CEO suite to the factory floor, contributes to a business' success, so everybody should share in the rewards \u2013 especially those putting in long hours for little pay. So I'm proposing a new tax credit to encourage more companies to share profits with workers. More broadly, we will fight for a more progressive, more patriotic tax code that puts American jobs first. Right now, when a corporation outsources jobs and production, it can write off the costs. We should stop that, and instead make them give back tax breaks they received here at home. For those that move their headquarters overseas to avoid paying their fair share of taxes, they should pay a new exit tax. And Wall Street, corporations, and the super-rich should finally pay their fair share of taxes. I support the Buffett Rule, because multi-millionaires should not be able to pay a lower tax rate than their secretaries. We should also add a new tax on multi-millionaires... crack down on tax gaming by corporations... and close the carried interest loophole \u2013 something I've been calling for years. What does Trump say? There's a myth out there that he'll stick it to the rich and powerful because, at heart, he's really on the side of the little guy. Don't believe it. Not when he pledges to rip up basic rules that hold corporations accountable...when he wants to scrap regulations that stop polluters from poisoning the air our children breathe and the water we drink... and let insurance companies write their own rules again. Trump would roll back tough rules on the financial industry. I'll do the opposite \u2013 we should strengthen those rules so that Wall Street can never wreck Main Street again! Trump even wants to abolish the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which has already returned more than $11 billion to 25 million Americans. Why would you get rid of that? Then there's Trump's tax plan. He would give trillions in tax cuts to big corporations, millionaires, and Wall Street money managers. That would explode our national debt and lead to massive cuts in priorities like education, healthcare, and environmental protection. In his speech on Monday, he called for a new tax loophole \u2013 let's call it the \"Trump Loophole.\" It would allow him to pay less than half the current tax rate on income from many of his companies. He'd pay a lower rate than millions of middle class families. One nonpartisan expert at the Tax Policy Center described this plan as, quote, \"a really nice deal\"... for Donald Trump. Of course, it's hard to say how nice, because he refuses to do what every other Presidential candidate in decades has done and release his tax returns. But we do know that the 400 richest taxpayers in America would get an average tax cut of more than $15 million a year from this loophole. Then there's the Estate Tax, which Trump wants to eliminate altogether. If you believe that he's as wealthy as he says, that alone would save the Trump family $4 billion. But it would do nothing for 99.8 percent of Americans. Let me repeat that: the Trump family gets a $4 billion tax cut... and 99.8 percent of Americans get nothing. Just think about what we could do with those $4 billion dollars. We could pay for more than 47,000 veterans to get a 4-year college degree. [That's about right, so long as not every veteran chooses to go to a public school outside their state. In the 2015-2016 school year, the cost of in-state tuition and fees for one year at 4-year public colleges - the GI Bill won't pay for private colleges - was just over $9,000. Multiply that by four years and you get $36,000. Multiply that by 47,000 and you get about $1.7 billion - well under Clinton's estimate. But out-of-state tuition was just under $24,000 per year. Do the same math and you'll end up at $4.5 billion, slightly over Clinton's estimate. - Meg Anderson] We could provide a year's worth of health care to nearly 3 million kids. [The Children's Health Insurance Program insures more than 8 million children annually and costs more than $13 billion. Insuring 3 million more kids represents an increase of about 37 percent. When you factor that increase into the cost, you'll see an increase slightly under $5 billion \u2014 which is probably what makes the word \"nearly\" important in this claim. - Meg Anderson] Or fund about a year's worth of federal assistance to state and local law enforcement. That's a better way to spend the money. On Monday, I'm going to be in Scranton, Pennsylvania, with Vice President Biden. He has a saying: \"Don't tell me what you value. Show me your budget and I will tell you what you value.\" Well, Donald Trump wants to give trillions in tax breaks to people like himself. I want to invest in our veterans, our kids, and our police officers. You can judge for yourself about our values. Now, it's true that both of us have proposed to cut taxes for middle class families. As usual, he's making big promises. But, his advisors have said that he may not stand by them.Instead, the tax cuts he doubled down on in his speech on Monday offer trillions to the richest Americans and corporations. One of the differences between Donald Trump and me is that I'll stand by my plans. So this is another case of the old saying that \"if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.\" This brings us to the third question: Which candidate can you actually count on to go to bat for workers and working families? It's not enough to pay lip service to being on your side. We have to recognize how Americans actually live and work in the 21st century \u2013 and then offer real solutions that make your lives easier. We know that women are now the sole or primary breadwinner in a growing number of families. And more Americans are cobbling together part time work, or striking out on their own. So we have to make it easier to be good workers, good parents, and good caregivers, all at the same time. That's why I've set out a bold vision to make quality, affordable childcare available to all Americans and limit costs to 10 percent of family income. On Monday, Trump offered his first real ideas on this topic. Previously, he dismissed concerns about childcare. He said it was, quote, \"not an expensive thing\" because you just need some blocks and you need some swings. Now he says he wants to exclude childcare payments from taxation. But his plan was panned left, right, and center \u2013 because it's transparently designed for rich people. He would give wealthy families 30 or 40 cents on the dollar for their nannies, and little or nothing for millions of hard-working families trying to afford childcare so they can get to work and keep the job. [Trump's proposed income tax deduction on the average cost of childcare was criticized for likely being more of a help to higher-income families than to many working-class families. However, the Trump campaign has also said that it will allow lower-income families to deduct the cost of childcare from their payroll taxes. The campaign says it will offer more details in coming weeks on their childcare plans. \u2014 Danielle Kurtzleben] We can do better. We should expand the Child Tax Credit to provide real relief to tens of millions of working families struggling with the costs of raising children \u2013 the same families Donald Trump's plan largely ignores. This is just a start. Because the more we do to help working families, the more our entire economy will benefit. For example, guaranteeing equal pay won't just increase paychecks for women \u2013 it will boost family budgets and get incomes rising across the board. Yet for some reason, Trump's against it. Paid family leave won't only make life easier for moms and dads \u2014 it will also keep skilled, talented Americans in the workforce and grow our economy. That's why every other advanced economy already offers it. But again, Trump's against it. [There are no federal legal requirements for paid family leave in the U.S., and among OECD countries, the United States is the only country that doesn't offer paid maternity leave. Some states have their own paid leave laws and most U.S. workers are covered by the Family Medical Leave Act, which allows for up to 12 weeks of leave annually, albeit unpaid. - Meg Anderson] Raising the federal minimum wage won't just put more money in the pocket of low-income families \u2013 it also means they spend more money at the businesses in their neighborhoods. Trump's against that as well. Expanding Social Security won't just help older Americans retire with dignity \u2013 it will ease burdens on families and communities. Passing comprehensive immigration reform won't just help keep hard-working families together \u2013 it will grow our entire economy. And finally, strengthening unions doesn't just serve members \u2013 it leads to better pay, and benefits, and working conditions for all employees. [A large body of academic research suggests that labor unions do raise the overall level of wages and benefits in the economy. An influential 2011 research paper found that declines in union membership since 1973 accounted for a third of the increase in wage inequality for male workers and a fifth of the increase in wage inequality for female workers. -Brett Neely] And giving Americans in every state the choice of a public-option health insurance plan won't just help those who struggle to afford coverage \u2013 it will strengthen competition and drive down costs for everyone. These are all causes I've worked on for decades. I believe they point to a fundamental truth about our economy. It may seem zero-sum when you're competing for a job, a promotion, or a contract \u2013 someone wins and someone loses. But that's not the full picture. If you step back, you'll see that we really are all in this together. If we grow together, we can all rise together. Because we're stronger together. And that's why the fourth question is key: Who can bring people together to get any of this done? What we need is serious, steady leadership that can find common ground and build on it based on hard but respectful bargaining. Leadership that rises above personal attacks and name calling, not revels in it. Donald Trump insults, shouts down, and bullies his opponents. He can't even play nice with his friends. I know it's hard to imagine, but there was a time when Democrats and Republicans actually worked together. I know because I did it as First Lady, Senator, and Secretary of State. It's how we created the Children's Health Insurance Program, which covers 8 million kids, rebuilt New York after 9/11, and passed a treaty reducing the threat from Russia's nuclear weapons. So I am convinced we can work together again. One of the reasons I asked Tim Kaine to be my running mate is that he has a record of working across the aisle to get things done, as a mayor, governor, and now Senator. Together, we'll make full use of the White House's power to convene. We'll get everyone at the table \u2013 not just Republicans and Democrats, but business and labor leaders... academics and experts... and, most importantly, all of you. I want working people to have a real say in your government again. That means we have to get unaccountable money out of our politics, overturn Citizens United, and expand voting rights, not restrict them. Starting even before the election, we will bring together leaders from across our economy and our communities for meetings on jobs,American competitiveness, and working families. We all need to pull together and give our country the best chance to succeed. The bottom line is this: I'm running for president to build an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top. Donald Trump wants America to work for him and his friends, at the expense of everyone else. He's offered no credible plans to address what working families are up against today. Nothing on student loans or the cost of prescription drugs. Nothing for farmers and struggling rural communities looking to build a new future with clean energy and advanced agriculture. Nothing for communities of color in our cities to overcome barriers of systemic racism and create new opportunities for young people. All he does offer is an even more extreme version of the failed theory of trickle-down economics, with the addition of his own unique Trumpian spin \u2013 outlandish ideas that even many Republicans reject. Trump may believe that he \"alone can fix\" our country. Clearly, he doesn't know the people of Michigan. He doesn't see businesses, labor unions, local government, clergy and community leaders coming together every single day to make things better. Yes, there is still a long road ahead, but Michigan is on the rise. And everyone is contributing. That's America at its best. I hope you'll stay active and engaged \u2013 working together to create jobs and build up your communities... working together to get out the vote and win in November... and working together after the election to press for the real progress we need. As your president, I'll be your partner every step of the way. Because our nation needs every one of us to lend our energy, talents, and ambition to making America better. \"Stronger Together\" is not just a slogan for our campaign. It's a guiding principle for the future we're going to build. And it's the choice we've got to make this November \u2014 whether our country will work for everyone, or just for those at the top. Whether it'll be a \"stronger together\" economy where we all rise together, or an \"us versus them\" economy where we all fight over a shrinking pie. I think the choice is clear. I believe with all my heart that the American Dream is alive and big enough for everyone to share in its promise. So I'm asking for your support to help make that happen. Thank you very much.",

Donald Trump laid out his plan for the economy, criticizing globalization and policies that promote free trade, in a speech in Monessen, Pa., on Tuesday. NPR's politics team has annotated Trump's speech. The portions we commented on are bolded, followed by analysis and fact check in italics. We will update further. The speech follows: Thank you everybody. I'd like to thank the owner of the plant. I'd like to thank Rick Santorum, our great senator. And I have to say all of the amazing workers. Gabe [Hudock] said they're the most important. The amazing workers. And I know you've been through some very, very tough times. But we're going to make it better and we're going to make it better fast. Just watch. It is great to be here. I'd like to thank Alumisource and all the amazing workers here for hosting us. So today, I am going to talk about how to make America wealthy again. Have to do it. We are 30 miles from Steel City. Pittsburgh played a central role in building our nation. The legacy of Pennsylvania steelworkers lives in the bridges, railways and skyscrapers that make up our great American landscape. But our workers' loyalty \u2014 you know it better than anybody \u2014 was repaid with total betrayal. Our politicians have aggressively pursued a policy of globalization \u2014 moving our jobs, our wealth and our factories to Mexico and overseas. [The Trump campaign provided a footnoted version of this speech on its website. Interestingly, this passage and others later in the speech cite research from the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank whose research has often been cited by Bernie Sanders, among others. \u2014 Danielle Kurtzleben] Globalization has made the financial elite who donate to politicians very, very, wealthy. I used to be one of them. Hate to say it, but I used to be one. But it has left millions of our workers with nothing but poverty and heartache. [Trump seems to be acknowledging one of the biggest criticisms leveled at his campaign. He runs on fiercely protectionist policies, but many of the goods produced under his name (as well as his daughter Ivanka's) have been produced in other countries, as Harvard's Robert Lawrence detailed in a March column at PBS. \u2014 Danielle Kurtzleben] When subsidized foreign steel is dumped into our markets, threatening our factories, the politicians have proven, folks, have proven, they do nothing. For years, they watched on the sidelines as our jobs vanished and our communities were plunged into Depression-level unemployment. Many of these areas have still never recovered. And never will unless I become president. Then they're going to recover fast. Our politicians took away from the people their means of making a living and supporting their families. Skilled craftsmen and tradespeople and factory workers have seen the jobs they loved shipped thousands and thousands of miles away. Many Pennsylvania towns once thriving and humming are now in a state [of] despair. This wave of globalization has wiped out totally, totally, our middle class. It doesn't have to be this way. We can turn it all around \u2014 and we can turn it around fast. But if we're going to deliver real change, we're going to have to reject the campaign of fear and intimidation being pursued by powerful corporations, media elites, and political dynasties. The people who rigged the system for their benefit will do anything \u2014 and say anything \u2014 to keep things exactly the way they are. The people who rigged the system are supporting Hillary Clinton because they know as long as she is in charge nothing is going to change. The inner cities will remain poor. The factories will remain closed. The borders will remain open. The special interests will remain firmly in control. Hillary Clinton and her friends in global finance want to scare America into thinking small \u2014 and they want to scare American people out of voting for a better future. And you have a great future, folks. You have a great future. These people have given her tens of billions of dollars. My campaign has the absolute opposite message. I want you to imagine a much better life and a life where you can believe in the American dream again. Right now you can't do that. I want you to imagine how much better our future can be if we declare independence from the elites who've led us to one financial and foreign policy disaster to another. Our friends in Britain recently voted to take back control of their economy, politics and borders. I was on the right side of that issue, as you know \u2014 with the people \u2014 I was there, I said it was going to happen, I felt it \u2014 while Hillary, as always, stood with the elites, and both she and President Obama predicted that one and many others, totally wrong. Now it's time for the American people to take back their future. They're going to take it back. That's the choice we face. We can either give in to Hillary Clinton's campaign of fear, or we can choose to believe again in America. Very sadly, we lost our way when we stopped believing in our country. America became the world's dominant economy by becoming the world's dominant producer. You know that from right here. Right in this plant. The wealth this created was shared broadly, creating the biggest middle class the world had ever known. But then America changed its policy from promoting development in America \u2014 in, in, in America \u2014 to promoting development in other nations. That's what's happening and that's what happened. We allowed foreign countries to subsidize their goods, devalue their currencies, violate their agreements, and cheat in every way imaginable. And our politicians did nothing about it. Trillions of our dollars and millions of our jobs flowed overseas as a result. I have visited cities and towns across this country where a third or even half of manufacturing jobs have been wiped out in the last 20 years. [Promoting the growth of manufacturing is an economic policy that embodies Trump's Make America Great Again slogan. Manufacturing employment is down by 37 percent since its peak in 1979, and politicians often point at the decline of manufacturing jobs as a symbol of the declining middle class \u2014 these jobs were once a clear path to a middle-class life for many Americans. But over the years, the U.S. economy has become increasingly service-based. Manufacturing employment has rebounded some, but it's hard to see all those manufacturing jobs coming back. In addition, to be clear, manufacturing jobs have fallen off, but not manufacturing production, which has grown over time, interrupted mainly by recessions. \u2014 Danielle Kurtzleben [Manufacturing employment did drop off steeply after China joined the WTO and fell further during the Great Recession. Since bottoming out in 2010, though, the U.S. has added 832,000 factory jobs. While outsourcing accounts for some of the job loss, it's also true that today's American manufacturers are highly efficient, requiring fewer workers to produce the same or more stuff. \u2014 Scott Horsley] Today, we import nearly $800 billion more in goods than we export. Can't continue to do that. [Trump's statement here is accurate. The trade deficit in goods was $762.565 billion for 2015, as noted on Page 6 of this census report. When combining goods and services, the U.S. trade deficit drops to $500.361 billion, because of a trade surplus on services. \u2014 Will Huntsberry] This is not some natural disaster. It is political and politician-made disaster. Very simple. And it can be corrected. And we can correct it fast. When we have people with the right thinking, right up here. It is the consequence of a leadership class that worships globalism over Americanism. This is a direct affront to our Founding Fathers, who America wanted to be strong, they wanted this country to be strong, and they wanted it to be independent and they wanted it to be free. Our Founding Fathers understood trade much better than our current politicians, believe me. George Washington said that \"the promotion of domestic manufactur[ing] will be among the first consequences to flow from an energetic government.\" Alexander Hamilton spoke frequently of the \"expediency of encouraging manufacturing in \u2014 in, in, in \u2014 the United States.\" And listen to this. The first Republican president, Abraham Lincoln, warned that \"the abandonment of the protective policy by the American government ... will produce want and ruin among our people.\" He understood it much better than our current politicians. That's why he was Abraham Lincoln, I guess. [Associating your policies with the Founders and Lincoln arguably has a sort of halo effect \u2014 you can link your ideas to figures that everyone loves (not to mention one Founder in particular who is so hot right now). But that doesn't mean protectionist policies of the 18th and 19th centuries could be justified in the same way today. We asked Barry Bosworth, a senior fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution, about this. [For one thing, he said, not everyone at the time agreed that protectionism was a good thing. [\"The issue was a major source of dispute in the 1800s between the agricultural interests who wanted trade and the eastern industrialists who wanted protection,\" he wrote in an email. One argument was that the developing U.S. economy had \"infant industries\" that needed protection. \"Of course, the infant industry argument is not attractive to the United States today when we have the largest and most advanced economy, but we do hear infant industry arguments from some poorer emerging markets,\" he wrote. \u2014 Danielle Kurtzleben] Our original Constitution did not even have an income tax. Instead, it had tariffs \u2014 emphasizing taxation of foreign, not domestic, production. Yet today, 240 years after the Revolution, we have turned things completely upside down. We tax and regulate and restrict our companies to death, and then we allow foreign countries that cheat to export their goods to us tax-free. How stupid is this? How could it happen? How stupid is this? As a result, we have become more dependent on foreign countries than ever before. Ladies and gentlemen, it's time to declare our economic independence once again. That means voting for Donald Trump. I'll do it. No doubt about it. Not even a little doubt. It also means reversing two of the worst legacies of the Clinton years. America has lost nearly one-third of its manufacturing jobs since 1997 \u2014 even as the country has increased its population by, think of this, 50 million people. At the center of this catastrophe are two trade deals pushed by Bill and Hillary Clinton. First, the North American Free Trade Agreement, or the disaster called NAFTA. Second, China's entry into the World Trade Organization. NAFTA was the worst trade deal in the history, it's like this history of this country, [It's hard to say what Trump's gauge is for \"worst in history.\" But NAFTA doesn't seem to have been catastrophic for the U.S. economy or for U.S. jobs. As we pointed out in our last Trump speech annotation, nonpartisan analyses have found only a small economic impact from NAFTA. The Congressional Research Service wrote in a 2015 report, \"NAFTA did not cause the huge job losses feared by the critics or the large economic gains predicted by supporters.\" -- Danielle Kurtzleben] and China's entrance into the World Trade Organization has enabled the greatest jobs theft in history of our country. [There is recent evidence that trade with China really has contributed significantly to job losses in the U.S. One highly cited 2013 study on the China-U.S. trade relationship found that \"import competition explains one-quarter of the ... decline in U.S. manufacturing employment\" between 1990 and 2007. One of that paper's authors, David Autor, told NPR's Chris Arnold this year that that amounted to nearly 1 million jobs. \u2014 Danielle Kurtzleben] It was Bill Clinton who signed NAFTA, people don't remember, in 1993, and Hillary Clinton who supported it. And the havoc it wreaked after he left office was unbelievable. [As noted by the Washington Post, more Republicans than Democrats supported NAFTA at the time of its approval. \u2014 Sarah McCammon [Also, as the Post's Glenn Kessler noted, NAFTA was negotiated under George H.W. Bush, not Clinton, and Bush signed it. As this 1992 article from the Baltimore Sun explains, that signing set the stage for Congress to vote the deal up or down. Clinton later signed it into law, after the three countries ratified it. \u2014 Danielle Kurtzleben] It was also Bill Clinton who lobbied for China's disastrous entry into the World Trade Organization, and Hillary Clinton who backed that terrible, terrible agreement. Then, as secretary of state, Hillary Clinton stood by idly while China cheated on its currency, added another trillion dollars to our trade deficits, and stole hundreds of billions of dollars in our intellectual property. And I've been talking about China for many years. And you know what? Nobody listened. But they're listening now, that I can tell you. The city of Pittsburgh, and the state of Pennsylvania, have lost one-third of their manufacturing jobs since the Clintons put China into the WTO. Fifty thousand factories across America have shut their doors in that time. And this factory, because of your great owners Gabe and Gloria, it's hanging in. Hanging in. But they just told me, it's not easy. Almost half of our entire manufacturing trade deficit in goods with the world and it's the result of trade with China. It was also Hillary Clinton, as secretary of state, who shoved us into a job-killing deal with South Korea. As reported by the Economic Policy Institute in May, this deal doubled our trade deficit with South Korea and destroyed nearly 100,000 American jobs. As Bernie Sanders said, Hillary Clinton \"voted for virtually every trade agreement that has cost the workers of this country millions, millions, of jobs.\" Trade reform, and the negotiation of great trade deals, is the quickest way to bring our jobs back to our country. To understand why trade reform creates jobs, and it creates a lot of them, we need to understand how all nations grow and prosper. Massive trade deficits subtract directly from our gross domestic product. From 1947 to 2001 \u2014 a span of over five decades \u2014 our inflation-adjusted gross domestic product grew at a rate of 3.5 percent. However, since 2002 \u2014 the year after we fully opened our markets to Chinese imports \u2014 that GDP growth rate has been cut almost in half. [There was also a major recession between 2002 and today \u2014 one that trade with China didn't cause. In addition, there was strong growth in some of those years. \u2014 Danielle Kurtzleben] What does this mean for Americans? Not good. For every 1 percent of GDP growth we fail to generate in any given year, we also fail to create over 1 million jobs. What a waste. And what a sad, sad thing. [Trump has favored other policies, like Brexit and his economic plans, which experts have said could potentially hold back U.S. economic growth. \u2014 Danielle Kurtzleben] America's job creation deficit, due to slower growth since 2002, is well over 20 million jobs \u2014 and that's just about the number of jobs our country needs right now to put America back to work at decent wages. Wages are very low because there's no competition and they're going to go up because we're going to thrive again as a country. The Trans-Pacific Partnership is the greatest danger yet. [Earlier this year, the U.S. International Trade Commission projected the TPP would have a modest net benefit to the U.S. economy by boosting the agriculture and the service sectors, though it would very likely depress manufacturing slightly, as reported by the Wall Street Journal. As the Journal wrote, \"If anything, the The ITC report and other reviews by economists show the deal's impact of the TPP is likely to be extremely small on the overall U.S. economy and most industries.\" \u2014 Sarah McCammon] The TPP, as it's known, would be the death blow for American manufacturing. It would give up all of our economic leverage to an international commission that would put the interests of foreign countries above our own. It would further open our markets to aggressive currency cheaters. Cheaters. That's what they are, cheaters. They're not playing by the rules. They're cheating. It would make it easier for our trading competitors to ship cheap subsidized goods into U.S. markets \u2014 while allowing foreign countries to continue putting barriers in front of our exports. Which is what they do. It's very hard to export to their countries. They make it very difficult. We, on the other hand, come on in everybody, come on in. Bad leadership. The TPP would lower tariffs on foreign cars, while leaving in place the foreign practices that keep American cars from being sold overseas. That's not all, mark my words. China will enter the TPP through the back door at a later date. They are watching; they are studying. They're not it in now, but they're gonna be in it. If it's good, they'll be there. By the way, if it's no good, they'll pass. It's the same way. Always is. The agreement would also force American workers to compete directly against workers from Vietnam, one of the lowest-wage countries on Earth. Not only will the TPP undermine our economy, but it will undermine our independence. That's what's happened. The TPP creates a new international commission that makes decisions the American people are no longer given the right to veto. These commissions are Great Hillary Clinton's Wall Street funders who can spend vast amounts of money to influence the people on the commissions and the outcomes. It should be no surprise, then, that Hillary Clinton, according to Bloomberg, took a \"leading part in drafting the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\" Please remember that. Especially in November. She praised or even pushed the TPP on 45 separate occasions, and even called it the \"gold standard.\" Hillary Clinton was totally for the TPP just a short while ago, but when she saw my stance, which is totally against, she was shamed into saying she would be against it too \u2014 and I will tell you, it was the same shame that she had recently when she was sort of forced into saying \"radical Islamic terrorism\" which she didn't want to say, but she was shamed into that one. But have no doubt that she will immediately approve it if it is put before her, and that is guaranteed. Guaranteed. She will do this just as she has betrayed American workers for Wall Street throughout her career. Her whole career she has betrayed the American worker. She's trying to put on a good front now. She will betray you again. Her career and her husband have signed so many disasters. And never ever forget NAFTA. Just never ever forget it, because you know what it's done and I know what it's done. And in touring I've seen the devastation that it's left behind. Here's how it would go: She would make a small token change, declare the TPP pact fixed, and ram it through. And you will suffer. That's why Hillary is now only saying she has problems with the TPP \"in its current form\" \u2014 you know what that means. That means like they'll make a little two-word change, and she'll fix it and she'll feel great. But she says in its current form \u2014 she will rush to embrace it again at her earliest opportunity. If the media doesn't believe me, I have a challenge for you and Hillary. Ask Hillary Clinton if she is willing to withdraw from the TPP her first day in office and unconditionally rule out its passage in any form. There is no way to fix TPP. We need bilateral trade deals. We do not need to enter into another massive international agreement that ties us up and binds us down. Like TPP does. A Trump administration will change our failed trade policies, and I mean quickly. Here are seven steps I would pursue right away to bring back our jobs: No. 1: I am going to withdraw the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which has not yet been ratified. [No. 2] I'm going to appoint the toughest and smartest trade negotiators to fight on behalf of American workers. [No. 3] I'm going to direct the secretary of commerce to identify every violation of trade agreements a foreign country is currently using to harm you, the American workers. I will then direct all appropriate agencies to use every tool under American and international law to end these abuses. And abuse is the right word. No. 4: I'm going tell our NAFTA partners that I intend to immediately renegotiate the terms of that agreement to get a better deal by a lot, not just a little, by a lot for our workers. And if they do not agree to a renegotiation, which they might not because they're so used to having their own way. Not with Trump, they won't have their own way. Then I will submit notice under Article 2205 of the NAFTA agreement that America intends to withdraw from the deal. No. 5: I am going to instruct my Treasury secretary to label China a currency manipulator. Which should've been done years ago. Any country that devalues their currency in order to take unfair advantage of the United States, which is many countries, will be met with sharply. And that includes taxes and tariffs. [This promise sounds a bit recycled, like those aluminum cans behind the candidate. Mitt Romney also promised to label China a currency manipulator in 2012. For that matter, so did Barack Obama in 2008. \u2014 Scott Horsley] No. 6: I am going to instruct the U.S. Trade Representative to bring trade cases against China, both in this country and at the WTO. China's unfair subsidy behavior is prohibited by the terms of its entrance to the WTO, and I intend to enforce those rules and regulations and basically, I intend to enforce the agreements for all countries, including China. [No.] 7: If China does not stop its illegal activities, including its theft of American trade secrets, I will use every lawful presidential \u2014 hey look this is very easy, this is so easy. I love saying this \u2014 I will use every lawful presidential power to remedy trade disputes, including the application of tariffs consistent with Section 201 and 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 and Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. And when they say trade expansion, they're talking about other countries, they're not talking about us, because there is no expansion. They get the expansion, we get the joblessness. That's the way it works. Not going to happen anymore. President Reagan deployed similar trade measures when motorcycle and semiconductor imports threatened U.S. industry. I remember. His tariff on Japanese motorcycles was 45 percent and his tariff to shield America's semiconductor industry was 100 percent. And that had a big impact, folks. A big impact. Hillary Clinton, and her campaign of fear, will try to spread the lie that these actions will start a trade war. She has it completely backwards. Hillary Clinton unleashed a trade war against the American worker when she supported one terrible trade deal after another \u2014 from NAFTA to China to South Korea. [Trump isn't just disagreeing with Clinton's policies. Powerful right-leaning groups like the Chamber of Commerce also disagree with him. The chamber reacted to Trump's speech with tweets saying that Trump's plans would cost jobs and that NAFTA has been good for the economy. \u2014 Danielle Kurtzleben] It doesn't matter, no matter where she went, the American worker was hurt and you will be hurt worse than ever before if she becomes president of the United States. That I can tell you. A Trump administration will end that war by getting a fair deal for the American people. And the American worker. The era of economic surrender will finally be over. It will be over. You're not going to see it anymore. Although, I can't guarantee it, because after me they're probably [going to] start doing it again. But we will have have four, maybe eight great, great, great productive years. And we'll never go back and we'll make sure we never go back. A new era of prosperity will finally begin. America will be independent once more. Independent once more. Doesn't that sound great? Under a Trump presidency, the American worker will finally have a president who will protect them and fight for them. We will stand up to trade cheating \u2014 cheating, cheaters, that's what they are. Cheaters. We will stand up to trade cheating anywhere and everywhere it threatens the American job. We will make America the best place in the world to start a business, we'll hire workers, and we'll open factories. And we'll get rid of these horrible regulations that make it impossible to do business in this country. This will also include massive tax reform to lift the crushing burdens on American workers and businesses. We will also get rid of all of these rules, and all of these problems, and all of the bureaucracy, which are destroying, absolutely destroying our job creation capacity, which we use to be the best in the world. And now we're getting close to the bottom, folks. We're getting close to the bottom. Many people think that these regulations are an even greater impediment than the fact that we are one of the highest-taxed nations in the world. We are also going to fully capture America's tremendous energy capacity. This will create, for our workers, and that's what we want, for our workers, growth for our economy and [to] begin reducing our budget deficits, which are massive. Yearly budget deficit, massive. Our trade deficits, we don't even want to talk about it. Our budget deficits are massive. Hillary Clinton wants to shut down energy production and shut down the mines. And she wants to shut down, and she said it just recently, she wants to shut down the miners. I want to do exactly the opposite. [Here's what Hillary Clinton actually said about coal mining jobs. \u2014 Scott Horsley] A Trump administration will also ensure that we start using American steel for American infrastructure. And aluminum. Just like the American steel from Pennsylvania that built the Empire State Building. That's what we're going to do. It built the Empire State Building. It will be American steel that will fortify America's crumbling bridges. American steel. It will be American steel. It will be American steel that sends our skyscrapers soaring, soaring into the sky. Beautiful sight. More beautiful with American steel. It will be American steel that rebuilds our inner cities. It will be American hands that remake this country, and it will be American energy \u2014 mined from American resources \u2014 that powers this country. It will be American workers who are hired to do the job. Nobody else. American workers. We are going to put American-produced steel and aluminum back into the backbone of our country. This alone will create massive numbers of jobs. High-paying jobs. Good jobs. Not the jobs we have today, which everybody agrees are bad jobs. We're going to create [a] massive number of good jobs. On trade, on immigration, on foreign policy, we are going to put America first again. We are going to make America wealthy again. We are going to reject Hillary Clinton's policy of fear, and her policy of absolute nonsense, because it's not working. And it's grossly incompetent, and we can't take it any longer and we're not going to take it any longer. We are going to embrace the possibilities of change. But real change \u2014 not Obama change. It is time to believe in the future. It is time to believe in each other. It is time to believe In America again. This is how we are going to make America great again \u2014 for all Americans. For all Americans. We are going to make America great again for everyone \u2014 greater than ever before. And I promise you, if I become president, we are going to be working again. We are going to have great jobs again. You're going to be so happy. You're going to be proud of your president. You're going to be proud, proud, proud of our country once again. Thank you.",

President Obama and Vice President Biden \"have tried to be fair and even-handed\" in the primary process, Sen. Bernie Sanders said Wednesday following a meeting with the president at the White House. Calling the meeting \"constructive and productive,\" Sanders cautiously praised the Obama administration's economic work, saying there is still work to be done. The two also talked talked about foreign and domestic policy and \"a little bit of politics,\" according to Sanders, who spoke to reporters after the meeting. The meeting came after Obama made comments that were seen as favoring Sanders' Democratic primary opponent, Hillary Clinton. \"[The] one thing everybody understands is that this job right here, you don't have the luxury of just focusing on one thing,\" Obama told Politico earlier this week, a dig at Sanders' 40-year message on income inequality. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said the meeting was first discussed last December at the congressional holiday ball. Sanders added that he was grateful that Obama campaigned for him years ago and vice versa, but that didn't mean they didn't also have their differences. Sanders also discussed Monday's Iowa caucuses, saying his campaign is \"feeling really good about where we are,\" but that in the end \"what the Iowa campaign ends up being about is one word, and that is turnout.\" \"I'm not saying we can do what Barack Obama did in 2008 \u2014 I wish we could \u2014 but I don't think we can. If there is a large turnout, I think we win. If not, I think we'll be struggling.\"",
