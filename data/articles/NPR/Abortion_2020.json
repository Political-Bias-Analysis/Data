Like many abortion rights opponents, Tom McClusky is feeling good about battles won under President Trump during his four years in office. \"He has probably done more pro-life things than many Republicans who have had two terms,\" McClusky said. McClusky, vice president of government affairs at the March for Life, points to Trump's reinstatement and expansion of the Mexico City policy, which forbids foreign aid groups who provide or refer patients for abortion from receiving U.S. funds, and similar rules for domestic family planning providers who receive funds through the federal Title X program. A push to reverse Trump's executive actions Those same Trump administration policies are a top target for abortion rights supporters, who want President-elect Joe Biden to immediately reverse what they call \"gag rules.\" \"The harm that has been done by the Trump administration \u2014 the harm that has impacted a lot of low-income and rural communities around access to basic family planning services \u2014 has been horrific,\" said Alexis McGill Johnson, the president of Planned Parenthood. Trump's policies have prompted many providers to leave the federal Title X program, reducing the availability of services provided almost by half, according to an analysis by the Guttmacher Institute, which supports abortion rights. A history that long predates Trump Gretchen Borchelt, of the National Women's Law Center, said Biden will take office at a \"crisis moment\" for abortion access. Borchelt said that's not solely attributable to Trump; it's the culmination of decades of effort by groups who've worked to restrict the procedure at the state level. \"And so we need this [Biden] administration to recognize that crisis and take steps not only to undo what the Trump administration did, which was add more and more restrictions, but actually to move us forward and get us to a better place than we have been,\" Borchelt said. Borchelt said she also hopes to see Biden support robust funding for reproductive health and agencies that support those services. She'd also like Biden to work to reverse the Hyde Amendment, which prohibits federal funding for most abortions \u2014 a goal that would require help from Congress. Meanwhile, Carol Tobias of the National Right to Life Committee said anti-abortion rights groups are fearful of what Biden's inauguration will mean. \"I think it will be a dark day in history for unborn children,\" Tobias said. Battles in the courts, legislatures Tobias said activists will continue working at all levels of government to pass abortion restrictions, including laws aimed directly at challenging Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion nationwide. \"We've had it for almost 50 years. There are legislators who want to be the sponsor of the bill that goes before the Supreme Court that overturns Roe v. Wade,\" Tobias said. McClusky, with the March for Life, said abortion rights opponents are feeling optimistic, with three of Trump's conservative nominees now sitting on the high court \u2014 most recently, Justice Amy Coney Barrett, whose nomination was quickly pushed through by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell just before the election. \"It's not just the Supreme Court justices,\" McClusky said. \"They've put in some fantastic \u2014 a couple of hundred circuit court judges as well all.\" Polls indicate a majority of Americans support the Roe decision, which guaranteed the right to an abortion but allowed states to increasingly limit the procedure as a pregnancy progresses. Later rulings, like Planned Parenthood v. Casey in 1992, gave states more room to regulate abortion under certain conditions. Codify Roe? Given the uncertainty around abortion rights in the courts, Biden campaigned on a proposal to codify Roe in federal law. Mary Ziegler, a law professor at Florida State University, said it's unclear what exactly such legislation would do. \"We don't really know what he means by that, other than the common denominator that there's a right to abortion and you can't ban abortion. But beyond that, who knows what he's talking about,\" Ziegler said. Biden also would need cooperation from Congress \u2014 unlikely if Republicans maintain control of the Senate. And with an increasingly conservative judiciary, there may be little Biden can do as president to stave off a wave of abortion restrictions in red states.",

Cory Booker, a Democrat from New Jersey, speaks during a rally in front of the U.S. Supreme Court in May. A recent Gallup poll found that more Americans want less strict abortion laws. A new Gallup poll finds a record number of Americans are unhappy with the nation's abortion laws \u2014 a shift mostly caused by growing dissatisfaction among Democrats. \"This is almost entirely driven by Democrats and Independents who lean Democratic,\" said Lydia Saad, Gallup's director of U.S Social Research. \"So that underlying trend is very clear, and it's showing up in the attitudes among all Americans.\" The poll finds 58% of Americans are dissatisfied with U.S. abortion laws while 32% are satisfied \u2014 a new low since Gallup began tracking this data in 2001. In the survey, 31% of Democrats polled during the Trump administration said they want less strict abortion laws; during the last Republican administration, that of President George W. Bush, 14% of Democrats held that opinion. Saad said the shifting attitudes among Democrats could be driven by President Trump's rhetoric and policies in opposition to abortion rights. She said it could also be attributable to a trend in many conservative-leaning states toward passing new abortion restrictions, some early in the first trimester, \"so that there is just perhaps much more awareness among Democrats under this presidency than there was in the past of what's happening at the state level,\" she said. The poll found that a nearly equal number of Americans say they want stricter laws (24%), as compared to those who want less strict abortion laws (22%). Saad said attitudes among Republican-leaning voters \u2014 who tend to believe abortion laws should be stricter \u2014 have remained relatively stable. Meanwhile, Democratic-leaning survey respondents have expressed a rapidly intensifying displeasure with the nation's abortion policies, which they see as too strict. \"The one really unique thing that we're seeing is that Democrats are now saying, 'Hey, wait a minute,' basically. Which they haven't said for awhile,\" Saad said. It's not clear how that shift in opinion could affect voting. Saad said Gallup's latest survey looking specifically at how issues shape voting did not find any noticeable uptick among Democrats listing abortion as a major motivating concern. \"It's possible Democrats right now are thinking in terms of the primaries, and so it's not a big factor...but when they turn to thinking about the general election, they will be factoring in the abortion issue more than they might have been in the last election,\" Saad said. Gallup conducted the poll of 1,014 U.S. adults ages 18 and older during the first half of January. The margin of error was +/- 4 percentage points.",

            "article_content": "After a historic year for abortion legislation in statehouses in 2019, the stakes have only increased for advocates on both sides of the issue as legislatures reconvene this year.  AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: Abortion is still legal in all 50 states under the Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision from 1973. With two of President Trump's conservative nominees now on the court, activists believe that could change, and states could soon have a lot more power to restrict abortion. As a result, many state lawmakers are taking a closer look at their abortion laws as they return to their state capitals this year. As NPR's Sarah McCammon reports, advocates on both sides of the issue are predicting another busy legislative session. SARAH MCCAMMON, BYLINE: There is a lot at stake for the abortion issue this year - a presidential election, a big Supreme Court case coming up and plenty of action expected in state legislatures. RACHEL SUSSMAN: Abortion is hanging on by a thread, and 2020 is going to be a crucial year. MCCAMMON: That's Rachel Sussman with the Planned Parenthood Action Fund. She says the stakes have gotten much higher since Justice Anthony Kennedy retired in 2018. He was often the swing vote in abortion cases. When President Trump replaced him with Justice Brett Kavanaugh, Sussman says the ground shifted. SUSSMAN: We saw a dramatic response at the state level in response to the Trump administration, to the Kavanaugh appointment. And a real active group of states pushed to ban abortion across the country. MCCAMMON: It was the busiest year for abortion legislation that Sue Liebel remembers in more than a dozen years of working on the issue. She's state policy director with the anti-abortion rights group the Susan B. Anthony List. SUE LIEBEL: Both sides are kind of throwing down, if you will. MCCAMMON: A report from the Guttmacher Institute, which supports abortion rights, describes an unprecedented wave of new abortion bans last year, with 17 states passing new restrictions. Liebel points to bills like one passed in Alabama last year, which makes performing most abortions at any stage a felony, or Georgia, one of several states to ban the procedure as soon as cardiac activity is detectable. Liebel expects more of the same in 2020. LIEBEL: I fully expect this year to be just as busy, if not more, because of the momentum that's just rolling across the country. MCCAMMON: Liebel wants more abortion restrictions to pass this year, such as laws banning specific methods of abortion or prohibiting the procedure based on the race, sex or disability of the fetus. Meanwhile, several states are pushing in the opposite direction. Kristin Ford with NARAL Pro-Choice America says many states have abortion restrictions on the books that are no longer enforced. KRISTIN FORD: But because of what hangs in the balance at the federal level with the Supreme Court, I think states that are controlled by pro-choice legislatures are going to be thinking really carefully about, what can we do to proactively safeguard, lock in the protections of Roe v. Wade that we've taken for granted for decades? MCCAMMON: According to the Guttmacher Institute, nine states passed laws last year strengthening abortion rights. Nevada removed some of its restrictions. New York and Illinois wrote many of the protections of Roe into their state law. Katie Glenn, an attorney with Americans United for Life, says lawmakers are watching the Supreme Court while thinking ahead. KATIE GLENN: And so legislators really have an eye towards, what will the law look like on the day after Roe in my state? And what do I want it to look like? What do my voters want it to look like? And that's kind of where their focus has turned. MCCAMMON: Both sides know that if Roe falls, state lawmakers will have tremendous new power to regulate abortion. And both sides are working to begin shaping that future now. Sarah McCammon, NPR News. Copyright \u00a9 2020 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "On the second day of confirmation hearings, Judge Amy Coney Barrett faced questions on her judicial philosophy. But she cited precedent that she could not answer how she might rule on future cases.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: President Trump's Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett is facing questions from the Senate Judiciary Committee today. She is an originalist like her mentor, the late conservative Justice Antonin Scalia. But she told the committee today that while she admires him, she will not be his imitation on the court. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) AMY CONEY BARRETT: If I'm confirmed, you would not be getting Justice Scalia. You would be getting Justice Barrett. SHAPIRO: NPR congressional correspondent Susan Davis is part of our team covering the hearings, and she joins us now. Hi, Sue. SUSAN DAVIS, BYLINE: Hey, Ari. SHAPIRO: These are grueling marathons for any nominee. How's Judge Barrett doing so far? DAVIS: You know, she is very poised and calm. She's been sitting very still at the table with her hands folded in her lap, almost motionless throughout the hearing. At one point, Texas Sen. John Cornyn noted that she had no papers or notes in front of her, and he asked her to hold up the notepad that the committee supplies. And she did, and she sort of smiled because it was blank and - sort of sending the message that Republicans want to send today that this is a woman that is very prepared for this moment. SHAPIRO: It's obviously a very contentious nomination, and the two parties have different agendas. Let's start with the Republicans. Where did they focus their questions? DAVIS: Well, Republicans worked to create lines of defense against some of the anticipated criticism. You know, President Trump has been very public about how he wants judges who would vote against Obamacare and even possibly on the outcome of the election. Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley put one of those questions to her directly. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CHUCK GRASSLEY: Have you committed to the president or anyone else that you will vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act if confirmed by - to the court? CONEY BARRETT: Absolutely not. I was never asked. And if I had been, that would have been a short conversation. DAVIS: Barrett wouldn't say if she would recuse herself from any case involving the ACA or the election because she said that was a legal process that she wouldn't weigh in on in the abstract. But she did at one point rather bluntly tell the committee that she has more integrity than to allow herself to, quote, \"be used as a pawn to decide this election for the American people.\" SHAPIRO: And besides the Affordable Care Act and a potential disputed election, abortion is another big topic of conversation. Did Barrett give any indication of how she might rule on abortion-related cases? DAVIS: Democrats tried. Dianne Feinstein, the top Democrat on the committee, asked her several times. And each time, it sounded a lot like this. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DIANNE FEINSTEIN: Do you agree with Justice Scalia's view that Roe was wrongly decided? CONEY BARRETT: Senator, I completely understand why you are asking the question. But, again, I can't pre-commit or say, yes, I'm going in with some agenda because I'm not. DAVIS: Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar asked Barrett if she believed Roe was a, quote, \"super-precedent,\" meaning that it was a case that could not or would not be challenged along the lines of Brown v. Board of Education, which ended school segregation. Barrett said she did not see Roe as a super-precedent because she said calls for it to be overturned have never stopped. And although she cautioned that while she didn't see it as a super-precedent, she didn't necessarily think that meant that Roe should be overruled. SHAPIRO: Well, just based on the numbers, Barrett appears to have the votes to join the high court before Election Day, which is three weeks from today. Is this Supreme Court confirmation fight having any impact on these elections? DAVIS: It is. I mean, three of the Republicans on this committee are in competitive races - Joni Ernst in Iowa, Thom Tillis in North Carolina and the chairman himself, Lindsey Graham in South Carolina. Graham's Democratic opponent, a candidate named Jaime Harrison, raised $57 million in the third quarter of this year. Ari, it is the most any Senate candidate has ever raised in any Senate race ever in American history. So these races are competitive, yes, for a lot of different reasons. But the death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg really did supercharge Democratic giving and enthusiasm in the homestretch of this election. So, yes, Republicans are likely to win this confirmation battle. They have the votes. But the political decision to do it before the election could make it more likely that they lose control of the Senate in just a few weeks. SHAPIRO: That's NPR congressional correspondent Susan Davis. Thanks, Sue. DAVIS: You're welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF CAUTIOUS CLAY SONG, \"COLD WAR\") Copyright \u00a9 2020 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "With just months before the election and an impeachment trial underway, on Friday President Trump addressed the March for Life, an annual anti-abortion rights rally in Washington, D.C.  AILSA CHANG, HOST: President Trump spoke today in person at the March for Life rally in Washington, D.C., an annual gathering of abortion rights opponents. Trump is the first sitting president to do so. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Unborn children have never had a stronger defender in the White House. CHANG: NPR's Sarah McCammon was at the march and joins us now. Hey, Sarah. SARAH MCCAMMON, BYLINE: Hi, Alisa. CHANG: So what was President Trump's message today? MCCAMMON: Well, he was there to rally his base. I mean, he went after Democrats, painted them as extreme on the abortion issue. And he reminded opponents of abortion rights who were gathered there of what he's done for them, that he's cut family planning funds to groups that provide abortions and named conservative judges to the federal courts. And without explicitly talking about the impeachment trial or the 2020 election, he portrayed the current political battles that are underway in Washington and around the country as really a fight between good and evil. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: They're coming after me because I am fighting for you. And we are fighting for those who have no voice. And we will win because we know how to win. MCCAMMON: And later, at least one prominent activist on the stage today explicitly praised Trump's record on abortion and told the crowd that what they do in November will have important consequences. CHANG: So give us a sense of what people in the crowd made of the first time a president has ever shown up at this rally. MCCAMMON: I mean, this is a largely friendly crowd for him... CHANG: Sure. MCCAMMON: ...At a time when he can use a friendly crowd. There were big cheers for the president, also for Vice President Mike Pence, who sent a video message with his wife Karen that was shot right in front of the Vatican, where he's met with the pope. And pretty much everyone I spoke to at the March for Life said they were really pleased with President Trump's record even if they may not always like everything he does. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE) ERMIDA AROCHO: He's a little rough around the edges, but he stands for the things that I believe in. And that's why I voted for him. CHUCK CALDWELL: As a person, he has some faults. As a president, he's doing a great job. JUNE MATSON: Whether he was pro-life before or not, it doesn't really matter because he has continued to prove that he will vote pro-life. MCCAMMON: That was Ermida Arocho of Chicago, Chuck Caldwell (ph) from Ohio, June Matson from Colorado. And that's really in line with what I've heard from so many social conservatives, really back to the 2016 campaign. CHANG: OK. So as you say, the president sort of ticked off all the things that his administration has done to support anti-abortion rights activists. Today there was another move along those lines regarding California. Explain what happened there. MCCAMMON: Right. It seemed timed to the March for Life. The Department of Health and Human Services told the state of California today that a law requiring insurance companies to include abortion coverage in all health care plans violates federal law, gave the state 30 days to rescind it. In response, California's attorney general said on Twitter that the president is, quote, \"sowing division for cheap political gain\" and vowed to fight that. CHANG: OK, so it's clear that abortion is a key political issue for many of Trump's base voters, and the president sees abortion rights opponents as an important part of his base. What else do they want to see President Trump do if he does win a second term? MCCAMMON: Well, the activists I've talked to say they really want more of the same - more of these policies, more judges. The next president, everyone on both sides is well aware, may get to choose another Supreme Court justice, so both sides are watching that. And reproductive rights activists tell me they're also feeling motivated. They point to a lot of activism and a lot of success in the 2018 midterms and also a handful of elections in 2019 around the issue of abortion rights. So that'll certainly play out again this year. CHANG: That's NPR's Sarah McCammon. Thank you, Sarah. MCCAMMON: Thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2020 NPR.  All rights reserved.

And, with two days left in 2020, Senate rushes to finish end-of-year list.  LEILA FADEL, HOST: A new, highly contagious coronavirus strain has made its way to the United States. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Health officials say they isolated one case in Colorado. The person has the variant that was first identified in the U.K., which has now turned up in numerous countries, including Canada. FADEL: NPR science correspondent Richard Harris joins us. Good morning, Richard. RICHARD HARRIS, BYLINE: Good morning, Leila. FADEL: So this highly contagious COVID-19 variant is in the U.S. What do we know about the Colorado case? HARRIS: Well, the Colorado governor's office identifies the person as a man in his 20s. He's currently in isolation in a largely rural county near Denver. Health authorities say they're working quickly to identify his contacts. But here's the thing. State officials say the man had no history of travel. That means he certainly isn't the first person in the U.S. to have this new variant, just the first one we know about. Federal officials had hoped that they could keep this variant out of the U.S. by cracking down on travel from the United Kingdom, but that clearly didn't work. FADEL: OK. So there may be other cases out there. How dangerous is this new strain? HARRIS: British officials have studied more than 2,000 cases and found that the virus spreads even more easily than the one that has been sweeping the globe. But the good news is it's no more likely to cause serious disease. Of course, it's a good news/bad news story because the bad news is that if you have a virus that's spreading far faster, that means more people will get sick. And when more people get sick, more people will get serious cases, and more people will die. FADEL: So how quickly could this variant of the virus spread throughout the United States? HARRIS: This virus can move really fast. It started out fairly localized in Britain. But over just a matter of weeks, it spread quite extensively and is now responsible for most of the new cases there. And that speedy transmission is bad news in the U.S. because, as you know, many hospitals are near the breaking point, and... FADEL: Right. HARRIS: ...Public health officials were already bracing for more extensive spread of the virus as a result of all of this holiday travel we've been hearing about. So a bad situation here looks like it will be even worse. And vaccines won't be widespread here soon enough to help. FADEL: But will the vaccines being administered in the U.S. work against this variant? HARRIS: Health officials don't have a definitive answer. But at this point, they aren't too concerned. Our colleague Joe Palca spoke yesterday with Dr. Anthony Fauci at the National Institutes of Health, and he said it would be quite unusual for a small change in a virus to render a vaccine useless. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) ANTHONY FAUCI: You know, you want to keep an eye on it. You can't be too confident. But I would be surprised if it really obviated the effect of a vaccine. HARRIS: If need be, the vaccines made by Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech can quickly be tweaked in response to a new virus. But, you know, if it comes to that, it would really set back vaccination by quite a bit. FADEL: So tell us about the new vaccine the U.K. has just authorized. HARRIS: Right. That one got the nod overnight. It was developed by Oxford University in cooperation with the drug company AstraZeneca. It's inexpensive to produce, and it's easy to handle. You don't need all those expensive and difficult refrigeration and freezing and so on. And that makes it really useful for use all around the world, where vaccines are desperately needed. But U.S. regulators are unlikely to accept this one quickly for use here. You know, the initial study on that vaccine had some really significant quirks, and that raised some concerns about really how effective it was, at least in the eyes of the U.S. regulators. So the vaccine is being tested here in the U.S. right now. And the FDA has signaled that it better wait for the results of that study before deciding whether to authorize it for use here in the United States. FADEL: OK. NPR's Richard Harris. Thank you. HARRIS: Pleased to be with you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) FADEL: This just happened in Argentina. (SOUNDBITE ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE: (Cheering). INSKEEP: People celebrated outside the Congress building in Buenos Aires. Lawmakers there voted early this morning to legalize abortion. Argentina becomes the first big nation in Latin America to do this. Some Latin American countries ban abortion entirely, while others only allow it in a few specific cases. FADEL: NPR's South America correspondent Philip Reeves has been following the events. He joins us now. Good morning. PHILIP REEVES, BYLINE: Good morning. FADEL: So take us through what this means for Argentina. REEVES: Well, it legalizes abortions in the first 14 weeks of pregnancy. Supporters of the bill say tens of thousands of Argentine women and girls are hospitalized each year because of unsafe underground abortions and that more than 3,000 women have died over the last few decades because of this. So they hope this law means that's now over. Argentina's president, Alberto Fernandez, who's a key supporter of this law, says abortions will now be safe, legal and free. But this obviously means much more than that. I mean, the Catholic Church still wields huge influence in Latin America. Argentina is the birthplace of Pope Francis. The church fought hard against this right up to the vote. And the pope made his opposition clear, emphasizing this with a last-minute tweet. The church has lost this fight, and women's groups who've spent decades campaigning for this change in Argentina are now celebrating a huge victory. FADEL: So the vote was expected to be very close. Was it? REEVES: Well, that's right. No one wanted to call this. It looked just too close. There were a couple of wavering senators. Even after the debate began, no one really knew which way it would go. In the event, though, the vote was 38-29 with one abstention - so a wider margin than many expected. I think one reason people were reluctant to call this is because we've been around this block before. In 2018, pro-abortion campaigners were really hopeful a similar bill would be approved by Congress only to see it fail in the Senate by a small margin. The difference now is that there's a new government and this legislation was one of President Fernandez's campaign promises. FADEL: Now, you spoke about the reaction a little bit. But what else can you tell us about reaction to this decision? REEVES: Well, you heard the shrieks of joy on the streets from that big crowd... FADEL: Yeah. REEVES: ...Of supporters outside Congress. I mean, they were there all night, many of them young women. The scenes were very emotional - tears of joy, songs, celebration, people letting off firecrackers. And from the footage that I've seen, there was often not a lot of social distancing. But this was a hard-fought issue that divided Argentine society. And there was another crowd, too, against this legislation. They also gathered outside Congress for this marathon debate. Some prayed at an altar that had been set up outside. They sang. And they were - obviously now they're very sad and in some cases angry, seeing this law legalizing abortion as a violation of a child's right to life. FADEL: Like we mentioned earlier, Argentina becomes the first Latin American country to legalize abortion beyond very specific circumstances. Do you see this impacting what happens in other Latin American countries? REEVES: Well, that's certainly what supporters of this new law hope. They hope it'll inspire other countries - Chile perhaps, Colombia perhaps. But in the region's largest nation, Brazil, the odds that this will make much difference aren't great. Abortion's banned in most circumstances. Brazil's president, Jair Bolsonaro, has said that while he's in power, it'll stay that way. FADEL: NPR's Phil Reeves. Thank you. REEVES: You're welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) FADEL: With two days left in 2020, the Senate is rushing to finish their year-end to-do list. INSKEEP: One item on that list is bigger COVID relief checks for millions of Americans. This is a little confusing. But to review, Congress already passed a relief bill with smaller checks. President Trump, at the last minute, demanded $2,000 checks that his party previously resisted. Democrats said fine and voted yes in the House. Now Republicans who control the Senate may vote, but they will tie the money to an unrelated bill the president also demanded. The president wants to strip social media companies of their protections from being sued for what people post online. FADEL: NPR congressional correspondent Kelsey Snell is here to explain. Hey, Kelsey. KELSEY SNELL, BYLINE: Good morning. FADEL: So Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell set the wheels in motion for a vote on the stimulus check and this liability shield for tech companies that Democrats call a poison pill. How do you expect it to play out today? SNELL: All right. So Steve said it was complicated, so bear with me. (LAUGHTER) SNELL: McConnell set up the process for a vote to combine the two issues. Basically, he said the president wants both of these things done, so we'll just combine them and do them together. The plan is to call every senator to the floor tonight for what's called a live quorum call. It's not something they normally do. But everyone will be called to the chamber to vote, and McConnell will try to skip ahead to a final vote on the veto override and then move on to the stimulus payments and the social media liability issue. FADEL: Now, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders says he'll filibuster a separate vote to override a veto of the annual defense bill until there's a vote on the checks. Will McConnell's plan resolve his concerns? SNELL: No, it doesn't really sound like it. Democrats say McConnell is setting up both the checks and the liability changes to fail. Basically, they think there are probably enough votes to pass the stimulus checks alone. There aren't enough votes to pass the liability changes, and combining the two is toxic. Democrats would provide the vast majority of the votes for the checks. And they don't support Trump's fixation on the - Section 230, which is those liability protections. Schumer accused McConnell of deliberately setting this up for failure. FADEL: Is that what McConnell's doing? I mean, why is he setting things up this way? SNELL: Well, you know, President Trump put his Republican allies in a really terrible bind over these checks. You know, most importantly, the two Republican senators from Georgia, David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, say that, you know, they want to vote for it. And their races, which are happening in Georgia - the runoff race is next week - would determine the balance of power in the Senate. And they've been contorting their message around these checks to try to, you know, meet the president's demands. McConnell and a lot of other Republicans oppose the higher direct payments in part because they could cost over $460 billion on top of the 900 billion Congress already approved in this last package. In some ways, McConnell could be giving himself an out. Loeffler and Perdue get to say they supported the checks, and McConnell gets to say he tried and blame Democrats if it fails. FADEL: Now, before I let you go, we've learned that a Louisiana congressman-elect has died of COVID-19. What can you tell us about that? SNELL: Yeah, Luke Letlow was 41 years old and set to be sworn into Congress on Sunday. His spokesman confirmed his death in a statement, saying Letlow died of complications from COVID-19 after being admitted to an ICU on December 22. He was a father of two young children, and he had just won a runoff election for the seat earlier this month. He is the first elected member to die from the disease caused by the coronavirus, though nearly 50 sitting members have reported testing positive. FADEL: NPR's Kelsey Snell, thanks. SNELL: Thank you.

Among the promises that President elect-Biden is expected to fulfill immediately upon taking office: lifting a ban that President Trump imposed on U.S. foreign aid dollars related to abortion. Specifically, the ban prohibits foreign aid funding for privately-run overseas-based groups that \"perform or actively promote abortion as a method of family planning\" for women. Activities that are barred include providing referrals for abortion or offering advice or medical information on the procedure. And this is prohibited even if the group funds their communications around abortions with non-U.S. sources. The funding ban was first imposed in 1984 by then-President Ronald Reagan and has been the subject of political ping-pong ever since. Each incoming Democratic president has lifted it. Each incoming Republican president who followed a Democrat has reenacted it. But with Biden, there's a twist: Even if he repeals the ban as expected, there's reason to wonder how much things will actually change on the ground for the people on the receiving end of U.S. foreign aid money. Here are five reasons: Biden will have a delayed start Because Trump enacted the funding ban through executive order, technically Biden will be able to lift it by an executive order of his own upon taking office. But in practice, \"it isn't as simple as signing a presidential memorandum repealing the policy,\" says Adrienne Lee of the advocacy group PAI. All the foreign aid groups eligible for U.S. funding will need to be notified that they can once again discuss abortion, she notes. Existing grant agreements and upcoming grant offers will need to be re-drafted. Lee says that means that, ideally, Biden's transition team would already have started working with staffers at relevant agencies such as USAID to lay the groundwork for those changes. But abortion rights advocates are concerned none of that work will begin until Biden is inaugurated. For weeks after the election Trump's political appointee who heads the General Services Administration, Emily W. Murphy, refused to sign a letter authorizing Biden's team to formally begin the transition process. And even now that the transition is finally underway, based on various bureaucratic steps the Trump Administration took to entrench the funding ban shortly before the election, Lee says she expects the Trump Administration will still throw up obstacles. \"Delaying coordination with the transition team delays all of this needed pre-work that minimizes the timeframe to get the global notification [of the ban's upcoming repeal] out,\" says Lee. Trump's version of the ban was far more sweeping While Biden's anticipated repeal of the funding ban will mark the third time a Democratic president has lifted it, the version of the ban that Biden will be reversing is far more sweeping. Previous Republican presidents had applied the ban only to funding of programs that offer family planning such as birth control. Trump extended it to the vast majority of global health programs \u2014 clinics that distribute HIV-AIDS drugs, for instance, or that treat malaria in children, or provide nutritional assistance. The Kaiser Family Foundation has estimated that this broader ban affected $7.3 billion in U.S. foreign aid programming for the 2020 fiscal year \u2014 compared to about $600 million that would have been involved if Trump had kept the ban limited to family planning programs. To comply with the ban many aid groups terminated partnerships and staff or completely restructured their operations. So once Biden lifts the ban, that many more groups will face the choice of whether to revert to their modus operandi pre-ban, says Jennifer Kates, the foundation's senior vice president and director of global health and HIV policy. \"To what extent are there going to be some implementers who just say, 'You know what, I'm not going to go through that again. It's too challenging to have to do this back and forth.'\" says Kates. \"That's a question we don't know the answer to.\" It's unclear how many groups changed their practices in the first place Essentially aid groups fell into three buckets: Those that were not engaged in activities that were prohibited by the ban, and who therefore didn't need to make changes to their practices. Those who did have to modify their approach in order to be in compliance. And those who decided not to take U.S. funding rather than cease banned activities. But Kates says there is not comprehensive data on how many groups were in each category. This makes it impossible to say how many groups will resume banned practices once the ban is lifted. That's not to say there isn't evidence that the ban had an impact. A September study in the journal Health Affairs found that of nearly 200 aid groups that receive money through the one of the affected U.S. funding streams \u2014 the President's Emergency Plan For AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) \u2014 28% reported they had stopped or reduced at least one health service in response to the funding ban. The affected services included delivering information about sexual and reproductive health, pregnancy counseling, provision of contraceptives, and HIV testing and counseling. Similarly, a study last year in the medical journal The Lancet found that the funding ban actually increased the rate of abortions by about 40% in the countries studied \u2014 likely, said the authors, because it led to a reduction in access to contraception and a consequent rise in unwanted pregnancies. Then there's the case of organizations that decided to forgo U.S. funding rather than comply with rules they deemed fundamentally at odds with their missions. A review released by the Department of State last summer found that only eight out of 1,340 primary funding recipients had taken that route \u2014 along with 47 groups that receive their funding as a pass-through from primary recipients. But several advocacy groups opposed to the ban questioned how thorough the review was, noting that, among other concerns, the review only covered the first two years of the ban. Also, while the review found that in most cases the U.S. government was able to redirect the funding to an alternate group willing to abide by the ban, the review documented several cases where this was not possible, or took time, resulting in substantial reduction in the provision of vital health services such as distribution of HIV medication. The U.S. could reduce its aid budget One of the groups that opted to give up U.S. funding was MSI Reproductive Choices (formerly known as Marie Stopes International). Sarah Shaw, head of advocacy for MSI, says while she hopes the organization can once again count on U.S. funding, it's not a given. Shaw says she's mindful of periods during Bill Clinton's presidency when \u2014 notwithstanding the fact that he had lifted the funding ban on coming into office \u2014 \"it was not such a great time for family planning because Congress just wasn't appropriating the funds.\" Also adds, Shaw, \"we've got a bear in mind that we're in the midst of a COVID pandemic which is putting tremendous domestic pressures on resources. We really are in uncharted waters.\" Zara Ahmed, associate director of federal issues for the Guttmacher Institute, a research groups that backs abortion rights, is hoping Congress will actually devote more funding to family planning. She notes that in 1994, at the International Conference on Population and Development in Cairo, the 179 United Nations member states \u2014 including the U.S. \u2014 agreed by consensus on a plan for expanding access to reproductive healthcare. 'It calls for two-thirds of the cost to be born by developing countries,\" says Ahmed. \"And then each donor country's fair share should be decided based on their economy's size.\" According to that calculation, says Ahmed, the U.S. should be providing $1.66 billion per year. But to date, she says, \"the U.S. has not lived up to that commitment, unfortunately.\" Other countries have also fallen short, such that by the Guttmacher Institute's calculation \"across 132 low- and middle-income countries around the world, there are more than 218 million women of reproductive age who have an unmet need for modern contraception.\" Then again ... Congress could pass a law that ends the ping-pong game for good Ahmed says another way that Congress could tip the scales is if it passes a pending bill that would prevent future presidents from re-enacting the funding ban. This could offer foreign aid groups that want to start offering reproductive services again the reassurance that they will not risk another costly round of disruption if a Republican wins the presidency four years from now. Two Republican senators have already co-sponsored the legislation \u2014 Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski \u2014 suggesting that there's a chance it could get adopted regardless of which party ends up controlling the Senate. Yet Ahmed is reluctant to predict that far ahead. \"I think that we could speculate in a lot of different ways about what might happen with the Senate, what bills they might prioritize. There's definitely a long way to go.\"",

            "article_content": "Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey testifies remotely during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing about how social media companies handled election misinformation.\n                \n                    \n                    Hannah McKay-Pool/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey testifies remotely during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing about how social media companies handled election misinformation. The chief executives of Facebook and Twitter defended on Tuesday the steps they took to limit election misinformation before lawmakers on both sides of the aisle who have grown increasingly critical of Big Tech. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey told the Senate Judiciary Committee they had been more aggressive this year than ever before in labeling misleading posts, clamping down on conspiracy theories and amplifying credible information about voting. Those measures started well before Election Day, as a record number of Americans cast ballots early. The social media companies have continued their monitoring into the weeks since November 3, as results were counted and later questioned by President Trump and his supporters. Testifying remotely, Dorsey told the committee Twitter flagged 300,000 tweets between October 27 and November 11 for \"disputed and potentially misleading\" information about the election. \"More than a year ago, the public asked us to offer additional context to help make potentially misleading information more apparent. We did exactly that,\" he said. While Facebook also labeled many election-related posts, Zuckerberg \u2014 also testifying remotely \u2014 instead emphasized the company's efforts to highlight authoritative sources of information in users' feeds and its voter registration campaign. \"All taken together, I think that we really went quite far in terms of helping to distribute reliable and accurate information about what was going on during this election,\" he said. Democrats and Republicans are skeptical of social media, for different reasons But some Democrats on the committee said the executives should be doing more to stamp out the baseless voter-fraud conspiracies and false claims of victory that the president and his allies continue to promote two weeks after Election Day. \"I recognize the steps \u2014 they're really baby steps \u2014 that you've taken so far. The destructive, incendiary information is still a scourge on both your platforms,\" said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn. He added that executives from Google's YouTube should also be facing lawmaker's questions about the spread of misinformation through video. Republicans once again pressed unsubstantiated claims that tech companies are biased against conservatives and treat their posts more harshly. When Zuckerberg told Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, that the company occasionally made \"mistakes\" in enforcing its rules, Lee responded: \"They may be mistakes but they're mistakes that rhyme ... and the consistent theme happens to be Republicans, conservatives and pro-life activists.\" Dorsey also acknowledged that Twitter had made its own errors. He said the company had been wrong to block users from sharing a New York Post article about President-elect Joe Biden's son, Hunter, in late October. After the decision sparked outrage \u2014 it was the initial impetus for Tuesday's hearing \u2014 Twitter quickly backtracked, changing its policy within 24 hours. \"This demonstrates our ability to take feedback amid the stakes and make changes transparently to the public,\" Dorsey said. Senators drill down on content moderation decisions Tuesday's hearing produced fewer fireworks than Dorsey and Zuckerberg's past appearances before Congress, including one just six days before Election Day. Lawmakers from both parties spent the bulk of the hearing focused on how Facebook and Twitter moderate what users post on their platforms, in many cases pressing them over specific decisions to label individual posts. Several Democrats grilled Zuckerberg on Facebook's decision not to ban former White House advisor Steve Bannon after he called in a live-streamed video for the beheadings of Dr. Anthony Fauci and FBI director Christopher Wray. \"How many times is Steve Bannon allowed to call for the murder of government officials before Facebook suspends his account?\" Blumenthal asked, pointing out that Twitter had permanently suspended Bannon. Zuckerberg said that if Bannon repeatedly violated Facebook's rules, it would take further action. Bipartisan agreement that more regulation is needed The one thing everyone at the hearing seemed to agree on? Tech companies need more regulation. Appetite is growing on Capitol Hill to consider new laws to address concerns ranging from antitrust and privacy to encryption and content moderation. \"There's Republican and Democrat concern about the power that's being used by social media outlets to tell us what we can see and what we can't, what's true and what's not,\" said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., the committee chairman. Even Zuckerberg and Dorsey said on Tuesday they were open to reforming long-standing legal protections that shield online platforms from liability over what users post. Zuckerberg said tech companies should have to produce transparency reports about what posts they decide to remove. Dorsey called for users to be given more control over the algorithms that determine what content shows up in their timelines. But what such regulation would look like is still unclear \u2014 especially since Republicans and Democrats do not agree on whether social media companies are doing too much, or not enough, to police their platforms. Platforms' next test looms in Georgia Just how effective the companies' efforts to curb election misinformation have been is still unclear. Facebook and Twitter both say they are studying the data and will share their findings publicly. In the meantime, the companies are already facing pressure over another political race: the special elections to fill two Georgia Senate seats in January, which will determine which party controls the chamber. \"I'm concerned that both of your companies are, in fact, backsliding or retrenching \u2014 that you are failing to take action against dangerous disinformation, exactly the same kind of voter suppression tactics that existed in the last election,\" Blumenthal said. Zuckerberg replied that Facebook is taking a \"similar approach\" to Georgia as it did with the presidential election. Dorsey said Twitter was doing the same, adding, \"we intend to learn from all of our experience with this election.\" Dorsey did confirm that one thing will change in the wake of November's vote: President Trump will no longer qualify for Twitter's policy exempting world leaders from some of its rules. Under that policy, tweets from the president that would have been removed, had they been posted by any other user, were left up on the platform. \"If an account suddenly is not a world leader anymore, that particular policy goes away,\" Dorsey said.

This year in Montana, Republicans swept every statewide and federal race, while also increasing their majority in the statehouse by 10 seats. Montana, once dubbed a purple state for its split-ticket voting, is now deep crimson. After four terms of a Democratic governor, a Republican will sit in Montana's governor's mansion for the first time in 16 years. Gov. Steve Bullock, a Democrat who lost his bid for the U.S. Senate this year, was term limited. Republican Congressman Greg Gianforte defeated Democrat Mike Cooney, the state's current lieutenant governor, by a wide margin \u2014 12 percentage points. In his victory speech, Gianforte said it's clear Montanans want a change in leadership. \"You've sent a loud message to Helena. A message to the State Capitol from every corner of this great state; that after 16 long years of single-party rule in the governor's office, it's time for Helena to change the way they do business,\" Gianforte said. The governor-elect is known for his fundamentalist Christain faith, his support of school choice policies and restricted access to abortion. Even as COVID-19 ravages the state, the pandemic was not a campaign priority. Gianforte has also said he would allow for concealed carry of guns without a permit. He ran on his success as a businessman, saying he would bring a \"customer service\" environment to state agencies. He's pledged to reduce taxes and slash regulations for industry. In 2017, Gianforte made national news when he assaulted a Guardian reporter. He paid a fine and was required to take an anger management course. Change in Montana is afoot Gianforte will be the partner that statehouse Republicans have longed for. Over the last decade and a half, the state's Democratic executives have blocked the GOP's most conservative policies. Several bills that current Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock vetoed could reappear in the 2021 session. Without the threat of Bullock's veto pen, some Republican lawmakers have already requested drafts of bills that restrict access to abortion and loosen gun control laws. Republican Speaker of the House Greg Hertz, who will move over to the state senate next session, has said that Republicans are looking forward to working with Gianforte on one of his campaign promises: more high-paying jobs. Hertz says the state can create jobs by cutting down on regulations around natural resource industries, such as logging and mining. Montana, known as the Treasure State, has long propped up its economy with an abundance of coal, hardrock mining and timber. \"Republicans have always believed that we can develop our natural resources responsibly and make sure that we protect our public lands and assets. That's a high priority to all of us,\" Hertz says. Gianforte has said he plans to replace the leaders at the state Department of Environmental Quality and Department of Natural Resource Conservation to streamline permits for these industries. Hertz also says he is looking to bring back a bill that Gov. Bullock vetoed that would have revised the property tax appeals process. Democrats respond State Sen. JP Pomnichowski, a Democratic leader, says her fellow party members will push back against these bills like they have in the past. But with fewer seats in their control, Democrats' sway will be weaker. Pomnichowski says her party can still be part of the \"working majority\" in the state legislature, pointing to Democrats and moderate Republicans working to pass a Medicaid expansion bill last session. But a number of moderate Republicans in Montana, along with several other states, lost their seats in the primary election to more conservative candidates, meaning Democrats will have fewer willing dance partners across the aisle. \"We need to get down to serious work about budget, public health and public health care in this state during a pandemic,\" Pomnichowski says. Montana is seeing a surge in new daily COVID-19 cases at one of the fastest rates in the country. The state's current Democratic governor has led the state through the pandemic by leaning heavily on county public health officials to make decisions for their own communities, but also through statewide mandates, like requiring people to wear masks in public spaces. Gianforte has been vague in his exact plans for responding to the pandemic but has said he doesn't think statewide mandates are the right approach. During his victory speech, he named the pandemic one of many issues he'll tackle. \"We face some real challenges. We need to defeat this invisible enemy that is COVID-19. We need to get our economy going again. We need to soberly address the state's budget. We need to overcome the scourge of addiction and meth,\" Gianforte said.",

Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., took it upon herself to help boost women's numbers in a party dominated by white men.\n                \n                    \n                    Jacquelyn Martin/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., took it upon herself to help boost women's numbers in a party dominated by white men. Minnesota's sprawling, rural 7th Congressional District has been represented by conservative Democrat Collin Peterson for 30 years. It was considered one of Democrats' most vulnerable seats going into this year's election, and the GOP flipped it when Michelle Fischbach won by 13 points. Rep.-elect Fischbach credited one particular Republican with helping her win: Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York.\u200b \"Whenever advice was needed, I always was able to call and talk to her about whatever kinds of bumps or things you would run into,\" Fischbach said. \"But in addition to that, she provided fundraising and dollars to the campaign, which is so important.\" Now, Fischbach is one of a record 35 Republican women who will serve in Congress next year, breaking the previous record of 30 and a sharp increase from the 13 GOP women elected to the House of Representatives in 2018. This year's number could still grow as more races are called. The Republican Party is celebrating that as a win, just two years after Democrats had their own record-setting year electing women. Stefanik's role in 2020 Stefanik has become the face of efforts to boost Republican women in Congress. She was in charge of recruitment for House Republicans in 2018, an abysmal year for GOP women. Among the 13 women elected to the House from the Republican Party in the midterms, there was just one nonincumbent candidate. After that, Stefanik clashed with National Republican Congressional Committee chair Tom Emmer over whether the party should do more to boost women in primaries. Emmer told a reporter that would be a \"mistake.\" Stefanik, for her part, focused her energy on building up her leadership PAC, E-PAC. Her committee promoted more than two dozen candidates and gave $415,000 to Republican women, including Fischbach. Stefanik credits the candidates with their wins, but she also feels that she played a key role. \"What I believe is different this cycle is I publicly made this a priority for the Republicans I served with in Congress,\" Stefanik said. \"I very publicly said at the end of the midterms in 2018 that we needed to do better.\" A giant partisan gender gap Even while setting a new record, the GOP is set to have around one-third the number of women that Democrats will have in Congress next session, according to data compiled by Rutgers University's Center for American Women and Politics. Republicans will also have around one-tenth Democrats' number of women of color. (Those numbers may yet shift somewhat as several races have yet to be called.) Altogether, according to the latest numbers, that means women will account for nearly 40% of Democrats on Capitol Hill, compared with less than 15% on the Republican side. In that light, University of Virginia political science professor Jennifer Lawless explained why she thinks GOP women's success this year is important. \"\u200bIt's a big deal in that the Republicans have demonstrated that when they make some effort to recruit female candidates, they see an increase in women's representation,\" Lawless said. \"But we haven't not known that. Since the 1980s, when women run for office, whether as Democrats or Republicans, we know that they're as likely as men to win elections.\" Lawless pointed out that Republican groups like E-PAC, though growing, are dwarfed by groups on the Democratic side like EMILY's List, which recruits and promotes Democratic women who support abortion rights. Changing candidates for a changed GOP The crop of Republican candidates this year was different from past years, not just quantitatively but qualitatively, according to Republican pollster Christine Matthews. That's because of longer-term partisan demographic realignment, with women \u2014 and particularly college-educated women \u2014 increasingly identifying as Democrats. It's a trend that may in fact be related to increasing polarization. Matthews says that realignment has changed which women run and what issues they run on. \"As, increasingly, college-educated women and men are leaving the Republican Party to becoming more rural, more non-college educated, male, [and] older, one way to appeal to that type of electorate is not anymore to be the Chamber of Commerce Republican woman, but to be the Second Amendment Republican woman,\" she said. Among the women who won this year are Georgia's Marjorie Taylor Greene and Colorado's Lauren Boebert, who not only ran on opposition to gun control, but have in the past expressed support for the baseless, far-right conspiracy theory QAnon. (E-PAC, for its part, lists Boebert but not Greene among its promoted candidates.) \"Identity politics\" in the GOP Promoting women politicians in particular can mean walking a tricky line in the GOP. Republican voters often say they are voting for the best candidate, regardless of gender or race. And there were echoes of that when NPR asked Emmer, the National Republican Congressional Committee chair, if celebrating women's victories qualifies as so-called \"identity politics.\" \"These people are not going to be great representatives just because of their gender, their race. These are people with incredible backgrounds,\" he said. \"And I'll tell you that we wanted the best candidates. That's what we were looking for across this country.\" On the other hand, while Stefanik stressed that she worked to back high-quality candidates, she also stressed that it's important for the party to try to make its lawmakers look more like the party itself. She also believes she's proven something to her party leadership.\u200b \"I was really proud that [Minority Leader] Kevin McCarthy, [Minority Whip] Steve Scalise and many of my male colleagues embraced this effort, including Tom Emmer, who learned pretty quickly that it's important to prioritize recruitment of women candidates and nontraditional candidates,\" she said. It's not clear what this will mean for how Congress legislates. Recent research has cast doubt on the popular view that women candidates are more bipartisan than men. And while there's limited evidence that women legislators tend to focus on different issues than men, it remains to be seen what effect a bigger number of women will have on the GOP's actions. Lawmakers, like voters, vote based on party, not gender.",

This year the seat is open, and the race is close.  MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: President Donald Trump carried Montana by 20 percentage points in 2016. The state is also full of split-ticket voters and has had a Democratic governor for 16 years. Steve Bullock, the current governor, is running for U.S. Senate, leaving an open seat. It could be this year's most competitive race for governor and has the potential to bring about major policy changes, as Montana Public Radio's Shaylee Ragar reports. SHAYLEE RAGAR, BYLINE: In early September, congressman and candidate for governor Greg Gianforte toured the site of a new building in Bozeman, Mont. The site will house a high-tech manufacturing facility. In an interview after, he reminisced about the tech company he and his wife built out of their Bozeman home. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) GREG GIANFORTE: We showed that when you combine good leadership with the Montana work ethic, people can prosper. RAGAR: They sold that business to Oracle for nearly $2 billion in 2011. The Republican candidate's pitch to be Montana's next governor is similar to President Donald Trump's. Gianforte will slash regulations for industry, reduce taxes and install new leaders at state agencies. His opponent, Democrat Mike Cooney, is the current lieutenant governor. At a recent campaign rally in the rural town of Dillon, Mont., Cooney talked about his family history. His great-grandfather owned a cattle operation in the area in the 1860s. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MIKE COONEY: My heritage here is one of the reasons I wanted to come here and talk about the message I wanted to give to you today. And that message is Montana is not for sale. RAGAR: Cooney, a career public servant, wants to safeguard and build on Democratic priorities, like protecting Medicaid expansion and pushing through a public preschool program. Recent polls have shown Gianforte with an edge over Cooney but within the margin of error. It's the only tossup race for governor, according to the Cook Political Report. If Gianforte wins, change is afoot. That much was clear during a recent debate hosted by MontanaPBS. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JOHN TWIGGS: Good evening, and welcome to tonight's Montana gubernatorial debate. RAGAR: Gianforte condemned the Bullock and Cooney administration for vetoing what anti-abortion rights advocates describe as a born-alive bill that would have required doctors to care for infants who survive abortions. Abortion rights advocates say the legislation is politically motivated. Infanticide already is illegal, and medical experts say surviving an abortion is extremely rare. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) GIANFORTE: I would have signed that bill. I am pro-life. He is not only pro-abortion. Apparently, he is pro-infanticide as well. And that is just not a Montana value. COONEY: That is a bald-faced lie. I resent you saying that. To call me pro-abortion - I am pro a woman making her own decision on her most intimate health care decision. And I will tell you any attempt to take that away from women in Montana, I will be vetoing. RAGAR: When it comes to gun control, Gianforte said he would support changing state law to allow for concealed carry of firearms without a permit. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) GIANFORTE: This is a point of very clear delineation between me and my opponent. I have an A rating from the NRA. I'm a life member. RAGAR: Cooney said he would oppose allowing concealed carry without a permit. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) COONEY: That just isn't the way we keep our community safe. RAGAR: Cooney stands behind the Bullock administration's statewide mask mandate, saying it's supported by science. Gianforte says statewide mandates aren't the right approach, and he'd leave it to personal responsibility. Montana, like many states, has experienced enthusiastic voter participation in the weeks leading up to the election and has broken its voter turnout record.

Kelly Loeffler campaigns in Buford, Ga., telling supporters she's 100% with President Trump.\n                \n                    \n                    Debbie Elliott/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler campaigns in Buford, Ga., telling supporters she's 100% with President Trump. How conservative do you have to be to keep a Georgia Senate seat? \"More conservative than Attila the Hun,\" is what incumbent Republican Kelly Loeffler advertises. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp appointed Loeffler to replace Republican Sen. Johnny Isakson who resigned at the end of last year, citing health reasons. Now she's running in a crowded special election to serve out the remaining two years of Isakson's term. Loeffler is a wealthy businesswoman and political donor with no prior political experience. She's the former CEO of a subsidiary of Intercontinental Exchange, owned by her husband. And she co-owns the WNBA franchise, the Atlanta Dream. But out on the campaign trail in Buford, Ga., Loeffler wears jeans and a red checkered shirt, playing up her rural roots growing up on her family's farm. She promises to deliver on conservative values \u2014 curtailing abortion, for instance, and calling for law and order. \"I will always fight for the unborn, and I will always stand up against the radical left and the cancel culture,\" she says. \"You can see what's happening in our country today. You've got anarchy. You've got mob rule.\" She's critical of Black Lives Matter, and objected to the WNBA's support for the movement, calling for players to instead have U.S. flags on their jerseys. She talks about it in her campaign speech. 'Trusted Trump defender' \"I was the only sports team owner to speak out on this particular issue,\" Loeffler says. \"And for that, it was suggested I should lose my team, my business, my seat in the Senate.\" Loeffler's biggest argument is that she's with President Trump 100%. Then, she takes aim at the other top Republican on the ballot, Congressman Doug Collins of north Georgia. \"He's one of the most liberal republicans in the House of Representatives,\" Loeffler alleges. For his part, Collins argues he's the \"trusted Trump defender\" in Congress, and uses a campaign ad to play up a Loeffler financial scandal. \"She's desperate to hide the fact that as the owner of the New York Stock Exchange, she spent $30 million trying to buy a Senate seat,\" Collins says in the ad. \"After a private coronavirus briefing, she dumped millions in stock. She profited off a pandemic while too many Georgians lost everything.\" 'Focused on the voters of Georgia' But this is no party primary. It's an open election with 20 candidates from all parties on the ballot in a year where Democrats have hope that Georgia is now swing state territory. Both presidential candidates have campaigned here recently, a rarity in a state where Republicans have long dominated federal races. The GOP battle between Loeffler and Collins clears a path for the top Democrat in the Senate contest, Raphael Warnock. \"The other side is having an interesting little fight,\" Warnock says. \"We'll let them take care of that, and I'll be focused on the voters of Georgia.\" Warnock is the well-known Black pastor of Atlanta's storied Ebenezer Baptist Church, where Martin Luther King, Jr. preached. Democrats see an opportunity to flip Georgia in part because the state has added more than a million new registered voters since 2016. And nearly two thirds of them are people of color. Now the party is trying to make sure they actually vote. At a GOTV event last Tuesday in predominantly African-American Jonesboro, Ga., local politicians chanted \"seal the deal, go vote\" ahead of speeches from the rapper Common and Democratic Senate candidates Jon Ossoff, who is challenging Republican incumbent David Perdue, and Raphael Warnock. Democratic Senate Candidate Rev. Raphael Warnock, center, at GOTV rally in Jonesboro, Ga., with the rapper Common.\n                \n                    \n                    Debbie Elliott/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Democratic Senate Candidate Rev. Raphael Warnock, center, at GOTV rally in Jonesboro, Ga., with the rapper Common. \"We say to America, witness the new south,\" Warnock tells the crowd. \"Georgia is the tip of the spear of a new south that is more inclusive, that is bold, that is forward looking.\" Warnock says he wants to expand Medicaid, and remove barriers to voter participation. He supports Black Lives Matter. \"Kelly Loeffler may have the privilege of playing politics with this issue,\" he says. \"But I come from a community where the issue of police brutality is real and it's a matter of life and death.\" Picking up lunch nearby, flight attendant Nicol Harris says she voted for Warnock because she likes the idea of a pastor instead of more divisive politics. \"We need some change,\" she says. \"There's no compassion for anybody or anything. And that's not what we're built on. That's not what we're about.\" If no one gets more than 50% of the vote, the Georgia Senate race will advance to a runoff in January. Republican activist Debbie Dooley says she can't support incumbent GOP Sen. Kelly Loeffler, and is backing U.S. Rep. Doug Collins in the crowded race.\n                \n                    \n                    Debbie Elliott/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Republican activist Debbie Dooley says she can't support incumbent GOP Sen. Kelly Loeffler, and is backing U.S. Rep. Doug Collins in the crowded race. Rep. Doug Collins' supporter Debbie Dooley says if he doesn't make it, and Loeffler is on the ballot, she will sit it out, and risk a Democrat winning. \"I just can't vote for her,\" says Dooley, president of the Georgia Tea Party.  Dooley has come to a street corner outside Joe Biden's rally in Atlanta to wave Trump flags at passersby. Dooley says she's been a Republican activist since the 1970s, but won't vote her party at all costs. \"If she's in the runoff, I can't vote for a Democrat,\" Dooley says. \"But I just can't vote because if you vote for the lesser of the evils, you're still voting for evil.\"",

AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: There's no escaping America's red-blue divide for one Colorado couple. They live each day with deep partisan differences on everything from President Trump to health care. Bente Birkeland from Colorado Public Radio spent time with them as they navigate this tense election season. BENTE BIRKELAND, BYLINE: When some families disagree on politics, they decide it's best to just avoid the topic altogether. That is not the case for Hilary and Matt Glasgow. They invite me into their living room to chat. HILARY GLASGOW: This is my husband Matt. BIRKELAND: Hi, nice to meet you. H GLASGOW: And this is Bente. BIRKELAND: Hilary and Matt have been married for five years and have three kids between them. The couple settles in on a large sofa. They say they fight about politics more than anything else. H GLASGOW: Probably at least once a day, we have an argument about something - at least. BIRKELAND: Hilary heads Colorado's state employee union. She's a diehard Democrat. Her husband, Matt, is a mechanic who works nights at a Target distribution center. He's a Republican. He voted for Trump in 2016 and is backing him again. His wife can't understand it. H GLASGOW: It was one thing to vote for Trump the first time. You know, like, America maybe had an idea of what he would be. This - we have crossed over into authoritarianism, into fascism. To me, it's like, how are you guys all so law and order, and then you let this guy come in and break every law? MATT GLASGOW: And I disagree with that perception of it. BIRKELAND: It's the media and the left that sensationalize and overreact to the president, Matt says. And he says no matter who wins the election, it's not the end of the world. M GLASGOW: Like, who cares who the president - don't you want healthy kids more so than... H GLASGOW: Yeah, but you might - if you have a president who can't manage a pandemic response, your kids are more at risk. M GLASGOW: Oh, my God. Yeah, you're right. The month long of looting and rioting in every single state in America had nothing to do with it. H GLASGOW: The only time that your side cares about anything is if capital gets destroyed. M GLASGOW: No. H GLASGOW: Like, oh... M GLASGOW: Like, I'm just saying... BIRKELAND: The Glasgows live in Pueblo, a majority-Latino town about two hours south of Denver. Even though registered Democrats outnumber Republicans, the county narrowly voted for Trump. Statewide, Colorado backed Clinton. M GLASGOW: Well, it was... H GLASGOW: No, I'm not saying that. BIRKELAND: After more than an hour of back and forth, it's clear that when it comes to politics, they don't agree on much. H GLASGOW: And you woke me up one night and you - I was sleeping. And you were like, do you really think that health care is a right and not a privilege? And I was like, of course that's what I think. Of course it's a right. Everybody... M GLASGOW: Hey, then let's everybody pay for it. BIRKELAND: Matt says the left's solution to universal health care is just to have the rich pick up the tab. M GLASGOW: It's so insane. Take all their money. It's still not going to work out like that, guys. H GLASGOW: I mean... M GLASGOW: So let's be honest about it. BIRKELAND: Both describe themselves as argumentative and opinionated. And even though they've never changed the other person's mind, they say that's not really the point. M GLASGOW: I don't see how interacting with somebody that might look at something different than you isn't - how could it be bad? Too many people are in bubbles. BIRKELAND: The couple does have some common ground. Hilary says it's important to her that Matt supports abortion rights and values unions. Beyond that, everything's fair game. H GLASGOW: Just 'cause I disagree with you does not mean that I don't love you. I still love you. BIRKELAND: That doesn't mean she was willing to turn in her husband's ballot at the drop box with the rest of the family like she usually does. She says, this election, he had to do that for himself.

            "article_content": "In the final stretch before the election, campaigns are trying to recruit new voters by finding friends and family members who can induce them to vote.  SCOTT SIMON, HOST: As predictably as BJ Leiderman does our theme music, elections bring endless political flyers to our mailboxes and yard signs and phone calls many Americans have learned to tune out. So as reporter Jeff Tyler explains, campaigns are now trying to reach out through trusted online friends. JEFF TYLER, BYLINE: The conventional wisdom is that voters are motivated by issues, like abortion or the Second Amendment, but Andy Roo Forrest disagrees. ANDY ROO FORREST: We think of ourselves as intelligent, rational humans who are examining ideas, but that's not what behavior science shows us. What it shows is that all of us are mostly influenced by role models and by our peer groups. TYLER: Forrest is executive director at Feel Good Voting, a nonpartisan group drawing on years of research to promote voter registration. So far this year, around 24,000 people have used the voter tools on its website. It pays influencers like Oneya Johnson on TikTok for a shoutout and a link. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ONEYA JOHNSON: If you are 18 and older, I need you to go click the link in my bio and register to vote. I know a lot of y'all thinking, oh, I'm only one person. What is my one vote going to do? A lot. TYLER: In Hattiesburg, Miss., 24-year-old Kam Tarvin was already planning to vote. But like a lot of new voters, she was uncertain about how to register. KAM TARVIN: Boom - the video popped up, and I'm like, OK. And it was easy. I was thinking it would be hard, you know, 'cause I've never voted. TYLER: Tarvin would be the first in her family to vote. TARVIN: My grandma is 75. She's never voted. But I'm going to try to get her to vote as well. TYLER: Again, Andy Roo Forrest. FORREST: When we get a new voter to come in, to establish new behavior patterns, to establish new habits, it may be hard to reach them. But once we have helped them establish those habits, we may have them for decades. TYLER: The concept of tapping friends and family for political campaigns, known as relational organizing, has exploded this year. JACK FISCHER: In this election specifically, relational organizing is going to be one of the key tools that we use. TYLER: Jack Fischer is a 20-year-old in St. Paul, Minn., working to get out the Democratic vote. He uses an app called Team. It harnesses the contact list in your phone to find people the campaign wants to talk to. FISCHER: I would go in, and I would see that I have a contact. Oh, look; Jeannie Burlowski, my best friend's mom from, like, 10 years ago, is one of the people that I need to contact. TYLER: He sent her a personalized message. JEANNIE BURLOWSKI: So I got a text from Jack. TYLER: Jeannie Burlowski is 58 and lives in Lino Lakes, Minn. BURLOWSKI: This was a wonderful text to get. It felt warm. It felt inviting. It was far different from having a robotic text from a presidential campaign. TYLER: They traded texts, and Jack helped her get information about early voting. Now that she has voted, I asked Burlowski if she planned to stay in touch with Jack. BURLOWSKI: Oh, you bet. I'm going to let him know what I did. I'm also going to tell him how great I feel that he reached out to me about this. TYLER: Relational organizing helped Democrats enough in the midterm elections that conservatives took notice. Minnesota state Senator Mark Koran is a Republican running for reelection. MARK KORAN: When you look at the acceptance of that message being delivered from a friend, it's far more impactful and powerful than any elected official who's out door knocking. The stats show it's almost two times more effective. TYLER: Koran uses a new app designed to get conservatives elected called SwipeRed. He hopes it will help him reach some of the 1.2 million eligible voters in Minnesota who are not registered. KORAN: They're not accessible through traditional communication channels. And so I think the only way to get to them and try to break into that group is through their existing friend and family network. TYLER: Koran still has time to mobilize friends of friends on SwipeRed. Minnesota allows voter registration up through Election Day. For NPR News, I'm Jeff Tyler. Copyright \u00a9 2020 NPR.

Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., looks on as Supreme Court nominee Judge Amy Coney Barrett testifies before the Senate Judiciary Committee on the third day of her confirmation hearing. In his final words Wednesday, Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., commended his colleagues on both sides of the aisle for remaining cordial throughout the first three days of Supreme Court nominee Judge Amy Coney Barrett's confirmation hearing. Graham said the professionalism exhibited by his fellow senators was a welcome relief in what has been a polarizing and contentious year. \"I just want to say to my Democratic colleagues, I have lost sleep over this hearing. I did not know how it would go,\" he said. \"Thank you on behalf of the country for allowing us to get through this hearing in a fashion that I think it is befitting of the Senate.\" Graham called Barrett \"one of the most amazing human beings I've ever met in my life\" and praised her extensive knowledge of the law. But he said, this process was never about changing anybody's mind, pointing to the Democrats on the committee. \"In another time, another place, you would get everybody's vote,\" Graham said. \"It's not about you. It's about us. Somehow we have lost our way.\" Graham acknowledged Democrats who over the past few days have argued Barrett represents the exact opposite of what the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg stood for. Graham said he hoped the American people would accept Barrett even though she is markedly different. \"I hope it's OK that you can be pro-life and adhere to your faith, and still be considered by your fellow citizens worthy of this job,\" he said. \"I see in you someone who's not only highly qualified to be on the court in every way possible, but somebody that has broken new ground in a positive way for the country.\" Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois also recognized the intense public scrutiny Barrett and her family have undergone during this controversial confirmation process. He apologized to her children for what they've had to endure. \"I heard you or someone say that it was painful, there were painful moments for some of the kids. I'm sorry. I hope that I was not the cause, and we were not the cause,\" he said. \"But I will just tell you, they are innocent victims, and they should not have to go through this.\" After the hearing, Democrats said there wasn't enough time to bring more heat on Barrett, and that Barrett wasn't as confrontational as Justice Brett Kavanaugh was.

Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, speaks during the confirmation hearing for Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett on Wednesday. Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, said he could only find a single case in which Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett didn't follow the precedent of her 7th Circuit Court of Appeals \u2014 and that was one in which the Supreme Court itself had established a new doctrine, he said. Crapo ticked through a series of statistics on Wednesday during a portion of the hearing in which he tried to puncture what he called Democrats' implications that Barrett, notwithstanding her emphasis about \"textualism,\" might actually prove to be a more activist member of the Supreme Court. Barrett stuck with precedent in most of her cases and in one example, she even was part of a ruling in an abortion case that contravened her own personal outlook, Crapo said. Barrett was in the middle of the pack of active judges on the 7th Circuit, he said. \"This is not the record of someone who is an activist in overturning precedent. This is the record of someone who follows precedent,\" he said. Republicans don't need to convince one another or Democrats to support Barrett; the majority can confirm her as it stands. But Barrett's sponsors have tried to defend her with comments aimed at a general audience, including in Crapo's remarks that he said he hoped would reassure people about what they would be getting on the new Supreme Court. The Idaho senator was responding to comments from Democratic critics including Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Chris Coons of Delaware, who had civil exchanges with Barrett on Wednesday that nonetheless included complaints or concerns about her record. Booker called himself disappointed about Barrett's inability to cite books, studies, briefs or other materials she's read about structural bias in the U.S. legal system, which, Booker argued, disadvantages Black people. Crapo called that insulting about a prospective justice, in Barrett, who has two Black children of her own. And in the case of Coons, he grouped Barrett with the existing conservative majority on the Supreme Court and suggested that, with her onboard, the high court would feel newly emboldened to revisit past cases in a way helpful to Republicans or according to the wishes of cultural conservatives. Crapo's recitation, he said, was intended to dispel that idea. \"I found it amazing that you would be accused of being a judicial activist because you are a textualist and originalist, as I understand your testimony, and your record and your writing.\"",

            "article_content": "Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, is considered one of the most vulnerable incumbents in the Senate. Her path to reelection is complicated by her past statements about how she'd handle a Supreme Court vacancy.  AILSA CHANG, HOST: Republican Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa is considered one of the most vulnerable incumbents in the U.S. Senate. This week, she's back in front of the cameras as a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee. And activists hope her handling of the nomination of Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court could make a difference to voters. Iowa Public Radio's Kate Payne reports. KATE PAYNE, BYLINE: When Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell blocked President Obama's nomination of Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court in 2016, Sen. Joni Ernst stood with her party. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JONI ERNST: During a presidential election year, the people should make that decision, and the people made that decision. And we did have a new president. PAYNE: That's Ernst defending her position in a 2018 interview with the Des Moines Register editorial board. And she promised to be consistent. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ERNST: So come 2020, if there's an opening, I'm sure you'll remind me of that. PAYNE: But now Ernst says she will vote on a Supreme Court nominee before the election. During a recent debate with her Democratic opponent, Theresa Greenfield, on Iowa PBS, Ernst tried to downplay what Amy Coney Barrett's nomination could mean for abortion rights. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ERNST: I think the likelihood of Roe v. Wade being overturned is very minimal. I don't see that happening. PAYNE: Ernst was vulnerable even before the Supreme Court fight. Recent polling shows Greenfield, who's never held public office, with a very narrow lead over Ernst. And a bare majority of Iowans think the hearings should wait. At a vigil for Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in Cedar Rapids the day after she died, Democrat Anne Salamon (ph) was livid. ANNE SALAMON: If the Republican Party wants to have any sense of integrity left, any shred, they will honor Ruth Bader Ginsburg. They will honor what they said a few years ago and not move on this. PAYNE: Money has poured into this race in the wake of Ginsburg's death. Greenfield raised $28 million in the last quarter. That's more than both candidates raised during the entire 2014 Senate race combined. Outside groups like Protect Our Care have blanketed the state in ads. (SOUNDBITE OF AD) UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As character) The winner of the presidential election should pick the next justice. But Joni Ernst disagrees. PAYNE: The question is whether this fight makes a difference for those rare, few persuadable voters like Valerie Floy (ph), who works in logistics management in the city of Davenport. She's not registered with a party and hasn't made up her mind in the Senate or presidential race. VALERIE FLOY: I'm usually a last-minute decision. I like to wait and see what all they have to say. PAYNE: Floy does think the confirmation is being rushed and says that could factor into her decision. But she's not really motivated by issues. Her focus... FLOY: How their views align with my views and my ethics and my moral values. PAYNE: The Supreme Court fight is not likely to motivate many voters like Floyd, says Patrick Murray. He directs the Monmouth University Polling Institute. PATRICK MURRAY: The Supreme Court nomination process has never been one on which this type of voter, this kind of swing voter, has put at the top of their list of their priorities. PAYNE: If Democrats are able to make it about issues like the fate of the Affordable Care Act and abortion, he says that could peel away some voters. But for those last persuadable Iowans, Murray says it's hard to say what could move them. MURRAY: It's not about demographics anymore. It's more about kind of this psychological gut feeling that you have about the candidates. PAYNE: What those gut feelings are could determine control of the U.S. Senate.

Kamala Harris, D-Calif., called on the Senate to hold off on confirming Amy Coney Barrett to the U.S. Supreme Court \"until after Americans decide who they want in the White House.\" Harris, the Democratic vice presidential nominee, is a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and the Barrett nomination hearing this week gives her a few moments in the spotlight in the midst of the presidential campaign. In her opening statement, she blasted the nominating process, as well as the hearing itself. \"More than 9 million Americans have already voted and millions more will vote, while this illegitimate committee process is underway,\" Harris said, adding that \"a clear majority of Americans want whomever wins this election to fill the seat.\" Harris attended the hearing virtually from her Senate office. She said the hearing brought more than 50 people together \"inside of a closed-door room for hours.\" \"The decision to hold this hearing now is reckless, and places facilities, workers, janitorial staff and congressional aides and Capitol police at risk,\" she said. Capitol officials said ahead of the hearing that the room was set up to comply with coronavirus protocols. Like her Democratic colleagues on the panel, Harris focused most of her remarks on GOP attempts to roll back the Affordable Care Act, and said  Republicans \"are trying to bypass the will of the voters and have the Supreme Court do their dirty work.\" A case related to the Affordable Care Act is scheduled to go before the high court on Nov. 10. Harris said the Supreme Court \"is often the last refuge for equal justice when our constitutional rights are being violated.\" \"Every American must understand that with this nomination, equal justice under law is at stake, our voting rights are at stake, workers rights are at stake, consumer rights are at stake,\" she said. \"The right to a safe and legal abortion is at stake. And holding corporations accountable is at stake.\" Harris added, \"We must listen to our constituents and protect their access to health care and wait to confirm a new Supreme Court justice\" until after the election.",

Collins says she's confident Maine voters make a distinction between their feelings about President Trump and her this November.\n                \n                    \n                    Fred Bever/Maine Public \n                    \n                \nhide caption Sen. Susan Collins campaigns in western Maine in September. Collins says she's confident Maine voters make a distinction between their feelings about President Trump and her this November. A version of this story was first published by member station Maine Public. For more than two decades, Republican Sen. Susan Collins has crafted a centrist brand that once made her one of the most popular politicians in the country. Now, Collins is the last Republican member of Congress from New England. And a combination of controversial votes and increasingly nationalized politics has her locked in the fight of her political career. In mid-September, Collins' campaign bus rolled through Rangeley and Farmington for a series of appearances with supporters. She made sure to bring up Height of Land, a pull-off on the Rangeley Lakes Scenic Byway with spectacular views of the nearby lakes and mountains. \"You know, I helped get almost $3 million for that,\" Collins said. And earlier this month, Collins toured downtown Waterville, where Portland Pie Co. owner Patrick Mulligan thanked her for co-authoring a coronavirus relief program that provided forgivable loans to small businesses. \"I'm trying to get another round going for those that are the hardest hit,\" Collins said to Mulligan. These kind of visits have long been standard for the 67-year-old Collins, but they've taken on heightened significance in this election. \"People still look at the impact on their own lives,\" she said. Protesters gather outside Lockwood Mills in Waterville, Maine, during a campaign visit from Sen. Susan Collins.\n                \n                    \n                    Steve Mistler/Maine Public\n                    \n                \nhide caption Protesters gather outside Lockwood Mills in Waterville, Maine, during a campaign visit from Sen. Susan Collins. In Collins' view, Mainers have benefited from her longevity, her deep roots in Maine and the power she wields as a member of the Appropriations Committee and its transportation subcommittee. She said all of that will be lost if voters elect her leading challenger, Democrat Sara Gideon, who she said lacks her experience and connection to the state. \"Nor would she have the clout and seniority that I have to bring much needed assistance into our state,\" she said. Collins' focus on experience is meant to draw a contrast with the 48-year-old Gideon, a two-term speaker of the Maine House of Representatives and Rhode Island native who began the race as a relatively unknown political figure. But the local focus is also a pivot from the national politics that have damaged Collins' once enviable popularity and now has her running in a virtual dead heat with a Democrat who has never run for statewide office. Collins attributes her position in the polls to a messaging campaign that she said has distorted her record and attacked her integrity. \"And I think after two years of that pummeling that unfortunately it has had an impact,\" she said. It's true that Democrats and liberal interest groups have unleashed an expensive and sustained campaign against Collins. But it's also true that Republican groups have responded in-kind: Outside spending for and against Gideon is almost equal to that for and against Collins, according to the latest data by the Center for Responsive Politics. And none of the spending would have much of an effect if there wasn't already trouble in Collins' once dominant coalition of voters. But there is. For Democratic voters \u2014 and Democratic women in particular \u2014 Collins' announcement on Oct. 5, 2018, that she would vote to confirm Supreme Court Judge Brett Kavanaugh marked a turning point. The pressure campaign directed at Collins by liberal groups before the Kavanaugh vote was intense. She has been a supporter of abortion rights since she first ran for the Senate in 1996. Her abortion stance appealed to groups like Planned Parenthood, which sometimes ran ads thanking her for votes in the Senate. But there's no more gratitude from Planned Parenthood; the group has already spent $1 million trying to defeat Collins. And its former director, Cecile Richards, worked alongside an activist group that pulled in nearly $4 million in crowdfunding inspired by Collins' Kavanaugh vote. \"When Sen. Collins cast one of the deciding votes to give a man credibly accused of sexual assault a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court, she sent an unmistakable message. She doesn't have the courage to stand up to Donald Trump,\" Richards said during a meeting with activists this summer when the $4 million was transferred to Gideon's campaign \u2014 a move that Collins has described as a bribe. Disenchantment among abortion-rights supporters overshadowed the pressure Collins faced from members of her own party, which had rallied behind Trump's 2016 vow to install conservative, pro-life judges on the high court. It resurfaced recently when Collins announced that she will oppose Trump's nomination of Amy Coney Barrett if the confirmation vote is held before the election. \"People are calling me and telling me they just can't vote for her anymore. These are all ... Republicans, mostly from the conservative part of the party,\" former Gov. Paul LePage recently told Portland radio station WGAN. LePage, a Republican, claims he's telling disenchanted conservative hard-liners that they have to support Collins because she could be key to Republicans holding the U.S. Senate. His defense of Collins might seem transactional, and it's definitely a sharp turn from four years ago. \"I think Susan Collins is done in Maine. I think her decision to go against the wishes of the Maine Republicans really cooked her goose,\" LePage told WGAN in 2016, reacting to Collins' decision to announce she could not support Trump, which she explained on PBS NewsHour. \"He lacks the temperament, the judgment, the knowledge and the self-restraint to be our next president,\" she said. Collins' assessment was cheered by Democrats, but it stoked the ire of Maine conservatives with whom she has long had an uneasy alliance. Those strains were especially acute during the first year the Trump presidency and after Collins cast one of the deciding votes to oppose the GOP repeal of the Affordable Care Act. Her vote on the ACA appeal made her a temporary hero of the left and the recipient of glowing portraits by liberal columnists, spurring talk that she might return to Maine and run for governor although she ultimately decided not to. Collins said she doesn't second-guess the decision not to run for governor and said she isn't dwelling on the halcyon days when her popularity was at its apex. Instead, she attributes her current situation to the multi-milliondollar campaign to unseat her. \"Tens of millions of dollars in dark money ads that lie about my record, defame my reputation, mislead people about who I am and attack my integrity,\" she said. Many of those ads link Collins with the president she didn't vote for in 2016, casting her as an avatar for Republicans' supine response to Trump's divisive conduct. Collins voted earlier this year to acquit the president of impeachment charges. But she won't say whether she supports the president this year, and she blasted Democrats for describing her as a \"stooge\" for male leaders of her party. \"The idea that Mitch McConnell or Donald Trump dictates \u2014 or any other man \u2014 dictates my vote is the height of sexism,\" she said. Collins said she's confident Maine voters will see through it and make a distinction between their feelings about Trump and her. Her bid for a fifth term might just depend on it.",

Kamala Harris, D-Calif., at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City on Wednesday. Updated at 12:57 p.m. ET After a raucous debate between President Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden last week that was marked by constant interruptions, name-calling and a moderator unable to control the discussion, Wednesday night's vice presidential debate marked a return to a more traditional affair. It's unclear whether it will be the last debate of the 2020 presidential campaign. Trump, who is recovering at the White House and sidelined \u2014 at least for the moment \u2014 from the campaign trail after being hospitalized with COVID-19, said Thursday he's \"not going to do a virtual debate\" after the independent commission that runs the debates announced that the second presidential debate, which had been scheduled for Oct. 15 in Miami, will now be virtual. Trump called the format \"a waste of time,\" adding he had no advance notice of the change. While most voters don't base their decision on the vice presidential candidates, 2020's contest is possibly different. Biden is 77 and has presented himself as a \"transitional\" figure to the Democratic Party's next generation. And the president is 74 and has contracted a serious illness. The vice presidential debate wasn't likely to change many voters' minds or shift the trajectory of the race, but it showed sharp contrasts between the two parties' agendas for the economy, health care and more. Here are four takeaways from the vice presidential debate between Vice President Pence and Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif.: 1. The 2020 election still hinges on the coronavirus. From the outset of the debate the pandemic was center stage. Spectators were warned not to remove their masks. The candidates sat at desks more than 12 feet apart and separated by plexiglass shields. It was also the first topic. Harris seized on the Democratic ticket's central argument that the Trump administration's handling of the novel coronavirus was \"the greatest failure of any presidential administration in the history of our country.\" She accused the president of covering up information about the virus when he was briefed in January by his national security team, and she argued that Trump still didn't have a plan to combat the disease. Pence defended the president's record and pointed to Trump's decision to restrict travel from China at the end of January as evidence that he took the threat seriously. He noted that the Biden-Harris team's plan to address the coronavirus with testing and the development of a vaccine mirrored actions the administration has already taken. \"It looks a little bit like plagiarism,\" Pence said. He also attempted to portray Harris' criticism of the administration's response as an attack on the sacrifices Americans have made during the crisis, an answer that seemed to fall flat. Throughout the debate, whether the question was about the economy or health care, Harris returned to the administration's response to the pandemic. Pence, in turn, touted what he called record-setting progress on developing a vaccine and pledged, as the president has before, that millions of doses would be available by the end of the year. Harris said she would take a vaccine approved by medical professionals, but \"if Donald Trump tells us that we should take it, I'm not taking it.\" Pence said Harris was seeking to \"undermine public confidence\" in the effort to develop and approve a vaccine. \"Stop playing politics with people's lives,\" he said. 2. There was an actual debate this time, but not necessarily answers to the moderator's questions. There was far less interrupting, angry cross-talk and fewer personal attacks than in the presidential debate. Moderator Susan Page, Washington bureau chief of USA Today, called for a \"respectful exchange\" and regularly reminded the candidates that answers should be \"uninterrupted.\" Pence and Harris didn't always comply. And Harris pushed back, calling out Pence when he started to step on her answers or take away from her time. She retorted, \"Mr. Vice President, I'm speaking. I'm speaking\" \u2014 making it clear she wasn't going to let a male debate opponent get away with any intimidation tactics. Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., speaks during Wednesday's debate. She accused the president of covering up information about the coronavirus when he was briefed in January and argued that he still didn't have a plan to combat the disease.\n                \n                    \n                    Robyn Beck/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., speaks during Wednesday's debate. She accused the president of covering up information about the coronavirus when he was briefed in January and argued that he still didn't have a plan to combat the disease. Both candidates frequently sidestepped questions altogether. The moderator chose to move on to new topics rather than pose follow-up questions, which was a lost opportunity on some key issues that could have made news or at least educated voters about the candidates' positions. Both ignored a key question that could be top of mind with Biden's age and the president's illness \u2014 what would you do if the president became incapacitated? Pence didn't answer how a Trump-Pence administration would protect preexisting conditions if the Affordable Care Act is struck down by the Supreme Court. He also didn't explain what he would do if the president didn't accept the election results or agree to a peaceful transition of power. Harris refused to answer a question posed by both the moderator and again by Pence about whether she backed what many liberal activists are pushing: adding justices to the Supreme Court \u2014 court packing. Biden dodged the same question in the first debate. Both also evaded a question about what they thought states should do if the Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade, which would leave the states to write abortion laws. 3. Candidates' strategies reflected the state of the campaign \u2014 Pence attacked Biden-Harris as extreme; Harris pivoted to Trump's record on the coronavirus. Pence's debate style is almost polar opposite of the president's. He was calm and disciplined and came prepared to paint the Biden-Harris ticket as captive to the extreme left of the Democratic Party, specifically on economic issues. The economy has consistently been the GOP ticket's strongest issue with voters, but that strength has declined as the country struggles with job losses and business closures. The vice president cited an analysis that Harris in 2019 was the U.S. Senate's most liberal member, and he repeatedly linked the Democratic ticket with the Green New Deal, a proposal pushed by progressives in Congress to remake the economy with a new energy infrastructure. Although Harris backed the proposal prior to her nomination, Biden has not. Pence also asserted that Biden's vow to roll back the president's 2017 tax cuts would translate into tax increases on Americans as soon as he took office, though in fact that would take an act of Congress. Harris appeared in the crowded Democratic primary debates, but she has had less experience on the debate stage one-on-one. She leaned on her skills as a prosecutor and came with a mission to hammer the case against Trump's handling of the pandemic and the fallout for the economy. She made Pence Trump's stand-in on the subject. In several exchanges, Harris sidestepped directly answering questions from the moderator and instead shifted the conversation to Trump. She used a question about the Breonna Taylor case in Kentucky to remind the audience of one stunning moment in the Biden-Trump debate, when the president declined to denounce white supremacists. 4. A fly generated the most buzz.

The debate didn't generate much news or many knockout lines, so when a fly landed and remained on the vice president's head for over two minutes, people were transfixed and many took to social media, unable to resist weighing in with jokes. Enormous attention was given to health precautions, ventilation systems and testing of attendees at the debate site. But the appearance of one insect was a scenario no one prepared for, and it was hard to ignore. Shortly after the debate ended, the Biden campaign posted an ad for a branded fly swatter.",

Catholics outnumber Evangelicals in Pennsylvania by a 2-to-1 margin. Editor's note: This story was updated to clarify that Abby Bogdan's views are her own and not those of her employer. The Trump and Biden campaigns this year are both targeting Catholics, with messages reflecting their differing judgments of how Catholic faith values might push swing voters in one direction or another. In the battleground state of Pennsylvania, it's a critical effort. Republicans hope opposition to abortion will drive Pennsylvania Catholics to support President Trump. \"The life issue obviously is number one,\" says Michael Korns, a Republican Party activist in Westmoreland County, a semi-rural area about 20 miles east of Pittsburgh. \"We are definitely trying to talk to Catholic voters who care deeply about issues of life and issues of culture. There is such a clear distinction between Donald Trump and Joe Biden, and I think it's difficult for somebody who's a conservative Catholic to ignore that.\" Catholics outnumber Evangelicals in Pennsylvania by a 2-to-1 margin. In 2016, Trump narrowly defeated Hillary Clinton in the state. This year, however, with Biden as his opponent, Trump is facing a lifelong Catholic and Pennsylvania native who regularly attends mass and carries a rosary. \"What we want to do is help people understand Joe Biden's character, his basic goodness, and [how he is] reaching out to people and trying to bring our country together,\" says Kevin Hayes, cofounder of Pittsburgh Catholics4Biden, a group of about 700 Catholics in southwestern Pennsylvania. Hayes says the Biden campaign has learned from mistakes made in 2016. \"The Clinton campaign did not do as much faith outreach,\" he says. \"They also made abortion more of a wedge issue.\" Hayes and other volunteers are making little effort this year to defend abortion rights. Instead, they have encouraged fellow Catholics to move beyond single-issue voting. \"I'm against abortion,\" Hayes says, \"but my pro-life beliefs are more than just anti-abortion. I really do believe in a 'conception-to-death' pro-life [view]. There are a lot of issues there, beyond just being born.\" Catholic teachings The themes of the rival Catholic outreach efforts in Pennsylvania reflect different aspects of Catholic church teachings. In a document titled Forming Consciences for Faithful Citizenship, updated in 2019, U.S. Catholic bishops characterized opposition to abortion as the \"preeminent priority.\" But the bishops also said they could not dismiss \"other serious threats to human life and dignity such as racism, the environmental crisis, poverty and the death penalty,\" and they said they did not intend to tell Catholics how to vote. \"We recognize that the responsibility to make choices in political life rests with each individual,\" the bishops said, \"in light of a properly formed conscience.\" For Donna Fischer, a volunteer counselor at her local parish, Our Lady of Grace in Greensburg, Pa., such carefully worded guidance was reassuring, especially given all the partisan Catholic messages she had encountered on social media. \"I started seeing posts like, 'You are committing a mortal sin if you vote Democrat' or 'You can't be a Catholic and a Democrat,'\" Fischer says. \"And then I started seeing posts from the other side, [saying] 'No, you can form your own conscience.' I don't think that all Catholics know that. I would really prefer to see a lot more information [explaining] that you're allowed to look at all the issues.\" Among the values highlighted by Biden's Catholic supporters are some that Catholics learned as children. \"When I went to Catholic preschool, I was taught by the nuns to respect others, treat others with dignity, treat your neighbor the way you would like to be treated,\" says Gina Cerilli, a Westmoreland County commissioner who is backing Biden. \"That's not what's happening in the White House right now. The president of the United States is spreading hate.\" For many conservative Catholics, however, the abortion issue is sufficient on its own to dictate their vote. \"You cannot be a true Catholic if you do not believe life begins at conception and ends at natural death,\" says Elaine Gowaty, a former president of the Westmoreland Federated Women's Club. \"Abortion is not an option. President Trump is pro-life, and that's what I am.\" The conservative organization CatholicVote.Org is ramping up efforts to mobilize Catholics behind Trump, launching a $9.7 million anti-Biden advertising campaign and releasing a 93-page Biden Report for Catholic Voters, highlighting stands Biden has taken on abortion, religious freedom, school choice, and judges. Such efforts in recent years have undermined support for Democrats in Westmoreland County, a once-Democratic stronghold that since 2000 has consistently supported Republican presidential candidates. Among the Catholic voters in the county who switched sides because of the abortion issue is Mary Turka, a nurse practitioner in the town of Murrysville. \"I was a Democrat until 2004,\" she says. \"If there was a Democrat who was pro-life, I wanted to vote them in, because I do feel it is better to have both parties represented. But it got to the point where there were no pro-life Democrats. I thought, 'You know what? I'm done. I'm going Republican.' I'm Republican now because of that one particular issue.\" Conflicting values Given the political polarization among Catholics, the differences in outlook may actually be obscuring some commonality in their approach to elections. \"The dominant value that causes Catholic voters to vote in either direction has to do with the dignity of the human person and how to construe that,\" says Christopher McMahon, who teaches Catholic theology at St. Vincent College in Latrobe, Pa. \"In one direction, it's the dignity of the most vulnerable, the unborn, the ones that must be cared for and protected. Then, toward the other end, it's the vulnerable of the minority, those that have been oppressed by economic injustice and warfare.\" In either case, McMahon argues, a \"Catholic sensibility\" is at work: \"You have this power and responsibility in your vote to defend the dignity of the human person.\" Conflicts arise because Catholics may not be entirely sure how to interpret that responsibility. Gina Cerilli, though identifying as a Democrat, is uncomfortable with the extent that her party leaders have embraced abortion rights unconditionally, among other progressive positions. \"The majority of Americans are right in the middle,\" Cirelli says. \"Unfortunately, the two parties have gone so far to the right and the left that we really don't have representation in D.C. right now.\" Biden disappointed some Catholic Democrats in Westmoreland County with his decision last year to withdraw his support for a measure known as the Hyde Amendment, which bans federal funding for most abortion. \"I would have preferred that he not have changed his position,\" says Kevin Hayes of the Catholics4Biden organization. Trump's Catholic supporters in the county, meanwhile, have had to accept his name-calling and insults, habits that they themselves may have tried to repress. \"Sometimes he says what I'm feeling, and I don't want to say anything like that,\" says Elaine Gowaty. \"But he does. And you know what? It's not bad. We've had politicians that are namby-pamby. He is not.\" Most Catholics in Westmoreland County seem to have resolved any internal conflicts they may have regarding their election choices this year, but there are exceptions. \"I don't think there's a party that is really a Catholic party for me,\" says Abby Bogdan, 32, a physics instructor at Seton Hill University in Greensburg, who adds her views don't represent those of her employer. \"My views are shaped by my Catholicism,\" she says. \"My fundamental value is the worth and dignity of a human person, and I think both parties have positions that are fundamentally not in keeping with that value.\" Bogdan's focus on \"the dignity of a human person\" as the defining Catholic value is a view she shares with many other Catholics, both conservative and progressive. Unlike others, however, she has not been able to resolve the problems she sees in the positions Biden and Trump have each taken on important issues. \"Abortion is a big one,\" she says. \"But so is immigration. The handling of the current pandemic is an issue. Health care is an issue. And I think the divisive rhetoric is actually a manifestation of not respecting other people. So in some ways I don't feel like I can vote for either candidate. I have been looking at third parties.\" Undecided voters like Bogdan are rare in Westmoreland County, an indication of how polarized the electorate has become, Catholics included.",

President Trump has made no secret of his intentions regarding the U.S. Supreme Court and abortion rights. During a presidential debate in 2016, Trump vowed to appoint justices who'd vote to overturn the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion nationwide. \"That will happen automatically, in my opinion, because I am putting pro-life justices on the court,\" Trump said. \"I will say this: It will go back to the states, and the states will then make a determination.\" Trump has followed through on naming conservative judges to the federal courts. But nominees for judicial appointments \u2013 including his latest, Judge Amy Coney Barrett \u2013 tend to be a bit more reserved when speaking about their views on reproductive rights. During her Senate confirmation hearings for her seat on the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 2017, Barrett \u2014 who has spoken openly about her Catholic faith \u2014 was asked about her personal views on Roe v. Wade. She gave a version of what's become a standard answer to that question for people in her position, saying, \"All nominees are united in their belief that what they think about a precedent should not bear on how they decide cases.\" Barrett, 48, has written and spoken about the issue before, including during an appearance at Jacksonville University in Florida shortly before the 2016 election, while a law professor at the University of Notre Dame. Barrett was asked about ways a hypothetical future Supreme Court might allow states to pass more restrictions on abortion. \"I think don't think the core case \u2013 Roe's core holding that, you know, women have a right to an abortion \u2013 I don't think that would change. But I think the question of whether people can get very late-term abortions, how many restrictions can be put on clinics \u2013 I think that would change,\" Barrett said at the time. Her record as a federal appeals court judge offers some potential clues to her views. In two cases where a lower court ruled to block Indiana laws imposing limits on abortion, Barrett voted to hear arguments that could have potentially overruled the lower court. But in a third case, involving buffer zones designed to protect abortion patients from protesters outside clinics, Barrett voted to uphold precedent allowing for those zones. Barrett's colleague, Notre Dame law professor Carter Snead, said it's difficult to predict exactly how she would rule on abortion-related cases on the Supreme Court. Snead described Barrett as \"someone who understands the complexity of the question that's gonna come before the court, and who understands the stakes ... and is going to be very thoughtful about how she proceeds.\" To Katie Watson, an attorney and bioethicist at Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine, Barrett's record seems pretty straightforward. \"I'd expect her to overrule Roe, and she appears to have four other sitting justices who are willing to join her,\" Watson said. While there is only so much you can read into Barrett's past judicial record, Watson said you don't really have to. \"I think the best evidence of her position on Roe v. Wade is that President Trump has said he will only appoint justices who are committed to reversing Roe, and there's no reason not to believe him,\" she said. On that question, activists on both sides of the abortion debate also seem to believe Trump. Barrett is receiving widespread praise from anti-abortion-rights groups, and opposition from reproductive rights advocates, such as Fatima Goss Graves, president of the National Women's Law Center. \"When you pair her record with the context that this issue is coming in, it paints this extraordinary picture that even though we're in a situation where the vast majority of people in this country support access to abortion, that we are gonna have something pushed through where the Supreme Court may leave us without that right,\" she said. While a majority of Americans favor some limitations on abortion, most also support Roe v. Wade. If Barrett is confirmed and the court indeed overturns that precedent, the issue would be left to the states \u2013 setting up intense fights in legislatures, and legal observers said, leading to an even more patchwork system, where abortion rights hinge almost entirely on where a person lives.",

The focus on the court just weeks before the election could help energize conservatives in key states. Supporters and opponents of Amy Coney Barrett's nomination to the Supreme Court wasted no time launching a high-pitched battle over her confirmation, with just 37 days until the election. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has the support of Republicans to move forward with the confirmation process and confirm Barrett on the Senate floor before Nov. 3, barring any development in her vetting. But in a flurry of emails, interest groups representing pro- and anti-abortion rights, gun issues, health care and more pledged to fight hard \u2014 making the Supreme Court an issue that could be front and center in the closing days of the presidential election. It also means it will likely be a central issue in key Senate races around the United States. Control of the chamber is in play this election, and Republicans are fighting off stiff challenges in several states where the issue is beginning to pop up in ads. Recent polls have shown Democratic nominee Joe Biden ahead of President Trump, but the focus has largely been on the president's handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Changing the subject to the future of the court and the prospect of a 6-3 conservative majority could help energize Republican voters in key swing states and inject new urgency into the election. A rally of liberal groups in front of the Supreme Court was scheduled for Sunday afternoon, and senators who expected to be on recess for the final fall stretch to campaign will return to the Capitol early this week instead to handle a confirmation process that will take center stage, with efforts to put together another coronavirus relief package fading. Barrett is expected to begin meeting with senators early this week, and the Senate Judiciary Committee is slated to begin hearings on Oct. 12. The panel is expected to hold four days of hearings with time for the traditional day of opening statements, questioning of Barrett and testimony from outside witnesses. That doesn't leave a lot of time for the panel to finish the FBI background check and review answers to the committee's lengthy questionnaire that nominees submit ahead of the hearings. The FBI on Friday noted that the scope of such a background investigation is requested by the White House. \"The FBI works background investigations through its established investigative process, and as expeditiously as possible, while ensuring that the background investigation is accurate and complete,\" according to a statement from the bureau. \"This should be a straightforward and prompt confirmation. It should be very easy \u2014 good luck,\" Trump said in announcing his pick at his Saturday event at the Rose Garden, but the crowd of supporters laughed. \"It's going to be very quick. I'm sure it will be extremely noncontroversial. We said that the last time, didn't we?\" Barrett is Trump's third Supreme Court nominee. His last pick was Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who came under additional scrutiny over a sexual assault allegation. But while Trump is predicting expediency this time, senators on both sides of the aisle and outside groups gearing up for a contentious process have no illusions that it will be easy, even with the outcome not really in any doubt. Mike Davis, the founder of the Article III Project, a group created to support the president's judicial nominees, said the night before Barrett's nomination was announced that his group would \"take off the gloves, put on the brass knuckles, and punch back on the left's attacks on President Trump's next Supreme Court nominee \u2014 a fight that will make Kavanaugh's look like a walk in the park.\" As Barrett acknowledged Saturday, she would be filling the seat left by the death of a trailblazing woman \u2014 Ruth Bader Ginsburg \u2014 who became a pop culture icon on the left, with the nickname the \"Notorious RBG.\" GOP supporters of Barrett were already trying to frame her pick as appealing to women. The Senate Republicans' campaign arm began selling T-shirts with \"Notorious A.C.B.\" emblazed on them. \ud83d\udea8 LIMITED EDITION: Show your support for Pres. Trump\u2019s Supreme Court nominee, Judge Amy Coney Barrett, with your very own Notorious A.C.B. t-shirt! Claim yours here \u2b07\ufe0fhttps://t.co/qi1eWqTz17 Conservatives are focusing on Barrett's record as a federal judge and the fact that she received support from three Senate Democrats when she was confirmed to the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 2017. They are embracing her as a justice in the mold of Antonin Scalia, for whom she clerked. Barrett said on Saturday about Scalia, \"His judicial philosophy is mine too.\" For McConnell, who is balancing concerns about control of the chamber with his chief goal of remaking the federal judiciary, the possibility of confirming Barrett, who would install a conservative majority on the court potentially for decades, is incentive to push ahead. But a Washington Post-ABC poll released on Friday shows that there could be backlash to the vote this close to the election. Fifty-seven percent of those polled said the nomination of a justice to the high court should wait until after the election, and 38% backed action now by the president and the Republican-controlled Senate. Trump was eager to make the issue a staple of his stump speech: He appeared at a rally on Saturday night in Middletown, Pa., in front of a large red screen that said, \"Fill That Seat!\" And he touted his slew of judicial appointments, each one a life term. Democrats, who recognize they don't have the votes to block Barrett's confirmation, are pivoting to make the debate about health care and the future of the Affordable Care Act. A case pending before the high court's fall session has the potential to dismantle the law, and Senate Democrats one after the other pointed out that Barrett has publicly opposed the law and argued that adding her to the court in the middle of a pandemic risks coverage for millions of Americans. \"The deadly COVID-19 pandemic has killed more than 200,000 Americans in a matter of months. Yet, instead of addressing the many life-and-death issues facing working families during COVID-19, Trump and the Senate Republicans are focused on jamming through this nomination in a transparent grab for power so they can achieve their long-sought goal of repealing the Affordable Care Act and ripping away healthcare from millions \u2014 including every COVID-19 survivor who now has a pre-existing condition,\" Illinois Democratic Sen. Tammy Duckworth said in a written statement announcing she was a no vote on the nominee. Outside groups framed Barrett as potentially casting the deciding vote on the court on the ACA. Demand Justice, a progressive group formed to oppose the president's nominees, dubbed Barrett \"anti-ACA Amy Coney Barrett\" and argued that the process moving ahead to hearings in weeks was unfair. Saturday night, the group projected the words \"SAVE HEALTH CARE\" on the side of the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C. On the Trump Hotel right now.Save health care. No confirmation until inauguration.https://t.co/8sHFTNtY8B pic.twitter.com/CNLpKEEtDV Eleanor Smeal, president of the Feminist Majority Foundation, a liberal group focused on equal rights and social justice, told NPR before the president made his Barrett nomination official that Ginsburg's death was a \"wake-up call\" that would help put the issue of health care front and center for many who may have taken the issue for granted. \"I know that it's energized our side. ... None of us wanted this to happen, but it does make very visual trends that we knew was there. Those of us who are very active knew that this is an extremely important election,\" Smeal said. Smeal's group joined with other women's organizations to create a super PAC called Vote for Equality that is setting up efforts on college campuses in seven states with competitive Senate races to attempt to educate younger voters about the legal issues that could end up before the Supreme Court. Biden's running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., is a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee and will get the chance to question Barrett, a moment that will likely get wall-to-wall national television coverage. But with little ability to alter the outcome, she may use the opportunity to highlight the issues she thinks are at stake in the election and spend less time drilling down into controversial topics that divide voters whom the Democratic ticket is hoping to attract. The two Democrats still in the Senate who backed Barrett's 2017 nomination to the federal bench \u2014 Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia \u2014 said they would vote no now because of how Senate GOP leaders are handling the process. \"I cannot support a process that risks further division of the American people at a time when we desperately need to come together. I will not vote to confirm Judge Coney Barrett or any Supreme Court nominee before Election Day on November 3rd. I urge my Republican friends to slow down, put people before politics, and give their constituents a chance to vote,\" Manchin said.",

In response to President Trump's nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the U.S. Supreme Court, Democratic nominee Joe Biden urged Democrats to vote in the presidential election to protect the Affordable Care Act. \"Vote like your health care is on the ballot \u2014 because it is,\" Biden tweeted. Congressional Democrats have signaled that's how they are going to try and fight Barrett's nomination. \"The American people should make no mistake\u2014a vote by any Senator for Judge Amy Coney Barrett is a vote to strike down the Affordable Care Act and eliminate protections for millions of Americans with pre-existing conditions,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a statement on Saturday. In his own longer statement, Biden noted that voting is already underway in the United States, and referenced health care and other issues important to progressives. \"They are voting because their health care hangs in the balance,\" he said. \"They are voting because they worry about losing their right to vote or being expelled from the only country they have ever known. They are voting right now because they fear losing their collective bargaining rights. They are voting to demand that equal justice be guaranteed for all. They are voting because they don't want Roe v. Wade, which has been the law of the land for nearly half a century, to be overturned.\" Barrett, a textualist, was critical of John Roberts' logic in upholding the ACA. \"Chief Justice Roberts pushed the Affordable Care Act beyond its plausible meaning to save the statute,\" Barrett wrote in 2017. \"He construed the penalty imposed on those without health insurance as a tax, which permitted him to sustain the statute as a valid exercise of the taxing power; had he treated the payment as the statute did \u2014 as a penalty \u2014 he would have had to invalidate the statute as lying beyond Congress's commerce power.\" On abortion, Barrett has said she expected the Supreme Court would uphold the core of Roe v. Wade, giving women the right to an abortion, but she said she thought it was likely that restrictions would be increased. But that was before Trump was elected and before the court became majority conservative, so it's not clear how far Barrett would go exactly. Biden and his running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris, argued in their statements that a Supreme Court nominee should be left to whoever wins the presidency. \"Americans across the country are already casting votes, and we will soon know the president and senators who will be sworn in next January,\" said Harris, who also serves on the Judiciary Committee, which is is responsible for the hearings of court nominees. \"We must respect Americans' voices and allow the winners of the election to nominate and confirm the next Supreme Court Justice.\" Democrats especially feel that way because Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., refused to even hold a hearing for then-President Barack Obama's pick to replace the late-Justice Antonin Scalia on the court. Scalia died in February 2016, many more months ahead of that election than this vacancy. \"Just yesterday, I paid my respects to the legendary Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who devoted her life to fighting for Equal Justice Under Law and a more fair and just world,\" Harris added in her statement. \"Her passing is devastating, and it would be a travesty to replace her with a justice who is being selected to undo her legacy and erase everything she did for our country.\" The Senate Judiciary Committee is expected to begin Barrett's confirmation hearings on Oct. 12, an aide told NPR on Saturday.",

            "article_content": "The Supreme Court vacancy is not at the top of the minds of the Colorado voters we spoke to this week, while health care and the pandemic are.  SCOTT SIMON, HOST: Candidates and pollsters across the country are trying to figure out what voters are thinking with an election like no other mere weeks away. Today, we begin a series of conversations with our member station reporters about what voters in the region are telling them. Colorado Public Radio's Bente Birkeland has been hearing from a diverse group of voters there and joins us now. Bente, thanks so much for being with us. BENTE BIRKELAND, BYLINE: Thank you for having me. SIMON: Of course, the national news - a lot of it's been on President Trump's push to confirm a new Supreme Court justice. Is this an important issue for voters in Colorado? BIRKELAND: It was not top of mind among the voters I talked to this week. I did go to a rally on Monday where Democratic activists were calling on Republican Senator Cory Gardner to block the president's Supreme Court nominee, which, of course, the senator has since said he would not do. But other than that, no one I spoke to said this issue was driving them or would make any difference at all in terms of how they'd vote. I called up one Republican voter I'd recently spoken to on the phone. Her name's Amy Carlson (ph). And she said the Supreme Court was already a reason for her support of President Trump. She's also expecting the nomination fight to be similar to what happened with Brett Kavanaugh - very contentious. AMY CARLSON: He was beaten to death by all those hearings and everything. I just don't think - it hasn't really changed anything for me. SIMON: Let me ask you about the profile of the candidates themselves with voters. Do they have strong opinions on Donald Trump and/or Joe Biden? BIRKELAND: Yes and no. There's an overwhelming feeling of dejectedness, not believing in the system, not trusting it's going to make their lives better. Most people have very strong opinions about the president, but for those who don't like him, no one told me they were excited about Joe Biden either. I spoke to Mark Kaplan (ph), and he's a Democrat. And he owns a home restoration company. He said he's concerned about the economy and he's had to lay off over 90% of his 25 employees. MARK KAPLAN: Politics - I mean, it is what it is. They have their kind of a way of misleading their own parties. I'm not going to vote this year. BIRKELAND: And I asked him why. Is this the first time you won't have voted? KAPLAN: This is the first time I'm kind of like, I don't think my vote's going to matter anyway. I really don't think that. BIRKELAND: So this hardship and sense of hopelessness seemed really central to the people I happened to talk to. Kadoranne Turner (ph) was laid off from her job when COVID-19 hit. She's 25. And she's talking about why she doesn't support President Trump. KADORANNE TURNER: Do I really think Trump cares about anyone? Do I think anybody in this race cares? I don't because if they did, it'd be a different situation. People would not have lost their homes. People would not have lost their jobs. Minority races still don't matter because people are still dying. BIRKELAND: And I think it is worth noting that while Turner said she doesn't support President Trump, she also hasn't seen enough of Joe Biden to really support him either. And her husband, Marvin King Jr. (ph), told me he wasn't voting at all. SIMON: You can hear resignation in those voices. Aside from the presidential race, voters with whom you spoke - maybe a little bit more interested in local issues, including the Senate race. The polls there show former Governor John Hickenlooper, a Democrat, of course, has a lead on Republican Senator Cory Gardner. BIRKELAND: Most voters say they haven't made up their minds yet or they need to do more research. And they do plan to vote in that race. I've spoken to a few Democrats who don't like that Hickenlooper has these ethics violations. He had to pay fines for accepting gifts when he was governor. But Hickenlooper is still well-known, and he's well-liked by a lot of people who aren't necessarily of the political class. He was governor for eight years, and he was front and center on issues like floods and wildfires. He's a moderate. But Gardner, despite being in the U.S. Senate for six years, he isn't as well-known. One voter did tell me they think Gardner is in lockstep with the president. That's a message Democrats will be trying to drive home in the coming weeks. President Trump did not win Colorado in 2016. SIMON: Bente, please tell us about some of the measures that are on the ballot, also, this fall. BIRKELAND: Well, we have about a dozen statewide ballot questions, everything from banning abortions after 22 weeks. There's a proposal to create paid family leave. Another measure would reintroduce gray wolves. And supporters are hoping to return those predators and interconnect a population of Rocky Mountain wolves that stretches from Alaska to Mexico. SIMON: Colorado Public Radio's Bente Birkeland, thanks so much for being with us. BIRKELAND: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) Copyright \u00a9 2020 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Republicans expect President Trump to name Judge Amy Coney Barrett as the next nominee to the Supreme Court, according to a source with knowledge of the process, but the source cautioned that Trump could change his mind. The source declined to be named, because the individual was not authorized to confirm the selection before the president announced it. The White House declined comment. Trump told reporters on the tarmac at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland on Friday that he had made a decision on whom he would nominate to replace the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg but said that \"we have not made our intentions felt.\" He added that he did not meet with Judge Barbara Lagoa, who was also under consideration to replace Ginsburg, during his trip to Miami and Atlanta. Barrett, who has served on the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago for three years, has a clear conservative record. If confirmed, the 48-year-old would become the youngest justice on the Supreme Court and would likely serve for decades to come. Barrett is widely admired among conservatives for her views against abortion rights and the Affordable Care Act. Trump considered Barrett to succeed Justice Anthony Kennedy when he retired in 2018 but instead chose Brett Kavanaugh, reportedly saying he was \"saving\" Barrett for Ginsburg's seat, should she die or retire during his presidency. Trump nominated Barrett to the federal bench in 2017. As a federal judge, she has written about 100 opinions, accumulating a judicial record on issues such as guns, abortion rights and campus sexual assault that conservatives have lauded. Before her ascent to the federal bench, Barrett taught law for 15 years at the University of Notre Dame, where she graduated from law school. She also clerked for Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, a conservative legend on the court, who like Barrett does, subscribed to an \"originalist\" or \"textualist\" judicial philosophy in which constitutional questions are considered through the lens of the framers' original intent. Democrats have raised concerns about how Barrett's devout Catholic faith may influence her interpretation of legal issues such as abortion rights. Democrats raising that issue in Barrett's confirmation hearing to the appellate bench drew hackles from Republicans; Barrett said she would not let her religion interfere with her actions as a judge. Barrett's stance on abortion and the landmark decision Roe v. Wade are likely to play a prominent role in her confirmation hearing to the high court. In the past, Barrett has said she could envision the court upholding the basic right to an abortion but chipping away at the precedent in a way that would give states leeway to make it harder to obtain one. But that was before Trump's election and before the court became majority conservative. If the Senate confirms Barrett to replace Ginsburg, conservatives would solidify their majority at 6-3 and could potentially make a more sweeping ruling on abortion or the Affordable Care Act, which has twice been preserved by the swing vote of Chief Justice John Roberts. Democrats are framing the fight over the Supreme Court seat as primarily a battle to preserve health care, namely under the Affordable Care Act. Health care was a winning issue for Democrats during the 2018 midterms, and the party now hopes that issue can help galvanize opposition to Trump's pick. Trump and the Republicans want to vote on a nominee before Election Day and began promising to hold a vote without delay shortly after the court announced Ginsburg had died. Trump said this week that he wants his nominee confirmed before the election, predicting that the result may come down to a decision before the Supreme Court, as it did in 2000. But Democrats point to the successful efforts of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to block President Barack Obama's nomination to the court, Merrick Garland, in 2016 because the vacancy came up too close to the election. Now, Democrats, including Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, say Republicans should follow the precedent they set back then and allow whoever wins the 2020 election to nominate Ginsburg's successor. Despite early signals from Republican Sens. Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski that they would join Democrats in opposing a vote before the election, enough Republicans have said they would likely support a vote on Trump's selection, paving the way for the president to put a third justice on the court after just four years in office.",

That took place in the run-up to her presidential bid. Now, she'll face the spotlight as her party's vice presidential nominee.\n                \n                    \n                    Zach Gibson/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., questions Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh during his 2018 confirmation hearing on Capitol Hill. That took place in the run-up to her presidential bid. Now, she'll face the spotlight as her party's vice presidential nominee. Some of the most memorable moments of Kamala Harris' political career have come in the Senate committee hearing rooms. The list of witnesses and nominees the California senator has flustered or put on the defensive is long, and it includes many top conservatives whom progressives villainize: Attorney General William Barr, former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, former White House chief of staff John Kelly and, perhaps atop that list, Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. During Kavanaugh's contentious confirmation hearings in 2018, Harris' questions often yielded some of the biggest moments. So it was notable that when reporters asked whether she plans to even take part in the upcoming confirmation hearing for President Trump's yet-to-be-named pick to fill the seat held by the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Harris declined to answer the question. On paper, Harris is the most junior Democrat on the Judiciary Committee. But no one inside or outside the hearing room will view the Democratic vice presidential nominee that way when it's her turn to question President Trump's court nominee. When Harris' fellow Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee were asked whether they expect her to take a leading role in a confirmation battle, which will possibly be nastier and more pivotal than Kavanaugh's, they responded with a sense of ambivalence. \"She's a little busy right now,\" Hawaii Sen. Mazie Hirono told NPR. \"There are going to be a lot of us playing the committee role.\" The answers had a lot to do with the fact that Democrats see the impending presidential election as a make-or-break moment for democracy itself and the most consequential race they've faced in generations, if ever. \"I just want Joe [Biden] and Kamala to get elected,\" Hirono said. \"That should be their focus right now, in my view. I'm pretty sure she shares my perspective on the next nominee.\" But this view also has to do with the fact that Harris, as the party's vice presidential nominee just a few weeks before the election, faces a much different set of political circumstances than she did at previous high-profile hearings. Take the 2018 Kavanaugh hearing. Harris was still relatively new to the political scene and weighing a possible presidential campaign. Grilling Kavanaugh on topics like abortion, and whether he had improperly discussed the ongoing Mueller investigation with President Trump's personal attorney, helped her score points with progressives and Democratic partisans online and in popular culture, just months before the primary campaign began. Two years later, she'll represent not just herself, but Biden and his possible presidential administration, in the hearing room. (Despite Harris' non-answer on Capitol Hill this week, a Biden campaign official told NPR she does plan to participate in the eventual hearing.) Biden has decried Republicans' decision to push ahead with a vote on a pivotal Supreme Court seat in the final days before a presidential election, and he repeatedly warns that the new justice could throw out the Affordable Care Act, which will once again be on the Supreme Court docket in November. But a large part of Biden's argument to voters, especially the more moderate voters his campaign sees as key to an electoral victory, centers on the idea of returning to normalcy and a sense of decency in politics. Lines of partisan questioning and a prosecutorial grilling of a potential Supreme Court justice might not fit with that message, especially in a moment when millions of people will already be casting early ballots. \"There'll be a lot of eyes on her and how she approaches this, both tonally and substantively,\" said David Axelrod, who was the top strategist on Barack Obama's campaign in 2008 and now works as a contributor to CNN. Axelrod faced similar tactical choices in the final weeks of that election, when a global economic meltdown briefly forced Obama off the campaign trail and back to the Senate, to vote on \u2013 and at moments, help Democrats negotiate \u2013 emergency legislation aimed at propping up the failing economy. Axelrod said Harris and the Biden campaign face some challenging dynamics here: most notably, the fact that Republicans likely have the votes they need to approve their nominee. He ventured that one approach Harris might take is sticking to broader themes, like whether the seat should be filled so quickly and so close to an election, rather than grilling the nominee about her views on polarizing issues like abortion. \"I think the thing that makes this different is, does she do it within the strategy of the campaign? Because it's very clear the focus of Biden is on the issue of health care and the Affordable Care Act,\" Axelrod said. The confirmation hearing will be a major focus of the news in the final weeks of the campaign. Though, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker points out that no matter what she focuses on that day, Harris has another big platform right now. \"I don't know if you can divide a person in that way,\" he said in response to a question about whether Harris should spend more time on Capitol Hill and less on the campaign trail during the confirmation fight. \"She is a United States senator who is a candidate for vice president. And she will bring all of her voiced experience, and really her brilliance, to the arguments we're making, no matter what role she's in,\" Booker said.",

            "article_content": "The vacancy on the Supreme Court by the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is expected to lead to a fight over abortion rights. Five justices lean conservative compared to three liberal justices.  NOEL KING, HOST: All right - now moving on to abortion rights. The Supreme Court now has three liberal justices and five conservative. President Trump would like to make that six. Anti-abortion advocates have been eager to bring a case to the court that would overturn the Roe v. Wade decision which legalized abortion nationwide in 1973. NPR's Sarah McCammon has been covering this issue in depth. Good morning, Sarah. SARAH MCCAMMON, BYLINE: Hi, Noel. KING: What are abortion rights opponents saying right now? MCCAMMON: Well, they say this is the moment they've been working toward for decades, since the Roe v. Wade decision legalized abortion nationwide in 1973. Here's Kristan Hawkins with Students for Life of America. KRISTAN HAWKINS: We've known for some time that when the next Supreme Court vacancy would be announced, that this would be the moment that we have been waiting for, for that opportunity to take America into a post-Roe nation. MCCAMMON: And, of course, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg had been a reliable vote for abortion rights. And replacing her with a conservative justice, as Trump has promised to do, really changes the game. KING: Yes, it does. So how are abortion rights advocates getting ready? MCCAMMON: They recognize this will be a contentious nomination fight. We certainly saw that with the confirmation process for Justice Brett Kavanaugh, and there is even more at stake now. Supporters of abortion rights are trying to make the case that Republicans should exhibit some consistency and refuse to confirm a justice this close to an election. As you know, of course, Noel, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell refused to hold hearings four years ago for President Obama's nominee, Judge Merrick Garland, after Justice Antonin Scalia died eight months before the election. This election is just about six weeks away, but McConnell is, of course, pushing forward. So abortion rights advocates, like NARAL's Ilyse Hogue, are asking Republicans to honor the standard they articulated four years ago. ILYSE HOGUE: We had so many Republicans in 2016 swear that they would not do this. I think the character and soul of the Republican Party is on the table right now, and I think they're going to hear a lot from voters who want them to come down on the side of letting the people decide. MCCAMMON: And NARAL and other groups say they're reaching out to voters in key states, trying to put pressure on vulnerable Republican senators to hold off on this confirmation process. KING: So we don't obviously know what's going to happen with the vacant seat, but how likely, Sarah, is it that the Supreme Court could be faced with a decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, like, anytime soon? MCCAMMON: Well, there are many ways that this issue could come before the court again. Reproductive rights groups tell me they're watching more than 15 cases related to abortion which are at the appellate court level right now and could come before the Supreme Court in the coming months or years. Just one example of those - a Mississippi state law banning abortions after 15 weeks. So far, that one has been blocked by lower courts, but the state of Mississippi has asked the Supreme Court to consider it. There are many other cases at stake. And, of course, the outcome of the Affordable Care Act, as we were just hearing, that has implications for reproductive health and reproductive rights. Longer-term anti-abortion rights groups tell me their goal is to erode Roe to such an extent that states can expect very restrictive abortion laws to be upheld, laws that would not have passed muster before. Think of some of those early first-trimester abortion bans that were passed in the past couple of years. Those groups also would like to see federal legislation prohibiting abortion. And remember, Chief Justice Roberts has been considered the swing vote on this issue recently, but if President Trump succeeds in getting another nominee on the court, abortion rights opponents might not even need Roberts to vote their way in order to dramatically restrict abortion rights. KING: Oh, that's interesting. NPR's Sarah McCammon covers abortion rights. Sarah, thanks so much. MCCAMMON: Thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2020 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Without Ginsburg's reliable liberal vote and her consistent voice for reproductive rights, Renee-Lauren Ellis has similar fears about the future of the Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion nationwide in 1973. Ellis, who's also a lawyer in the D.C. area, said she's afraid of what she sees as the potential to go backward. \"It's dire that something as fundamental as what I do with my body is up for debate still, in 2020,\" Ellis said. Ginsburg's death sets up a divisive nomination fight in the midst of a presidential campaign. And advocates on opposing sides of the issue agree that it could be a turning point in the long-running debate over one of the most divisive issues for the court: abortion rights. For those opposed to abortion rights, a Supreme Court vacancy just weeks before a presidential election also marks a pivot point. Kristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life of America, said she hopes to soon see the culmination of a movement that began decades ago. \"Our ultimate goal, and we've been very clear with this, is an America without abortion, where abortion is made illegal and unthinkable,\" Hawkins said. Marjorie Dannenfelser is president of the Susan B. Anthony List, which opposes abortion rights and has spent years working to elect Republican senators and confirm conservative judges. The group, which has staunchly supported Trump and his judicial nominees, advocates a variety of restrictions on abortion, including banning the procedure at 20 weeks or earlier and for reasons such as the sex, race, or disability of the fetus. Dannenfelser said she hopes a more conservative court would roll back the Roe decision, setting the stage for state legislatures to ban abortion as early as the first trimester. \"If abortion is the taking of a human life, the more ambitious they are the better,\" she said. Dannenfelser said she and her family happened to be sitting outside the Supreme Court on Friday evening when they heard the news of Ginsburg's death. \"It was such a sense of profound meaning that we felt in her passing, and also a moment of change,\" she said. \"That in this place that we're sitting will be the pivot point of change in our country.\" Planned Parenthood Action Fund President Alexis McGill Johnson agrees there's a lot at stake. \"The fate of our rights, our freedoms, our health care, our bodies, our lives, our country, literally depends on what happens over the coming months,\" McGill Johnson said. Groups that support abortion rights, including Planned Parenthood and NARAL, say they'll be working to apply pressure to potentially vulnerable Republican senators facing reelection now or in 2022, demanding they wait to confirm a replacement for Ginsburg until after the November election. McGill Johnson notes that four years ago, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., famously refused to hold hearings to consider President Obama's nominee to replace Justice Antonin Scalia. At that time, the presidential election was more than eight months away, and McConnell argued it was too close. Now, with the election about six weeks away, McConnell is promising to work quickly to confirm a Trump nominee. \"Mitch McConnell keeps making up the rules to suit his desires and his will to maintain power,\" McGill Johnson said. \"In a democracy, it's really important that we all play by the same rules.\" Abortion rights advocates are closely watching more than a dozen cases that are working their way through the court system and could reach the Supreme Court in the near future \u2013 as well as a challenge to the Affordable Care Act, which could have significant implications for reproductive healthcare.

This summer, supporters of abortion rights won a surprising victory when the court struck down a Louisiana law that could have had the effect of shutting down most abortion clinics in the state. Chief Justice John Roberts cast the swing vote in that decision, siding with the majority. The opinion was in line with a 2016 ruling that struck down a similar Texas law requiring doctors who perform abortions to have hospital admitting privileges. In that case, Roberts had dissented. But in the Louisiana case, Roberts said he wanted to uphold the court's earlier precedent. Michele Goodwin, a law professor at the University of California, Irvine, said such a result would be far more difficult with another Trump nominee on the court. \"That would swing the court in such a way that for at least the next two generations that it would mean hostility to reproductive rights,\" Goodwin said.",

            "article_content": "In her final statement, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said she wishes she is not replaced until after the election. NPR talks about how Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell might navigate the vacancy.  AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: We return to our top story today. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died of cancer. She was 87 years old. And as the leading liberal dissenter on a conservative court, her death will open a political fight. In Ginsburg's final statement, she said that her most fervent wish is that she is not replaced until a new president is installed. But Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has announced the Senate will vote to fill the Supreme Court vacancy she leaves behind. NPR's congressional correspondent Susan Davis is here with the latest. Susan, can you talk more about the statement from Mitch McConnell? SUSAN DAVIS, BYLINE: Well, Mitch McConnell made clear this evening that what he's been saying for the last two years is still true. If there was a vacancy before the election, he would move to fill it. His office - just maybe less than two hours since the news of her death, he put out a statement saying that, quote, \"the Senate would move forward with President Trump's nominee.\" He did not offer timing on that matter, but it seems likely that he would try to move it before the election. And he's already receiving some rhetorical support from Republican senators like Martha McSally of Arizona, herself up for a tough reelection bid this year. CORNISH: Democrats - what are they saying so far? DAVIS: Well, Senate minority leader - Chuck Schumer, who's the top Democrat in the Senate, put out a statement essentially quoting Mitch McConnell from back in 2016, when he said that he did not believe that they - the Senate should vote to fill a nominee before the election. That was the rationale that McConnell used to hold up President Obama's nominee of Merrick Garland to fill the seat of former Justice Antonin Scalia. Clearly, McConnell not going to pay any mind to that, but it also does suggest that this is going to be a stark partisan battle on Capitol Hill, Senate Democrats overwhelmingly this evening coming out in opposition to any movement on a Supreme Court nomination before the election. CORNISH: And yet, as you said, Mitch McConnell says he would like to hold a vote. We're 46 days from Election Day. Is it even possible to do something as enormous as a Supreme Court nominee process in this time? DAVIS: It's possible, but it's going to be really tough. The average time it takes to a nomination - not just a vacancy but a nomination by a president to confirmation - is generally about 67 to 70 days. As you noted, it's 46 days before the election. Normally to get something - a nomination, especially a potentially controversial nomination through the Senate, you're going to need to take more time than that. Republicans are going to need to be unified here to have a chance for this to happen. I think it's safe to assume they're not going to get any Democratic support on this. So it's going to turn really quickly to these vulnerable senators and what they are going to do. Are they going to line up behind Mitch McConnell? - thinking of senators like Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia - particularly the women in the Senate and women in the Senate who have supported abortion rights in the past. Remember. The vacancy on this court for Ruth Bader Ginsburg is very quickly and likely to become a question about the future of Roe v. Wade in this country, especially if this is a vacancy that could tip the ideological balance of the court to conservatives. CORNISH: Has anyone heard from any of those senators you mentioned? DAVIS: Well, Lisa Murkowski has said previously that she would - believes that they should not vote until after inauguration. Susan Collins has, in the past, indicated the same thing. Where they go now, though, when it's not just theoretical, when it's real, remains to be seen. Most of the responses from these senators in question tonight have just been condolences and grieving. Very quickly, they're going to need to say whether they will support moving forward with this process because it's going to have to happen very soon. CORNISH: That's NPR congressional correspondent Susan Davis. Thank you. DAVIS: You're welcome. Copyright \u00a9 2020 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "When it comes to the presidential election, Arizona is considered a toss-up state with Biden slightly ahead in many polls. We hear from voters.  RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: This week, we have been hearing from voters in battleground states across the country ahead of the November election. And this morning, Jimmy Jenkins from member station KJZZ in Phoenix is taking us to Arizona. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) JIMMY JENKINS, BYLINE: We are in downtown Phoenix. It is 110 degrees at the farmer's market, but there are free samples of kale chips. Despite the heat, the open-air market has attracted a diverse crowd that's willing to chat politics while perusing the produce. Robin Meservey from north Phoenix is looking over piles of hot peppers and big, red heirloom tomatoes. She says the recent political conventions didn't really have much of an impact on her. And she's still undecided on who to support. ROBIN MESERVEY: I really don't know who I'm going to vote for for president. I don't think we have very good options at all. JENKINS: Meservey says she leans liberal on certain issues, like the environment, but she's also an abortion rights opponent. So she feels torn between the two parties. She says if the vote was today, she'd probably go with Trump. MESERVEY: Which I thought I would never say (laughter) that I would do. But I might actually vote for him because he's kind of the devil you know as opposed to maybe the devil you don't know as a president. JENKINS: Over by the artisan bread stand, Kevin Wood says he's made up his mind. KEVIN WOOD: I'm an independent, but this year, it's a clear choice. Got to go one way. So we're going to go the Biden way. JENKINS: Wood says the unifying messaging and stable temperament coming from Biden and the Democrats resonates with him. But despite his confidence in Biden, he's unsure about the election. WOOD: I'm nervous to see the administration already assaulting and eroding confidence in mail-in voting. You know, that just kind of has my stomach churning. JENKINS: Like more than 80% of Arizonans, Wood votes by mail. Most of the people I talked to at the market were aware of President Trump casting doubt on mail-in voting but said it hadn't shaken their faith in the system. But that's not true for all Arizonans. LUIS AVILA: We know that people are afraid and that, you know, these messages are kind of, like, being distributed. JENKINS: Political organizer Luis Avila says the attacks are confusing Latino voters. AVILA: Even though we've gained so much trust from community members to actually partake in the process of voting by mail, we are seeing a regression, in some ways, in some of that confidence. And that's concerning. JENKINS: Avila says while most Latino voters in Arizona have made up their mind, there is still a significant portion who are undecided. AVILA: We're not hearing people, you know, fired up about Biden. But we're hearing people who are really, really concerned about having four more years for the Republican Party. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Two, three... UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE: Freedom. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: So we are here to defend our freedom. JENKINS: But four more years is exactly what Trump's base of voters in Arizona is hoping for. About a hundred people are at the state capital on Labor Day, protesting restrictions put in place on businesses in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Ralph Ruggiero is flying the American flag, a Don't Tread on Me flag, and he's got a hand-painted sign that says... RALPH RUGGIERO: Liberty or death. JENKINS: After seeing protests and looting taking place across the country, Ruggiero thinks we need a leader who isn't afraid to take charge. RUGGIERO: He's my law-and-order president. That's who he is. And the other ones are for chaos and no order. JENKINS: While Ruggiero says a Biden presidency would threaten the country, Paul Ollarsaba, Jr. doesn't think the stakes are quite that high. He was raised a Democrat but now supports Trump. PAUL OLLARSABA, JR: We have people who have different values fighting for different things. And I believe that either way it goes, we'll adapt as a country and keep on rolling. JENKINS: The latest polling has Biden up just a few points over Trump in Arizona but still within the margin of error. The campaigns don't have much time left to try and sway Arizona's remaining undecided voters. Early ballots will be mailed out October 7. For NPR News, I'm Jimmy Jenkins in Phoenix.

President Trump has released an additional 20 names he would select from if any Supreme Court vacancies arise during his remaining time in office, including the president's rival-turned-Senate ally, Ted Cruz. The list also includes Sens. Tom Cotton and Josh Hawley as well as two former U.S. solicitors general. The president's running list, which he first compiled in 2016, already included more than a dozen conservative legal minds from across the country. With Wednesday's additions, he adds bulk to the number of justices he would choose from to bolster the court's conservative majority. \"Over the next four years, the next president will choose hundreds of federal judges and one, two, three, four Supreme Court justices,\" Trump said during a Wednesday press conference at the White House. He described a bleak picture if \"radical left judges\" were nominated under Democratic rival Joe Biden. Trump's updated list, which includes several women and people of color, reflects the emphasis the Republican Party has to pay in its attempt to court voters more broadly outside of white, often older, reliably conservative circles. The Wednesday list includes Daniel Cameron, the Black, conservative Kentucky attorney general who has faced criticism over his handling of the police shooting death of Breonna Taylor, which sparked nationwide protests against police brutality. Supreme Court nominations are among the most consequential and long-lasting decisions a president can make. Justices to the highest court in the land have a lifetime appointment and are the final say in controversial decisions such as abortion rights, same-sex marriage and civilian gun ownership. In a tweet following Trump's announcement, Hawley, one of a handful of sitting U.S. senators the president said he would choose from if the time came, declined the president's endorsement to the court. \"I appreciate the President's confidence in listing me as a potential Supreme Court nominee. But as I told the President, Missourians elected me to fight for them in the Senate, and I have no interest in the high court. I look forward to confirming constitutional conservatives,\" Hawley wrote. The full list of Trump's additional picks is as follows: Bridget Bade of Arizona, judge on the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of AppealsDaniel Cameron of Kentucky, that state's attorney generalPaul Clement of Virginia, former U.S. solicitor general Sen.

            "article_content": "President Trump traveled to Latrobe, Pa. to rev up his supporters in a large rally. It's become a central part of Trump's electoral strategy this year but his strategy carries a lot of risk.  RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: Although polls have narrowed recently, they do show that President Trump is trailing former Vice President Joe Biden nationally. And notably, he is trailing him in most key swing states. But rather than trying to win over skeptics, the president spent last night talking to his base in a big rally in Latrobe, Pa. NPR's Scott Detrow spent the day in Latrobe and is with us now. Hey, Scott. SCOTT DETROW, BYLINE: Good morning. MARTIN: What was the scene like? What was turnout like? What was the rally like? DETROW: You know, it felt like a pre-pandemic scene - a huge overflow crowd, I should say, minimal, if any, COVID precautions. The president was in a good mood, happy to be there. It really felt to me like the rallies that were a hallmark of Trump's campaign in 2016. But I went to a lot of them then. And to me, this crowd seemed even more intense about the president, more devoted to him than what I saw four years ago. MARTIN: But does that tell us how much support he actually has in Latrobe? DETROW: This is a place where he beat Hillary Clinton by more than 30 points. He has deep, deep support here. And that just stood out to me when I drove around town in the pouring rain seeing how many Trump signs were all over the place. Trump 2020. Trump/Pence. There's a sign that says pro-life, pro-Trump. And dwarfing all those signs, the red, white and blue Trump house. AMY TAYLOR: First off, outside, there's what? A 100-foot tall Trump... DETROW: (Laughter). TAYLOR: ...You know, statuette outside, which is really cool. A lot of people can get their picture taken next to it. There's Biden in the basement. DETROW: It's become a kind of pilgrimage for Trump supporters like Amy Taylor (ph), who's visiting it despite the pouring rain before heading to the rally. The cut-out of Trump does seem huge. But really, it's only about two stories tall. Like many people here, Taylor says her support for the president has only grown since 2016. She says she got it from her parents. TAYLOR: They're all about the Trump. And they raised me kind of, like, to, you know, follow in their footsteps. And they're just, like - they taught me the ways of Trump and the ways the Republican Party has done good for America. DETROW: The rain lets up, which gives the parking lot outside the rally a tailgate feel. UNIDENTIFIED CROWD: (Singing) Happy birthday to you. DETROW: Mike and Sarah Sever (ph) are set up with a tent, coolers full of beer, lawn chairs and flags. MIKE SEVER: Basically, he kept all his promises... SARAH SEVER: Yeah. Promises made, promises kept. M SEVER: ...Amongst so much resistance from the Democrats, which I firmly believe hate this country. S SEVER: They do. DETROW: Here, Biden is a villain, a puppet of the left. Trump is a hero even when his trade policies sometimes hurt dairy farmers, like Mike. M SEVER: We'll do our part. We'll do our part when it comes down to it. DETROW: Trump has spent the bulk of his presidency catering mostly to the core of the base, the voters who never leave his side. That's led to approval ratings that have only rarely even come close to 50% and almost half of the electorate telling pollsters there's no way they'd ever consider voting for the president this fall. Still, Trump sees his base in places like Latrobe as the way to win a second term. His campaign thinks they can get even more core supporters to show up than 2016. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I think we're way ahead of what we were four years ago. And there's far more enthusiasm. Our base is bigger. It's stronger. DETROW: The approach has a lot of risks - among them, the fact that this base is relatively limited. MIKE MIKUS: Look; if I'm him, I'm not going to Latrobe, you know? I'm going to suburban Pittsburgh. I mean, Latrobe's Westmoreland County, which is a - has been for 30 years (laughter) a bright-red county. DETROW: Mike Mikus is a western Pennsylvania Democratic strategist. He points out Trump's big problem, in Pennsylvania and elsewhere, is cratering popularity in the suburbs. A lot of last week's Republican convention was meant to win some of those one-time supporters back. Last night, though, Trump was back to playing the hits for the base - among other things, making fun of Biden for wearing a mask. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: Did you ever see a man that likes a mask as much as him? (LAUGHTER) TRUMP: And then, he makes a speech. And he always has it - not always, but a lot of times, he has it hanging down. DETROW: Trump minimized the pandemic and blamed Democratic governors for overly cautious approaches. He has a sympathetic audience in Sara Sever. S SEVER: Like, I'm not OK with that. I mean, I'm anti-mask totally. Like, I am not scared of a virus. DETROW: Several people at the rally falsely suggest the virus is man-made or that scientists are holding back a vaccine, that it's all part of an attempt to undercut the president. Even among the Trump supporters in Latrobe who don't think this, there's still an overwhelming sense the president has done a good job on the coronavirus. That includes Amy Taylor, who tells me back at the Trump house that she'd lost her job as an aerobics instructor because of the pandemic and is still unemployed. TAYLOR: First off, has there ever been a pandemic to take over the world like this in such a short period of time? I think that Trump did the best that he could, considering the circumstances. DETROW: Inside the bubble of the Trump rally in a Trump city, he's handled the pandemic well. Among voters as a whole, masks have broad support. But Trump has gotten increasingly negative reviews as the U.S. death toll approaches 200,000 and millions remain unemployed. Trump is betting that first narrative is what wins out in two months. MARTIN: That's NPR's Scott Detrow reporting from Latrobe. Scott is still on the line with us. I want to ask about a report out in The Atlantic magazine, which portrays the president as someone who, for years, has said very disparaging things about the U.S. military. Can you tell us more about what's in there and now how the White House is responding? DETROW: This is a story that said that the president just fundamentally doesn't understand the sacrifices these soldiers make and walk through several moments where these sources said he criticized or blamed soldiers who died in war, question The point of even fighting in one. He allegedly, at one point, said a cemetery filled with the dead from World War I was, quote, \"filled with losers.\" As you mentioned, the president has forcefully denied this. He spoke to reporters at the end of this trip and said, quote, \"I would be willing to swear on anything that I never said that about our fallen heroes.\" But remember, he made similar comments about John McCain being shot down at the very beginning of his presidential campaign back in 2015. MARTIN: NPR's Scott Detrow in Latrobe, Pa. Scott, thanks very much. DETROW: Thanks. Copyright \u00a9 2020 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "The U.S. Supreme Court agreed Thursday to hear arguments this fall in a case that pits the Trump administration against the House Judiciary Committee and its efforts to see redacted portions of report on Russian interference prepared by special prosecutor Robert Mueller. The decision is a significant blow to House Democrats' efforts to see the material before the November election. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia had ruled that the House Judiciary Committee was entitled to see usually secret grand jury material that was redacted by the Trump Justice Department from the Mueller report on the 2016 election when it was handed over to the committee. At the request of the Justice Department, the high court temporarily blocked the lower court order from going into effect. And now the court has agreed to hear the case this fall, with a decision almost certain to come after the election. The House went to court a year ago to get the grand jury material, well before the formal beginning of impeachment proceedings related to allegations that President Trump held up aid to Ukraine for political reasons. More recently, House lawyer Douglas Letter told the justices that the inquiry did not end with the president's impeachment by the House and his acquittal by the Senate in February. The Trump administration, however, maintains that the investigation ended with the acquittal and that the House thus has no need for the material. In a statement, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., expressed disappointment in the Supreme Court's decision to allow Trump and Attorney General William Barr to \"run out the clock on all accountability.\" \"In every administration before this one,\" Nadler observed, the Department of Justice \"has cooperated with the Judiciary Committee's requests for grand jury materials relating to investigations of impeachable offenses.\" Trump and Barr, he said, \"broke from that practice.\" \"While I am confident their legal arguments will fail,\" he concluded, \"it is now all the more important for the American people to hold the president accountable at the ballot box in November.\" Other controversial cases The court's action was one of several on Thursday that essentially kick the can down the road in cases involving controversial subjects. Just days after striking down a Louisiana abortion law, the court declined to take up an Indiana law, signed by then-Gov. Mike Pence, that imposes a variety of restrictions on abortion, including requiring an ultrasound test and an 18-hour waiting period before an abortion. The 7th Circuit Court of Appeals blocked the restrictions from going into effect, but the justices ordered the lower court judges to reconsider their decision in light of the Supreme Court's abortion decision earlier this week. The court could have simply turned aside the Indiana case, so the order suggests that Chief Justice John Roberts, who this week cast the decisive fifth vote to invalidate a Louisiana abortion law, may well be prepared to accept other kinds of restrictions, as he seemed to suggest in his solo opinion on Monday. Lastly, on Thursday, the Supreme Court refused to expedite a petition that would have allowed the justices to hear arguments and rule prior to the November election on a petition from the Texas Democratic Party and Texas voters who want all registered voters in the state to be able to vote by mail. A  federal district court judge in Texas had ordered the state to allow the mail-in ballots for all eligible voters, but that judgment was overruled by the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals.  The justices' refusal to consider speeding up their review process means that even if they decide to review the 5th Circuit ruling in the fall, it almost certainly won't be in time for the 2020 election cycle.",

Cawthorn will face Democrat Moe Davis in November. In a surprising upset, a 24-year-old political newcomer on Tuesday defeated President Trump's pick in a Republican primary runoff for a western North Carolina congressional seat vacated by Trump's chief of staff. Madison Cawthorn, a real estate investor, easily beat out Lynda Bennett, a real estate agent who had a clear fundraising advantage, with about 66% of the vote. Loading... Trump's chief of staff, Mark Meadows, announced he wouldn't seek reelection right before the filing deadline, and Bennett quickly announced her intent to run \u2014 a move that angered many Republicans in the 11th Congressional District. Bennett, 62, lost the runoff despite a string of high-profile GOP endorsements, including from Trump, who recorded a robocall for her; Meadows; Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas; and Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio. Cawthorn used those endorsements against her, labeling her as the establishment choice who would be beholden to special interests. He also criticized Bennett for refusing to debate him, saying in an ad, \"I'll debate anytime, anywhere. I won't cow behind big-name endorsements.\" Following his win, Cawthorn released a statement appealing to Trump. \"I want to make something clear; I support our great president,\" he said. \"I do not believe this election has been a referendum on the president's influence. The people of western North Carolina are wise and discerning. You observed both candidates and simply made the choice you believed is best for our district. I look forward to fighting alongside our president after I'm elected in November.\" Cawthorn campaigned as \"pro-Trump, pro-life and pro-Second Amendment\" and emphasized his family's deep roots in the state, which he said goes back to the Revolutionary War. \"I'm a millennial. I represent an emerging generation of Americans who are tomorrow's leaders, most of whom think that Republicans don't care about the disenfranchised, the hurting and those less fortunate. But nothing could be farther from the truth,\" Cawthorn said in a campaign video. Cawthorn was nominated by Meadows in 2014 to attend the U.S. Naval Academy but suffered major injuries in a car accident later that year, leaving him paralyzed from the waist down. Cawthorn will be 25 by November's general election \u2014 the minimum age for a U.S. representative. In an interview with the Washington Examiner, Cawthorn shrugged off suggestions from opponents that he's too young to handle working in the halls of Washington. \"If they want to push me or do whatever they can, I promise I will fight back because I have been through far worse than they could ever imagine,\" he said. \"The people of western North Carolina are the only people I care about. I really think that my accident has given me the resolve to represent them.\" He also told the Examiner his accident gave him insight into the health care system, which he has placed as a top priority. \"I had over $3 million in medical debt as an 18-year-old,\" he said. \"I would like to be the face of the Republican Party when it comes to health care.\" Bennett took first place in the March 3 primary but didn't win by a large enough margin to avoid a runoff. Cawthorn placed second in the primary, beating out a former Meadows staffer and a state senator. In November's general election, Cawthorn will face Democratic nominee Moe Davis, a former prosecutor and retired Air Force colonel. The 11th District is considered a safe Republican district by political forecasters.",

Charles Booker, pictured, faces Amy McGrath in Kentucky's Democratic primary for the U.S. Senate. Progressives are mounting efforts to best establishment Democrats in Kentucky and New York Tuesday. Black Lives Matter protests around the country have added energy to the left, and Black progressives are surging in contests in both states. In Kentucky, the race between the two leading Democrats vying for the right to likely take on Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is coming down to the wire. All the momentum is on the side of state Rep. Charles Booker over Amy McGrath, a retired Marine fighter pilot with a lot of money and the party's backing. In New York, a former principal from the Bronx is taking aim at a 30-year-incumbent, Rep. Eliot Engel. Engel hasn't faced a competitive primary in 20 years, and the pressure is showing. In all Tuesday, voters in five states head to the polls, including North Carolina, Virginia and Mississippi, in addition to Kentucky and New York. Here's a look at some of the notable races to watch: Senate (Democratic) \u2014 McGrath vs. Booker The death of Breonna Taylor in Louisville has changed the trajectory of this race. Booker has all the momentum after attending and taking a leadership role at protests over her death. He's become something of a progressive cause  c\u00e9l\u00e8bre, as Sen. Bernie Sanders, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Sen. Elizabeth Warren and former Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes have all endorsed Booker. And a poll out Thursday showed Booker ahead of McGrath. It's a stunning turn of events, because McGrath has brought in almost $41 million \u2014 more than McConnell has raised. McGrath also has the backing of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. McGrath burst on the scene in 2018 with an ad for a House seat that highlighted her career as a fighter pilot. But her loss during that Democratic wave year took some of the shine off, and Democrats privately criticized the campaign she ran. And Booker is out with a powerful new video that encapsulates a lot of the economic and political messages Democrats are pushing nationally. Either Booker or McGrath would start in a hole against McConnell, as polls show both down double-digits against him. Loading... 4th Congressional District (Republican) \u2014 Massie vs. McMurtry Is the race between incumbent Rep. Thomas Massie and lawyer Todd McMurtry is coming down to... who's more racist? McMurtry, who is a lawyer for one of the students from Covington Catholic High School that had a standoff with an Indigenous activist, landed in hot water after racist tweets of his surfaced. McMurtry then accused Massie of displaying the Confederate battle flag at his home. Things get more complicated and tie in GOP leadership. Massie upset President Trump and Republican leadership by forcing members back to Washington to vote on a coronavirus relief bill. As a result, House No. 3 Liz Cheney and others donated to McMurtry. But that was before the tweets came out. When that happened, Cheney and other Republicans demanded their money back, which drew ridicule from Massie. Loading... 16th Congressional District (Democratic) \u2014 Engel vs. Bowman New York is the site of several key Democratic primary races Tuesday, as many longtime politicians \u2014 including Reps. Jerry Nadler, Yvette Clarke and Carolyn Maloney \u2014 face a wave of more progressive challengers. Engel, who has held his congressional seat since 1988, faces perhaps the toughest race, against former middle school principal and education advocate Jamaal Bowman. While Engel has been endorsed by Hillary Clinton, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Bowman has gained increased support from progressive leaders, like Sanders, Warren and New York's Ocasio-Cortez, who in 2018 herself defeated a longtime Democratic incumbent close to party leadership. In a poll released last week by the left-leaning group Data for Progress, Bowman led Engel by 10 points. Loading... Additional New York races to watch (full results here): 11th Congressional District (Republican) \u2014 Bennett vs. Cawthorn This GOP primary runoff is to fill the seat of former Rep. Mark Meadows, who resigned in March to be Trump's chief of staff. The two candidates running are real estate agent Lynda Bennett and real estate investor Madison Cawthorn. Bennett has been endorsed by Trump, Meadows and Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, but some Republican voters in the 11th district have expressed doubt and skepticism over controversial campaign choices. The GOP winner will go on to face Democratic nominee Moe Davis, a retired Air Force colonel and former prosecutor. Loading... 2nd Congressional District (Republican) \u2014 Luria vs. Taylor... Round 2? Former Rep. Scott Taylor is vying for a rematch against freshman Democratic Rep. Elaine Luria, who defeated Taylor in 2018 by just over 2 percentage points. Taylor, who had only served one term, faced an election fraud scandal during his reelection campaign after a staffer forged signatures to try to get a third-party candidate on the ballot. Two years later, Taylor says Luria's decision to support Trump's impeachment was \"the last straw\" in prompting him to run. Taylor is the only candidate with prior political experience running for the GOP nomination, and he leads the primary field in fundraising. Loading... 2nd Congressional District (Republican) \u2014 Carey vs. Flowers In a runoff election, Republicans Thomas Carey and Brian Flowers will compete for the GOP nomination in this heavily Democratic district. The winner will go on to face Democrat Bennie Thompson, who has held the seat for 27 years. Hillary Clinton won this majority African American district by almost 30 points. Loading...",

Updated at 9:05 a.m. ET Sunday In his first big campaign event since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic in the United States, President Trump reached back into his culture war playbook to paint an image of a left-wing extremist dystopia that will take hold if he is defeated and Democratic opponent Joe Biden is elected this November. \"If the Democrats gain power, then the rioters will be in charge and no one will be safe and no one will have control,\" Trump said to a crowd, which numbered in the thousands but failed to fill an arena in Tulsa, Okla., on Saturday night and was far smaller than Trump's campaign promised. \"Joe Biden is not the leader of his party. Joe Biden is a helpless puppet of the radical left.\" But then Trump seemed to undercut that message, saying of Biden, \"He's not radical left\" and that \"he was never radical left. But now he's controlled by the radical left.\" That highlights a problem that Trump and his campaign have recognized since before the Democratic primary. It would have been much easier to tie many of Biden's more progressive primary opponents to more extreme positions, because Biden has disavowed many of them. He has had to stand on debate stages and argue from the center-left when the energy, enthusiasm and loudest voices within the party were against him. Amid Trump's handling of the coronavirus pandemic and the Black Lives Matter protests that have swept the country in the wake of the killing of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police, the incumbent president's political standing has suffered. His campaign hoped the Tulsa event would provide a morale boost. It billed that a million people had signed up for tickets, and it built a second stage outside for an overflow crowd. The president and vice president were scheduled to give two speeches \u2014 one outside, one in. But the overflow crowd never materialized, and the outdoor festivities were called off. About 120,000 Americans have died from COVID-19 on Trump's watch, and he is seen by voters as fanning the flames of racial tensions in the wake of Floyd's death. On Saturday night, the president defended his handling of the coronavirus pandemic, claiming to have saved \"millions.\" \"We saved millions of lives. Now it's time, get back to work,\" Trump said to a tightly packed crowd, most of whom were not wearing masks. Trump made the claim despite downplaying the threat posed by the coronavirus for months and despite evidence that cases are spiking in many parts of the country, such as Florida, Texas and, yes, Oklahoma. At one point, Trump said he told his administration to \"slow the testing down\" for the coronavirus. \"When you do testing to that extent, you are gonna find more people, you're gonna find more cases,\" Trump said. \"So I said to my people, 'Slow the testing down, please.' They test, and they test. We have tests that people don't know what's going on.\" A White House official said that Trump was joking and that the administration is \"proud\" of the level of testing it has done, according to a Wall Street Journal reporter. Yet Trump has repeatedly said he thinks high levels of testing make the U.S. look bad, because it shows more cases than if less testing were done. Democrats have seized on the comment. The Biden campaign released a statement after the rally, saying that in \"an outrageous moment that will be remembered long after tonight's debacle of a rally, President Trump just admitted that he's putting politics ahead of the safety and economic well-being of the American people.\" Biden also tweeted, \"Speed up the testing,\" about an hour after the rally ended. Speed up the testing. By Sunday morning, a Democratic group had already cut an ad seizing on the moment. Trump, who at one point meandered into a long defense \u2014 and reenactment \u2014 of his gingerly walking down a ramp and drinking water during a speech at the West Point military academy, again played on racist stereotypes and nicknames. He labeled the coronavirus the \"Chinese virus\" to approving laughs from the crowd, even adding in the phrase \"kung flu.\" He created a fictional story about life under the left, referencing when a \"tough hombre\" tried to break into a house, and a woman in it, whose husband was away for work, tried to call 911 but the number was no longer working. Trump defended Confederate statues, saying the left is trying to \"desecrate our monuments.\" He pushed Congress to pass a law punishing people with a year in jail for burning the American flag, though the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the right to burn the flag under the First Amendment decades ago. He took aim at the NFL, which apologized recently for how it treated black athletes who kneeled during the national anthem to protest police brutality. Trump implored, \"Never kneel \u2014 we will stand proud and stand tall.\" He hit several culture war notes, arguing that conservative culture was under attack from the likes of Biden and making a range of false claims about late-term abortion, taking away guns and wanting to \"prosecute Americans for going to church but not burning a church.\" Trump said Democrats want to abolish bail and ICE, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. They want to dismantle police, he said, while freeing vicious MS-13 gang members, and he said that they want \"rioters\" and \"looters\" to \"have more rights than law-abiding citizens.\" Supporters of President Trump cheer as they attend a campaign rally at the BOK Center on Saturday in Tulsa, Oklahoma.\n                \n                    \n                    Evan Vucci/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Supporters of President Trump cheer as they attend a campaign rally at the BOK Center on Saturday in Tulsa, Oklahoma. \"The silent majority is stronger than ever before,\" Trump said, declaring the Republican Party \"the party of Lincoln\" and \"law and order.\" But whether that message will work again in 2020 is very much an open question. Polls have shown shifts on how Americans view protesters and the police \u2014 and Trump has done little since becoming president to reach out to independents, a group he won in 2016. His campaign was hoping that Saturday night's event, which went against the guidance of health officials, would signal the enthusiasm that the president still retains \u2014 and be a shot in the arm. But the event did not live up to its high billing. Thousands gathered inside the arena, filling the lower portion of it, with many scattered in the upper section, but it wasn't full. Not long before the event, the campaign announced that the events outside were called off. Secret Service has moved crowd back from the overflow stage so it can be broken down. pic.twitter.com/iIxXfnpOPn The campaign blamed it on protesters. \"President Trump is rallying in Tulsa with thousands of energetic supporters, a stark contrast to the sleepy campaign being run by Joe Biden from his basement in Delaware,\" campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh said in a statement. \"Sadly, protestors interfered with supporters, even blocking access to the metal detectors, which prevented people from entering the rally. Radical protestors, coupled with a relentless onslaught from the media, attempted to frighten off the President's supporters. We are proud of the thousands who stuck it out.\" There were certainly protesters, but those on scene reported largely peaceful protests. Two opposing groups coming together in downtown Tulsa pic.twitter.com/IszKMkpXnc Our @CBSNews team stood at the W Fourth St security barricade for over an hour and watched as state police & national guardsmen blocked it. Trump supporters expressed disappointment when the entrance closed, but none of them appeared shaken or intimidated by peaceful protesters. https://t.co/k12dgdIP9a It's not a good sign for a president who needed a shot in the arm as he faces slumping poll numbers. There are still four and a half months to go until Election Day, and a lot will change, but it's hard to imagine that this is what his campaign was hoping for. Trump and his campaign know that he is at a low point, and it's clearly gnawing at Trump that it was spurred by the coronavirus pandemic, which derailed the economy. He was \"riding high,\" Trump said, but that was \"before this thing [the coronavirus] came in.\"",

The group declined to back a candidate during the Democratic primaries but announced its support for Biden on Monday. Updated at 5:20 p.m. ET With abortion rights advocates on the defensive at the federal and state levels over the last four years, Planned Parenthood's advocacy arm is endorsing former Vice President Joe Biden in his race to defeat President Trump. Activists are putting their hope in Biden, whom some see as having a mixed record on abortion, as they watch a U.S. Supreme Court reshaped by Trump appointees for key decisions that could scale back access to abortion and birth control. They're also reeling from a series of policy reversals related to reproductive health during the Trump administration. \"This is literally a life and death election,\" Alexis McGill Johnson, acting president of Planned Parenthood, told NPR ahead of the announcement. \"We felt like we can't endure another four years of Trump; we have to do everything we can to get him out of office.\" In a video statement announcing the endorsement, Biden pledges his support for reproductive rights and highlights his work on the Affordable Care Act during his time as President Barack Obama's vice president. The law required participating insurers to cover reproductive health screenings and contraception without a co-pay. Planned Parenthood Action Fund, the group's advocacy and political arm, is endorsing Biden for president in 2020. \"We will protect women's constitutional right to choose, and I am proud to stand with you in this fight,\" the presumptive Democratic nominee says in the video released Monday by the group's advocacy and political arm, Planned Parenthood Action Fund. Planned Parenthood is contrasting Biden's record with that of Trump, who has won praise from abortion rights opponents for appointing conservative judges, and for blocking domestic and international organizations that provide abortions from receiving federal funds to cover other reproductive health care such as birth control and sexually transmitted infection screenings. McGill Johnson told NPR that it's urgent to reverse Trump's policies. \"I think that's where most Americans are,\" she said. \"We need to be able to kind of move past this very challenging, divisive, polarized era and move into a place where we can actually rebuild our lives after this disaster.\" In response, Jeanne Mancini, president of the anti-abortion rights group March For Life, said in a statement, \"It is offensive to hear our nation's largest abortion provider, Planned Parenthood, an organization that claims the lives of 345,672 American babies annually (a third of all of the abortions in this country each year), call the 2020 cycle a 'life and death' election. Those who really care about protecting life realize that the election of Planned Parenthood-endorsed candidate, Joe Biden, will result in a major increase of tax dollars going to the billion-dollar organization, including direct payment for abortions, among other deadly consequences.\" Planned Parenthood has endorsed the Democratic presidential candidate in every election cycle since 2004 when former U.S. Sen. John Kerry was the nominee. After endorsing Hillary Clinton in the Democratic primary four years ago, Planned Parenthood did not make a primary endorsement this year. While Biden has long supported abortion rights, he's been seen as less progressive on the issue than many other Democrats, including his former rivals for the nomination. For decades he supported the Hyde Amendment, which bans federal funds for most abortions, before reversing that position last year as he was starting his presidential campaign. At a presidential primary forum hosted by Planned Parenthood Action Fund last year in South Carolina \u2013 which did not result in an endorsement for any candidate \u2013 Planned Parenthood Action Fund Executive Director Kelley Robinson noted that Biden had \"evolved\" on some issues, including the Hyde Amendment, and asked him how he'd ensure access to abortion for low-income women. Biden addresses his record on abortion rights during a 2019 forum hosted by Planned Parenthood in South Carolina, including his past support for the Hyde Amendment, which prohibits federal funding for most abortions. Biden responded by suggesting that he'd supported the policy in the past in an effort to compromise and achieve larger goals. He said he wants to expand access to health care for low-income people, including abortion. \"It became really clear to me that, although the Hyde Amendment was designed to try to split the difference here to make sure women still had access, you can't have access if, in fact, everyone's covered by a federal policy,\" Biden said during the forum in June 2019. Asked by NPR if Biden's record on the issue could dampen enthusiasm for him this fall among the Democratic base, a broader concern for many in the party, McGill Johnson said he's shown a willingness to \"listen\" and adjust his views. \"What we know is that he's somebody that folks can work with. We know that he will deliver on basic \u2014 I mean birth control, access to abortion \u2014 these are actually bread-and-butter issues, and I think that's what we really need right now,\" McGill Johnson said. In the midst of a coronavirus pandemic, nationwide protests for racial justice and what abortion rights advocates see as relentless incursions from the Trump administration, McGill Johnson said now seemed like the right moment to announce the endorsement. In a sign of the urgency advocates are feeling around the issue, groups on both sides of the abortion debate said they're spending tens of millions of dollars this year; the anti-abortion rights group Susan B. Anthony List, which supports Trump, has announced plans to spend more than $50 million during the 2020 campaign cycle. Planned Parenthood officials said they're spending $45 million this election cycle, 50% more than four years ago.",

But with demographic change and GOP in-fighting, that control is in danger.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: Georgia is one of a handful of states holding primary elections tomorrow. Two U.S. Senate seats are up for grabs. It's a tough political moment for Republicans, who've been in power for nearly two decades in the state. The coronavirus pandemic, street protests and political infighting are not helping the party as it goes up against energized Democrats. From member station WABE in Atlanta, Emma Hurt reports. EMMA HURT, BYLINE: U.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue is visiting a produce wholesaler south of Atlanta which benefited from federal coronavirus relief. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) SONNY PERDUE: But I want to thank our congressional delegation for being here. Senator Loeffler's back here, Representative Austin Scott, Representative Doug Collins, Representative Rick Allen. HURT: It's no accident Perdue drew so many politicians to the event. He was Georgia's first Republican governor in 130 years. His 2002 election heralded a new era of Georgia politics - one ruled by Republicans. And when asked whether the pendulum has started to swing back towards Democrats, he conceded there's truth to that. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PERDUE: That's the way politics work. I think when one political party in power has it for a long time, there's a complacency that comes in. And that's why people have choices. It holds us all accountable. HURT: Still, Perdue doesn't think Georgia's going to flip this year, but he sees the parallels. So does Heath Garrett, a Republican strategist who's worked in Georgia politics for decades. He says that the state's electorate has gotten younger, more diverse and more Democratic-leaning. Meanwhile, Republicans aren't changing as quickly, just like Democrats didn't years ago. HEATH GARRETT: We also see a lot of very competitive intraparty Republican fighting trying to pull the Republican primaries farther to the right just about the same time that the general election in Georgia is moving more to the center, which creates the same conundrum for Republicans today that Democrats had 20 years ago. HURT: Two of the politicians with Sonny Perdue at that warehouse, Senator Kelly Loeffler and Congressman Doug Collins, are at the center of one of those intraparty fights for Loeffler's Senate seat. It's the last thing Georgia Republicans needed in a race that was already going to be tough. Democrats have been narrowing the margins in Georgia for years. In 2016, Donald Trump won by about five points; in 2018, Republican Governor Brian Kemp by just 1 1/2. Recent Georgia polling puts Joe Biden neck and neck with President Trump. ANDRA GILLESPIE: In general, Georgia Republicans have to just really reckon with the fact that it's not 2006 anymore... HURT: Andra Gillespie teaches political science at Emory University. GILLESPIE: ...And that they shouldn't expect to win elections in landslides and by comfortable margins. HURT: It's all compounded, she says, by this season's headlines - protests, the pandemic, President Trump's approval ratings. Charles Bullock, a political scientist at the University of Georgia, has been talking about the state's growing competitiveness for years. He's seen two main responses from Republicans - those that moderate their policies... CHARLES BULLOCK: But then for others, I would characterize them as maybe kamikazes - that yeah, they see the Democrats coming, but... HURT: They push through polarizing conservative legislation anyway, he says, like Georgia's recent anti-abortion law. Meanwhile, Georgia Democrats have been organizing. In 2018, they flipped one Republican House seat and came close to winning another. Teresa Tomlinson has been in Georgia politics for years and is running in the Democratic Senate primary. TERESA TOMLINSON: And now you see Republicans beginning to wake up and take note and wonder if the strategy they had in the can is going to pull them out this time. HURT: One Republican who says he's awake to the change is Sen. David Perdue. In audio obtained by CNN, he told activists that Georgia is in play. Still, his spokeswoman says Perdue remains confident voters will reelect him in November. For NPR News, I'm Emma Hurt in Atlanta. Copyright \u00a9 2020 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Kelly Loeffler, R-Ga., during her swearing-in by Vice President Pence (right) in January. Loeffler faces another Georgia Republican, Rep. Doug Collins, in a special election to complete her term, a divisive intraparty conflict that lays bare divisions within the Georgia GOP that could cost the party the Senate seat. Georgia's primary elections on Tuesday are pulling attention back to what's expected to be a highly challenging set of races for Republicans there, who have dominated statewide politics for nearly two decades. Buoyed by an electorate that is growing younger and more diverse, Democrats have been narrowing margins in Georgia in recent years. This fall, Democrats think they stand a chance of winning its 16 Electoral College votes, the two Senate seats on the ballot and an open U.S. House seat. It would be a dramatic reversal of fortune for Georgia Republicans. Now-U.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue's 2002 election as the state's first Republican governor in 130 years heralded a new era of Georgia politics. By 2015, the GOP controlled 10 of the state's 14 U.S. House districts, along with both U.S. Senate seats, not to mention control of the state government and legislature. When asked whether the pendulum has started to swing back toward Democrats, he conceded there's truth to the idea. \"That's the way politics works,\" he said. While Perdue doesn't think Georgia is going to flip this year, he sees the parallels with the GOP's rise to power. \"I think when one political party in power has it for a long time, there's a complacency that comes in, and that's why people have choices. That's why we have two parties in this country \u2014 it holds us all accountable.\" Another observer who draws comparisons to the early 2000s is Heath Garrett, a longtime Georgia Republican strategist. Back then, \"the Democratic Party had become complacent,\" he said. \"Even though they knew that the demographic shifts had occurred numerically, intraparty fighting within the Democratic caucus, policy overreach, trying to do too much combined with the national Democratic Party brand starting to hurt the local Democratic Party brand,\" Garrett added, arguing that the national Democratic Party had moved further left than the Georgia electorate. Today, Garrett points to a new wave of demographic shifts changing Georgia's electorate. The state's immigrant population has grown and voters have gotten younger and more diverse \u2014 all constituencies that lean more Democratic. Meanwhile, Republicans aren't changing as quickly, just like Democrats didn't years ago. Infighting \"We also see a lot of very competitive intraparty Republican fighting trying to pull the Republican primaries farther to the right, just about the same time that the general election in Georgia is moving more to the center,\" Garrett said. \"Which creates the same conundrum for Republicans today that Democrats had 20 years ago.\" Garrett is \"cautiously optimistic\" that his party can get organized in time for this year's election. But the most high-profile intraparty fight that could challenge GOP unity is between Sen. Kelly Loeffler and U.S. Rep. Doug Collins. They're facing off in a special free-for-all election for Loeffler's Senate seat in November to fill out the remainder of the term left by Sen. Johnny Isakson's retirement. Loeffler was appointed in December to replace Isakson. The contest has already gotten nasty, the last thing Georgia Republicans needed in a race that was already showing signs of being challenging. \"It troubles me we're going to have this fight among Republicans,\" said Martha Zoller, a conservative talk show host and Loeffler supporter. \"And it's going to be a very weird fight because it's a special election ... so that's going to muddy the waters quite a bit.\" Twenty-one candidates have qualified for the special election in November, when voters will also choose between incumbent Republican Sen. David Perdue (a cousin of Sonny Perdue) and the winner of this week's Democratic primary. \"It's not 2006 anymore\" Democrats have been tightening Georgia's election results in recent years. In 2016, Donald Trump won by about 5 points. In 2018, Republican Gov. Brian Kemp defeated his Democratic opponent by about 1.5 points. In 2018, Democrats flipped one suburban Atlanta Republican U.S. House seat and came close to winning another. Recent Georgia polling puts former Vice President Joe Biden, the likely Democratic presidential candidate, neck and neck with President Trump. \"In general, Georgia Republicans have to just really reckon with the fact that it's not 2006 anymore,\" said Andra Gillespie, a political science professor at Emory University, citing demographic shifts and growing organization and voter registration by Democrats. \"[Republicans] shouldn't expect to win elections in landslides, and they shouldn't expect to win by comfortable margins.\" It's all compounded, Gillespie said, by this season's headlines, including the protests against racial injustice and the coronavirus pandemic. 2020 will be the most \"difficult to anticipate\" presidential outcome in Georgia since 1996, said Charles Bullock, a political scientist at the University of Georgia. Bullock has seen two main responses from Republicans to the unfavorable demographic trends. Some Republicans have attempted to moderate their policies and rhetoric. But he calls others, \"kamikazes,\" who have responded to the changes in the state by pushing through polarizing conservative legislation, such as Georgia's recent anti-abortion law. \"Now you see Republicans beginning to wake up and take note and wonder if the strategy they had in the can is going to pull them out this time,\" said Teresa Tomlinson, a longtime Democrat who is running in the Democratic Senate primary. \"With this kind of sustained power, this longevity of 18 to 20 years of one-party political dominance, with it comes a complicity,\" she argued. \"A reservedness to do anything different.\" One Republican who says he's awake to the change is the state's senior U.S. senator, David Perdue. In audio obtained by CNN, he told activists that Georgia \"is in play\" and that \"Democrats have made it that way.\" Casey Black, Perdue's spokeswoman, said the campaign has known that his race would be competitive \"from day one\" and remains \"confident voters will reelect him to the U.S. Senate.\"",

Steve King is facing a fierce primary challenge from fellow Republicans after years of incendiary comments about abortion, immigrants and Islam.\n                \n                    \n                    Charlie Neibergall/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Iowa Rep. Steve King is facing a fierce primary challenge from fellow Republicans after years of incendiary comments about abortion, immigrants and Islam. With everything going in the country \u2014 from the unrest in many cities after the death of George Floyd at the hands of police to the coronavirus pandemic \u2014 it's easy to have missed that elections are being held. But several states and the District of Columbia have primaries up and down the ballot: Indiana, Iowa, Maryland, Montana, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and South Dakota. Pennsylvania is holding primary voting on Tuesday, though Gov. Tom Wolf extended the deadline for voting by mail by one week, until June 9. Here are the races to watch. Live results will appear Tuesday evening. Presidential primaries press on. Former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, has not yet officially clinched the nomination. He went into the day 425 delegates short of the magic number of 1,991. With 500 delegates at stake Tuesday, he needs 85% of the delegates up for grabs, which he's unlikely to get. More likely, Biden will cross the threshold next week, June 9, when Georgia and West Virginia vote, with their 133 delegates at stake (and when we'll get the results of Pennsylvania's primary, with its 186 delegates). Loading... Rep. Steve King on the ropes. The controversial Iowa conservative faces real danger in his primary for reelection from Iowa's 4th Congressional District. After racist and pro-white nationalist remarks, much of the Republican establishment abandoned King. They've come for him before in his almost 20 years in Congress unsuccessfully. But this has been their best chance so far. King has trailed in the polls, with only $30,000 cash on hand and no TV ads running. The favorite among his challengers has been state Sen. Randy Feenstra, who has painted King as ineffective in the House, given that he was stripped of key committee assignments. But King is well known as a familiar choice for conservatives in western Iowa and has been resilient. Polls close at 10 p.m. ET Loading... In Iowa's 2nd Congressional District, Democratic Rep. Dave Loebsack is retiring, opening up his seat. Former state Sen. Rita Hart will be the Democratic nominee and will face either state Sen. Mariannette Miller-Meeks or ex-Illinois Congressman Bobby Schilling, who moved to Iowa in 2017. Miller-Meeks got the backing of Gov. Kim Reynolds and Sen. Joni Ernst, as well as House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. Former Sen. Rick Santorum and Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, a top Trump ally, have backed Schilling. Polls close at 10 p.m. ET Loading... Steny Hoyer faces a challenge from the left. A veteran lawmaker from Maryland's 5th Congressional District and No. 2 in House Democratic leadership, Hoyer faces a progressive primary challenge from 29-year-old Mckayla Wilkes. Wilkes, a single mother, was inspired by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's victory in New York in 2018 over another veteran white male Democratic leader. Wilkes raised $300,000 and said Hoyer, who has been in Congress almost 40 years, is out of touch with the district. The Democratic establishment has remained behind Hoyer, though, including the Congressional Black Caucus, which endorsed him. He has outspent Wilkes $2.7 million to $237,000. Polls close at 8 p.m. ET Loading... Spy games in New Mexico. The announced retirement of New Mexico Sen. Tom Udall set off a domino effect. Democratic Rep. Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n declared for Udall's Senate seat, leaving open his seat in the 3rd Congressional District. Enter: Valerie Plame, the ex-CIA agent. She has raised and spent more than any candidate in this race and gained national attention with her glossy campaign ad showing her racing backward in a Chevy Camaro on a dusty road. But locally, her candidacy has looked less like an easy Sunday drive. She faced criticism for being a relative newcomer, moving to the area in 2007; the district is 41% Latino and 19% Native American, and another candidate, Teresa Leger Fernandez, got the endorsements of the political arm of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and EMILY's List. Polls close at 9 p.m. ET Loading... It is very possible that New Mexico sends an all-female House delegation to Congress in 2021, as freshman Democrats Deb Haaland and Xochitl Torres Small are the incumbents in the state's other two districts. But Torres Small has to win what's expected to be a tough reelection race in the 2nd District. Trump won there by 10 points in 2016, and the primary to decide who will take on Torres Small this fall is a contest between two Republican women. It has been a nasty primary between Yvette Herrell, the 2018 nominee, and Claire Chase, an oil executive. Both have campaigned on who's the most pro-Trump; Herrell got the backing of the House Freedom Caucus, but Chase has outraised and outspent Herrell, with support from Defending Main Street, a group with ties to establishment Republicans. Polls close at 9 p.m. ET Loading... Senate matchups to be set in Iowa and Montana. Democrats are hoping to take back the Senate this fall. They have an outside shot at that right now, but their odds have looked increasingly better of late. Partially, that's because of these two races. In Iowa, Democrats are targeting incumbent Republican Joni Ernst, but first there's the primary Tuesday. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee has backed real estate executive Theresa Greenfield in the four-way contest. Greenfield raised $7.1 million and went into Tuesday as the favorite. Other Democrats include retired Adm. Mike Franken, attorney Kimberly Graham and Eddie Mauro, a businessman and former teacher and coach who has spent the second most \u2014 $1.4 million \u2014 on this primary. Polls close at 10 p.m. ET Loading... When Montana Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock changed his mind and decided to challenge incumbent Republican Sen. Steve Daines, it suddenly put this race on the map for Democrats in a big way. Three other Democrats are on the ballot Tuesday, but Bullock has been expected to win easily, raising more than 10 times what his next opponent has. Polls close at 10 p.m. ET Loading... Indiana openings. The retirements of moderate Democrat Pete Visclosky in Indiana's 1st District and Republican Susan Brooks, one of only 13 Republican women in Congress, in the 5th District has opened up both of these ideologically divergent seats. More than half a dozen Democrats are competing in the 1st District, which is suburban and exurban Chicago, a place that went for Hillary Clinton with 54% of the vote in 2016. Polls close at 7 p.m. ET Loading... In the 5th District, a handful of Republicans have duked it out, including state Sen. Victoria Spartz, who raised and spent the most and got the backing of the Club for Growth, and Beth Henderson, a local businesswoman with the endorsement of Indiana Sen. Mike Braun. Democrats have rallied around one candidate, Christina Hale. This district has been in GOP hands for a long time, but it could be one to watch this fall. The Cook Political Report lists it as only \"lean Republican.\" Trump won it with 53% in 2016. Polls close at 6 p.m. ET Loading...",

The filing deadline for the Aug. 4 primary is Monday.\n                \n                    \n                    Nicholas Kamm/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had been approached to run for the U.S. Senate from Kansas, but he has demurred. The filing deadline for the Aug. 4 primary is Monday. With control of the U.S. Senate up for grabs in November, Republicans may have fights on their hands in states they have long taken for granted: Kansas, for example. The GOP has held both of the state's Senate seats since the Great Depression. However, as they approach a Monday, June 1, filing deadline, party leaders are not confident that any of the candidates now in the field are a lock to hold onto retiring Sen. Pat Roberts's seat. Democrats hope that a victory in Kansas in November can help deliver them a majority in the U.S. Senate, which, if they win the White House as well, will provide a major boost to the party's legislative priorities. Those concerns prompted Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to intensify his efforts to convince U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to run. The former GOP congressman from Kansas has rejected those overtures, but rumors of a last-minute entry persist. Referencing the upcoming filing deadline in a recent interview on Fox News, McConnell said, \"I guess the suspense won't last much longer.\" Mike Kuckelman, chair of the Kansas Republican Party, said he has not \"heard anything\" from Pompeo to indicate that the secretary of state has changed his mind. \"I think he's been pretty clear that he's not going to\" run, Kuckelman said. Even so, Kansas Senate President Susan Wagle's abrupt decision Thursday to drop out of the race signaled that party leaders were working behind the scenes to thin the field in an effort to avoid a bruising primary. In a statement announcing her decision, Wagle said she had spoken with state and national party leaders and did not want to participate in \"a primary fight that will divide our party.\" The announcement came only days after an interview in which Wagle vowed to stay in the race unless Pompeo got in. \"I've talked to Mike,\" Wagle said. \"I've told him if he wants to get in, I'm out.\" However, based on her conversations with Pompeo, Wagle said, \"I believe he'll stay secretary of state; that's more important.\" Several weeks ago, Kuckelman called on Wagle and Dave Lindstrom, a former player for the Kansas City Chiefs, to exit the race. Both angrily declined. Wagle's change of heart came on the heels of Kansans for Life, the state's leading anti-abortion organization, endorsing 1st District Congressman Roger Marshall for the Republican nomination. While many of the candidates in field had strong anti-abortion credentials, the organization said in its endorsement that Marshall, a retired obstetrician from western Kansas, \"gives pro-lifers the best chance of defeating abortion fanatic Barbara Bollier.\" Bollier, a state senator and retired physician from the Kansas City suburb of Mission Hills, is the presumptive Democratic nominee. A former Republican, she switched parties in 2018, after concluding she was an outlier on issues ranging from abortion to Medicaid expansion. \"The party's value system just didn't match mine,\" Bollier said during a recent tele-town hall with voters, part of what she's calling her \"virtual bus tour.\" Bollier, thanks in part to contributions flooding in from across the country, is out-fundraising everyone in the Republican field. She raised more than $1 million her first month in the race and followed that up by taking in another $2.4 million in the first three months of this year. Former Kansas Democratic Gov. Kathleen Sebelius said Bollier is the \"right candidate at the right time.\" \"A doctor, a no-nonsense legislator, she's got the whole package,\" said Sebelius, a former secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services during the Obama administration. \"At a time when people are looking for compassionate, competent government, I think she's got a real shot,\" Sebelius said. That is what worries Republicans, particularly if former Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach captures their nomination. Kobach is a polarizing figure. His populist rhetoric and reputation as an anti-immigration hardliner make him a favorite of Trump voters but alienate GOP moderates and independents. In announcing his candidacy last July, Kobach said he was not running to be the \"quiet useful tool\" sought by McConnell. \"The Washington establishment is not going to get what they want if I'm elected,\" he said to cheers at his announcement rally. With backing from Trump, Kobach narrowly won the Republican nomination for governor in 2018 but lost the general election to Democrat Laura Kelly. That loss worries many Republicans, including Marshall, Kobach's chief rival for the Senate nomination, who asks, \"Here we are in a state that President Trump won by over 20 points, how does a Kansas Republican lose a governor's race?\" Several establishment Republicans who share those concerns have endorsed Marshall. They include Bob Dole, the former U.S. senator and presidential candidate, and former Gov. Jeff Colyer. \"You are starting to see a consolidation of people behind Roger Marshall,\" Colyer said. \"He is a candidate who can win.\" A recent poll conducted by the National Republican Senatorial Committee confirms the fears of some party leaders. It shows Kobach would be a dead heat at 44% to 43% in a head-to-head match-up against Bollier, with 12% of voters undecided, the Kansas City Star reported. The same poll showed Marshall leading Bollier 46% to 35% with 18% undecided. Initial polls showed Kobach leading in the race for the GOP nomination,  but the most recent survey showed Marshall with a 7-point lead. The primary is Aug. 4.",

            "article_content": "Republicans have had both of Kansas' Senate seats since the Great Depression. But this year they are worried they could lose them \u2014 some state's suburbs have started trending towards Democrats.  MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: The race for control of the Senate is getting increasingly competitive. One place of concern for Republicans is Kansas. While the GOP primary is not until August, there is a June 1 filing deadline. And for the first time in a long time, party leaders aren't sure the field includes someone who can win come November. Jim McLean of the Kansas News Service reports. JIM MCLEAN, BYLINE: Republicans have had an absolute lock on both of Kansas's Senate seats since the Great Depression. But their decades-long winning streak could be in jeopardy this year. Pat Roberts, the 83-year-old incumbent, isn't running. Neither, it appears, is Mike Pompeo. Despite recent abuse-of-power allegations leveled against him, many GOP leaders believe the U.S. secretary of state and former Kansas congressman would be their strongest candidate. In a recent Fox News interview, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell talked about his ongoing efforts to recruit Pompeo. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MITCH MCCONNELL: You can see how well I've done so far (laughter). BRET BAIER: Are you still hopeful on that front? MCCONNELL: Well, the filing deadline is June 1, so I guess the suspense won't last much longer. MCLEAN: There isn't any real suspense on this end, says Kansas Republican Party Chair Mike Kuckelman. MIKE KUCKELMAN: I've not heard anything from Pompeo's team that he's looking at it or that he has any interest in doing it this time, and I think he's been pretty clear that he's not going to. MCLEAN: With Pompeo out, former Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach is a front-runner for the nomination. He's a polarizing figure who appeals to many Trump voters but alienates moderates and independents. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KRIS KOBACH: The Washington establishment wants a tool - a quiet, useful tool who will keep the status quo going. Well, guess what? The Washington establishment is not going to get what they want if I'm... MCLEAN: Kobach's record as an anti-immigration hard-liner aligns him with President Trump, who endorsed Kobach's 2018 bid for governor but joked about having second thoughts. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: If he loses, I'll bring him into my administration in two seconds. I hope he loses 'cause I want him so badly, but don't do that. Don't... MCLEAN: But Kobach did lose that race to Democrat Laura Kelly, and that has some Republicans worried about his chances this time around. Congressman Roger Marshall, Kobach's chief rival for the Senate nomination, stokes those concerns at every turn. ROGER MARSHALL: Here we are in a state that President Trump won by over 20 points. How does a Kansas Republican lose a governor's race? MCLEAN: Many establishment Republicans are coalescing around Marshall, a retired doctor from western Kansas. But Kobach, noting he's won 2 of 3 statewide races, says too much is being made of his loss to Kelly in what he calls a blue wave election. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KOBACH: But basically, that's the only argument they got. And so they keep saying it over and over again. MCLEAN: Democrat Barbara Bollier will be waiting for the winner of the GOP slugfest. She's also a retired doctor and state senator from the Kansas City suburbs. She left the Republican Party in 2018 when she says her positions on abortion and Medicaid expansion made her an outlier. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BARBARA BOLLIER: For the first time ever, I don't have that pit in my stomach, that stress of knowing I don't agree with so many of the policies they're trying to bring forward. MCLEAN: With backing from Governor Kelly and former Kansas governor and Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, Bollier is out-fundraising everyone on the Republican side. For Democrats, Sebelius says, she's the right candidate at the right time. KATHLEEN SEBELIUS: And I think at a time when people are looking for compassionate, competent government, she's got a real shot. MCLEAN: A shot, but a lot of history to overcome because when it comes to U.S. Senate races, Kansas Democrats own the nation's longest losing streak. For NPR News, I'm Jim McLean.

            "article_content": "NPR's Lulu Garcia Navarro discusses the week at the White House and in the Joe Biden campaign with NPR's Domenico Montanaro.  LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST: On this Sunday morning, when many churchgoers are staying home, President Trump is demanding that states allow houses of worship to reopen. But even the president's own health experts are saying it may not yet be safe. The politics of reopening are where we begin our conversation with NPR's Domenico Montanaro, our senior political editor and correspondent. Good morning. DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Hey there, Lulu. GARCIA-NAVARRO: The president is very eager for the country to get back to normal, even though the coronavirus pandemic has not abated. Why has he taken such a hard line on houses of worship in particular? MONTANARO: Well, you know, it's hard not to see politics in this. I mean, white evangelicals are a strong part of the president's base. He made this false comparison between houses of worship and liquor stores and abortion clinics, saying that one side essentially wants those open and deems those essential and doesn't believe churches, synagogues and mosques are essential. I mean, these are really apples and oranges. His own administration has warned against gatherings of 10 or more people because of the respiratory spread of the virus. You know, and Trump also said he'd override states that don't allow houses of worship to reopen. This is just trying to create a political fight, centering, you know, once again, really, on this president, you know, wanting to ramp up the culture war. And we're going to see way more of it as the election gets nearer and is now almost five months away. GARCIA-NAVARRO: President Trump also took in a round of golf yesterday - something he hadn't done since March - on a day when we're approaching a hundred thousand deaths in this country... MONTANARO: Yeah. GARCIA-NAVARRO: ...Because of COVID-19. I guess the question is, why is it so important to the president to demonstrate his own ability to get back to normal, even though things are so far from it? It seems like he's trying to almost shape a different reality. MONTANARO: Well, I'm sure he, like others, frustrated, you know, staying inside, not being able to do recreational activities we all enjoy. He was in Virginia where his golf club is, and golf courses are allowed to be open there. But for the president, he also really desperately wants to show the country as a whole getting back to normal. It helps him politically. Part of looking like things are normal for him is also his refusal to wear a mask in public. He said last week that he doesn't want to give the media the satisfaction of seeing him with one on. That really doesn't make much sense to me because his own administration's guidelines are to wear a mask in public when you're within six feet of other people. And the country is at a perilous stage, as you noted. The - with the virus, we're approaching a hundred thousand deaths from it. And as, you know, he's the one who's in charge, he shaped the narrative on this in the first place. It wasn't that long ago, remember, that his administration was recommending against people wearing masks or trying to get them so first responders didn't have their supplies cut short. And then you had Trump telling people that they should wear face coverings and scarves and that that could make a big difference. So this idea now that we're seeing wearing a mask as somehow as a virtue signal for which party you belong to is just really not helpful to stopping the spread of the virus. But it's not surprising when you see scenes of people this Memorial Day weekend on beach boardwalks in close proximity to others, not wearing masks, because you have a leader not demonstrating the thing his administration wants others to do. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Just briefly, let's talk about Joe Biden, the Democratic candidate. He's been trying to highlight the president's mistakes on the pandemic, but he got into some trouble of his own, making some controversial comments about black voters. He said if African American voters can't decide between him and Trump, then they, quote, \"ain't black.\" MONTANARO: Yeah. Well... GARCIA-NAVARRO: What did that reveal? MONTANARO: It's another example of Biden stepping in it and making an unforced error. He walked it back quickly the other day, saying that he was being too much of a wise guy and shouldn't have been so cavalier. But it's exactly the kind of thing that had Democratic veteran strategists worried about Biden being the nominee because it gave fuel to conservatives in an area they didn't have much before. And you know, look. Trump, of course, has his own history of inflaming racial tensions and divides. And at the end of the day, one of two people's going to be elected president, Trump or Biden. And African Americans are going to have a decision to make on who represents them best. But Biden doesn't want to offend younger African Americans in particular, who haven't been totally sold by his candidacy. GARCIA-NAVARRO: NPR's Domenico Montanaro, thank you so much.

            "article_content": "While Donald Trump won the Catholic vote in 2016, his chances of winning the group again might be complicated by the growing number of Latino Catholic voters and Joe Biden being Catholic himself.\n                \n                    \n                    Kirby Lee/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption While Donald Trump won the Catholic vote in 2016, his chances of winning the group again might be complicated by the growing number of Latino Catholic voters and Joe Biden being Catholic himself. The 2016 election highlighted Donald Trump's successful courtship of white evangelicals. This year, much of the focus could be on Catholics. The presidential campaigns are fighting for votes in the Catholic-rich Midwestern states, and the presumptive Democratic nominee, Joe Biden, is himself a Catholic. \"You could view it as the ultimate swing constituency in the country,\" says Matt Schlapp, a conservative activist and co-chair of the newly formed \"Catholics for Trump\" coalition. He was speaking last month on EWTN, a Catholic cable network. The Trump outreach effort is troubling some Catholic leaders. The church's official document on political participation, Forming Consciences for Faithful Citizenship, eschews any partisan viewpoint, a position consistent with requirements in the U.S. tax code. \"Part of the church's mission is to shape the moral character of society,\" says Chieko Noguchi, spokesperson for the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops. \"But the church isn't aligned with any political party, and it doesn't support or oppose any candidate for elective office.\" When the Trump campaign in March announced it intended to launch the \"Catholics for Trump\" movement at a rally in Wisconsin, the archbishop of Milwaukee, Jerome Listecki, took pains in an archdiocese statement to distance his church from the effort. \"The Catholic Church and the Archdiocese of Milwaukee are not endorsing the rally and are in no way affiliated to or sponsoring this event or campaign locally, statewide, or nationally,\" Listecki said. \"The mission of the church is religious, not political.\" That message is not what President Trump wants Catholics to hear, however. Although the Milwaukee rally was postponed because of the coronavirus epidemic, the campaign proceeded with an online appeal to Catholic voters, and the effort to win their support remains a top priority. On a recent Saturday, Trump hosted a call with several hundred Catholic leaders from around the country. Although the call was private, two participants on the call told the online newspaper Crux that Trump repeatedly made a case for his reelection and urged the Catholic leaders to support him. Cardinal Timothy Dolan was reportedly the first to respond, noting how often he speaks on the phone to the president. Trump was delighted and announced he would watch Cardinal Dolan's online service the next day at St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York. On the following Monday, Dolan was interviewed on Fox News. \"It was sure good to have the president with us yesterday,\" Dolan told the Fox & Friends show. \"I really salute his leadership.\" Progressive Catholics and others who want to keep their church out of politics were dismayed. In an editorial, the National Catholic Reporter called the exchange between Dolan and the president \"cringe-worthy.\" \"We think Cardinal Timothy Dolan ... was really making a mistake in letting this president co-opt him in an attempt to get Catholic votes,\" says Heidi Schlumpf, the magazine's newly named editor-in-chief. \"We called it an unholy alliance.\" Like everyone else, however, Catholics are divided. While the church advocates for immigrants and the poor and opposes the death penalty, it vigorously opposes abortion and same-sex marriage. Where Catholics come down politically depends in large part on which of those issues matter most to them. Surveys suggest that most Catholics voted for Trump in the last election, and many continue to support him. The group CatholicVote.Org hosted a friendly town hall last week with Mick Mulvaney, Trump's former chief of staff and a devout Catholic. One of the program hosts, former Republican Congressman Tim Huelskamp, asked Mulvaney what guidance he had for those Catholics considering whom to support in the fall election. Mulvaney's answer was clear: Catholics should not consider voting for a Democrat. \"There is something that doesn't connect any more between faith and the Democrat Party,\" Mulvaney said. \"You may like Democrats, but you put the Democrats in charge, and the values that you carry as a Roman Catholic are going to suffer.\" The party's near-unanimous support for abortion rights, Mulvaney suggested, was \"by itself\" disqualifying. \"If you want to see your values reflected in policy, there's really no choice,\" he said. \"You have to not only vote the Republican Party, but you have to help get them elected.\" Given that Catholics bring a multitude of values to their political choices, however, Catholics should keep all of the church's positions in mind, rather than focus solely on abortion, advises the National Catholic Reporter's Schlumpf. \"Church teaching says that we need to have a consistent ethic of life, where we look at all human life as valuable,\" she says. \"That's why we see this cozying up with one party over a specific issue \u2014 admittedly an important issue for many Catholics \u2014 as problematic.\" This year, Democrats intend to compete vigorously with Republicans for the support of Catholic voters. They may be helped by having a ticket led by a Catholic. Also, the Catholic electorate includes a growing number of Latinos \u2014 most of whom opposed Trump in 2016. A February poll by EWTN News and RealClear Opinion Research showed Biden leading Trump among Catholic voters, but Trump led among those who describe themselves as more active in their faith \u2014 attending Mass weekly and praying frequently.",

            "article_content": "In a new digital ad campaign, the abortion rights group NARAL is accusing President Trump and his Republican allies of exploiting the coronavirus pandemic to restrict abortion access. The new six-figure digital ad campaign targets voters in several swing states. Republican governors and attorneys general in states including Texas and Louisiana have ordered the suspension of most abortions during the pandemic as part of a shutdown of nonessential medical procedures. Reproductive rights groups have persuaded federal judges to block or partially scale back those orders. But legal battles are continuing, and patients have been turned away in some states. A new ad from the abortion rights group NARAL Freedom Fund features young women accusing the President and his allies of putting \"ideology over science,\" and using the coronavirus pandemic as a pretext to \"roll back the clock\" on reproductive rights. NARAL has said its political arm is spending nearly $35 million overall for the 2020 election cycle to target voters in Arizona, Colorado, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Georgia, Iowa, and North Carolina. The group says it's focusing efforts this year on women and other persuadable voters who see reproductive rights as a motivating concern. In a statement to NPR, Trump campaign Communications Director Tim Murtaugh said, \"It's disgusting, but not surprising, that the extreme abortion lobby would try to use a global health crisis to promote the killing of unborn children.\" Anti-abortion rights groups also are urging state and federal officials to restrict access to abortion during the pandemic.",

            "article_content": "The U.S. coronavirus curve rises while China's flattens. The pandemic opens a new front in the abortion battle. And, Bloomberg staffers say they were promised jobs through November, some are suing.  RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: Are enough Americans following national guidelines to reduce the spread of the coronavirus? STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Well, Deborah Birx, a key member of the White House pandemic task force, says no. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DEBORAH BIRX: We're only as strong as every community, every county, every state, every American following the guidelines to a T. And I can tell by the curve and as it is today that not every American is following it. And so this is really a call to action. INSKEEP: Dr. Birx is referring to a national curve of casualties, of people sick, of people dead. It shows the rising number of infections in this country just as Chinese officials say their curve is flattening. MARTIN: And that's where we're going to focus the conversation with NPR's Jason Beaubien. Hi, Jason. JASON BEAUBIEN, BYLINE: Hey. Good morning. MARTIN: So China's government is reporting that the number of COVID-19 cases there is close to zero now. I mean... BEAUBIEN: Yeah. MARTIN: ...Is that true? And does that mean things are inching back to normal there? BEAUBIEN: China's in a precarious situation. You know, they've driven down numbers to close to zero, yet they still have large parts of their population that are susceptible to this virus. The virus is still circulating at a low level. They've got travelers who are showing up and reintroducing the virus. So while China is looking to reopen its economy - and it has started to reopen its economy - it's doing it very cautiously. You know, and there's good reasons for that. I spoke with Kylie Ainslie. She's a researcher and analyst at Imperial College London. And she said that's because they're worried that there could be a second wave of the virus. MARTIN: A second wave. So there's a fear that another outbreak - after all, this another outbreak could flare up? BEAUBIEN: Absolutely. It's a reasonable fear, except Ainslie and her colleagues haven't seen that happening yet. They're looking at data on human movement. And they're seeing in areas that had less COVID-19, people are being allowed to move around more freely sooner. And that seems to be the strategy. Chinese officials are slowly dialing back these social restrictions one area at a time. You know, if a flare-up occurs, it could be easier to catch. And restrictions like school closures are still in place. And then when necessary, they're tightening restrictions. For instance, they're - banned foreign nationals from entering the country, you know, like they did last week. MARTIN: So, I mean, what does that mean for the U.S. Is that what we here could be facing? After we get through the worst of this outbreak, are we still going to have to practice social distancing for an untold number of weeks to avoid a second wave? BEAUBIEN: Well, the peak of China's outbreak was six weeks ago. And we're only now seeing some of the travel restrictions lifted there. And unfortunately, some people are telling me that it looks like it might even be longer here in the U.S. China in this outbreak, you know, benefited from having a strong - some would say authoritarian - government. And they've been able to very aggressively track down people who may have been exposed, put them into quarantine. The U.S., on the other hand, you know, is having outbreaks that are playing out across the country in very different ways and at different times. Potentially, you could have New York getting past this crisis but then other areas just starting to heat up. And that could lead to a situation where one part of the country is reinfecting another. You know, and that could force health officials to keep these shelter-in-place, these stay-at-home orders even longer. There might need to be strict domestic travel restrictions. You know, and that could mean that, yeah, all of this might get dragged out even longer than what China was seeing. MARTIN: So is that what we're looking at? I mean what can help the situation here? Tighter guidelines? More mandated restrictions? BEAUBIEN: You know, so we haven't even gotten to that suppression phase that China is in. We are still in the controlling it phase. Last night, a White House official told NPR that the Trump administration is preparing to do something else to try to control it. And they're going to recommend that people wear face masks in public if they live in areas with high clusters of cases. Birx made it clear that the masks would not be in place of social distancing, just an added measure. And also, you know, they're ramping up testing of the results that the White House task force is getting back. They show pretty starkly where the problems are. Two states, New York and New Jersey, are reporting 35% of their tests are coming back positive, which is a really high number. Louisiana is at 26. Michigan, Georgia and Illinois are at 15. And this gives us a good indication of where the next real hotspots could be. MARTIN: OK. You can wear a mask, but you still have to stay 6 feet away from people. BEAUBIEN: Right. MARTIN: NPR's Jason Beaubien, thank you. BEAUBIEN: You're welcome. MARTIN: The pandemic is opening up a new front in the battle over abortion in this country. INSKEEP: Because officials in some states say abortions are not essential medical procedures, so they have pushed orders to restrict them during the outbreak. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PATRICK MORRISSEY: That is designed to conserve supply, devices, ventilators and to limit the spread of coronavirus. So there's going to be a reduction in all elective procedures. And yes, there will be a reduction in the procedures within abortion facilities. INSKEEP: That's West Virginia's attorney general, Patrick Morrissey, in a press briefing yesterday. MARTIN: NPR national correspondent Sarah McCammon has been following this and joins us on the line. Hi, Sarah. SARAH MCCAMMON, BYLINE: Good morning. MARTIN: What states are we talking about? Where is this happening? MCCAMMON: So several states have orders in place banning non-essential procedures. And in a handful of states - places like Ohio and Alabama, Texas Oklahoma - Republican governors or attorneys general have tried to apply those to abortion. They're saying abortion is not essential. Now, major medical groups say abortion is time-sensitive, and delaying the procedure can be harmful to patients. And reproductive rights advocates have taken these states to court. They've been successful so far in Ohio and Alabama, where federal courts have blocked the bans, at least for now. But at least in Texas and Oklahoma, abortion clinics have had to shut down. A federal appeals court allowed that Texas ban to stand earlier this week. And there is a hearing scheduled for later today in Oklahoma. We're also watching West Virginia, where, as we heard, the attorney general has been saying this week that that order to suspend elective procedures will apply to at least some abortions. MARTIN: If a woman in one of those states needs a surgical abortion, what are her options, then? MCCAMMON: Well, I've been talking to doctors and providers. I spoke to two doctors in Texas and an administrator of a clinic in Oklahoma. And they've been turning hundreds of patients away. They say that they don't have a lot of answers for them right now. The doctors in Texas said they'd stop performing all types of abortion, both surgical and medication-induced. So abortion just isn't available in Texas right now. I also spoke to a woman named Megan (ph) - we're just using her first name to protect her privacy - who was turned away from a clinic in Oklahoma City this week. MEGAN: And immediately, I just, like, broke down 'cause, like, what am I going to do? You know, I just lost my job 'cause of the coronavirus. Like, I already have a 10-month-old daughter. I don't know what I'm going to do, you know? MCCAMMON: She was able to get an appointment and make a last minute trip to Kansas, about a five-hour round trip. But doctors tell me many patients can't make those trips. A doctor in Houston said he's concerned because some patients are asking about dangerous home remedies because they feel so desperate. MARTIN: I mean, could these bans be in effect indefinitely? Or is there an effort to overturn them? MCCAMMON: Well, it's impossible to say how long they'll be in effect. Some of these overarching orders suspending nonessential procedures do have expiration dates. But as the pandemic continues, we could see those expanded. And again, some states are applying that to abortion. A lot hinges on what happens in federal courts. And this is an issue that could ultimately end up before the U.S. Supreme Court. But for now, some patients cannot get abortions in some states. MARTIN: Without crossing into another state, presumably. NPR's Sarah McCammon, thank you. MCCAMMON: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MARTIN: All right. Mike Bloomberg's presidential campaign was historically short and historically expensive. INSKEEP: Yeah. He spent close to $1 billion on his campaign and put nearly 2,000 employees on the payroll. Those staffers say they were promised their jobs through November, even if Bloomberg's campaign ended far before that, as, in fact, it did. Now hundreds of his former field organizers are out of work, and some are suing the campaign. MARTIN: NPR's Juana Summers has had exclusive conversations with some of those staffers. And she joins us this morning. Hi, Juana. JUANA SUMMERS, BYLINE: Hey there. MARTIN: Who have you been talking to, and what have they told you? SUMMERS: Sure. I've spoken with a number of Mike Bloomberg's former field organizers across the country. And the former workers I talked with told me when they were hired by Bloomberg's campaign, they were offered more money than anyone else, great benefits and that he also offered them something else, a job through the general election, even if he was not the party's nominee. One of those staffers was Amol Jethwani, who worked for Bloomberg's campaign in Miami-Dade County in Florida. And part of his job was to interview other potential staffers who wanted to join the campaign. AMOL JETHWANI: And as part of our hiring guidelines - was to utilize the line that employment is guaranteed through November. Location is not. SUMMERS: But staffers were let go in two waves of layoffs over the month of March. They were told that they could apply for jobs with the Democratic National Committee in a number of battleground states. Bloomberg, of course, donated $18 million to that battleground effort. But they weren't guaranteed. They still had to go through a competitive hiring process that's still ongoing. MARTIN: Huh. So is Mike Bloomberg saying anything about this? I mean, what's his defense? SUMMERS: Yeah. So late last night, we got a statement from Bloomberg's campaign manager Kevin Sheekey. He tells NPR that the campaign reached out to every organizing staffer in six battleground states, as well as others, and that they asked them to consider working for the DNC. He says that hundreds of former Bloomberg staffers have already been contacted, already in that hiring pipeline to join the DNC is efforts. And Sheekey insists that that would not have happened without the campaign's massive donation to the party. He also pointed out a couple of other things. He says that staff worked about 39 days on average. They were given several weeks of severance, health care through March. The campaign has also established a fund to cover the costs of COBRA for the month of April for health care, something Sheekey says no other campaign has done. And the hope here from the campaign is that in time, many of those staffers will be swept up, hired by the DNC, so the gap in employment they'll see, hopefully, will be minimal. MARTIN: Right. But a hope isn't the same as a guarantee. Do the people behind the lawsuit have a chance here at winning the suit? SUMMERS: Yeah. Rachel, that's exactly what they point out. There isn't a guarantee. So I called a labor lawyer about this, about this legal action that many of the staffers are pursuing. And he made the point to me, essentially, that this is an uphill battle for a lot of those folks. He says he sees a lot of these cases. And oftentimes, when you're getting a new job, your boss tells you something that sounds really good. Employees are hesitant to tell their boss to write that down on paper, to put that in a contract in writing. That gets employees in trouble. But Matthew Jeweler worked for the Bloomberg campaign in Colorado and says that's not the point. MATTHEW JEWELER: The man spent $500 million on a ads alone in a four-month period. He could spend 10% of that and give every single one of his field staff their entire salaries for the remainder of the year. SUMMERS: So regardless to how these legal challenges turn out, these staffers are still out of work during a global pandemic, making it hard to get another job. And they feel like they've put their reputation on a line, told job candidates they had guaranteed work, just as they were told by the people that hired them. And they don't have it. MARTIN: NPR's Juana Summers, we appreciate it. Thank you. SUMMERS: Thanks. Copyright \u00a9 2020 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Rep. Dan Lipinski, a moderate eight-term Democratic congressman from Illinois, lost his primary on Tuesday to progressive challenger Marie Newman. Newman, a business consultant and founder of an anti-bullying nonprofit, narrowly lost to Lipinski in a 2018 primary in a suburban Chicago district by about 2 points. Loading... One of the last anti-abortion Democrats in Congress, Lipinski often bucked the mainstream of his party. He declined to endorse President Barack Obama in 2012, voted against the Affordable Care Act and opposed same-sex marriage until the U.S. Supreme Court ruled to make it legal in 2015. \"I am bursting with pride and gratitude for the amazing coalition that helped bring about much needed change in our district,\" Newman wrote on Twitter. \"We are going to work together to lower health care costs, to fight climate change, and to build an economy that works for everyone.\" I am bursting with pride and gratitude for the amazing coalition that helped bring about much needed change in our district. We are going to work together to lower health care costs, to fight climate change, and to build an economy that works for everyone. #NewDayInIL03 #IL03 Justice Democrats, the group that helped Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez beat a long-serving Democratic incumbent in the 2018 primary, backed Newman's bid. \"This sends a message to every Democratic incumbent that if you don't vote like a Democrat, you will be held accountable,\" Alexandra Rojas, the group's executive director, wrote on Twitter. Congratulations to @Marie4Congress in #IL03This isn\u2019t just a loss for one incumbent. It\u2019s a defeat for machine politics and big corporate donors who want to stop our movement for Medicare for All, a Green New Deal, and reproductive rights. pic.twitter.com/yP30ZeZwl4 Lipinski has represented Illinois' 3rd Congressional District since 2005, when he took over from his father, Bill Lipinski, who first won the seat in 1982. \"I'm still a guy fighting for the little guy and gal in taking care of things in the communities,\" he told NPR's Kelsey Snell in 2018. \"And I think that's what people still care about.\" Lipinski's positions on major issues has increasingly raised questions among Democrats in recent years over what the party stands for. In 2018, Newman won endorsements from two members of the Illinois congressional delegation, including retiring Rep. Luis Gutierrez. \"He's just a dinosaur, shouldn't be there, should be a relic in some museum,\" he told NPR in 2018. \"This was the Democratic Party, you know, 1980.\" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has long insisted there should not be a litmus test on topics like abortion for Democratic candidates. In this cycle, while Pelosi visited the campaign offices of another centrist Democrat in a primary fight, Rep. Henry Cuellar of Texas, she did not lend the same assistance to Lipinski. Last year, Illinois Rep. Cheri Bustos, chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, scrapped a fundraiser planned for Lipinski. \"I get some heat for saying that not everybody has to be [pro-abortion rights],\" Pelosi said during a Georgetown University forum in 2018. \"When the day comes when we can say we don't want any of our voters to be anti-choice, then I think we'd have a right to say that we don't want any of our candidates to be anti-choice.\" Newman was also endorsed by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot and Ocasio-Cortez. Ocasio-Cortez and Justice Democrats plan to back more progressive challengers working to defeat centrist incumbents. So far this primary season, Lipinski is the only sitting member they have managed to oust.",

            "article_content": "NPR's Lulu Garcia-Navarro talks to freelance reporter Natalie Alcoba about demonstrations in Argentina over reproductive rights.  LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST: A historic change in Argentina may be at hand. Since the 1920s, abortion has been illegal there. Women can only seek one in the predominantly Catholic country in cases of rape or if the mother's life is at risk. But statistics suggest that hundreds of thousands of often unsafe, illegal abortions take place every year. And botched abortions are the leading cause of maternal death there. Last week, thousands of demonstrators took to the streets in Buenos Aires and other cities, calling for abortion to be legalized as the political winds there have shifted. To tell us more, we have Natalie Alcoba in Buenos Aires on the line. She reported on the demonstrations for Al-Jazeera. Welcome. NATALIE ALCOBA: Hi, Lulu. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Hi. This has been a long fight for these activists. The latest attempt to legalize abortion got close in 2018, but it ultimately failed in the Senate. You report that activists are more optimistic now. Why? ALCOBA: Yeah. Yeah, that's right. So last week was a return to the streets for the campaign to legalize abortion in Argentina. The last time we saw the feminist movement come out in these kinds of numbers was in May of last year when they actually did present a new project to legalize abortion in the first 14 weeks. It was never debated last year because it was an election year. And I guess that is the crucial piece that has changed since 2018 because now Argentina has a president, Alberto Fernandez, who is pro-legalization, pro-decriminalizing abortion and is drafting a bill to present to the Congress. GARCIA-NAVARRO: So you reported on the demonstrations. What were the women on the streets there telling you about why they're out? And did you hear any personal stories? ALCOBA: Yeah. So, I mean, I was out last year when they presented their project and then again last week. You know, I talked to mothers who were there with their daughters, some very young. I know one mother who's there with her 5-year-old. Last year, when I was out at one of the demonstrations, I spoke to a teenager who talked about how after the debate in 2018, you know, she recalled this one instance when she was watching television with her mom, and it was a news item about the question of legalizing abortion. And following that item, her mother kind of opened up to her and confided that when she was a teenager, she had sought an illegal abortion. And she had felt alone and didn't know who to turn to for help. GARCIA-NAVARRO: We should say abortion in Argentina is not only illegal, but it can lead to prison time, right? ALCOBA: That's correct. Yeah, yeah. It comes with a sentence of between one and three years. I mean, the reality is that it is seldom - at this stage, it is seldom prosecuted. And I think that's one of the main reasons why the president, Alberto Fernandez, talks about the hypocrisy that exists here in Argentina, this idea that two tiers - two classes of women, right? - that if you're wealthy, you can access something that is safe. And if you're not, then you can't. And that really drives his own position on legalizing it. GARCIA-NAVARRO: One of the main groups opposing legalization is, of course, the Catholic Church. This is the home country, after all, of Pope Francis, who personally got involved in the debate last time. What has the religious community and others who oppose abortion been saying this time? ALCOBA: Yes, I think we are hearing that same message. And I think that the influence of the Catholic Church is the main reason why this will be a stiff debate. It seems to me at least that they're taking an even more visible role. Like, for example, that the church has called a special mass for March 8, which is International Women's Day, in a basilica in the city of Lujan. It's a mass that is in defense of both lives - that's the terminology that they use - and that really is meant to show, you know, the opposition to abortion. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Well, there's still a lot of opposition in the Senate to this, which means this bill might not pass yet again. I mean, what are the expectations at this point? ALCOBA: Yeah, so I think that the gap between the yes and the no side in the Senate has shrunk. But it does appear to tilt no at the moment. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Natalie Alcoba is a reporter in Buenos Aires. Thank you so much. ALCOBA: Thank you, Lulu. Copyright \u00a9 2020 NPR.  All rights reserved.

She has announced a new PAC to back progressive congressional candidates.\n                \n                    \n                    Gene J. Puskar/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., speaks during a rally for Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., in Iowa last month. She has announced a new PAC to back progressive congressional candidates. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who gained an instant national profile when she toppled a top Democratic leader in 2018, has launched her own political action committee to boost challengers in 2020 congressional races. The move shows the 30-year-old New York freshman's intentions to continue battling with her party's establishment. Ocasio-Cortez unveiled the website for her group \u2014 dubbed \"Courage to Change\" \u2014 along with a slate of seven endorsements for female candidates who in some cases are competing against other Democrats backed by party campaign committees. Although her latest project showcases her willingness to clash with her own leadership, Ocasio-Cortez' name recognition and regular turns on national media outlets could help attract more money from people new to politics at a time when the 2020 presidential contest is the major focus for many regular party donors. Her new group's mission statement says it \"seeks to reward challengers and incumbents who display political courage \u2014 people who refuse to bow to establishment pressure, who advocate ferociously for working-class families, and who have lived the same struggles as the people they seek to represent.\" Ocasio-Cortez discussed her plans first in an interview with the New York Times. It\u2019s time to elect a progressive majority in Congress accountable to strong, grassroots movements that push support for issues like Medicare for All, a Green New Deal, racial justice, & more.It\u2019s time to elect public servants with the Courage to Change: https://t.co/K6JXmCH2Vh Ocasio-Cortez touted House and Senate candidates who haven't served in Congress before; five are women of color. Cristina Tzintz\u00fan Ramirez, who is running for Senate in Texas, is competing against MJ Hegar, a combat veteran who is backed by the Senate Democrats' campaign arm. The others \u2014 Jessica Cisneros of Texas, Georgette Gomez of California, Samelys Lopez of New York, Kara Eastman of Nebraska, Marie Newman of Illinois and Teresa Leger Fernandez of New Mexico \u2014 are running in House races. Two are running against current House Democratic incumbents \u2014 Cisneros is attempting to beat Texas Rep. Henry Cuellar, a moderate eight-term member who stresses his appeal to independents and Republicans. Newman is running for the second time against Illinois Rep. Dan Lipinski, also serving his eighth term, who some liberals have criticized for his anti-abortion rights voting record. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee declined to comment on the new PAC. House Democrats are encouraged to pay dues to help support their colleagues to the House Democrats' campaign arm, but Ocasio-Cortez has not paid hers this election cycle. The DCCC has boasted about its record-breaking fundraising this cycle \u2014 bringing in $125 million in 2019, a more than $20 million increase than it raised in 2017. It's unclear how much money the new progressive PAC will dole out \u2014 Rolling Stone reports so far it has raised $340,000 in the last month. It's not uncommon for House lawmakers to set up their own political action committees to focus on helping particular candidates. For example, Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass., touts \"Serve America\" PAC that focuses on incumbents and challengers with military or intelligence community backgrounds. Many of those backed by that committee won in 2018. Ocasio-Cortez gained prominence along with fellow freshman members of the \"squad\" \u2014 Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib, Massachusetts Rep. Ayanna Pressley, and Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar. President Trump has repeatedly criticized Ocasio-Cortez in his campaign speeches, further elevating her profile. The group has been the focus of several intra-party squabbles about policy priorities and political ideology since they started serving in the House in January 2019. After beating Democratic Rep. Joe Crowley, who chaired the Democratic caucus and had plans to run for speaker, Ocasio-Cortez has argued the caucus needed to elect more outsiders who aren't beholden to party leaders or donors. Last fall Ocasio-Cortez told NPR's Steve Inskeep why she was backing some challengers to some of her own colleagues in the House. \"We have to be very careful about where the balance of the party is,\" she said, adding, \"I think we need to take progressives in the party as seriously as we're taking conservatives in the party.\" Democrats took control of the House after the 2018 midterms by knocking off Republicans in suburban and exurban districts \u2014 and the focus on keeping the majority in 2020 has been largely concentrated on helping those 31 Democrats who won in districts that Trump won in 2016.",

            "article_content": "Lawmakers in Kansas want to change the state's constitution so abortion is not protected. Three other states \u2014 Tennessee, Alabama and West Virginia \u2014 have already changed their constitutions.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: People in Kansas want voters to decide if women have a fundamental right to abortion. If a ballot measure finds they do not have that right, the state would become the fourth in the country, following Tennessee, Alabama and West Virginia, to change its constitution so abortion is not protected. Here's Celia Llopis-Jepsen the Kansas News Service. CELIA LLOPIS-JEPSEN, BYLINE: The Kansas Bill of Rights says that everyone has inalienable rights. It's there in the state's constitution. And the Kansas Supreme Court last year ruled that means residents control their own bodies, including the right to an abortion. That ruling was a win for abortion rights advocates. But anti-abortion groups fear the state's current restrictions on abortion could be struck down unless that right is stripped from the constitution - things like a general ban on abortion after 22 weeks of pregnancy. Some religious groups and others are lobbying for an amendment to the constitution. They organized letter writing campaigns, petitions and prayer. JOHN HOLECEK: Our Lady of Guadalupe, patroness of the unborn, we implore your powerful intercession at this most critical of times. Now that the Kansas Supreme Court has completely removed pro-life protections... LLOPIS-JEPSEN: John Holecek is coordinating a statewide rosary crusade to recite prayers like this one. HOLECEK: I don't think it's a slam dunk by any means - although Kansas has a reputation of being pro-life - that it would necessarily pass. LLOPIS-JEPSEN: Earlier this week, the Senate voted to put the change to the constitution up for public vote. The House could vote as soon as next week. Chuck Weber lobbies on behalf of the state's four Catholic bishops and urges lawmakers to support this measure. CHUCK WEBER: You can be pro-choice as a legislator and still say, you know what, the American way is to decide things at the ballot box, and so I'm going to let the people of my district decide this question for themselves. LLOPIS-JEPSEN: Those pushing the amendment want to get it on the August primary ballot here, and abortion rights supporters are crying foul. They argue that more Kansans will likely turn out for the presidential election in November and not the primary, which tends to turn out more conservative Republican voters. Surveys here suggest that while most Kansas residents do want some level of restrictions on abortion, a majority want it to remain legal. Abortion rights advocates are calling supporters... LESLIE BUTSCH: Hi. Is Dolores (ph) there? LLOPIS-JEPSEN: ...And asking them to reach out to legislators. BUTSCH: So I'm actually calling to see if you or Dolores would call Representative Pittman and ask him to vote no on the constitutional amendment. LLOPIS-JEPSEN: Planned Parenthood Great Plains Votes is the group's advocacy arm. RACHEL SWEET: Everyone deserves protection under the constitution. LLOPIS-JEPSEN: Rachel Sweet is their lobbyist. SWEET: Even if you are in the minority, you are a woman who is seeking abortion, your rights should not be dependent on a vote of your peers just because they might disagree with your decision. LLOPIS-JEPSEN: When Alabama voters approved a similar amendment to their constitution, the legislature there passed a near-total abortion ban, a measure that remains tied up in court. But when Senate Republicans in Kansas voted this week to allow a referendum on changing the constitution, they argued that nothing in the amendment's wording is a ban in itself. Planned Parenthood fears change in the constitution would be the first step toward making abortion illegal in the state. For NPR News, I'm Celia Llopis-Jepsen. Copyright \u00a9 2020 NPR.

President Trump spoke at this year's rally on Friday.\n                \n                    \n                    Jose Luis Magana/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Anti-abortion rights activists march toward the U.S. Supreme Court during the 2019 March for Life in Washington, D.C. President Trump spoke at this year's rally on Friday. Updated at 4:45 p.m. ET As thousands of anti-abortion rights activists prepared to march in Washington, D.C., on Friday, President Trump was there to rally his base. \"They are coming after me, because I am fighting for you,\" Trump told the crowd, without directly mentioning the impeachment trial underway in the Senate. \"And we are fighting for those who have no voice.\" \"And we will win,\" Trump added, \"because we know how to win.\" It was the first time a sitting president delivered an address in person at the March for Life, an annual event organized decades ago in response to the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion nationwide. #MarchForLife https://t.co/5Yg09dOoJd Trump's appearance before thousands of mostly supportive anti-abortion rights activists comes at a key moment \u2014 during the impeachment trial, and just months to go before the 2020 election. Trump has leaned in to his connection to religious and social conservatives, frequently praising \"the evangelicals\" who make up a key portion of his base and courting anti-abortion rights groups such as the Susan B. Anthony List. At the march, that group's president, Marjorie Dannenfelser, made an explicit plea for support for Trump, calling the 2020 election \"the most consequential election of our lifetimes for the cause of the unborn.\" \"We have seen historic gains under this President. You heard what his heart his and what his track record is,\" Dannefelser said. She added, \"But now it's time to go for the win,\" calling for the overturning of Roe v. Wade and for passage of federal legislation restricting abortion. In an interview with NPR ahead of the march, Dannenfelser called Trump's appearance at the march \"a moment of celebration for the pro-life movement.\" She said it's a reminder of how far Trump has come in the minds of some conservatives who were initially skeptical because of his past support for abortion rights. \"Everyone doubted where he was on the abortion issue. He stated what he believed. There were doubts all over \u2014 I mean, I was one of them,\" Dannenfelser said. \"So he's actually become the person that he says he is.\" Dannenfelser said she is pleased with Trump's appointment of conservative federal judges \u2014 most notably to the Supreme Court. Just this week, the Trump administration signed off on federal funding for a family planning program in Texas that excludes groups like Planned Parenthood that provide abortion services. \"No one in that crowd needs persuading, but everyone in that crowd needs reminding what's at stake this coming election,\" Dannenfelser said. \"It won't be a cajoling and a persuasion moment; it will be a momentum moment.\" Several marchers told NPR that while they have had some misgivings about Trump, they are pleased with his record on issues including abortion. \"He's a little rough around the edges, but he stands for the things that I believe in, and that's why I voted for him,\" said Ermida Arocho of Chicago. June Matson, who runs a crisis pregnancy center in Granby, Colorado where women are counseled against abortion, alluded to Trump's history of once expressing support for abortions rights. \"Whether he was pro-life before or not, it doesn't really matter, because he has continued to prove that he will vote pro-life,\" Matson said. Trump's appearance wasn't entirely unprecedented: Two years ago, he spoke live via video feed from the White House Rose Garden, telling that marchers, \"you love every child, born and unborn, because you believe that every life is sacred, that every child is a precious gift from God.\" Other Republican presidents \u2014 Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush \u2014 have addressed the crowd remotely, via phone call or prepared statement. Some observers have speculated that such a move allowed those presidents to court anti-abortion rights voters without subjecting themselves to a photo-op in front of the crowd, out of fear of turning off more moderate voters. The Trump administration took the occasion to announce an action aimed at appealing to anti-abortion voters; the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services told California that a law requiring insurance companies to include abortion coverage in all healthcare plans violates federal law, and gave the state 30 days to rescind it. California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said on twitter that the president is \"sowing division for cheap political gain,\" and pledged to fight to preserve the law. Make no mistake, this attack on California is just one more attempt to chip away at reproductive rights and access to abortion. We will fight this by any means necessary. #ExpandNotBan https://t.co/xuzwQJOpsb Reproductive rights groups are using Trump's appearance at the March for Life to remind their supporters of his opposition to abortion rights. NARAL Pro-Choice America President Ilyse Hogue issued a statement calling Trump's decision to appear at the March for Life an \"act of desperation.\" In an interview with NPR, Planned Parenthood's acting president and CEO, Alexis McGill Johnson, said Trump's appearance at the event is \"no surprise\" given his policy record. \"This is just confirmation that we have a sitting president of the United States who is determined to do whatever he can to end people's ability to access abortion,\" McGill Johnson said. Advocates on both sides of the abortion debate see much at stake in the 2020 election. After Trump's address, activists at the rally will march from the National Mall to the U.S. Supreme Court \u2014 where just weeks from now, the court is set to take up its first major abortion case since Trump's two conservatives nominees, Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, joined the bench. Those two justices alone have moved the court to the right, setting up the possibility that Roe could be overturned or substantially eroded. And whoever is elected in November may have the opportunity to name at least one more justice to the court.",

            "article_content": "Tennessee's senators have long had a reputation of being independent-minded. But in the state's upcoming GOP primary, both main candidates have vowed to stick close to President Trump.  RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: OK, we're going to focus here back at home and politics. There is a Republican primary in Tennessee to replace Sen. Lamar Alexander. The two candidates have been fighting over who is more loyal to President Trump. The race reflects a steady evolution of the Republican Party in that state. Sergio Mart\u00ednez-Beltr\u00e1n of member station WPLN reports. SERGIO MART\u00cdNEZ-BELTR\u00c1N, BYLINE: In one corner is Trump's former U.S. Ambassador to Japan Bill Hagerty. The 60-year-old businessman is the president's favorite in this race. Trump announced Hagerty's candidacy even while he was still a diplomat. Hagerty has used his close relationship as an advantage. BILL HAGERTY: I just got off the phone with President Trump a little while ago. He and I have seen many issues the same way for a long time. MART\u00cdNEZ-BELTR\u00c1N: But one challenge for Hagerty is that he has been close to some of Trump's biggest adversaries within the GOP. In 2012, he worked for Mitt Romney's then-presidential campaign. And in 2016, Hagerty and his wife, Chrissy, appeared on the ballot as delegates for another presidential candidate, Jeb Bush. Hagerty then joined Trump's campaign. HAGERTY: I believed in candidate Trump so much then that I took six months of my life and volunteered full-time to come in and help him get elected. MART\u00cdNEZ-BELTR\u00c1N: One of the people who has questioned Hagerty's past is his main opponent, Manny Sethi. The orthopedic trauma surgeon otherwise doesn't seem to have any policy disagreement with Hagerty. Out on the stump, he attacks Planned Parenthood and Black Lives Matter protesters. He supports Trump's hard-line views on immigration. That's even though his own parents are from India. He stresses they came to the U.S. legally. Sethi runs his nonprofit, Healthy Tennessee, and says that experience pulled him into politics. MANNY SETHI: Now, the president heard about this - President Trump - so he invited us to the White House. And he couldn't remember Manny, so he nicknamed me Tennessee. True story. I spoke at one of his rallies. Look, folks; we have got to stand behind our president right now more than ever. MART\u00cdNEZ-BELTR\u00c1N: Sethi's main message is that out of the two candidates, he is the outsider. SETHI: We are taking on the establishment, ladies and gentlemen. I need all of you with us. MART\u00cdNEZ-BELTR\u00c1N: Hagerty and Sethi are running to replace retiring Sen. Lamar Alexander, and how both have embraced President Trump is a reflection on how the Tennessee Republican Party has evolved. The state has been a breeding ground for centrist Republicans seeking higher office, such as Alexander and former Senators Howard Baker and Bob Corker. Tom Ingram oversaw the winning gubernatorial and Senate campaigns of Alexander. TOM INGRAM: We used to say when Lamar got elected governor that he got elected by grace of the Democrats. We had to take about a third of the Democratic vote away from a Democratic opponent to win those elections then. MART\u00cdNEZ-BELTR\u00c1N: But that's not the case anymore. Now Republicans have a supermajority in Tennessee, and candidates are mostly trying to satisfy their base. Ingram says he hopes whoever becomes the nominee understands that that might not work in the long term. INGRAM: It's going to be incumbent on whoever the next senator is to hopefully put the campaign behind them and focus on serving the people and drop all the partisanship. MART\u00cdNEZ-BELTR\u00c1N: While Tennessee's past senators have had a reputation for being independent-minded, both Hagerty and Sethi have vowed to stand with the president at all times.

Now a senator, Loeffler faces a political challenge over her stake in the WNBA franchise in a tough election race. Sports, race and politics have come together to create a political challenge for Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler of Georgia, who co-owns the Atlanta Dream, the city's WNBA team. Loeffler, who's facing a tough election this fall, has drawn scrutiny for calling on the league's commissioner to drop support of the Black Lives Matter movement. The WNBA and its union have decided to put \"Black Lives Matter\" and \"Say Her Name\" slogans on warmup gear and opening weekend team uniforms. \"The truth is, we need less \u2014 not more politics in sports,\" Loeffler wrote in a letter to WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert last week. \"In a time when polarizing politics is as divisive as ever, sports has the power to be a unifying antidote.\" \"There is no room for racism in this country. We cannot have it,\" Loeffler went on to say of her stance at a campaign stop in Winder, Ga. \"But there is an organization, different from the saying, an organization called Black Lives Matter founded on Marxist principles. Marxism supports socialism.\" Engelbert rejected the appeal, saying the league will \"continue to use our platforms to vigorously advocate for social justice.\" The players union, the WNBPA, has demanded Loeffler be removed as an owner of the Atlanta Dream. \"I think it's a really uninformed, political, reactive statement that divides our country and in a league that has always sought tolerance, it's pretty shocking,\" Loeffler said of the reaction from the league. Loeffler became a senator in January, replacing retiring Sen. Johnny Isakson, and she previously was a financial services executive. She said she's standing up for free speech and for people who feel attacked for voicing conservative beliefs. That's a message that is resonating, said Georgia Public Service Commissioner Tim Echols, who has endorsed Loeffler. \"I think a lot of Republicans are very sympathetic to the attack that's being placed on her right now, and I think this has helped her,\" Echols said. \"Kelly has had the courage to be able to stand up, and I think Republicans are giving her some credit for that.\" The entire Atlanta Dream roster split with Loeffler over supporting Black Lives Matter. Elizabeth Williams has played on the Dream since 2016 and serves on the union's executive committee. \"It's clear that [Loeffler is] trying to use the idea of Black Lives Matter and politicizing it for her gain. And that's on her if that's what she wants to do,\" she said. \"But I think at the end of the day the movement and what we as players stand for is a movement of unity, a movement of justice.\" Williams called it \"disappointing\" to read Loeffler's statements, especially because the league is made up of about 80% Black women. \"I think it's ironic for her to make these statements and for her to still want to be associated with the team,\" Williams said. Loeffler maintains she won't back away from her ownership stake despite the blowback. \"The only option the Loeffler campaign had\" While Loeffler argued that her stand was about removing politics from sports, it's difficult to ignore the context in which it's happening. Loeffler's ownership stake in the team has become a campaign liability as U.S. Rep. Doug Collins, her best-known Republican opponent, has mined it repeatedly for political attacks. \"It's really the only option the Loeffler campaign had,\" said Brian Robinson, a Georgia Republican strategist and communications consultant of the move. She \"had to go on defense and to try to block off that line of attack from Doug Collins,\" he said. Collins' campaign has called out a past Dream game that allowed fans to donate a portion of ticket proceeds to Planned Parenthood, and for a past game honoring former gubernatorial Democratic candidate Stacey Abrams Robinson said Loeffler also had to go on the offensive to win over Georgia's Republican base, because while she is in a free-for-all, \"jungle\" special election without party primaries, she needs the state's loyal Republican voters in November. \"The culture war right now is a huge dividing line between the left and the right, between Democrats and Republicans, and both sides have got to pick sides with the other side,\" he said. \"This presented her an opportunity to go on offense and to pick a fight with a group that's on the other side of the partisan divide, the other side of the culture divide.\" The November race is effectively two party primaries combined, Robinson argued, with a final runoff contest likely in January. Under Georgia's special election rules, a candidate must win more than 50% of the vote to avoid a runoff. Loeffler faces 20 opponents, and a runoff between the top two vote-getters is almost certain. \"The Republicans will pick their candidate, and the Democrats will pick theirs,\" Robinson said. \"Let's be serious \u2014 this is not a general, this is really a primary by a different name.\" After November, the race will more than likely become about winning over the state's independent voters, Robinson said.",

With the death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the ACA's future is in doubt. The death of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has raised the profile of a case that marks the latest existential threat to the Affordable Care Act. The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear the case the week after the general election in November. Democrats are raising alarms about the future of the law without Ginsburg. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, speaking on ABC's This Week Sunday morning, said that part of the strategy by President Trump and Senate Republicans to quickly fill Ginsburg's seat is to help undermine the ACA. \"The president is rushing to make some kind of a decision because ... Nov. 10 is when the arguments begin on the Affordable Care Act,\" Pelosi said. \"He doesn't want to crush the virus. He wants to crush the Affordable Care Act.\" Among other things, the Affordable Care Act now dangles from a thread. Nicholas Bagley, law professor, University of Michigan Ginsburg's death throws an already chaotic general election campaign during a pandemic into more turmoil. But in the longer term, her absence from the bench could accelerate a trend underway to get certain cases to the Supreme Court with the aim of invalidating the ACA. The ACA under fire \u2014 again A coalition of Republican state attorneys general, led by Texas, argued in February 2018 that the Republican-backed tax-cut law of December 2017 had rendered the ACA unconstitutional by reducing to zero the ACA's penalty for not having insurance. They based their argument on Chief Justice John Roberts' 2012 conclusion that the ACA was valid, interpreting that penalty as a constitutionally appropriate tax. Most legal scholars, including several who challenged the law before the Supreme Court in 2012 and again in 2015, find unconvincing the argument that the entire law should fall. \"If courts invalidate an entire law merely because Congress eliminates or revises one part, as happened here, that may well inhibit necessary reform of federal legislation in the future by turning it into an 'all or nothing' proposition,\" wrote a group of conservative and liberal law professors in a brief filed in the case. Still, in December 2018, U.S. District Judge Reed O'Connor in Texas accepted the GOP argument and declared the law unconstitutional. In December 2019, a three-judge 5th Circuit appeals court panel in New Orleans agreed that without the penalty the requirement to buy insurance is unconstitutional. But it sent the case back to O'Connor to suggest that perhaps the entire law need not fall. Not wanting to wait the months or years that reconsideration would take, Democratic attorneys general defending the ACA asked the Supreme Court to hear the case this year. (Democrats are defending the law in court because the Trump administration decided to support the case from the GOP attorneys general.) The court agreed to take the case but scheduled arguments for the week after the November election. While the fate of the ACA was, and is, a live political issue, few legal observers have been terribly worried about the legal outcome of the case now known as California v. Texas, if only because the case seemed much weaker than the 2012 and 2015 cases in which Roberts joined the court's four liberals. In the 2015 case, which challenged the validity of federal tax subsidies helping millions of Americans buy health insurance on the ACA's marketplaces, both Roberts and now-retired Justice Anthony Kennedy voted to uphold the law. 20 million Americans could immediately lose health coverage But without Ginsburg, the case could wind up in a 4-4 tie, even if Roberts supports the law's constitutionality. That could let the lower-court ruling stand, although it would not be binding on other courts outside the 5th Circuit. The court could also put off the arguments or, if the Republican Senate replaces Ginsburg with another conservative justice before arguments are heard, Republicans could secure a 5-4 ruling against the law. Some court observers argue that Justice Brett Kavanaugh has not favored invalidating an entire statute if only part of it is flawed and might not approve overturning the ACA. Still, what started out as an effort to energize Republican voters for the 2018 midterms after Congress failed to \"repeal and replace\" the health law in 2017 could end up throwing the nation's entire health system into chaos. At least 20 million Americans \u2014 and likely many more who sought coverage since the start of the coronavirus pandemic \u2014 who buy insurance through the ACA marketplaces or have Medicaid through the law's expansion could lose health coverage right away. Many millions more would lose the law's popular protections that guarantee coverage for people with preexisting health conditions, including those who have had COVID-19. Adult children under age 26 would no longer be guaranteed the right to remain on their parents' health plans, and Medicare patients would lose enhanced prescription drug coverage. Women would lose guaranteed access to birth control at no out-of-pocket cost. But a sudden elimination would affect more than just patients. Insurance companies, drug companies, hospitals and doctors all have changed the way they do business because of incentives and penalties in the health law. If it's struck down, many of the \"rules of the road\" would be wiped away, including billing and payment mechanisms. A new Democratic president could not drop the lawsuit, because the Trump administration is not the plaintiff (the GOP attorneys general are). But a Democratic Congress and president could in theory make the entire issue go away by reinstating the penalty for failure to have insurance, even at a minimal amount. For now, however, nothing is a sure thing as far as the health law goes. As Nicholas Bagley, a law professor at the University of Michigan who specializes in health issues, tweeted: \"Among other things, the Affordable Care Act now dangles from a thread.\" Julie Rovner is senior Washington correspondent for Kaiser Health News.

Alicia Aguiano drove down to Washington, D.C., from Philadelphia this weekend to pay her respects to Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. As she stood in front of the Supreme Court building, with its sidewalk covered in flowers and chalk tributes to Ginsburg, her voice quavered and she wiped at tears. \"I've just been super inspired by her. I really identify with her,\" she said. \"I'm a lawyer, and I also teach at a law school. And so I fully recognize that I wouldn't be where I am if it weren't for her, and so I just felt the need to come down and pay my respects.\" Aguiano had come down in part to attend a Saturday night vigil honoring the Supreme Court justice, who died Friday night. The vigil \u2014 hosted by a variety of activist groups, including the Women's March, Planned Parenthood Action Fund, and MoveOn Political Action \u2014 was part memorial service, part political rally. The crowd held candles as they listened to speakers celebrate Ginsburg's advances for women's rights, and also to exhort attendees to vote President Trump out of office.

Days before she died, she dictated a statement to her granddaughter to that effect, as NPR's Nina Totenberg reported: \"My most fervent wish is that I will not be replaced until a new president is installed.\" (The White House is expected to name a replacement for Ginsburg as early as this week.) There was a sense among some attendees that yes, they planned to vote against Trump, and yes, many planned to donate or volunteer (or both), but that Ginsburg's death has turned up their sense of urgency from an 11 to a 13. \"It's easy to watch the protesters walk by. It's easy to sort of let things go past you and support it silently,\" said Rachael Blumenberg, who lives in Washington, and attended with her mother, sister and daughter. \"But I don't think we have the luxury of doing that anymore.\" Mourners laid flowers and signs at the vigil.\n                \n                    \n                    Cheryl Diaz Meyer for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Mourners laid flowers and signs at the vigil.

President Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., already had remade the federal judiciary before the hinge of fate swung again on Friday night. The Republican-controlled Senate has confirmed no fewer than 200 federal judges, many of them young, and each to a lifelong term, as NPR's Carrie Johnson has reported. Two of those jurists included Supreme Court justices \u2014 Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh \u2014 and the death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg now means that Trump can nominate a third. McConnell said on Friday night he intends to convene a vote on that nominee in the Senate, potentially before Election Day or Inauguration Day in January. Conservative legal activists couldn't be happier about McConnell's project, which not only stocks lower-level federal courts with judges they believe will interpret the law in a way they support, but also creates a vast pool from which Trump now could select for a Supreme Court nominee. \"Filling all of these circuit seats is an unmitigated success, no downside to that,\" Carrie Severino, who leads the Judicial Crisis Network, told NPR's Johnson. Here's a breakdown from last summer about the judges Trump has nominated and McConnell has led to confirmation in the Senate. The corps of judges now in place means conservatives hope for a body of rulings that match their perspectives on key issues, including on reproductive rights, environmental issues, voting cases and more. Plus the comparatively young age of the population of judges \u2014 some in their 30s and 40s \u2014 mean they'll be on the bench for decades. Democrats accuse McConnell of a cynical scheme: he blocked judicial nominees under President Obama to create a surplus of vacancies, which he then was able to fill with the arrival of a Republican president. Other critics also noted to NPR's Johnson how mostly male and mostly white were the judges of the Trump-McConnell era. Vanita Gupta, who runs the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, said this of the cadre: \"It is an astonishing lack of representation.\"",

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo launched another broadside against China this week, warning of Chinese threats to U.S. research universities. \"Americans must know how the Chinese Communist Party is poisoning the well of our higher education institutions for its own ends, and how those actions degrade our freedoms and American national security,\" he said in a speech Wednesday at Georgia Tech in Atlanta. Pompeo accused China's Communist Party of trying to \"steal our stuff and pressure critics to keep quiet.\" It was a reprise of a favorite theme for Pompeo, who has used recent speeches and interviews to burnish his image as tough on China and Iran. His choice of venue, though, is drawing criticism, taking place less than a month before key runoff races in Georgia that will determine which party controls the U.S. Senate. Pompeo's critics see his trip to Georgia at a politically tense moment for the state as another example of America's top diplomat breaking norms by getting involved in domestic politics. \"Secretary Pompeo's lasting mark on American foreign policy is the extent to which he politicized the State Department and the conduct of American foreign policy and made it a part of advancing his own domestic political interests,\" said Tamara Cofman Wittes of the Brookings Institution. Pompeo, who has presidential ambitions and is considered a contender for the Republican nomination in 2024, has used State Department resources to network, she said. Congressional Democrats are looking into the \"Madison Dinners\" \u2014 taxpayer-funded private functions \u2014 that Pompeo and his wife, Susan Pompeo, hosted for Republican donors and supporters at a cost of at least $45,000, according to receipts obtained by the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. Pompeo brushes off the criticism. Answering questions following his Georgia Tech speech, he insisted his trip was not about partisanship. \"I don't think a single thing I said today reflected a partisan viewpoint, but rather relied on a dataset,\" Pompeo told students. The moderator did not ask him to comment on the Georgia Senate runoffs or his controversial remark last month that \"there will be a smooth transition to a second Trump administration,\" in which he amplified President Trump's baseless claims about the U.S. election results. Pompeo's readiness to wade into political waters was on full display in his recent trip to Israel, where he visited a West Bank settlement and an evangelical Christian museum, stops that can boost his appeal among fellow evangelicals. When Pompeo first arrived at the State Department in April 2018, some veteran U.S. diplomats hoped his close relations with Trump would mean that after the previous year of cutbacks under Rex Tillerson, the State Department was back in the game. \"They may have been demoralized, but they seemed in good spirits,\" Pompeo told reporters after meeting American diplomats in Brussels at the U.S. mission to NATO, on his first trip as secretary of state. \"They are hopeful that the State Department will get its swagger back, that we will be out doing the things that they came onboard at the State Department to do. To be professional, to deliver diplomacy, American diplomacy around the world \u2013 that's my mission set, is to build that esprit and get the team on the field so that we can effectuate American diplomacy.\" His close ties to Trump often came at a cost to that team, though. Pompeo refused to support Marie Yovanovitch, the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine who was ousted in 2019 after a smear campaign by Trump's personal attorney, Rudy  Giuliani. More recently, Pompeo left his ambassadors with no talking points on the U.S. election results after his controversial remark about a \"second Trump administration.\" Pompeo counts his work against abortion rights as one of his major achievements as secretary of state. During his tenure, the administration expanded what is known as the global gag rule to block all funding to organizations overseas that provide abortion counseling or services. In October, Pompeo signed an anti-abortion declaration with countries including Belarus, Hungary, Egypt, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia. \"We continued our unprecedented defense of the unborn by signing the Geneva Consensus Declaration alongside 32 other nations,\" he told reporters in November. \"I'm especially proud that we've made religious freedom a top priority in the United States foreign policy for the first time in America's history.\" Rori Kramer, a former State Department official, worries that some civil liberties may be curbed in the name of religious freedom. She points to the latest international conference on religious freedom, which was hosted in Poland, \"a country that has LGBTQ-free zones,\" she said, \"that has basically banned all reproductive access.\" The State Department launched the annual gatherings and worked closely with Poland on this year's event. Kramer, who is now with the American Jewish World Service, believes Pompeo has been pushing his religious beliefs to \"degrade the rights of women, girls and LGBTQ people.\" He stripped the State Department's annual human rights reports of any mention of reproductive rights for women. And the Commission on Unalienable Rights, which he set up in 2019 to address his concerns about a \"proliferation of rights,\" put greater emphasis on property rights and religious freedom than other rights. \"When I worked at the State Department, we didn't infuse politics and religion into policy, in particular into universal human rights. And so now the State Department staff has been asked to make basic human rights of others into a domestic political issue,\" Kramer said. She expects the Biden administration to reject some of these policies. Trump's envoy on religious freedom, Sam Brownback, though, told reporters recently he's hoping Pompeo's emphasis on religious freedom will outlive his tenure as secretary of state.",

            "article_content": "The Senate is expected to confirm Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court on Monday in a mostly party-line vote. Her addition to the court days before the election has been a campaign issue.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: Judge Amy Coney Barrett has been confirmed to the U.S. Supreme Court. The Senate voted this evening, with Democrats reiterating their objections to the move, but Republicans ultimately had the votes they needed. To tell us more, we're joined by NPR congressional reporter Claudia Grisales. Hi, Claudia. CLAUDIA GRISALES, BYLINE: Hi, Ari. SHAPIRO: How did the vote break down tonight? GRISALES: It was 52-48, almost entirely along party lines. Maine GOP Senator Susan Collins, who said the vote on the vacancy shouldn't happen this close to the presidential election, joined Democrats to oppose the nomination. Still, Republicans had a comfortable margin. They needed at least 50, with Vice President Mike Pence breaking a tie. But his vote wasn't needed. And although he indicated he wanted to be here, he didn't preside after several of his aides tested positive for COVID-19, and he was urged to stay away by Democrats. And while it's traditional for all members to vote from their seats in these cases, you could only see Republicans remain in the chamber. Democrats only entered momentarily to vote because of the pandemic and also a sign of how partisan this process was. SHAPIRO: And after the Senate voted, Barrett appeared at the White House. Tell us what happened there tonight. GRISALES: Right. Justice Clarence Thomas administered a constitutional oath to Judge Barrett tonight. That was one of two that the justices are required to take. This took place outdoors. It was a much more socially distanced and masked crowd than previous events. About a dozen Senate Republicans were in attendance. But it's not immediately clear when and where a separate judicial oath for Barrett is expected to take place. SHAPIRO: This has been such a partisan process, as you mentioned. And before the vote tonight, both parties took one final opportunity to get in their say. Tell us what we heard from them. GRISALES: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell spoke for about 20 minutes on the floor tonight. He stressed that there has been a lot at stake here, lamenting the partisanship. Let's take a listen. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MITCH MCCONNELL: Elections come and go. Political power is never permanent, but the consequences could be cataclysmic if our colleagues across the aisle let partisan passions boil over and scorch the ground rules of our government. GRISALES: He said Republicans are exercising the power that was given to them by the American people. And in a different era, Barrett may have won bipartisan support. And moments before the vote, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer made his final objection. Let's take a listen. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CHUCK SCHUMER: Monday, October 26, 2020 - it will go down as one of the darkest days in the 231-year history of the United States Senate. GRISALES: He reiterated Democrats' argument that Republicans rammed this nomination through with early voting already underway. Republicans have refused this practice in the past. But Democrats didn't have many tools at their disposal to stop this, so they used this opportunity to highlight concerns about health care, reproductive and voting rights. And that includes the Affordable Care Act, which will be before the Supreme Court just one week after the election. SHAPIRO: And what does Barrett's confirmation mean for the Supreme Court? GRISALES: Barrett still needs to be administered the judicial oath. As we mentioned, tonight's was the constitutional oath. And we should note - a White House event announcing her nomination was just one month ago today, and that turned out to be a superspreader event. So again, today's event was much smaller. But still, Republicans are using this to highlight this accomplishment of approving her so quickly. It's one of the fastest confirmations in history and an opportunity to shift the court with Barrett to a 6-3 conservative majority. And they're doing this despite no cooperation from Democrats and a pandemic. SHAPIRO: NPR congressional reporter Claudia Grisales, thanks a lot. GRISALES: Thanks for having me.

Barrett will not be present. Republicans will call on Amanda Rauh-Bieri, a former law clerk for Barrett on the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals, and Laura Wolk, the first blind woman to clerk on the U.S. Supreme Court and who has called Barrett her mentor. They'll also hear from former appeals court Judge Thomas Griffith, whose retirement this year caused a controversy when a liberal group alleged that he stepped down from the bench to allow President Trump to appoint a replacement before the election. Democrats have invited several advocates to speak.  Stacy Staggs, a mother of 7-year-old twins, is one of them. According to a statement released by ranking Judiciary Committee member Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif, Staggs \"will discuss the devastating effects on her family if the Supreme Court overturns the Affordable Care Act.\" Democrats also invited Crystal Good, who \"fought for her right to obtain an abortion at age 16. Crystal will speak about the importance of reproductive rights and justice.\" The Judiciary Committee is expected to vote Oct. 22 on Barrett's nomination, as Republicans press to confirm her in the full Senate before the Nov. 3 presidential election. \"You will be confirmed, God willing,\" Judiciary Committee Chairman Sen.

McConnell made the case on the Senate floor that voters elected a GOP majority to confirm judicial nominees. Updated at 7:58 p.m. ET Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell reiterated his plans to move forward on President Trump's nominee to fill the vacancy on the U.S. Supreme Court left by the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. \"The Senate will vote on this nomination this year,\" McConnell, R-Ky., said Monday on the Senate floor. He didn't say whether the vote would come before the election, or in a lame duck-session of Congress that occurs after the November election and before the start of a new session in 2021. Trump told reporters he would probably announce his pick on Saturday. He is considering a group of five female candidates. Trump repeated his preference that the Senate vote on the nominee before the Nov. 3 election. McConnell pushed back at those who argued that with just weeks left before the election the Senate can't complete the confirmation process, saying there are 43 days until the election and 104 until the end of this session of Congress. \"The Senate has more than sufficient time to process the nomination. History and precedent make that perfectly clear.\" He cited several Supreme Court confirmation votes \u2014 including Ginsburg's \u2014 that took place within a similar or shorter period of time. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., slammed Republicans for acting on the vacancy this close to the election, saying they've \"made a mockery of their previous positions\" in 2016 when McConnell blocked action on President Barack Obama's nominee, Merrick Garland, to fill a vacancy due to the death of Justice Antonin Scalia. But McConnell maintains that the situation this year is not analogous to the 2016 instance because there was divided government then. He said voters elected a GOP majority in the Senate in 2016 and expanded it in 2018 because Republicans touted their plan to work with the president on his nominations to the federal judiciary. \"Perhaps more than any other single issue, the American people strengthened this Senate majority to keep confirming this president's impressive judicial nominees who respect our Constitution and understand the proper role of a judge,\" McConnell said. So far two Senate Republicans \u2014 Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska \u2014 have said they do not believe the Senate should take up the president's nomination before the election. If another two GOP senators joined them and opposed the vote, McConnell would be unable to proceed \u2014 or he could be forced to postpone action until after the election when they might be open to backing the president's nominee. The chances of that continued to dim Monday night, though, when another moderate Republican came out in favor of a vote. Sen. Cory Gardner of Colorado said in a statement, \"Should a qualified nominee who meets this criteria be put forward, I will vote to confirm.\" Retiring Republican Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee said over the weekend he too would support his party in voting on a nominee in an election year. Schumer said the vacancy on the high court puts \"everything on the line\" \u2014 listing health care, same-sex marriage, reproductive rights, workers' rights and voting rights.  \"If you care about these things and the kind of country we live in \u2014 this election, and this vacancy, mean everything.\"",

The fourth annual Women's March descended on the streets of Washington on Saturday. But unlike the first demonstration that brought hundreds of thousands to the capital the day after President Trump's inauguration, the march drew just a fraction of the original turnout as the movement has struggled with changes in leadership and questions about inclusivity. The demonstration in Washington was the main march, but sister marches were also held in more than 200 cities around the world, including Los Angeles, Chicago and Brussels. As snowflakes began to fall in Washington, protesters gathered at Freedom Plaza to hear several members of the Women's March board speak before taking off on the designated route around the White House. This year, the march focused on three main issues: climate change, reproductive rights and immigration. Nadrat Amos, 18, participated for the first time along with several classmates from Howard University. She said she'd stayed away from previous marches because she felt like the organization primarily championed white, middle-class women. But going into this year's election, she said, it became increasingly important to her to show up on behalf of all people of color and black women, specifically. The energy we\u2019re bringing now through November 3rd. 2020 is our year. Thank you @BatalaDC for marching and bringing the rhythm. #WomensMarch2020 pic.twitter.com/oZiqgXHF9X \"The Women's March has had a history of marginalizing certain people. They want their version of smashing patriarchy to look a certain way,\" she said. \"I'm black, I'm proud. This is my march as much as it is any other person's march.\" Amos' criticisms come at a time of transition for the organization. After claims of anti-Semitism pushed three founding members of the Women's March to step down from their roles last year, a bigger and more diverse board took their place. This year's anti-Trump demonstration drew a significantly smaller crowd than in 2017 when crowds overwhelmed parts of downtown Washington and high-profile activists like Madonna and Gloria Steinem addressed the marchers. The permit filed with the National Park Service for this year's march, by comparison, allowed up for up to 10,000 people. Protesters like Becky Halbe, who used to work at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, said she didn't feel phased by the lower turnout. \"The energy is still there. We can't give up \u2014 this is important to show that we do care,\" she said. Unlike in previous years, Saturday's march in Washington did not feature a stage for performances and speeches from celebrities. Instead, in an effort to reconnect with supporters, organizers marched alongside everybody else. Upon reaching the White House, Chilean collective LasTesis led the crowd through a rendition of their viral protest anthem \"Un Violador En Tu Camino\" (\"A Rapist in Your Path\"). A different group of protesters also stopped in front of the White House to chant the words of Article 2, Section 4 of the Constitution in reference to President Trump's impeachment. Quoting the Constitution, they chanted: \"The President, Vice President and all civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.\" For Connor Czora, who carried a sign with the colors of the transgender flag in Washington, Saturday's march represented an important moment in the fight against the people they described as most targeted by the Trump administration. \"I'm here in support of women protesting against Trump's actions, against his divisive rhetoric, against his attacks on women and trans people,\" Czora said. \"Trans women are especially under attack.\"",

Organizers hosted the event to bring supporters together ahead of this year's Women's March, scheduled for Saturday. On an unusually warm January afternoon, 28-year-old Icy Coomber attended a poster-making session for the fourth annual Women's March in Washington, D.C. Unlike the friend she accompanied to the event, Coomber did not participate in any of the previous anti-Trump demonstrations. Three years ago, the first march drew hundreds of thousands of people to the nation's capital and hosted sister marches in cities around the world. But the Women's March has struggled since then, facing controversy for some of its leadership and criticism for being a space for primarily white, cisgender women. Last year, three founding members stepped down following allegations of anti-Semitism, and a new, bigger board took their place. Now, the Women's March is back on Jan. 18 with a restructured lineup and mission \u2014 and some people who did not feel enticed to join in the past are giving it a second chance. \"When we're talking about women's rights, I feel like black women or women of color are usually left out of that conversation,\" Coomber said. \"But I think not going, not representing people like me, doesn't help anything. I'm trying to have a change of heart.\" The community art build that Coomber attended is part of the organization's goal to foster deeper partnerships with existing movements. After polling its base of supporters, the Women's March decided to focus on three main topics for this year's events: climate, reproductive justice and immigrants' rights. Every night in the week leading up to the march itself, the organization has hosted panel discussions with activists from those fields. And on Saturday, there will no longer be a stage for the organizers and high-profile celebrities. Instead, the new leaders will march alongside everyone else, and Chilean collective LasTesis will lead the group in a rendition of its viral protest anthem, \"Un Violador En Tu Camino\" (\"A Rapist In Your Path\"). This year's Women's March will focus on climate, reproductive justice and immigrants' rights.\n                \n                    \n                    Isabella Gomez Sarmiento/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption This year's Women's March will focus on climate, reproductive justice and immigrants' rights. \"It just felt like the political moment is with the people \u2014 and you see that not just with our country but around the globe with a lot of people coming out and taking the streets,\" Rachel O'Leary Carmona, the Women's March chief operating officer, said about the decision to nix the stage. \"It just felt like it was a time to be shoulder to shoulder with folks and be where the power is.\" The crowd, however, will be smaller this year than in the past. The permit filed with the National Park Service allows for up to 10,000 protesters. Celeste Montoya, who teaches gender studies and mobilizations at the University of Colorado Boulder, says it's normal for social movements to lose steam over time \u2014 but she's not sure the Women's March is still as necessary as it was in 2017. \"In that first march, it was just kind of what a Trump presidency might materialize into, and since then, a lot of those threats have materialized,\" she said. \"Whereas before it was kind of a collective perception of threat, now there are really specific things to mobilize on.\" Protests surrounding climate, immigrants' rights and the #MeToo movement have taken off on their own since the first Women's March. And yet, some people continue to be drawn to the large-scale demonstration that made a big splash following the 2016 election. Crystal Clarity, an art director for the march, teaches volunteers how to screen-print posters for the march.\n                \n                    \n                    Isabella Gomez Sarmiento/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Crystal Clarity, an art director for the march, teaches volunteers how to screen-print posters for the march. Artist Crystal Clarity did not march in past years because she chose to focus her energy on local issues in Brooklyn, where she lives. But this year, she accepted the opportunity to help direct the artwork for the D.C. march \u2014 and she's already looking ahead at what comes after Saturday. \"My experience with mobilizations and marches in general is that it's not enough to take the streets; we kind of have to keep it. We have to keep the streets,\" she told NPR. \"Real permanent change doesn't happen with one-day events.\" Carmona agrees. She says she feels like now more than ever, women need to band together across social movements and show up for one another. \"This march is the last march before the 2020 presidential election, and literally everything that we love is on the line,\" she said.",

            "article_content": "A synagogue in Pueblo, Colo. hosts a diverse group of worshipers \u2014 many of whom struggled in the aftermath of a threatened terrorist attack.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: I'm Ari Shapiro in Pueblo, Colo. Jews in America today are acutely aware that they are targets. Anti-Semitic incidents are becoming more common, from swastika graffiti to physical violence. A synagogue here in Pueblo recently brushed up against that reality. We're hosting the show from here today, one of the cities we're focused on for NPR's yearlong project Where Voters Are. From now through the election, we will be asking where voters are with candidates and where they are on the issues. Even though the city of Pueblo only has about 100,000 people, it's home to one of the oldest synagogues west of the Mississippi. Temple Emanuel was built around the year 1900. BIRDIE BECKER: Although it looks like it was picked up out of a shtetl in Europe, it actually was built here. SHAPIRO: Rabbi Birdie Becker leads us into the sanctuary through a red brick arch. In the morning, the rising sun shines through a stained-glass window over the front entrance. Now with the sun low in the sky, the flaming light of late afternoon bursts through another stained-glass window over the arc that holds the Torah scrolls. A few months ago, the FBI arrested a 27-year-old white supremacist and charged him with plotting to blow up this synagogue. BECKER: What we would have lost would've just been amazing. The history down here, this little wing here, this little alcove, has the history of where Judaism really began in this state. SHAPIRO: It's photographs and artifacts. There's Shabbat candles and a menorah, a kiddush cup and certificates dating back, I'm sure, almost a century. BECKER: More than that because the congregation began before the building existed. SHAPIRO: Jewish merchants came here in the 1800s to supply steel mill workers. The photographs show well-dressed men and women at banquet tables celebrating marriages and bar mitzvahs. Today the congregation has about 35 families. They include Republicans and Democrats ranging in age from a baby to a 98-year-old Holocaust survivor. BECKER: Everything - farmers, people come who live in the city, people who come from the mountains. SHAPIRO: As rabbi, is it hard to unify all of those differences? BECKER: So because we're small, we know that we need to be together. SHAPIRO: I asked Rabbi Becker whether the threat against this synagogue has cast a shadow over the community. And at first, she said, no. It's brought people together. Donations poured in from all over the country. Churches and mosques came out to support Temple Emanuel. But then she told me she arrived for our meeting a little early, and a strange man was sitting on the steps in front of the synagogue. BECKER: Where I might have gotten out of my car before, I wouldn't do that now. Where our door used to be open, now we have someone who sits and guards it. It's locked. You can't just walk in. You have to knock to get in. SHAPIRO: That feels like a concession that it must have been difficult to make. BECKER: It is, but it's reality now. So you make it. SHAPIRO: Do you think it's a temporary reality? BECKER: No. No, I think it's where the world is going, and Jews have always been the canaries in the coal mine. SHAPIRO: Some people have argued that the rise in anti-Semitism is a direct reflection of rhetoric from powerful people in politics. BECKER: I think that it's a lot more than the rhetoric. I think it goes much deeper. Othering can happen to and has happened with so many groups - the turning back of the clock for the LGBTQ community, the turning back of the clock for immigration, the turning back of the clock for women's rights and reproductive rights. SHAPIRO: What you are saying sounds like an indictment of the Trump administration, and you have a congregation in which many people are Trump voters and Trump supporters. BECKER: Correct. SHAPIRO: Does that make it difficult for you to say this (laughter)? BECKER: I did not indict Trump. SHAPIRO: OK. BECKER: I did not bring his name up. SHAPIRO: Am I misinterpreting your remarks? BECKER: Everyone can interpret them as they see. SHAPIRO: So that's how you walk that tightrope. BECKER: That's how I walk the tightrope. SHAPIRO: One of the congregation's Trump supporters is the synagogue president, Michael Atlas-Acuna. MICHAEL ATLAS-ACUNA: I come from a Mexican background, OK? I come from a background of people who are continuously being told that we're too stupid to do certain things, that I'm too stupid to get my own ID card and go vote. There's too much pandering to people of color and women. And I just think that's - to me, the Democratic Party that I used to belong to is no longer that. SHAPIRO: When did you switch? ATLAS-ACUNA: I'm not a Republican either. I'm an independent. I switched about five years ago. SHAPIRO: Oh, wow. So did you vote for Obama and then for Trump? ATLAS-ACUNA: No, I didn't vote for Obama. Rabbi Birdie and I are on opposite sides. She probably told you that. But, you know, I respect her. SHAPIRO: Do you have any advice for the rest of the 300 million people in America who might be having a tough time either breaking out of their bubble or having a conversation with somebody outside of their bubble that doesn't turn into screaming? ATLAS-ACUNA: I think, first of all, become Jewish and learn how to listen. (LAUGHTER) ATLAS-ACUNA: And learn and understand that there's two sides to an argument. SHAPIRO: When the FBI arrested the man plotting to bomb this synagogue, Atlas-Acuna was the first person they called. And in the months since then, members of the congregation have offered help in a distinctly Colorado way. ATLAS-ACUNA: We just have some people here that came to me and said, don't ever worry about it because we're - I have a concealed permit. And there's about three or four of them that do. SHAPIRO: It seems like a way of saying we're not going to be victims. ATLAS-ACUNA: Exactly. That's why I put that sign up there. SHAPIRO: The sign that says, this is not a gun-free zone. ATLAS-ACUNA: That's right. Why would any soft target put up a sign that's saying it's a gun-free zone? You're just asking for trouble. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED SINGERS: (Singing in Hebrew). SHAPIRO: It's Friday night, and people are singing Hebrew prayers to usher in Shabbat. Rabbi Birdie is strumming a guitar. Michael Atlas-Acuna keeps rhythm on the congas. There's also a violin and an accordion. This is a day of peace in a trying time. After the service, people mill around the social hall next door eating homemade challah and cookies. Members of the congregation tell me this election is inflaming the anxiety that's been brewing since they heard about the bomb threat. Miriam Neff considers herself a liberal Democrat, and she says even with nine months until the election, she's as stressed as she was in the last month of the 2016 campaign. MIRIAM NEFF: I'm really scared about this election cycle. Instead of feeling that way in October, I'm feeling that way in February. What is it going to be like in another six months? SHAPIRO: And the knowledge that her community is a target makes it even worse. NEFF: I don't talk about being Jewish very freely. The place that I thought was so safe and secure was not as safe as I had imagined it to be. SHAPIRO: Mark Schuman told me he's shocked to encounter this anti-Semitism in a place like Pueblo. MARK SCHUMAN: I grew up in a very Bible-belt town, never have experienced any anti-Semitism in my life. Some of Trump's comments have probably not helped the situation. I'll put it that way. And I'm a Trumper (ph). SHAPIRO: You're a Trumper. SCHUMAN: I am. SHAPIRO: But you think he bears responsibility for this. SCHUMAN: I wouldn't go that far, but I would say that he certainly hasn't helped. But I think when you look at the results in the economy, the economy's good. And most people vote with their pocketbooks, so... SHAPIRO: Before we leave the synagogue, board president Michael Atlas-Acuna shows us one of the improvements that Temple Emanuel purchased with all the donations that came in after the arrest. It's a high-tech security system with night-vision cameras. He can access the live feed on his phone 24/7 to see if there are any threats to this century-old house of worship.

            "article_content": "Democrats, who boycotted the Senate Judiciary Committee vote to move Judge Amy Coney Barrett's nomination to the full Senate, held a news conference.  NOEL KING, HOST: The Senate Judiciary Committee has advanced the Supreme Court nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Mr. Chairman, the votes are 12 yeas and 10 not present. LINDSEY GRAHAM: Motion is passed. Thank you. KING: All 12 Republican senators voted for her nomination. The committee's 10 Democrats did not show up. They were boycotting the proceedings. NPR congressional reporter Claudia Grisales has been following this story and the proceedings. Good morning, Claudia. CLAUDIA GRISALES, BYLINE: Good morning, Noel. KING: So fairly short today, this morning. What happened? GRISALES: Yes, it all went by very quickly - all said and done in under 12 minutes. This is a very dramatic shift from what we saw last week, with hours and hours of testimony, at least 20 hours of questioning Barrett by the members on the panel, both Republicans and Democrats. But today, Democrats boycotted. They did not show up. Republican senators on the Judiciary Committee sidestepped that no-show to move Barrett's nomination forward to the full Senate. Democrats said they were boycotting because they wanted to highlight the damage that Barrett would do to health care, reproductive and voting rights and the fact that the vote took place amid a presidential election. And this is one battle Democrats say perhaps they'll lose, but they're looking to win a bigger war. Graham alluded to that when he talked about the next vote on the Senate floor. Let's take a listen. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) GRAHAM: They started this - not me. If it were up to me, it'd be a 60-vote requirement in the Senate today. GRISALES: And he's referring to the Senate filibuster there. This is a requirement of 60 votes that was once needed to approve a nomination like Barrett's. But the filibuster was eliminated in 2013, as Democrats struggled to move their judges forward when they controlled the chamber with the tight margin. So that's what Graham is referencing. And he added later that perhaps this will be addressed again in the future. However, now that the Senate is controlled by Republicans with tight margins, they're able to push through Barrett's nomination with just 51 votes. And it's a preview of the battles to come, that this will go on after Barrett's nomination, this conversation, even as she goes to the floor to be considered by the full Senate and we see if Democrats ultimately change the dynamics of power in the Senate or the presidency through the upcoming Election Day. KING: How did Democrats respond today? They didn't just say nothing, right? GRISALES: Yes. There had been rumors for days that Democrats could boycott these hearings. They were facing a lot of pressure from outside groups to even skip out on the hearings last week questioning Barrett, but they decided not to do that last week. Instead, they did it today. So later yesterday, they confirmed that they would all not show. Today, their empty seats were filled instead with images of Americans who have used the Affordable Care Act. This is a case that could become - it could be considered before the court next month. And so this is one critical issue they've been highlighting all along. They also held a news conference after the vote. This was led by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer on the steps of the Capitol. Let's take a listen. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CHUCK SCHUMER: The nomination of Amy Coney Barrett is the most illegitimate process I have ever witnessed in the Senate, and her potential confirmation will have dire, dire consequences for the Senate, for the Supreme Court and our entire country for generations to come. GRISALES: So this was the theme they've been driving through this entire process. Barrett will shift the court to a 6-3 conservative majority. And they say she's a foe to the Affordable Care Act, the landmark abortion rights case Roe v. Wade, and she could play a role if there's a dispute in the election. This has activated opposition as well. There were protesters outside the Capitol speaking against this nomination. This resulted in about a half a dozen arrests so far today. I spoke to Judiciary Committee Democrat Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut yesterday. He said the watchword for them is, no more business as usual. He and the other members have been driving home this point that this is a sham process; it's not normal, it's not right, and Americans should see it for what it is. And we'll probably see more of this in the coming days. KING: Because there is so much acrimony over this nomination. GRISALES: Yes, exactly - so many reasons. We're in the midst of a pandemic. They're rushing this through in 30 days, one of the fastest we've seen. The fight over health care and, of course, you know, the division between Republicans and Democrats really exemplified by President Trump pushing this forward. And so there's a long history as well of these fights over the Supreme Court and the controversy surrounding these nominations. If we go back to 2016, Democrats try to move forward President Obama's nominee at the time - this is Judge Merrick Garland - and Republicans refused because they said they were so close to an election, months away. But here we are now. People are early voting, and they're pushing this through. So this has set into motion a series of debates to come, and we're even hearing about it from the Democratic nominee, Joe Biden, this morning. We understand he told \"60 Minutes\" that he's going to create a study, a commission, to - bipartisan commission to study whether they should add more seats to the court. So a lot more to come here. KING: Including next week, right? What happens then? GRISALES: So tomorrow, the nomination for Barrett actually will reach the full Senate floor. It's going to be followed by some procedural votes on Friday, as well as on Sunday. In between, we're going to see a lot of debate and argument back and forth. But the real final moment for this will come Monday, when the full Senate will submit their votes for Barrett to confirm or vote against her nomination to the Supreme Court. KING: NPR congressional reporter Claudia Grisales. Thanks, Claudia. GRISALES: Thanks for having me. Copyright \u00a9 2020 NPR.  All rights reserved.

They have announced they will boycott Thursday's scheduled committee vote on Barrett. Updated at 6:45 p.m. ET Senate Democrats say they plan to boycott Thursday's scheduled vote on the nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court. \"Throughout the hearings last week, committee Democrats demonstrated the damage a Justice Barrett would do \u2013 to health care, reproductive freedoms, the ability to vote, and other core rights that Americans cherish,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee said in a statement announcing their boycott. \"We will not grant this process any further legitimacy by participating in a committee markup of this nomination just twelve days before the culmination of an election that is already underway.\" Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham rejected the Democratic assertion that at least two minority members were needed to proceed with the nomination. \"I will move forward,\" he said Wednesday evening. \"She deserves a vote.\" In a subsequent statement, Graham called the Democratic decision to boycott the vote \"a choice they are making. I believe it does a disservice to Judge Barrett who deserves a vote, up or down.\" In his statement, he added: \"The nomination process took a dark turn in 2013 when the Democrats changed the rules of the Senate for District and Circuit court nominees requiring a simple majority vote. My Democratic colleagues chose to engage in a partisan filibuster of Justice [Neil] Gorsuch for the first time in U.S. history requiring the changing of the rules regarding Supreme Court nominations.\" When asked about Graham's remarks, Schumer replied: \"We're not giving the quorum they need to provide it. The rules require it.\" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has indicated he is planning a full Senate vote on the nomination on Monday. The maneuver would ensure that Barrett could be sworn in before the Nov. 3 election and that she could participate in election questions that are already pending before the Supreme Court. President Trump has said he wanted Barrett confirmed before the election so she could be there to rule on cases that might arise in the aftermath of the election. Barrett, for her part, refused at her confirmation hearings to say whether she would recuse herself in light of Trump's statements. But it is unlikely that she would do so. Nothing in the judicial ethics rules would appear to require such a recusal unless it presents the appearance of impropriety. Questions of recusal are ultimately decided by each justice for himself or herself, and at the Supreme Court, recusal can sometimes result in a tie vote. Should that happen, the lower court decision in the case stands. The Democrats' boycott comes at a time that the progressive wing of the party is leaning on the Democratic Senate leadership to do more to call attention to what is widely viewed on the Democratic side of the aisle as an \"outrageous\" power play to get Barrett confirmed in record time for a nominee in modern times. Barrett's confirmation hearings began just 16 days after her nomination. In contrast, the average time between nomination and hearings for each of the current justices on the Supreme Court was 56 days. The result of the rushed confirmation process has been little time to explore Barrett's record, both on and off the bench. Indeed, this week The Associated Press published a long investigative piece disclosing that \"Barrett served for nearly three years on the board of private Christian schools that effectively  barred admission to children of same-sex parents.\" But the article was published too late for senators to ask questions of Barrett at her confirmation hearings.",

            "article_content": "NPR discusses how the Biden administration's approach to health care would be different from President Trump's.  AILSA CHANG, HOST: The election of Joe Biden means a change at the White House and a change in many policies. Let's take a look now at health care. Biden ran on the promise of a public option and more federal involvement in the coronavirus crisis that has engulfed the nation. And here to talk us through what to expect is NPR's Selena Simmons-Duffin. Hey, Selena. SELENA SIMMONS-DUFFIN, BYLINE: Hi, Ailsa. CHANG: Hi. So first, can you just give us sort of a big-picture view on how the Biden administration's approach to health and health care could be quite different from President Trump's? SIMMONS-DUFFIN: Yeah. I think the main difference that animates a lot of Biden's policies is the belief that access to health care is a right and that the federal government has a role to play in ensuring people have access to that right. So his platform included ideas like expanding access to Medicare, giving people the option to enroll at age 60 - of course, right now it's 65 - creating a public option, as you mentioned, which is a government-run program like Medicare that people of any age could buy into, and expanding subsidies on the insurance exchanges to make premiums more affordable for more people. And the belief that the federal government should be more involved and more invested shows up in his plans to address the pandemic as well. CHANG: Right. OK, so those are his ideas. I mean, those are the ideas he ran on, but what might actually he be able to get done? SIMMONS-DUFFIN: Well, that's a really big question mark right now, and a lot depends on which party controls the Senate. I talked to Larry Levitt of the Kaiser Family Foundation about this, and here's what he said. LARRY LEVITT: Many parts of Biden's plan are likely dead in the water if Republicans keep control of the Senate. SIMMONS-DUFFIN: So if Republicans do maintain control, which won't be clear until January because we have these two runoffs in Georgia... CHANG: Right. SIMMONS-DUFFIN: ...Attention will turn to what Biden can do with executive actions. And Levitt pointed out that Trump has kind of made a playbook for this. He wasn't able to get any significant health legislation through Congress, so he was creative about using the power of the presidency to shape health care; for instance, promoting short-term or skinny health care plans and limiting federal funding for reproductive health. So Biden could use the same power to undo many of those things and promote his very different health care agenda. CHANG: OK, so how would that play out? Like, what's one way? SIMMONS-DUFFIN: Well, think about Medicaid. That is the public health program for 68 million low-income people, pregnant women and children. Jamila Michener, a professor of government at Cornell University, says that she could see states coming to the Biden administration with new ideas about how to use Medicaid funding. JAMILA MICHENER: To cover housing costs - right? - because the notion is that housing is health. SIMMONS-DUFFIN: So using that funding to help people from being evicted and thinking about health outside of what happens in doctors' offices and hospitals - and another point Michener made is that the pandemic is clearly a really critical crisis right now and definitely the first order of business. But, she says... MICHENER: It would be savvy for the Biden administration to use the pandemic as sort of a vehicle for making forward progress with respect to health care. SIMMONS-DUFFIN: For instance, by rebuilding public health and federal health agencies like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. CHANG: OK, but before we get to any of the stuff that you're talking about, there is, of course, a big Supreme Court case being argued tomorrow about the fate of the Affordable Care Act. Tell us, how might that case affect the Biden agenda, you think? SIMMONS-DUFFIN: Right. The Supreme Court will hear arguments tomorrow about whether the ACA, which is also known as Obamacare, is constitutional. Because of the details of the case, there might be a kind of simple way that president-elect Biden could work with Congress to get rid of or change the specific part of the law that the court case is focused on, which could make the case moot. And if that doesn't happen and the court does overturn the ACA, it could be a big problem. Tens of millions of people might become uninsured during a pandemic. And it's hard to see how a country and government this sharply divided could come together and pass a whole new comprehensive health law to prevent the chaos from happening if the court rules to overturn the ACA. CHANG: That is NPR's Selena Simmons-Duffin. Thank you, Selena. SIMMONS-DUFFIN: Thanks, Ailsa. Copyright \u00a9 2020 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "In Congress, Mike Pompeo was one of the toughest critics of Hillary Clinton when she was secretary of state. Wrapping up his time as secretary of state, Pompeo's getting harsh reviews for partisanship  AILSA CHANG, HOST: In Congress, Mike Pompeo made a name for himself as one of the toughest critics of then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Now, as he wraps up his time as secretary of state, he's getting harsh reviews for his partisanship. NPR's Michele Kelemen takes a look at his legacy. MICHELE KELEMEN, BYLINE: When Secretary Pompeo first arrived at the State Department, some veteran diplomats hoped that his close relations with the president would mean that after a year of cutbacks, the State Department was back in the game. Pompeo put it this way. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MIKE POMPEO: They're hopeful that the State Department will get its swagger back, that we will be out doing the things that they came on board at the State Department to do, to be professional, to deliver diplomacy, American diplomacy around the world. That's my mission set to build that esprit and get the team on the field. KELEMEN: But his close ties to the president often came with a cost to that team. Pompeo refused to support the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine who was ousted after a smear campaign by Trump's private lawyer. More recently, he shocked many diplomats overseas when he fueled President Trump's baseless claims about this year's election results. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) POMPEO: There will be a smooth transition to a second Trump administration. KELEMEN: In recent interviews with conservative media, Pompeo stresses the hard line he's taken on Iran and China. But Tamara Cofman Wittes of the Brookings Institution says the secretary, who has his own presidential ambitions, will be remembered for something else. TAMARA COFMAN WITTES: Secretary Pompeo's lasting mark on American foreign policy is the extent to which he politicized the State Department and the conduct of American foreign policy and made it a part of advancing his own domestic political interests. KELEMEN: She says he used State Department resources to network. Congressional Democrats have been looking into the dinners Pompeo and his wife hosted with donors and political supporters. And Wittes says pompons recent trip to Israel, where he visited a West Bank settlement and an evangelical Christian museum, seemed mostly aimed at building up his appeal to his fellow evangelicals. WITTES: That may all serve him well in the future. I don't think it serves the United States well in the world, but I do think that that is his most lasting legacy. KELEMEN: Pompeo himself count his work against abortion rights as one of his major achievements. The administration has expanded what's known as the global gag rule to block all funding to organizations overseas that provide abortion counseling or services. And in October, Pompeo signed an anti-abortion declaration, along with countries such as Belarus, Hungary, Egypt, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) POMPEO: We continue our unprecedented defense of the unborn by signing the Geneva Consensus Declaration alongside 32 other nations. I'm especially proud that we made religious freedom a top priority in the United States foreign policy for the first time in America's history. KELEMEN: A former State Department official who worked on human rights, though, worries that other civil liberties may be curbed in the name of religious freedom. Rori Kramer points to the latest International Conference on Religious Freedom. RORI KRAMER: They hosted it in Poland, a country that has LGBTQ-free zones that has basically banned all reproductive access. And they bragged about hosting this religious ministerial freedom. KELEMEN: Kramer is now with the American Jewish World Service. KRAMER: When I worked at the State Department, we didn't infuse politics and religion into policy in particular and to universal human rights. And so now the State Department staff has been asked to make basic human rights of others into a domestic political issue. KELEMEN: She expects a Biden administration to toss aside some of these policies. The U.S. envoy on religious freedom, though, says he's hoping that Pompeo's emphasis on that issue will outlive his tenure as secretary of state. Michele Kelemen, NPR News, the State Department.

A new NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist survey finds that more than sixty percent of Americans \u2014 but just one quarter of Republicans \u2014 say they trust the results of the 2020 presidential election. That comes as President Trump continues to push baseless allegations of electoral fraud as he has for more than a month, even as his lawsuits falter in court. Now, two-thirds of Americans believe that Trump should formally concede to President-elect Joe Biden\u2014a belief shared by fewer than four in ten Republicans. Other toplines from the survey: Also: is old-school pork barrel spending the solution to Washington gridlock? Earmarks, pet project funding tucked inside of other legislation, are finding new support on Capitol Hill after previously being banned. In a report on the modernization of Congress out in October, House Democrats called for the return of earmarks (well, of \"Community-Focused Grant Programs\") as a way to incentivize deal-making. But bringing them back will probably require both parties to be invested in the change\u2014neither Democrats nor Republicans want to be seen as stewards of graft. Plus, across-the-aisle support would make it less likely that earmarks become cudgels in partisan combat. President Obama was famously opposed to earmarks, promising to veto any legislation that included them. It isn't something that President-elect Joe Biden has recently weighed in on.Connect:Subscribe to the NPR Politics Podcast here.Email the show at nprpolitics@npr.org.Join the NPR Politics Podcast Facebook Group.Listen to our playlist The NPR Politics Daily Workout.Subscribe to the NPR Politics Newsletter.Find and support your local public radio station.

            "article_content": "NPR takes a final look at the top House and Senate races and what is at stake in the next Congress.  MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: No matter who wins the presidential race on Tuesday, the success of the next president will depend on the outcome in the nation's congressional races. Democrats are expected to hold onto their House majority, but control of the Senate is up for grabs. Joining us for one last pre-Election Day check-in on those key races, here are our congressional correspondents, Susan Davis and Kelsey Snell. Welcome, welcome, you two. SUSAN DAVIS, BYLINE: Hey, Mary Louise. KELSEY SNELL, BYLINE: Thanks for having us. KELLY: Sue, you first. To remind, Republicans, at this moment, enjoy a 53-seat majority in the Senate. How likely is it that that's going to flip to Democrats? DAVIS: Well, I think based on all available evidence - and that includes public polling and the reporting that Kelsey and I have been doing - it's more likely than not. Even Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell conceded this week that it's, in his words, a 50-50 proposition. Republicans are likely going to pick up at least one Democratic seat in Alabama, and that means Democrats would need to then gain at least four seats and win the White House to get the most narrow 50-seat majority. Democrats think they're most likely going to win three Republican-held seats in Arizona, Colorado and Maine. And if they're right, they just have one more seat to clinch that fourth. And they're looking at races in North Carolina, Iowa and Montana as that next tier where party strategists think they can win at least one, if not more, to clinch that majority. KELLY: Now, Kelsey, over on the House side - considerably less suspense. As we noted, control of the House is not really in doubt this year. Is there any suspense in what is happening in House races? SNELL: You know, there actually is. But it's really a question about whether Democrats will grow their majority or not. You know, right now, most forecasters believe Democrats will gain somewhere between five and 15 seats. Republican strategists I've spoke with say they hope to hold Democrats to single-digit gains. That may not seem like a lot, but Democrats themselves talked about their current 232-seat majority as a high watermark after the 2018 wave. It's also extremely interesting to me that Democrats could gain House seats in states where President Trump is polling ahead, places like Texas. And I think that really speaks to one of the bigger trends of 2020. That's the collapse of the Republican Party in a lot of suburban districts where Republicans used to really have a stronghold there. It's a potential bellwether for how the presidential race might go. If Republicans are losing a large number of House seats that Trump won four years ago, on Tuesday night, that could mean a lot of chances for House pickups. KELLY: Many chances, hundreds of congressional races on the ballot, as in every election year. Let me ask you both your pick for one race that we should keep a close eye on on Tuesday as one of those possible bellwethers you mentioned. Kelsey? SNELL: I'm going back to Texas on this and back to the suburbs in particular. Democrats and Republicans both tell me that the fate of some suburban districts there could be signs of broader trends in the country. I'm particularly watching open seats outside of Houston and Dallas. These are both currently held by Republicans who are leaving, and the races are virtually tied. If Democrats are winning there, it could be a sign of a wave for House Democrats. KELLY: Sue Davis, how about you? DAVIS: For me, it's all about North Carolina. I have not spoken to a single person, Republican or Democrat, this entire election year who didn't think this Senate race is directly tied to the top of the ticket. And one of the big reasons here is another trend - is that fewer and fewer Americans split their tickets between the two parties anymore. And I think North Carolina is the best example of that. If President Trump is winning North Carolina, then so is Republican Senator Thom Tillis. And the reverse is true. If Joe Biden is winning North Carolina, then so is Democratic candidate Cal Cunningham. Mary Louise, if you think about how important North Carolina is to both the path to the White House and the Senate majority, whichever way that race is called could tell us a lot about how this election's going to go. KELLY: Big picture, I mean, we're looking at one of two scenarios, right? It sounds like either we're going to have a split Congress exactly like we have right now or full Democratic control of both houses. So what does that mean looking past the election in terms of what comes next, Kelsey Snell? SNELL: We know that a divided Congress looks pretty unproductive. And there's no really good reason to think that an era of gridlock is going to change, especially at how baked in the partisanship is in the system. So let's look a little bit forward just past Election Day to the lame-duck session. And there's still a COVID relief package to work out. Traditionally, it's really difficult to get big legislation through in a lame duck. That's that time period between an election and the inauguration and the start of the new Congress. And Congress still has to pass a government funding bill in early December. If Trump loses, Democrats may decide to hold off on a new COVID bill until a new administration, where they could get a bigger package. If President Trump wins, Republicans may decide they have no incentive to negotiate over big-ticket items like, you know, state and local funding and national testing and tracing regimes that are real deal-breakers for Democrats. DAVIS: And this is Sue here again. I mean, if Democrats sweep Congress and Joe Biden is president, buckle up. There is going to be so much pressure within the factions in the Democratic Party to get an agenda through Congress. And the pressure on Senate Democrats to blow up the filibuster, which requires supermajorities to get anything difficult through the chamber, is going to get so intense. I mean, Speaker Nancy Pelosi this week outlined what she thinks their agenda is going to be - climate change legislation, expanding health care coverage, lowering prescription drug costs and democracy and voting reform. And that's just the beginning. If you remember the last time Democrats controlled all levers of government - it was after the 2008 wave election, and it was one of the most productive two years in modern congressional times. That's when they passed the Affordable Care Act, for instance. Democrats want to do that again. And I would say what's different now than 12 years ago is there's a lot less patience with Democrats to try to find compromise with Republicans.

High-profile supporters of President Trump took the stage in Georgia on Wednesday to spread conspiracy theories and tell the state's Republicans not to vote in the crucial U.S. Senate runoffs there next month. The outcome of those races will determine which party controls the Senate next year. At the rally in Atlanta, pro-Trump attorney Lin Wood took the microphone to tell the crowd that last month's election, won by Joe Biden, had been manipulated. \"Do not be fooled twice. This is Georgia, we ain't dumb. We ain't gonna go vote on Jan. 5 on another machine made by China,\" said Wood, who has no formal affiliation with Trump's campaign. \"You're not gonna fool Georgians again.\" Polls suggest that many Republican voters have been swayed by Trump's baseless talk that last month's election was rigged against him. Tuesday's rally was one of several that have taken place since Nov. 3. At another recent rally, Missy Landers was one of hundreds of pro-Trump demonstrators who showed up outside Georgia's Capitol in Atlanta, unmasked and angry about unproven allegations of widespread election fraud. \"I've always voted and things like that, but I think we need to know what's going on,\" said Landers. She's the kind of reliable Republican voter Georgia's GOP establishment is counting on to hold the two Senate seats held by Sen. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler. Both senators failed to receive more than 50% of the vote last month and face Democrats Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock in runoff elections on Jan. 5. But like many Republican voters, she believes Trump's false rhetoric that the election was stolen. And party leaders have begun to worry that message could deter voters. \"All of the news about the ballots, the electronic systems, all the different things that happen during the election and is continuing to come out. I don't feel secure about it,\" said Landers. \"Crazy\" and \"whack-a-mole\" theories Georgia's Republican election officials say that there's no evidence of any widespread fraud and that these conspiracy theories are \"crazy\" and like a game of \"whack-a-mole.\" The state certified its election results on Nov. 20 after a hand recount of approximately 5 million paper ballots. A second recount requested by the Trump campaign was completed Wednesday night and did not appreciably change Biden's lead of more than 12,000 votes. \"We've got to get a grip on ourselves people,\" said former state Sen. Chuck Clay, who also once served at the state GOP chair. \"What we can't have is this sense of just conspiratorial madness that I think certainly does the body politic harm and I don't think helps our candidates.\" Clay enthusiastically supports both Perdue and Loeffler. But as candidates, they've embraced Trump's election fraud theories, calling Georgia's 2020 elections \"an embarrassment\" and going so far as to demand that Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger resign. These messages, along with Trump's tweets, have clearly reached some Georgia voters. During a recent visit here, Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel responded to voters asking why they should participate in an election they no longer trust. \"It's not decided. This is the key. It's not decided,\" McDaniel insisted to the crowd. Clay says that Republicans who were upset by the general election results should dust themselves off and vote. \"Yeah, there are some people there that won't go vote as a form of protest or frustration. I don't think that will be many and I don't find that to be productive.\" On Wednesday, 18 former state GOP leaders signed an open letter urging their fellow Republicans to stop undermining the elections. Signatories included former Gov. Nathan Deal and former U.S. Sens Johnny Isakson and Saxby Chambliss. Impact on turnout? While many Republicans are concerned, it's not yet clear what sort of impact the conspiracy theories will have on voter turnout. Disinformation experts emphasize that mistrust of American elections long predates 2020. \"But we have seen it be exacerbated in this particular election,\" said David Levine, a fellow with the Alliance for Securing Democracy, part of the German Marshall Fund of the United States. \"One of the things that was interesting about the November general election is that we saw such high turnout in spite of the vast amounts of false information.\" In front of the Georgia Capitol, surrounded by American flags and pro-Trump merchandise, Missy Landers said she still plans to vote next month. \"It is my right as an American citizen to vote and I'm gonna honor that right by voting,\" she said. Republicans will have to hope her faith in the system remains solid enough through Election Day on Jan. 5.",

But some worry that such messaging could harm the party's chances in the upcoming Georgia Senate runoffs.  MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: Some high-profile supporters of Donald Trump are spreading conspiracy theories, telling Georgia Republicans not to vote in the crucial U.S. Senate runoff there next month. Those runoffs will determine which party controls the Senate. Here's lawyer Lin Wood earlier today. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LIN WOOD: Do not be fooled twice. This is Georgia. We ain't dumb. We're not going to go vote on January 5 on another machine made by China. You're not going to fool Georgians again.

HAGEN: She's the kind of reliable Republican voter Georgia's GOP establishment is counting on to hold the two Senate seats. But weeks after President-elect Joe Biden's win over President Trump, Landers says her faith in Georgia's election has been shaken. LANDERS: With all of the news about the ballots, the vote, the electronic systems, all the different things that happened during the election and is continuing to come out - but I don't feel secure about it. HAGEN: She's heard these theories from a number of right-wing media outlets and personalities. LANDERS: I listen to Tucker Carlson, Newsmax. HAGEN: OK. LANDERS: I love David Harris, you know, Terrance, all these guys. HAGEN: Georgia's Republican election officials say there's no evidence of any widespread fraud and say these conspiracy theories are crazy and like a game of whack-a-mole.

The president-elect flipped Erie County back into Democrats' column.\n                \n                    \n                    Roberto Schmidt/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Joe Biden speaks to union members in Erie, Pa., on Oct. 10. The president-elect flipped Erie County back into Democrats' column. Even as President Trump continues to undermine the election results that made Joe Biden the president-elect, states have begun certifying their votes. In some places, it's been controversial, as in Wayne County in Michigan, where the canvassing board initially deadlocked 2-2 along party lines, before the Republican members reversed course and certified the election results. There were no such problems last week in Erie County, Pennsylvania. The election was close there \u2014 Biden won by just 1,424 votes, flipping the county back to Democrats \u2014 but the local board of elections praised the vote as being well-run and organized. And the seven-member board, made up of four Democrats and three Republicans, voted unanimously to approve the result and send it to the state. So with the books now closed on the election in Erie, we decided to check in with some Biden supporters in the county whom we'd encountered earlier in the campaign. To a person, the tension has melted away \u2014 even with Trump refusing to concede. \"Walking on sunshine, man\" Take Michael Keys, a city councilor in Erie. When we first met after Labor Day, he was a bit stressed. Now, with the election over, his greeting is beyond effusive. \"I'm walking on sunshine, man!\" he says as he greets me in the lobby of the Booker T. Washington Community Center in Erie. We're both wearing masks. His has a message in big, bold letters stretched across his mouth. It reads: \"VOTERS DECIDE.\" Michael Keys is a city councilor in Erie.\n                \n                    \n                    Don Gonyea/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption In September, Keys was working hard to turn out the African American vote in the city of Erie. Now he's quoting the lyric of that pop song from the 1980s, and he's full of optimism. He says right off that he doesn't expect Biden to fix everything. But he does see a path for the new president to not only spread some hope, but also opportunity. \"It's my hope we'll be able to foster more inclusion and more equitable policies,\" Keys says. \"We have to have equity, you know; that's one of the things that the Trump plan left out was equity.\" Another big hope for Keys is that there'll be investment in America's cities, to create jobs and to reform police departments. He says the issues raised by the killings of George Floyd and others must be addressed, and that he expects Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris to be committed to that. He then mentions the 1994 crime bill, which then-Sen. Biden authored, and which sent so many African Americans to prison, often with long, mandatory sentences. \"You know,\" he says, \"it would be ironic that the same people who put together the '94 crime bill, and worked under the '94 crime bill, would be the same people who dismantle it. That would be my dream.\" A vote for governing from the center Maryann Frontino is a 65-year-old lifelong Republican who left the party and switched her registration to independent this summer, because of Trump. Maryann Frontino left the Republican Party this year.\n                \n                    \n                    Don Gonyea/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Looking ahead to Jan. 20, when Biden is sworn in, she thinks the change will be dramatic. \"It's probably going to feel more like a traditional presidency where we have friendly relations with our allies instead of combative relationships with them,\" she says. Frontino adds that she expects the U.S. to rejoin the Paris Agreement on climate change, and to resume productive dialogue across the Atlantic. As for Washington politics, she acknowledges that hardcore partisanship and gridlock will persist. She adds, however: \"My expectation is that it's going to be, at least on [Biden's] part, a kinder, friendlier and more professional presidency.\" Frontino says she hopes Biden will govern from the center, and that maybe, she says, \"at least a few Republicans will be willing to work with him.\"  And she hopes progressive Democrats give the new president room to find compromise. \"I think it is bigger than Joe Biden\" In talking to Biden voters, you often hear hope but not much confidence that there really is an opportunity for the new president to unify the country. Scott Slawson heads the United Electrical Local 506 union in Erie. His members work at the WABTEC locomotive assembly plant where, according to Slawson, you can see the political divisions even on the shop floor. He applauds Biden for talking about unity, and about addressing the deep distrust people often have of those who vote differently than they do. \"I strongly believe that it's something that we have to fix,\" says the union leader. \"We have to figure out how we unite as individuals, as families, as a country.\" It's something Trump never even attempted, he says. He says Biden is certainly more suited to the task, but then Slawson says, \"You know, I think it is bigger than Joe Biden, but it takes somebody to start that, that sparks start that flame. Right?\" Slawson says it's important Biden doesn't give up on the challenge of bringing the country together. And given the pandemic and the economic struggles as a result of it, he says the incentive should be there for people to want to find solutions and to want the new president to succeed.",

Phil Brach spent the weekend putting huge sheets of plywood up over the massive glass windows of the Washington, D.C., store where he works, Rodman's Food and Drug, in preparation for Election Day. \"We'll probably go up two or three boards high,\" Brach says. Across the country, there are growing concerns that the bitterness and animosity over the presidential election will not end when the polls close Tuesday night. From coast to coast, cities are preparing for possible protests, civil unrest and violence regardless of the election's outcome. Brach is working alongside his boss, Nolan Rodman, the third generation of his family to run the store that his grandfather first opened in 1955 as a pharmacy. It now includes a cafe, produce, beer, wine and food items from around the world. On May 31, Rodman says he was caught unprepared when rioters broke in and looted his business during the height of protests over the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis that sparked demonstrations nationwide. \"They threw a chair through our window; there was chaos happening everywhere,\" Rodman says. \"I was very scared that night. It was pretty horrifying.\" After Rodman's was ransacked, Nolan Rodman says he couldn't sleep for a week. Nolan Rodman stands in front of the boarded-up Rodman's Food and Drug in Washington.

Cities across the country are preparing for possible protests, civil unrest and violence regardless of the election's outcome. This time around they have a plan Rodman says he went to the store the night of the looting along with a police officer who advised him to leave. Security cameras caught mostly young men going into the pharmacy and the beer and wine section of the store. He and his father, Roy Rodman, even stayed in the store a few nights. The elder Rodman says this time around they have a plan. \"We put some film on these windows so that they're not easily broken; if they're smashed, they'll stay in place. And we're hoping that no one can break into the store, at least not easily,\" Roy Rodman says. His son adds, \"The film makes the glass shatterproof so it doesn't just explode upon contact.\" While the nation's capital is certain to be a focal point of post-election demonstrations, other cities are bracing for possible chaos, too. The National Retail Federation has held training webinars for members on crisis prevention and the de-escalation of conflict and has hired security consultants to help store owners prepare. Many storefront windows along Chicago's Michigan Avenue are already boarded up \u2013 as some retailers there have been looted this summer, not just once but twice. \"Coming off of the summer, seeing the looting that occurred, there's a lot of anxiety,\" says Elliot Richardson, who heads the Small Business Advocacy Council in Chicago. \"There's a lot of nervousness about what might happen now, what might happen during the election.\" Richardson says it's not just the high-end retailers on the Magnificent Mile downtown that are at risk, but also the mom and pop shops on the South and the West sides of Chicago, which he says \"are hanging on by a thread right now because of the pandemic.\" The city of Chicago has barricades ready to try to keep protesters away from Trump Tower if necessary.\n                \n                    \n                    David Schaper/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption The city of Chicago has barricades ready to try to keep protesters away from Trump Tower if necessary. \"They cannot afford to be looted. They cannot afford destruction, because if that happens, they very well may close and not reopen,\" Richardson says. \"Channel those emotions into peaceful and productive expressions\" Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot says the city has been planning and preparing for potential election-related protests and civil unrest for months. \"We all know that emotions will be high because they already are,\" the mayor says, \"and I urge you to channel those emotions into peaceful and productive expressions.\" Like other cities, Chicago has been running tabletop exercises and gaming out how, when and where violence might erupt. Days off for police officers are canceled, and the city will flood certain areas with a highly visible police presence to deter violence. The city will also be using snowplows, dump trucks and other heavy vehicles to block certain streets and expressway exit ramps to keep demonstrators away. Police Superintendent David Brown says Chicago police will respect people's rights to protest peacefully and will work first and foremost to de-escalate any confrontations, but he adds that his officers will take swift action against anyone intent on spreading chaos. \"The message is, don't loot in Chicago. If you do loot, you will be held accountable. If you escape, we will find you and bring you to justice,\" says Brown, with a seriousness in his voice. In Beverly Hills, Calif., tensions already felt high this weekend.

Police are planning to shut down Rodeo Drive on Tuesday and Wednesday, but one small business owner who is not boarding up is Steve White, a 47-year-old Army veteran who attended the rally wearing fatigues and a Kevlar vest. \"I've been buying weapons and guns ever since the first riots hit, so I'm definitely prepared for it,\" White says. He owns a business on Wilshire Boulevard. \"I'm worried about it, but I'm just going to camp out there every night and defend my own business.\" Trump supporters march in front of a boarded-up business in Beverly Hills.\n                \n                    \n                    Liz Baker/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Trump supporters march in front of a boarded-up business in Beverly Hills. Groups on all sides of the political spectrum are planning election night demonstrations, and the possibility that results might not be known for days or weeks after Election Day could escalate tensions. But Indiana University political science professor Ore Koren, who studies political unrest globally, says mass organized political violence is not a part of the American psyche. \"We just don't do this in this country. We have lone wolves. We can have some rioting,\" he says, \"but in terms of actual massive violence, this is not something we have done before.\" That said, 2020 is already a year of political tension and unrest unlike anything seen in the country since the 1960s, and the only certainty seems to be how difficult it is to predict what may happen next.",

            "article_content": "As the nation careens into the 2020 presidential election amid a damaged economy and a surging pandemic that has infected more than 9 million people and killed more than 230,000, Americans are facing historic division. The divides have affected the country in myriad ways \u2014 even influencing who we choose to engage with. In one survey by the Pew Research Center, 47% of Republicans and 71% of Democrats said they \"wouldn't want to date someone who voted for the candidate of the opposing party in the 2016 presidential election.\" This polarization has left many worried that the results of Tuesday's election will lead to conflict that risks spiraling into violence. Experts in global conflict are warning that such a scenario is a real possibility. In cities like Los Angeles, New York and Washington, D.C., businesses have begun to board up their windows in case of civil unrest. So how can Americans move past their differences and find a way to heal their divides? Over the past four weeks, that question has been at the center of a series of conversations by NPR's All Things Considered. Host Michel Martin spoke with people who've led truth and reconciliation commissions; experts who help communities heal from loss and deep division; violence interrupters who try to break cycles of violence and retaliation; and those working on peace programs with youth from around the world. Their experiences were all unique, but they spoke of common themes of truth, difficult conversations, listening and understanding. Healing is possible, they say, but people have to be willing to try.

It would be four years before she saw her again. \"When they drove us away from the reservation, they drove me away from the only thing I'd known my whole life,\" Altvater says. \"And for four years, the foster parents tortured us and the state left us there.\" Decades later, Altvater co-founded the Maine Wabanaki-State Child Welfare Truth and Reconciliation Commission, a body convened to address a history in Maine of taking Native American children from their homes and placing them in foster care or adopting them to white families. Truth commissions most famously worked in Northern Ireland and post-apartheid South Africa to help bring about accountability for past atrocities. Though little known, similar commissions have been formed in the U.S. The commission set up in response to what happened to Maine's native children is one example. The commission established following the Greensboro Massacre of 1979 is another. Reverend Nelson Johnson was among those injured during the massacre, when members of the Ku Klux Klan attacked peaceful civil rights marchers with the apparent complicity of local law enforcement. Five people were killed. \"It's difficult to heal trauma without truth telling ... You have to uncover and acknowledge what has been done wrong before you can fully move forward.\" Mark Sills Some 20 years after the massacre, Johnson set out to establish the Greensboro Truth and Reconciliation Commission with the Rev. Mark Sills. Johnson says that many people thought \"we were responsible for our own deaths,\" but that creating the commission opened the door for change. At a time of deep division in America, Altvater, Johnson and Sills say there are clear lessons to be learned from the truth and reconciliation processes they participated in. \"There is a fact that truth commissions exemplify that cannot be denied, and that is it's difficult to heal trauma without truth telling,\" Sills says. \"You have to uncover and acknowledge what has been done wrong before you can fully move forward.\" Altvater says that for her, the most important part of the process was \"having the space where my voice and others voices could be heard and believed in a place where we knew that something was going to happen ... It was so life changing to tell your story in that type of an atmosphere.\" Johnson says that the importance lies in teaching people the truth. \"There is a truth that Native Americans' land was stolen and they were nearly annihilated as a people,\" he says. \"It is true that women were devalued and still devalued. These are truths that are deep and enduring unless, first of all, we acknowledge this depth of truth.\" In 2012, after the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School, Rich Harwood set out to help the community in Newtown, Conn. heal and rebuild. Harwood is the president and founder of the Harwood Institute for Public Innovation, a nonprofit dedicated to building community and effecting positive change. In Newtown, Harwood found there was an overabundance of division about how to move forward from the massacre. Complicating matters, he says, was a 28-person task force of elected officials from four governing boards that turned the town's despair into \"a political disaster, for attention, for acrimony, for divisiveness.\" His job was to work as a mediator and organizer to help everyone come to a solution they could support. \"When I was asked to go in, it was about whether they should rebuild the school where it is, start on some other site, and what I discovered really quickly was that the challenge is much more profound,\" says Harwood. \"The challenge is whether or not the community could pivot from trauma and despair to healing and hope.\" \"There's no magic wand that we can wave and correct all of the challenges that we face today ... It's going to take us taking small steps forward.\" Rich Harwood Harwood sees the divisiveness in the U.S. today and says those tensions exist because people aren't feeling understood. \"We need to understand the human dimensions of this,\" he says. \"Why do divides exist? I think they exist because people feel aggrieved, because they haven't felt seen and heard, because they feel as though their dignity has been stripped from them, that they feel trapped. And when people feel these things, they hunker down and protect themselves, build walls and form smaller and smaller groups that they belong to where they want to fight it out with other groups.\" He says it's crucial to \"not simply sit in that pain and sorrow,\" but to start envisioning a different path and how to get there. That's what happened in Clark County, Kentucky, he says, when he met two women who went from sitting in their local church and listening about drug addiction, to starting a program to create coaches for people going through the recovery process. Harwood has been working to reconcile differences within communities for 30 years. He calls 2020 a uniquely challenging moment, in that the nation is facing four crises simultaneously: a pandemic, economic upheaval, systemic racism and social injustice and a political crisis. \"There's no magic wand that we can wave and correct all of the challenges that we face today,\" he says. \"It's going to take us taking small steps forward, rebuilding our trust, restoring our belief in ourselves and one another and knowing that we can get things done together.\" Tyree Head says he \"grew up rough\" in Chicago. When he came home from prison, he says he felt that he owed it to the other kids who grew up like he did to \"teach them to try and change the norm and let them know the flip-side to the coin to the life that they live in now.\" So he attended training at the Metropolitan Peace Academy, which teaches street outreach workers how to help break the cycle of street violence and retaliation that can end with people being killed. Head, who now works as a violence interrupter at the Institute for Nonviolence Chicago, says the program teaches its students that \"hurt people, hurt people.\" \"There's a lot of hurt people walking out here in society for whatever reason,\" Head says. \"So me working with these individuals on a day to day basis, I build a rapport and a bond, so that helps. And nothing is a facade. My heart is open. The way I come to them, they understand, they relate, because they know I walked the same path they walked. I'm now trying to divert the path so it won't be identical to mine. That pays dividends.\" Troy Harden helped to develop the curriculum for the Metropolitan Peace Academy. A professor of sociology and the director of the Race and Ethnic Studies Institute at Texas A&M University, he says the success of the program is owed in large part to credible messengers like Head. \"Every human being not only has a right to exist but has certain rights on this earth.\" Troy Harden \"Tyree works to establish relationships before the incidents actually happen,\" Harden says. \"And many of the relationships go back a very long time. People who know him and both his former and current life and have seen the change that he is. One of our core philosophies is 'be the change that you want to see.'\" Asked to imagine the country as two people on the street locked in a bitter fight that could escalate to violence, both Head and Harden say there are lessons from the work of violence interrupters that can be used to break cycles of mistrust and mutual animosity. \"Part of it is acknowledging the harm that's happened and really being able to see that there are different interests that people might have, but they're also mutual interests that people have,\" says Harden. \"I would argue that we're at a turning point in our society where we can begin to recognize the harm that's been created historically and really begin the process of healing that through realizing that every human being not only has a right to exist but has certain rights on this earth.\" \"Love cures all of that,\" Head says. The Seeds of Peace summer camp in Maine first brought together Israeli and Palestinian teenagers in 1993. Now, the camp and its year-round programs facilitate conversations between young people from all over the world \u2014 Israel and the Palestinian territories, India, Afghanistan, Iraq, Bosnia and even the U.S. The camp brings those young people together for an intense summer of physical activities, talking and listening to create friendships between people whose forebears have been locked in deadly conflicts for generations. Twenty years ago, Spencer Traylor was part of a class of attendees who came to the camp from the U.S. \u2014 he was part of a group of teenagers from Maine that was experiencing tension with the arrival of East African immigrants. He says the program was \"confusing at first,\" because he was just \"a kid from northern Maine\" comparing his struggles to a Palestinian camper \"who's experienced significant loss because of a conflict.\" Traylor, who is now a history teacher and the co-founder of Next STEP, an alternative high school program, says the experience fundamentally reshaped his view of conflict resolution. \"When we encourage the airing of those conflicts, even if it's messy, even if it is scary, if the shared purpose is trying to understand and be understood, it can bring people together.\" Eliza O'Neil He says there is a pervasive idea in society that if you open up conflict, it's going to disrupt a community and cause divisions, so it's best to keep quiet. Seeds of Peace takes a different approach, encouraging participants to have uncomfortable conversations in order to quell divisions. \"You have to talk about divisions,\" Traylor says. \"You have to talk about conflict in order to have a functional community. And you have to create methods and give tools and resources for young people and adults to be able to have those conversations in ways that are productive and constructive and in ways that people can start to see and understand each other rather than try to hide their feelings and thoughts away from each other.\" Eliza O'Neil, one of the directors of Seeds of Peace, says that one of the biggest takeaways from the program is a \"paradigm shift around navigating conflict.\" \"Being misunderstood, mischaracterized, right in front of your eyes is extremely painful,\" O'Neil says. \"But what we've found is that when we encourage the airing of those conflicts, even if it's messy, even if it is scary, if the shared purpose is trying to understand and be understood, it can bring people together. And then I think a key part of it is that no matter how heated or upsetting the session had been that day, everyone shows up the next day. They're still friends.\" O'Neil says that it's powerful for people to see that you can have a disagreement and still keep a relationship intact, and that the knowledge that this is possible brings \"a sense of openness and willingness to engage and courage in future conversations with those who disagree with them.\" Interviews for this series were produced by Janaya Williams and edited by Tinbete Ermyas and William Troop.",

            "article_content": "If you find yourself fighting with a friend over politics, or frustrated and furious with your nearest and dearest over whom they're supporting for president, you're hardly alone. A recent survey shows just how much the nation's bitter political divide is causing social splintering and taking a toll on friendships. Even decades-long relationships have been caving under the pressure, giving new meaning to \"social distancing.\" \"I did straight up say, 'Dude, I'm done. Lose my number,' \" said Shama Davis from Los Angeles, recalling when he \"unfriended\" a guy he'd been friends with since high school 25 years ago. \"I just hung up on my end and proceeded to just block him in every possible way,\" said Joni Jensen from New York, still fuming over the guy she felt compelled to dump. And betraying just a tinge of regret about cutting off his cousins, Ricardo Deforest of Tampa, Fla., conceded, \"I hate to say it because family is everything,\" before unabashedly proclaiming, \"I disowned them. In my mind they're not family anymore.\" They are among the many Americans for whom political rifts have deepened. It's one thing to disagree about something such as tax policy, they said. But they see their differences now as ones of basic morality, core values and character, and that cannot be overlooked. Davis, 42, a consultant who is Black, said he simply could not abide his friend downplaying police brutality, and harping instead on the looting and violence happening amid the mostly peaceful protests. \"I told him, 'If this is your attitude, we can't be cool anymore,' \" Davis said. \" 'I don't respect you now. I don't. Because people are really dying.' \" Jensen, a retired professor, also sees it as a moral absolute. As a sexual assault survivor, she said, she couldn't stand it when the guy she'd been close to for 40 years was being cavalier about the allegations against President Trump's then-Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. (Kavanaugh vehemently denied the sexual assault allegations.) \"He was going off like, 'Oh, you drank the Kool-Aid,' and 'Kavanaugh didn't do anything,' \" she recalled. \"It made me sick. If this is his core ethics, I don't want that kind of person in my life.\" Conservatives can be just as quick to spurn the liberals in their lives who clash with their core values, such as life and liberty \u2014 which is the biggie for Deforest. \"They sold our country out,\" Deforest, a 61-year-old steelworker, said of those on the left of the political spectrum. \"This election is about the soul of what America is. You can't be a free country and be a socialist state at the same time.\" He said the acrimony he's feeling from what he calls \"hardcore Trump haters\" was as much a factor in his decision to cut them off as their differences that gave rise to it. \"All they can do is say, 'Trump is a racist. Orange man bad! Orange man racist!  They're blowing spittle, and [their] veins popping out of their heads,\" he said. \"Yo soy Latino. But [they assume] I'm some sort of horrible racist because I like Trump. It's ridiculous!\" Jocelyn Kiley, associate director of research at the Pew Research Center, said political polarization is more intense now than at any point in modern history. Nearly 80% of Americans now have \"just a few\" or no friends at all across the aisle, according to Pew. And the animosity goes both ways. \"Democrats are a little bit more likely to say they'd end a friendship\" Kiley said. \"But Republicans may be less likely to say they have friends on the other side. So it may not be all that differential.\" Another recent poll by the Public Religion Research Institute shows that 8 in 10 Republicans believe the Democratic Party has been taken over by socialists, while 8 in 10 Democrats believe the Republican Party has been taken over by racists. The report is aptly named titled \"Dueling Realities.\" Tania Israel, a professor in the counseling, clinical and school psychology department at the University of California, Santa Barbara, said she's seeing more of those kinds of distorted views in the workshops she runs on cross-the-aisle conversations. The rancor is rising, she said, as both sides \"tend to view the other as being more extreme than they actually are.\" Another thing conservatives and liberals have in common, she said, is that they all suffer from big blind spots when it comes to the morality of their own side.  They tend to view themselves as eminently fair and right, and the other side as irrational. Case in point: Explaining his politics, Deforest noted, \"When I say all these things, I think I sound fairly reasonable,\" while declaiming the other side with, \"There's something wrong with these people.\" Jensen, meanwhile, is just as certain, upbraiding the guy she was arguing with as \"brainwashed.\" A little more listening to understand, a little less trying to convince, and a lot more intellectual humility would do everyone a world of good, said Israel, who's also the author of Beyond Your Bubble: How to Connect Across the Political Divide, Skills and Strategies for Conversations That Work. \"We're flattening people out in terms of our view of them,\" she said, \"and we're not really seeing the full complexity of people on the other side.\" It's exactly what Jon Langford, 28, a Georgia truck driver, said he experienced when his brother, who is gay, wrongly assumed the worst about him. \"He went off on me saying essentially I'm a racist and a homophobe just because I'm a Trump supporter. No ifs, ands or buts. And he completely cut me out of his life,\" Langford said. They haven't spoken in years. Now, Langford said, he's determined not to do the same thing to his friends across the aisle, including his best friend, who supports former Vice President Joe Biden. As Langford sees it, no one has a monopoly on morality. \"I could assume that anybody that supports Biden is a firm believer that it's OK to murder a baby,\" he said. \"But I don't.\" Another conservative, Judith Margolis Friedman, may be one of the few who can claim that she's managed not to lose any friends over politics. But she said that's because she kept her political views secret for fear of \"social suicide.\" \"I would politely nod and go along to avoid conflict [...] with people whose relationships I valued,\" she said. Instead, Friedman vented in a secret Facebook group that she said was a \"safe space\" where she could \"commiserate with other people who also feel shut out from their regular life because of their views.\" But this month, Friedman couldn't take it anymore and \"came out of the closet,\" deciding that if people dumped her over her politics, \"they weren't real friends after all.\" She's hoping friends will give more weight to the person they've known for years, than whom she chooses to vote for. \"If someone expresses a more conservative worldview, they're immediately called a Nazi and a racist and a misogynist and a homophobe and everything under the sun,\" Friedman said. \"I'm none of those things. I'm just a normal friggin' person who has a different point of view.\" At the other end of the political spectrum, Jeff Marinstein, a business and technology consultant from Connecticut, has also been trying to get past the ever-intensifying invective and insults from \"friends.\" One, in particular, kept attacking him as a \"libtard,\" among other things. Marinstein no longer talks to that guy. But with another, he's trying a new strategy to save the friendship, suggesting they keep talking, just not about politics. So far, it's proving harder to enforce than he thought. \"I'm still getting this nightly stream of New York Post articles and memes [mocking] Democrats, and I simply respond with a funny line that says, 'This post violates our agreement not to talk about politics,' trying to creatively send the message that I just don't want to engage,\" he said. Whether the strategy ultimately works or not, Marinstein said, he wonders whether it may ultimately be doing as much harm as good. \"It just feels like the healthiest thing for me to do at the moment [is] to lower the temperature and to not continue these toxic conversations,\" he said. \"But I suppose the risk is that I'm just retreating into my own information bubble with people who think just like me.\" Indeed, experts said it's more conversation \u2014 not less \u2014 that's needed, if the nation is to heal its blistering divide. But it has to be healthy, productive conversation. And Israel, who runs the workshops on civil discourse, said the first step must be to take it off social media and talk in person instead. \"The only useful comment that you can make on somebody's social media post is 'Can we find a time to talk about this? I'm interested in hearing more,' \" she said.",

In a call that included a number of \"tense moments,\" Postmaster General Louis DeJoy sought to reassure a group of the nation's top election officials Thursday that election mail will be his agency's highest priority this fall, according to one state election official on the call. Specifically, DeJoy told the officials that his agency was undertaking a public information campaign to explain to voters that the U.S. Postal Service is equipped to handle the expected increase in mail volume that comes during election season, according to New Mexico Secretary of State Maggie Toulouse Oliver, who leads the National Association of Secretaries of State, which organized the call. DeJoy also talked more in depth about training for Postal Service employees about how to handle election mail, including postmarking, which in some jurisdictions needs to happen for a mail ballot to count. \"We're at the 'trust but verify' point,\" said Toulouse Oliver, a Democrat. \"We will be taking [the Postal Service] at their word that they are going to put these much-needed processes and guidelines into place. And only through ongoing communication and accountability will we be able to be assured.\" \"Better in the future\" The implementation of the aforementioned information campaign got off to a rocky start, with one state election official even calling postcards the USPS sent out last week \"misinformation.\" The cards urge voters to \"plan ahead\" if they expect to vote by mail this fall, which is a message consistent with what officials nationwide have tried to relay. But the cards also tell voters to \"Request your mail-in ballot ... at least 15 days before Election Day\" \u2014 a message that has alarmed officials in states where ballots are automatically sent out to registered voters, like Colorado, Utah and Washington, and where voters might be then confused about whether they need to make a request. \"I just found out the @USPS is sending this postcard to every household and PO Box in the nation,\" tweeted Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold, a Democrat, last Friday, with an image of the card. \"For states like Colorado where we send ballots to all voters, the information is not just confusing, it's WRONG.\" Secretaries of State asked @USPS Postmaster General DeJoy to review a draft before election information was sent to voters to ensure accuracy. But he refused. Now millions of postcards with misinformation are printed & being mailed to voters. On Thursday's call, DeJoy said the fact that election officials didn't proofread the mailers before they were sent to millions of people was a mistake and he promised to do \"better in the future,\" according to Toulouse Oliver. She said there were multiple \"tense\" moments during the questioning period about the postcards. But that issue, which culminated in a lawsuit and a judge temporarily blocking the mailing of the cards in Colorado on Saturday, is just the latest in a string of USPS mishaps over the past few months. The agency has been mired in controversy virtually since DeJoy, a former logistics executive and prominent Republican Party donor, took over in June. The urgency around those concerns grew after he instituted policy changes later in the summer. DeJoy has disputed the specific changes he made, but regardless, mail delays followed shortly thereafter, leading to bipartisan calls for him to reverse the changes. He did so, and on Thursday, a federal district judge in Washington state also ordered the changes be halted. Speaking from the bench on Thursday, that judge, Stanley Bastian, said the changes were a \"politically motivated attack\" on the efficiency of the Postal Service, according to The Associated Press. DeJoy faced similar accusations during congressional hearings last month and ardently denied that his moves were about anything more than trying to right the ship at a federal agency operating on a multibillion-dollar annual shortfall. Regardless, mail is still being delivered at a slower-than-average pace than it was at the beginning of the pandemic, according to a tracker maintained by The New York Times. Most of those delays are by only a single day, but the general air of doubt hanging over the Postal Service may push some voters, especially Democrats, to vote in person instead of by mail this fall. A CNBC/Change Research poll in late August found an 11 percentage-point decline in the share of Democrats nationwide who said they planned to vote by mail, compared with a poll taken two weeks before the changes at the Postal Service became well-known. Toulouse Oliver called the conversation Thursday \"extremely productive\" and said she's optimistic that DeJoy appears to be making more of an effort to communicate with the public and election officials about policies he is implementing. \"We have to take the election process out of the realm of toxic partisan rhetoric and make sure that voters have the best information possible to make their decisions about how, where and when to cast their ballot,\" she said.",

Updated at 7 a.m. ET Saturday John Lewis \u2014 an icon of the civil rights movement, congressman and, for decades, a force in Democratic politics \u2014 died at age 80 on Friday. Lewis had been treated for advanced-stage pancreatic cancer after being diagnosed during a routine medical exam. He publicly disclosed his diagnosis in late December. \"He was honored and respected as the conscience of the US Congress and an icon of American history, but we knew him as a loving father and brother,\" Lewis' family said in a statement. \"He was a stalwart champion in the on-going struggle to demand respect for the dignity and worth of every human being.  He dedicated his entire life to non-violent activism and was an outspoken advocate in the struggle for equal justice in America.  He will be deeply missed.\" \"The world has lost a legend; the civil rights movement has lost an icon,\" the Congressional Black Caucus said in a statement Friday evening. Former President Barack Obama said that Lewis was one of his heroes and that the congressman \"risked his life and his blood\" for his country and \"inspired generations that followed to try to live up to his example.\" Obama and Lewis recently attended a virtual town hall with young activists leading the demonstrations for racial equality following the police killing of George Floyd. Lewis spoke privately to Obama after the event, saying he was proud of the new generation's activism. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., called Lewis one of the \"greatest heroes of American history,\" a man whose \"goodness, faith and bravery transformed our nation.\" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said: \"Our great nation's history has only bent towards justice because great men like John Lewis took it upon themselves to help bend it.\" \"Some kind of fight\" Lewis began his nearly 60-year career in public service leading sit-ins at segregated lunch counters in the Jim Crow-era South. He elevated that fight for freedom and equality with a speech on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial at the 1963 March on Washington and tested his own resolve as he and other peaceful protesters were violently beaten in 1965 while crossing the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Ala.

Lewis called it a moral obligation to stand up for his beliefs. That drive for service motivated him to run for Congress, where he represented the Atlanta area in the U.S. House for more than 30 years. He continued to work after his diagnosis, pledging to face advanced-stage cancer the same way he met the other great challenges of his life: by refusing to back down. \"I have been in some kind of fight \u2014 for freedom, equality, basic human rights   \u2014 for nearly my entire life. I have never faced a fight quite like the one I have now,\" Lewis said in a December statement announcing his diagnosis. \"I have decided to do what I know to do and do what I have always done: I am going to fight it and keep fighting for the Beloved Community. We still have many bridges to cross.\" Lewis was known throughout his career not only for his dedication to equality and justice but also for his unique and moving oratory. He was revered by his colleagues in Congress for his ability to capture a moment and inspire others to action, a skill he honed from his earliest days. In a 2004 interview with the nonprofit Academy of Achievement, Lewis recalled how preaching to chickens on his family farm in Troy, Ala., prepared him for a life in Washington. \"I say now, when I look back on it, some of these chickens would bow their heads. Some of these chickens would shake their heads,\" Lewis laughed. \"They never quite said 'Amen,' but they tended to listen to me much better than some of my colleagues listen to me today in the Congress, and some of those chickens were a little more productive. At least they produced eggs.\" The foundation of faith that had him preaching in chicken coops also drew Lewis to the weekly radio sermons of Martin Luther King Jr. Lewis recalled in a 2009 interview with Fresh Air's Terry Gross that those early broadcasts helped inspire his future activism. \"I was so inspired by Dr. King that in 1956, with some of my brothers and sisters and first cousins \u2014 I was only 16 years old \u2014 we went down to the public library trying to check out some books, and we were told by the librarian that the library was for whites only and not for coloreds,\" Lewis said. \"It was a public library.\" He didn't set foot in that library again until 40 years later \u2014 to sign copies of his own memoir. He said the 1956 experience set him on a course toward the civil rights movement. Lewis went on to study the techniques of nonviolent protest while attending what's now known as the American Baptist College in Nashville, Tenn. In the summer of 1961, he and other students protested at segregated lunch counters and later joined the famous Freedom Rides. By his early 20s, Lewis was head of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, and in 1963, he joined King as a speaker at the March on Washington. He spoke on voting rights and the future of the Democratic Party. His speech was brief, lasting less than eight minutes, but his words influenced a generation of activists. \"To those who have said, 'Be patient and wait,' \" he said, \"we must say that we must not be patient. We do not want our freedom gradually, but we want to be free now.\" Civil rights leader John Lewis speaks during a news conference in Jackson, Miss., on June 23, 1964.\n                \n                    \n                    Jim Bourdier/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Lewis took action again two years later in 1965 in a march from Selma to Montgomery, Ala. In his interview with Fresh Air, Lewis remembered leading peaceful marchers onto the Edmund Pettus Bridge to protest voter registration. There, they met Alabama state troopers. \"In less than a minute and a half, the major said, 'Troopers advance,' \" Lewis recalled. \"And you saw these men putting on their gas masks. They came toward us beating us with bullwhips, nightsticks, [charging at] us with horses and releasing the tear gas. I was hit in the head by a state trooper with a nightstick. I thought I was going to die.\" It came to be known as Bloody Sunday, and news images from that day were fresh in the minds of lawmakers as the seminal Voting Rights Act became law that same year. \"We changed that\" Later, Lewis would make an annual pilgrimage to the bridge to honor that day. The event became a rite of passage for Democrats running for office, particularly in 2007 when then-Sen. Barack Obama was vying to become the nation's first African American president. The pair repeated that walk several times, and in 2011, Obama presented Lewis with the Presidential Medal of Freedom. In his speech, Obama said Lewis had been asking himself two questions his entire life: \"If not us, then who? If not now, then when?\" Then-President Barack Obama hugs Rep.

Lewis had become a national figure again in 1986 when he was elected to represent the Atlanta area in the House of Representatives. There, he pursued legislation on major Democratic priorities, including civil rights, health care and gun control. Lewis was known among lawmakers for his commanding voice and delivery that helped transform routine House floor speeches into calls to action. He used that skill to push fellow Democrats to speak up and cause what he called \"good trouble.\" This is what he did in 2016 following the mass shooting at Pulse Nightclub in Orlando, Fla. On the morning of June 22, Lewis began a speech on the House floor, surrounded by more than a dozen of his fellow lawmakers. \"The time for silence and patience is long gone,\" he said. \"We are calling on the leadership of the House to bring common-sense gun control legislation to the House floor, give us a vote. Where is the heart of this body, where is our soul? Where is our moral leadership? Where is our courage?\" It was the start of a two-day sit-in to demand votes on a series of gun control measures. Democrats remained on the House floor, even after Republican leaders closed the House session and cut off the ever-present C-SPAN video feed. Democrats stayed there for two days, ultimately failing to persuade Republicans to schedule the votes. But the moment was a rallying cry for Democrats in the following years as clashes with Republicans increased after the election of Donald Trump. Rep.

John Lewis attends a ceremony in September on Capitol Hill to commemorate the 400th anniversary of the first recorded arrival of enslaved African people in America. Lewis publicly called Trump an illegitimate president before he even took office, citing Russian interference in the 2016 election. Lewis boycotted Trump's inauguration and was a forceful voice in the many House investigations into the Trump administration. As the House prepared to vote to impeach Trump, Lewis compared the moment to other times when he chose to follow his sense of moral obligation. \"When you see something that is not right, not just, not fair, you have a moral obligation to say something, to do something,\" Lewis said on the House floor hours before the vote. \"Our children and their children will ask us: 'What did you do? What did you say?' For some, this vote may be hard, but we have mission and a mandate to be on the right side of history.\" Less than two weeks later, he announced his diagnosis of stage 4 pancreatic cancer. When it came to that final battle, Lewis returned to mantra he repeated on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in 1963: Never stop fighting. In a statement Friday night, Rep. Bobby Rush, D-Ill., said: \"We will certainly miss his trumpeting voice, calling our nation to higher heights and a greater estimation of ourselves.\" Rep.

New Hampshire has served to reinforce or reset the Democratic primary race over the past five decades. Updated at 12:49 p.m. ET Democrats are going to try again. After the Iowa results meltdown, New Hampshire takes center stage Tuesday night. This election is run by the secretary of state's office and not the state party. It's also a more-straightforward primary (with a couple kinks we explain below) rather than a complicated, math-heavy caucus. There is lots at stake, as New Hampshire has served to reinforce or reset the Democratic primary race over the past five decades. As always, be ready for surprises, especially because through the years, a third to half of voters have made up their minds in the last week. Here are some key questions, things to watch and the stakes for the candidates: Is New Hampshire a swing state? First, let's set the table. Yes, in a general election, New Hampshire is very competitive. It went Democratic in the 2016 election, but it was the closest of all states (by raw vote) \u2014 just 2,700 votes separated Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, and Trump's team is closely watching and targeting it in 2020. Sen. Bernie Sanders stops by the Coffee Coffee roasters shop in Salem, N.H., on Monday.\n                \n                    \n                    Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Sen. Bernie Sanders stops by the Coffee Coffee roasters shop in Salem, N.H., on Monday. Why is New Hampshire first? This question comes up repeatedly, because, like Iowa, New Hampshire is not a diverse state. It, too, is more than 90% white. In 2016, 93% of New Hampshire Democratic primary voters were white. It has been first for a very long time \u2014 100 years this year actually. Then, about 50 years ago, New Hampshire passed a law requiring it be first and gave sole power to the secretary of state to set the primary date. Bill Gardner is that secretary of state. He has been in the job about as long as the law has been on the books and has fought against efforts \u2014 Democratic and Republican \u2014 to move it. When is the New Hampshire primary? Polls open at 8 a.m. ET and close, in most places, at 7 p.m. ET. But there are 221 towns in New Hampshire, and they all set their own times. Some scarcely populated towns famously begin voting at midnight to gain attention. But all polls will be closed by 8 p.m. ET. When will we see results? We will start seeing results after 7 p.m. ET for most places, but there will be no calls from the news networks or The Associated Press (which NPR relies on for calls) until at least 8 p.m. ET. At that point, expect the Republican primary (yes, there is one) to be called for President Trump. Sen. Elizabeth Warren hosts a rally at the Rochester Opera House on Monday in Rochester, N.H.\n                \n                    \n                    Scott Olson/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Sen. Elizabeth Warren hosts a rally at the Rochester Opera House on Monday in Rochester, N.H. When will we know who wins? This is always tricky, because, um, Iowa. The state predicts we might know around 9:30 p.m. ET, but stay loose on that one. Check NPR's New Hampshire live blog throughout the day for updated live results. Also, because this is a delegate race, check out our new delegate tracker to see how many delegates are allocated to each candidate and where the race stands now. Speaking of delegates, how many are at stake? Twenty-four pledged delegates. There are nine more automatic delegates, which used to be superdelegates, but they matter less this year because they can't vote on first ballot at the Democratic National Convention unless there's an overwhelming majority for one candidate. Sixteen of the delegates are allocated proportionally by congressional district. (There are two of them.) Another eight are allocated by statewide vote (five at large, three pledged leaders and elected officials). Those odd numbers will be important going forward in states to come because the overall winner essentially gets the extra delegate. That represents just 1% of the total number of delegates available; after New Hampshire, just 2% of total delegates will be allocated (including Iowa). A candidate needs 1,991 delegates to win the nomination, so there's a long way to go. Are there thresholds for getting delegates like there were in Iowa? Yes. Like Iowa, there's a 15% to win any delegates. That's true in every Democratic primary and caucus. The difference in New Hampshire is there is no re-sorting in a second round. You vote, it's done. You get 15%, you get delegates. You don't, well, you don't. Sen. Amy Klobuchar speaks at a town hall in Exeter, N.H., on Monday.

Amy Klobuchar speaks at a town hall in Exeter, N.H., on Monday. She has been climbing in the polls in the past week. How many people actually vote? The record for turnout in the Democratic presidential primary in New Hampshire is about 288,000. That was set in 2008 in the race between Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. The second-highest turnout was in 2016 between Clinton and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders about 251,000. New Hampshire is known for high voter participation. In the 2016 general election, it was actually the third-highest turnout state behind Minnesota and Maine. How does voting work? It's a primary, so voters head to the polls like they would in a general election. It's \"semi-open,\" meaning independents can participate. About 40% of the state are independents, and given that there is no competitive GOP primary happening, one might expect to see a higher percentage of independents turn out on the Democratic side than in 2016. In 2016, independents made up 40% of the electorate, according to the exit polls, but there were competitive primaries on both sides. In 2008, it was 44%, but in 2004 \u2014 the last time there was a competitive Democratic primary with an incumbent Republican president up for reelection \u2014 48% of the electorate was independents. Don't confuse independents with moderates, though. Sanders, who won the 2016 primary by more than 20 points, won three-quarters of independents. He won a slightly lower percentage of self-described moderates, 59%.

Aside from independents, which other voters are important to watch? The shape of the electorate is very important and will get more important as the race winnows and support solidifies. The more liberal the electorate, the better it is for Sanders. And the Democratic electorate in New Hampshire has grown increasingly liberal. In 2004, just 46% who turned out identified as liberal; in 2008, that jumped to 56%, as Obama turned out lots of young and new voters. But in 2016, more than two-thirds (68%) of the New Hampshire Democratic electorate was liberal. If that trend holds, that's good for Sanders. Young voters, under 30, made up about a fifth in 2016, and they broke overwhelmingly for Sanders. The percentage of young voters in 2016 (19%) was actually higher than in 2008 (18%) when Obama ran. Sanders needs that trend to continue, as he wins big margins with young voters. The more white and the more people there are with college degrees voting, the better for former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg. He finished with the delegate lead over Sanders in Iowa, and he hopes to do well again in New Hampshire. With it being 93% white in 2016 and 60% with college degrees, that lines up for Buttigieg. Older voters were roughly a fifth. That number probably needs to be higher to help former Vice President Joe Biden, whose support is declining in the state. And there's no guarantee he even wins them now. He won the highest percentage of voters 65 and older in Iowa, but Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar and Buttigieg won significant shares, too.

Who's ahead in the polls? There have been four poll leaders in New Hampshire during this race. But Sanders is now the favorite. He leads by 7 points in an average of the polls over Buttigieg, who has surged since Iowa. But this is New Hampshire, where things can change quickly and a third or more tend to say they made up their mind in the last week. Remember, Obama had an 8-point lead in the polls over Clinton in 2008 and lost the primary by less than 3 points, so be prepared for anything to happen. What's at stake for the candidates? Everything. Here are some things in particular to look for: 1. Can Sanders expand his base? Sanders was promising high turnout in Iowa, but it didn't happen. Turnout was more on pace with 2016 than 2008. That's not exactly a groundswell of support and an overwhelming movement. But New Hampshire is Take 2 for Sanders and the rest. Can they show they have fired up Democrats enough to take on Trump this year? Sanders did well in urban areas and college towns. He needs to show he can reach beyond that. The Democratic Party doesn't need help winning in those places. Still, a win would be a win, and Sanders would be in the pole position for the nomination if he takes the state, especially considering that moderates and establishment Democrats don't appear to be coalescing around anyone any time soon. 2. For Buttigieg, New Hampshire is nice, but ... Again, New Hampshire is a very white state, and Buttigieg has struggled in polling with voters of color. He needs to perform well in New Hampshire, but then the real test comes when the race moves to Nevada and South Carolina, which have much more diverse electorates. 3. Who finishes third? This might be the biggest and most important question of the night. Biden is fading fast. He has been hoping that South Carolina and his support with African American voters would be his firewall. (In fact, he's heading to South Carolina Tuesday night, instead of staying in New Hampshire.) But South Carolina is weeks away, and there may be evidence he's already declining with African Americans. A Quinnipiac poll out Monday showed former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who has now spent more than $350 million on ads, eating into Biden's support with black voters. Can Biden really survive a fifth-place showing in New Hampshire? Meanwhile, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who finished third in Iowa, needs to be able show she can beat Sanders and Buttigieg, the two candidates most eating into her support. She polls second with progressives to Sanders and second with college-educated whites to Buttigieg. New Hampshire is an opportunity for her to show she's right in the mix with them and deserves another shot when the electorate gets more diverse. But if she doesn't perform well .... ? 4. How far can Klobuchar go? She has seen a sharp spike since coming close to Biden in Iowa and after her strong debate performance in New Hampshire Friday. She's actually now polling third, slightly ahead of Warren and Biden. If she were to take third, wow. Moderates not thrilled how Biden has held up and think Buttigieg is too young and inexperienced are looking around. And Klobuchar has a good case to make. She's 59, been a productive senator, and won reelection by a lot in a Midwestern state Trump came close in. But is it too little, too late? She needs the donations to pour in if she's going to have a shot, and that starts with a surprising finish in New Hampshire \u2014 ahead of some of the field's heavyweights. 5. How long do lower-performing candidates continue on? Wealthy venture capitalist Tom Steyer has the personal resources to go as long as he wants, but he has seen little payoff in the results. He's making a serious push in South Carolina, but no polling so far indicates he can win the state. That effort might wind up wounding Biden more than any other candidate, as he's making inroads with black leaders and voters. Andrew Yang has a deep well of support, but it's not very wide. He wound up with fewer than 2,000 votes in Iowa out of 170,000. Yang is a serious person with a serious message, but if he finishes in single digits again in New Hampshire, he and his supporters have to ask themselves why he's running \u2014 is it to make a point or is it to win? And if it's to make a point, for how long, and will his supporters wholeheartedly get behind whoever winds up becoming the Democratic nominee?",
