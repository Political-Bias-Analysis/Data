The outcome of Tuesday's supreme court race could change abortion rights in the state. MILWAUKEE, Wis. \u2014 For about a dozen years, Republican lawmakers have set Wisconsin's policies on everything from voting laws, to gun rights, to union restrictions; for the last decade, conservatives on the state Supreme Court have protected those Republican priorities. That could all change as voters Tuesday decide one seat on Wisconsin's high court in the most expensive state supreme court race in United States history. Campaigning is expected to continue into Election Day, with spending tripling an old national record. It now tops an estimated $45 million, mostly from out-of-state sources. The amount spent is just one indicator of how much is riding on this single-seat election for both parties. \"I will tell you this. This is the most important election in this country in 2023,\" said former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder Saturday to get-out-the-vote volunteers in the Milwaukee suburb of Waukesha. The race is technically nonpartisan, but party support is clear. Milwaukee County Judge Janet Protasiewicz and former state Supreme Court Justice Daniel Kelly are vying for the one seat. A conservative justice is retiring this summer and if Protasiewicz wins, she would tilt the court's majority in liberals' favor.

After his remarks, Holder told a reporter at the Waukesha event that he doesn't know how Protasiewicz would rule from the bench on certain issues. \"I do know that she's a fair, competent, impartial judge,\" he said, \"and I can tell you how her opponent would vote on a particular case, especially when it comes to questions of voting and gerrymandering.\" If Protasiewicz wins, a legal challenge is expected to the state's current legislative and congressional district maps. State legislative maps have been drawn to benefit Republicans since 2011. Kelly, a private bar lawyer, defended Republican-drawn electoral maps in a 2012 case. He was later appointed to the Wisconsin Supreme Court by then-Gov. Scott Walker, a Republican, but lost a 2020 race to liberal candidate Jill Karofsky.

Some advocates for Protasiewicz say they also worry about conservative control of the court when it comes to setting voting rules for the 2024 presidential election in Wisconsin and if Republicans would challenge the 2024 results. Conservatives unsuccessfully fought the results of the 2020 race in the state, and there may be more lawsuits involving the 2024 race. Democrats also see an opening to overturn an 1849 state law that took effect last summer after the Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court. A lawsuit filed by Democrats last year challenging the old law will be argued at the circuit court level in May and could go to the state court within months. \"As a woman, I think the 1849 abortion ban is absolutely ridiculous,\" said Alicia Halvensleben at the Waukesha event with Holder for Protasiewicz. \"I'm really concerned about what's going to happen if this comes before our court and we have Dan Kelly on the court.\" Protasiewicz has been sick and off the campaign trail for the past few days, according to her aides. Kelly's campaign says he's made more than 20 stops over the last four days, including Sunday afternoon at Milwaukee County Republican headquarters in West Allis. \"You're the bosses, and we're the servants,'' Kelly began, \"the first thing I learned a long, long time ago, is that servants don't tell the bosses what to do.\" Kelly maintained he would be impartial on cases, and only wants to serve taxpayers. Local Lutheran pastor Dennis Hipenbecker was in the audience. He said he sees Kelly as \"very moral, from what I know, though we don't know everything about a person.\" Hipenbecker said he believes Kelly would rule against expanding abortion rights in the state, something he said is vital. One reason for all the late campaigning is that hundreds of thousands of people who vote in presidential elections in Wisconsin don't bother with supreme court races. State Republican Party Chair Brian Schimming told the West Allis crowd to reach out to 10 people they know and convince them to vote. \"If you hunt with them, if you're in church with them, if they're relatives \u2013 whoever those people are \u2013 we've got to get to those people,\" he said.

TALLAHASSEE, Fla. \u2014 The Republican-dominated Florida Legislature on Thursday approved a ban on abortions after six weeks of pregnancy, a proposal signed into law later in the day by GOP Gov. Ron DeSantis as he prepares for an expected presidential run. The ban gives DeSantis a key political victory among Republican primary voters as he prepares to launch a presidential candidacy built on his national brand as a conservative standard bearer. The governor's office said in a statement late Thursday that he had signed the legislation. The six-week ban will take effect only if the state's current 15-week ban is upheld in an ongoing legal challenge that is before the state Supreme Court, which is controlled by conservatives. The policy would have wider implications for abortion access throughout the South in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court's decision last year overturning Roe v. Wade and leaving decisions about abortion access to states. Alabama, Louisiana and Mississippi have banned abortion at all stages of pregnancy, while Georgia forbids the procedure after cardiac activity can be detected, which is around six weeks. \"We have the opportunity to lead the national debate about the importance of protecting life and giving every child the opportunity to be born and find his or her purpose,\" said Republican Rep. Jenna Persons-Mulicka, who carried the bill in the House. Democrats and abortion-rights groups have criticized Florida's proposal as extreme. \"This ban would prevent four million Florida women of reproductive age from accessing abortion care after six weeks \u2014 before many women even know they're pregnant,\" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement issued after Thursday's vote. \"This ban would also impact the nearly 15 million women of reproductive age who live in abortion-banning states throughout the South, many of whom have previously relied on travel to Florida as an option to access care.\" The law contains some exceptions, including to save the woman's life. Abortions for pregnancies involving rape or incest would be allowed until 15 weeks of pregnancy, provided a woman has documentation such as a restraining order or police report. DeSantis has called the rape and incest provisions sensible. Drugs used in medication-induced abortions \u2014 which make up the majority of those provided nationally \u2014 could be dispensed only in person or by a physician under the Florida law. Separately, nationwide access to the abortion pill mifepristone is being challenged in court. \"I can't think of any bill that's going to provide more protections to more people who are more vulnerable than this piece of legislation,\" said Republican Rep. Mike Beltran, who said the bill's exceptions and six-week timeframe represented a compromise. Abortion bans are popular among some religious conservatives who are part of the GOP voting base, but the issue has motivated many others to vote for Democrats. Republicans in recent weeks and months have suffered defeats in elections centered on abortion access in states such as Kentucky, Michigan and Wisconsin. \"Have we learned nothing?\" House Democratic Minority Leader Fentrice Driskell said of recent elections in other states. \"Do we not listen to our constituents and to the people of Florida and what they are asking for?\" DeSantis, who often places himself on the front lines of culture war issues, had said he backs the six-week ban but had appeared uncharacteristically tepid on the bill. He has often said, \"We welcome pro-life legislation,\" when asked about the policy. DeSantis is expected to announce his presidential candidacy after the session ends in May, with his potential White House run in part buoyed by the conservative policies approved by the Republican supermajority in the Statehouse this year. Democrats, without power at any level of state government, had mostly turned to stall tactics and protests to oppose the bill, which easily passed both chambers on largely party-line votes. The Senate approved it last week, and the House did so Thursday. A Democratic senator and chairwoman of the Florida Democratic Party were arrested and charged with trespassing during a protest in Tallahassee against the six-week ban. In a last ditch move to delay the bill's passage in the House on Thursday, Democrats filed dozens of amendments to the proposal, all of which were rejected by Republicans. \"Women's health and their personal right to choose is being stolen,\" said Democratic Rep. Felicia Simone Robinson. \"So I ask: Is Florida truly a free state?\"",

            "article_content": "NPR's Mary Louise Kelly asks OB-GYN Kristin Lyerly what doctors and patients in Wisconsin have been dealing with before the Supreme Court election \u2014 and how it affects abortion in the region.  MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: To Wisconsin now, where Democrats are celebrating a victory - Judge Janet Protasiewicz winning the state's open Supreme Court seat and thus flipping control of the court to liberals for the first time in 15 years. That has implications for all kinds of things, including abortion. After the Dobbs decision last year in which the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, a Wisconsin law from 1849 went into effect. It makes performing an abortion a felony except to save the life of the pregnant person. And it has changed how medical professionals do their jobs. KRISTIN LYERLY: I don't feel comfortable practicing in Wisconsin, so I am practicing in Minnesota, which is why I'm driving right now. KELLY: That is Dr. Kristin Lyerly, an OB-GYN who lives in Green Bay. We caught her yesterday in her car on her very long commute home. LYERLY: When Dobbs happened, you know, I decided that the best thing, the safest thing for me and my family was for me to work two or three weeks a month in Minnesota. I'm coming home from a 10-day stint. KELLY: Well, she is now back in Wisconsin, so we have reached out again. Dr. Lyerly, welcome to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. LYERLY: Thank you so much for having me. KELLY: Tell me a little bit more what it's been like for you these last 10 months, working in reproductive health with laws being changed at the level of the U.S. Supreme Court, and then this Wisconsin law kicking in? LYERLY: It's been a nightmare. It's been a nightmare for me and my colleagues and my patients - really, for all of us. As soon as Dobbs happened and we reverted back to the 1849 criminal abortion ban, there was so much chaos and confusion and fear and misinformation. We didn't know what kinds of procedures and care we could provide. People didn't know what kind of care they could get. And although we've clarified much of that, there still is so much confusion that it continues to cause problems every single day. KELLY: When you say it has been a nightmare for your colleagues, what's that conversation like with doctors who may still be practicing in Wisconsin as OB-GYNs? LYERLY: Well, on one level, people who are seeing patients every single day are faced with additional complexities and barriers to care, things that they're having to do to make sure that they are in compliance with this law, if it truly is able to be enforced. On another level, they're thinking about, if this law continues to be on the books, can they continue to practice here? I've spoken with a number of colleagues who practice in underserved areas who love their jobs, and they love the people that they serve, but they wonder how long they can stay there. And to be honest, they have resignation letters ready for if they need to go. KELLY: What about for patients, your patients? Where are they going right now if they need abortion care? LYERLY: Most of them are going to Illinois because that is the closest state to where our population centers are in Madison and Milwaukee. Some are traveling to Minnesota. Some are traveling further away. But many are not receiving the care that they need because they can't overcome the barriers - the cost, transportation, additional child care - many of these people have kids at home - time away from work. Any barrier to care is causing problems for people to access fundamental reproductive health care. KELLY: When you heard the news this week that Judge Protasiewicz would soon become Justice Protasiewicz and the implications for abortion in your state, what went through your mind? LYERLY: I couldn't even allow myself to believe it for about 30 minutes until I checked on a number of different resources to make sure that it was true because this is what we had been hoping for. Doctors across the state, in rural areas and urban areas, neurologists, radiologists, pediatricians, every specialty - we've really come together to help people understand how much this is affecting the house of medicine. And all of this effort that we've been putting out has not only brought us together but, I think, has given us hope. But we've all been afraid to dream that this could really happen and that we could get - we could be headed in the right direction again. So that realization that this truly could put Wisconsin back on that path to being a healthy state again, where we can truly take care of our patients was overwhelming. To be honest with you, Mary Louise, I burst into tears. It was - wow, just wow. KELLY: And to circle back to your area of expertise, to medicine - I mean, I get why this is of extreme interest for an OB-GYN. Like, why - when you say neurologists care, that doctors across the state are in your corner. Why? LYERLY: It's so much more than just abortion care. I think that because abortion has been such a political issue, we tend to think of it as something that lives on this isolated island. But the truth is, abortion care is integrated into every part of women's health care, from miscarriage management to helping somebody achieve a pregnancy, someone who's been struggling with infertility, to managing a complicated pregnancy, contraception - I mean, really, all of those things. And especially when we're dealing with complicated pregnancies, we often have to send our patients to people like neurologists, cardiologists, pulmonologists, radiologists. So we're consulting with the entire house of medicine to help our highest-risk patients have the most successful pregnancy outcomes possible. And they, too, understand how the system is currently failing pregnant people at all levels. And not only that, but in a state where we are criminalizing care, where politicians are inserting themselves in the doctor-patient relationship and threatening felony charges, threatening to put doctors in jail for truly taking care of our patients, what's next? So it's our imperative to stand up and make sure that people understand that we went to medical school to take care of each other. And this is just a different way that we are taking care of the people of Wisconsin. KELLY: What will this mean to you if the law currently in effect in Wisconsin is overturned? Will you return to practicing medicine full time in Wisconsin? LYERLY: It is my dream to come back home and take care of my patients here in Wisconsin. I'm a sixth-generation Wisconsinite. My whole family lives here. My kids are here. My patients are here. There's nothing I want more than to come back here and start taking care of Wisconsinites again. KELLY: Doctor Kristin Lyerly, an OB-GYN in Green Bay, Wis. She is also with the Committee to Protect Health Care's Reproductive Freedom Task Force. And she's one of many voices we're hearing from as the national conversation on abortion continues. Dr. Lyerly, thanks. LYERLY: Thank you so much.

            "article_content": "It's the final day for voting in Wisconsin's record-spending state Supreme Court election. The winner could be the swing vote on issues like abortion, redistricting and election lawsuits.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Wisconsin voters decide today who they want to control the state Supreme Court. There are seven justices on that court. They vote on big cases the way the U.S. Supreme Court does. Like the U.S. Supreme Court, they are ideologically divided in Wisconsin. And the election of one seat today decides who gets to be the referee in one of the big presidential swing states. Wisconsin Public Radio's political reporter Shawn Johnson is covering this. Shawn, good morning. SHAWN JOHNSON, BYLINE: Hi, Steve. INSKEEP: So is this essentially a battle between Republicans and Democrats then? JOHNSON: So technically, no. These are officially nonpartisan seats, but they are very partisan. On the Democratic side, you have Milwaukee County Judge Protasiewicz. She's been very outspoken about her personal beliefs in this campaign. On the Republican side, you have former state Supreme Court Justice Dan Kelly. He has shared less about himself, says he wants to be a boring justice on the court. But his Republican resume is very long. INSKEEP: And we have three liberals, three conservatives and this one seat open in the middle. What are the big issues that this judge could be the swing vote on? JOHNSON: At the top of the list, I think, is abortion. When the U.S. Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade last year, Wisconsin's pre-Civil War abortion ban went back into effect. If Protasiewicz wins, the court could also hear a case on redistricting that challenges the state's Republican-drawn legislative and congressional maps. INSKEEP: Oh, yeah. JOHNSON: And, of course, whoever's in control of this court will hear lawsuits about the 2024 election when those are filed. INSKEEP: I think we're getting a picture of why this would be the most expensive state Supreme Court anywhere in the country on record. How much are we talking about at this point? JOHNSON: So the old record for a state Supreme Court race anywhere was $15 million. That was set in Illinois in 2004, according to the Brennan Center for Justice. Brennan says about 29 million has now been spent so far in Wisconsin's race on advertising. Another review of overall spending by the website WisPolitics pegs it at 45 million. So you're looking at two or three times the old record already. INSKEEP: Wow. JOHNSON: As far as candidate fundraising goes, Protasiewicz has far outpaced Kelly, with a big assist from the state Democratic Party. But in the closing days of the race, conservative money from outside groups has come in big for Kelly and closed that gap. And those conservative ads have almost all been on the issue of crime, attacking Protasiewicz for sentences she handed down as the Milwaukee County judge. INSKEEP: Shawn, I've heard a critique of judicial elections in the past, essentially that people never really know the candidates. Voters are not that engaged. And a very small group of people or a political faction can get their people in. Is that what's happening here? JOHNSON: I think it's safe to say at this point in the race that both sides now realize the importance of this campaign and what's at stake. Conservative activist Bob Dohnal organized a recent get-out-the-vote party for Kelly. He said that if Protasiewicz wins, the court could overturn everything from union laws to voting laws, to gun laws. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BOB DOHNAL: We know that this election is really, really key. There are so many things up for grabs that the courts can throw out. JOHNSON: And on the Democratic side, they view this court race as a chance to finally move Wisconsin's politics to the left. Protasiewicz supporters like Alexandria Delcourt are also highly motivated by the abortion issue. ALEXANDRIA DELCOURT: It's really important for me to have a candidate that is a champion for reproductive rights, reproductive freedom, just because there are so many places now where that's being stripped away so violently. JOHNSON: And you can't really overstate the importance of this race for Wisconsin. A Kelly win would preserve the court's conservative majority probably for another couple of years. A Protasiewicz win would give liberals a majority in the court for the first time in 15 years. INSKEEP: Shawn Johnson of Wisconsin Public Radio. Thanks so much. JOHNSON: Thanks, Steve.

MADISON, Wis. \u2014 An election on Tuesday could change the political trajectory of Wisconsin, a perennial swing state, by flipping the ideological balance of the state Supreme Court for the first time in 15 years. The race comes at a critical time for Wisconsin, with a challenge to the state's pre-Civil War abortion ban already working its way to the court and legal fights ahead of the next presidential election right around the corner. The stakes of the race go beyond a single issue. Should liberals win control of the court for the first time since 2008, they're almost certain to hear a challenge to Wisconsin's Republican-drawn redistricting maps, which have helped cement conservative priorities for more than a decade. Republicans are framing the race in terms of what they could lose, which they contend includes key pillars of former Republican Gov. Scott Walker's legacy. On a recent Saturday night in Madison, people lined up down the street outside the Barrymore Theater for a live recording of the show \"Pod Save America.\" The hosts \u2014 speechwriters who worked for former President Barack Obama \u2014 hold celebrity status in Madison, a Democratic stronghold that's proven critical to recent statewide victories in Wisconsin. This show is aimed at turning out the Democratic vote for Milwaukee County Judge Janet Protasiewicz in her race against former state Supreme Court Justice Dan Kelly, the Republican favorite. (Races for Supreme Court in Wisconsin are officially nonpartisan, but that's not how it works in practice.) At the front of the line before the doors opened, Ariel Hendrickson, a Madison resident, said the election boiled down to two issues. \"Abortion rights and making sure that gerrymandering does not get any worse in our state,\" Hendrickson said.

Abortion has been a major issue in Wisconsin since the U.S. Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade last summer, a ruling that reinstated a long-dormant abortion ban first written in 1849. Democrats have featured it prominently in their ads for statewide office over the past year, and it's been the bedrock of Protasiewicz's campaign. \"I know people keep saying this, but this is probably one of the most important elections for Wisconsin,\" said Sheila Hosseini, also of Madison. \"Especially because reproductive rights are on the line.\" In a state like Wisconsin where close elections are a way of life, voters are accustomed to hearing every couple of years \u2014 or in this case, every few months \u2014 that the latest campaign is the most important one yet. But there's actually so much riding on Wisconsin's court race this year, that it might fit that billing, says University of Wisconsin-Madison political science and law professor Howard Schweber. \"I have to agree, I think this election really does live up to its hype,\" Schweber says. \"In the sense that the stakes are extraordinarily high across an extraordinarily broad range of issues.\" Supporters of former Justice Dan Kelly attend a St. Patrick's Day party with Republican speakers on March 16 at Clifford's Supper Club in Hales Corners, Wis.\n                \n                    \n                    Angela Major/WPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Supporters of former Justice Dan Kelly attend a St. Patrick's Day party with Republican speakers on March 16 at Clifford's Supper Club in Hales Corners, Wis. Money has poured into the race, doubling, and by one estimate, tripling the old national record for spending in a state Supreme Court campaign. According to the Brennan Center for Justice, the old record of $15.2 million was set in a 2004 race for the Illinois Supreme Court. According to the center's tracking, nearly $29 million had been spent on political ads in Wisconsin's race. Another running tally by the Wisconsin political news site WisPolitics found total spending on the race had hit $45 million. \"It shows that Wisconsin just tends to be the center of the political universe,\" says Anthony Chergosky, a professor of political science at the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse. \"And it also shows that money is flowing into this high stakes battle over abortion in the post-Roe v. Wade political landscape.\" For Republican activists, the Supreme Court election is less about what they could gain and more about what they could lose. At a Republican get-out-the-vote party in the Milwaukee suburb of Hales Corners, organizers warned that a long list of GOP wins could get struck down if liberals win the court, including election laws like voter ID and laws that strengthen gun owner rights.

Former Gov. Walker's signature law curbing union rights could also be in danger if the court flips, according to Orville Seymer, a longtime Republican activist. Protasiewicz was among the tens of thousands who marched against the law in 2011. She also signed a recall petition against Walker. \"All those things, they don't appear on the ballot, but they really are on the ballot,\" Seymer said at the GOP event. \"People are voting on those issues. And the people here in this room \u2014 conservative people \u2014 they want to maintain that.\" While seemingly everyone else is framing the court race in terms of issues, Kelly has notably avoided them. \"If I were to start talking about my political views, that would be no more relevant to this race than who I think the Packers' next quarterback ought to be,\" he said at a Milwaukee Press Club forum in March. As a private lawyer, Kelly once defended Republicans' legislative maps in federal court, and his recent clients included state and national Republican parties. Kelly offered legal counsel to the state party after the 2020 presidential election when Republicans used fake electors in an effort to contest former President Donald Trump's narrow loss in Wisconsin. It's not that Kelly has never shared his views. About a decade ago, Kelly wrote in a blog that abortion took the life of a human being, and he wrote a passage in a book comparing affirmative action to slavery. As a judicial candidate, he says it's inappropriate for him to share his political views, since a judge's job is applying the law. \"I am running to be the most boring Supreme Court justice in the history of the country,\" Kelly said. \"Because the role of the court is not to be original. It's not to be innovative.\" Protasiewicz, who spent decades as a prosecutor and judge in Milwaukee County, has no such hesitation when it comes to sharing her personal beliefs, particularly on abortion. During a brief interview at the \"Pod Save America\" event, Protasiewicz was asked what kind of a difference she could make if she's elected to the court.

With a liberal majority on the court and new maps, their hope is that they could finally push the state's politics to the left like neighboring Minnesota and Michigan. That prospect has helped Protasiewicz smash candidate fundraising records, drawing from a network of Democratic donors around the country and a handful of wealthy donors, like George Soros and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, who've made million-dollar donations to the state Democratic Party. Conservatives were badly outspent in the early stages of the race but have closed the funding gap recently. The state's largest business lobby, Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce, and a group funded by GOP megadonor Richard Uihlein, have spent more than $10 million on ads attacking Protasiewicz as soft on crime. Both parties have also described this race in presidential terms because whichever side wins will have a majority on the court ahead of the 2024 presidential race. That means they'll get to hear election lawsuits in Wisconsin, the swing state where each campaign feels a little more important than the last.",

Marts Center on the campus of Wilkes University in Wilkes-Barre, Pa., on Aug. 30, 2022.\n                \n                    \n                    Evan Vucci/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption President Biden speaks at the Arnaud C. Marts Center on the campus of Wilkes University in Wilkes-Barre, Pa., on Aug. 30, 2022. When people have been asked about their biggest concern in politics, crime hasn't popped as the \"top\" priority in the past year. Shortly before the 2022 midterm elections, it was inflation for Republicans and abortion rights for Democrats that consistently ranked as the top issues. But that doesn't mean crime isn't seen as important and motivating in politics. It's partially why, in the year before a presidential election, the Biden White House is positioning the president to the middle on this issue and a host of other issues, including immigration and the priorities reflected in his budget proposal. The budget includes popular poll-tested items, like raising taxes on the wealthy to preserve Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security and capping costs for prescription drugs. On Thursday, the president's support helped the Senate block a Washington, D.C., crime bill that Republicans billed as too soft on crime, because, for example, it would lower the maximum prison sentences for carjackings. That's at a time when motor vehicle thefts in the district are up 109% from the previous year. The move split Democratic senators, but most \u2014 33 \u2014 voted with Republicans to block the bill, including the most vulnerable Democrats up for reelection in 2024. \"If we were to somehow send a message that, alright, we're going to lower the penalty on carjacking? That doesn't pass the smell test,\" Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., told NPR. (Warner is not up for reelection until 2026.) Democrats did better than expected last year, largely because of extreme, Trump-aligned candidates, who didn't fare well in swing states or competitive House districts. But Republicans still took control of the chamber, albeit with only a four-seat majority. \"I think there might be a Democratic House if folks had handled the crime issue differently,\" Warner said. Some 15% of all ads in 2022 mentioned crime, up from just 5% in 2020, according to the ad-tracking firm AdImpact. Nearly 1-in-5 ads funded by the National Republican Congressional Committee or the Congressional Leadership Fund focused on crime. (The NRCC is the committee that helps get Republicans elected to the House, and the Congressional Leadership Fund is the outside political action committee tied to House leadership.) Republicans use crime as a way to hammer Democratic governance in big cities, particularly as homicides, auto thefts and other crimes \u2014 while nowhere near mid-1990s levels \u2014 have increased in many places. While just 9% overall said crime should be a top priority of the new Congress in an NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll in December, the number was slightly higher with independents \u2014 13%. Asked a different way, the Pew Research Center also found that just before the midterms, 6 in 10 voters overall said violent crime was \"very important\" to their vote. There was a big partisan split with almost three-quarters of Republicans saying it was very important, but slightly less than half of Democrats saying the same. Almost 7 in 10 independent registered voters who lean Republican said crime was \"very important,\" according to the survey. Independents who leaned Democratic were about the same as Democrats overall in how they feel about crime. Rural voters overwhelmingly vote Republican and urban voters are largely very Democratic. That has meant that Democrats run most big cities across the country. Dramatic smash-and-grabs have grabbed media attention, and carjackings and homicides have become more prevalent, sometimes where those crimes typically don't take place. That can disrupt politics, particularly at the local level. Crime is typically a baseline factor in mayoral races. In other words, when a city feels safe, other things become more important as voting issues, but when people don't feel safe, it can be a dominant issue on voters' minds. Look at the Chicago mayor's race earlier this month. Mayor Lori Lightfoot became the first mayor ousted after one term there in 40 years \u2014 and crime was the major issue in the campaign. In New York, Mayor Eric Adams, a former police officer, won election in 2021, and with robberies on the rise, has suggested not allowing people to wear masks in stores. \"We are putting out a clear call to all of our shops, do not allow people to enter the store without taking off their face mask,\" Adam said in a radio interview this week. This is in a city that was very open to COVID restrictions. But New York saw nearly 4,000 more robberies in 2022 than 2021. It was the most in at least a decade. \"When you see these mask-wearing people, oftentimes it's not about being fearful of the pandemic,\" Adams said, \"it's fearful of the police catching them for their deeds.\" Former President Trump, who is running again and is at least a co-frontrunner for the nomination, decried \"American carnage\" in his 2017 inaugural address, and he's made clear he'll use crime again in hyperbolic ways as a way to attack Biden and Democrats. \"We need an all-out effort to defeat violent crime in America, and strongly defeat it, and be tough and be nasty and be mean if we have to,\" he said during a speech last year. \"Our country is now a cesspool of crime. We have blood, death and suffering on a scale once unthinkable because of the Democrat Party's effort to destroy and dismantle law enforcement all throughout America.\" Biden is certainly not part of a \"defund the police\" movement. In fact, at every turn, Biden has preached the opposite and tried to distance his party from the rhetoric. And this week, he tried to flip the script on Republicans. \"MAGA Republicans are calling for defunding the police department and defunding the FBI now,\" Biden said at an event before a union in Philadelphia. \"That's a good one. I like that.\" Democrats base that attack on the fact that Republicans stood against a $1.9 billion bill to increase funding for the Capitol Police and National Guard in light of the Jan. 6 attack. After the FBI search of Trump's home in Florida, at which they found boxes of classified documents, right-wing Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene tweeted: \"Defund the FBI.\" \"My budget invests in public safety,\" Biden said in Philadelphia. \"It includes funding for more training, more support for law enforcement at a time they are expected to play many roles.\" Biden has pressed House Speaker Kevin McCarthy to release a budget, something McCarthy has yet to do. \"Show me your budget,\" Biden said. \"I'll tell you what you value.\" He won independents in that election, but he's been struggling with the group. His approval rating with them was only 36% in the latest NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll. Biden clearly has work to do with persuadable voters on crime as well. An October NPR poll found Republicans had a 16-point advantage on which party people think would do a better job handling crime. Compare that to before the 2020 election when an NPR poll found that Biden had a 4-point edge over Trump on handling the issue. That included a 13-point advantage with independents. So perception has changed, and Biden is clearly positioning himself to get back in their good graces.",

Following the reversal of Roe, organizers changed the path of their symbolic march route. Instead of making their way to the Supreme Court, Friday the rally ends between the Supreme Court and the U.S. Capitol \u2013 sending a signal that there are still anti-abortion rights battles to be fought in Congress and in the courts. \"Boy, did we get a huge victory just a few months ago when Roe was overturned, but as you all know, that's only the end of the first phase of this battle,\" said Rep. Steve Scalise, the U.S. House Majority leader, to a screaming crowd Friday. The Republican from Louisiana has said abortion will be an important focus for House Republicans this year.

June's Supreme Court decision did little to sway the American public on the topic of abortion. According to an upcoming NPR/Ipsos poll, 60% of Americans say abortion should be legal in all (26%) or most (34%) cases. According to the same poll, many Americans see Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization as a politically motivated decision \u2013 66% say they feel that U.S. Supreme Court justices are guided more by their politics than an impartial reading of the law. Since June, several states \u2013 including California, Michigan and Vermont \u2013 have bolstered abortion protections. And in the 2022 elections, voters rejected a number of measures that would have restricted abortion access or criminalized doctors.

Two top European leaders are visiting China.  MICHEL MARTIN, HOST: Wisconsin voted for change last night. They elected a state Supreme Court justice, and it was no ordinary race. Janet Protasiewicz campaigned for abortion rights and against Republican gerrymandered election maps. She gives progressives on that court a majority to support one and overturn the other. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Chicago also voted for change. Having already unseated Mayor Lori Lightfoot, they voted for Brandon Johnson, who was the more progressive of two candidates, in a runoff. MARTIN: And also last night, a candidate for president gave a speech. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DONALD TRUMP: From the beginning, the Democrats spied on my campaign. Remember that? They attacked me with an onslaught of fraudulent investigations. INSKEEP: Donald Trump was just back from a courtroom where he pleaded not guilty to 34 felonies. Prosecutors accuse him of falsifying business records to cover up payments to an adult film star. MARTIN: Andrea Bernstein is with us now to tell us more. Andrea, good morning. ANDREA BERNSTEIN, BYLINE: Good morning. MARTIN: So on the one hand, this was an historic event; on the other hand, a very mundane thing that happens thousands of times every day. So what was it like to be there in that courtroom? BERNSTEIN: So I have been in that courtroom a lot, and yesterday was like no other day. Here was a former president of the United States kind of shuffling grimly into the room, flanked by court officers and Secret Service. This was a man of many words who uttered just five of them, and they were not guilty and answering yes to three procedural questions. And I know that we've talked about this hush money scheme and the payments to adult porn star Stormy Daniels so many times that we all kind of feel numb to it, but here was a former president charged with 34 felonies. He was charged with writing checks that reimburse the hush money, legal retainers, and that, according to the DA, that was to hide what the DA calls a conspiracy to undermine the 2016 election by using the hush money to alter the outcome of the campaign. And that's obviously the campaign that he won, the first one, to become president. So totally not normal. And yet here was Donald Trump once again making something unthinkable somehow something normal. MARTIN: So he was pretty terse in court, but typically loquacious on social media, right? He's personally attacked the judge and the DA. Did that come up in court? BERNSTEIN: Very, very much so. Just minutes into the hearing, the assistant district attorney, Chris Conroy, began talking about this and how Trump had, quote, \"directed a series of threatening public statements to the DA's office.\" And there was a whole discussion about whether this was OK, and the judge said, nope, he didn't agree. Trump's language was not justified, that all sides should refrain from making statements that are likely to incite violence or civil unrest. MARTIN: What about the subject of a gag order? Could the judge impose one? BERNSTEIN: Judge Merchan said specifically that he would not do that, especially because Trump is a candidate for president, with First Amendment rights. But there was a discussion of Trump not being able to talk about grand jury evidence that he'll get, not being able to post it on social media, not even being able to take documents out of the presence of his lawyers. That is a real loss of control for a man who's used to controlling everything. MARTIN: So what happens now? BERNSTEIN: So Trump will keep campaigning. He is the front-runner. And we are now talking about a trial, potentially, in early 2024, right around high primary season. And the case will be back in court in early December. MARTIN: That's Andrea Bernstein. Andrea, thanks so much. BERNSTEIN: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MARTIN: Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen is visiting the United States. She meets House Speaker Kevin McCarthy today in Los Angeles. INSKEEP: For those who don't follow this every day, let's recall the basics. Taiwan is a democracy that has held itself separate for decades from the communist government and has U.S. support. China regards Taiwan as a renegade province off its coast. Last year, then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan, and China responded with military exercises that surrounded the island. So how does China respond this time? MARTIN: NPR's Emily Feng is in Taipei, the capital of Taiwan, to tell us more about all of this. Emily, thanks so much for joining us. EMILY FENG, BYLINE: Hey. Good morning. MARTIN: Tell us more about Tsai's meeting with McCarthy and why it matters. FENG: Well, from Taiwan's perspective, it's a massive opportunity for Tsai Ing-wen to prove that Taiwan's closer partnership with the U.S. will protect it from China, which wants control over the island. Tsai's office also just disclosed today that she'd met with three U.S. senators quietly last week in New York to discuss potential American legislation that would sanction China if it ever invaded Taiwan. And so this time around, Taiwan's really seeking reassurance the U.S. remains a strong security partner for the island. Here's Dr. Lin Ying Yu, who studies international relations at Taiwan's Tamkang University. LIN YING YU: (Non-English language spoken). FENG: He's saying, although sometimes the U.S. meets with China, Tsai's meeting with McCarthy shows the U.S. will stick to its bottom lines and will not let China manipulate it on cross-strait issues regarding Taiwan.\" But for Tsai, in California today she's got a really tall order to fill. She has to balance these competing pressures of projecting defiance against Chinese interference, meeting with Taiwan's partners, but doing all of that without provoking conflict with China. MARTIN: So what else has China said about the visit beyond these veiled threats we just mentioned about more military exercises around Taiwan? FENG: Oh, they're furious, as usual. They've said multiple times last week they oppose the visit, that they're going to take countermeasures because, as Steve said, China believes Taiwan is its territory, so it opposes Taiwan having any kind of international meetings and behaving like its own country. This time around, China's already held these small-scale navy and air force drills over the weekend. We've seen an uptick in the number of Chinese ships and fighter jets that have been flying from China towards Taiwan. So there's a strong indication there's going to be military exercises as punishment for this meeting in the next couple of days. But the question is just how large these exercises will be. MARTIN: And what about in Taiwan? How is the meeting being perceived there? FENG: It's mostly positive because regardless of political affiliation here in Taiwan, people recognize the U.S. is by far Taiwan's most important security partner, even though the U.S. recognizes China, not Taiwan, as a country. So they want to maintain that partnership with the U.S. But Taiwan's a democracy. There are competing visions for how to handle relations with U.S. and China here. And so at the same time that Tsai Ing-wen has been jetting around the world and going to the U.S., her predecessor, the former president of Taiwan, Ma Ying-jeou, has actually been in China this week on a personal trip. That's where his parents are from, and he went and visited his ancestral family tomb this weekend. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MA YING-JEOU: (Non-English language spoken). FENG: That's the former president speaking. He's crying. He's actually trying to speak in a Chinese dialect. He claimed on this trip that people in Taiwan and China are all culturally Chinese, which is something that Beijing is really happy to hear, even though people in Taiwan might disagree with that statement. So this issue of how to manage China, either through defiance or through closer cultural exchanges or maybe a little bit of both, that's foremost in people's minds in Taiwan this week and as the island heads into its own campaign season now for an upcoming presidential election. MARTIN: That is NPR's Emily Feng. Emily, thank you so much. FENG: Thank you. MARTIN: It's not just Taiwan. The U.S. and China are disagreeing on pretty much everything at the moment. INSKEEP: Which makes things awkward for U.S. allies in Europe who also trade a lot with China. And this week, two top European leaders are visiting China. MARTIN: NPR's Rob Schmitz has been following things from Berlin and is with us now to tell us more. Good morning, Rob. ROB SCHMITZ, BYLINE: Morning, Michel. MARTIN: So, Rob, who's traveling to meet with Xi Jinping? And why now? SCHMITZ: Yeah, the two travelers are Ursula von der Leyen - she's the highest-ranking EU official - and French President Emmanuel Macron. And this comes at a crucial time for Europe. There's war in Ukraine. European countries have cut economic ties to Moscow and are increasingly dependent on the U.S. And now they're asking themselves, what do we do about China? The U.S. would prefer that Europe work on severing economic ties with China, but Europe's economy needs those ties, and that tension has bubbled to the surface for both of these leaders. Von der Leyen last week lashed out at China. She urged EU members to take a bolder approach towards Beijing. And Macron, a leader who has increasingly put himself in the role of EU ambassador, kind of like Germany's Angela Merkel used to do, seems very eager to play the role of diplomat with Xi Jinping. MARTIN: The war, of course, is very much on all of our minds. Chinese leader Xi Jinping just came back from a trip recently where he met with Putin. So how high is the war going to be on the agenda? SCHMITZ: Pretty high. I mean, they know that Xi Jinping is close to Putin and that China is becoming the main backer of Russia economically and thus is one of the only countries that has leverage over Putin. So von der Leyen in particular is going to try and push Xi to use that leverage to try and bring about a peaceful resolution to this war. I spoke with EU China affairs expert Francois Godement of the Institut Montaigne in Paris about this, and he thinks it's going to be difficult to budge Xi Jinping from his stance on Russia. FRANCOIS GODEMENT: I'm afraid that the European hopes are not very well founded. On the other hand, you can't be blamed for trying. And it's, you know, indicative that President Zelenskyy himself is relentlessly trying to move China from its position and to at least enter into a dialogue. MARTIN: OK, so you've told us what von der Leyen wants out of this trip. What about the French president, Macron? What does he want? SCHMITZ: Yeah, this is where we start to see differing set of priorities. Emmanuel Macron is traveling with an entourage of 50 French companies seeking to sign deals with China. You've got a big nuclear energy firm, Airbus, many others. Chinese state media is already reporting that a series of cooperation agreements in aerospace, nuclear power and agriculture will be signed. So this highlights Europe's big trade relationship with China and how this relationship is in some ways more important than ever, given the state of the economy in Europe. And with big protests over pension reform back home, Macron will want to return from China with some goods. MARTIN: OK, that's big - 50 French companies. That's a big entourage. Do you get the sense that these business considerations are overshadowing the trip's political goals? SCHMITZ: Yeah, and I think that's the concern of many observers. Washington is watching this trip with a lot of skepticism, as are many here in Europe. The foreign minister of Lithuania, a country that has difficult ties with both Russia and China, tweeted yesterday that China is only interested in helping China and that this trip will only increase Europe's dependence on a totalitarian state, a lesson that Europe has already learned through its trade with Russia. MARTIN: That is NPR's Berlin correspondent Rob Schmitz. Rob, thank you so much. SCHMITZ: Thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2023 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "For the first time in 15 years, voters have flipped the Wisconsin Supreme Court to liberal control. Justices are likely to overturn the state's abortion ban and could throw out GOP drawn voting maps.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Voters in Wisconsin have flipped control of the state Supreme Court. Liberals have an advantage for the first time in 15 years after an election yesterday. Now, in theory, this court is nonpartisan, but in practice, a conservative majority has given rulings for years, accompanied by opinions that sometimes read like Fox News commentaries. This time around, a progressive challenger, Judge Janet Protasiewicz, was open about pushing the court in a new direction. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JANET PROTASIEWICZ: Wisconsin voters have made their voices heard. They've chosen to reject partisan extremism in this state. (CHEERING) INSKEEP: She openly supported abortion rights and openly opposed election maps drawn by Republicans. She gives progressives a majority of the seven justices, just in time to rule on those issues. Chuck Quirmbach of WUWM is in Milwaukee. Chuck, good morning. CHUCK QUIRMBACH, BYLINE: Good morning. INSKEEP: Who is she? QUIRMBACH: Well, Janet Protasiewicz - Milwaukee born and raised, 25 years as an assistant district attorney, 10 years as a Milwaukee County judge. She's not been a high-profile jurist here, but she got into the race, you know, with that strong message supporting reproductive rights that maybe, apparently, appears to have helped her win. Now she is high profile, in an unusual scene for Wisconsin, anyway. The three current liberal state justices joined Protasiewicz on stage at her victory party, you know, the new incoming - the incoming new majority, so to speak. INSKEEP: Yeah. In an ideologically divided state, the seven-member Supreme Court becomes more like a legislature, and the legislative majority at the moment is on the liberal side, 4 to 3. How are Republicans and conservatives responding to this? QUIRMBACH: Well, maybe opponent Dan Kelly, Protasiewicz's opponent - Dan Kelly summed up feelings last night. He did not mince words. He went after Protasiewicz, saying she, quote, \"demeaned the judiciary.\" (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DAN KELLY: I wish that in a circumstance like this, I would be able to concede to a worthy opponent, but I do not have a worthy opponent to which I can concede. INSKEEP: Wow. QUIRMBACH: Yeah. To explain, Kelly has been complaining throughout the race that Protasiewicz should not be giving her personal views on matters like abortion and legislative redistricting, that it's wrong for a jurist to do so. The sharp tone of his comments last night continued sort of the tone he had taken towards her during their only debate a couple of weeks ago and, you know, what I heard him say at a campaign rally Sunday that was, by the way, at a Milwaukee-area Republican campaign headquarters. INSKEEP: Which shows the partisan leaning on that side, I suppose. We should note that judges races are not often that widely followed, but this one was. We reported earlier this week on MORNING EDITION about tens of millions of dollars spent, some of it from out of state. Did this affect the outcome in any way? QUIRMBACH: Well, it certainly helped keep the contest on voters' minds and, you know, reach out to the hundreds of thousands here who usually skip spring elections, though they vote in presidential races. I mean, you couldn't escape the ads. But, you know, I talked to voters in the Milwaukee suburb of Brookfield yesterday afternoon, traditionally a very conservative area, and Kelly still won it. But I heard a number of women say they voted for reproductive rights, including women who said they have previously been independents. Those lost votes for Kelly cut into his strength in the suburbs. Protasiewicz won big in Madison and in Milwaukee County, carried enough other counties to win Wisconsin by about 10%. INSKEEP: And of course, she's joining a court that may rule on reproductive rights, as well as on redistricting, where Republicans have given themselves a huge advantage in the Legislature in Wisconsin. Chuck, thanks so much. QUIRMBACH: Thank you. INSKEEP: That's Chuck Quirmbach of WUWM in Milwaukee. Copyright \u00a9 2023 NPR.  All rights reserved.

The April 4 election will determine majority control of the state Supreme Court. When Noah Turecek matched with Kristi Johnston on Hinge, he was immediately suspicious. From her bio, he could see that Johnston worked at NextGen America, which rang a bell. In 2020, during the presidential election, Turecek had heard about the progressive organization getting out the vote on dating apps. He remembered wondering with friends whether this meant the apps would become overrun with spam. When Noah Turecek swiped right on Kristi Johnston, he was already suspicious about her motives. Johnston is a young organizer with NextGen America and she's using dating apps to drive voters to the polls.\n                \n                    \n                    Hinge/Screenshot by WUWM\n                    \n                \nhide caption When Noah Turecek swiped right on Kristi Johnston, he was already suspicious about her motives. Johnston is a young organizer with NextGen America and she's using dating apps to drive voters to the polls. \"The first message of me reaching out was, was she here for a connection or is she here trying to get me to pledge my vote?\" Turecek said. \"Which one do you think?\" replied Johnston, the press secretary of NextGen and an avid Hinge dater. In the runup to Wisconsin's pivotal state Supreme Court election, Johnston helped orchestrate a mass-dating event to court young voters. Using Hinge \u2014 the only dating app that allows users to change their locations for free \u2014 Johnston and around 20 other volunteer daters swiped their way right across the Badger State. Johnston lives in the Bay Area, but expertly curated her profile to entice Wisconsin matches. In one photo, she dons a Cheesehead hat in a Beyonce-inspired pose. In another, she grins in a Green Bay Packers fleece. There was even a Packers pick-up line: \"What if I told you that Aaron Rodgers might leave you, but I never would?\" Kristi Johnston tried to make her profile appeal to Wisconsin natives. The California resident changed her location on the dating app Hinge to match with Wisconsin voters.\n                \n                    \n                    Hinge/Screenshot by WUWM\n                    \n                \nhide caption Kristi Johnston tried to make her profile appeal to Wisconsin natives. The California resident changed her location on the dating app Hinge to match with Wisconsin voters. Turecek, a 26-year-old data engineer, lives in Madison, Wis. That means he votes in a swing state soon to elect a justice to the state Supreme Court. It's the kind of race that doesn't typically register nationally. But this year is different. In the technically nonpartisan race, the stakes are high. With a conservative justice retiring, the winner will determine the ideological balance of the court: conservative or liberal. In the coming years, the court is expected to rule on Wisconsin's abortion ban, as well as voting laws and election maps in the battleground state. That's why traditional tactics aren't enough for traditional voter outreach groups. Many Americans are quick to send \"STOP\" to a campaign text or hang up on a phone-banker. But on dating apps, it's normal to talk to strangers and forge genuine connections. \"I appreciate how personal it actually is because they're treating me like a human,\" Turecek said. \"Not necessarily just a phone number or someone to call.\" William Blathras, a sophomore at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and chairman of Wisconsin College Republicans, is somewhat skeptical of the dating app approach. Still, he said it offers a lesson for conservatives. \"I think authentic connection really matters,\" said Blathras, who's majoring in political science and history. When it comes to engaging Gen Z, the 20-year-old said the Wisconsin Republican Party lags far behind Democrats. In last November's midterms, 70% of voters under 30 chose incumbent Democratic Gov. Tony Evers over Republican challenger Tim Michels. For this race, abortion access in Wisconsin is undeniably on the ballot. After the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last summer, the state's 1849 ban went back into effect, outlawing nearly all abortions. Now, a lawsuit seeking to repeal the ban is making its way through the courts. The case is expected to land before the state Supreme Court. Milwaukee County Judge Janet Protasiewicz has campaigned on her support for abortion rights. Former state Supreme Court Justice Daniel Kelly has criticized his opponent's messaging, saying it amounts to a pre-judgment of the case. Kelly, who is backed by anti-abortion conservatives, maintains he hasn't decided how he would rule on the ban. Blathras knows that his party's anti-abortion stance may be a dealbreaker for younger voters considering joining their ranks. But, going forward, he thinks focusing on other major issues for those voters can be a way to gain their support. \"A lot of conservatives now are more environmentally conservative,\" he said. \"Climate change is something that we can maybe find common ground on. And target that instead of taking the older approach of saying, 'it's not real.'\" Republicans do have a shot with Zoomers. In a recent poll, 30% of Gen Zers said they align with Democrats, while roughly a quarter said they identify as Republicans. Blathras said that's why the party should invest in young conservatives. It starts with bringing their online presence into the 21st century: He's seen some Wisconsin Republican profiles where \"the aesthetic, it's like, your mom's or your grandma's Facebook page.\" That's something Maddie Medved sees a lot. The 26-year-old is co-CEO of Girl and the Gov, a political media company for millennial and Gen Z women. When she consults with candidates and elected officials, it's all about reaching young voters on the right platform. In this election, for instance, TV ad-spending has toppled records. \"Our generation's not really \u2014 we're not paying for cable anymore,\" Medved said. \"We're paying for streaming services or we're watching TikToks all night.\" Sammy Kanter, Girl and the Gov's other co-CEO, said campaigns often write Gen Z off or fail to make their content accessible. \"The biggest misconception, especially of the older generations, is they think millennials and Gen Zers don't care. They really care,\" Kanter said. \"But if there's not an apparent way to fix problems, or to learn about how to fix them, that's a huge issue. That's the roadblock.\" She said North Carolina's Democratic Rep. Jeff Jackson gets an A+ for going to the right platform and sharing substantive information with young people. His TikTok account \u2014 which he started during his bid for office and now runs from the House \u2014 boasts 1.5 million followers. Explainers take the form of snappy, yet often serious, short-form videos. Medved wants to see more innovation \u2014 like the guerrilla dating strategy. \"A lot of campaigns, they have a text message send goal, but it's less about who got engaged, who pledged to vote, who took action from that text,\" she said. \"I think it's become a quantity over quality mindset in some of these organizing tactics.\" Johnston, the NextGen staffer and dater, said that's a balance her organization is navigating. \"At the end of the day, we do have a system designed around getting as many young people as we can registered to vote,\" she said. \"But I really don't think we should pass up on this opportunity to engage with young, passionate people who are at the forefront of deciding elections.\" Turecek said that before matching with Johnston, he was planning to vote anyway. But he'd fallen behind on the race's latest developments, and the interaction led him to do some research. Despite the motives of the match, Noah Turecek and Kristi Johnston hit it off and have made plans for virtual drinks \u2014 though it may have to wait until after the election.\n                \n                    \n                    Hinge/Screenshot by WUWM\n                    \n                \nhide caption \"Me getting more information came from just doing background, so that we could have more things to talk about,\" he said. \"It didn't hurt at all that she was pretty cute.\" Ultimately, the operation wasn't purely political. \"I would say I'm in love right now,\" Johnston said. \"I'm just so blown away by the niceness of Wisconsin boys. I'm in love with each and every one of them.\" She and Turecek are getting drinks on Zoom. And, she's cooking up plans with another match to go to a Packers game. She just needs to book a flight to Green Bay.",

            "article_content": "With the House finally seated after a week of drama, the legislative agenda is set to fulfill several GOP campaign promises to oppose abortion, investigate Democrats and target IRS funding.  A MART\u00cdNEZ, HOST: After a dramatic fight to elect Kevin McCarthy speaker, House Republicans pivoted this week to trying to make good on their campaign promises. The first pieces of legislation taken up in the new Congress are meant to send a message on what the majority's governing priorities will be. For the Republican-controlled House, that means cutting government funding, opposing abortion rights and investigating the federal investigators. NPR's Barbara Sprunt joins us now. So Republicans intend to launch a number of high-profile investigations, but this week they also voted along party lines to create a new subcommittee on the, quote, \"weaponization\" of the federal government. What's this panel supposed to do? BARBARA SPRUNT, BYLINE: Well, this falls under the House Judiciary. It has pretty broad jurisdiction. It will have the authority to investigate the government, including ongoing criminal investigations at the Justice Department. This has been a focus for incoming Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan, who has long been a vocal critic of the FBI. Speaker McCarthy has said it could even look into the handling of classified documents that were found at President Biden's Delaware residence and at his old think tank office. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KEVIN MCCARTHY: It could go from that committee or others, but I think Congress has to investigate this. SPRUNT: Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has called this committee extreme and noted that with Democrats in control of the Senate, not much of the House agenda will be getting through. MART\u00cdNEZ: All right, now, in the first new bill of the new Congress, Republicans voted this week to undermine a familiar political target for the party, and that's the Internal Revenue Service. SPRUNT: Exactly. And it would undo about $80 billion in new funding for the IRS that was passed into law over the summer as part of the Inflation Reduction Act. With that Democratic firewall in the Senate, this is a great example of a bill that plays great with the conservative base but is never going to be signed into law by President Biden. The money is intended to increase staffing at the agency, but Republicans have claimed falsely during the campaign season that it would create a, quote, \"army\" of IRS agents to go after Americans and small businesses. The Republican bill would add to the deficit, I think it's worth noting. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has estimated that without this new funding for more staff to improve tax collection, the deficit would actually grow by about 114 billion over the next decade. So it would cost more than the new funding. MART\u00cdNEZ: I know abortion also was an issue this week, and House Republicans passed two abortion-related measures. Barbara, is this surprising, considering that opposition to abortion rights is one of the reasons why Republicans didn't fare as well in the midterm elections? SPRUNT: Well, opposition to abortion rights is a pretty universally held view in the Republican Party at this point. It's another example of how they use this first week to not only make good on their campaign promises that they ran on in the midterms, but show voters that they're still talking about issues that they really care about. And just like the IRS bill, there's virtually zero chances that this moves on. But it shows that they're not shying away from issues that are important to the base. MART\u00cdNEZ: All right, so taxes, abortion, traditional partisan issues - is this what we should expect in Congress or any areas at all where there's bipartisanship maybe on the horizon? SPRUNT: There are. Members of both parties this week voted to establish a new select committee on China, investigating China's growing global influence. Republican Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin will chair that committee, and he's called on Democrats and Republicans to work together on this issue. MART\u00cdNEZ: All right. That's NPR's Barbara Sprunt.

            "article_content": "Access to abortion and gun control are issues that young people say are important to them but do these issues also drive young voters to the polls?  MILES PARKS, HOST: Lately, two issues have been in the news almost every day - abortion and guns. These are also two issues that are really important to young voters. But are they important enough to swing elections? NPR political reporter Elena Moore keeps a close eye on those young voters, and she joins us now. Hey, Elena. ELENA MOORE, BYLINE: Hi, Miles. PARKS: So let's start with the issue of abortion rights. This was a big part of Democratic messaging in a recent Wisconsin election for an open Supreme Court seat. Liberals did end up flipping the court. How big of a role did young voters play in that election? MOORE: So we don't have specific data yet like exit polling, but we do know that turnout was really, really high on college campuses. And we know that in those precincts there was high support for Janet Protasiewicz, who was the Democratic-backed candidate. And, you know, we can't extrapolate too much about this race. It's just one race. But we do know that abortion as an issue is a motivating factor for young people. You know, even back in November, during the midterm elections, voters under 30 - so Gen Z and younger millennials - actually said that their top issue when voting was abortion. And that's not the case for older generations. And that's all according to CIRCLE research at Tufts University. PARKS: On the Republican side, there are voices within the party who have long said that the party needs to bring their policies on abortion more in line with the majority U.S. opinion. The majority of Americans generally favor more access to abortion. Have Republicans talked about this issue differently to younger voters than to older voters, for instance? MOORE: I think they're working on that messaging. I talked to Scott Walker about this. He's the former governor of Wisconsin. Now he has an interesting role with young voters. He's the president of the Young America's Foundation, which is an organization that works to engage with young conservatives. And Walker told me on the issue of abortion, Republicans do need to work on their messaging. SCOTT WALKER: Conservatives overall have to do a better job of explaining not only the pro-life versus pro-choice position, but in particular, when it comes to candidates, staking out a reasonable position. MOORE: Reasonable position is kind of an interesting way to say it. He gave me an example. He said in Wisconsin when he was governor in 2015, he passed a law that would ban abortions after 20 weeks. PARKS: And what about the gun issue, Elena? How are young voters, and how are the parties messaging to those young voters about the gun issue? MOORE: I mean, it's also a really big issue. It directly affects young people. You know, guns are the leading cause of death among Americans under 19, and young people, voters under 30 - 3 in 5 think gun laws should be more strict. That's according to new data out of Harvard. And so I talked to Congressman Maxwell Frost about this. He's a Gen Z member of Congress, the first one. He has a bill addressing gun violence. And he told me it's obvious to both Republicans and Democrats that this is an issue young people care about. MAXWELL FROST: I think everybody understands it now. But I think that Republicans, specifically - they believe or at least they did believe that much like other generations - that Gen Z with time would become more and more conservative. And I think what they're seeing is Gen Z and young millennials are not becoming more conservative. They're actually kind of just sticking to what they believe in. MOORE: And traditionally, young voters do vote more liberal. And so that inevitably is going to affect issues like guns and abortion. But the key question for Democrats now is, does this actually get people politically organized, and does this get them to vote? And, you know, we saw that when we looked at Wisconsin, and we've seen that for years now with young people finding their political voice in response to gun violence. PARKS: OK. So it seems like Republicans have a little bit of work to do on these two issues. But how does that play into their overall messaging looking ahead at 2024? MOORE: I mean, it's on their mind. They're going to have to address these kinds of issues, but also they're going to try to remind young people about the issues that they think are really strong within their party, and a big one is on the economy. And we know that young voters do care about the economy. In the most recent NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll, it was the top issue for Gen Z and millennial voters. PARKS: That's NPR political reporter Elena Moore. Thank you so much, Elena. MOORE: Thanks, Miles. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) Copyright \u00a9 2023 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "The Biden administration is trying to reassure the public that classified materials are secure after a major leak of Pentagon documents. It is also fighting to keep an abortion drug accessible.  MILES PARKS, HOST: And we turn now to NPR senior Washington editor and correspondent, Ron Elving. Ron, good morning. RON ELVING, BYLINE: Good to be with you, Miles. PARKS: Thanks for being here. So let's start with that leak, again, allegedly by a 21-year-old member of the Massachusetts Air National Guard of highly sensitive documents revealing classified information about the role of the U.S. in the war in Ukraine. How is this leak playing out politically? ELVING: There's a lot of objection being heard from foreign capitals, of course. It's always embarrassing to have eavesdropping revealed. It makes everyone feel seen and heard and not in a good way. Back home, we have outliers, such as Marjorie Taylor Greene, congresswoman from Georgia, praising the alleged leaker for being an enemy of President Biden. And you have President Biden trying to play down the damage while former President Trump calls it the greatest embarrassment ever and then compares it to his own documents issue to dismiss the latter. Meanwhile, Pentagon officials, as you say, are trying to emphasize that there are processes in place to secure classified information. Now, here's Pentagon Press Secretary Pat Ryder - he's an Air Force brigadier general - fielding questions about the leak on Thursday. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PAT RYDER: Let me just emphasize my point, that this was a - you know, we have rules in place. Each of us signs a nondisclosure agreement, anybody that has a security clearance. And so all indications are, again, this is a criminal act, a willful violation of those and, again, another reason why we're continuing to investigate and support DOJ's investigation. ELVING: And, Miles, the young man in question here, Jack Teixeira, is accused of being the leaker and has been charged as a spy. Obviously, this is embarrassing. It's not the kind of spying we normally associate with that term. But putting this material on the internet is extraordinarily effective. The internet is a great leveler and force multiplier. And the United States might find it's going to be beneficial to Russian military planners. It could be divisive in terms of the NATO alliance and the coalition resisting Russia in Ukraine. So maybe the bottom-line question for the moment is this - if our government can't manage some degree of computer security in this area, what about other areas? Does this implicitly put us all at risk? PARKS: I want to get your thoughts, Ron, on abortion as well 'cause the Supreme Court has stepped in and paused restrictions on the medical abortion drug mifepristone, at least temporarily, while it looks at a lower court ruling that would have dramatically curbed access to the drug. Now, the Supreme Court's ruling last year, the Dodd (ph) decision seemed to play a big role in last year's elections. What do you think this mifepristone fight and then also all the other developments we've seen around abortion - what kind of role is that going to play in 2024? ELVING: It's always tricky to predict who is going to be galvanized or mobilized on an issue this volatile 18 months in advance of an election. But the big question in the meantime will be, what are the other court decisions? What do the courts do between now and then, most especially the U.S. Supreme Court? But right at the moment, based on what we've seen over the past year, it's a question of whether it'll be bad for Republicans or very bad for Republicans. This issue mobilizes younger voters, who otherwise would be less likely to vote. We saw that in Kansas and Kentucky last year. We saw just this month in Wisconsin, it also motivates women. And when women and young people turn out, Democrats tend to win especially in swing states. On the Republican side, though, in the primaries, we're likely to see a competition among candidates at all levels to see who can be most clearly and vociferously anti-abortion. And then, those Republican nominees will face a very different environment in their November elections. PARKS: Right. I was thinking exactly that when we saw the news out of Florida, where Governor DeSantis this week signed a six-week abortion ban, which, we should note, wouldn't go into effect until 30 days after the state Supreme Court rules on a challenge to the state's existing 15-week abortion ban. But what are your thoughts on that? ELVING: Ron DeSantis is all in on abortion restrictions, functional bans, in effect, because he knows this is not just a contest with Donald Trump for the nomination for president next year. It's all about winning the beating heart of the Republican Party. And right now, that is still the voters who turned to Trump in 2016. So DeSantis seems to believe that those voters are the present and future Republican Party. And while right now they're mostly still loyal to Trump, that could change, and the only candidate who's clearly capable of beating Trump is Trump. And if this frontrunner should stumble, this extraordinary frontrunner who's actually a former president, one way or another, DeSantis wants to make sure the lion's share of Trump's people come to him. He doesn't want to share them with other Republican hopefuls. PARKS: Moving on to Tennessee now, where two Black lawmakers expelled from the Republican-led state house after participating in a protest on gun control - they were reinstated. What did you make of the back-and-forth in Tennessee? ELVING: You know, we have to remember all these things were involved - gun issues, the murder of children, the stunning willingness, eagerness, in fact, among Republican legislators to oust these two young Black colleagues. Had they sanctioned or rebuked them in some other manner, it would not have gone this way. But instead, they put Tennessee in a bad light in front of the whole country. And there's a strong sense around these events that they've created a pair of new aces for the Democratic Party in Tennessee, and they are now instantly recognizable political figures. PARKS: NPR senior Washington editor and correspondent Ron Elving. Thanks, Ron. ELVING: Thank you, Miles. Copyright \u00a9 2023 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "Abortion is once again center stage in American politics, which is challenging Republicans on how to legislate and message around abortion rights.  LEILA FADEL, HOST: Abortion is once again center stage in American politics. Late last night, Florida's governor, Ron DeSantis, signed into law a bill that bans abortion after six weeks of pregnancy. In D.C., we're waiting to see whether the Supreme Court will take up a review of a circuit court ruling that the abortion pill, mifepristone, cannot be administered after the seventh week of pregnancy. Both leave Republicans facing a challenge about how to message and how to legislate on abortion rights. To help us break all this down, we have NPR congressional correspondent Claudia Grisales and NPR senior political editor and correspondent Domenico Montanaro with us. Thanks for being here again. DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Hey there. CLAUDIA GRISALES, BYLINE: Thanks for having us. FADEL: So, Claudia, I'm going to start with you. Republicans in Congress have the majority, but definitely not a super-comfortable majority. Some would argue that's because of the party's stance on abortion. So how are they messaging on the issue now? GRISALES: We're seeing a bit of a mixed bag when we hear from members talking about this issue. Some are focused on their base who want to see stiffer limits on abortion access while other more moderate members are speaking out. We're really seeing this divide play out in the House. And this includes South Carolina's Nancy Mace, one of those more moderate members, who on CNN said recently that this is a losing argument with voters. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) NANCY MACE: We are getting it wrong on this issue. We've got to show some compassion to women, especially women who've been raped. We've got to show compassion on the abortion issue because, by and large, the - most of Americans aren't with us on this issue. GRISALES: At the same time, many Republicans are not on the same page with Mace. So what we're seeing in many cases is that they're not all on the same page when it comes to Republicans, altogether, when it comes to how far they should go in terms of legislating to limit access to abortions. FADEL: Interesting. Domenico, is Mace right? I mean, Republicans have long campaigned on limiting abortion access. Now that it's a reality, where is public opinion on the issue? MONTANARO: Yeah. I mean, abortion politics and how people feel about it is very nuanced. But, you know, politics doesn't exactly lend itself to nuance very well. But, you know, most people are in favor of some restrictions on abortion. It just depends on how far people want to go. And that's kind of part of the problem for Republicans, is a lot of these state laws that they're pushing are outside of what the mainstream or the majority of people are in favor of. You know, a Public Religion Research Institute survey released earlier this year found that almost two-thirds of people believe that abortion should be legal in most or all circumstances. That's up 10 points since 2010. And the most signifying event here wasn't really the Dobbs ruling last year; it was the death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the Supreme Court justice, in 2020. FADEL: Now, Claudia, in NPR's reporting from the campaign trail last year after the overturning of Roe v. Wade, it seemed like Republican congressional candidates were reluctant to talk about their position on abortion. Do you think that's what we'll see in 2024? GRISALES: Yeah. So far, when we're seeing hints of how they'll approach their campaigns, I think we're seeing a repeat of that now. We will see, as we have in the past, that Republicans will talk about limiting access to abortion, but more and more in more general terms, publicly supporting the overturning of Roe v. Wade. But as for the next steps for legislating, that's less clear in terms of where they stand. We're seeing a lot of that being taken up by the states, by the courts. We did see House Republicans, for example, at the start of this congressional session, pass two anti-abortion bills, but they were mostly limited in scope and didn't go as far as taking up legislation that would have more broader impact. And so it's largely performative because Republicans know they don't have a chance in terms of moving these bills out of the House with a Democratic-controlled Senate, with a Democratic president. At the same time, we know Democrats are finding this to be an energizing issue for their voters, the vast - with the vast majority of the country supporting some kind of access to abortions. We did see that play out in the midterms with Republicans not performing as well as they had hoped. And so Republicans are in a difficult position here. And, you know, circling back to Mace's comments that we played earlier, she also talked about limiting access to the abortion drug and essentially said that we should ignore this federal judge's ruling on that. But as Domenico mentioned, Republicans who do represent voters who support these new limits will struggle, you know, in terms of finding agreement when we look at the polling and what they're up against. FADEL: Now, that's Congress. Domenico, this is, of course, going to be an issue in the presidential election, as it always is. And we mentioned earlier that DeSantis is making moves on abortion access in Florida, and he's a potential candidate. So what does that say about his possible campaign? MONTANARO: Yeah. I mean, they're basically - you know, when you look at all the Republicans, they're jockeying for the activist base. I mean, DeSantis himself had been criticized by activists on the right because he was supportive and signed a 15-week ban - and they thought that didn't go far enough - when, you know, there's a lot more public opinion on Republicans' side when it comes to 15-week bans. Although, there's a pretty sharp split. But when it comes to a six-week ban, far less so. FADEL: So that's DeSantis and what he's been doing, but what are other candidates or potential candidates saying? MONTANARO: Yeah. We saw South Carolina Senator Tim Scott, for example, form an exploratory committee this week, and he's known to be pretty conservative and religious. He said this week that he would actually find a - sign a federal 20-week ban, saying that he would definitely do that. And he was trying to criticize Democrats for being extreme on the subject. But, you know, when you look at most of what Democrats want to do or Republicans, very different and not - Republicans in their primary, not really aiming to the middle. FADEL: NPR's Domenico Montanaro and Claudia Grisales. Thank you so much. MONTANARO: You're welcome. GRISALES: Thank you much. Copyright \u00a9 2023 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "Recent events on abortion and the expulsion of Democratic lawmakers in Tennessee have raised the question of Republicans overreaching on particular issues.  ANDREW LIMBONG, HOST: U.S. politics has been roiled by a couple of recent events. In Tennessee, two Democratic lawmakers were expelled for protesting on behalf of gun reforms in the state Capitol. One of those lawmakers has already been sent back to the statehouse by local officials. And a federal judge in Texas has caused uncertainty by issuing a major ruling against approval of a drug that's long been used in medication abortions. NPR senior political editor and correspondent Domenico Montanaro says there could be potential consequences for Republicans here. He joins us now. Hey, Domenico. DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Hey there. LIMBONG: All right. So let's start with the latter of those two events, which would limit abortion access. What could this mean politically? MONTANARO: Well, this has really made a lot of Republicans who are interested in winning in swing states and districts uncomfortable. You know, there's a lot of gray, lots of nuance in how people feel about how far abortion restrictions should go. And since the Dobbs ruling that overturned Roe last year, the pro-abortion right side clearly has the political momentum. They've won special elections and ballot initiatives. It was certainly a contributing factor to Democrats' over-performance in the 2022 midterm elections. And we saw it again just last week with a Wisconsin Supreme Court election where a liberal judge easily won in a key presidential state. You know, few Republicans on Capitol Hill have said publicly that they're in favor of this Texas ruling. And on the campaign trail, it's only been former Vice President Mike Pence who's spoken up in favor of it. LIMBONG: This, like, near silence coming from Republicans, does it indicate that many know they have a serious problem on abortion? MONTANARO: Yeah. I mean, just today, a new Pew Research Center poll shows a majority are in favor of keeping medication abortion legal. Supporters outnumber those who want to make it illegal by more than 2 to 1. We're seeing some Republicans essentially saying, what are we doing here? It's bad policy and bad politics. South Carolina Congresswoman Nancy Mace, for example, says the FDA should ignore the Texas judge's ruling. Here she is on CNN. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"CNN THIS MORNING\") NANCY MACE: This is an issue that Republicans have been largely on the wrong side of. We have, over the last nine months, not shown compassion towards women. And this is one of those issues that I've tried to lead on as someone who's pro-life and just have some common sense. MONTANARO: What's amazing here is she basically has the same position as New York Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who's been calling for ignoring this ruling. And it's not often you see someone like Mace agree with AOC. It's really showing that the bind that the GOP is in politically is just really tough for them to get out of. Republicans in Washington can't control if very conservative states enact new hardline abortion restrictions, even if those policies are political losers nationally. LIMBONG: All right, onto Tennessee now. The expulsion of two Democrats in the GOP-led state, how does that all fit into this? MONTANARO: Well, it's just another example of what many are seeing as Republican overreach. In fact, one of those lawmakers, Justin Jones, has already been reinstated. Here he was after the Nashville Metropolitan Council voted unanimously to send him back to the legislature. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JUSTIN JONES: It just shows that our movement is bigger than one person, that it's thousands of people from across the nation and literally across the world who showed up today to stand in solidarity with the crime that happened here in Tennessee. And people are resisting. People are showing up. People are calling us to act. And the decision to expel us yesterday was not the final decision. MONTANARO: I mean, think about this - before these two Black lawmakers were expelled, it had only happened twice before since the 1800s, and it was for far more serious things - sexual misconduct and soliciting a bribe. Here, these lawmakers violated rules of decorum by protesting gun violence and speaking out when they weren't supposed to. The other lawmaker, Justin Pearson from Memphis, could also be reinstated as soon as tomorrow. Tennessee Republicans here really - we need to point out - inadvertently highlighted problematic narratives for Republicans nationally that don't appeal to the middle about how the party treats people of color and perceived inaction on gun violence. And these issues aren't going away any time soon. LIMBONG: Domenico Montanaro, thanks so much. MONTANARO: You're welcome. Copyright \u00a9 2023 NPR.  All rights reserved.

The future of access to abortion pills is uncertain after two federal judges issued a pair of conflicting rulings on Friday evening. A federal judge in Texas issued a ruling ordering the Food and Drug Administration to suspend its approval of the abortion pill mifepristone nationwide. A federal appeals court is expected to weigh in soon. Within hours of the ruling by U.S. District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, another federal judge ruled in a separate case in Washington state.  U.S. District Judge Thomas O. Rice ordered the FDA to preserve access to mifepristone in the case brought by Democratic attorneys general in 17 states and the District of Columbia. The impact of the ruling may become clear later this week. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minnesota) called a federal ruling that ordered the Food and Drug Administration to suspend its approval of mifepristone \"shocking.\" She talked to NPR's Leila Fadel. This conversation has been edited for length and clarity. On why Sen. Klobuchar found the ruling shocking What's shocking here is that one judge in Amarillo, Texas, should not be able to decide whether a woman in Montana or Wisconsin or every woman in the country can get the care they need. It's been on the market for more than 20 years after a four year approval process by the FDA, and it's used safely in over 60 countries.This is just another example of extremists trying to take away women's rights to make their own decisions about their health care. We think they should be able to make those decisions not. One judge in Amarillo, Texas, and certainly not politicians. But look, it's been clear that anti-abortion rights groups have been working to make abortion illegal for decades, which culminated in the overturning of Roe v Wade. They've been doing that work through the federal courts, which Senator Mitch McConnell helped to reshape with more conservative judges when he was majority leader. On what Democratic lawmakers can do to counter the move First you've got to fight it aggressively in the courts. There's a six year statute of limitations that covers when you can start appealing these things after they've been decided. This just hasn't been used in a way that he's used it before. Even his own lawyers challenging it noted that they hadn't seen anything like this before. On what would happen if the case ended up at the Supreme Court No one can predict. I just look at the facts here. I look at the fact that the American Medical Association, which isn't a radical group, they actually said immediately in a very strong statement, there is no evidence that people are harmed by having access to this safe and effective medication. We have got decades of proof to support that statement. There is a reason why judges don't usually enter these kinds of orders. Doctors and scientists make these decisions, not judges. On the Democratic strategy in Congress when it comes to access to abortion We just have put together that bill [The Women's Health Protection Act, which would codify abortion access]. After we did in the last Congress, the House under Democrats had voted for the bill before. So we'll keep pushing it. We also can push other votes on this, including the availability of this abortion drug. We have to be aggressive. But the people of this country have to be aggressive. Once again, we call on the people of this country to come out and say what they think, that this is an outrageous decision and that this judge in Amarillo, Texas, simply making decisions for the women of this country and it ultimately ends up in the election.

            "article_content": "NPR's Ayesha Rascoe speaks with Alicia Bannon of the Brennan Center, about potential reforms to selecting state judges following the $40 million Wisconsin Supreme Court election.  AYESHA RASCOE, HOST: As we mentioned, Wisconsin voters elected a pro-abortion rights judge to the state Supreme Court. The election also set a new record for most expensive state Supreme Court race, over $40 million by one estimate. And all that money has raised concerns about the independence of state courts. Alicia Bannon is director of the Judiciary Program at the Brennan Center for Justice. She's written about the problems with the current system and some possible solutions. Welcome to the program. ALICIA BANNON: Thank you. RASCOE: So what can this very expensive election in Wisconsin tell us about the state of judicial elections around the country? BANNON: Judicial elections used to be really sleepy affairs, and that is no longer the case. We've increasingly been seeing high-cost, very politicized judicial elections with a lot of money and a lot of special interest attention because state supreme courts are increasingly important venues for protecting key rights like abortion rights, also democracy issues. Partisan gerrymandering was very much on the ballot as well in Wisconsin. And so I think increasingly we are going to see more and more money pouring into these races, particularly in states like Wisconsin, where there may be an opportunity to shift the ideological direction of a court. RASCOE: I mean, how do other states handle selecting judges because they don't all run on elections, right? BANNON: So it varies across the country. Thirty-eight states use elections as part of their system for choosing their highest court judges. In 22 states - and this includes Wisconsin - judges stand in contested elections where you can have multiple candidates vying for a seat. Several other states, 16, use an appointment retention system where judges are initially appointed to the bench, but then they stand in up-or-down retention elections. And then in the remainder of the states, they're either appointments by the governor or, in two states, we have appointments by the state legislature. So there's quite a bit of variation. But elections are quite common, and the U.S. is quite unique in that front, and I think there is good reason for that. Judges aren't supposed to be politicians in robes. Judges are supposed to be deciding cases based on the law in front of them and the facts in front of them. RASCOE: What could be some possible solutions to those concerns? I know you've written about nominating commissions and argue that they're the best way to go on this, but what is a nominating commission, and how would that work? BANNON: So I'd highlight two reforms to think about in response to the world that we live in right now with these highly politicized, high-cost judicial races. One would be moving towards a publicly accountable appointment system and, as part of that, having a nominating commission that's independent of the governor that vets judicial candidates in the first instance and provides a short list to the governor. If you have a diverse commission and they operate transparently, that can be a really powerful way of limiting the influence of special interests and addressing some of the concerns about crony dynamics that otherwise can be a big concern in appointment systems. The other reform that I would lift up would be thinking about moving towards a lengthy single term for state Supreme Court justices rather than having them stand up for new elections or reappointment processes because in almost every state, judges have to stand for some kind of reselection process. And that is the moment where judicial independence is most at risk, when you have judges that are hearing cases, having to think about how their decisions are going to play out in the next judicial election. And there's a lot of evidence that that actually is the case, so judges sentence more harshly in election years. There's evidence that judges' behavior change. When they hit a mandatory retirement age and are no longer going to have a reselection moment, they suddenly start behaving a lot more independently. RASCOE: How do you avoid nominating commissions also being, like, swayed by politics? BANNON: In terms of how you can design a nominating commission to minimize those kinds of special interest influence, it's very important to think about exactly how you're designing that commission as well as how that commission operates. So you want to have commissions that are operating in public who's decision-making is done in a transparent way so that you don't have backroom negotiations. And it's very important how those commissioners get selected. RASCOE: The current system has, you know, benefits for political parties. Is there a movement where there actually could be reforms, and has something like this happened before? BANNON: So we haven't seen a lot of movement around judicial selection reform in the states in the past several decades. But if you look back in American history, we have seen these waves in the past. So judicial elections, for example - they didn't exist at all in the time of the founding. They came about in the later part of the 19th century as a judicial independence reform. People were concerned that judges were too closely tied to the political branches, and so judicial elections were seen as an accountability mechanism. Later, there was a wave where you saw a host of nonpartisan judicial elections take effect because there were concerns about the influence of political parties. And in the '50s, '60s and '70s, you had a move towards merit selection systems where you had the adoption in many states of nominating commission systems coupled with retention elections. And so we've seen that happen in the past, and I think we may be in a moment or coming to a moment where there could be another opportunity for such a wave. RASCOE: That's Alicia Bannon, director of the Judiciary Program at the Brennan Center for Justice. Thank you so much for joining us. BANNON: Thank you so much for having me.

            "article_content": "Developments on the abortion front this week seem to have a message for Republicans. But GOP officials do not show signs of softening their hard-line stance against the practice.  AYESHA RASCOE, HOST: It's been a big week for abortion news in the U.S. First, a candidate who favors abortion rights won a seat on the Wisconsin Supreme Court, Janet Protasiewicz. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JANET PROTASIEWICZ: Our state is taking a step forward to a better and brighter future where our rights and freedoms will be protected. RASCOE: And then two federal judges handed down contradictory rulings on the abortion drug mifepristone. NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson is here with us to sort it all out. Good morning, Mara. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Good morning, Ayesha. RASCOE: So let's take the court rulings first. They came on Friday evening. A Texas judge ordered the FDA essentially to take an abortion pill off the market. A judge in Washington told the agency to keep it available. So what are we supposed to make of all of this? LIASSON: I think we just have to wait for the Supreme Court to resolve this. Mifepristone is a common abortion pill. It's taken in the first 10 weeks of pregnancy. More than half of all abortions in the United States now are done using medication as opposed to surgery. And there's a two-drug combination - mifepristone is one of them - that's used for almost every single one of these medical abortions. And what's really interesting for abortion politics is that the plaintiffs in this suit, anti-abortion groups, are not saying that the regulation of mifepristone should be up to the states, which is what the Dobbs decision did when it overturned Roe. They're actually asking for what would be, in effect, a national ban on this drug. They are arguing that the FDA, 23 years ago, made the wrong decision when it said this drug was safe. And that's why this case has such potentially far-reaching implications because the Supreme Court is now going to have to decide whether a federal judge can reassess the judgment of a federal agency, in this case the FDA. RASCOE: Now, what about that election in Wisconsin? Because, you know, whether people agree with it or not, some states let people elect justices to their highest courts directly. Wisconsin is one of them. And Janet Protasiewicz was quite open about her support for abortion rights. LIASSON: That's right. Now the state Supreme Court in Wisconsin has a majority of liberal judges. What's really interesting to me politically is the Republican reaction to this loss. From The Wall Street Journal editorial page and many other voices are saying, Republicans, can't you read the handwriting on the wall? You keep restricting abortion laws, and voters keep rejecting you in red states like Kansas and now a battleground state like Wisconsin. Why don't you try to find some middle ground on abortion? The problem is that the anti-abortion forces won the legal battle when they overturned Roe, but they didn't win the political battle, the battle for public opinion. So Republicans in the Wisconsin legislature had the opportunity to find some middle ground, which could be something like Roe, keeping abortion mostly legal with restrictions, or mostly illegal with exceptions. But instead, they left an 1849 law on the books banning all abortions. That gave Janet Protasiewicz a huge target, and she hit it. She won by 11 points. RASCOE: So what are the lessons here for the GOP? Like, are other red states going to back off from their hard line on abortion restrictions? LIASSON: It doesn't look like that right now. Republicans who control most red state legislatures are moving forward with more restrictive abortion laws. Florida, for instance, has a 15-week ban. But now the Florida state legislature is about to pass a six-week ban. Six weeks is earlier than most women even know that they're pregnant. And Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who has his eye firmly fixed on the people who vote in Republican presidential primaries, intends to sign that law. RASCOE: So that's DeSantis. But what about the leading Republican presidential contender, Donald Trump? I mean, he has had concerns about Republicans' approach to abortions, right? LIASSON: That's right. And what's really interesting, back in January, he had pretty much the same perspective as The Wall Street Journal editorial page on abortion restrictions and what they would mean for Republican candidates. He blamed the Republican Party's poor showing in the 2022 elections on the fact that Roe was gone. And on Truth Social, which is his social media platform, he posted this tweet. He said, it was the abortion issue poorly handled by many Republicans, especially those that firmly insisted on no exceptions, even in the case of rape, incest or life of the mother, that lost large numbers of voters. And he went on to diss his own evangelical supporters by saying, quote, \"The people that pushed so hard for decades against abortion got their wish from the Supreme Court and just plain disappeared, not to be seen again.\" I would say some of those evangelical activists are saying, thank you, President Trump, for the 7-2 majority that overturned Roe. Now can we please move on without you? So that's just an example of how abortion politics are dividing the Republican Party.

            "article_content": "Liberals scored two victories in key Midwestern elections this week. We examine the races' political lessons.  SCOTT DETROW, HOST: Two of the biggest elections of the year took place this past week. Both were big wins for progressives, and both had national implications. In Wisconsin, an unabashedly liberal judge named Janet Protasiewicz won a seat on the state Supreme Court. That's after she explicitly campaigned for abortion rights and against Republican-gerrymandered maps. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JANET PROTASIEWICZ: I have been very, very forthright that my personal value is that women have a right to choose. DETROW: Meanwhile, in Chicago, a progressive named Brandon Johnson defeated a centrist Democrat to become the next city's mayor. What's it all mean going forward? NPR's Kelsey Snell has been following these races, and she joins me now. Hey, Kelsey. KELSEY SNELL, BYLINE: Hi there. DETROW: So let's start with Wisconsin with that win that gave liberals, Democrats, even though they - you know, it's technically a nonpartisan race... SNELL: Right. DETROW: ...Control over the state Supreme Court. What are the big takeaways? SNELL: I want to start with the fact that Janet Protasiewicz won this race by 11 points. And this is in a state that is not known for having big margins, particularly in a year that, you know, there's not a lot else on the ballot. This isn't a presidential year. Now, this tells us that abortion was a huge motivator for Democrats. And this issue is really not losing any salience for voters. Democrats have been, you know, not as motivated in voting for judicial issues in the past. And this is actually a kind of a turn for them. And if you talk to activists, they say they hope this is a start of a long-term shift for the party where they start to focus more on these judicial races to address some of the issues that they care about the most. Now, returning to that point about it being nonpartisan, another thing that was different about this was that she did run on politics. Often, we don't see that being part of a judicial race. It's supposed to be about the law and not about the politics. And, you know, this is another thing where we see a little bit of a shift and a possibility that this could be the way judicial races go from here. DETROW: And on one hand, it was kind of jarring to see that. But on the other hand, there are such key issues at stake. And it's so clear that this court would be deciding them that I guess it makes sense. SNELL: It does. And, you know, voters largely view the courts as being more and more political. This is kind of a change that has been happening over a long period of time. So it isn't surprising in that sense. DETROW: OK. So let's look at Chicago. This was an interesting mayoral election. This was a runoff after a contentious initial first round of voting. What happened? SNELL: Well, this is kind of a classic story of Democrats sorting out their internal differences. Brandon... DETROW: Very quietly and you know, everyone getting along, right? SNELL: Absolutely. DETROW: Chicago Democrats, that's always the theme. SNELL: Well, the story here is Brandon Johnson, who is a Black man in his 40s who was running a progressive message against Paul Vallas, who is a white man in his 60s who was running a campaign on law and order and business development. So you really see that split and different ways that Democrats can define themselves. And they really took different approaches on crime specifically. Vallas called for more police, and Johnson talked about a public safety approach and broader societal issues, with a focus on education and health care and housing. DETROW: Looking ahead to an almost certain re-election bid, we have seen President Joe Biden lean into the centrist aspects of his record, and we have particularly seen him try to take a more tough-on-crime approach than a lot of progressive Democrats like to see. Biden has clearly been trying to insulate himself from Republican attacks on Democrats being soft on crime. So do you have any thoughts on what these results mean for Joe Biden? SNELL: Well, Joe Biden has also been trying to insulate himself against attacks from Republicans on a lot of fronts. He negotiated with more centrist Democrats like Joe Manchin, and he worked with Republicans on big things like infrastructure. So Biden does have this record of having kind of a more centrist approach to governing. But, you know, a lot of progressives say that they have effectively moved the base of the party to the left over time and that, you know, when they run in a general election and as they move forward, those conversations will also move to the left. DETROW: So if the party is split on some of those key issues but, at the same time, looking at those Wisconsin results, sees abortion, which is an issue that most Democratic voters generally agree on - they see that that is a winning issue that is winning a lot of moderate and independent voters, is that what we can expect to see a focus on as a unifying and energizing message? SNELL: Yeah. I - as I talk to Democrats, I hear them talking about abortion, and I hear them talking about commonsense approaches to gun control. I think those are two messages that they see as winning opportunities. They also seem to really be focusing on the idea that they are the party of common sense in general and that Republicans are - in the term that they like to use - are the party of extreme MAGA - so tying some of these social issues where Democrats have an advantage in the polls to former President Trump and his liabilities and personal issues that also poll really poorly. DETROW: That's NPR's Kelsey Snell. Kelsey, thanks for coming by. SNELL: Always glad to be here. Copyright \u00a9 2023 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "The Wisconsin Supreme Court could soon vote to legalize abortion and end gerrymandering now that Janet Protasiewicz, backed by Democrats, has defeated GOP-backed Dan Kelly for a seat on the bench.  MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: An absolutely record-breaking fight for a single seat on a state supreme court is over. For the first time in 15 years, liberals will have a majority on Wisconsin's highest court come August. That is when the newly elected justice, Janet Protasiewicz, will take the bench. Well, to break this down is Shawn Johnson, political reporter for Wisconsin Public Radio. Hey, Shawn. SHAWN JOHNSON, BYLINE: Hi, Mary Louise. M L KELLY: Hey. So lay out the stakes for those of us not in Wisconsin. What does this liberal swing on the court mean for your state? JOHNSON: Well, I mean, you got a sense of it at the election night party for Janet Protasiewicz in Milwaukee, where the energy in the room was palpable. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JANET PROTASIEWICZ: And while there is still work to be done, tonight we celebrate this historic victory that has obviously reignited hope in so many of us. (CHEERING) JOHNSON: I mean, her supporters were dancing on the stage with her last night. To just get a sense of why it's a big deal for Democrats here that liberals now have a majority on the court, I think you have to look at the last time it happened. It was - 15 years ago was the last time they had a majority in the court. George W. Bush was still president at the time. So we tend to think about Wisconsin as this swing state, where control pings back and forth between the two parties. But on the court, for 15 years, there's been a constant in Wisconsin. It's been a conservative majority, and that is no longer the case. M L KELLY: Well, let's get into the issues because they are big ones that people tend to get fired up about - abortion, redistricting in the state. What is next on those, now that Protasiewicz is on the court... JOHNSON: I think now there's... M L KELLY: ...Or soon to be on the court? Yeah. JOHNSON: Yeah. She'll take office August 1, and I think you can be sure that there is going to be a challenge to the state's 1849 ban on abortion headed to the court. That ban took effect after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade here. So that case is already filed in a lower court right now. When it comes to redistricting, you know, Janet Protasiewicz, during the campaign, said that the Republican-drawn legislative maps here that have helped Republicans hold big majorities in our legislature and cement a conservative majority for, you know, more than a decade - she called those maps rigged. She said she'd like the court to take another look at them. And now that she's there, she's very likely going to get that chance. M L KELLY: How are Republicans reacting to that? JOHNSON: Well, the initial reaction last night from former State Supreme Court Justice Dan Kelly, who was Protasiewicz's opponent, was raw, to put it mildly. It was very critical of Protasiewicz, especially for a concession speech. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DAN KELLY: This was the most deeply deceitful, dishonorable, despicable campaign I have ever seen run for the courts. JOHNSON: At the same time, Republicans did score a significant victory yesterday - a special election in the state Senate that gave them a two-thirds majority in the Senate. And that could let them impeach and convict civil officers of the state - positions like governors, attorneys general and judges. M L KELLY: And briefly, Shawn, what do we know about who turned out to vote? JOHNSON: Well, we know that we broke turnout records here, with about 1.8 million people turning out to vote. That topped the old record of 1.5 million. When I talked to Marquette University pollster Charles Franklin, he said it was also a noteworthy day in terms of the size of the Protasiewicz victory, which was about 11 percentage points. CHARLES FRANKLIN: It's a substantial win in terms of percentages. It's an astonishing win in terms of turnout. JOHNSON: And you saw, with that turnout, the Democratic counties growing their share of the vote... M L KELLY: Right. JOHNSON: ...And you also saw Republican votes in the suburbs of Milwaukee sliding slowly to the left. M L KELLY: All right. Thank you, Shawn - Wisconsin Public Radio's Shawn Johnson.

Well, that result will give liberal justices a 4-3 majority on a court that is likely to hear challenges to a state abortion ban and to legislative district maps drawn by Republicans. The NPR Politics Podcast talked this through today. Here are correspondents Susan Davis, Kelsey Snell, and you'll hear first Tamara Keith. TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: There was money pouring in from way outside of the state of Wisconsin, and the candidate who was aligned with the Democratic Party and Democratic values said openly that she was pro-choice, that she supported abortion rights, that she would consider revisiting the state's congressional district lines and state district lines that have been highly controversial. That candidate, Janet Protasiewicz, won - and not by a little bit. She won by more than 10 points, defeating Daniel Kelly, who was more aligned with Republicans, campaigned at GOP headquarters and had connections to former President Trump's efforts to overturn the election results in 2020. SUSAN DAVIS, BYLINE: We need to just stick with abortion as an issue in this race, I think in particular, because it seemed to be such a central focus of the race. I read a fascinating data point that Protasiewicz spent a third of her ad dollars focusing on the issue of abortion. You know, in 2022, it resonated with voters in a way that I think some voters weren't even anticipating. It clearly remains an issue. I mean, Tam, are Democrats seeing this race as abortion is an issue that they should continue to campaign on and campaign on hard going into 2024? KEITH: Let me just tell you, as I was in Wisconsin right before the election, I went and interviewed voters. Now, admittedly, I was interviewing voters at a student union at the University of Wisconsin. So, you know... DAVIS: Reliably Democratic. KELSEY SNELL, BYLINE: Yeah. (LAUGHTER) KEITH: Reliably - yes, turnout was quite high in reliably Democratic parts of the state. That's how you win. And what I heard again and again and again was that abortion was a very important, motivating issue. And it was particularly motivating in this race because after the Dobbs decision, something called the 1849 law kicked in, which is a ban on abortion in the state, and that is inevitably going to come before the state Supreme Court. DAVIS: And it effectively outlaws abortion in the state right now. KEITH: Yes. And that means that abortion is an incredibly live issue in the state of Wisconsin. And the reality is it's an incredibly live issue in many states in the United States. And even if people say their top issue is the economy or they're not happy about the economy, they're not happy about this or that, the thing that they, it seems, care about most if they support abortion rights, the thing that makes them go to the polls is abortion. Sue, I want to ask you, last fall, there was also a Senate race. It pitted a more progressive Democrat named Mandela Barnes against the incumbent, Ron Johnson, who's a very conservative Republican. And Ron Johnson won. He won by about one point. It was a close race, but he won. And now not even a full year later, you have, Janet Protasiewicz winning by more than 10 points. So what gives? DAVIS: I think, structurally, there's a couple of things. It's always harder to beat an incumbent than it is to win an open-seat race, which is what Tuesday's race was. I think in a state like Wisconsin, you know, there's always probably going to be a race element to some of these elections. Mandela Barnes was a Black man. He ran very hard to the left. And I think that that could have been a factor as well. So it's hard to say. One thing that I'm also curious about Wisconsin is it's got a lot of working-class voters, right? Like, this is a type of voter that had been in the Democratic Party for a long time, have increasingly been moving closer to the Donald Trump wing of the party, but also a group of voters that supports abortion rights, especially blue-collar women. And if you're talking about a swing voter on an issue, there's a lot of blue-collar women who do not want abortion bans. And in a state like Wisconsin, that could be a really potent political force. And I think that's something we're probably going to hear a lot more about going into 2024. Tam, I also wonder if you think that you see this race as possibly a new front in sort of the war of judicial elections. The Democratic Party hadn't really focused on judicial races with the same level of intensity that Republicans had, certainly in the pre-Dobbs era. And it seems like we might be entering a new chapter here for the Democratic Party. KEITH: Now, not every state has judicial races. Many justices in many states are appointed, but there are states with elected judges, and Wisconsin is one of them. And in the past, candidates that were aligned with Democrats for judicial positions in the state of Wisconsin didn't really, like, shout that from the rooftops. They - you know, they just ran as like, I'm going to be a carefully considered judge. And then something changed. SNELL: Well, not just in Wisconsin. That's generally how judicial races have gone. KEITH: In this case, it's very clear that the veil was off. Like, everybody knew exactly where Janet Protasiewicz stood when they went to vote for her. And in a way, that means people are able to make more informed decisions. But also it does sort of change, I think, the way people view the judiciary, though the fact is from the Supreme Court on down, I think the way people view the judiciary has changed a lot in the last 20 to 25 years.

MILWAUKEE, Wis. \u2014 Democrats have scored a major off-year election victory in Wisconsin, winning the state's open supreme court seat and flipping control of the court to liberals for the first time in 15 years. Milwaukee County Judge Janet Protasiewicz won the hotly contested race for the Wisconsin Supreme Court, according to a race call by The Associated Press, defeating former state Supreme Court Justice Dan Kelly. Spending in the campaign shattered the previous national record for a state supreme court election. The win by Protasiewicz comes at a pivotal time for the court, and for the Democratic voters who carried her to office. Justices are all but certain to hear a challenge to Wisconsin's pre-Civil War abortion ban, and with a liberal majority, they're likely to consider a lawsuit that could overturn Wisconsin's Republican-drawn legislative maps. Barring the unexpected, the victory also assures that liberals will hold a majority on the court ahead of next year's presidential election, when Wisconsin \u2014 the perennial swing state \u2014 is expected to again be pivotal in the race for the White House. If election lawsuits are filed in state court, Protasiewicz will be one of the seven justices who have the final say. As Protasiewicz approached the stage for her victory speech, the crowd at the Saint Kate hotel in downtown Milwaukee erupted, while some of her closest supporters danced on stage. Toward the end of her speech, Protasiewicz was joined onstage by the three liberal justices she'll soon join on the Wisconsin Supreme Court. \"Our state is taking a step forward to a better and brighter future where our rights and freedoms will be protected,\" Protasiewicz said. \"And while there is still work to be done, tonight we celebrate this historic victory that has obviously reignited hope in so many of us. Should the court redraw the maps and give Democrats a better chance of winning races for the legislature, they hope they could finally push the state's political trajectory to the left. The court could also potentially redraw Wisconsin's congressional map, where Republicans currently hold six out of eight U.S House seats in an otherwise 50-50 state. Protasiewicz was born and raised on Milwaukee's south side, spending 25 years as a prosecutor in the Milwaukee County District Attorney's office and most of the last decade as a judge. While she never promised to rule one way or another on cases that come before the Supreme Court, Protasiewicz was especially open about her politics during the campaign. On the issue of abortion, she said she believed women have a right to choose. When it came to redistricting, she called the state's Republican-drawn legislative maps \"rigged.\" Attendee Jenna Proudfit shouts to alert the room that the Wisconsin Supreme Court race had been called for Judge Janet Protasiewicz on Tuesday, April 4, 2023, in Milwaukee, Wis.\n                \n                    \n                    Angela Major/WPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Attendee Jenna Proudfit shouts to alert the room that the Wisconsin Supreme Court race had been called for Judge Janet Protasiewicz on Tuesday, April 4, 2023, in Milwaukee, Wis. Her campaign also relied more than any in history on the Democratic Party of Wisconsin's financial support, so much so that Protasiewicz vowed to recuse herself from cases involving the state party once she takes office. In his concession speech to supporters in Green Lake, Wis., Kelly had sharp words for Protasiewicz, saying she had \"demeaned the judiciary\" with her campaign. \"I respect the decision that the people of Wisconsin have made,\" Kelly said. \"But I think this does not end well.\" Throughout the campaign, Kelly downplayed his political views, but he brought a long Republican resume to the race. He was originally appointed to the court by former Republican Gov. Scott Walker in 2016. Most of Kelly's career was spent as an attorney. In 2012, he defended Wisconsin's Republican-drawn legislative maps in federal court. In 2020, after Kelly lost his first election, he returned to private practice, where his clients included both the state and national Republican parties. Kelly's biggest financial backers included Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce and a group called Fair Courts America, which is funded by GOP megadonor Richard Uihlein. Together, they spent more than $10 million on ads criticizing sentences handed down by Protasiewicz as a judge in Milwaukee County. While money from Kelly and conservative groups came in heavy during the closing weeks of the campaign, Protasiewicz was able to counter with a fundraising haul that was previously unheard of in a judicial race, raising more than $14 million this year. The bulk of that money came in transfers from the state Democratic Party. The race shattered the previous national record for spending in a state Supreme Court race. According to the Brennan Center for Justice, the old record of $15.2 million was set in a 2004 race for the Illinois Supreme Court. According to the center's tracking, nearly $29 million had been spent on political ads in Wisconsin's race. Another running tally by the Wisconsin political news site WisPolitics found total spending on the race had hit $45 million. Protasiewicz will take office on Aug. 1 for a term that runs until 2033. Barring the unexpected, the next chance conservatives have to flip the court back will be in 2025.",

The winner will determine the court's political sway and could change representation and abortion rights in the state.  MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: In Wisconsin, an election tomorrow could flip the ideological balance of the state's Supreme Court. And the newly elected justice is almost certain to decide a challenge to that state's abortion ban. As Wisconsin Public Radio's Shawn Johnson reports, there are people in both parties who say the race could also change the political trajectory of the state. SHAWN JOHNSON, BYLINE: During a recent Saturday night in Madison, people lined up down the street for an event aimed at turning out the Democratic vote. Races for Supreme Court in Wisconsin are officially nonpartisan, but that's not how it works in practice. This is a Democratic city, and the Democratic voters in this line are here to support Milwaukee County Judge Janet Protasiewicz. At the front of the line is Madison resident Ariel Hendrickson, who says the election boils down to two issues. ARIEL HENDRICKSON: Abortion rights and making sure that gerrymandering does not get any worse in our state. JOHNSON: Abortion has been a major issue here since the U.S. Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade last summer because it reinstated Wisconsin's pre-Civil War abortion ban. And gerrymandering of the state's legislative districts has helped Republicans win big majorities in the legislature, cementing a conservative agenda for more than a decade. Sheila Hosseini of Madison says people understand the stakes of the race, which could flip the court from a conservative to a liberal majority for the first time in 15 years. SHEILA HOSSEINI: I mean, I know people keep saying this, but this is probably one of the most important elections for Wisconsin, especially because reproductive rights are on the line. JOHNSON: In swing-state Wisconsin, election after election, people are used to hearing that this campaign is the most important. But University of Wisconsin-Madison political science and law professor Howard Schweber says there's actually so much riding on Wisconsin's court race that this time it might be true. HOWARD SCHWEBER: I have to agree. I think this election really does live up to its hype in the sense that the stakes are extraordinarily high across an extraordinarily broad range of issues. JOHNSON: Money has poured into the race, doubling - and, by one estimate, tripling - the old national record for spending in a state Supreme Court race. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED MUSICAL ARTIST: (Singing) You're all right. JOHNSON: At a Republican get-out-the-vote party in the Milwaukee suburb of Hales Corners, organizers warn a long list of GOP accomplishments could get struck down if liberals win the court, including voting laws and gun laws. Longtime conservative activist Orville Seymer says former Republican Governor Scott Walker's signature law curbing union rights could also be in danger. ORVILLE SEYMER: All those things - they don't appear on the ballot, but they really are on the ballot. People are voting on those issues. And the people here in this room, conservative people - they want to maintain that. JOHNSON: Their candidate is Dan Kelly, a former state Supreme Court justice who was originally appointed by Walker in 2016. Kelly lost his last election in 2020. As a private lawyer, Kelly once defended Republicans' legislative maps. His recent clients included the Republican National Committee. But while everyone else is talking about these issues, Kelly notably isn't. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DAN KELLY: If I were to start talking about my political views, that would be no more relevant to this race than who I think the Packers' next quarterback ought to be. JOHNSON: It's not that Kelly has never shared his views. About a decade ago, Kelly wrote in a blog that abortion took the life of a human being. He wrote a passage in a book comparing affirmative action to slavery. But Kelly says it's inappropriate for him to share his political views as a judicial candidate since a judge's job is applying the law. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KELLY: I am running to be the most boring Supreme Court justice in the history of the country 'cause the role of the court is not to be original. It's not to be innovative. JOHNSON: Protasiewicz has no such hesitation when it comes to sharing her personal beliefs, particularly on abortion. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JANET PROTASIEWICZ: So I'll tell you this. I have been very, very forthright that my personal value is that women have a right to choose. Reproductive decisions belong to the person, right? JOHNSON: And when it comes to talking about Wisconsin's Republican-drawn legislative districts, she says the maps are rigged. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PROTASIEWICZ: I would certainly welcome the opportunity to have a fresh look at our maps. JOHNSON: For Democrats, in this moment, the race means everything. With a liberal majority on the court and new maps, their hope is that they could finally push the state's politics to the left like neighboring Minnesota and Michigan. They also describe this race in presidential terms because whichever side wins will have a majority on the court for the 2024 presidential race. That means they'll handle election lawsuits in Wisconsin, the swing state where each campaign feels a little more important than the last. For NPR News, I'm Shawn Johnson in Madison.

Gretchen Whitmer signs a law to include the rights of LGBTQ people in Michigan's Civil Rights law on Thursday, March 16, 2023, in Lansing, Mich. LANSING, Mich. \u2014 In her State of the State address this year, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer had something no other Democratic governor has had since the early 1980s \u2013 a legislature willing to pass her agenda, even if with only a two-seat majority in both chambers. \"We spoke with a clear voice in November,\" Whitmer said. \"We want the ability to raise a family without breaking the bank, strong protections for our fundamental rights to vote and control our own bodies.\" And Democrats have wasted no time getting their top priorities to the governor's desk. Within the first two months of the many-months long legislative session, Democrats passed their centerpiece tax plan, a bill to repeal the state's defunct 1931 abortion ban and legislation to create civil rights protections for LGBTQ people. Some items, like the civil rights expansion, came with a few Republican votes while the abortion ban repeal fell closer to party lines. \"I am grateful that we are finally, finally addressing it and repealing this archaic and punitive law once and for all,\" said Democratic Rep. Laurie Pohutsky, who sponsored the abortion repeal. Pohutsky physically tore a page containing the old law from a book of Michigan statutes as she spoke. But it hasn't all been easy. Democratic leadership learned a tough lesson when votes over the big tax cut got messy. The plan started as two separate proposals to roll back taxes on pension income and increase the earned income tax credit, but funding for business incentives and other spending got roped in. When the House vote did come up, after hours of waiting, no one was allowed to speak. Republican anger was palpable as they shouted down leadership. This moxy comes after years of Democrats feeling powerless in the minority, often being gaveled down. Now, they're finding themselves using some of the same tactics they once criticized Republicans for. \"Voters exercised their power in terms of what they wanted us to do,\" said Democratic House Speaker Joe Tate. \"They want us to be effective and I think we've shown that.\" Now, Democrats are rushing to pass the last of their early goals before going on spring break. That means getting labor priorities, like repealing the state's 2012 right-to-work law and a requirement for construction contracts to pay prevailing wage to the governor. Also, a deadly mass shooting at Michigan State University pushed gun control bills up on the priority list. A large crowd attends a rally to demand action on gun safety at the Michigan State Capitol on March 15, 2023, in Lansing, Mich. The rally comes as gun safety bills are making their way through the Michigan legislature.\n                \n                    \n                    Chris duMond/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption A large crowd attends a rally to demand action on gun safety at the Michigan State Capitol on March 15, 2023, in Lansing, Mich. The rally comes as gun safety bills are making their way through the Michigan legislature. Meanwhile, Republicans are hoping that speed backfires. While their colleagues are selling the labor proposals as pro-worker, Republicans argue they're unpopular and expensive. \"This is the beginning of the Democrat overreach that's going to lead to their demise and the Republicans taking back the House,\" Republican House Minority Leader Matt Hall told reporters ahead of his chamber passing right-to-work repeal legislation. \"They shouldn't gulp, they should sip,\" says Associated Builders and Contractors of Michigan President and CEO Jimmy Greene who has been a longtime supporter of right-to-work. He says he understands why Democrats are moving so fast this time around but warns against them overplaying their hand. \"They should show that they're responsible with power. Right now, it looks like they're power hungry,\" Greene says. It's hard to tell how strong the Democratic majority truly is, Greene says. Arguably, Democrats won control of the legislature with the help of a massive turnout spurred on by an abortion rights ballot measure. Not to mention newly independently drawn voting districts that ended up competitive anyway. One factor in Democrats' favor, though \u2013 infighting within the state Republican Party. \"I think the Republican party is the best gift Democrats have. The idea that they're doing all this right now with [an] absolutely dysfunctional, inoperative, broke party apparatus?\" Greene says. \"Let's be honest. They're not afraid of Republicans. I wouldn't be.\" There could be a long road ahead. The legislature still has all year to meet. Colin Jackson is the capitol reporter at the Michigan Public Radio Network.",

Ron DeSantis, a Republican, is expected by many to announce his candidacy for president in the coming weeks or months. Speaking here at the Republican Jewish Coalition Annual Leadership Meeting in Las Vegas on Nov. 19, 2022. MIAMI \u2014 He hasn't yet entered the contest for the Republican presidential nomination, but even so, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is one of the leading candidates. In polls of possible nominees, he rivals and sometimes surpasses former President Donald Trump. DeSantis has just released a new book that highlights his pugnacious style and hardline stance on issues ranging from education to public health. It picks up from his first term as Florida governor when he became well-known nationally through his frequent appearances on Fox News. November's election was disappointing for Republicans in many states. But not in Florida, where Gov. DeSantis won reelection by nearly 20 points. At his victory celebration, supporters cheered as he pledged to continue his campaign against ideas, policies and laws he derides as \"woke.\" \"We fight the woke in the schools, he said. \"We fight the woke in the corporations. We will never, ever surrender to the woke mob. Florida is where woke goes to die!\" As governor, DeSantis has waded forcefully into the culture wars. In his first term, following national demonstrations around the police killing of George Floyd, he signed a law criminalizing even some peaceful protests. Later, his \"Stop Woke Act\" restricted what schools and businesses can say about race. A \"Parental Rights in Education Act,\" dubbed \"Don't Say Gay\" by opponents, limits how teachers discuss sexual orientation and gender identity. He's taken aim at programs promoting diversity, equity and inclusion in the schools. He's signed a law banning abortions after 15 weeks. And he pushed through new congressional maps that eliminated two African American voting districts. Many of these measures are now held up by legal challenges in the courts. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has become a popular Republican speaker across the nation. He spoke to police officers about protecting law and order on Feb. 20 in New York City.\n                \n                    \n                    Spencer Platt/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has become a popular Republican speaker across the nation. He spoke to police officers about protecting law and order on Feb. 20 in New York City. It's a different DeSantis than the one David Jolly got to know when both served as U.S. House members in Washington. Jolly, a former Republican congressman from the Tampa area, says DeSantis was part of the House Freedom Caucus, a group focused on cutting government spending. \"At the time,\" Jolly says, \"I described them as the shutdown caucus.\" DeSantis and other members used government shutdowns to push for policy changes and spending reductions, even moving unsuccessfully to depose John Boehner as House speaker. Jolly says the most impressive thing about DeSantis were the connections he made as a freshman congressman with some of the nation's top Republican donors. Jolly says, \"It's always been a question to me: how he did it. And I believe it was just the commitment to fundraising and the raw political hunger of moving beyond the House.\" DeSantis, a Yale- and Harvard-educated lawyer who served in the Navy, spent three terms in Congress before running for governor. His frequent appearances on Fox News drew the attention of President Trump who endorsed him. DeSantis embraced the endorsement and ran a now-famous ad narrated by his wife as he reads to his children from Trump's book, Art of the Deal. In 2018, he was narrowly elected governor, defeating Democrat Andrew Gillum by less than a half percentage point. Two years later, after Trump was defeated, DeSantis rarely mentioned the former president's name anymore and refused to join the chorus of supporters who falsely maintained the election was stolen. Jolly says DeSantis used Trump to build his name recognition but after being elected, he moved on. Jolly compares DeSantis to Hall of Fame hockey player Wayne Gretzky who famously said, \"I skate to where the puck is going.\" Jolly says of DeSantis, \"He saw it was going to be Donald Trump's party and he skated to Donald Trump very quickly.\" DeSantis' rise to national prominence got a boost with the arrival of the COVID pandemic. In the first months, he largely followed guidance from the Trump White House and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. He shut down Florida's beaches, bars and nightclubs. Schools were closed.

When the vaccine became available, he championed it in almost daily news conferences and in a live broadcast where a 94-year-old World War II veteran received his shot on Fox News. But shortly after that appearance, in February 2021, DeSantis' approach to COVID began to change. He'd already ordered all schools reopened for in-class instruction. He soon signed laws banning face mask and vaccine mandates by businesses and government. Republican Aaron Bean served in Florida's Senate under DeSantis and is now a member of Congress. He has nothing but praise for how the governor responded to the pandemic. \"He went against the grain,\" Bean says. \"You can't say Florida now without saying the 'Free State of Florida' because Governor DeSantis has led the way.\" With his hiring of a new surgeon general, Dr. Joseph Ladapo, DeSantis completed his transition from vaccine proponent to vaccine skeptic. He endorsed recommendations by Ladapo that healthy children under 18 not be vaccinated. Ladapo and DeSantis have also said men age 18 to 39 shouldn't receive the mRNA vaccine. Nationally recognized public health experts say that recommendation is wrong and based on a faulty analysis. Bill Hanage, an associate professor of epidemiology at Harvard's T.H. Chan School of Public Health, says DeSantis politicized the public health crisis. His policies, Hanage believes, led to an increase of deaths in Florida from COVID. \"If you compare it with California, New York, Massachusetts and the United Kingdom,\" Hanage says Florida is \"the only one to have more deaths since vaccines were available, than before. The only one of them.\" In analyzing data compiled by Johns Hopkins University, Hanage found that in Florida, 60% of the total deaths occurred after vaccines were available. In the other places, the number of deaths after vaccines became available are 40% of the total or less. DeSantis dismisses the criticism, saying Florida voters looked at his record on COVID in November and gave him a resounding vote of confidence. \"Not only did we win re-election,\" he boasts, \"we won with the highest percentage of the vote that any Republican Governor candidate has in the history of the state of Florida.\" That's true, if you leave out the Reconstruction era. As governor, DeSantis has extended his authority beyond state agencies and laws into local matters \u2014 exerting control over school boards, county health policies, even businesses that hold drag shows. To the delight of supporters, he's quick to attack any who challenge him, from the media to the state's largest employers. After Disney's CEO said he'd work to overturn a law, DeSantis signed a bill ending Disney World's self-governing status in Florida. With his efforts to control even local policies, he's left behind the commitment to limited government he once had as a member of the Freedom Caucus. Former Congressman David Jolly says, it's a lesson he took from Donald Trump. Jolly says, \"What Donald Trump brought to the party was to really crush that orthodoxy of small government and instead say the ends justify the means. And so, whatever it takes to achieve conservative results.\" It doesn't matter if it takes big government, Jolly says. To DeSantis, it doesn't even matter if courts have said it's unconstitutional. Last year, with an eye to federal law and Florida's constitution, lawmakers drew up new maps for the state's 28 Congressional districts. DeSantis didn't like the result and demanded lawmakers draw new maps that ended up eliminating two districts that favored Black voters. Democratic state Sen. Geraldine Thompson, an African American lawmaker from Orlando, says, \"I was completely dumbfounded, blind-sided.\" It was the first time anyone could recall a governor in Florida taking control of redistricting. Republican legislative leaders pushed through the governor's maps and they were immediately challenged in court as unconstitutional partisan gerrymanders. But the maps remained in place for November's election, and helped Florida Republicans pick up four additional seats in Congress. Thompson says DeSantis' motivation in targeting black voters is clear. \"I think he has an interest in making sure that only certain individuals vote. And that those people are people who are supportive of his agenda,\" she says. \"And then making it difficult for anyone who does not support his agenda, making it difficult for them to vote.\" DeSantis doesn't shy away from battles involving race. He's banned Critical Race Theory from the schools even though it's a subject not found in Kindergarten through 12th grade curricula. He also drew national headlines when his education commissioner said he'd prohibit the use of an AP African American studies course in Florida. Congressman Aaron Bean says those policies aren't intended to target groups, but instead stand up for conservative principles. Bean doesn't expect DeSantis to soften his hardline stance in a campaign for president. \"I believe that should he go to the next level, which I think he will,\" Bean says, \"he will push forward an America-first agenda, a common-sense agenda, a freedom agenda.\" There are lots of questions surrounding a DeSantis run for the presidency. Among them, how will he handle intense scrutiny from the media and attacks from other candidates, notably Donald Trump? DeSantis hasn't responded to repeated interview requests from NPR. Up to now, he's mostly avoided interviews with mainstream media, preferring instead friendly appearances on Fox News and other conservative outlets. David Jolly says, for DeSantis, there's a more fundamental question. His nearly 20-point win in Florida came in a midterm election in which most of the country turned away from the Republican Party and many of the conservative policies DeSantis has promoted. Jolly says, \"The test for Ron DeSantis will be, is he really that skilled and that good of an evangelist to convince the country to follow the direction he took Florida?\" DeSantis' supporters have a slogan, \"Make America Florida.\" Next year, voters across the country may get a chance to decide if that's something that they want.

DALLAS \u2013 Texas is at the center of an ongoing, nationwide struggle between state and local authorities. It's an escalating dispute over who has what power \u2014 and when. The newest battle centers on criminal district attorneys in Texas' big cities, who are mostly Democrats. Some of these chief prosecutors have told their communities they will use their inherent discretion and not zealously pursue criminal cases against women who seek abortions or families who obtain gender-affirming health care for their children. (Several later said they would make decisions on a case-by-case basis.) But declarations from prosecutors have led conservative lawmakers in Texas and elsewhere to propose legislation seeking to curb the power of DAs. \"There is an interesting philosophical debate about where power should rest in a state-local system,\" says Ann Bowman, a professor at Texas A&M's Bush School of Government. \"How much the state should have, how much local government should have.\" The clash has echoes in other state-local power struggles. In Mississippi, Republican state lawmakers have proposed installing state-appointed judges in the City of Jackson and giving the capitol police force citywide jurisdiction. Jackson is 83% percent Black and controlled by Democrats. Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, a Democrat, said county sheriffs \"won't be in their job\" if they don't enforce a new requirement that owners of semi-automatic rifles register them with the state. Florida Gov.

Ron DeSantis waits to speak during a press conference held at the Broward County Courthouse on Aug. 18, 2022 in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. And a county prosecutor in Florida was removed last year after Gov. Ron DeSantis accused him of not enforcing certain laws. Texas' governor does not have that power, although some legislative proposals would set a process for removal. That includes one from Texas Rep. David Cook, a Republican from the Fort Worth area. His bill would ban district attorneys from having a policy of not enforcing any particular offense. The bill would set financial penalties, too. \"As a district attorney, you have a job which entails looking at all the cases that are brought in and judging each case on a case-by-case basis,\" Cook says. \"And so, if you're making blanket statements and giving blanket immunity, then you're not doing your job.\" In Georgia, similar legislation is moving. There, the state would create a commission to oversee prosecutors and allow for discipline or removal if they refused to charge a particular crime. Several of the same progressive prosecutors in Texas who made statements after the Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization decision aren't doing interviews on the proposed bills. The state association of district and county attorneys told members the flood of prosecutor-related bills \"deserves your full attention.\" District Attorney Mark Gonzalez of Nueces County in South Texas, who is facing an unrelated effort to remove him from office, says the group's announcement to not pursue abortion cases may have been too hasty. \"The statement may have been the straw that perhaps broke the camel's back,\" says Gonzalez, a Democrat. \"I think it'd be smarter for us to move in silence, and I think that may have been something we didn't accomplish.\" Yet he sees the bills to curb local prosecutors as part of a larger backlash against a more progressive approach to law enforcement, one that seeks to reduce mass incarceration and prevent its damaging effects. \"We have a different approach to making some changes to it, which can impact people of color and lower economic status,\" Gonzalez says. \"I don't know why that's such a big deal.\" Not every local official gets blowback for bucking the state. A group of Texas sheriffs refused to enforce the governor's mask mandate early in the COVID-19 pandemic, yet there was no flurry of proposals to make them follow that law. Some experts say that's because sheriffs align more with the conservative leadership of the state. State Rep. Cook, however, said he's open to reining them in. \"I have not filed a bill in that regard, but I certainly would not rule it out,\" he says. For the moment, though, bills targeting county district attorneys are what's on offer. Gonzalez says he has no written policy about pursuing certain crimes but tells his office to simply \"do the right thing.\" He's not running for reelection and said he will be happy to watch from the sidelines should any new law get litigated in court.",

This past fall, when Lauren Miller of Dallas was 13-weeks pregnant with twins, she got horrible news. One of the twins had trisomy 18, a genetic abnormality that causes about 90% of fetuses to die before birth. The other twin was healthy. She learned from a genetic counselor that continuing to carry both fetuses could put the healthy one at risk. She saw a doctor who specializes in high risk pregnancies who told her: \"You can't do anything in Texas and I can't tell you anything further in Texas, but you need to get out of state.\" That's exactly what she did. Miller traveled to Colorado and, at 15-weeks pregnant, she had a \"selective reduction\" procedure to help ensure her pregnancy with her healthy twin could continue. When she returned to Dallas and continued her prenatal care, she found herself navigating silence around abortion. She wondered, if the ultrasound technician knew she'd traveled out of state for an abortion, could she get reported? \"You don't know where anybody stands, so it feels like we're all kind of talking in code,\" Miller says. What Miller did does not violate current abortion laws in Texas, legal experts say. But the fear among doctors and patients in the new legal landscape in Texas is extreme, to the point where \u2014 as Miller found \u2014 some doctors won't say the word \"abortion\" in the exam room. The first amendment of the constitution protects free speech, explains Elizabeth Sepper, professor of law at University of Texas at Austin. \"Physicians have independent speech rights, to speak to their patients openly,\" she says. \"Physicians should not be scared to say the 'a-word.'\" Nevertheless, that seems to be what's happening. Many doctors in Texas who treat pregnant patients are extremely scared, especially of language in one of the state's abortion bans that allows people to take civil action against anyone who \"aids or abets\" abortion. \"It's just absolutely crippling,\" says Lauren Miller's OB-GYN, who asked that NPR not use her name because she is not authorized by her employer to speak with the media. Many doctors are unwilling to speak publicly about this issue. A half dozen Texas OB-GYNs NPR contacted for this story didn't respond or declined to comment. The Texas abortion laws were designed to sow confusion and fear, and they're working. Dr. Eve Espey, chair of the OB-GYN department at the University of New Mexico \"People are scared to talk,\" says Dr. Andrea Palmer, an OB-GYN in Fort Worth. If a doctor acknowledges publicly that they counsel their patients on abortion, she adds, they might worry they would be set up by someone posing as a patient or family member looking to bait them into talking about abortion and then sue. There are, in fact, three laws against abortion in Texas, explains Sepper. \"We have the trigger ban that was recently enacted and comes along with up to life imprisonment for violation,\" she says. \"We have possibly the pre-Roe ban, which Texas officials are arguing is still in effect, and applies both to performance of an abortion and to providing the instrumentality or the means of an abortion. And then we have SB8 as a civil backstop, which prohibits aiding and abetting abortions.\" There is an exception in Texas law that allows abortion when a woman's life or a \"major bodily function\" is in imminent danger. But it's not uncommon for there to be pregnancy complications \u2014 like Lauren Miller's \u2014 where many doctors would consider it to be the standard of care to offer abortion as an option. Those are the kind of circumstances where physicians feel like they can't be fully truthful about a patient's options without risking a lawsuit. \"I have colleagues who say cryptic things like, 'The weather's really nice in New Mexico right now. You should go check it out.' Or, 'I've heard traveling to Colorado is really nice this time of year,' \" says Miller's OB-GYN. Patients have to be well-educated enough to pick up on these hints, do their own research, and figure out what to do next. They also have to have the means to travel or find funding to do so, if they want to pursue abortion. The doctor herself is careful not to put things in writing, and even having frank conversations with her patients about abortion options out-of-state \u2014 whether the conversations are in-person or over the phone \u2014 makes her feel vulnerable. \"I am putting myself out there,\" she says. \"If a patient's grandmother and or partner or sister finds out that I've talked to them about an abortion, and that's something that really, really upsets them, all they have to do is find a lawyer and all of a sudden I'm 'aiding and abetting' someone into an abortion.\" A 33-year-old mother of three from central Texas is escorted down the hall by a clinic administrator prior to getting an abortion, at Hope Medical Group for Women in Shreveport, La., in late 2021. More than a dozen patients, mostly from Texas, arrived at the abortion clinic in Louisiana.\n                \n                    \n                    Rebecca Blackwell/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption A 33-year-old mother of three from central Texas is escorted down the hall by a clinic administrator prior to getting an abortion, at Hope Medical Group for Women in Shreveport, La., in late 2021. More than a dozen patients, mostly from Texas, arrived at the abortion clinic in Louisiana. Still, these laws are not as sweeping as some seem to think, law professor Sepper says, and none should apply in Miller's case. \"First, all of them exempt the pregnant person,\" Sepper explains. \"Second, none of them apply outside the borders of Texas, so abortions performed in Colorado or California are not covered.\" Amy O'Donnell of Texas Alliance for Life, an anti-abortion rights group, concurs with Sepper's interpretation of the law. \"Our Texas Alliance for Life attorneys believe there is a constitutional right to interstate travel,\" she says. \"They believe that Texas will not be able to ban interstate travel for abortion, just as we cannot ban individuals from traveling to another state to participate in casino gambling, which is not legal in Texas.\" Still, whether doctors can openly counsel their patients without violating SB8 is a bit more complicated, and hasn't been tested in court. \"The law's vague \u2013 it's really poorly written, probably on purpose,\" says Palmer, adding, \"Nobody wants to be defendant number one on this.\" Sepper argues many doctors and hospital systems are overreading the Texas abortion bans, and should consider the ethical and professional obligations to give patients complete information about their diagnoses and options. \"Providing information, even providing referrals, is not within the terms of SB8 or the criminal bans,\" she says. When doctors and hospitals won't discuss abortion because they're afraid of lawsuits, she says, \"I think it's a real disservice to patients.\" The reticence on the part of some doctors can have devastating consequences. Dr. Eve Espey is chair of the OB-GYN department at the University of New Mexico, where more and more Texas patients come for abortions they can't get at home. Republican legislators realize ...'we weren't punished at the ballot box. So what is the incentive to do anything different?' Brendan Steinhauser, GOP political strategist, Austin, Texas \"Those restrictive laws are increasing complex abortion care because people come later, and abortions later in gestation are more complicated,\" Espey explains. One of the drivers of those delays is people having no idea that there are options out-of-state, she adds. She recalls one Texas patient whose fetus had acrania, where the fetus has no skull. It's a fatal condition for the fetus. \"That was a doctor who didn't tell her, 'Go get care out-of-state,'\" says Espey. \"She was an immigrant.

Espey believes that there are many doctors in Texas who would like to provide more information to patients but are unsure if they can. \"The Texas abortion laws were designed to sow confusion and fear, and they're working,\" Espey adds. When doctors hear that abortion is illegal and anyone can sue them, they err on the side of caution, rather than practice up to the edge of what's legally allowed. \"People want to stay out of trouble, and physicians are no exception to that.\" One strange aspect of all this, Espey notes, is that pregnant women in Texas still have access to many genetic testing options, available as early as 10 weeks of pregnancy, and very little ability to act on that information.

Attorney General Ken Paxton's office also did not respond to NPR's request to explain how the state plans to enforce Texas's abortion laws, especially in relation to doctors and counseling. Before the elections last fall, a few Republican Texas lawmakers signaled there may be changes to the state's abortion laws coming, specifically, the addition of an exception for abortions of pregnancies that result from rape or incest. But Brendan Steinhauser, a Republican political strategist based in Austin, says his impression is that lawmakers aren't eager to take up new abortion legislation, either to create more exceptions or more restrictions. \"I don't hear a lot about it in the capital,\" Steinhauser says. \"I think that you're probably not going to see a lot of change in the session this year. \" He sees very little political appetite for bringing abortion up again among Republicans lawmakers in the state, because Texas Republicans did well in the last election even after Roe v. Wade was overturned and the state's abortion restrictions took effect. \"I think Republican legislators realize, 'We passed these bills into law, we weren't punished at the ballot box,'\" he says. \"So what is the incentive to do anything different?\" O'Donnell of Texas Alliance for Life, one of the the groups in the state that lobbies for abortion restrictions, says her group is not currently advocating for more restrictions. \"What we're working for in this session is maintaining our pro-life gains,\" she says, adding that the medical emergency exception currently in the law is \"adequate.\" Asked about doctors scared to counsel their patients about abortion when their patients are faced with complications that are not immediately life-threatening, she responded: \"As far as doctors advocating for abortion, our goal is to make abortion not only illegal in our state, but unthinkable.\" There are some lawmakers in the state who would like to go further. The Texas Freedom Caucus, a group of a dozen legislators, released a list of priorities last month that includes \"Stop those aiding and abetting out-of-state abortions by enforcing Texas law.\" A spokesperson for the caucus did not respond to NPR's interview request. Lauren Miller, the Dallas patient who had to travel 800 miles for an abortion, says that if not for the state of Texas and its restrictions, her doctors could have done much more to help her. \"They would have just been able to give information freely, get it scheduled,\" she says. \"It wouldn't become this whole agonizing process of just trying to get information of \u2014 what do we actually need?

Voters in Michigan passed Prop 3, enshrining the right to abortion in the state constitution. One side effect of political division in the states \u2014 blue states getting bluer and red states getting redder \u2014 is that some policies don't have a chance of getting passed by partisan state legislatures, even if a majority of voters back them. But a left-leaning advocacy group called the Fairness Project has created a playbook for using ballot initiatives to go around GOP-led state legislatures. Since 2016, it has backed successful initiatives to raise the minimum wage and expand Medicaid in at least nine states run entirely or mostly by Republicans at the time of the vote. (It also works in Democratically led states.) Now, it's one of several groups gearing up to put abortion rights on the ballot in 2024. But the recent success of such measures in Republican-led states has drawn criticism from lawmakers and helped fuel a raft of attempts to curb ballot measures. When Missouri-based minimum wage advocates wanted to run a statewide ballot initiative in 2017, they turned to the Fairness Project. \"We're sort of figuring things out as we go, and the Fairness Project is a particular expert on this tactic,\" says Missouri Jobs with Justice political director Richard Van Glahn. Kansas City and St. Louis had tried hiking their minimum wages, but those efforts were overruled by state lawmakers. A ballot initiative would raise the minimum wage across the state \u2014 if voters approved it. But winning takes \"more than just motivated people with clipboards,\" says Kelly Hall, executive director of the Fairness Project.

Citizen-initiated ballot measures to change laws or state constitutions are possible in nearly half of U.S. states. To qualify for the ballot, petitions must gather thousands of signatures. Some campaigns then spend tens of millions of dollars to raise awareness among voters. The high cost of campaigns often means they can act as policy vehicles for corporate interests, such as apps employing gig workers or sports betting companies. The Fairness Project, the brainchild of a California-based health care workers union, was created with the idea of using ballot measures to address quality-of-life issues, SEIU-UHW president Dave Regan tells NPR. \"We need to speak to the common good,\" he says. To do that, the Fairness Project partners with local advocacy organizations and national nonprofits to provide the technical expertise needed to run a ballot campaign. That means surveying voters early in the process to gauge whether an issue has enough public support to succeed, and helping to set up signature-gathering. The group also vets the language of the proposed constitutional amendment or statute to make sure it can withstand legal challenges, says Hall. When it comes to public messaging, the Fairness Project tests which narratives will sway the largest number of voters. For example, talking about bringing voters' federal tax dollars back to their state may get more votes for Medicaid expansion than talking about it as a benefit program. \"Folks who can separate these issues from their partisan identity are the folks that get us over the finish line in these conservative states,\" says Hall. Financing is another part of the process. The Fairness Project sometimes contributes directly to the state-level campaigns that they work with, but is rarely the largest donor, according to campaign finance records. Other financial backers of the measures include dark money groups, progressive nonprofits or, in the case of Medicaid expansion, business and health care associations. The Fairness Project, which operates as a 501(c)(4) nonprofit \"social welfare\" organization, does not have to disclose its funders or all of its activities, drawing criticism from a right-leaning research group that investigates environmentalist and union spending. Communications and digital strategy director Alexis Magnan-Callaway declined to share a list of Fairness Project funders with NPR, but says unions, foundations and individuals \"contribute to our work.\" A \"Polling Place\" sign is seen during primary Election Day at Barack Obama Elementary School on Aug. 2, 2022, in St Louis, Mo.\n                \n                    \n                    Michael M.

Since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to abortion last year, all state ballot measures affirming abortion rights have been approved, and all of those to restrict the right have been rejected. The Fairness Project was involved with a $40 million campaign to pass Prop 3 in Michigan last year, which codified abortion rights in that state. It's now exploring such measures in several more states where abortion is restricted or banned. These plans come as state legislatures move to clamp down on the ballot process. Lawmakers in at least four states \u2014 Ohio, Florida, Idaho and Missouri \u2014 have recently introduced or advanced measures to make citizen-initiated measures more difficult to run or to pass. Last year, 11 state legislatures introduced or advanced bills that would introduce new barriers. In Missouri, Republican state Rep. Mike Henderson told his colleagues during a recent session that the state constitution has become too easy to edit. \"I believe that the Missouri constitution is a living document, but not an ever-expanding document,\" he said. Henderson also argued that citizens of Missouri may not understand what they're voting on, and that such campaigns can be intentionally misleading. The state House of Representatives later approved a resolution he proposed, which calls for raising the threshold to pass citizen-initiated ballot measures from a simple majority to 60%. However, Democrats have called the measure itself misleading, because it opens with language about only allowing U.S. citizens to vote, something already enshrined in the Missouri constitution. \"The effort to curtail the initiative process seems to me like a purely political power play,\" says David Kimball, a political scientist at the University of Missouri - St. Louis. He says lawmakers are likely trying to head off future abortion rights ballot measures, and want to keep the power to make laws, or introduce constitutional amendments, for themselves.",

            "article_content": "The Kentucky Supreme Court weighed in on a challenge to the state's abortion bans, saying the two bans should remain in place despite voters rejecting an anti-abortion ballot measure in November.  AILSA CHANG, HOST: And now to Kentucky, where today the state's Supreme Court decided the state's two laws banning abortion should remain in place. The decision comes months after a ballot question in the November election, where a majority of Kentucky voters sided with abortion rights. Now, the decision on whether to ban the procedure goes back to a lower state court. But today's news does not bode well for abortion rights advocates. Divya Karthikeyan, capitol reporter at Kentucky Public Radio, joins us now for more. Welcome. DIVYA KARTHIKEYAN, BYLINE: Thank you. Hi. CHANG: All right. Hi. OK. So break this down a little more for us. What does this decision mean exactly? KARTHIKEYAN: So currently, abortion is illegal in the state of Kentucky. And we have two laws here. We have the trigger law, which automatically bans abortion except in life-threatening cases, and we have a ban on abortion after six weeks. So the Kentucky Supreme Court had heard challenges to those bans. And, you know, we're getting this ruling more than two months later. And this ruling today would allow these two abortion bans to remain in place. Now the Supreme Court here is throwing it back to a lower court to decide on the larger questions here and merits - you know, the main merit being is the right to an abortion a constitutional right at all in Kentucky? We have the right to privacy and self-determination in our state constitution, and that's what abortion rights advocates say their argument is based on. CHANG: And remind us why this case was so closely watched. KARTHIKEYAN: So in June 2022, you know, when Roe v. Wade was overturned, this trigger law immediately came into effect, and that meant nearly all abortions were illegal. This was a law enacted by the legislature in 2019, and there was outcry that these bans were not representative of what Kentuckians wanted. And so voters in Kentucky had this opportunity to weigh in on that in last year's election. We had a constitutional amendment on the ballot that would say there is no right to an abortion in the constitution. We had over 60% of voters cast their ballot in support of abortion rights. This was all happening when we had legal tussle playing out in the courts and a legislature that was mulling on more restrictions. So the abortion rights issue for people in Kentucky really hinge on so many other factors beyond their control. I think that's why it's so closely watched. CHANG: Yeah. So what's been the reaction so far to the state Supreme Court decision? KARTHIKEYAN: So the Republican attorney general - Daniel Cameron, he's also running for governor - he's pursued challenges to abortion rights in the past. And he said, quote, \"this is a significant victory, and we will continue to stand up for the unborn by defending these laws.\" And ACLU Kentucky, which defended the two only abortion providers in court, said the ruling was a huge disappointment. Here's communications director Angela Cooper. ANGELA COOPER: We had hoped that we would be able to resume abortion care in Kentucky since it is an incredibly important health care service. However, we were also prepared for this, and our legal team continues to strategize about how they will approach this with a lower court. CHANG: Well, that's a good question. What exactly happens now in Kentucky in terms of abortion access? KARTHIKEYAN: So abortion remains illegal. We now have a Republican supermajority in our legislature. I've been covering the session very closely. We're seeing a lot of Republicans file some restrictive bills - one this week would treat abortion as homicide. And maybe Republicans might be interested in a bill that would provide exceptions for rape and incest. We don't know yet. The ACLU is saying they're working on a strategy for when the case goes to a lower court. Right now, the only way a pregnant person in Kentucky can get an abortion, unless their life is at risk, is to travel to neighboring states like Illinois or Virginia.

Spain's parliament passed laws on Thursday expanding abortion and transgender rights for teenagers, while making Spain the first country in Europe entitling workers to paid menstrual leave. MADRID \u2014 The Spanish parliament on Thursday approved legislation expanding abortion and transgender rights for teenagers, while making Spain the first country in Europe that will entitle workers to paid menstrual leave. The driving force behind the two laws was Equality Minister Irene Montero, who belongs to the junior member in Spain's left-wing coalition government, the \"United We Can\" Party. The changes to sexual and reproductive rights mean that 16- and 17-year-olds in Spain can now undergo an abortion without parental consent. Period products will now be offered free in schools and prisons, while state-run health centers will do the same with hormonal contraceptives and the morning after pill. The menstrual leave measure allows workers suffering debilitating period pain to take paid time off. In addition, the changes enshrine in law the right to have an abortion in a state hospital. Currently more than 80% of termination procedures in Spain are carried out in private clinics due to a high number of doctors in the public system who refuse to perform them \u2014 with many citing religious reasons. Under the new system, state hospital doctors won't be forced to carry out abortions, provided they've already registered their objections in writing. The abortion law builds on legislation passed in 2010 that represented a major shift for a traditionally Catholic country, transforming Spain into one of the most progressive countries in Europe on reproductive rights. Spain's constitutional court last week rejected a challenge by the right-wing Popular Party against allowing abortions in the first 14 weeks of pregnancy. A separate package of reforms also approved by lawmakers on Thursday strengthened transgender rights, including allowing any citizen over 16 years old to change their legally registered gender without medical supervision. Minors between 12-13 years old will need a judge's authorization to change, while those between 14 and 16 must be accompanied by their parents or legal guardians. Previously, transgender people needed a diagnosis by several doctors of gender dysphoria. The second law also bans so-called \"conversion therapy\" for LGBTQ people and provides state support for lesbians and single women seeking IVF treatment. The center-left coalition government is currently under fire for another of Montero's star projects, a new sexual consent law that was intended to increase protection against rape but has inadvertently allowed hundreds of sex offenders to have prison sentences reduced. The \"Only Yes Means Yes\" Law makes verbal consent the key component in cases of alleged sexual assault. The government is now struggling to come up with an amended version and end the controversy ahead of elections later this year. The three initiatives have met strong opposition from the right-wing parties that form Spain's main opposition bloc.",

            "article_content": "A day ahead of a planned \"special announcement\" in South Carolina, former governor of that state and Trump administration official announced her run for president in a video posted on Twitter.  LEILA FADEL, HOST: Former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley made it official Tuesday, announcing her run for president in a video posted on Twitter. A day ahead of a special announcement in Charleston, Haley called for a new generation of leadership. Haley becomes just the second major candidate to announce a campaign for the Republican nomination and is the first to challenge former President Donald Trump, her boss when she served in his administration as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. Haley previously said she wouldn't challenge Trump for the nomination if he ran. Obviously, a lot to break down here after this announcement. So here to help us do just that is NPR political correspondent Danielle Kurtzleben. Hi, Danielle. DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN, BYLINE: Hey, good morning. FADEL: Good morning. So what stood out to you about this video? KURTZLEBEN: I mean, to me, it's that Haley is really trying to straddle some really particular lines in messaging about who she is in a Republican Party that isn't - that is fractured and that could be very much more fractured by a lot of people jumping in. So in this video, on the one hand, she references very standard, really traditional Republican ideas. For example, she says the party needs to rediscover financial responsibility. She says that she is there to fight the Washington establishment. Those are very standard Republican language right there. But she also references very current culture war issues, particularly race. Here's one line from very early in the ad. (SOUNDBITE OF POLITICAL AD) NIKKI HALEY: Some look at our past as evidence that America's founding principles are bad. They say the promise of freedom is just made up. Some think our ideas are not just wrong but racist and evil. Nothing could be further from the truth. KURTZLEBEN: And I should say that that's over imagery that references The New York Times' \"1619 Project,\" which told the story of America's founding through the lens of slavery. It's also over imagery of people protesting racism, as well as progressive lawmaker Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Now, as a woman of color running for president on the Republican side, that's some very particular messaging. It makes it clear, hey, I fall in with my fellow Republicans. Even though, you know, I grew up different, I want to unite people. And Republicans, of course, often criticize Democrats as divisive in how they talk about race. FADEL: So still going on with the anti-wokeness platforms we've seen from other... KURTZLEBEN: Very much. FADEL: ...Republican candidate - Republican officials. Remind us of Haley's political resume. KURTZLEBEN: Yeah. So she started out in the South Carolina Statehouse in 2004, and then she was twice elected governor of South Carolina, in 2010 and 2014. And as a governor, she was - she took a lot of conservative stands. She signed a law restricting abortion after 20 weeks with exceptions for the pregnant person's life, but that was seen as very much a very staunch conservative stand. That was, of course, while Roe was still in effect. One other thing that really marked her governorship was that she signed the law taking down the Confederate flag from the state capitol grounds after the horrific shooting at Mother AME in Charleston. That was, of course, a - is a church that is a Black church. And so that was very much seen as a divisive, racist incident, to say the least. So that is something that will definitely come up in this race. FADEL: What does Haley's announcement tell us about the broader 2024 landscape now? KURTZLEBEN: Well, first of all, that you're going to have people like her who were, at one point, very anti-Trump, who then embraced him and are now going to run against him. So there is going to be a lot of that with her, potentially Mike Pence, who is headed to Iowa this week, and also that you are just going to potentially have a really, really big race of people jumping in after her.

            "article_content": "Vice President Kamala Harris marked the 50th anniversary of Roe v Wade Sunday. She spoke about the path forward on reproductive rights after the Supreme Court overturned that landmark decision.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Vice President Harris was in Tallahassee, Fla., yesterday to give a speech on abortion access. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: We know this fight will not be won until we secure this right for every American. INSKEEP: It was the anniversary of Roe v. Wade, the decision by the Supreme Court that established a constitutional right to abortion, which did not quite last 50 years. NPR political reporter Deepa Shivaram was traveling with the vice president. Good morning. DEEPA SHIVARAM, BYLINE: Hey, Steve. Good morning. INSKEEP: I guess we should note last year's court decision threw this fight mainly to the states. So what has the administration been doing at the federal level? SHIVARAM: Yeah. The top line from Vice President Harris' remarks yesterday was announcing a new memorandum that the president signed. It directs agencies in the administration, like the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Justice, to look into how they can protect access to medicated abortions. And Harris yesterday also warned that because of certain abortion restrictions, people have lost basic access to care and medications. And she called on Congress to codify Roe v. Wade, though, with this Congress, that's not going to happen. INSKEEP: Yeah. SHIVARAM: But overall, her speech was a continuation of what Harris has been doing for the last several months on this issue - trying to rally advocates and stakeholders all over the country and show solidarity. She took the stage yesterday wearing green, which has become the color of the reproductive rights movement. INSKEEP: Well, how did those advocates respond? SHIVARAM: Yeah, there were people from all over Florida who came in for this event, some people who took nine-hour bus rides from other parts of the state to come. And people were pretty fired up. There's already restricted access to abortions in Florida. And the Republican-led legislature is trying to pass more restrictions in the coming year. But Harris told the crowd not to be tired or discouraged in their fight because they are, quote, \"on the right side of history.\" And for the advocates I talked to, they felt a sense of relief. They had this feeling that there was someone from the White House coming and joining them in this fight. One person that I talked to who was at the event yesterday said that she felt there was a boost in morale after Harris' speech because Florida often feels like a lost cause on reproductive rights. And that kind of enthusiasm and mobilization is exactly what the White House is trying to lean into. They want people engaged on this issue the same way they were going into the midterm elections last year. INSKEEP: Was giving this speech in the capital of Florida aimed in any way at the governor of Florida, Ron DeSantis, who is thought to be considering a presidential run in 2024? SHIVARAM: Yeah. Doing the speech in Tallahassee was strategic. We were just a few miles from Florida's Capitol building and the governor's mansion. And while Harris didn't mention DeSantis by name, she did take a word that he often uses, which is freedom, and tried to flip the script. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) HARRIS: Can we truly be free if a woman cannot make decisions about her own body? UNIDENTIFIED CROWD: (Shouting) No. HARRIS: Can we truly be free if a doctor cannot care for her patients? UNIDENTIFIED CROWD: (Shouting) No. HARRIS: Can we truly be free if families cannot make intimate decisions about the course of their own lives? UNIDENTIFIED CROWD: (Shouting) No. SHIVARAM: And Harris went on to refer to officials who are restricting abortion access as so-called leaders and said they were attacking the very foundations of freedom. So it was interesting to see how she kind of took on DeSantis without actually calling him out. And so far, we haven't heard a response from the governor. INSKEEP: NPR political reporter Deepa Shivaram, thanks so much. SHIVARAM: Thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2023 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Wade.\n\n                    \n                    Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Protesters gather outside the U.S. Supreme Court on June 25, 2022 in the wake of the decision overturning Roe v. Wade. In June 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization struck down Roe v. Wade, the 1973 landmark ruling that guaranteed the right to an abortion. Without Roe, the Court's decision left it up to the states to decide on the legality of abortion and the restrictions surrounding it. Legal scholar Mary Ziegler chronicles the legal, political and cultural debate around abortion in the new book, Roe: The History of a National Obsession. She says the battle over abortion rights is far from over. \"We're at a moment of really almost unprecedented uncertainty in the United States when it comes to abortion,\" Ziegler says. \"Lots of people are waking up to the reality that what was a constitutional right not very long ago is now a crime in large swaths of the country.\" Some states, including California, Michigan, Kansas and South Carolina, have responded to the Dobbs decision by protecting legal access to abortion. Meanwhile, more than a dozen other states, including Idaho, Tennessee, Arkansas and Texas, have moved to enact sweeping abortion bans. In Texas, for instance, abortion is a felony punishable by up to life in prison. The state's law explicitly prohibits criminally prosecuting people seeking abortions. Instead, it focuses on abortion providers, as well as people who aid or abet them \u2014 including those who help fund abortions. Then there are states where abortion is legal, but hasn't been explicitly protected as a right in a state's constitution or by court decisions. Ziegler points to Florida, which, because it has more liberal abortion laws that its neighboring states, is considered a \"receiving state,\" for people seeking abortion. \"Florida, at the moment, has a 15-week ban, but nothing more than that,\" she says. \"We expect to see some of those states [like Florida] become battlegrounds in the years ahead.\" While Ziegler acknowledges that no one knows what the future of abortion rights in the U.S. will look like, one thing is certain: This is a story that's larger than one court decision. \"The story of our abortion politics has always been one about more than the Supreme Court telling us what to do,\" she says. \"It's been grassroots movements. It's been ordinary voters, it's been legislatures, it's been state courts. And that's going to continue to be true. So I think we're at the very beginning of something very confusing, but also something that is far, far from over.\" Roe: The History of a National Obsession, by Mary Ziegler\n                \n                    \n                    Yale University Press\n                    \n                \nhide caption Roe: The History of a National Obsession, by Mary Ziegler On how confusion about abortion law can stop people from exercising their right to an abortion A lot of people, if they're not sure what is and is not OK, may make the decision to not come close to crossing the line. They may be scared away from exercising a right they do, in fact, have. But I think we're at a moment of really almost unprecedented uncertainty in the United States when it comes to abortion. That's true of the laws. It's true of the way abortion care is delivered. It's true, frankly, of the strategies that are being pursued by both movements. I think the kind of old hierarchies in the movements on both sides were shaken up by the Dobbs decision and the political developments of the past couple of years. On Texas prosecutors targeting abortion funds Abortion funds kind of emerged because it was very difficult for low-income people to pay for abortions because of the Hyde Amendment, which bans federal Medicaid monies being used for reimbursement for abortions. So these abortion funds have been an important part of the funding reality for decades. And these demand letters that were sent to the abortion funds in Texas essentially suggested that they had been aiding and abetting a criminal act and demanded, among other things, details about their patients' information. And I think this has been frightening for people who support abortion rights, not only because of what it would mean for abortion funds, which, as I mentioned, are kind of the only way that low-income people have been able to reliably access money for abortion, but also because they suggest at least the possibility that people who have abortions will be somehow swept into the criminal system too. On how federal health privacy law doesn't protect a lot of digital privacy If you're on Facebook talking to your friends about whether you're going to have an abortion, that's not protected by HIPAA. Mary Ziegler There's lots of information related to reproductive health services that doesn't come from HIPAA-protected sources. Abortion funds are not medical providers. If you're on Facebook talking to your friends about whether you're going to have an abortion, that's not protected by HIPAA. If you're using your phone and you're using Google Maps to get to a clinic and Google sells that data to various advertisers, there's nothing theoretically stopping law enforcement from purchasing the same data. So in a world where abortion is a crime, it's a reminder of how little digital privacy many of us already have. On how are anti-abortion activists using the Comstock Act (an 1873 law that prohibits mailing \"obscene\" materials) to target pills by mail The anti-abortion movement read the Comstock Act to say that it's illegal to mail abortion pills anywhere \u2014 full stop \u2014 for any purpose. And so that would be tantamount to saying abortion pills themselves are entirely illegal because all abortion pills that any patient in the United States takes have been in the mail in some way or another. Abortion clinics are not manufacturing their own pills; they're purchasing them from drug companies, pharmacies or getting them in the mail. People having telehealth procedures are getting them in the mail for the moment. This argument isn't going to go anywhere, likely because the Justice Department just put out a memorandum saying that, for the time being, the federal government interprets the Comstock Act to only apply to people who are mailing abortion [pills] with criminal intention. That is to say, deliberately trying to violate laws against those abortion pills, which would make it much harder to prosecute anyone under the Comstock Act. But anti-abortion activists who are invoking the Comstock Act are really playing the long game. They're hoping either, 1) through lawsuits to get arguments about the Comstock Act before the Supreme Court, which is very conservative on abortion and may agree with anti-abortion activists' interpretation of the Comstock Act, or, 2) just bide time until a Republican is in the White House and a Republican [Department of Justice] takes a different interpretation of the Comstock Act. So we're seeing this argument crop up in lawsuits. We're seeing it crop up in local ordinances passed by small towns in blue, red and purple states that mention the Comstock Act. So it's become a kind of central part of strategy in some quarters in the anti-abortion movement. On questions around the legality of traveling out of state for an abortion There are pre-file bills in places like Texas and Missouri that try to put a stop to out-of-state travel for abortion. For the most part, based on the pre-file bills we're seeing, states are not directly saying, \"We're going to criminalize travel or allow people to be sued for traveling.\" They're going more kind of indirect routes where they're either allowing kind of SB8 [Texas Senate Bill 8.]-style \"bounties\" against people who help others travel for abortion, people who maybe perform abortions for people from states where it's criminal, kind of focusing on doctors and aiders or abettors. What's unusual about that, obviously, is that one state usually can't tell another state what to do. Imagine a woman from Mississippi travels to South Carolina where there's now going to have to be legal abortion and has an abortion. And then Mississippi says, \"Well, we're going to prosecute the doctor in Mississippi for this abortion.\" Usually we don't do things like that. We haven't done things like that really since before the Civil War, when there were fugitive slave laws in place. Mary Ziegler Imagine a woman from Mississippi travels to South Carolina where there's now going to have to be legal abortion and has an abortion. And then Mississippi says, \"Well, we're going to prosecute the doctor in Mississippi for this abortion.\" Usually we don't do things like that. We haven't done things like that really since before the Civil War, when there were fugitive slave laws in place. So it creates all kinds of uncertainty about whose law would apply. Would it be Mississippi's or South Carolina's in that hypothetical? Would it be constitutional for Mississippi to tell South Carolina doctors what to do? Or would that raise all kinds of red flags constitutionally? We don't know any of the answers to that. And again, the one thing we do know is that they would most likely land before the same U.S. Supreme Court that reversed Roe v. Wade, which is why state legislators are willing to try things out that are unprecedented in recent history and potentially constitutionally questionable as well. On the anti-abortion movement's crack down on free speech and information If people don't know what their options are, in other words, they don't know where the clinic out of state is, they don't know how to get abortion pills in the mail, or they don't know how to use them safely, or how late in pregnancy it's safe to do so, some people quite simply aren't going to have those abortions. And so I think the effort to crack down on speech has not just been about advocacy, it's been about access to information \u2013 online as well as offline. ... There's been a kind of concerted effort to ... prevent people from accessing kind of basic information about what medication abortion involves or what kinds of services might be available in nearby states.

U.S. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas accepted luxury vacations from a major GOP donor, according to a new ProPublica investigation, renewing the call from Democrats for a code of ethics at the high court. The ProPublica investigation raises a series of potential conflicts of interest between Thomas and Harlan Crow, a billionaire businessman. Crow took Thomas and his wife, Ginni Thomas, on vacations, including cruises and private flights, that could cost millions of dollars; Thomas did not report them as part of his annual financial disclosure, according to the report. Neither Thomas nor the Supreme Court has commented on the details of the ProPublica investigation. But plenty of Democratic members of Congress did. \"The highest court in the land shouldn't have the lowest ethical standards,\" said Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin, who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee. \"This behavior is simply inconsistent with the ethical standards the American people expect of any public servant, let alone a Justice on the Supreme Court.\" The backlash came from Democrats in both chambers. Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Josh Harder, Judy Chu and Ilhan Omar all took to Twitter to voice either their disapproval in Thomas or their support of creating an ethical standard or code for the Supreme Court. This is beyond party or partisanship. This degree of corruption is shocking - almost cartoonish. Thomas must be impeached.Barring some dramatic change, this is what the Roberts court will be known for: rank corruption, erosion of democracy, and the stripping of human rights. https://t.co/t8fnGLVhbV Senate Judiciary Committee Democrats Cory Booker and Alex Padilla also issued statements. \"There is no reason that the justices who sit on the highest court in the country should continue to be held to ethical standards that are lower than those of any employee of our federal government,\" said Booker in a statement. \"It underscores why we must implement a binding, enforceable code of conduct for the Supreme Court. Americans deserve a Supreme Court that is beyond reproach, commands respect, and does not undermine people's faith in our justice system.\" Padilla also chimed in on the need for a code of ethics. \"Justices must be held to the same rigorous ethical standards as other public officials \u2014 Thomas' actions make crystal clear that we need an enforceable code of ethics for the Supreme Court,\" Padilla said in a statement to NPR. And Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, who is also on the Judiciary Committee, took to Twitter to criticize Thomas. They were joined by Sens. Jeff Merkley, Elizabeth Warren, Chris Murphy and Ed Markey, among others, who also called for a code of ethics. \"The billionaire we are talking about here, Harlan Crow, he's not just a businessman he's also deeply involved in politics,\" ProPublica reporter Justin Elliot told Morning Edition. \"He is on the board of think tanks that do Supreme Court advocacy and he has been involved in sort of right-wing legal politics for years.\" Crow sits on the board of the Hoover Institution, a conservative think tank, the board of trustees at the American Enterprise Institute and, according to ProPublica, was \"an early patron of the powerful anti-tax group Club for Growth.\" Crow told ProPublica that his \"hospitality\" to Thomas was \"no different from the hospitality we have extended to our many other dear friends.\" The U.S. Supreme Court is the only judicial body in the country not governed by a code of ethics. Such a code has been previously supported by members of both parties though there hasn't been enough bipartisan support to approve measures introduced. Justice Thomas and his wife were at the center of the debate over whether or not the court should adopt a code of ethics last year after news reports that Ginni Thomas exchanged text messages with then-White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, asking him to take steps to overturn the 2020 elections in favor of former President Donald Trump. Also last year, Justice Samuel Alito came under fire after The New York Times reported that he had shared with a conservative activist in advance of the court's opinion the decision of Burwell v. Hobby Lobby, the landmark decision that allowed private for-profit corporations to decline to provide their employees access to contraception. Alito denied the claim. Earlier this year, the Project on Government Oversight and the Lawyers Defending American Democracy each attempted to write a Supreme Court Ethics code. But a lack of political consensus \u2014 or indeed within the court iself \u2014 has prevented any progress on an official code. According to the Congressional Research Service, \"Legislative proposals to impose a code of conduct on the Supreme Court raise an array of legal questions\" and there are outstanding questions over how such a code would be enforced and whether or not the court, which determines the constitutionality of laws, would accept it.",

The State of the Union represents a chance for the president to address the nation on where he thinks the country stands, where it is headed and what his priorities are ahead of an expected announcement that he will officially run for reelection. But President Biden, who turned 80 this past November, has quite the task ahead of him. Despite an unemployment rate that is the lowest since 1969, Americans continue to be in a sour mood about the direction of the country. Two-thirds say it is headed in the wrong direction, and a majority disapproves of the job Biden is doing as president. That's true not just on the economy and inflation, but on issues ranging from crime and guns to immigration and the war in Ukraine. At the same time, despite the prevailing sour sentiment, Democrats did better than expected in the midterms, and they were able to pass significant legislation in the past two years. Partisanship seems to be fueling the negativity and when compared to former President Trump, the current front-runner for the GOP nomination, Biden is usually even or ahead in head-to-head polls and favorability ratings. Biden's instinct is to call for unity and strike an optimistic tone. But that will be challenged Tuesday with newly divided leadership in Washington. It will be made all the more obvious for viewers at home with a face they haven't seen before over Biden's left shoulder, recently minted House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., whose conference is intent on putting Biden's administration \u2014 and his son \u2014 under the microscope. Here are several issue areas \u2014 China, climate, COVID-19 and health, education, economy, gun violence, immigration, infrastructure, opioids, policing, reproductive rights and Ukraine \u2014 and the challenges Biden faces in addressing each: China looms large for the Biden administration, underpinning its foreign policy and animating parts of its domestic economic policy. Biden will almost certainly depict China as a strategic competitor, a challenge to the \"global rules-based order\" and a threat to America's tech supremacy. The recent spy balloon episode may also come up, with Biden potentially painting it as a challenge he handled deftly \u2013 and an indicator of how real the threat from China is. Where China is not mentioned, it will be a subtext under many issues Biden may discuss. Hopes for improved relations were buoyed in recent months following Biden's meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in Bali in November. There has also been talk of a face-to-face summit in the fall. However, last week's balloon saga seems to have put efforts at rapprochement on the backburner, at least in the near term. -- John Ruwitch, NPR China affairs correspondent From a national security standpoint, the president is likely to want to talk about his efforts to strengthen U.S. military alliances in Asia, and efforts to prevent any military confrontation over Taiwan. The Chinese balloon is not considered a significant issue in the big picture, but Biden is likely to address it. -- Greg Myre, NPR national security correspondent How much will Biden talk about climate change? Last year there were just brief mentions and that seemed unusual for someone who made climate change a significant part of his campaign. This year he has the climate-focused Inflation Reduction Act to brag about, it's likely he'll mention that as a success. Also likely: a mention of the electric vehicle and appliance tax credits people can take advantage of. But will he give any indication of when or how the Biden administration's EPA will establish regulations on carbon dioxide emissions from power plants \u2014 or indications of how his administration will fully implement and protect key elements of the IRA? The legislation gets the country to 40% greenhouse gas emissions reductions \u2013 Biden's goal is 50-52% by 2030 (based on 2005 levels). Will he propose anything for the last 10%? And will he reinforce his target for electric vehicles \u2013 50% of new car sales by 2030 \u2013 or start deemphasizing it as 2030 gets closer? -- Jeff Brady, NPR climate and energy correspondent, and Camila Domonoske, NPR business desk reporter Biden has been able to deliver on many of his promises from last year, and he will almost certainly be touting those accomplishments: There are challenges ahead, though, especially as the public health emergency ends. Biden wasn't able to secure new COVID funding last year and faces House GOP investigations over his administration's handling of the pandemic. And millions of people stand to lose Medicaid coverage in the coming year, which could reverse gains on health insurance. -- Selena Simmons-Duffin, NPR health policy reporter Biden will almost certainly tout his efforts to erase up to $20,000 in federal student loan debt per borrower. Late last month, the White House trumpeted the fact that 26 million people had already applied or were automatically qualified for relief, and 16 million had been approved; whether they get that relief now depends on the U.S. Supreme Court. On Pell grants, he'll likely highlight a promise he made in last year's State of the Union and kept: that the White House and Congress recently agreed to a $500 increase in the maximum, per-year Pell grant award. The administration says that keeps them on track to double Pell by 2029. -- Cory Turner, correspondent/senior editor for NPR's education team Biden is likely to devote a lot of the speech to the economy, which has weathered the pandemic and the war in better shape than might be expected, even if there's a lot of teeth gnashing over inflation. Likely topics include: U.S oil production is also expected to set a record this year, despite GOP complaints that the administration has stifled home-grown fossil fuels. How much credit the president's policies deserve for any of this is debatable, just as one can debate how much blame the American Rescue Plan deserves for inflation, which hit a four-decade high last summer. But Biden may claim vindication for his efforts to build an economy that works from the bottom up and the middle out. -- Scott Horsley, NPR chief economics correspondent After each mass shooting that has happened on his watch, President Biden has called on Congress to ban assault-style guns. In November, after a shooting in Colorado Springs, Biden said: \"The idea we still allow semi automatic weapons to be purchased is sick. It's just sick,\" he said. \"Not a single, solitary rationale for it except profit for the gun manufacturers.\" After two recent shootings in California, Biden is likely to repeat the plea. The last Congress \u2013 where Democrats had a slim majority in both houses \u2013 passed its first piece of gun safety legislation in three decades. That bill included funding for red-flag laws and prevents people who assault their partners from buying guns, among other measures. There are steep odds against any broader action on guns in the new divided Congress. Still, gun safety activists are pushing for more executive action on the issue. -- Roberta Rampton, NPR White House editor For most of his presidency, President Biden has avoided talking about immigration and the U.S.-Mexico border \u2014 and it's not hard to see why. Record migrant apprehensions at the border over the past two years have made it difficult for the Biden administration to advance its immigration agenda in Congress, and courts have blocked many of its attempts to shape immigration policy. Republicans who now control the House of Representatives have launched a series of hearings on what they call the \"crisis\" at the southern border, and have threatened to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. The chances of a legislative compromise on immigration seem smaller than ever. Still, there's a chance Biden will use this speech to tout his administration's latest enforcement measures, which he announced last month before his first visit to the border as president. Immigration authorities say they're working, at least so far. The number of migrant apprehensions at the border dropped about 40% in January compared to December, the biggest monthly decline of Biden's presidency. -- Joel Rose, NPR national desk correspondent Expect the president to spend some time talking up one of his signature accomplishments, the $1.2 trillion Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Biden has been traveling the country to announce huge grants to finance some megaprojects, including funding to repair and replace Amtrak and commuter rail tunnels into Baltimore and New York City that are 150 and 113 years old respectively, as well as funding for a new bridge over the Ohio River connecting Cincinnati and Kentucky. In addition to highlighting long overdue spending to expand, repair and build new roads, rails, bridges, ports, pipes, dams and airports, the president will likely tout investments in climate resilient and green energy infrastructure, as well as EV charging stations. Biden may also highlight the $800 million in grants announced recently to localities to make streets, sidewalks, crosswalks and bike lanes safer to stem the recent sharp increase in pedestrian and cyclist injuries and fatalities. It'll be noteworthy if he pushes for new funding to upgrade the FAA's technology after a critical system failure last month led to the first nationwide ground stop of all airline flights since Sept. 11, 2001. -- David Schaper, NPR national desk reporter Street fentanyl is fueling a devastating public health crisis that killed 107,000 people in the U.S. last year. Biden is under enormous pressure to stop the flow of fentanyl into the U.S. from China and Mexico. But convincing those two countries to help stop fentanyl trafficking is hard, especially at a time when other big issues, like immigration and Taiwan, keep getting in the way. So far the Biden administration hasn't had much success. In his speech Biden may focus on providing treatment for people with addiction. His team has made some real progress on that front: there's a lot more federal money now for drug treatment and the White House has also fulfilled one of Biden's promises, cutting government red tape that prevented many doctors from helping patients with substance use disorder. -- Brian Mann, NPR national desk correspondent Biden is likely to call to revive the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, legislation that's been stalled in the Senate for almost two years. The bill is a grab-bag of law enforcement accountability measures, such as a ban on certain neck restraints, the creation of a national database of misconduct complaints and disciplinary actions against officers and the restriction of no-knock warrants. The changes would apply to federal law enforcement, and offers incentives for state and local police to follow suit. The biggest sticking point in the Senate has been the legislation's change to the \"qualified immunity\" doctrine, which critics say makes it too hard to sue police for civil rights violations. Biden signed an executive order last May, applying portions of the act to federal police \u2014 for instance, the database to track misconduct \u2014 but he continued to call for passage of the full legislation. Interest in the bill was revived late last month by Vice President Harris, who had a hand in writing it when she was a senator. At the funeral for Tyre Nichols, killed by Memphis police officers, Harris and other speakers called for the act to be passed. -- Martin Kaste, NPR national desk correspondent Biden has faced criticism in the past from abortion rights activists who've seen him as failing to speak strongly enough about his support for abortion rights, including from leading Democrats including Sen. Patty Murray who felt he was too slow to take action in response to the Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization decision in June 2022. In recent years, activists have used hashtags like #SayAbortionJoe to urge the president to speak more forcefully about the issue, particularly in major speeches like the State of the Union. Without Roe v. Wade and without control of Congress, there's now little Biden can do to stop Republican-controlled states from implementing abortion bans. But his base supporters will be looking to him for leadership, policy solutions and a commitment to continue the fight. Biden may also try to build on the momentum that many reproductive rights advocates are feeling after the 2022 midterms, when voters in several states with abortion-related ballot measures voted to support abortion rights. His challenge will be to maintain that momentum as he approaches the 2024 election. -- Sarah McCammon, NPR national desk correspondent The Ukraine war is at a crucial juncture. Russia launched a full-scale invasion on Feb. 24 last year. As we approach that one-year mark, there's widespread speculation that both Russia and Ukraine are looking to launch offensives in the near future. Under Biden, the U.S. has been the leading supplier of military aid to Ukraine, and his speech may provide additional clues as to the kind of assistance that's likely to come next. For example, Ukraine is now seeking F-16 fighter jets, but Biden says he will not be sending the planes because the U.S. does not consider them a good fit for Ukraine. -- Greg Myre, NPR national security correspondent",

President Biden has decided to choose his former COVID-19 response coordinator as his new chief of staff, replacing Ron Klain. President Biden has selected Jeff Zients as his next chief of staff, choosing his former COVID-19 response coordinator to take over from Ron Klain, who is preparing to leave the White House sometime after the State of Union address on Feb. 7. The transition comes after two years where the administration notched some significant legislative wins. Biden has said implementing the sweeping spending on infrastructure, semiconductor manufacturing and climate is one of his biggest tasks for the year ahead \u2014 and Biden said Zients was the right person to lead that push. \"When I ran for office, I promised to make government work for the American people. That's what Jeff does,\" Biden said in a statement. Zients also joins ahead of two years of looming investigations from Congress \u2014 and a special counsel probe into classified documents found in Biden's personal files \u2014 some from his years as vice president, others dating back to his time as a senator. The White House has been criticized for its uneven public disclosure in the matter, even as Biden has been defiant that he has \"no regrets\" about how the issue has been handled. Zients will manage the White House as Biden weighs whether to make good on his intention to seek a second term in office, and as the White House prepares to face a series of congressional investigations on issues ranging from the business dealings and personal problems of Biden's son Hunter, to the migrant crisis at the southern U.S. border. In this file photo, Jeff Zients, then the COVID-19 response coordinator, stands with other members of Biden's inner circle: adviser Mike Donilon, chief of staff Ron Klain and adviser Anita Dunn.\n                \n                    \n                    Alex Wong/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption In this file photo, Jeff Zients, then the COVID-19 response coordinator, stands with other members of Biden's inner circle: adviser Mike Donilon, chief of staff Ron Klain and adviser Anita Dunn. Zients, an early hire on Biden's transition team, developed the strategy unveiled on Inauguration Day to get Americans vaccinated for COVID-19. He led the response until April 2022, and has close ties to Biden's other top advisers and cabinet members. Zients told author Chris Whipple for his new book The Fight of His Life: Inside Joe Biden's White House that being able to deliver on plans is key. \"A lot of time, energy and creativity go into making policy, whether that's legislation or executive action,\" Zients said in the book. \"But sometimes in government, not enough time and energy and creativity go into execution.\" Ted Kaufman, a Biden confidante and friend who helped manage his transition, told NPR that Zients is \"one of the best managers that I've ever seen\" and said that is key for Biden at this juncture. \"One of the biggest issues if he runs for president, it will be: is the government functioning?\" Kaufman said. A management consultant before he entered public service during the Obama administration, Zients was the acting head of the Office Management and Budget when he was pulled in to the push to fix the healthcare.gov website in 2013. Cecilia Mu\u00f1oz worked with Zients in the Obama White House. She said his temperament and work ethic will help him as chief. \"It's a ferociously difficult job, but he is maybe the most even-keeled person I know. And part of the magic is that there's just no ego investment. He's really all about what he's trying to get done,\" Mu\u00f1oz said. Klain is a prolific user of Twitter, describing the platform as his \"hobby.\" Zients, who has strong relationships in the business community, does not tweet. Zients has run an investment fund and served on Facebook's board of directors. His time in the private sector raised red flags for Jeff Hauser, who heads the Revolving Door Project, who wants the White House to take the lead in going after corporate America for abuses. \"Jeffrey Zients is not just a successful business person. He is somebody who has been involved in many of the industries that the American people are most angry about,\" Hauser told NPR. But Biden, in his statement making Zients' pick official, said his new chief of staff \"shares my focus on strengthening our economy to work for everyone.\" Ron Klain walks with Democratic Sen.

Joe Manchin to see President Biden sign the Inflation Reduction Act into law on Aug. 16, 2022. Biden, who has known Klain for 36 years, called him \"as tough, smart, determined, and persistent as anyone I have ever met.\" He helped the party defy the odds and maintain control of the Senate in the midterm elections, despite the president's own stubbornly low approval ratings. Author Whipple, who spoke with Klain for his new book, and has studied White House chiefs of staff, said Klain stands out as one of the most successful chiefs in recent history. \"His greatest asset is his relationship with Joe Biden,\" said Whipple. \"You have to be able to work closely with the president. You have to be able to manage him. You can't really be too close to him. You can't be a friend because you have to be able to tell him what he doesn't want to hear in a decisive moment. And that's a very fine balancing act. And I think Ron Klain has been able to do it.\" One of those moments came ahead of the 2021 midterm elections, when Biden wanted to \"go everywhere and talk about everything, essentially,\" to try to help his party win, Whipple said. Instead, Klain and Biden's political team convinced the president to focus on a narrow list of states and two main issues: reproductive rights, and the threat posed to democracy by 'MAGA Republicans.' Klain felt vindicated by the election results, Whipple said, describing an email he received from the chief of staff at 1:16 a.m. after it was clear Democrats did far better than expected. \"Maybe we don't suck as much as people thought,\" Klain said in that email.

The job of chief of staff is all-consuming. \"There's a reason why the average tenure of a White House chief is 18 months,\" Whipple said. In October 2021, a low point in Biden's presidency when it seemed that his push for his 'Build Back Better' agenda had failed, Klain wanted to quit, Whipple said. Biden was on his way to the U.N. climate summit in Glasgow, empty-handed, when Whipple visited Klain at the White House. \"Ron said to me at that point that he was exhausted and he was thinking about leaving,\" Whipple said. \"That's how relentless and grueling and exhausting that job can be.\" But Klain's wife Monica Medina \u2014 a high-ranking State Department official who works on climate and environment portfolios \u2014 convinced him to stay on, Whipple said. He said Klain concluded he needed to see Biden through the midterms.

The Senate confirmed 97 federal judges during President Biden's first two years in office, setting records for the sheer numbers of jurists and their diversity. In the end, federal courts may be one of Biden's deepest legacies, since judges often get the last word on what the law means and how it plays out in people's lives. White House chief of staff Ron Klain said the judiciary has been a \"top priority\" for the president, and there's a simple reason why. \"When he talks about rights and liberties, he knows that in the end those rights and liberties are decided by federal judges, so the makeup of the federal judiciary is connected to everything else we do,\" Klain said. White House lawyer Paige Herwig says the effort is a \"sea change\" designed to make the courts look like the rest of America. \"We've confirmed 74 women as federal judges during this administration so far,\" Herwig said. \"That's actually more than were confirmed during the four years of President Trump's term or during the eight years of President George W. Bush's administration.\" That total includes Dana Douglas, the first woman of color ever to serve on the 5th Circuit appeals court and Doris Pryor, the first Black woman ever to sit on the 7th Circuit appeals court from Indiana. In all, Biden has nominated and helped win confirmation for 11 Black women to sit on the appeals courts, more than all other presidents combined. \"Our federal judiciary will finally begin to reflect the diversity of this country and the diversity of experiences that Black women in particular can bring to the bench,\" said Janai Nelson, president of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. Biden's first move on judges involved promoting Ketanji Brown Jackson to the federal appeals court in Washington, D.C. Judge Jackson is now Justice Jackson. Last year, she became the first Black woman on the Supreme Court. She's also the first justice who worked as a public defender. The area of professional diversity has been another focus of Biden's judge machine: picking lawyers with experience representing individual clients. \"They're public defenders representing people accused of crimes; they're civil rights lawyers; they're lawyers who are representing people who might have been discriminated against or harmed by defective products,\" said Christopher Kang of the group Demand Justice, which advocates for court reform and progressive-leaning judges. Kang said Biden has already changed the face of the federal judiciary in a way that could linger for decades, since federal judges can serve for life. That imprint \"is one that might be the most durable in his entire legacy as a president,\" added Nelson, of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. In 2023, the Senate will remain in the control of Democrats, who have mostly voted in lockstep to support Biden's judges. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a recent statement that they're just getting started. It's unlikely Biden can shift the balance of power on every federal appeals court in the country over the next two years. That all depends on time and retirements of current judges. And as for the nation's highest court, former President Donald Trump cemented a conservative supermajority on the Supreme Court, one that's already frustrated Biden's agenda on reproductive rights, climate change and gun safety measures.",

And because Democrats held the Senate in last year's elections, there's a chance the Senate will confirm even more of Biden's nominees.

            "article_content": "Former President Trump will be arraigned Tuesday in a New York City courtroom. Trump is trying to capitalize on the event and raise campaign money. Wisconsin's Supreme Court election is Tuesday.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: The mayor of New York City has a message for people descending on his city to protest. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ERIC ADAMS: Control yourselves. New York City is our home, not a playground for your misplaced anger. A MART\u00cdNEZ, HOST: Eric Adams spoke as Donald Trump prepares for a court appearance on his indictment. The former president is back in the center of public attention. He spent the night in his Manhattan apartment and heads downtown to likely have his fingerprints taken today. In a way, New Yorkers know this drill. Presidents often visit the city, and their motorcades stop traffic. In this case, police will close several streets for the movements of the former president. INSKEEP: Andrea Bernstein joins us now from outside the Manhattan Criminal Court. She beat the traffic and is there (laughter) at a ridiculously early hour. Andrea, good morning. ANDREA BERNSTEIN, BYLINE: Good morning, Steve. INSKEEP: OK, this court proceeding is not until the afternoon. You're there, like, in the dark. You're there really, really early. I mean, what's it like there? Do people have coffee? Do people have bagels? What's going on? BERNSTEIN: Oh, yeah. So mostly what there is here is a lot of media. People began lining up yesterday in the middle of the afternoon - reporters - in order to be able to get onto another line this morning for press access to the courtroom. It's just a sign of how unusual, unprecedented this event is, that there are no rules, no guidance. Normally, all of this stuff is secret until the indictment is unsealed. So we do know there is an indictment. And as a result, reporters are here, but no protesters, nobody else. Other than that, there's security. But it feels quite calm here in lower Manhattan. INSKEEP: I'm still just worried about you. Can you get a cup of coffee, anything the next eight hours? BERNSTEIN: Oh, I brought coffee and snacks... INSKEEP: OK, good. BERNSTEIN: ...Due to the unpredictability of how the day will roll out. INSKEEP: OK. So as best you can tell, what is supposed to unfold in the courtroom later today? BERNSTEIN: So we won't be allowed in until the middle of the day. But we are expecting the former president to arrive here sometime in the middle-ish of the day. No precise details have been given. Procedure calls for him to be fingerprinted, processed and eventually walked to the courtroom, which is on the 15th floor of this building. And it's a pretty long hallway down to the courtroom at the end of the hall with Judge Juan Merchan. INSKEEP: OK. And I guess we'll find out the details of this indictment, which, we'll remind people, involve payoffs - hush money to an adult film star, although not strictly the payoffs, but covering up the payoffs. That's the alleged crime here, right? BERNSTEIN: Right. The alleged crime here has to do with the fact that Michael Cohen, Trump's attorney at the time, was reimbursed for the hush money payment with checks that were written out over a year and that were described in the Trump organization's internal systems as legal retainers, which, of course, they were not. And we've known that they were not for years because of the federal court case involving Mr. Cohen. The question is is for each of these 11 checks, are there charges associated with them? One former prosecutor suggested to me that there might be several associated with each check, which could bring us up to a substantial number of charges. But again, we will not know until the indictment is unsealed in the courtroom this afternoon. INSKEEP: What does Trump do after he leaves court? BERNSTEIN: So we understand that he goes back to Mar-a-Lago, which is, again, quite a change of scene from this dilapidated courthouse where he will be appearing today. INSKEEP: OK. He'll have a speech tonight - a primetime speech tonight, we're told. Andrea Bernstein, thanks so much. BERNSTEIN: Thank you. INSKEEP: So that's what we should expect today in New York's courtrooms. Let's turn to the politics. MART\u00cdNEZ: Yeah, Trump's indictment is unique, not just because no former president has ever been indicted, but also because that former president is running to be president again. INSKEEP: So NPR's senior political editor and correspondent Domenico Montanaro is with us. Domenico, good morning. DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Hey, Steve. INSKEEP: Do you have coffee? Because I was already asking Andrea. You're up early as well. You doing OK there? MONTANARO: Of course. Got to have the coffee for doing Up First, right? INSKEEP: OK, good. That's exactly right. OK, so how is this affecting Donald Trump? MONTANARO: Well, look, you know, we've seen this show before with Trump. You know, he's impeached twice. It didn't really change anything. Not much moves the needle really when it comes to Trump's base. And he's trying to capitalize here. He's been raising money off of this. His campaign says Trump has raised more than $7 million in the few days after the indictment. He's predictably making a pretty big show of it. You know, he's - he is fighting a media request to have a camera in the courtroom because we know Trump in front of a crowd is much different than Trump at a court proceeding. But he is scheduled to speak later tonight, as you said. And most lawyers, you know, will tell their clients to stay quiet. Don't say anything that could hurt the case. That's not Trump. This is what he does. And let me read to you from my dog-eared copy of Trump's \"Art Of The Deal.\" And it says, from a bottom-line business perspective, bad publicity is sometimes better than no publicity at all. INSKEEP: (Laughter) Not a maxim he invented. Many people have said that. But he follows it, it would seem. How are Republicans reacting to this bad publicity? MONTANARO: It's really put them in a box. You know, Trump has really gotten them to line up lockstep behind him. Republicans on Capitol Hill mostly blasted this New York prosecutor. They're echoing Trump's language that this is politically motivated. Now, it's not everyone in the Republican Party. We've seen a thin slice speak out against Trump, but very few. You know, we had one new candidate get in the race who denounced Trump - former Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson. He says the criminal investigations against Trump, when taken together, are very serious and that Trump should not be running. Here he is talking to ABC News. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"THIS WEEK WITH GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS\") ASA HUTCHINSON: Those are three very serious investigations. You might say one of them doesn't showcase anything. But when you look at all three of them combined, it should give Americans pause. MONTANARO: You know, but he's pretty few and far between in the Republican Party. You know, these are three entities conducting four investigations - you know, this one in New York, two by the federal government, one in Georgia related to Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election. But take this for context about how Trump is doing with Republicans. Sarah Longwell is a Republican pollster. She runs these focus groups of Republican voters, and she found, for the first time this past week, that no one in the focus group said that they would vote for DeSantis - Florida Governor Ron DeSantis - over Trump. So Trump really does appear to be strengthening his grip on the base. INSKEEP: That is a wow, since we've heard so many Trump voters who have said, I love the former president, but we need to move on. We need somebody fresh. Now they're back on Trump. MONTANARO: Definitely. And, you know, look, the fact is here that he is really been able to take some of these investigations that he's called witch hunts and, you know, use them to be able to strengthen his grip on the Republican base. But, you know, with independents and Democrats, it's a totally different story. We're seeing this very unique sort of American political divergence where you have 8 in 10 Republicans say they like Trump, three-quarters of Republicans say that he should be president again. But 6 in 10 people overall say that he should not be. You know, and on the trail, Trump's Republican rivals - really not using this as an opportunity. It could be one for a skilled and talented politician who can make the argument, but we haven't seen that emerge yet. INSKEEP: NPR's Domenico Montanaro, thanks so much. MONTANARO: You're welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) INSKEEP: Wisconsin voters decide today who they want to control the state Supreme Court. MART\u00cdNEZ: There are seven justices on that court who make big decisions for the state. Just like in the Supreme Court, they are ideologically divided. And the election of one seat will decide who gets to referee big issues in a presidential swing state. INSKEEP: Wisconsin Public Radio's political reporter Shawn Johnson is covering this. Shawn, good morning. SHAWN JOHNSON, BYLINE: Hi, Steve. INSKEEP: So is this essentially a battle between Republicans and Democrats then? JOHNSON: So technically, no. These are officially nonpartisan seats, but they are very partisan. On the Democratic side, you have Milwaukee County Judge Janet Protasiewicz. She's been very outspoken about her personal beliefs in this campaign. On the Republican side, you have former state Supreme Court Justice Dan Kelly. He has shared less about himself, says he wants to be a boring justice on the court. But his Republican resume is very long. INSKEEP: And we have three liberals, three conservatives and this one seat open in the middle. What are the big issues that this judge could be the swing vote on? JOHNSON: At the top of the list, I think, is abortion. When the U.S. Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade last year, Wisconsin's pre-Civil War abortion ban went back into effect. If Protasiewicz wins, the court could also hear a case on redistricting that challenges the state's Republican-drawn legislative and congressional maps. INSKEEP: Oh, yeah. JOHNSON: And, of course, whoever's in control of this court will hear lawsuits about the 2024 election when those are filed. INSKEEP: I think we're getting a picture of why this would be the most expensive state Supreme Court anywhere in the country on record. How much are we talking about at this point? JOHNSON: So the old record for a state Supreme Court race anywhere was $15 million. That was set in Illinois in 2004, according to the Brennan Center for Justice. Brennan says about 29 million has now been spent so far in Wisconsin's race on advertising. Another review of overall spending by the website WisPolitics pegs it at 45 million. So you're looking at two or three times the old record already. INSKEEP: Wow. JOHNSON: As far as candidate fundraising goes, Protasiewicz has far outpaced Kelly with a big assist from the state Democratic Party. But in the closing days of the race, conservative money from outside groups has come in big for Kelly and closed that gap. And those conservative ads have almost all been on the issue of crime, attacking Protasiewicz for sentences she handed down as a Milwaukee County judge. INSKEEP: Shawn, I've heard a critique of judicial elections in the past, essentially that people never really know the candidates. Voters are not that engaged, and a very small group of people or a political faction can get their people in. Is that what's happening here? JOHNSON: I think it's safe to say, at this point in the race, that both sides now realize the importance of this campaign and what's at stake. Conservative activist Bob Dohnal organized a recent get out the vote party for Kelly. He said that if Protasiewicz wins, the court could overturn everything from union laws to voting laws to gun laws. BOB DOHNAL: We know that this - the election is really, really key. There are so many things up for grabs that the courts can throw out. JOHNSON: And on the Democratic side, they view this court race as a chance to finally move Wisconsin's politics to the left. Protasiewicz supporters like Alexandria Delcourt are also highly motivated by the abortion issue. ALEXANDRIA DELCOURT: It's really important for me to have a candidate that is a champion for reproductive rights, reproductive freedom, just because there are so many places now where that's being stripped away so violently. JOHNSON: And you can't really overstate the importance of this race for Wisconsin. A Kelly win would preserve the court's conservative majority probably for another couple of years. A Protasiewicz win would give liberals a majority in the court for the first time in 15 years. INSKEEP: Shawn Johnson of Wisconsin Public Radio, thanks so much. JOHNSON: Thanks, Steve.

            "article_content": "How should U.S history be told, and who gets to tell it? Debate over these questions has raged for years \u2013 but nowhere is it more pronounced right now than in Florida, where Gov. Ron DeSantis and others are waging a battle against history courses that highlight the role of slavery in our nation's past. A key point of conflict: The 1619 Project, the New York Times-led public discourse effort \u2013 and now documentary series on Hulu \u2013 that's been trying to do just that for the past four years.Host Brittany Luse chats with NPR's Giulia Heyward to get the download on Gov. DeSantis' attempts to ban AP African American studies in his state. Then, Brittany sits down with two experts who contributed to The 1619 Project: Dorothy Roberts, a legal scholar and sociologist at the University of Pennsylvania, and Leslie Alexander, a historian at Rutgers University. They make the case that slavery led to some of our biggest political fissures today, and discuss why it's important for all Americans to understand those connections. The interview highlights below are adapted from an episode of It's Been A Minute. Follow us on Apple Podcasts or Spotify, and keep up with us on Twitter. These excerpts have been edited for length and clarity. The fight in Florida against African American studies Brittany Luse: Can you summarize what's been going on with this battle over AP African American studies? Giulia Heyward: In August, roughly 60 schools introduced a pilot course. This would be an AP African American studies course, which high schoolers would be able to take for college credit. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, as well as other education officials, are opposed to the course because they feel as if it teaches a woke indoctrination to students. Florida education officials decided to ban the course, saying that they will not let AP African American studies be taught in high schools in Florida...  It's really about how we as a country contend with some of the uglier parts of our past. Is it something that we shy away from and choose not to discuss in classrooms, or that we only discuss with a specific age group? Or is it something that we embrace and we have those uncomfortable conversations? Reproductive control that is rooted in slavery Dorothy Roberts: In a patriarchal society, children would have the status of their fathers, but they changed it to the rule that would apply to animals. That the status of a piglet, for example, is that of the mother and is owned by the person who owns the mother. And so that allowed for white enslavers to profit from their sexual assaults of Black women. But it also meant that Black women were deemed to give birth to enslavable children. And that idea not only is the foundation of the invention of race in America, but also the beginning of this idea that Black women's childbearing is dangerous. Old ideas that still influence policy Luse: Dorothy, something you said in your essay is that the way that race was developed, as we understand it... was very reliant on policing Black women's reproductive health, reproductive systems, and their sexuality. And it changed forever how Black women's sexuality was viewed and is still viewed today. Tell us more about that. Roberts: The stereotype that Black women are innately unfit to care for their own children, and passing on an unhealthy, antisocial set of behaviors and lifestyles to their children \u2013 those ideas heavily influenced social policy in America to today. For example, the \"welfare queen,\" that Black women had babies just to get a welfare check and then they would spend the money on themselves and neglect their children. That stereotype... was powerful enough to fuel the restructuring of welfare in America. We can look at prison policy. Child welfare policy. The removal of Black children at astronomical rates from their families also promoted by this idea that Black mothers don't really care about their children... So social policy in the United States today that somehow, if not substantially, has a link to the idea that Black women's childbearing and sexuality is a social problem that needs to be fixed, that needs to be policed, that should be the subject of punitive social policies. Fear of rebellion Luse: Leslie, you said that by the 1700s there had been this longstanding fear that enslaved Black people would revolt against their white enslavers. But the successful Haitian uprising of 1791 turned that fear into a reality... What actions did the white men who were in power in what we now call the United States, what actions did they take in response to that?Alexander: Well, what we see is a ramping up of policing. The slave patrols are put on alert. They're also surveilling and ramping up their monitoring of free black communities as well. There's concern that alliances would emerge. And of course in situations where conspiracies are actually revealed, then we see whole new waves of legislation limiting everything from freedom of movement, denying access to education, to implementing new laws that monitor and surveil cultural activities. This is where we start to see drumming disallowed. There's even laws passed saying that dancing is illegal. Expressions or manifestations of black joy present a potential danger to the stability of the institution of slavery. The link between race and fear Luse: We see that process play out over and over throughout American history... You make the argument that white people are not just fearful of black rebellion, they're also fearful of black success or black progress. After reconstruction, we see Black people start to participate in government, holding public office, opening schools, getting educated, starting businesses. And the reaction to that is brutal and swift. That pattern continues on whether it's through Jim Crow, Black codes, and into some of the laws we see today. Why would white people be scared of Black progress? Alexander: Ah, this is a really complicated question, but I think it's a really important one. I think white people believe that they have a lot more to lose than they actually do. But I think their fear is that they lose control... They'll have to reckon with how poor white people are treated. One of the ways white elites have historically been able to keep poor white people in check is to basically tell them, \"It doesn't matter how poor you are, it doesn't matter how much the policies that we've created cause you to suffer and struggle. At least you're not Black.\" If you remove racism, there's actually then going to have to be a reckoning. And so from the perspective of a white elite person, then the whole system gets upended. And from their perspective, they then lose everything. But of course, from my perspective, what that means is that then everybody else gets to win.

            "article_content": "A federal appeals court has preserved access to the abortion pill mifepristone but under tighter rules. Calls mount for Sen. Feinstein to resign. Brazil's Lula in China to press for peace in Ukraine.  LEILA FADEL, HOST: Two of three judges on a federal appeals court are now the ones deciding how patients can get an abortion drug. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: The judges answered an appeal to keep it available. As we have reported, a single federal judge decided the Food and Drug Administration improperly authorized mifepristone two decades ago. Now a three-judge panel has made its own judgment. All three judges blocked the ruling, which means mifepristone remains available, but two of three voted to uphold some restrictions on how it is distributed. FADEL: NPR's Sarah McCammon has been covering this and joins us now to explain what this all means. Hi, Sarah. SARAH MCCAMMON, BYLINE: Good morning. FADEL: Good morning. So what does the decision say? MCCAMMON: Well, just as a reminder, you know, this all started because a conservative-leaning federal judge in Texas named Matthew Kacsmaryk had ordered the abortion drug mifepristone essentially to be taken off the market starting tomorrow. FADEL: Yeah. MCCAMMON: Now, the Biden administration appealed that right away. And in the meantime, the Department of Justice asked the Fifth Circuit appeals court for an emergency stay that would put Kacsmaryk's whole decision on hold while this case plays out. And that would allow patients to keep getting this drug, you know, which is a key part of the standard protocol for abortions - for medication abortions in the U.S. And it's used, by many estimates, in more than half of abortions now. So anti-abortion groups, of course, are challenging the Food and Drug Administration approval of mifepristone and some of the rule changes that FDA has made since then. Leila, what the Fifth Circuit did overnight is to grant part of the Biden administration request for a stay. So the FDA approval stays in place, but the court essentially has rolled back some of the rule changes in recent years that had expanded access to the drug. FADEL: OK, so what does that practically mean for people who want to access this medication? What's changing? What's not? MCCAMMON: Right. Well, this court, which also has a reputation for being a very conservative court, by the way, said that the statute of limitations has passed to challenge the original FDA approval of the drug back in 2000, but they said that more recent rule changes could be considered. So at least right now, the court is doing away with a couple of key changes. FADEL: OK. MCCAMMON: One is the drug was originally approved for use up to seven weeks of pregnancy. Then the FDA expanded that to 10 weeks in 2016. This ruling just sets that back to seven weeks. And that's potentially a big deal because many people don't know they're pregnant that early on. Those three weeks can make a big difference. And, you know, already, Leila, some doctors prescribe a little past 10 weeks. So it's unclear what this might mean for, you know, off-label prescription, but that's what the court is saying. The court's also saying that these pills can no longer be sent in the mail. And that's significant because, you know, mifepristone is subject to a lot of additional restrictions above and beyond typical prescription drugs, and one thing that Biden administration had done in 2021 was to make permanent a rule change that had kind of started during the pandemic, allowing these drugs to be sent through the mail for people who consult with doctors over telehealth. This decision does away with that, too. And, you know, I should mention that all of this is being appealed. Ultimately, where this all lands is unclear. But that's where things stand right now. FADEL: And just really briefly, if you could talk about the on-the-ground impact, then, of this decision. MCCAMMON: You know, it's early, but I anticipate a lot of continued concern from abortion rights groups. I mean, this does preserve some access. As I said, it rolls back some existing access. And also, you know, one thing I noticed is the court in its decision mentions the idea of Comstock laws, which are 19th century laws that restrict the mailing of materials, including things used in abortion. The Biden administration has said those don't apply to mailing abortion pills, but the court seemed favorable to that argument. And so that's really something to watch because it could have a big impact on other types of reproductive health care. FADEL: NPR's Sarah McCammon. Thanks so much, Sarah. MCCAMMON: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) FADEL: California Senator Dianne Feinstein says she will step back but not down. INSKEEP: Feinstein is asking to temporarily drop one of her most important jobs in the Senate. She is part of the Judiciary Committee, which has been confirming judges appointed by President Biden. She hasn't been able to do that job recently due to illness. She has also missed dozens of Senate votes this year, prompting some fellow Democrats to say the 89-year-old should resign. She has a bit less than two years left in her term. FADEL: NPR's congressional correspondent Claudia Grisales is with us for more. Let's start with the senator's extended leave from the Senate. How did this all start? CLAUDIA GRISALES, BYLINE: Right. The senator said last night she was diagnosed with a case of shingles that she thought would allow her to return to Washington by the end of last month. But she's had complications, and as a result, she's missed most of this year's votes in the Senate, a little more than a month, and we do not know when she'll return. FADEL: And now she's facing increased calls from Democrats for her resignation. What's next for this seat? GRISALES: Right. She already announced she would not run for reelection in 2024. With that, she said she planned to finish her final two years strong, following this 30-plus-year career in the Senate. For now, she's defending this absence, saying she'll return as soon as her medical team says it's safe. But she's not signaling she has any plans to step down early, which puts a key seat and a narrow Senate Democratic majority in limbo. FADEL: Now, Feinstein is facing all of this criticism in part because she sits on an important committee. The Senate Judiciary Committee, in her absence, has held up the panel's work, it appears. So she's asking to be temporarily relieved from that committee. What does that mean? GRISALES: So she said in her statement she understands these concerns tied to the Judiciary Committee, and she's asked Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer to allow another Democratic senator to serve on that panel instead. Schumer's office said he'll agree to the request, and he'll ask the Senate when they return next week to replace her temporarily. And this is critical because the panel, which is led by Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin, who took over this role from Feinstein, has a long to-do list. This includes plans to confirm more judges and a hearing on new ethical questions surrounding the Supreme Court after a report that Justice Clarence Thomas accepted gifts of travel from a wealthy GOP donor, plus questions over whether the panel could play a role in this new national fight over access to the abortion drug. FADEL: Will these moves appease her critics? GRISALES: That's hard to say. We're seeing some now openly call for her resignation. This was largely led by California Democrat Ro Khanna last night. Before Feinstein issued her statement on this extended absence, Khanna said it was time for her resignation, and it's, quote, \"time to put country ahead of personal loyalty.\" FADEL: Right. This is clearly exposing divisiveness, an ugly fight for Democrats. GRISALES: Yes. Khanna said that while Feinstein has had, quote, \"a lifetime of public service, it's obvious she can no longer fulfill her duties\" and that not speaking out undermines his and other members' credibility. So far, at least one other House Democrat, Dean Phillips of Minnesota, echoed this, saying it's a dereliction of duty for Feinstein to remain in the Senate under these conditions and for others not to speak out about it. And we should note, if Feinstein were to step down early, that would give the California governor a chance to shake up an already very competitive race for her seat by installing his own appointee ahead of the 2024 election. FADEL: NPR's Claudia Grisales. Thank you so much. GRISALES: Thank you much. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) FADEL: Brazil's president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, is in China this week. INSKEEP: He expects to meet China's president, and this visit underlines China's influence in South America. China has invested in many countries in that continent, as it has in other places, and it's a big trading partner for Brazil. FADEL: NPR's South America correspondent Carrie Kahn is in Rio de Janeiro and joins us now. Good morning, Carrie. CARRIE KAHN, BYLINE: Good morning. FADEL: So, I mean, there's been a lot of talk about China's global role - mediating a deal with Saudi and Iran, hosting world leaders and questions about what it means for its role on the global stage. If you could just talk about this visit by Brazil's leader and what he's hoping to do while in China. KAHN: Well, he has a big agenda there for the next couple days. It seems like he's brought half the government with him, ministers, governors, dozens of business people, because, overall - you talked about the global politics of it all - this is a visit about trade for him. Look; 40% of Brazil's exports go to China. That's a lot of beef and soy. China is Brazil's No. 1 trading partner. The U.S. is a distant second. I was talking about the trip to Rodrigo Zeidan. He's a Brazilian economics professor at NYU in Shanghai. He said he gets that the trip is coming at a time of heightened tensions between the U.S. and China, but not everything is about the U.S. RODRIGO ZEIDAN: It's not about any message to the U.S. It's really about realpolitik between two very important trade and investment partners. KAHN: And that's especially since Brazil's relationship with China deteriorated under the previous far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro. He frequently insulted the Chinese. Lula pledged to bring Brazil back to the world stage. FADEL: Now, what's on the itinerary for Lula in China? I'm assuming he's meeting with Xi Jinping? KAHN: Yes, they'll meet on Friday. Brazil and China are also part of the so-called BRICS with Russia, India and South Africa, this Global South alliance that says it's a counterbalance to the West. Lula spoke today at the BRICS Development Bank, where he railed against the fact that all trade transactions are in dollars. He wants that to change with China to their local currency. Lula also really wants China to join him in this plan of his to be a mediator in the Ukraine war. Lula talks about building this peace club of nations to broker an end to the war. You know, he is an elder leftist and espouses Brazil's nonaligned global status, which, he says, a perfect, neutral player in the politics of all. Lula's stand just irks the West, since he never outright condemns Russia's invasion of Ukraine. He refuses to sell ammunition to Ukraine, too. And he just sent his foreign policy adviser to meet with Putin. FADEL: Well, does Lula have the clout, though, to pull something like that off? I mean, is Brazil a big enough player in the world today to take on that role? KAHN: Well, when I talk to analysts here in Brazil, they say, no, Lula is punching above his weight. But last time he was president in the late 2000s, he worked on a nuclear deal with Iran. I was talking with Oliver Stuenkel. He's an international relations professor at Brazil's FGV University. And he said Lula should just stay closer to home and work on things like the environment, not waste the goodwill he already has around the world. OLIVER STUENKEL: Everybody wants to be friends with Brazil because Brazil is an environmental superpower. But it's not like everybody will eternally sort of support Lula on the foreign policy front. KAHN: Lula is in the midst of an interesting balancing act with China and with the U.S. And he's very cognizant of China's growing footprint in Latin America and how that worries the U.S., too. FADEL: NPR's South America correspondent Carrie Kahn in Rio de Janeiro. Thank you so much for your reporting, Carrie. KAHN: You're welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) FADEL: Before you go, we wanted to bring you another story making headlines today. The Washington Post has new information on the leaker of the classified Pentagon documents that mentioned countries all over the world, including battlefield details on Ukraine. Shane Harris is one of The Washington Post reporters who broke that story and interviewed on camera a friend of that leaker. They were in the same gamer group on the online platform Discord, where the leaker went by the pseudonym OG. Here's the friend, who agreed to be recorded by The Washington Post. The person is a minor and spoke on the condition of anonymity and with permission from his parents. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: I want to keep OG's identity secret because I still care for him like he's a family member. He's not a Russian operative. He's not a Ukrainian operative. FADEL: Shane Harris joins us now to talk about this reporting. Hi, Shane. SHANE HARRIS: Hi. Good morning. FADEL: So what did he tell you about the person who shared these documents? HARRIS: This person who he calls OG - and he said he and another person we spoke to as a member of the group do know the identity, the name and the location of the person, but they won't reveal it - described him as the kind of leader of this group that formed on this Discord server at the beginning of the pandemic. And they kind of all stuck together while they were in isolation. Said he's a younger person in his early 20s, that he works at a military base and that the nature of his job gave him access to these highly classified documents that they understood he was bringing home from work and then sharing with people in the Discord server. They also indicated that he had worked some of the time in his job in, as they kind of described it, a secure facility where this information could be accessed. We would know this as something called a SCIF. It would be something that you might see in a government installation that would kind of be like a secured room or area where someone could access classified information. FADEL: Shane Harris is one of The Washington Post reporters who broke that story, and he talks to MORNING EDITION about the findings.

            "article_content": "Republicans in the North Carolina House now have a supermajority after Rep. Tricia Cotham switched from the Democratic party to the GOP.  ADRIAN FLORIDO, HOST: North Carolina politics got a big shake-up today. A longtime Democratic member of the state House of Representatives announced that she is becoming a Republican. Her switch gives the GOP supermajorities in both chambers of the legislature, allowing the party to override vetoes of Democratic Governor Roy Cooper. And it unleashed a firestorm of criticism from Democrats who called for her to resign. Steve Harrison from member station WFAE has this report. STEVE HARRISON, BYLINE: Tricia Cotham had been one of the most well-known Democratic politicians in Mecklenburg County, home to Charlotte, the state's largest city. But on Wednesday morning, Cotham was at the headquarters of the North Carolina Republican Party in Raleigh. In announcing her defection, she blasted other Democrats as close-minded bullies. She said that when she worked with Republicans earlier this year... (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRICIA COTHAM: I was considered a traitor, I was told, a spy. Please don't come to caucus. You'll tell everything we know. That is a terrible mentality, and that's just wrong. HARRISON: Cotham is joining a Republican Party that's firmly entrenched in power in North Carolina with no signs of losing it. While Democrats in last year's midterm election did better than expected nationally, in North Carolina, Republicans won a U.S. Senate seat, added to their majority in the state legislature and swept statewide judicial races. And with Cotham's move, North Carolina Republicans have even more power. Democratic state party chair Anderson Clayton led a rally after the news broke. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ANDERSON CLAYTON: Representative Cotham's decision to switch parties is a deceit of the highest order. It is a betrayal to the people of Mecklenburg County. Reproductive freedoms are on the line. Our public schools are on the line. LGBTQ rights are on the line. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Yes. CLAYTON: Voting rights are on the line. HARRISON: The GOP has enough members in the legislature to override Democratic Governor Roy Cooper's vetoes. That means they could place new limits on abortion, which is now legal at 20 weeks. North Carolina is a destination for many women across the South, where states have severely restricted abortions in the past year. Ten years ago, Cotham stunned lawmakers when she announced on the House floor that she had previously had an abortion for medical reasons and is now downplaying what her party's switch might mean for abortion access in the state. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) COTHAM: I believe women are much more. We're business owners. We help create economies. We raise families. We carry it all. And so to always be tried just for that tragic, hard topic is wrong. HARRISON: When Cotham campaigned last fall, she ran on LGBT and abortion rights in a blue district that President Biden won easily. Now, the state's House Democratic leader called on Cotham to resign, and one advocacy group called her turncoat Tricia. For NPR News, I'm Steve Harrison in Raleigh. Copyright \u00a9 2023 NPR.

            "article_content": "Bella DuBalle describes her drag persona as a combination of Miss Piggy, Dolly Parton and Mr. Rogers.\n                \n                    \n                    Bella DuBalle\n                    \n                \nhide caption Bella DuBalle describes her drag persona as a combination of Miss Piggy, Dolly Parton and Mr. Rogers. Tennessee's new law criminalizing public drag performances goes into effect April 1. The law, which refers to \"male or female impersonators who provide entertainment that appeals to a prurient interest,\" makes it an offense for a person to engage in an adult cabaret performance on public property \u2014 or in a location where the performance could be viewed by children. The first offense for violating the law is a misdemeanor, with a fine up to $2,500 and/or up to 12 months in jail. Subsequent violations could be felonies, punishable by up to 6 years in prison. Tennessee native Bella DuBalle is an ordained minister and also the show director and host at Atomic Rose, the largest drag club in Memphis. She says the Tennessee law was written by legislators who don't understand what drag is. \"The idea that they think that every drag performer is doing something hypersexual or obscene obviously means they don't know very much about it,\" DuBalle says. \"I cannot succinctly put into words what the entire art of drag is, and the fact that these legislators who know far less about the art than I do and have never been to a drag show are sitting out there making these laws \u2014 that's a little upsetting.\" DuBalle points out that law's vague language \u2014 particularly the reference to \"male and female impersonators\" \u2014 could be misused to target trans, gender non-conforming or non-binary people. \"As a non-binary person who wears clothing that does not necessarily match the gender that I was assigned at birth, I am fearful that ... someone's going to see me in Kroeger in a dress and call the cops and say, 'This person's being obscene in front of my kids,'\" DuBalle says. DuBalle says she's always seen drag as a political act, but now the stakes are much higher. Since speaking out against the Tennessee law she's received threats of violence and even death. Nevertheless, she's committed to standing her ground. She's vowed that Atomic Rose will continue all its shows \u2014 including its all-ages brunch \u2014 even after the ban goes into effect. \"I will not cow to intimidation and I won't be silenced,\" she says. \"If somebody takes it upon themselves to silence my voice, there are many, many others to take my place. Queer voices will never be silenced.\" On her drag persona, which is part Miss Piggy, part Dolly Parton and part Mr. Rogers Miss Piggy, I think, is the big costumes, the \"I am a movie star. Every room I walk into the story is about me.\" That's the full fantasy of drag. For Dolly Parton, it's big, flashy costumes and the fact that you can continue to be a genuine and sweet Southern person and still be successful. And then for me, Mr. Rogers is probably the most important, and that's about just recognizing each person's humanity, and hopefully letting them see themselves in something that you do and to show them that no matter how different we all are, we're actually a whole lot more similar. On everyone being in drag in their own way It's really freeing to understand that you're not married to the shell, the aesthetic, the things that people see. We're so much more than our body. Bella DuBalle You get up in the morning and you decide what you want to put on based on how you want the world to perceive you. What I'm going to wear for a lazy day at home cleaning is very different than what I'm going to wear if I'm going to a wedding or a funeral, and that's very different than what I'm going to wear if I'm going out on a Saturday night clubbing with friends. You change your exterior based on what you want the world to perceive you as. That's all drag is. And for me, when you can look at this creation that I made on stage and say, \"Wow, that's not really who that person is. This illusion that I'm seeing is not who that person is,\" my hope is that then the light bulb goes off and you realize, \"Wow, this illusion I'm presenting is not really who I am.\" And it's really freeing to understand that you're not married to the shell, the aesthetic, the things that people see. We're so much more than our body. On how the new law affects the club and her personally If the law stands as it is and is enforced the way that they would like it to be, then we would not be able to welcome people under the age of 18 into our all-ages brunch. If it stands that they will not allow any drag being classified as adult cabaret here in public, that means no drag performers in the Pride Parade and festival. I, as a minister, have been asked to marry couples in public in drag. I don't know if that would be legal anymore, if my religious freedom supersedes this law or if it would be infringed upon. ... Amazing defiant speech from Bella Duball in Tennessee against the anti drag bill there.\u201cIf they try to take drag away, this year we will remind them we will fight for our liberation. We will raise our bricks high.\u201d pic.twitter.com/Tnst4GuOaZ I get ready here at home and then I go to the venue. So I'm worried [in] the small amount of time that I'm walking from the parking garage to the venue, is that public? Our venue has large windows and we're off of Beale Street. If there are people walking by with their kids and they glance through the windows, is that now being viewed by a minor, despite the fact that they're looking through the windows into our private establishment? So for me, again, there's just some really, really vague terminology, and that's where most of my fear and confusion lies. On what happens if the club closes That is my livelihood. And all these people who are like, \"Well, you shouldn't have that as a job. You shouldn't be around kids!\" It's my supreme joy to tell them, \"[If I] have to quit doing drag, I'm going to go back to my old job \u2014 teaching. So you if you don't want to me around your kids, I got really bad news for you!\" ... I'm a founding member of the Tennessee Shakespeare Company, and so I've been to almost all of the schools here in the mid-South to teach Shakespeare. It was through Shakespeare that I first came to drag. I got paid really good money by the National Endowment for the Arts and the state of Tennessee to go into all these schools and play drag roles in front of their students. It was OK then, but it's not OK now. On performing for and reading to children I think most kids are so taken with the aesthetic, if they're young enough, most of them just think I'm a Disney princess. People ask sometimes, \"How do you explain drag to kids?\" And I'm like, \"You don't have to!\" They're the originators of drag. Kids came up with playing dress up. They understand it way better than the rest of us. Some of us just never quit playing. I have [books] that I love. A couple of my favorites are Red: A Crayon Story, and it's about a blue crayon that has a red label, and trying to find their way and being told that this is what you are, despite the fact that they know their color is different. There's one called Auntie Uncle: Drag Queen Hero. That's about a young child's uncle who is also a drag performer. And how they reconcile the uncle and the aunt's existence in one person. And then I love My Shadow is Purple. It's about the world in which everyone seems to have a blue or a pink shadow, but my shadow is purple. As a minister, I read the Bible cover to cover, and that book is full of rape and murder and incest, and I would never read it to a kid. But what do I know? I'm just a drag queen. Bella DuBalle So they're usually books about self-acceptance, about knowing that there are other people who might be made differently than you, and your job is only to love and accept what they tell you. As a minister, I read the Bible cover to cover, and that book is full of rape and murder and incest, and I would never read it to a kid. But what do I know? I'm just a drag queen. Most of the books that I pick are going to be very, very Mr. Rogers encouragement-style. On when straight men do drag, it makes a joke of femininity When a straight person does it, it's a joke. ... When I put on a dress, it is a statement of strength. It is a statement of how powerful my femininity is. So for me, I think it's about the way that we approach the feminine. The patriarchy has always used drag as another way to reinforce that women are weaker. I think we, as the queer community, actually champion that pride or that femininity. We're very proud of something that other people are deeply ashamed of. On Gov. Bill Lee's 1977 yearbook photo of him in drag at a powder-puff football game surfacing Here in the South, we have these old fundraisers that have been going on for decades, and one of them is powder-puff football, where the boys dress as cheerleaders and the girls dress as football players. ... So this is very, very old style Southern entertainment. And when I questioned the governor about being in drag ... he said, \"That's ridiculous that you would conflate something like that to sexual entertainment in front of children.\" And I completely agree. They're not the same thing. But he does not agree that he signed a law that makes no such distinction. The law does not draw any distinctions between a school fundraiser or theater or opera ballet, wrestling cosplay, people dressing up for Halloween. It's so vague.   And that was the real hypocrisy. It was not that he'd been in a dress, it was that he didn't realize that what he was doing was just as innocent as what I do. On this legislation being \"legal bullying\" RuPaul said they are a bunch of bullies making these laws. It causes a lot of big feelings when you see someone love in themselves something that you hate in yourself. I think when you see someone else who is proud of a part of themselves that you have been taught to be ashamed of \u2014 that causes people to lash out. \"How dare you not be ashamed of this thing that I have been taught to be ashamed of, of this thing that I know as shameful?\" And to me, that's a big cause of why we're seeing these legislations passed. On praying for the lawmakers who created the ban I have never known the freedom of spirit and the liberty of heart that I know now in my life. And all I want is for every other person to experience that same joy, to be so unabashedly proud of who they are, that they live without fear and they don't allow other people's opinions to hold them back. I know that if other people's hearts were opened in that same way, they wouldn't be concerned with trying to legislate other people's love. They wouldn't be concerned with trying to dictate what other people do with their lives because they'd be so busy enjoying their own. On what she dreamed about as a farm kid in rural Tennessee I think I always dreamed of making the world a little bit better than how I found it. I always hoped that there would be some moment that would come along that would provide me a sense of purpose that I was supposed to be here, and that I made a difference by being here. ... I will be 43 in just a few weeks, and this is the first time in my life that I've had a true sense of purpose. Audio interview produced and edited by: Seth Kelley and Susan Nyakundi.

            "article_content": "Public health professor Arline Geronimus says marginalized people suffer nearly constant stress, which leads to increasingly serious health problems over time.\n                \n                    \n                    Jon Cherry/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Public health professor Arline Geronimus says marginalized people suffer nearly constant stress, which leads to increasingly serious health problems over time. In 2020, the overall life expectancy in the U.S. dropped by 1.5 years, largely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. But the reduction wasn't shared equally among the general population;  Native American people lost an average of 4.5 years of life expectancy; Black and Hispanic people lost, on average, 3 years, while white people lost only 1.2 years. This figure tracks with other health trends: In general, Black and Hispanic people and those living in poverty in the U.S. have worse health outcomes \u2014 more high blood pressure, higher rates of diabetes and increased  maternal and infant mortality \u2014 than the overall population. Public health researcher Arline Geronimus from the University of Michigan says the traditional belief that the disparities are due to genetics, diet and exercise don't explain data that's accumulated over the years. Instead, she makes the case that marginalized people suffer nearly constant stress from living with poverty and discrimination, which damages their bodies at the cellular level and leads to increasingly serious health problems over time. Geronimus coined a term for this chronic stress \u2014 she calls it \"weathering,\" which, she says, \"literally wears down your heart, your arteries, your neuroendocrine systems, ... all your body systems so that in effect, you become chronologically old at a young age.\" She writes about the phenomenon in her new book, Weathering: The Extraordinary Stress of Ordinary Life in an Unjust Society. Geronimus' theories drew criticism when she first promoted them in the 1990s. But in recent years, her work has generated a wealth of support. She says weathering helps explain why Black women who give birth in their 20s have more complications than those who become mothers in their teens. The older women had endured the stress of their difficult living conditions longer, she says, and thus had suffered more damage to their health. \"It's not that every Black person has more damage than every white person,\" she says. \"It's really about how much stress versus social support you get in your everyday life. ... Because African Americans and low-income Americans are more likely to suffer more of these stressors, they are more likely to be weathered, weathered severely and weathered at younger ages.\" On how the body's natural stress response can lead to weathering Human bodies have evolved, and the reason we haven't gone extinct yet is because when we're faced with an acute, life-threatening challenge, our body automatically activates this release of hormones. And what those hormones do as they flood your body is they increase your heart rate. They increase your breathing rate. They propel oxygenated blood to your large muscles quickly. ... They galvanize fats and sugars from your storage areas of your body into the bloodstream to provide energy towards that ability to fight or flee. ... That process, when you're fighting or running from the cheetah, is a wonderful adaptive process that is designed to last about three minutes. ... The problem in the modern world is ... a lot of [stress] is simply everyday life: Coming home after night shift work and having to stay wide awake and vigilant so you don't forget to get off your bus for the next bus to go home. Trying to get your kids up for school at five in the morning so you can also get to work. ... This means that the stress hormones are chronically flooding your body. The fats and sugars that you catapulted into your bloodstream for energy are constantly flooding your body. It means your heart rate is up, [and] like any other over-exercised muscle, you'll start to get an enlarged heart. You'll start to get hypertension from pushing so much blood through certain arteries and veins to get your heart rate going and your breathing going. If you were pregnant, you might lose your baby, because it's actually probably more adaptive if you're in fight or flight to not be carrying a baby. But even if you don't lose the baby, you'll shunt nutrients away from it because they can't be spent on the growing baby. And so your baby may be born low birth weight or growth retarded because it hasn't been well nourished in the womb. On why middle- and upper-class \"stress\" isn't the same [More affluent people] can take vacations. They can hire people to do their housework or even order their food to be delivered. It's not a relentless day in, day out. They still have many choices. They still have time to relax. They're not dealing with the stereotypical racism aspect that also can activate this process. So the problem is \"stress\" is this very diffuse term. And we think of it as something you can just meditate your way out of or take a vacation or a break. Many people in our country can't even take a break during working hours. On improving maternal mortality rate Maternal mortality still keeps going up. ... But I think more and more people are understanding that systematic racism in the medical care system is part of the problem. There are ways around it, whether those ways are having birth attendants who are doulas or midwives, rather than physicians; having your birth at home. Ways where you will be less stressed during and feel safer during the birth can make a difference. But at this point we don't have enough midwives or doulas or maternity-care providers at all. We have about one maternity-care provider per 15,000 births, and that's not spread evenly over the country.  ... So we also have to do things that get more people trained, and trained not just as OB-GYNs but as midwives and doulas. On studying why Latin American immigrants, such as those from Mexico, have worsening health the longer they're in the U.S. You're a fish out of water. If you've been raised in an immigrant family from Mexico, and then you're moving into predominantly white, American, affluent and well-educated communities and institutions, ... where you don't share the same assumptions or background, where the people you're working with don't appreciate all you've been through, where you're having to always be on your guard and manage how you portray yourself or present yourself to try and not fulfill stereotypes that you think people you're working with or going to school with might have about you. .... And that means you're at a certain level of vigilance and looking for cues everywhere of whether you belong, whether you're welcome, whether you're going to be subject to what many people call microaggressions. ... Those experiences themselves can cause weathering. On how social mobility of minorities doesn't mean less stress [Our health is] an indicator of ... the context that we live in, of a society that is racist, oppressive, class conscious. ... We won't solve health inequalities between Blacks and whites or Latinx and whites or other groups simply by getting people more education or higher incomes. This chronic stress arousal is more likely in those kinds of unsupportive environments than ... the more supportive environments, if you stick with your own group. Weathering is not against social mobility, it's not for segregation, it's for non-erasure. It's for seeing and recognizing what is really happening, and what it does to you biologically, and realizing if we want to eliminate health disparities or promote health equity, we have to attend to what's happening in these different settings.

            "article_content": "The legal battle over abortion access continues, this time over the drug mifestone; also some Democrats call for Senator Dianne Feinstein to step down amid on-going health issues.  AYESHA RASCOE, HOST: Abortion-rights supporters rallied yesterday across the country and here in Washington in front of the Supreme Court. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Are we going to back down? UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE: No. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Are we going to be quiet? UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE: No. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Are we going to back down ever? UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE: No. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: There we go. RASCOE: The clock is ticking down on a temporary stay of a lower court ruling that would restrict access to the abortion drug mifepristone. The stay was issued by Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito at the request of the Justice Department. It only lasts through this Wednesday. Joining me to discuss this and other political stories this week is NPR White House correspondent Asma Khalid. Hi, Asma. ASMA KHALID, BYLINE: Hi. Good to be with you. RASCOE: OK, so this stay is buying time, but for what exactly? KHALID: Well, I should be clear, it's a purely administrative move. So, you know, folks shouldn't interpret it as a sign of how the Supreme Court might actually decide this case. A bit of backstory, I think, is worthwhile to just explain the context here. So earlier this month, a federal judge in Texas suspended the FDA's approval of the drug. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals stepped in. It preserved some access, but also put new limitations. And then on Friday, the Justice Department issued a formal request to block the limits. And the administration's argument here is that what the court did is not just unprecedented, but it could unleash regulatory chaos. It pointed out that the drug is not just for abortion, but it's also used in many cases to treat miscarriages. This stay that the Supreme Court issued really gives the other side now a chance to respond to the government's appeal. RASCOE: So that's the legal fallout. But there seems to be some political fallout, too, of course, so - over this uncertainty around abortion. KHALID: That's right. I mean, if you look at public opinion, it is becoming, I think, increasingly clear that the courts are not in sync with where people are on this issue. You know, the Pew Research Center has polling out that shows by more than a 2-to-1 margin, Americans say medication abortion ought to be legal in their state. And I will say, you know, what, to me, was very interesting is when the court decision out of Texas came down, when that judge's decision came down, you did not see a slew of Republicans, specifically those running for president in 2024, you know, coming in to champion this decision. But you did immediately see Democrats condemning it. They feel they have the upper hand politically. I will sort of assume that they are likely to run on this issue, as we saw them do in the midterms. And really, the message we're hearing from Democrats is that Republicans are preparing for a national ban on abortion. RASCOE: So what's the president been saying about all of this? KHALID: Well, Biden himself, you know, I will say broadly has not been terribly vocal on abortion, but he has strongly criticized this decision. It is actually the vice president, Kamala Harris, though, who's taken the lead within this administration on promoting reproductive rights. And this is, I think, in many ways a natural issue for her in a way that perhaps it is not for President Biden. Just yesterday, she spoke to hundreds of people who had been marching through downtown LA to voice their support for abortion rights. She warned of so-called extremist leaders around the country and said that this is a really critical point in our nation's history that is going to require people to stand up and fight. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: When you attack the rights of women in America, you are attacking America. KHALID: You know, she is going to keep using the power of the bully pulpit on abortion. And I think this is interesting because there have been questions about the stature of her role on this ticket leading up to the reelection bid. But this is an issue that she's really taken a lead on. She's going to be traveling to Reno, Nev. on Tuesday to discuss the issue. And it's really become central to her job. RASCOE: The Senate returns to Washington this week, but at least one Democratic lawmaker will not be here due to ongoing health problems - Dianne Feinstein of California. She's already planning to retire in 2024, but some of her colleagues are saying she needs to step down now. Here's what Congressman Ro Khanna told NPR just last week. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) RO KHANNA: I have not spoken to Senator Feinstein for four years. She doesn't show up to any of the California lunches. She doesn't engage. I mean, it's sort of an open secret in Washington. All I said is what people know privately - that California has basically had an absentee senator. RASCOE: Asma, what do you make of this? KHALID: I will say it really comes down to the Judiciary Committee. She has a role on that committee. Democrats cannot get any of Biden's picks through and confirmed without her vote. She has offered to temporarily step down from that committee. But it's not clear that, you know, Republicans are going to agree with that move. And that does put the administration in a tight spot. Judges is something they can do through the Senate. They don't need Republican control in the House to do that. RASCOE: That's NPR White House correspondent Asma Khalid.
