James Mattis, former Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson, Steve Mnuchin and Sen. Jeff Sessions have all been nominated to high-profile positions in President-elect Trump's Cabinet. Update: This post was updated on February 16, 2017, and will continue to be updated as other appointments are made. At a Thursday press conference, Donald Trump named one more person to his list of cabinet nominees: Alexander Acosta, dean of the Florida International University College of Law and former member of the National Labor Relations Board, is now nominated to head the Labor Department. He is taking the place of Andrew Puzder, who dropped out of the process this week in part due to questions about his past employment of person in the country illegally (including taxes paid in that instance) and personal life. NPR is tracking Trump's Cabinet as it grows, counting up the diversity and experience of his appointees, as well as a few specifics they might have in their resumes. So here's what Trump's Cabinet looks like by the numbers. Acosta's nomination means that 21 of 22 Cabinet-level positions (not counting the vice president) will have nominees \u2014 the CEA still doesn't have a nomination for its chairman. For the sake of apples-to-apples comparisons, we've compared all of those 22 posts across five presidents' initial Cabinets (for Trump we only count everything as a percentage of 21, as he has only chosen 21 people, and for Reagan and Clinton, we only count 21 appointees, as there was no Department of Homeland Security during their presidencies). Trump's Cabinet breaks with a trend toward diversity Of the 20 people he has chosen thus far, Trump's Cabinet has 15 white men. That's roughly in line with Ronald Reagan's initial Cabinet. However, it's also a swing away from a trend toward diversity over the last few presidents. President Obama's Cabinet in particular gained notice for its relative lack of white men. To draw a line between white and nonwhite, we used Census Bureau race and ethnicity categories, though unlike the census, we counted all Hispanics as nonwhite (the Census Bureau counts Hispanic as an ethnicity and not a race, meaning a person can be white and Hispanic). Alexander Acosta is the first Latino appointee to the Trump cabinet. The Census Bureau's system undersells diversity in some ways, though. For example, Obama Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood, George W. Bush Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham, and Clinton HHS Secretary Donna Shalala are all Arab-American. In the census, that counts as white, though some Arab-Americans disagree (and the Census Bureau itself is considering adding that category). Furthermore, it's not that the trend toward diversity has been as steady as the above chart seems to show; after all, these are just the presidents' first Cabinets. President Obama took some criticism for a less diverse circle of advisers in his second term. Diversity can mean bringing different perspectives to the administration. Of course, white men can be empathetic and open-minded, as National Urban League head Marc Morial recently told PBS NewsHour, but many Americans also look to the Cabinet as a sign of whether they are well-represented. \"The question is, do people feel their voices are heard? That's really important, that communities feel someone is at the table with my point of view,\" he said. Trump has chosen the outsider Cabinet Of course, there are other types of diversity \u2014 geographic, socioeconomic and experience, for example. And while Trump's team has been criticized for its economic profile (i.e., it includes multiple billionaires), it does break with usual Cabinet norms by being relatively light on established government figures. We've attempted to quantify this by classifying each Cabinet member by his or her most prominent jobs prior to joining the Cabinet (for example, Colin Powell had spent much of his working life in the military before joining George W. Bush's Cabinet). This required more than a few judgment calls \u2014 Glenn Hubbard (George W. Bush's CEA chair) had spent two years at the Treasury, but we decided he was primarily an academic, as he spent many more years in that field. Some of these are arguable: Was Hillary Clinton's career more prominently in \"government\" \u2014 that is, her time as senator \u2014 or as a first lady (which we'd classify as \"other,\" a category that includes people who are in politics but are not officeholders, like Reince Priebus)? We made her one of the few listed as more than one, as she straddles the line between the two worlds. Here we can see not only whose Cabinets were particularly heavy with people from the public sector (Obama) or the business world (Reagan, Trump), but also where different presidents have broken with tradition. Trump, like most of the last five presidents, will have someone from the business world heading the Small Business Administration. However, he will be the only president out of these to have a defense secretary (Mattis) with a chiefly military background. True, Donald Rumsfeld had been in the military, but afterward he made a career of working in government, while Mattis remained in the military through retirement. For a more holistic count of these Cabinet secretaries' careers, here is a breakdown of four different distinctions that Cabinet secretaries commonly hold. We counted up the initial Cabinet members who have had any experience in the military or government (at any level, from city to federal), as well as those who have served as CEOs or have earned Ph.D.'s. (This means these numbers will differ from those in the above table. Someone known best for government service may also have served in the military or have a Ph.D. or have been a CEO, for example \u2014 or even all four.) Once again, there were some judgment calls \u2014 does serving as the \"CEO\" of Chicago Public Schools \u2014 as Obama Education Secretary Arne Duncan did \u2014 really count as being a CEO? (We decided no; we're trying to count a type of business experience here, and public schools are a government entity. A similar but tougher call went into deciding that Timothy Geithner's time as New York Fed CEO didn't count either.) One other judgment call: we drew the line at Ph.D.s and excluded professional degrees, meaning that someone like Ben Carson, who of course studied extensively to be a neurosurgeon, would not be counted. There is also some debate about whether someone holding a law degree (a J.D., or juris doctor) should be considered a \"doctor.\" For simplicity's sake, we decided to draw our border at Ph.D. This is not meant to imply that these are the only four ways someone might be qualified to serve as a Cabinet secretary. Rather, these are four ways of measuring what type of a Cabinet a president has. A Cabinet that's relatively heavy with academics (Obama, Clinton) might work and think differently than does a Cabinet with more CEOs (Trump, George W. Bush).",

Attempting to court black voters over the last two months, Donald Trump has painted a pretty dire picture of their lives. \"You're living in poverty,\" he said in late August. \"Your schools are no good. You have no jobs. Fifty-eight percent of your youth is unemployed. What the hell do you have to lose?\" On Tuesday Trump took this rhetoric one step further, telling a North Carolina audience that \"our African-American communities are absolutely in the worst shape they've ever been in before. Ever, ever ever.\" Of course, Trump's statement ignores large, critically important eras in American history: slavery, and the Jim Crow laws that lingered for more than a century after the practice was abolished. But what about in more recent years? A look at major indicators like employment and health suggests that while African-Americans lag behind the rest of the country in many key areas, they've also experienced steady economic and socioeconomic gains. Let's start with unemployment. The black unemployment rate is more than 8 percent \u2013 that's more than three points higher than the national average. But it's halved from the recent post-recession high of 16.6 percent. \"Black America is like a caboose on a train,\" said National Urban League president Marc Morial recently told NPR's Scott Horsley. \"When the train speeds up, the caboose speeds up. But it's still the caboose.\" Black household income rose 4 percent last year, Horsley also reported. Trump repeatedly cites that 58 \u2013 sometimes he says 59 \u2014 percent unemployment rate among black youth. The actual figure is still quite high \u2013 about 27 percent \u2013 but nowhere near the six-in-ten number that Trump cites during his stump speech. The National Urban League puts out an annual report on the State of Black America. Its most recent survey shows educational progress over the last 40 years. \"Eighty-six percent of African Americans are high school completers, the share with a bachelor's degree or more has more than tripled (from 6.6 percent to 22.2 percent) and roughly one-third of 18-24-year-olds are enrolled in college,\" the study finds. \"While whites have increased college enrollment faster than Blacks between 1976 and 2014, the college completion gap has narrowed 20 percentage points over this time.\" Earlier this year, the New York Times examined health trends: A recent trove of federal data offered some good news. The suicide rate for black men declined from 1999 to 2014, making them the only racial group to experience a drop. Infant mortality is down by more than a fifth among blacks since the late 1990s, double the decline for whites. Births to teenage mothers, which tend to have higher infant mortality rates, have dropped by 64 percent among blacks since 1995, faster than for whites.  Blacks are still at a major health disadvantage compared with whites. But evidence of black gains has been building and has helped push up the ultimate measure \u2014 life expectancy. The gap between blacks and whites was seven years in 1990. By 2014, the most recent year on record, it had shrunk to 3.4 years, the smallest in history, with life expectancy at 75.6 years for blacks and 79 years for whites. And, primarily because of the Obamacare that Trump is vowing to begin repealing on his first day in office, the number of uninsured African-Americans dropped by nearly 10 points over the last three years. Trump's black outreach has been hit-or-miss. He's been criticized for primarily speaking to mostly-white campaign rallies, rather than directly addressing black voters. Trump's recent visit to a black church in Detroit went smoothly, but last week he picked a fight with an African-American pastor after a rocky visit to her Flint, Mich. church. Trump hit another stumble Tuesday, when boxing promoter Don King joined him at an Ohio campaign event, and accidentally said the N-word while making a point about how no matter how much money a black person earns, in King's mind, he'll still be \"a rich negro.\" \"If you are talented and intellectual, you are an intellectual negro,\" King said. \"If you are a dancing and sliding and gliding n***** \u2014 I mean negro \u2014 you are a dancing and sliding and grinding negro.\" King, a Cleveland native, attended the Republican National Convention. Trump had indicated King would address the gathering, but RNC officials reportedly nixed that idea, due to King's manslaughter conviction.",

            "article_content": "The thinking early on in this campaign was that Donald Trump pulled his support almost exclusively from white working class voters, but exit polls show his coalition of political backers is broad and expanding.  ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: And more now about who is voting for Donald Trump. He's drawing support from a surprisingly wide set of Republican voters. And his recent victories prove that his support is not defined by education levels. As NPR's Asma Khalid reports, Trump is doing well with voters who've attended college. ASMA KHALID, BYLINE: Donald Trump is fond of pointing out how much he's winning. Here he is after winning the Nevada caucuses last month. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DONALD TRUMP: We won the evangelicals. We won with young. We won with old. We won with highly educated. We won with poorly educated. I love the poorly educated. KHALID: And Trump's not exaggerating. Depending on the state, he's won Republicans of all stripes. Sure, he still does much, much better among white, working-class voters - that is his trump card so to speak. JARED FREEDMAN: I think that media, including NPR, like to portray Trump supporters as being predominantly disgruntled white Americans. KHALID: Jared Freedman is a software engineer in Florida. Trump also does really well with highly-educated voters like him. Sheila O'Brien also has a college degree and works in marketing. O'BRIEN: I speak to people of all walks of life, from your average, everyday, hourly workers to people that are, you know, CEOs of companies. And, you know, there's a wide array of people that like him. KHALID: Something that I often hear from Trump supporters is a concern about their own economic circumstances. Freedman says he's been hurt by globalization and the use of H1B visas for highly-skilled tech workers. FREEDMAN: And I've watched my wages go down to the point where actually I can't work for anybody anymore in order to maintain my quality of life. I have to have my own company. KHALID: So if Trump supporters are not all blue-collar, then what is the defining feature of a Trump voter? FREEDMAN: I think it's the difference between people who care about America and Americans and people who care about globalism. KHALID: Some of Trump's supporters admit he might be inflammatory, but he doesn't mean it. And they think he'll moderate his message in a general election. Richard DeNapoli is an attorney. He was a Jeb Bush supporter but now backs Trump. DeNapoli says part of Trump's appeal is that he's direct, not flowery. RICHARD DENAPOLI: I wouldn't say that he's anti-intellectual. I think that he just has a way of speaking which breaks through a lot of the media noise, and it's very authentic. KHALID: And he says the media media plays up Trump's provocative comments. DENAPOLI: I don't think there's a racist bone in Donald Trump's body. I really don't think so. KHALID: Regardless of education, the issue that unites Trump supporters is the belief that he'll use his business experience to clean up federal government. Here is Sheila O'Brien again. O'BRIEN: In the condition that our country is in now, I think that Trump is the only one that's going to be able to solve the major problems that we have. I don't think anybody else will be able to do that because they're too involved in Washington. KHALID: Education levels may have very little to do with Trump's appeal to voters, says Sam Abrams. He's a professor at Sarah Lawrence College and a researcher at the Hoover Institute. He studies political behavior and says there's only really one common trait among Trump supporters. SAM ABRAMS: He's channeling something that we deal with in psychology all the time and that's this authoritarian nature of a large portion of the electorate. And this cuts across all of these various cleavages. It doesn't cut across nicely by socioeconomic status or religion or anything like that. KHALID: Trump's broad coalition, which includes both college-educated and working-class voters, may make it hard for a Republican rival to stop him. But even as Trump is expanding his support, resistance to him is also growing. Last night's exit polls show large numbers of voters in Florida and Ohio say they'll consider a third-party candidate if Trump is the nominee. Asma Khalid, NPR News. Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.

Tuesday's big primary night helped both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump extend their delegate leads in their respective parties. And as each state votes, we're beginning to get a clearer glimpse at just who their supporters are. For Trump, his support continues to cross traditional demographic and socioeconomic lines, underscoring just how difficult it will continue to be for Republicans opposing his controversial candidacy to stop him. But some of his weaknesses with GOP voters could also be a problem for him in a general election. As for Clinton, she rebounded from last week's loss in Michigan by winning over white voters in Ohio and staved off another Midwest loss in Illinois thanks to black voters, proving she could be competitive outside of the South. Here are five big things we learned from exit polls last night: Donald Trump's amorphous coalition grows As Donald Trump continues to win primaries across the country, his broad coalition is hard to define. In all of Tuesday's contests, Trump did well with most demographics. Sure, he still has an overwhelming advantage among some \u2014 such as white working-class voters. But exit polls point to an amorphous winning coalition. Depending on the state, Trump won rich voters, poor voters, working-class voters, college-educated voters, suburban voters and rural voters. The one exception (see below) is Ohio, where the local governor, John Kasich, pulled off a win. But, for some perspective, in Florida, Trump won white working-class voters and white college-educated voters by about the same margins. Then, in North Carolina, he essentially broke even with Ted Cruz among evangelical voters. And, in Illinois, where the suburban vote was key (60 percent), he won that demographic by 12 percentage points (40 percent to Cruz's 28 percent). His two weaknesses: late-deciders and Hispanics. Trump is fond of saying \"the Hispanics love me,\" but Florida seemed to cast doubts on that claim. In the state's GOP primary, 17 percent of voters were Latino \u2014 and Rubio overwhelmingly beat Trump in that demographic (52 percent to 27 percent). Kasich had broad support in Ohio, but can he replicate it elsewhere? The Ohio governor pulled off something Marco Rubio couldn't: winning his home state. He did so by edging out Trump with some of his usually reliable voting blocs \u2014 men, older voters, white voters and college graduates. He won every age group, beat Trump with female voters by 13 points, and carried voters under 30 by 21 points. For comparison, in Florida, Trump crushed Rubio in all those demographics. The state's sitting senator ended up winning just one county in the Sunshine State \u2014 his home of Miami-Dade. But the big win in the state he's never lost a race in could be the apex for Kasich. It's his first statewide win of the presidential race. He's looking ahead toward other states with makeups like Pennsylvania to possibly replicate that coalition, but in any other state where he hasn't been on the ballot for more than three decades (or basically camped out in like in New Hampshire) he's been almost an asterisk. Clinton's Midwestern wins came thanks to both white and black voters Sure, Illinois and Ohio are both Midwestern states that border the Great Lakes, but there aren't many parallels between Clinton's dual victories there. Clinton's big win of the night came from Ohio, where she performed better than she did in Michigan, which she lost to Sanders just a week ago, in many parallel categories. The two states have some similar demographics: Both are industrial states with large union populations. But in essentially every key group that Clinton lost to Sanders in Michigan, she won (or tied) in Ohio. White voters were especially key to her victory. In Michigan, Clinton lost white college graduates by 11 points. In Ohio, she won that same group by nine points. Likewise, in Michigan, she lost the union vote by three points, but in Ohio, she won it by 12 points. And \u2014 perhaps the most fascinating factor in her Ohio victory, given her apparent weakness on trade issues after the Michigan defeat \u2014 she won by 10 points among Ohioans who said trade with other countries \"takes away U.S. jobs.\" Illinois, which was a might tighter race, paints a different picture: Clinton struggled with white voters, as she did in Michigan. She lost both white working-class and college-educated folks. And, on that same trade question, she seemed more vulnerable in Illinois, losing to Sanders by 11 points. Her saving grace were black voters (who made up about 28 percent of the Democratic electorate). She won them overwhelmingly, beating Sanders by 41 percentage points. Clinton's strength among Hispanics grows Clinton's 30-point win in Florida was partly fueled by Hispanic voters, another valuable voting bloc in November. Twenty percent of the Democratic electorate was Latino, and she beat Sanders with those voters 72 percent to 28 percent. That continues a trend for Clinton. In Texas earlier this month, she also topped Sanders in voting by the 28 percent of Hispanic voters making up that electorate, beating him by 34 points with this group. In Nevada, there was some dispute over the accuracy of the entrance polls in the state's Democratic caucuses. The next big test for Sanders in winning over Latino voters is in Arizona next Tuesday. His campaign has raised expectations in this state \u2014 and it's where he was campaigning last night. Third-party rumbling is growing As Trump grew his delegate lead on Tuesday night, the so-called #NeverTrump movement (Republicans who are pledging never to unite behind the controversial candidate) could pick up some steam, too, especially after Rubio's withdrawal. And there are some encouraging signs for those Republicans who want another alternative this fall. In Florida exit polls, 29 percent of voters said they'd consider a third-party candidate if it's Trump and Clinton who are the nominees. And nearly a quarter of GOP voters in the critical general election swing state said they would not vote for Trump. In Ohio, another must-win for Republicans in November, 43 percent of Republican voters said they would consider a third-party alternative.",

For more than a hundred years, Vigo County, Indiana has consistently voted for the winning president. It chose Barack Obama twice, and then picked Donald Trump this November. In fact, the county is a remarkably accurate bellwether; it's only been wrong two times since the 1890s. Why does Vigo County almost always predict the winner? There are many hypotheses, none of which fully explain this quirky mystery of why a small region in southwest Indiana (a reliably Republican state) routinely jumps from Democrat to Republican in presidential years. For starters, the county's demographics don't provide any particularly helpful clues. \"Vigo County is more white than the nation,\" explained Matthew Bergbower, a political science professor at Indiana State University. \"The nation overall is far more diverse on Hispanics than Vigo County. On education levels, Vigo County is less educated. And, then...if you're gonna look at income, Vigo County is poorer.\" Brandon Woods, 31, is an apprentice with the local IBEW. He voted for Donald Trump despite union appeals to support Clinton.\n                \n                    \n                    Asma Khalid/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Brandon Woods, 31, is an apprentice with the local IBEW. He voted for Donald Trump despite union appeals to support Clinton. Rather than demographics, the answer seems to be part geographic and part economic. The economy in Vigo County used to be vibrant. Some of the vestiges of those glory days are still found in the rich art deco architecture in downtown Terre Haute, but the local economy has been stagnating for decades. Manufacturing plants have shut down and unions have lost a lot of their influence. That made this place particularly ripe for Trump's economic message. But there's another major factor that might explain the county's predictive power - it's a mix of rural and urban communities. The county is home to four colleges, and students tend to vote for Democrats. The county seat of Terre Haute is a small city and urban voters also tend to support Democrats. \"Then if you drive a couple miles away, you're gonna see farms \u2013 you're gonna see soybean, you're gonna see corn, you're gonna see hayfields and and we know how they lean in presidential elections,\" said Bergbower, referring to research that shows rural voters lean Republican. So although Vigo County is racially and socioeconomically homogeneous, it's also a political mix of registered Republicans and Democrats, old union members and young college students, city folks and farmers - and for years that mix of people has helped make the county a sort of election oracle. But, in some ways Vigo County is also a model of old political divisions. It's an overwhelmingly white county at a moment when the country is browning and identity politics have become increasingly powerful fault lines in party politics. Bergbower says he's skeptical Vigo County will be an accurate bellwether for the next 100 years. But for the moment, it's a helpful guide in understanding what some voters saw in Trump. One Theory: Vigo County is Full of \"Real People\" Maverick Oldham, 20, said he did not vote for President because he got busy with classes. If he had voted, he would have chosen the Democratic candidate.\n                \n                    \n                    Asma Khalid/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Maverick Oldham, 20, said he did not vote for President because he got busy with classes. If he had voted, he would have chosen the Democratic candidate. Bernard Gibson is a long-time Vigo County voter and he has his own theory about the county's bellwether reputation, which he explained as he picked up heat lamps for his baby chickens with his great grand-daughter Oakley at farm supply shop called Rural King. \"These are real people here, these are not New York City, Chicago, Los Angeles,\" said Gibson. \"You know, these are real people that live everyday from hand to hand, just have to work to make a living and everything else.\" Gibson personally voted for Donald Trump this year; he didn't love the idea, but he wanted a change. \"Well, I think we picked the lesser of two evils,\" he said. \"I think that's what we had to do this time, it's not necessarily the best.\" But like Vigo County, Gibson does not always choose a Republican president. Back in 2008, he voted for Barack Obama because he liked Obama's message of \"hope and change.\" \"It was a good message,\" Gibson said referring to Obama's campaign slogans. \"It's the same way with Trump now, you know \u2013 'Make America Great Again' \u2013 whether he will or not, it's the idea that's what he's trying for.\" Gibson says the other influential factor for him was religion. \"I'm a Christian; he's the only one, either one of them, that ever spoke anything about God and the country,\" said Gibson. \"This country was founded that way.\" Even though Gibson personally went back-and-forth politically in recent presidential elections; nationally, rural voters have leaned Republican, as NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben has discussed. Traditionally that GOP voting bloc might have been counter-balanced by an equally, if not more, powerful voting group in Vigo County \u2014 unions that for years were reliable Democrats. Waning Power of Union Democrats At the Labor Temple in Terre Haute on a recent morning, about a dozen union leaders, electricians, plumbers, carpenters and pipefitters, met to discuss business. Individually, these men are all solid Democrats; but Brian Davidson with the carpenters union said he struggled to convince his members to follow the union leadership's advice. \"We asked our members who they were voting for...[and] they couldn't wait to tell me they were voting for Trump,\" said Davidson. \"I mean they couldn't wait to get it in my face, 'Hey, yeah, what are you going to do about it \u2013 yeah, I'm voting for Trump. I don't care what you say, you're not gonna tell me what to do.'\" All the men in the room nodded with Davidson and shared their stories, agreeing that this year it was particularly difficult for them to solidify support behind the Democratic nominee. Ron Morin with the local cement masons and plasterers union said many union members in the county are social conservatives, and so sometimes they were more concerned about abortion and guns rather than their wallets. \"When our members will wake their rear ends up is when they watch their wages and their pensions and their health insurance dump into the toilet,\" said Morin. \"They'll wake up and they'll say 'Wow, I'm working for $12 bucks an hour now.' That's when they're going to wake up and it's going to be too late.\" Brandon Woods is exactly the kind of union member these men are referring to. He's an apprentice electrician - a former military man, who sports boots, a long beard, and a camouflage hat. Woods voted for Trump, in part he said because he's tired of the \"political propaganda everywhere.\" For him, that \"propaganda\" includes the idea that voting for Democrats is better for union guys like him. \"I don't really buy it,\" he said. \"There's big business on the Democratic side that are owning half the politicians that are up there. They do everything they want them to do. And, it's just us trying to make it on the bottom here.\" The Political Power of Non-Voters Part of Trump's success in Vigo County, which mirrors his success nationally, is that some people who had voted for Barack Obama stayed home this year. \"This is the first presidential one I missed,\" said Dave Cochran, as he walked to his truck to get some supplies on a construction site. Cochran, a 16-year union member said he's not exactly sure why he didn't vote this November. \"The choices maybe...[I] definitely didn't like Hillary. Donald? We'll see what he does,\" Cochran said. Cochran said he might have voted for Bernie Sanders if he had been the Democratic nominee, but he just felt Clinton was \"caught in too many lies.\" \"Even around here...there was quite a few that didn't vote for that reason, they didn't like the choice, and we'll see where it goes now,\" said Cochran. But unions aren't the only local Democratic force. A College Hub Sharon Boyle, 45, voted for Clinton. She teaches music therapy at a local college. There are four colleges in Vigo County.\n                \n                    \n                    Asma Khalid/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Sharon Boyle, 45, voted for Clinton. She teaches music therapy at a local college. There are four colleges in Vigo County. Vigo County is home to four colleges, and people in the area say the schools are one of the major bastions for Democrats. \"I really wanted Clinton to win,\" said Sharon Boyle, a doctoral student and music therapy teacher who was studying statistics at a local coffee shop. \"I just [couldn't] vote for someone who obviously isn't supporting people who are different and minorities.\" Boyle said she has cried multiple times in the days since the election. \"It was really painful,\" she said, acknowledging that she knows people in the area who voted for Trump, and she doesn't want to demonize them. Boyle is a Montana native who moved to the area 15 years ago. She said the politics in Vigo County are confusing; in fact, she was more surprised by her county in 2012 than she was in 2016. She didn't expect Vigo to twice elect Obama. \"I just don't perceive progressive candidate doing well in this area,\" she said. Still the county did vote for Obama two times and that's not just because of faculty like Boyle. President Obama energized local students. This year, there wasn't that same enthusiasm among students around the campus of Indiana State University, the large public university in the county. Maverick Oldham was chatting with friends near the main fountain on campus. He's a self-described 20-year-old liberal passionate about gay rights, but he said he didn't vote because he got tied up with classes. \"If Bernie [Sanders] had been a decision, I might have been a little more inclined to vote,\" Oldham said, referencing his dream candidate. In hindsight, the English major with long wavy hair and a faint mustache, said he wishes he had voted. \"[Because] I have little to no faith that any progressive movements are going to be made in the next four years,\" Oldham said.",

As tens of thousands of politicians, party delegates and protesters swept through the City of Brotherly Love this week for the Democratic National Convention, dozens of homeless Philadelphians and out-of-towners pitched tents on a grassy lot. They were part of a protest over the four days of the convention organized by Cheri Honkala, a Philadelphia-based activist with the Poor People's Economic Human Rights Campaign. Boarded-up buildings and empty lots dot the Kensington neighborhood, which was once a manufacturing hub of Philadelphia.\n                \n                    \n                    Meg Kelly/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Boarded-up buildings and empty lots dot the Kensington neighborhood, which was once a manufacturing hub of Philadelphia. She put together a similar demonstration during Pope Francis' visit to Philadelphia last year, calling it \"The Church of the Poor.\" This time, Honkala set up camp in Kensington, a Philadelphia neighborhood that was once a manufacturing hub, and named the tent city \"Clintonville,\" harkening back to the \"Hooverville\" camps of the Great Depression during President Herbert Hoover's administration. There's currently no Clinton in the White House, but Honkala said the camp's name was a critique of Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign and of President Bill Clinton's bid to \"end welfare as we have come to know it\" by signing a reform law that put in place work requirements and limits on cash assistance. The goal of this protest, she explained, was to draw more attention to families who are living below the poverty line and struggling to survive. Volunteers created temporary homes in an open space with used furniture left in dumpsters and other castaways from Philadelphia's more well-to-do areas. \"Just a mile away, you can find people throwing away nice couches and chairs,\" said Honkala, who ran as the Green Party's vice presidential candidate in 2012. For Philadelphia resident Dee Snyder, Clintonville was less about activism than shelter. After she and her two adult children were evicted from their apartment, Snyder spent days scrambling to escape the hot and stormy weather and to find a place to sleep. Homeless shelters, she said, were out of the question. Volunteers dismantle the \"Clintonville\" campsite on the last day of the Democratic National Convention.\n                \n                    \n                    Hansi Lo Wang/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Volunteers dismantle the \"Clintonville\" campsite on the last day of the Democratic National Convention. \"They don't take dogs,\" explained Snyder, 62, who owns two. \"I don't want to get rid of them. We've had them for ten years. You don't just give them away.\" Her son eventually found the tent city set up in a vacant lot about seven miles north of the convention arena. They slept on tattered mattresses under a blue tarp held up by makeshift wooden frames. \"We were told we could stay through the storm,\" she said. \"So we have to ride out the storm until things get figured out.\"  During the day, many of the Clintonville demonstrators took their activism to the streets, marching and participating in other protests, including a \"fart-in\" organized by Honkala.  Others with young children or unable to walk in the heat stayed behind, trying to cool off in the shade next to piles of canned food. Sandra Rivera, a protest organizer working with Honkala, pushed her one-year-old daughter around the camp in a stroller. She questioned whether the $60 million a local fundraising committee was expected to raise to host the DNC was being put to good use.  \"I want to see those millions that they promised for schools,\" she said. Stephanie Torres was born and raised in Kensington, a neighborhood, she says, full of \"bad energy\" and \"bullets with no name.\"\n                \n                    \n                    Meg Kelly/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Stephanie Torres was born and raised in Kensington, a neighborhood, she says, full of \"bad energy\" and \"bullets with no name.\"  Other local residents who walked by the tent city also said they wanted to see more resources invested into low-income neighborhoods like Kensington, which had one of the city's largest numbers of violent crimes last year, according to a report by the Pew Charitable Trusts.  Mario Morales, 56, said he supported the protesters but was skeptical of how much convention attendees would pay attention. \"Will they take time out to come here and see the sadness and the hopelessness and the pain and the broken dreams, man?\" he wondered aloud. \"Or would they rather go look at the nice markets and the nice cheesesteaks?\" If any convention delegates did venture to Kensington, they would have found a neighborhood that Stephanie Torres said she's not proud to call home. \"You wouldn't want to be raised or grow up around here,\" said the 22-year-old bartender who has \"Ambition\" tattooed above her left eyebrow. \"You just got to stay alive. Day by day, it's just surviving.\"",

            "article_content": "Whitesburg, Kentucky, was an area once known for coal mining but most of those jobs have dried up. Limited opportunities force many residents to leave, but some are able to find their way back.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: And I'm Steve Inskeep with the view from Appalachia, exploring how national issues look from a local level. We're in Knoxville, Tenn., where people say Appalachia, not Appalachia. We're before a live audience at Holly's Gourmets Kitchen and joined by some of our friends from NPR's Generation Listen and WUOT in Knoxville. Anybody listen to that station here? (APPLAUSE) INSKEEP: We are in a region shaped by generations of migration. Now a new wave of economic migrants is leaving and sometimes coming back, for example, Gary Bentley who met us at a coal mine where he used to work in tunnels, sometimes just 36-inches high. How do you work in a tunnel that's only 3-feet high? GARY BENTLEY: Crawling on your hands and knees for 12 hours, it's - it can be intense. INSKEEP: That doesn't sound like any fun. BENTLEY: No, it's not fun, but when it's the only thing you know, you become accustomed to it. And you just - it's another day at work. INSKEEP: Dangerous work that cost his grandfather his arm. Yet, Bentley says the pay of $70,000 per year was like an addiction. BENTLEY: You grow up in this area, and the coal miners are the ones who were able to provide their families with things that not everybody else could have. And it's, you know, the idea that these people go to work every day knowing that they may not make it back home alive in order to provide for their families and make a better life. So there's something about that that just kind of tugs at you. INSKEEP: Bentley lost his job as the coal market collapsed a few years ago. Letcher County, Ky., once had thousands of coal jobs. It now has 100. Bentley had to move to the far side of his state. Because he's divorced, he had to leave his daughter. Can we just mention, this is a long state. You were hundreds of miles from your daughter. BENTLEY: Yes, I think 384 miles exactly (laughter). INSKEEP: Not that anybody was counting. BENTLEY: Yeah, no. It was a six-hour trip roughly. So it was a struggle. INSKEEP: Now this former coal miner lives in Lexington, Ky., and works in a Dixie Cup factory. Other people want out of Letcher County. We found Shawna Gabrielle Koontz (ph) working and studying at a community college. She is 20 and a single mom. SHAWNA GABRIELLE KOONTZ: My baby daddy wasn't someone I thought he was, and it didn't work out. And he never comes around, so I'm doing everything on my own. I can do it. That's why I want to go into the military. INSKEEP: After the military, she wants to be a state trooper, but not in her home county where drug abuse is a problem. KOONTZ: If I be a cop here, then I'll probably arresting some of my friends (laughter), honestly. And a lot of my friends has gone downhill, and it would kind of suck if I put like one of my used-to-be-close friends in the back of a cop car. So that's why I want to go away and be a cop. It's like every day you see on the news, like, people getting busted for meth. And I don't want to be around here no more. INSKEEP: Migration made Appalachia what it is today. European settlers pushed into these hills seeking a better life. After World War II, many of their descendents departed for Midwestern factories. In recent years, Letcher County, Ky., has lost another 5 percent of its population. Yet, something happens to many migrants. It happened to Shawna K. Rodenburg (ph) after she went to college and got out. Something drew her back. SHAWNA RODENBURG: I love it here. There's nowhere else that I really feel like myself. In Letcher County, I don't feel like I have to have any kind of artifice, pretend to be something that I'm not. INSKEEP: She now commutes to Eastern Kentucky, driving hundreds of miles once a week to teach English at a community college. In a Whitesburg, Ky., restaurant, we talked with two Letcher County natives who returned full time. Elizabeth Sanders (ph) and Brad Shepherd (ph), each made choices to try their fortunes. ELIZABETH SANDERS: I was really clear with myself when I came back that, you know, my parents really felt like they needed to move away for certain opportunities. And I wanted to figure out for myself how I can be here and raise a family here and hopefully that'll happen. BRAD SHEPHERD: Growing up, you don't know what you want to do. It just doesn't seem like the place. There's no opportunity unless you wanted to work in the coal mines. So I was like, well, I'm getting out of here before there's nothing to do. But you just keep wanting to come home. INSKEEP: So here they are. Elizabeth Sanders works for Appalshop, a media organization. Brad Shepherd and his husband opened Heritage Kitchen, the restaurant where we sat. It's trendy with the waitress wearing black on a surprisingly vibrant Main Street. Granted, it's not always easy to do business. How's the internet in Letcher County? (LAUGHTER) SHEPHERD: Laughable. INSKEEP: People here are laughing, too. Internet's great in Knoxville, right? UNIDENTIFIED CROWD: No. INSKEEP: No? OK. Often the credit card charges don't go through, though Shepherd still has hopes that his move will bring him profit. Now, Chris Green has been listening to all these voices. He studies Appalachia at Berea College in Kentucky. What do you think about when you hear those stories? CHRIS GREEN: All those stories resonate. They're stories of people working to make their lives happen, stories of people who love where they are and stories figuring out how to stay there as well. INSKEEP: Well, how much practical help are coal counties or former coal counties in many cases getting from their government? GREEN: Tremendous help, actually. There's something called the Shaping Our Appalachian Region which was based in between Kentucky's governor and Hal Rogers, the federal head of the... INSKEEP: Congressman, OK. GREEN: ...Yeah, Congressman. There's also the Promise Zone, which is bringing in over $200 million. This is a zone of six counties that is working with not-for-profit. It's working with private entities. It's working with funders in order to sustain the economic diversity. INSKEEP: Why - briefly though - do people feel otherwise? People don't feel like the government's doing anything for them. GREEN: I think it's because the government is not overt about it. It's because it's going to the people to make it happen. It's working with the shop owners. It's working with the people who are getting insurance. It's working with the people of the community level. It's not a top-down imposition. INSKEEP: Chris Green, thanks very much. We're going to continue hearing from you throughout this program. We're getting the view from Appalachia. We're before a live audience here at Holly's Gourmets Market. And the people who are with us, by the way, include a distinguished Knoxville musician, R.B. Morris. Mr. Morris, would you take us out of this segment please? R.B. MORRIS: (Singing) In this whole world that we got today, who knows how it goes? You may rise, but you may fall. And that's the way it rose. And him that gets will be him that gives. What you got may help. They say a rich man, he may lose his soul by saving all that wealth, but it's hell, hell on a poor boy. It's hell, hell on a poor boy. Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.  Visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.

The right is sacred to her today.    \"Every time there's a vote, I go,\" she said. The presidential contest moves South on Super Tuesday, March 1. The region is considered a firewall for Hillary Clinton because of her strong support among African-American voters, a key bloc of Southern Democrats. Greensboro, Ala. is in the heart of the black belt \u2014 named for its rich black soil and known as a place where the right to vote is sacred. \"I'm a foot soldier,\" said 80-year-old Theresa Burroughs. \"Every time there's a vote, I go.\" She marched from Selma to Montgomery for the right to vote in 1965, and was a member of the Hale County Civic Improvement League \u2014 one of the nation's first grassroots civil rights organizations. Burroughs is founder of the Safe House Black History Museum in Greensboro, a clapboard shotgun house on the edge of town. \"This is the place where we kept Dr. Martin Luther King safe,\" she said. Local activists hid him from the Ku Klux Klan on a visit to west Alabama in March of 1968, just two weeks before King was assassinated in Memphis. Burroughs says there's still a struggle for voting rights in the black belt. The state has curtailed driver's license offices in the predominantly African-American counties here, yet requires an ID to vote. \"This is just another stage of harassing us and trying to get us ... to disappear,\" Burroughs says. \"We're not going to do that.\" Burroughs will be at the polls on Tuesday, and there's no question who she'll vote for. \"It's Hillary all the way,\" she says. \"She's taken all the steps. It's no place up to go but president.\" The historic Hale County Courthouse in downtown Greensboro, Ala. The county was home to one of the nation's first groups to advocate for equal voting rights \u2014 the Hale County Civic Improvement League.\n                \n                    \n                    Debbie Elliott/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption The historic Hale County Courthouse in downtown Greensboro, Ala. The county was home to one of the nation's first groups to advocate for equal voting rights \u2014 the Hale County Civic Improvement League. Hillary Clinton has earned it, Burroughs says. She admits she's never even considered voting for Bernie Sanders. Clinton has endorsements from Democratic Congresswoman Terri Sewell and a host of African-American mayors in Alabama. Burroughs says that's because active Democrats here feel a connection to the Clintons. \"She's been here,\" Burroughs says. \"She knows us personally. She knows the condition.\" The condition \u2014 this is one of the poorest areas of the country. Most counties in Alabama's black belt have double-digit unemployment, and more than a quarter of the population lives below the federal poverty line. As farm jobs have dwindled, towns have struggled to lure industry to replace them. The historic Hale County Courthouse anchors Main Street in Greensboro. There's the furniture store, the hardware shop, and a few other businesses. Some of them are run by the non-profit HERO \u2014 the Hale Empowerment and Revitalization Organization. The group develops housing and runs a GED program for young adults. \"I just feel like Hillary Clinton would be a good president,\" says Drewquita Lanier, who is 22 years old, said recently as about a dozen students, most in their 20s, wrapped up a day of testing. They took a break to talk politics. \"Not just because she's a woman but she knows a lot that low income people need help. That's why I'm electing her.\" Most of her classmates are undecided, and express frustration that they've been left behind. \"I don't think we have a voice for us,\" said Jalisa Travis. Raven Sewell wants a candidate who can help break the cycle of poverty. \"I can say honestly say I'm almost there,\" Sewell said. She's close to earning her high school equivalency diploma. \"I have my own place to live. I'm working on a car. Some people really trying, they just need an extra hoist,\" says Sewell. Unlike other places where Bernie Sanders has fired up young voters, his message has not reached these rural African-American students. Sewell is surprised to hear that he wants to make college free. \"Now that sounds wonderful,\" she said. Bernie Sanders has to ramp up the message if he's going to cut through Hillary Clinton's support in the South come Super Tuesday. She's strong not only with African-Americans but also with more moderate white Democrats. Larry Burt works at a plastics container plant. He's lunching at the Pie Lab in downtown Greensboro. \"The pie is real good today,\" he says. \"I don't know what kind of politics are cooking.\" He's something of a political anomaly in Alabama \u2013 a white middle-aged man who still votes Democratic. And he's leaning toward Clinton. \"She's as close to we have being in the middle as anybody right now,\" Burt says. \"I'd hate to see the decision coming down between the socialist and the billionaire real estate mogul from Manhattan.\"",

Alex Jones has a following. His radio show is carried on more than 160 stations, and he has more than 1.8 million subscribers on YouTube. And he claims to have the ear of the next president of the United States. Jones is also one of the nation's leading promoters of conspiracy theories \u2014 some of which take on lives of their own. He has been a chief propagator of untrue and wild claims about a satanic sex trafficking ring run by one of Hillary Clinton's top advisers out of a pizzeria in Washington, D.C. Days before a self-described \"investigator\" entered the pizzeria and fired off several rounds, Jones suggested he might investigate in person. \"I may just have to take off a week and just only research this and actually go to where these places are and stuff,\" Jones said. \"Fact, I'm looking at getting on a plane. ... I can't just say something and not see it for myself. They go to these pizza places. There's like satanic art everywhere.\" The Daily Beast reported the shooter was a fan on Facebook of Jones' Infowars website. Jones did not respond to requests for comment on the incident or his other theories. Jones has claimed the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks were an inside job, that the deadly shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School was a hoax, and that President Obama would round up people into concentration camps. \"He comes out of this kind of '90s fusion paranoia background where it's really more about opposition to the powers that be from any old direction,\" says Jesse Walker, author of The United States Of Paranoia. \"It really is this idea of people's autonomy and freedom and health being threatened by this grand amorphous force that's within the big institutions of society but larger than them.\" Walker contends Jones' all-encompassing assault on authority does not fall neatly along conservative or liberal lines. That said, the Southern Poverty Law Center, which monitors hate groups, says his attacks inspire a strong following among racists. Heidi Beirich, director of the SPLC's intelligence project, calls Jones a gateway drug for white supremacy, though she says he does not espouse explicitly racist views. Many white supremacist leaders tracked by the center have written that Jones' broadcasts open their minds to new thinking as they adopted their racist philosophy, Beirich says. Jones says he has a friend and ally in Donald Trump. Last December, Trump appeared on Infowars for an interview just weeks before the first Republican primaries. In that interview, Trump praised Jones for having an \"amazing\" reputation and his audience for its support. After the election, Jones said Trump called to thank him for his support, a claim the Trump camp, notably, neither confirmed nor denied. Jones' influence can be seen in other ways as well. Trump has claimed 3 million people voted in the presidential election illegally \u2014 another theory that would require a wide-ranging conspiracy of public officials from both parties, for which there is no proof. And the man named by Trump to serve as national security adviser, retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, has repeatedly pushed unfounded conspiracy theories online. His son, Michael Flynn Jr., who had been working on Flynn's involvement in Trump's transition, frequently retweeted Infowars. According to CNN, his Facebook and Twitter profile photographs previously showed him in an Infowars T-shirt. On Tuesday, Vice President-elect Mike Pence confirmed to CNN's Jake Tapper that the younger Flynn is no longer involved in work for the transition team.

            "article_content": "If the Trump administration decides to drop an appeal of a legal setback involving Obamacare subsidies, the insurance exchanges could be hobbled.\n                \n                    \n                    Karen Bleier/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption If the Trump administration decides to drop an appeal of a legal setback involving Obamacare subsidies, the insurance exchanges could be hobbled. Republicans have been vowing for six years now to repeal the Affordable Care Act. They have voted to do so dozens of times, despite knowing any measures would be vetoed by President Obama. But the election of Donald Trump as president means Republican lawmakers wouldn't even have to pass repeal legislation to stop the health law from functioning. Instead, President Trump could do much of it with a stroke of a pen. Trump \"absolutely, through executive action, could have tremendous interference to the point of literally stopping a train on its tracks,\" said Sara Rosenbaum, a professor of law and health policy at George Washington University in Washington, D.C. Trump is set to take office at a tricky time for the health law, with many Americans in both parties complaining about rising premiums and other out-of-pocket costs. The Republican-led Congress has refused to make changes to the law that would help it work better \u2014 such as offering a fix when insurers cancelled policies that individuals thought they would be able to keep. As staunch opponents of the law, they, of course, have little incentive to improve it. When problems have arisen, Obama has often used his executive authority to try to solve them. And it's this very mechanism Trump could use to undermine the law. As president, the Republican \"can just reverse\" Obama's actions in many cases, said Nicholas Bagley, a law professor at the University of Michigan who writes about health policy. A president \"can't undo the basic architecture of the law, but you can throw sand into the gears,\" he said. Formal regulations would take time to undo, because they must follow a lengthy process allowing for public comment. But there are several measures Trump could take on Day One of his presidency to cripple the law's effectiveness. Perhaps Trump's easiest action \u2014 and the one that would produce the largest impact \u2014 would be to drop the administration's appeal of a lawsuit filed by Republican House members in 2014. That suit, House v. Burwell, charged that the Obama administration was unconstitutionally spending money that Congress hadn't formally appropriated, to reimburse health insurers who were providing coverage to working-poor policyholders \u2014 those earning between 100 and 250 percent of the federal poverty line. More than half of people who purchase insurance in the health exchanges get the additional help, which reduces out-of-pocket health spending on deductibles and coinsurance. While that help for consumers is required under the law, the funding was not specifically included. (Tax credits for people with incomes up to four times the poverty level to help defray the cost of premiums are a separate program and were permanently funded in the ACA.) In April, Federal District Court Judge Rosemary Collyer ruled in favor of the House Republicans. \"Such an appropriation cannot be inferred,\" she wrote of the payments, and insurer \"reimbursements without an appropriation thus violates the Constitution.\" However, Collyer declined to enforce her decision, pending an appeal to a higher court. That appeal was filed in July and is still months away from resolution. If Trump wanted to seriously damage the ACA, he could simply order the appeal dropped, letting the lower court ruling stand, and stop reimbursing insurers who are giving deep discounts to half their customers. That move would wreak havoc, said Michael Cannon of the libertarian Cato Institute, a longtime opponent of the health law. The insurers would still have to provide the discounts, as required by law, he said, \"but they're no longer getting subsidies from the federal government to cover the cost. So they are going to be selling insurance to these people way below the cost of that coverage.\" Even those who support the law say that mismatch would effectively shut down the health exchanges, because insurers would simply drop out. A Trump administration \"really could collapse the federal exchange marketplace and the state exchanges if they end cost-sharing\" payments to insurers,\" said Rosenbaum, who has been a strong backer of the health law. There is already some concern about the continuing viability of the exchanges after several large insurers, including Aetna and United HealthCare, announced they would be dropping out for 2017. Another way Trump could undermine the health law would be by simply not enforcing its provisions, particularly the individual mandate that requires most people to have insurance. That requirement is supposed to ensure that healthy as well as sick people sign up, thus spreading the costs of people with high bills across a larger population. But \"executive branch non-enforcement could make a real difference to the vitality of the exchanges going forward,\" Bagley said. If healthy people don't sign up, sick people would need to pay more money for their insurance. Aside from inflicting damage to the exchanges, the administration could also affect the law's operations by refusing to approve states' changes to their Medicaid programs. States rely on federal regulators to sign off on changes large and small, including which citizens are eligible, to keep their Medicaid programs operating. \"There are so many things that an administration that doesn't want a program to work can do,\" Rosenbaum said. The bigger question, though, is not what Trump could do to cripple the health law \u2014 it's what he would do. He has addressed the issue only rarely \u2014 characterizing the health law as, simply, \"a disaster\" \u2014 and his plans for it aren't clear. \"It's one thing to talk about ripping insurance from 20 million people\" who are newly covered, Bagley said. \"It's another to actually do it.\" Health policy analysts on both sides of the aisle also still question where health care fits on Trump's priority list. \"A big unknown is how aggressive Trump would remain in going beyond rhetorically opposing Obamacare,\" said Thomas Miller, a resident fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. \"His report card as a presidential candidate reads, 'Donald needs to improve his attention, effort, and study habits. He is easily distracted and seems to prefer just picking fights with others.' \" Perhaps most important, Cato's Cannon says, is not whether Trump could single-handedly undo the health law, but whether he could undermine it enough to force Congress to take action. If Trump were to do just enough to cause the insurance exchanges to fail, he said, \"that would put pressure on Congress ... to reopen the law.\" Editor's note: A version of this story was first published by Kaiser Health News on Oct. 7.

The country's new budget will cut the taxes on materials used in heels and soles. The local media are calling it the \"Robin Hood\" budget. The government of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, eager to win support among the urban and rural poor, is announcing programs to improve conditions for low-income people and provide tax breaks for necessities and items that might improve their lives. Meanwhile, to bring in more funds for government spending, there are now higher taxes for luxury items. Farmers in particular are getting a helping hand \u2014 and that's a smart political calculus, because Modi needs their support to win re-election in 2019. The government hopes that multibillion-dollar subsidies for irrigation, new roads and other assists will double the income of farmers in five years. \"Highly commendable,\" said agronomist M.S. Swaminathan, the father of India's Green Revolution. A skeptical Hindustan Times, however, notes that such income generation will \"require a dramatic improvement in yields, technologies, good prices for farm produce \u2014 and some magic.\" The budget also promises to bring electricity to all 18,500-plus Indian villages in the next 1,000 days and to provide cooking gas connections for families below the poverty line, so they won't have to burn substances like cow manure in their homes, which can cause ill health effects. Startups are getting a boost: no tax on profits for three out of the first five years. (Although critics argue that very few actually generate profit that soon.) Under this Robin Hood budget, those who earn more than 11 million rupees ($161,389) will now be taxed at a rate of 35.5 percent, up from 34.6 percent. As for the list of taxes (and tax cuts), sometimes it makes perfect sense and sometimes it's a little mystifying. Why pick on cashews? Here's a rundown of some new regulations from the massive new budget. Note: In many cases, the government did not give a reason for the change in a specific tax. The cost of eating out creeps up. Indian diners pay a \"service tax\" of about 12 percent on 40 percent of the total bill. That amount is inching up by 0.5 percent. Shoes are cheaper. The tax on rubber and resins used in soles and heels has been reduced. Golfers won't be happy. Maybe you should buy some of those cheaper shoes, because the tax on an imported golf cart will jump from 10 percent to 60 percent. Nuts to nuts. Cashews are already expensive, and new taxes will make them even costlier. Water will bring in more revenue. The tax on mineral water will go up. Indians guzzle bottled water like crazy because tap water isn't safe to drink. Products that contribute to disease will cost more. The excise tax on tobacco products is going up to discourage consumption. Cheaper health costs. To increase the affordability of treatment for renal diseases, clinics and hospitals won't have to pay duty fees on imported parts for kidney dialysis equipment. Gamblers will be losers. Lottery tickets will cost more, and the tax on horse race winnings will rise from 5,000 rupees (about $73) to 10,000 rupees ($146). Fancy cars will cost more. With pollution a huge concern, there's now a 4 percent tax on big cars that use a lot of gas, like SUVs. In addition, India's rich will pay a premium for luxury cars, with a tax of 1 percent of the value of cars that cost more than 1 million rupees ($14,671). Foiled again. Aluminum foil, commonly used in middle-class kitchens, has become more expensive along with plastic bags, which are considered highly polluting. Jewel markups. The price of jewelry goes up \u2014 \"excluding silver jewelry other than studded with diamonds or other precious stones, namely ruby, emerald, and sapphire.\" Imitation jewelry will also be taxed at a higher rate. Energy-friendly appliances will cost less. Solar lamps are now tax-exempt. Buying a new home is easier. There are incentives for first-time homeowners. Nest eggs could shrink. There are new penalties for retirement fund withdrawals above a certain amount. Some technology will be cheaper. Routers and set-top boxes for TVs that change an analog signal to digital will be taxed at a lower rate. Broadband modems and digital video recorders will also cost less owing to tax cuts. And some won't. E-reading devices will get pricier. Folk festival. Hiring a folk artist performer will cost less \u2014 the hirer will pay a smaller tax. Presumably, this measure will encourage the traditional arts. Airplane tickets will cost more. Air travel will go up as part of a hike in the excise tax on jet fuel from 8 percent to 14 percent. Jet fuel accounts for some 40 percent of the operating costs of Indian carriers; airline stocks slumped at this news. Airline consultants complain that the hike goes against the government's stated objective of making flying more affordable for the masses. Cable cars will cost more, too. The cost of a ride \u2014 mainly for tourists \u2014 will go up because of a new 14 percent tax. A few more seemingly random tax increases. Taxes on packers and movers will go up. So will taxes on \"ready-made garments.\"",

Smith University on Sept. 8. Yet a visit to the school reveals that many of its students have much more mixed feelings on the election. With less than a month to go before Election Day, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are focused on locking up key battleground states. One of them is North Carolina, a state that Barack Obama turned blue in 2008, but lost in 2012. Over the course of this election season, Weekend Edition has been visiting Mecklenburg County, N.C., a blue county in a red state that's seen large demographic shifts over the past decade. Mecklenburg has a rapidly growing Hispanic population, 30 percent of its residents are black, and it has become a hub for banking and a booming tech sector. We've been talking with voters in Mecklenburg over the course of the year, and on our most recent visit, we focused specifically on black voters \u2014 a demographic targeted by both campaigns. For Clinton, getting African-Americans to the polls will be crucial to her success in the state. Johnson C. Smith University In a classroom at Johnson C. Smith University, a group of students is discussing how to encourage their peers to vote. They're part of a political science association that includes students and alumni. When we asked them about how they felt about Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton we heard some groans. \"I don't like the candidate choices we have,\" said Ayana Perry. She was supporting Sen. Bernie Sanders, but when he dropped out of the race she decided, \"I guess I'm with her.\" This is a historically black university, and polls show Donald Trump's support among African-Americans at between 2 and 6 percent nationwide. These should be Clinton's biggest supporters, but the people we spoke with were not enthusiastic. Jasmine Wright, an alumna in the room, said she feels bad for first-time voters. \"I feel sorry for their decisions.\" Ty Turner Bond Hillary Clinton has sent surrogates to Johnson C. Smith University. Ty Turner Bond, who said he's voting for Donald Trump. He says Trump's economic proposals appeal to him.\n                \n                    \n                    Natalie Winston/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Ty Turner Bond, who said he's voting for Donald Trump. He says Trump's economic proposals appeal to him. Donald Trump has been trying to attract black voters in his own way. At an August rally in North Carolina, Donald Trump made a pitch to minority voters by asking the question, \"What do you have to lose by trying something new?\" He's asserted that Democrats have taken the black vote for granted. Ty Turner Bond couldn't agree more. He was a Democrat for years. He even worked on President Obama's 2008 campaign. \"We had seven years of President Barack Obama, who looks similar to me, but I haven't seen any changes,\" Bond says. And that's why he's voting for Donald Trump. \"Every African-American does not think alike, every African-American does not walk alike,\" and so he makes the point, why should they all vote alike? Bond is not enticed by the Democratic platform. He likes Trump's economic proposals, like his plans to empower African-American entrepreneurs. Katrina Rodgers We met Katrina Rodgers at Antioch Road to Glory International Ministries, a predominantly black church where Rodgers' father is the pastor. Their church does not have nonprofit status, which is why they can take a political stance. When we asked Rodgers what about Donald Trump she liked, she talked about his skepticism on NATO and his rejection of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal. She told us that just because she has black skin doesn't mean she's going to vote for a Democrat. She also brought up a speech Hillary Clinton made in 1996 when she referred to young black men \"superpredators.\" Shaun Corbett Clinton's use of the word \"superpredator\" came up a lot in the course of our interviews. At Da Lucky Spot, a barbershop in Charlotte, owner Shaun Corbett had a different take. \"I'm a convicted felon,\" he told us, \"thoughts change, people change. So who am I to hold one thing that one person said at one time against them.\" Shaun Corbett and Cpt. Rob Dance at Da Lucky Spot, Corbett's barbershop in Charlotte.\n                \n                    \n                    Natalie Winston/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Shaun Corbett and Cpt. Rob Dance at Da Lucky Spot, Corbett's barbershop in Charlotte. He had an opportunity to sit down with Hillary Clinton and other community leaders in Charlotte just weeks before we interviewed him. He said he's supporting Hillary Clinton because she has a fire in her. \"She's been fighting for rights for women, black people, kids since the 1970s.\" It's fair to say that both of the candidates have used language in this election season and in the past that has upset black voters. On Oct. 20, early voting will begin at 10 sites in Mecklenburg County, N.C. That will be the first test of who is showing up at the polls. No doubt the campaigns will be watching closely to see how they can hone their messages in the few weeks left before Nov. 8.",

Lots of issues that affect Americans' daily lives will likely come up at Monday night's first presidential debate. Here's a cheat sheet of what to know about a host of issues of significance, from taxes and jobs to the military and immigration: Taxes Donald Trump wants to cut income tax rates while capping deductions for the wealthy. He would also reduce the business tax rate to 15 percent and eliminate the estate tax. The conservative Tax Foundation estimates that his plan would reduce federal revenue by $4.4 to 5.9 trillion over the next decade, which is a lot, but down from $10 trillion estimated from his original plan. Some of that could be offset by economic growth, but even using \"dynamic scoring,\" the foundation says the plan cuts tax revenue by $2.6 to 3.9 trillion over 10 years. (The higher figure is if the 15 percent business tax rate is applied to \"pass through\" entities.) Donald Trump's series of tax cuts and military spending could cost between $3 trillion and $6 trillion over a decade. Clinton's tax increases on the wealthy would bring in $1 trillion or more.\n                \n                    \n                    Domenico Montanaro/Scott Horsley/NPR/Tax Foundation/Tax Policy Center\n                    \n                \nhide caption The biggest beneficiaries of Trump's tax cuts are the wealthy. The top 1 percent of earners see their after-tax income rise by between 10.2 and 16 percent. Overall savings would be less than 1 percent. Hillary Clinton would raise taxes on the wealthy, especially those making more than $5 million per year (two out of every 10,000 people), limit the value of certain deductions and increase the estate tax and make more people pay it. Currently, only estates worth $5.5 million or more pay taxes on inheritance. Clinton would lower that threshold to $3.5 million per person and $7 million per couple. On Thursday, Clinton proposed raising the estate tax from 40 to 45 percent. For estates worth $500 million for a single person and $1 billion for a couple, it would go up to 65 percent, the highest rate since the 1980s. Just 223 estates that were taxed in 2014 were worth $50 million or more. The rate is similar to the billionaire tax Clinton's Democratic primary rival Bernie Sanders proposed. Clinton's proposed tax increases could bring in up to $260 billion over 10 years. The Tax Policy Center estimates Clinton's tax plan overall would raise more than $1 trillion over a decade, with three-quarters of that coming from top 1 percent of income earners. Jobs Private-sector employers have added 15.1 million jobs since the trough of the recession in 2010. Unemployment, which peaked at 10 percent in October of 2009, has fallen to 4.9 percent. Unemployment among African Americans, which peaked at 16.8 percent in March of 2010, has also fallen to 8.1 percent, cut more than half yet still almost double the overall national figure. Unemployment among African American young people is not 58 percent, as Trump claims, but 26.1 percent. The highest average job growth in a presidency in the last 40 years was under Bill Clinton, at an average jobs gains of almost 2.9 million annually.\n                \n\n                    Domenico Montanaro/Scott Horsley/NPR/Paul Waldman, Washington Post\n                    \n\nhide caption For a comparison of past presidents: The strongest average yearly jobs gains for each of the presidents over the last 40 years \u2014 Bill Clinton (2.9 million), followed by Carter (2.6 million), Reagan (2 million), Obama (1.3 million, as of January), H.W. Bush (659,250), and W. Bush (160,125). Trump has made an anti-trade message the centerpiece of his jobs plan. Clinton came out against the Obama-proposed Asia trade deal. Clinton championed it as secretary of state, calling it the \"gold standard,\" but she backed away during her primary against Bernie Sanders. Trump has vowed to spend \"at least double\" Clinton's infrastructure plan, though he has not laid out specific details. That means Trump's infrastructure plan could cost north of half-a-trillion dollars. Clinton has proposed $275 billion in infrastructure spending over five years. Clinton is also proposing small-business tax cuts, investment in solar panels and scientific research. In addition to infrastructure spending, Trump's plan centers on the growth-power of tax cuts; reducing regulations, especially ones aimed at the coal and natural gas industry and waterways, including \"the smallest streams\"; scrapping the Paris Climate Agreement; lobbying TransCanada to reapply for a permit for the Keystone Pipeline; expanding oil drilling; expanding childcare options (that would be difficult to pay for); cracking down on crime; and, of course, doing away with Obamacare. Wages Last week, we learned that median family income finally rose last year \u2014 by 5.2 percent, the first real increase since the Great Recession. Adjusting for inflation, the median is still slightly below the pre-recession peak of 2007, and below the all-time high which was reached in 1999. All races saw gains last year, with Hispanics seeing a 6.1 percent increase, whites 4.4 percent, and African Americans 4.1 percent. Poverty The poverty rate fell 1.2 percentage points, or 3.5 million people, to 13.5 percent in 2015. Still, 43.1 million Americans were living in poverty. In Obama's first year in office, the poverty rate was 14.3 percent. It peaked at 15.1 percent in 2010. Some 45.7 million Americans were on food stamps (SNAP benefits) last year. In Obama's first year in office, there were 33.5 million. The number on food stamps peaked in 2013 at 47.6 million. Trade In 2015, the U.S. had a trade deficit with the rest of the world of $746 billion. In other words, the U.S. imports more than it is exporting. In the first seven months of 2016, the trade deficit was $424 billion. Much of that deficit is with one country \u2014 China. In 2015, the U.S. had a trade deficit with China of $367 billion. In the first seven months of 2016, it was $191 billion. So in both cases, the trade deficit is on pace to shrink, slightly this year. Obamacare The controversial health law, the signature legislative achievement of the Obama presidency, has pushed uninsured rate to an all-time low of just over 9 percent, while extending coverage to some 20 million people (including Medicaid expansion, exchanges, and young adults on family plans). The uninsured rate would be lower still had the 19 holdout states expanded Medicaid. Competition on the exchanges, though, is shrinking. Fewer insurance companies are playing, and 19 percent of exchange enrollees will have just one company to choose from in 2017. (That's up from 2 percent in 2016.) Some 62 percent of enrollees will still have at least three choices. The problem tends to be worse in rural areas and in the South. Premiums in the exchanges are on the rise. McKinsey Center looked at 18 states and found an average increase of 11 percent for the benchmark plan next year. Some of that increase will be absorbed by the federal government, as most exchange subscribers receive a subsidy. A study by the left-leaning Urban Institute found that even without the subsidy, exchange plans cost an average of 10 percent less than employer-provided coverage. Military Both Clinton and Trump want to lift the caps imposed on military spending by the Budget Control Act of 2011 (sometimes called the \"sequester.\") Clinton also wants to lift the corresponding caps on domestic spending, whereas Trump wants additional cuts in domestic spending to help offset the cost of his military buildup. Trump wants to grow the active-duty Army from 475,000 to 540,000 soldiers, increase the number of Marine battalions from 24 to 36 (4,000 to 10,000 Marines), increase the number of Navy ships from 280 (planned) to 350 and add dozens of additional fighter aircraft. The New York Times estimates Trump's plan would costs $80 to $90 billion per year. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget puts the pricetag of lifting the budget caps at $450 billion over the next decade (of which Trump's proposed offsets cover $300 billion at most.) For context, per the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, the Obama fiscal year 2017 budget calls for $590 billion in Defense spending, including $58.8 billion for overseas contingency operations or war-fighting. Adjusting for inflation, the overall defense budget is down 25 percent from the peak in fiscal year 2010, at the height of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. It's still about 12 percent higher in real terms than the average during the Reagan administration. (Excluding overseas contingency operations, the base defense budget is down about 11 percent from 2010, and roughly equal to spending during the Reagan years.) Defense spending amounts to about 3 percent of gross domestic product and 14.2 percent of total federal spending. (The Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments says defense as a percentage of GDP or federal spending is a poor yardstick for assessing defense needs, but a useful measure of affordability.) Immigration Donald Trump proposes increasing the number of Border Patrol agents from 21,000 to 26,000, which is actually less than the number proposed in the 2013 Senate immigration bill.\n                \n                    \n                    Domenico Montanaro/Scott Horsley/NPR/U.S. Border Patrol\n                    \n                \nhide caption The Border Patrol has doubled in size since 9/11 to more than 21,000. Trump has proposed adding about 5,000 more. The bipartisan Senate bill in 2013 would have gone further, to 38,000. Meanwhile, apprehensions at the Southwest border \u2014 a proxy for attempted crossings \u2014 have dropped by 79 percent from the peak in 2000. The Pew Research Center reports more Mexicans left the U.S. than entered between 2009 and 2014. For Central American immigrants, 122,000 families were apprehended in the first 11 months of the fiscal year, so on pace to match 2014 after a drop last year. The number of immigrants in the U.S. illegally was about 11.1 million, as of 2014. That number has stabilized, per Pew, since the end of the Great Recession. The decline in immigrants coming from Mexico has been offset by growth of immigrants from Asia, Central America and sub-Saharan Africa. Deportations increased during Obama's first four years in office, peaking in 2012 at nearly 410,000. Since then, deportations have been dropping, reaching a low of 235,000 last year. Since 2014, the administration has focused on deporting recent arrivals and criminals, with fewer deportations of long-time residents whose only crime was crossing the border. In all, about 2.8 million people have been deported under Obama. Nearly one-in-five visitors who overstay their visas are from Canada, more than twice the number from Mexico. The federal deficit has declined under President Obama from a high of $1.4 trillion in 2009 to $438 billion in 2015. It has crept back up to $616 billion in 2016 as a result of congressional action.\n                \n\n                    Domenico Montanaro/Scott Horsley/NPR/White House Office of Management and Budget\n                    \n\nhide caption Federal deficit The budget deficit during Obama's first year in office was $1.4 trillion or 9.8 percent of GDP. The deficit shrank in each subsequent year, bottoming out at $438 billion or 2.5 percent of GDP in 2015. (Thus Obama's line that he'd cut the deficit by three-fourths.) It's rebounded this (fiscal) year to an estimated $616 billion or 3.3 percent of GDP, as a result of tax cuts and spending passed by Congress last year.

Americans who endured the brutal 2007-2009 recession and slow recovery now are seeing an economic sunrise: Wages are up, jobs are growing and more families are lifting themselves up out of poverty. And yet, dark clouds are still hanging over millions of Americans. No set of sunny statistics can help an unemployed coal miner in Kentucky pay the mortgage. Upbeat wage data won't reassure a Michigan factory worker who is nervously watching robots replace his co-workers. In this election cycle, candidates are responding to voters' anger and anxiety about an economy that \u2014 yes, has improved dramatically \u2014 but still feels uneven and unfair to many. In this week's installment of an election-year series, A Nation Engaged, NPR reporters will be talking to people about what they are experiencing in this 21st century economy. Are opportunities drying up for middle-class Americans? What policies can help build sturdier ladders for those who want to climb up? An empty lot where a factory once stood in Springfield, Ohio. The city's population has declined about 27 percent since 1970.\n                \n                    \n                    Maddie McGarvey for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption An empty lot where a factory once stood in Springfield, Ohio. The city's population has declined about 27 percent since 1970. Much of the coverage will involve two cities in Ohio, a key swing state. There, Columbus and Springfield sit near the state's center, roughly 45 miles apart. Despite that proximity, their prospects have moved in opposite directions. Since 1970, Springfield's population has declined about 27 percent, while Columbus' has grown by about 57 percent. Springfield's paychecks have withered too. Between 1999 and 2014, median incomes fell an astounding 27 percent in Springfield, according to a recent study by the Pew Research Center. That study also found that in this century, the share of lower-income adults rose from 21 percent to 32 percent in Springfield. In contrast, Columbus has been booming. Last year, for example, it recorded the highest average hourly earnings gain \u2014 6.2 percent \u2014 in the entire country, beating out even San Francisco. A view of downtown Columbus, Ohio. Last year, the city recorded the highest average hourly earnings gain \u2014 6.2 percent \u2014 in the entire country, beating out even San Francisco.\n                \n                    \n                    Maddie McGarvey for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Before focusing on those two Ohio cities, let's get ourselves oriented. Here's the scene nationwide: In such an immense economy with 324 million people, you can always find a mix of hard times and good times. This year for example, farm incomes have been plunging and tech paychecks soaring. But overall, the economy is improving. A new U.S. Census Bureau report, released last week, showed that in 2015, U.S. incomes surged, rising 5.2 percent from a year earlier. After adjusting for inflation, median household incomes were up $2,800, to $56,500. That was the single biggest one-year jump since the Census Bureau started collecting that data in 1967. That's great news, but median household incomes are still 1.6 percent below the 2007 pre-recession level. And they remain 2.4 percent below the all-time high reached in 1999. The poverty rate in 2000 was just 11.3 percent. In 2015, it was 13.5 percent \u2014 meaning millions of people who used to be middle class are now poor. In fact, the wage squeeze has been so sustained that a Pew study done earlier this year found middle-income Americans are no longer in the majority. In 1971, about 2 out of 3 Americans lived in middle-income households. Today, less than 50 percent of households can be called middle income; a slight majority are either upper income or lower income. All of these numbers may leave you feeling confused, and that's understandable because much of it is conflicting. So here's what you can take away: The U.S. economy is in far better shape than during the Great Recession. Today, it has a record 5.9 million jobs open, a stable 4.9 percent unemployment rate and rising wages. But large swaths of Americans no longer are secure in the middle class. What about the future? Perhaps if the economy stays on track for a few more years, those insecure Americans will see better times. Optimists note that in the last two years, middle-wage jobs \u2014 at least those outside of coal country and the oil patch \u2014 have improved as employers have added carpenters, truck drivers, installers and such. Also, many state and local minimum wage laws have pushed up paychecks in the last couple of years. But pessimists fear the middle class is about to shrink much further. They point to employers' growing use of robots, artificial intelligence and other types of automation. Among the vulnerable workers may be truck drivers, bank tellers, cab drivers, secretaries, paralegals and assembly line workers. Join NPR and member station reporters as they explore questions about economic opportunities \u2014 and the policies that may help as new technologies and global trends continue to reshape the American workplace. Here are examples of efforts to help workers: More will be coming, but these are stories NPR already has offered. They help illustrate constructive approaches to increasing economic opportunities.

Donald Trump addressed a crowd in Fredericksburg, Va., on Saturday night, and discussed one of the new features apparent in his campaign. \"In recent days, across this country, I've asked the African-American community to honor me with their vote,\" Trump said. \"I fully recognize that outreach to the African-American community is an area where the Republican Party must do better.\" The need for better outreach by the Republican Party and its nominee to African-Americans has been underscored as Trumpmade this point in recent days to the overwhelmingly white crowds that show up to his rallies. \"The GOP is the party of Lincoln, and I want our party to be the home of the African-American vote once again. I want an inclusive country, and I want an inclusive party,\" Trump said in Virginia. The challenge Trump has in reaching out is also apparent in his poll numbers. African-Americans represent a reliable voting bloc for Democrats, but Trump's poll numbers with black voters are low \u2014 even for a Republican nominee. Exit polls from 2012 showed Mitt Romney winning just 6% of African-Americans, while President Obama won 93% of the black vote. An ABC News/Washington Post poll this month showed Trump with just 2% of support among black voters. Trump seemed to refine his pitch on Saturday. Earlier in the week, Trump was criticized for using sweeping generalizations to make the case for African-American voters to pull back support for Democrats. \"What do you have to lose? What do you have to lose? You're living in poverty, your schools are no good. You have no jobs \u2014 58 percent of your youth is unemployed,\" Trump said on Friday in Dimondale, Mich., a mostly white community near Lansing. \"What the hell do you have to lose?\" Trump has made generalizations along these lines before. Politifact recently rated that claim about black youth unemployment mostly false, finding the jobless rate for African-Americans ages 16 to 24 was just under 19 percent. That's more than double the rate for whites in the same age group, but far less than the figure Trump used. Trump also took his message to West Bend, Wisconsin, last week. It's a mostly white town 40 miles from Milwaukee, the racially-divided city where protests had broken out after police shot and killed a black man just days before. \"The main victims of these riots are law-abiding African-American citizens living in these neighborhoods,\" Trump said in West Bend. For months, Trump has argued that he has \"tremendous African American support.\" In Michigan on Friday, he told the crowd, \"At the end of four years, I guarantee you that I will get over 95 percent of the African-American vote. I promise you.\" Democratic strategist Jamal Simmons, who is African-American, called the idea of Trump getting a large share of the black vote a \"pipe dream.\" \"Black voters are still looking at what he says about Mexicans. And we know that once you start identifying people by racial group \u2014 or Muslims by religion \u2014 you start that circle it tends to come back around and smack black voters in the face pretty quickly,\" Simmons said. GOP strategist Ron Christie, who's also African-American, suggests Trump start by spending more time in black communities. \"All black folks aren't in jail. All black folks aren't on welfare. All black folks aren't poor. But Republicans, I think, have made the mistake of putting the largely African-American messaging in terms of crime, poverty and welfare rather than talking about empowerment, self-sufficiency and achieving the American dream,\" Christie said. And whether Trump's message is really aimed at black voters raises skepticism from Jamal Simmons, who said this rhetoric might be an attempt at softening the racial overtones of Trump's campaign to draw more support from suburban white women. \"Those voters are primed to vote for a Republican, but they don't necessarily want to be associated with someone who has racist or bigoted views,\" Simmons said. While white voters make up the overwhelming majority of Trump's supporters, the GOP nominee will take his message to a majority-black community this week. He's holding a campaign rally in Jackson, Miss., on Wednesday.",

Painting a grim picture of America, Donald Trump promised to protect the country and restore \"law and order\" by putting \"America First\" in his address Thursday evening formally accepting the GOP nomination for president. \"Americans watching this address tonight have seen the recent images of violence in our streets and the chaos in our communities,\" Trump said. \"Many have witnessed this violence personally, some have even been its victims. I have a message for all of you: the crime and violence that today afflicts our nation will soon \u2014 and I mean very soon \u2014 come to an end. Beginning on January 20th 2017, safety will be restored.\" Safety and security at home He put the responsibility for recent unrest \u2014 both domestically after the shooting of police and internationally with the growing threat of terrorism \u2014 squarely on the shoulders of President Obama and presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. \"This is the legacy of Hillary Clinton: death, destruction, terrorism and weakness,\" Trump thundered. \"But Hillary Clinton's legacy does not have to be America's legacy. The problems we face now \u2013 poverty and violence at home, war and destruction abroad \u2013 will last only as long as we continue relying on the same politicians who created them. A change in leadership is required to change these outcomes.\" A big way to do that came in a familiar refrain for Trump \u2014 building a border wall along the Southern border with Mexico to keep out illegal immigrants. The first night of the convention heavily featured mothers whose children had been killed by immigrants in the U.S. illegally, and Trump circled back to that theme as chants of \"Build the wall!\" rang out. \"To make life safe in America, we must also address the growing threats we face from outside America: we are going to defeat the barbarians of ISIS,\" he promised. \"America is far less safe \u2013 and the world is far less stable \u2013 than when Obama made the decision to put Hillary Clinton in charge of America's foreign policy,\" Trump said, as one of the most familiar refrains of the convention rang out \u2014 \"Lock her up!\" \u2014 convention-goers' own indictment of the Democrat's actions in Benghazi, Libya, and her secret email server. But Trump waved off the crowd, and instead told them, \"Let's defeat her in November, okay?\" The crowd roared.

Believe me.\" It was an unusual declaration in a GOP crowd \u2014 especially one that just passed a platform that moved to the right on gay rights \u2014 but Trump didn't dwell on those social issues, saying instead, \"I have to say as a Republican it is so nice to hear you cheering for what I just said. Thank you.\" Trade and \"Americanism, not globalism\" The billionaire real estate mogul also repeatedly cast himself as a champion for blue-collar workers and the middle class and advocated rolling back trade deals. \"Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo,\" Trump said. \"As long as we are led by politicians who will not put America First, then we can be assured that other nations will not treat America with respect. The respect that we deserve.\" Trump doubled on his promises to provide tax relief for business and renegotiate trade deals, ushering in more protectionist policies that are not typically hallmarks of the GOP platform \u2014 and that his own running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, has opposed. \"I am going to bring our jobs back to Ohio and Pennsylvania, and New York, and Michigan, and all of America,\" Trump said, ticking off several Rust Belt swing states he hopes his populist pitch can appeal to, \"and I am not going to let companies move to other countries, firing their employees along the way, without consequence. Not going to happen anymore.\" \"My opponent, on the other hand, has supported virtually every trade agreement that has been destroying our middle class,\" he continued, contrasting his positions with those of his Democratic opponent and former President Bill Clinton. \"Every day I wake up determined to deliver for the people I have met all across this nation that have been neglected, ignored, and abandoned. I have visited the laid-off factory workers, and the communities crushed by our horrible and unfair trade deals,\" Trump said. \"These are the forgotten men and women of our country \u2014 and they are forgotten. But they're not going to be forgotten long. These are people who work hard but no longer have a voice. I am your voice,\" he said to thunderous applause.

We Will Make America Proud Again. We Will Make America Safe Again. And We Will Make America Great Again,\" he concluded, echoing the theme of this campaign. The Clinton campaign quickly responded, condemning Trump's acceptance speech as \"a dark picture of an America in decline\" that would foster \"more fear, more division, more anger, more hate.\" \"He offered no real solutions to help working families get ahead or to keep our country safe, just more prejudice and paranoia. America is better than this. America is better than Donald Trump,\" Clinton campaign Chairman John Podesta said in a statement. \"Next week in Philadelphia, Democrats will focus on issues, not anger. We'll offer a positive vision for the future based on lifting America up, not tearing Americans down.\" \"Make America One Again\" theme on last night Trump was introduced by his eldest daughter, Ivanka, who spoke of how her father taught her the construction business and how to treat employees. \"My father has not only the strength and ability necessary to be our next president, but also the kindness and compassion that will enable him to be the leader this country needs,\" she said.

He recognizes real knowledge and skill when he finds it,\" Ivanka said. \"He is colorblind and gender-neutral. He hires the best person for the job, period.\" One of her most rousing lines was a call for better family leave policies for women \u2014 typically Democratic talking points. \"Women are paid equally for the work that we do and, when a woman becomes a mother, she is supported, not shut out,\" Ivanka said to loud applause. \"Gender is no longer the factor creating the greatest wage discrepancy motherhood is,\" she continued. \"As president, my father will change the labor laws that were put in place during a time in which women were not a significant part of the workforce and will focus on making quality child care affordable and accessible for all.\" The billionaire businessman's address comes after three days of a chaotic Republican National Convention to officially launch his general election, where he trails rival Hillary Clinton in polls. On Day 1, anti-Trump delegates caused a commotion when they tried to force a roll call vote to try to unbind delegates. And on Wednesday, Trump's former rival Ted Cruz took the stage, only to be booed off after the Texas senator still declined to endorse Trump. Thursday's festivities kicked off with a more energized mood and, for once, most stuck to the theme of the night, \"Make American One Again.\" Balloons fall from the ceiling to mark the conclusion of the Republican National Convention.\n                \n                    \n                    Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption South Carolina African-American pastor Mark Burns turned the decibel level up in the arena early, leading the crowd in chants of \"All Lives Matter!\" \"Even though I disagree with the tactics and the divisive rhetoric of the Black Lives Matter movement, I do understand that hopelessness and lack of opportunity breeds this type of desperation,\" Burns said, explaining what he believes is responsible for the current unrest in the country after police shootings in Dallas and Baton Rouge, La., along with the deaths of young black men in Louisiana and Minnesota. And other speakers deviated from the typical GOP orthodoxy on key points, particularly Silicon Valley tech investor Peter Thiel. \"I am proud to be gay. I am proud to be a Republican. But most of all, I am proud to be an American,\" Thiel said, getting cheers from the culturally conservative audience. \"I don't pretend to agree with every plank in our party's platform. But fake culture wars only distract us from our economic decline.\" Liberty University President Jerry Falwell Jr. and Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio both spoke earlier in the evening. Falwell, an influential evangelical voice who gave Trump his blessing early on, praised Trump as \"America's blue-collar billionaire.\" Arpaio, a famed immigration hard-liner, praised Trump's border wall, telling the crowd, \"We need a leader who will protect our border and enforce our laws because a nation without borders is a nation without laws is no nation at all.\"",

            "article_content": "House Speaker Paul Ryan is spearheading the agenda project, which he calls \"Confident America.\"\n                \n                    \n                    J. Scott Applewhite/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption House Speaker Paul Ryan is spearheading the agenda project, which he calls \"Confident America.\" House Speaker Paul Ryan shot down reports Wednesday that he was on the verge of endorsing Donald Trump for president. \"I don't know where all this came from. I haven't made a decision,\" Ryan told reporters. \"I don't have a timeline in my mind and I have not made a decision and nothing's changed from that perspective.\" The speaker added that he and the expected GOP nominee were still have \"productive conversations.\" Throughout the GOP presidential primaries, Ryan has tried to walk a line \u2014 between candidates and sometimes inflammatory rhetoric and trying to manage the party's message and vision from his perch as speaker of the House. He's done so in a series of speeches and public appearances, and those efforts sparked speculation that Ryan was planning a dark-horse campaign of his own for the nomination at a potentially contested convention. That's something he had to personally, and publicly, deny in April. He is, however, continuing his efforts to try and shape the narrative of 2016 and the message for Republicans. In an effort to hold their majority and reassure Republicans still wary of the party's presidential nominee, House Republicans will begin rolling out a policy agenda of their own in June. \"This isn't a legislative agenda for 2016, because Barack Obama is president. This is a legislative agenda for 2017 with a new president,\" Ryan said Wednesday, adding that he was hopeful it would be a Republican president and a Republican-controlled Congress. Ryan is spearheading the agenda project, which he calls \"Confident America.\" He previewed the agenda at a media briefing on Wednesday. House Republicans will unveil proposals on a weekly basis for the month of June that address the economy, taxes, national security, healthcare, poverty, and reasserting congressional authority. The latter is in response to President Obama's use of executive orders to enact policy changes. Ryan said the first week's roll out will include the GOP's agenda on how to combat poverty, an issue that the speaker has personally pushed to the forefront of the agenda project. Ryan announced the project shortly after he became speaker last fall, and well before Trump had locked up the nomination. But now the effort is widely viewed as an alternative agenda for congressional Republicans to campaign on this November. It will, in theory, allow lawmakers to run with Trump on the ideas they agree on, and be able to demonstrate where they differ. Trump has upended years of conservative orthodoxy with his support for higher taxes, opposition to free trade, embrace of entitlements like Medicare and Social Security, and his more isolationist foreign-policy views. Ryan stands in stark opposition to Trump on all of those positions. He has not yet endorsed the apparent GOP nominee, although the two men met privately this month to begin what both sides describe as an effort to unify the two wings of the party they represent. \"Look, we're a big tent party with lots of different wings of the Republican Party and we clearly come from different wings of the Republican party. There's no two ways about that,\" Ryan said, \"The question is if we're going to unify, can we figure out what is the common foundation that ties all those wings together and that's what we're working on.\" But in a Web video released Wednesday, Ryan criticized the \"bitterness in our politics\" and said politicians need to focus on policy solutions and not personal attacks. \"Leaders need to say: 'Here's my principle; here's my solution,'\" he says in the video. \"And let's try and do it in a way that is inclusive, that's optimistic, that's aspirational, that's focusing on solutions.\" He adds, \"Republicans lose personality contests anyway. We always do. But we win ideas contests. We owe you that choice.\" Lawmakers and aides familiar with the House GOP agenda project say it will hold to more familiar conservative positions on taxes, health care and foreign policy. House leaders have promoted similar efforts in the past. In 2006, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., led the \"Six for '06\" agenda that pledged to clean up a U.S. House dogged by ethical and criminal scandals. Democrats took control of the House that November. In 2010, House Minority Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio, led the \"Pledge to America\" that was geared toward capturing the economic angst and Tea Party anger of the time. Republicans took control of the House that November. But both of those elections were midterms, and in a presidential election year the party's nominees set the terms of the election in a way that is hard for any down-ballot candidates to drown out or escape on their own. In direct contrast to Ryan's call, Trump has led a personality-driven primary campaign and, so far, plans to run a similar strategy in the fall against Hillary Clinton. His early attacks on her have focused on Bill Clinton's past infidelities and her low approval ratings.",

            "article_content": "We'll hear conversations from Appalachia \u2014 the mountain region that stretches from New York to the Deep South. This remains a region where incomes lag well behind the national average.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: And we are in Knoxville, Tenn. We're asking how where you live affects how you vote and how you see the world. And today, we have the view from Appalachia, the mountainous stretch from New York to the Deep South. We're before a live audience at Holly's Gourmet's Cafe. Folks, will you let the country know you're here? UNIDENTIFIED CROWD: (Cheering). INSKEEP: And that may have broken the microphone. We could be done. You know, we came here after a road trip through the mountains. And we began at a distinctive place where we got to do a special thing - stand in the middle of the street in traffic - anything for the news. Let's listen. You've got to do this once in your life. I'm standing on the center line of a street - State Street here in Bristol. I've got one foot in Virginia and one foot in Tennessee because the state line runs down the middle of the street. Bristol straddles the border of Virginia and Tennessee. It's a tourist attraction - home of the Birthplace of Country Music Museum - also the home of Uncle Sam's Loan Office, which is a pawn shop. The owner, Cheryl Brown, described the local economy as she sees it. CHERYL BROWN: My dad always said when the economy was bad, our business was better. But I disagreed with that a little bit, saying, well, if the economy's bad, yes, they come in the store because they need money. But if they don't have the money to shop here - we have to replenish, you know? I sell a ring up there, I loan the money out back here. It's - we're called the poor man's bank. INSKEEP: People bring in jewelry, guns, shiny guitars - also tools and tool belts - the sort of items somebody once used to make a living. They give them as collateral for loans. BROWN: It's a sad thing. We see people that are addicted, to people that are - just lost their jobs. Somebody - he works 40 hours a week. His wife's home with the baby. His alternator went out. These are the stories we get. And that's why we're here to help people. INSKEEP: If people fail to pay the interest rates and fees, which total 20 percent after one month, the items go up for sale. We watched a man pawn a knife for eight bucks. Brown only give him that much because it was made in China. She says the local economy has improved since the financial crisis around 2008, but incomes lag behind the national average. What concerns do you have more broadly about the country and the direction it's going in right now? BROWN: (Laughter) I guess you'll be able to tell who I'm for by what I say. We need a shakeup. INSKEEP: The pawnbroker favors Donald Trump. He's won Republican primaries in numerous states in the Appalachian region, including New York just this week. So let's talk about this with Chris Green. He directs Appalachian studies at Berea College in Kentucky, which is one of the really famous institutions in this region. Good morning. CHRIS GREEN: Good morning. INSKEEP: Obviously, Trump has support across the country. But does his message resonate in a special way in Appalachia? GREEN: I think that it resonates in a way that has to do - on the surface, perhaps, people might think that these are people who don't feel spoken to. They may feel like President Obama is not doing what he needs to do. But the roots of it go back to the 1980s, with the beginning of the collapse of the industries in the area - the collapse of the coal economy, which lost over 20,000 jobs in the 1980s; another 20,000 in the 1990s. And what people feel is a loss of their identity and working-class power. INSKEEP: Well, that's a good point. Let's follow up on that with a Republican voter who's not for Trump, by the way. His name's Ralph Slaughter (ph). He's a bearded veteran. He's bought guitars and guns at that pawn shop in Bristol, by the way. He said factories and even universities have closed in his area. RALPH SLAUGHTER: We traded in 10, 12, 15-dollar-an-hour jobs for seven, eight-dollar-an-hour jobs. And employment - there is none. Go up and down every street you want to choose, and look at how many houses are for sale and how many apartments are for rent. The whole damn place is selling out. INSKEEP: You know, he's concerned about factories closing. And I think there's an opportunity to make a point here that a lot of people might not realize. It's a mountainous region. It's a mostly rural region. But what industries are here? GREEN: Well, their industries are plastics. There's industry in petrochemical. There's industry in radios. Some of the best radios in the nation are made in Tennessee. The places that we think of as where antifreeze came from - that was developed in Appalachia. Appalachia is filled with industry. INSKEEP: And does all of this mean that questions about trade and free trade resonate here especially? GREEN: Tremendously. Tremendously - it's another version of the Rust Belt. INSKEEP: We were in a city just the other day that used to have a furniture mill. I guess a lot of them are gone. GREEN: They are indeed. INSKEEP: Well, we're digging into the region's problems, but I do not want to forget John Garrett. He is a farmer outside the tiny Appalachian town of Damascus, Va., where there was a furniture factory once upon a time. Just listen as Garrett put us in his SUV and started driving overland across a field, around some cows, and up the side of a steep ridge. JOHN GARRETT: You know, this is passable, I promise you. Just hang on. You may wish to close your eyes. INSKEEP: We did not wish to close our eyes because of the view of a mountain valley. GARRETT: OK, OK - now, to me, this is the Appalachian area right here - open land, rolling hills, the mountains and a little bit of peace and quiet. INSKEEP: And it's about as beautiful as any spot you'd find. GARRETT: Beautiful country - beautiful. INSKEEP: There's a lot of poverty here, sure, but people feel attached to this place. And Garrett, by the way, has a family burial plot on his land. Some people go to great lengths to move to Appalachia. Garrett's son-in-law, for example, lost his job a little further east as a biologist. Adam Woodson is his name. He and his wife vowed to move to Damascus, Va., which was not easy. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) INSKEEP: We need to hear from Adam Woodson, there we go. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) INSKEEP: Adam said, we knew where we wanted to live, but there was no way to live down here. He said he job searched for about three years - was finally thinking, if he's going to work, he needs to work for himself because nobody is going to hire him to do anything at a decent wage. So what did he do? He started the Damascus Brewery, a tiny operation. Its slogan is, the best dam beer in Damascus - D, A, M. We watched him grinding barley on a homemade contraption run by a motor salvaged from a washing machine. He's making it work. He's part of this former mill town now that has remade itself as a tourist stop. It's a destination on the Appalachian trail. And as we were there, sunburned hikers were walking through town. Maybe they'll buy a beer. Appalachia is a region rich in history that's looking to improvise a future and looking for leaders who can help. Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "Source: NPR Credit: Victoria Sarno Jordan The Goats and Soda team is playing a game, and one of us pulls out a bright red card with this line: \"Angelina Jolie will now be a special envoy for ____.\" Each team member shuffles through a handful of white cards and picks an answer to fill in the blank. This is what we get: \"Explaining that Chad is a country, not a person\" \"China!\" \"Antimalarial-induced hallucinations\" \"George Clooney's wife\" Now comes the fun part. Which card do you choose? We're playing Jaded Aid, a cheeky card game made by and played by humanitarian workers. Modeled after the fill-in-the-blanks party game Cards Against Humanity, it satirizes the mindset and mumbo-jumbo of aid and development. \"The game provides a venting mechanism for a lot of the wide-eyed young development workers who really do want to make a difference,\" says Teddy Ruge, one of the co-creators of Jaded Aid. \"But they run up against these systems that won't let them move as fast as they want to move.\" He knows what that's like. Ruge is a writer and entrepreneur who's started an agriculture business, a collaborative workspace and a mobile payment app in his home country of Uganda. With cards like \"an unpronounceable acronym,\" \"a vial of Bono's tears,\" \"saving Africa one adoption at a time,\" and \"giving up any hope of a stable relationship,\" the 200-card deck shines a light on aid stereotypes, gets real about living in the field and pokes fun at jargon. And depending on your personal sensitivities, the cards could be offensive or NSFW. If you've never had to deal with the U.N., raise awareness for a disease no one's heard of or get a sixth round of approval on a climate change communique, you may need Google to guide you through the references. \"The whole deck was designed as an inside joke for the international development community,\" says Wayan Vota, another co-creator, who, like Ruge, works in global development. \"Even the logo \u2014 it's actually the red and blue from the official USAID branding guide.\" Last September, the creators, Ruge and Vota and Jessica Heinzelman set out to to raise $12,000 to develop and print the game in a Kickstarter campaign. They blew past the mark within 48 hours and ended up raising $51,000 from more than 1,600 backers. And while they were funding the project, more than 2,500 people submitted their own card ideas. Many were based on real-life experiences, like \"an iPhone at the bottom of a pit latrine.\" \"We were shocked. We thought we'd go to the wire on financing it,\" says Ruge. \"But then we were like, now what? This is actually real. We have to print these cards now and ship them.\" So far, they've shipped and sold decks \u2014 available on their website for $19 \u2014 to aid workers, global researchers and expats in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Myanmar and beyond. If you live outside the realms of a \"functioning postal system\" as they put it on their website, you can download a PDF copy of the game and print your own cards for free. Many who play Jaded Aid find it cathartic. Manpreet Singh, a project manager for Dalberg, a global consulting firm, tried a round with a group of development workers in Nairobi, Kenya. \"We played it for an hour or two after brunch and it was great,\" he says. \"It's a fun way of talking about the cynicism and frustrations you face. Now we want to add our own cards.\" Ben Lyon, who works in a tech-startup in Hanoi, Vietnam, says \"It gives you artistic license to make fun of the things that otherwise depress you. It forces you to talk about things you otherwise might hold inside. And when you play with kindred spirits, you realize you all have similar opinions.\" But not everyone's a fan. \"Occasionally we get the school marm who says things like, 'I can't believe you're saying such naughty things about our industry. People outside the industry are going to use this against us,' \" says Vota, who works for an aid organization based in Washington, D.C. But Vota and the other creators hope the opposite comes true: Aid workers will be inspired to bring about change. \"Hopefully people play Jaded Aid at night, and the next morning wake up and say, You know what? Let me think about that,\" says Vota. \"That really hit on some issues that we should be dealing with today in the bright light of the morning sunshine.\" And what global development issues could he mean? \"Propagating heinous American stereotypes\" \"Ending peace and harmony by introducing democracy and elections.\" \"Pleasing the donor at any cost.\" Pick a card, any card!",

            "article_content": "President Obama returns to the campaign trail to urge people to vote for Hillary Clinton in the crucial battleground state of Pennsylvania.  AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: Hillary Clinton was at home for a second straight day. Her campaign says she's trying to recuperate from pneumonia. In the meantime, she's getting help from some high-profile surrogates. President Obama headlined a voter mobilization rally for her in Philadelphia this afternoon. NPR's Scott Horsley was there and sent this report. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: It is good to be back on the campaign trail. (APPLAUSE) SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: With the game clock winding down on his own time in the White House, President Obama was happy to play cheerleader today for the Democrat he hopes will take his place in the Oval Office. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) OBAMA: (Chanting) Hillary. UNIDENTIFIED CROWD: (Chanting) Hillary, Hillary, Hillary, Hillary... HORSLEY: In a tree-lined park near the Philadelphia Museum of Art, Obama said he wants Clinton to build on what he sees as the progress of the last eight years, the Paris climate agreement, the Iran nuclear deal and the ongoing economic recovery. Obama pointed to a new report from the Census Bureau today which showed the first real increase in median household income since the start of the Great Recession. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) OBAMA: Last year, across every age, every race in America, incomes rose, and the poverty rate fell. HORSLEY: Obama quickly added, there's more work to do. Many of his signature accomplishments could be reversed if a Republican wins the White House. So he's especially motivated to help Clinton follow in his footsteps. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) OBAMA: This is not me going through the motions here. I really, really, really want to elect Hillary Clinton. HORSLEY: The Clinton campaign is counting on Obama to help rally young voters. College student Kyle Richmond-Crossett came to the rally, along with a group of classmates from Swarthmore. KYLE RICHMOND-CROSSETT: I really was enthusiastic for President Obama and less so for Hillary Clinton. But I'll kind of do anything to stop Trump from being elected. HORSLEY: Obama can also help Clinton by boosting African-American turnout. Pollster and political scientist Terry Madonna of Franklin and Marshall College says that was one of the keys to Obama's own victories in Pennsylvania in 2008 and 2012, when he ran up huge margins in Philadelphia and the surrounding suburbs. TERRY MADONNA: Turnout, turnout, turnout mattered, sending the president to Philadelphian urban areas, where he's very, very popular. It's far more than a gesture for him to help gin up the turnout. HORSLEY: Three weeks ago, Madonna's poll showed Clinton leading Donald Trump in Pennsylvania by seven points. But since then, he says her lead here has shrunk, just as it has around the country. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) OBAMA: Do you mind if I just vent for a second? (APPLAUSE) HORSLEY: Obama complained today about what he calls frivolous media coverage, which has focused in recent days on how the Clinton campaign was slow to reveal her pneumonia diagnosis, as well as Clinton's comment at a Friday fundraiser that half of Trump supporters are deplorable. Obama argues Trump makes comments on a daily basis that would've disqualified previous candidates. He complains the news media largely glosses over those because the shock value's been dulled by sheer volume. Despite the third-degree Clinton's now getting from reporters and unforced errors of her own, Obama insists she'll bounce back. He learned about her resilience during their bitter primary battle eight years ago and later, when he asked Clinton to serve as his secretary of state. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) OBAMA: No matter how many times people knock her down and mess with her, she does not quit. She doesn't quit. (APPLAUSE) OBAMA: She doesn't quit. That's the Hillary that I know. HORSLEY: The president is expected to headline about a dozen of these campaign rallies for Clinton between now and November. First lady Michelle Obama will also be helping out, starting with a Clinton rally in Virginia on Friday. Scott Horsley, NPR News, Philadelphia. Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "This story was reported by Latino USA in collaboration with All Tech Considered. The audio version of this story aired earlier on Latino USA; it is embedded below. Micaela Honorato is looking from the sidelines as boys from her after-school program take turns racing their hand-made hovercraft on a dirt field in a city park. These remote-controlled cardboard devices are less \"hover\" and more \"skid-along,\" as the teacher Abraham Orozco puts it. Today, the middle-school kids are contending for the fastest spin around four traffic cones. Michaela is a tall 12-year-old with a serious and focused gaze. She quietly awaits her turn, then concentrates on the controls. At 16.36 seconds, she takes the lead in the competition. This after-school program is called HOLA \u2014 which stands for \"Heart of Los Angeles\" \u2014 and it serves the city's Rampart District, where nearly all residents live in poverty. Vast majority of HOLA's participants are Latino. Over nearly 30 years, the program has helped hundreds go to college. A handful of students from Orozco's scientific arts program at HOLA have pursued successful technical careers. But Orozco says a lot of his students shy away from the tech industry, despite technical talents: They don't want jobs with any economic risk \u2014 something quite common for work at a startup or in computer science in general. The leak in the pipeline It's even harder to get girls interested. At HOLA, younger kids don't get to choose their classes, but programs become elective for high-school students. Orozco's scientific arts program is \"girl-heavy\" in elementary and middle school, he says. At the high-school level, only two of his 13 students are girls. And this is one of the clear leaks of the talent pipeline that feeds workers to the tech industry. Year after year, Silicon Valley companies have been criticized for their slow process in employing more women and other underrepresented groups, which for tech are black and Latino. And often, they say they simply can't find enough qualified workers to hire. As you go through the tech talent \"pipeline\" to find where it leaks, HOLA illustrates a major one. Somewhere between middle school and high-school graduation, girls' interest in tech peaks and wanes. Down the line, women make up roughly half of U.S. workers and of the U.S. population \u2014 but on average represent less than a third of tech companies' employees. For black and Hispanic workers, the numbers drop into single-digits: These groups tend to comprise 3 percent or less of tech companies' employees. And it's not just technical fields, but all staff and leadership roles. The MySpace gateway Attempting to reverse-engineer interest in tech, we asked women in a Slack group called \"Techquer\u00eda\" for Latinos in tech: How did you first get into it? I like to think about it as, I walked in the back door, so that I could open the front door for everybody else. Raquel V\u00e9lez, on being a Latina in tech A surprising number of women replied: MySpace. The now-arcane social network allowed for a lot of customization \u2014 users could mess with the color schemes, fonts, add bells and whistles by tinkering with the source code. The site's popularity in the mid-2000s introduced many middle- and high-school girls to basic HTML. Dalia Icedo was the queen of cool MySpace designs: She got so good at customizing profiles that she created a whole separate page where other people could get her themes. \"I would change the color scheme literally every day, probably,\" she says, \"because I was 12, I had nothing else to do.\" The skills came in handy after high school, when she started an online shop to sell things like band pins and earrings \u2014 and began tinkering with visuals that bugged her, like margins that felt too wide. \"So I started to just go into the code and started to see a lot of the HTML and CSS that I had learned before. And then from there I just started to pick up JavaScript,\" says Icedo, who is in college and wants to become a UX (user experience) designer in Silicon Valley. \"It gave me a lot more confidence of being able to pick up coding.\" The consumer/creator breakdown Today, social media is no less popular than 10 years ago \u2014 and girls are more avid users than boys, especially on Snapchat and Instagram. But as technology has become more user-friendly, it's also become less customizable \u2014 even grandparents can use Facebook, but how many of us understand how it works? And talking with young girls, few are drawing the connection between using popular apps and thinking that they could program them. The number of women studying math and computer science in college peaked in the 1980s \u2014 even as overall, women receive the growing majority of bachelor's degrees. NPR's Planet Money podcast dug into this phenomenon, zeroing in on the year 1984: \"Personal computers started showing up in U.S. homes in significant numbers. These early personal computers weren't much more than toys. ... And these toys were marketed almost entirely to men and boys. This idea that computers are for boys became a narrative.\" Now, both the corporate marketers and the diversity activists have been trying to figure out the sensitive matter of how to market tech to girls. The line between \"girly\" and \"for girls\" can be thin. What matters is what girls can actually do with the technology, says Deldelp Medina, co-founder of Latina-focused accelerator Avion Ventures who's now at tech diversity nonprofit Code2040. A small pink computer isn't terrible per se, Medina argues: Smaller keyboards are actually nice to prevent carpal tunnel in smaller hands. What's insulting is if this computer comes with less processing power, memory or useful software than a regular one. \"There's a difference,\" she says, \"between wanting to celebrate your femininity and shrinking and pinking something.\" The mentorship challenge Targeting girls with technology can get thorny. But Andrea Guendelman, creator of Latinos-in-tech social network BeVisible, says one \u2014 if not the only \u2014 thing that works is mentorship. In the summer of 2014, Jazmine Fernandez was one of the young women in the Girls Who Code program. Being raised by a single mother and sisters, Fernandez knew there's little women can't do. But when she heard she got placed at Facebook, Fernandez felt intimidated \u2014 excited, but mostly scared. Women and everybody who's currently underrepresented in the tech industry has to gain those skillsets, because otherwise, it will not go well for any of us. Deldelp Medina, on the tech-worker shortage \"Because when I went, there was just a lot of...\" Her voice trails off. \"There was... How do I say this?\" Her mentor, Raquel V\u00e9lez, steps in: \"There weren't a lot people who looked like you, huh?\" Fernandez heard V\u00e9lez give a talk at Facebook headquarters, and she made a huge impression: Latinas can get jobs in Silicon Valley. \"One of my favorite quotes ever is, 'You can't be it if you can't see it,' \" says V\u00e9lez, engineering manager at software company NPM. \"Believe me, I have like 25 mentors, and it's the only way I can make it through, because so often I'm the only one.\" Fernandez is now studying computer science at San Francisco State University. She expects the field to always be a struggle. In one of her classes, a guy once basically tried to argue that girls can't code. And to be Latina in tech, V\u00e9lez says you have to work four times as hard. \"I like to think about it as, I walked in the back door, so that I could open the front door for everybody else.\" The end of the pipeline Where mentorship particularly comes into play is at the end of the pipeline, where underrepresented groups struggle to get hired and stay hired. Silicon Valley is a boys' club whose networks tend to stay white, male and affluent. One company trying to break the cycle is Atipica. It has built a computer program to sift through resumes \u2014 skipping human managers to avoid hiring biases, like subconscious discrimination based on a last name or school attended. Atipica's isn't the only resume-reading artificial intelligence. But often, algorithms reflect the biases of humans who write them. Atipica CEO Laura Gomez says her company specifically focused on designing an unbiased AI. (Neither Gomez, nor her clients, which include Slack, agreed to discuss how well Atipica's program works.) Chicago-based Opternative offers another example of tackling diversity head-on. It's a startup that lets people do their own eye exams. In many ways, Opternative operates like many other startups, relying on referrals from its existing employees. Yet it's grown into a pretty diverse group because from the get-go, its team wasn't just white guys and it views diversity of life experiences as an asset. The blind spot But here's the tricky part: While both companies get high marks for being racially diverse, gender equity remains a challenge. Atipica, a Latina-run company, has one other female employee. Opternative's technical team has women on the design side and in junior positions, but all four of its senior engineers \u2014 the leaders and decision-makers \u2014 are male. Gomez and Opternative CTO Ayo Jimoh say the women they've seen apply for their job openings were under-qualified for those positions. It's effectively the pipeline argument. Jimoh's diagnosis is that people self-select \u2014 they don't want to pursue careers that are stacked against them, they need role models, success stories of others like them. So then, who is responsible for creating those role models? Couldn't Jimoh or Gomez, for example, spend extra time to find a female senior engineer or promote from within? \"There is a part of me that says, let me me show,\" says Gomez, \"but I have to put my business first and foremost.\" Jimoh, too, says he has to balance that responsibility for equity with his other responsibilities \"to my company, to my team, to myself, to my family.\" In a way, the push for diversity in tech is still so new, it's often treated as a cause or a mission \u2014 and fighting for a cause and running a business aren't the same. At the end of the day, Atipica and Opternative weren't founded to heal Silicon Valley's diversity problem \u2014 but to fill what they see as a market need. And these are small companies \u2014 the gender balance of staff is even harder to shift at massive ships like Facebook or Google. A few companies, such as Intel and Twitter, have recently started releasing hiring goals, putting diversity in quantifiable terms. The targets are very far from lofty, but they're specific, public \u2014 presumably someone's measurable responsibility. The future of the economy And now, there's a new challenge. As Donald Trump takes over as president of the United States, diversity advocates are worried about a push against the very concept of promoting multiculturalism. \"I think we need to double-down on diversity and inclusion, quite frankly,\" says Daisy Dominguez-Auger, global head of diversity at Google. \"Companies are going to have to take a stronger look at what their practices are ... in a much more collaborative way.\" Fundamentally, the Trump administration's economic policy is expected to focus heavily on manufacturing jobs. One of the first conversations Trump had with a tech leader after the election, was a call with Apple CEO Tim Cook, in which Trump pushed for Apple to build plants in the United States. From what we know, Trump has yet to address the shortage of skilled tech workers. And many economists predict, that's a major challenge for the future of America: The economy of the future is one where almost everyone has to interact with computers and code. Diversity advocate Medina says sidelining large swaths of the population from the tech industry is no way to make sure America isn't left behind. \"We're going to have a jobs deficit that is so huge, that if we don't fill it, we're going to have severe economic consequences,\" she says. \"Women and everybody who's currently underrepresented in the tech industry has to gain those skillsets, because otherwise, it will not go well for any of us.\" Latino USA's Jeanne Montalvo, Noam Hassenfeld and Julia Shu contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Mayor Bill de Blasio this week pushed ahead with plans to make New York City one of nation's few big cities to offer free, full-day Preschool for all 3-year-olds\u00ad\u00ad. The plan, which would eventually serve more than 60 thousand children a year, builds on one of Mayor de Blasio's signature accomplishments of his first term: universal pre-K for 4-year-olds. Washington, D.C., West Virginia, Florida, Georgia, and Oklahoma already offer this. New York City's would be the largest. To achieve this ambitious goal the mayor will need significant help from the state and federal government worth upwards of 700 million dollars. And he faces the political tussles that will surely accompany his financing challenges. The mayor is running for re-election in 2017. But there is near universal consensus that high-quality pre-K programs can have a huge positive impact on the lives of children \u2013 especially low-income ones \u2013 as well as on the parents and family. That's the crux of the study The Life-Cycle Benefits of an Influential Early Childhood Program, co-authored by Nobel laureate James Heckman, a professor of economics at the University of Chicago and the director of the Center for the Economics of Human Development. There's a growing body of research on the value and importance of high-quality early education programs \u2014 especially for disadvantaged kids. But there's surprisingly little research on its impact over time. This paper helps change that. Heckman and his co-authors examine the many ways in which these high-quality programs helped participants thrive throughout life. The paper analyzes two North Carolina programs founded in the 1970s that worked with infants from 8 weeks old through age 5. The rub for researchers: The programs included data collection from birth through age 8 on a wide range of school and home life factors as well as long-term follow-ups through age 35. Quality early education programs are expensive upfront. But as Heckman argues, the returns are enormous; the investment well worth it. Your study found enduring positive effects of quality pre-K on a lot of things, including future earnings, health, IQ and crime reduction. Is the bottom line here stronger, fuller, richer lives? Yes it is, but it's more than just stronger, richer, fuller lives for the children. It's also stronger, richer, fuller lives for the mothers of the children. Let me explain why. In America today we have a lot of single-parent families. We have a lot of mothers who are working. What we've done is shown the benefits across two generations of the study of these enriched early child care programs. Not only providing child care for working mothers \u2014 allowing them to get more education \u2014 but primarily to get more work experience, higher earnings gains through participating in the workforce, but also getting high-quality child care environments that turn out to be developmentally rich. It promotes social mobility within \u2014 and across \u2014 generations. That I think is an important finding of this study. Tell us about the two programs you've studied, serving mostly lower-income, predominantly African-American families. The program starts very early. The children are 8 weeks old. It stays with the children until they're age 5. It's a program that runs nine hours a day, so it's very child care-friendly in the sense that women could leave their children at the child care center and then go on to work. They provide these disadvantaged children with enriched family environments: more verbal attention, more enrichment and parenting resources available to disadvantaged, predominantly African-American women, as you say, and single-parent women. It supplements the early lives. In addition, it gives health care screenings for children 0 to 5. The pediatrician has access to the treatment group. The pediatrician then would suggest what health indications should be taken. What kind of steps, what kind of treatment might be taken. Doesn't pay for the treatment but it does essentially screen the children and alert parents to the need for treatment. This is true wrap-around service and personalized attention? Yes. Turns out one of the most effective ingredients for these early child care programs is interacting with the child. What I mean by interacting is a give-and-take. The term that's used by the child development specialist is scaffolding, like building a sculpture \u2014 in this case of a human being. Staying with the child, taking the child to the next step, challenging the child. In that sense it's very personalized education. It's very time-intensive education, but it's education that stays with the child. It also has another effect, which is that it engages, through the enhanced stimulation of the child, the parent. Parents themselves visit the center, so that there is also stimulation of the parent-child relationship that lasts long after the program itself is formally ended at age 5. This kind of comprehensive program is more costly upfront? For sure. The main benefit of this study is, if you count all of the benefits that accrue from this program in terms of reduced health care costs, reduced crime, greater earnings, more education, higher IQ \u2014 the list is quite long. Those all are monetized. We can compute a rate of return, the dividend would be from the investment. You get about 13 percent per annum. Much higher than the annual return on equities in the U.S. stock market post-Second World War through the 2008 meltdown. Yeah I'd like 13 percent on my 401(k) every year. Exactly. This is a huge, huge investment return. It competes favorably with almost any other public program. What was the (annual) per-pupil spending while these children were in the program? Per-year it's probably about $16,000 to $18,000. It depends on what [year] dollars you use. It's expensive. That is pretty high. You're saying you get what you pay for? Well, yes, it's a lot. But what are you getting in return? You're getting hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars. Seven to eight hundred thousand dollars back for what is essentially an $80,000 to $85,000 expenditure. Yes, it costs more but we can go back and think: In its time the transcontinental railroad that Abraham Lincoln launched, the Hoover Dam, the transcontinental highway system that Eisenhower launched. These all were very costly, but they also led to enormous social benefits. These programs have enormous social benefit. They help to solve a lot of social problems. The way public policy is discussed frequently in this country is through silos. People say, \"We want to reduce crime. We want to promote health.\" We do what is, I think, a very limited kind of notion: looking at one problem at a time and one solution very closely linked to that problem. I would encourage people who see the price tag to also look at the benefit tag. They're well-documented. You followed these young people well into adulthood? That's the benefit of the study. The children in the study essentially are much healthier than their counterparts who did not participate in the study. That came as a surprise to some people, but it shouldn't be a surprise. Not only did they get the health screening, but they also developed these social and emotional skills: self-control, the ability to monitor. They had more education, therefore they had more information. In a number of ways these children became more engaged, control their own lives better, and that shows up in their adult health. What is turning out from this body of research is that promoting engagement of children, their cognitive and noncognitive skills, boosting their IQs, at the same time boosting their social engagement, their willingness to participate in society, monitoring their health from an early age, is having huge benefits downstream for the rest of their lives. You mentioned the return on investment. But you've also documented health benefits, crime reduction and parental benefits including boosted income and lower obesity rates. Talk about that a little. That's folded into what we have for a measure of the rate of return. You can actually monetize the cost of the criminal justice system, the cost of incarcerating people and so forth. You can also talk about the benefits of reduced health care expenditures, higher-quality of life and so forth. All of that's incorporated into our rates of return and benefit-cost ratio. Breaking out these components, one of the most surprising findings from a study that we did published in Science magazine a couple of years ago. We showed that children who are in this program were much less likely to be obese, to have hypertension, to have precursor environments that would promote diabetes. You mentioned the poisonous effect of the silofication \u2014 if we could call it that \u2014 in combating poverty. Looking at social challenges largely in isolation. This is also a hyper-partisan age. What do you think policymakers and politicians are missing when it comes to looking at early childhood education? Some leading politicians both Republicans and Democrats are not missing. They're well aware of it. What's really interesting is that if you go out to those red states that were called fly-over states in the last election, the ones in the Midwest and the ones that people frequently ignore. It's states like Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska, that have been some of the most vigorous in promoting early childhood development. The reason is that it's based on an economic efficiency argument and it also promotes what is an agenda that's frequently very common in some of those states about family values. It's really about helping bolster the American family, which I think is under attack, it's under transformation. It's simply that we have many more single-parent families. We have many more mothers who are working because they have to support their families. You've said the ultimate risk factor in the complex poverty equation is lack of parental engagement. Talk about that and what these programs you studied did in terms of parental engagement? It's not about getting toys that rotate or getting a particular program online to stimulate the kid. That can't hurt, but it's not the story. It's the engagement. It's \"Johnny or Sally, here let's look at this together, let's go to the zoo, let's look at this book, let's see what we're doing.\" It's that engagement. When you engage the parent in that process, you help them bolster their arrangement, then I think you actually will keep in place over the life of the child a very strong very beneficial environment. The center core is engagement. That's what good teaching's about too when you think about it. I don't think I'm saying anything that's revolutionary, but I do think I'm saying something that is frequently ignored in public policy. We think about a bricks-and-mortar approach to what education is about. That's exactly the wrong way to think about it. It's not a teacher lecturing to a student, it's basically the teachers or child care workers engaging students or engaging these young children and making age-adapted, person-adjusted interventions. I think that's the key. What do these programs have that helps foster that engagement? It turns out that many of the disadvantaged families have a mode of discouraging the child. Saying, \"Don't do this, don't do that,\" and on and on. The alternative is to actually have a family that encourages the child and supports the child in making mistakes and learning from mistakes, but also in engaging the child to explore the world. It's this attachment and this support that really plays a fundamental role I think in the structure of essential programs. That's an example where you would literally take the child, read to the child, engage the child, and then you would show the parent, bring the parent into the center. Show how successful the child has been and then send the child home. When the child goes home the child is more engaged and also therefore engaging the parent. We found that. We found that as a byproduct: much more parental engagement among those who got the treatment compared to those who were randomized out into the control group. And these were lifetime effects. If you look at disadvantaged children you'll find that they're getting about a third or a fourth as many words per hour as more advantaged children. The environments are fundamentally different. Over the lifetime, their young childhood \u2014 a period of say 0 to 5 \u2014 you're getting a millions of words deficit between those who are advantaged and those who aren't advantaged. That essentially is one way to close the gap. By literally reading to the child, by encouraging the child. As you know there's been a big emphasis on what constitutes high-quality child care centers. What elements are vital to create these great early learning centers? There's this enormous body of evidence talking about parent-child interaction. The structure of a successful [center] would be one that encourages those interactions, that fostered those. Are we talking about empathy? Well, yes, we're talking about empathy, and we're talking about the structure of engagement with the child, and at the core of successful programs is parenting. It's not so much having a pretty building. There's a whole mentality out there that says, \"We have a textbook notion about what constitutes a good school. The teachers must have a certain level of educational attainment.\" There have been a lot of studies, serious studies, that show that many of these so-called guides to what makes a good teacher \u2014 in terms of things like number of degrees or number of teacher credits and on and on and on \u2014 are really worthless in terms of predicting who's a good teacher. What is important is finding this empathy, this ability to work with people, the engagement. By empathy all I really mean is, you work with a child, you stay with a child, a child asks questions, you answer the questions. You don't discourage the questions and you promote them. At the same time you have a firm line where you say, \"Yeah that's a mistake. You could go do a little better,\" and so forth. We need a national empathy project, Professor Heckman. Probably could use it across the board and not just in early childhood!",

            "article_content": "President-elect Donald Trump said on the campaign trail that school choice is \"the new civil rights issue of our time.\" But to many Americans, talk of school choice isn't liberating; it's just plain confusing. Exhibit A: Vouchers. Politicians love to use this buzzword in perpetual second reference, assuming vouchers are like Superman: Everyone knows where they came from and what they can do. They're wrong. And, as Trump has tapped an outspoken champion of vouchers, Betsy DeVos, to be his next education secretary, it's time for a quick origin story. What are they? Think of traditional vouchers as coupons, backed by state dollars, that parents can use to send their kids to the school of their choice, even private, religiously affiliated schools. The money is all or some of what the state would have otherwise spent to educate the child in a public school. Often called scholarships, vouchers are most often reserved for low-income students, children with disabilities or for families zoned to a failing public school. Where are they? Fourteen states offer traditional student vouchers, according to EdChoice, a school choice advocacy group based in Indianapolis: Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Mississippi, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Utah, Vermont and Wisconsin, plus Washington, D.C. The idea has been making headlines since the early 1990s, when several hundred students first took part in the Milwaukee Parental Choice Program. What about separation of church and state? Ah, the old First Amendment. The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of vouchers in 2002, but many state constitutions still have what are called Blaine Amendments, which prohibit spending public dollars on religious schools. That's one reason the majority of states still don't offer traditional vouchers. What does the research say? \"Most studies find modestly positive or neutral impact on student scores, and that's generally limited to African-American students in large urban centers,\" says Micah Ann Wixom, a policy analyst with the Education Commission of the States. This 2007 Rand review of research found, as Wixom says, slight gains among students of color, but that the research \"has a number of weaknesses that preclude comprehensive and definitive answers.\" \"Do voucher students perform better than they would have in their neighborhood school?\" asks Josh Cunningham, a senior education policy specialist with the National Conference of State Legislatures. \"At the most I can say, 'Maybe, a little bit.' But there's not a lot of evidence that they'll have any substantial academic gains.\" Or, as the Center on Education Policy underscored in its 2011 survey of voucher research: \"Achievement gains for voucher students are similar to those of their public school peers.\" It's also possible, Cunningham and Wixom note, that vouchers can work in the opposite direction. Both point to recent research on programs in Louisiana and Ohio that found vouchers may have a negative impact on student achievement. What is Trump's plan? In a nutshell: Trump has pitched repurposing $20 billion in federal education dollars, distributing them to states as block grants. States can then pass the money on, as vouchers, to the nation's 11 million students who live in poverty. Trump has said he wants parents to be able to use these vouchers at the school of their choice, even if that school is private and/or religiously affiliated. What are the obstacles to Trump's plan? We already mentioned the fact that many state constitutions still have Blaine Amendments. That's Obstacle No. 1. It's not prohibitive, but a problem. No. 2: It's possible that many of those repurposed federal dollars would come from Title I, a long-standing federal program meant to send additional money to school districts that serve at-risk students. The problem there is, just a year ago Congress finally rewrote the big education law that sets the ground rules for Title I. It's hard to imagine the White House tapping this money without Congress cracking open the law and reworking the rules. And it's not clear there's enough appetite in Congress to do that. No. 3: In Trump's speech unveiling his ambitious choice plan, the then-candidate said this about its price tag: \"If the states collectively contribute another $110 billion of their own education budgets toward school choice, on top of the $20 billion in federal dollars, that could provide $12,000 in school choice funds to every K-12 student who today lives in poverty.\" Translation: Even if the Trump administration can scrape together $20 billion to pay for its voucher plan, that wouldn't begin to cover the full cost. Trump's plan would require states to kick in far more of their own money. And that will be tough, considering that as of 2014 35 states were still spending less overall per student than they were in 2008. The Great Recession put many state education budgets in a vise grip that has yet to loosen. No. 4: Finally, and perhaps most important of all: Vouchers are not universally popular, even among conservative voters. They may make a certain amount of sense in a large school district or a city where there are enough students \u2014 and established private schools \u2014 to support multiple choices. But schools in many small towns are closing or consolidating. They don't have enough students to support choice. For lots of rural parents, vouchers are more abstraction than alternative.  AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: Before the election, candidate Trump called school choice the new civil rights issue of our time, and his signature education proposal is a $20 billion school voucher plan. Again, traditional vouchers let parents use public money to pay for private schools, including religious schools. Now, for more on this, I'm joined by another member of the NPR Ed team, Cory Turner. Welcome to the studio. CORY TURNER, BYLINE: Thanks, Audie. CORNISH: So Cory, we just heard a lot from Eric about charter schools in Michigan but less about vouchers in part because Michigan doesn't allow for them. But vouchers are central to Trump's plan. So who has them, and how do they work? TURNER: Yeah, so they're in about 14 states plus Washington, D.C. - traditional voucher programs. Wisconsin really pioneered the idea in 1990, starting in Milwaukee. We've seen them in lots of other states - Florida, Ohio, Indiana. I think the most important thing to keep in mind is that generally these vouchers are limited to students in certain categories - first and foremost low-income students, sometimes students who are zoned to a failing public school and also students with disabilities. There's one interesting exception in Indiana, which also has one of the largest statewide voucher programs in the country. It's got about 34,000 students. Indiana has slowly been broadening access to its program beyond low-income kids to include some middle-class students. Although I should say that the higher their parents' income, the less money they get from the state. CORNISH: Now, I mentioned that quote from Donald Trump calling school choice the new civil rights issue of our time. Help us understand that terminology. TURNER: Yeah, so vouchers really took off as a big city movement, a conservative idea that crossed political lines because many African-American and Latino families who were really frustrated with their failing neighborhood schools - they liked the idea. That said, traditional civil rights allies like teachers' unions don't like them. They say they drain money from the public school system and that often vouchers don't really cover the full cost of private school tuition, which means that it's really not choice for a lot of low-income kids. The research on vouchers is really hotly debated. There's one 2007 overview of voucher research that found some positive results for African-American students. But there are also a lot of important caveats in that research. A more recent review from 2011 found voucher students doing roughly the same as public school kids, really no better. And some of the newest research frankly - we heard a little bit of it in Eric's piece there - out of Louisiana and Ohio both found some negative academic effects for voucher students. CORNISH: So what might be some of the obstacles to a national school voucher program? TURNER: There are actually several big ones, Audie. First in 2002, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that vouchers are constitutional, but a majority of states still have what are called Blaine Amendments which prohibit them from using state money to fund religious schools. There are a few other obstacles. The price tag on Donald Trump's plan is roughly $20 billion. It is not clear where that money would come from. Also, it seems like to get this done, they would have to crack open the very big federal education law that Congress passed last year and took a long time to come to agreement on. And I'm not sure that Congress is in the mood to do that. But maybe most important of all really is that vouchers are not universally popular even among conservative voters. They may make a certain amount of sense in a large school district or a city where there are enough students to support multiple choices. But if you think about it, in a lot of small towns - we've seen this on the Ed desk. In much of rural America, schools are closing or consolidating. There just aren't enough students to support choice. And for parents who live in these places, vouchers just seem like an abstract concept. CORNISH: That's Cory Turner of the NPR Ed team.

Japan has a limited safety net for the poor and the economy is still struggling to gain traction under Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.\n                \n                    \n                    Elise Hu/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption A Japanese mother and her 2-year-old pick up free groceries in Tokyo at the charity Second Harvest. Japan has a limited safety net for the poor and the economy is still struggling to gain traction under Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. In Japan, the world's third largest economy, the Brexit means more bad news for a country already struggling with its finances. Following the British vote to leave the European Union, the Japanese stock market on Friday saw the largest single day drop since the year 2000 (though it did rebound a bit on Monday). Japan's exports instantly became pricier \u2014 and less competitive \u2014 as the value of the Japanese yen soared. Japanese households, meanwhile, are still cautious about spending money needed that could help energize the economy. \"We need to take all possible measures to prevent this [Brexit] from affecting the Japanese economy,\" Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said at a news conference Monday. He didn't signal which measures Japan would take. It's dismal timing for Abe, who was elected in 2012 on an eponymous plan and promise \u2014 \"Abenomics\" \u2014 to revive the Japanese economy after years of stagnation. But the country faces stubborn headwinds: an aging and shrinking population, and climbing public debt. \"Three and half years on, the metrics are pretty dismal at this point, for Abenomics,\" said William Pesek, executive editor of Barron's Asia and the author of Japanization: What The World Can Learn From Japan's Lost Decades. \"The metrics initially were measured by the stock markets rising, by exports increasing and the hopes that companies would be increasing wages. We haven't seen that part of it, and it's kind of the problem.\" A standard basket of donated food that's available for pickup once a month for Japanese families in need, from the non-profit food bank Second Harvest.\n                \n                    \n                    Elise Hu/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption A standard basket of donated food that's available for pickup once a month for Japanese families in need, from the non-profit food bank Second Harvest. Feeling the pinch more than most are part-time workers, who don't get the guarantees of wages and benefits that full-time jobs offer. Limited Safety Net One Thursday a month, dozens of working-class Japanese line up under a train overpass to pick up a free basket of food. \"Seaweed, tea, sauce, biscuits in a can, emergency-type food,\" Michiko Sato shows us, as she digs through her basket. \"And dry curry.\" It's made possible by the Second Harvest, a non-profit national food bank. The government here doesn't provide much in the way of help for the working poor, since companies have traditionally employed people for life. Since that's changing, the stress of a bad economy has hit non-corporate employees like Sato especially hard. \"I feel like that's one of the biggest problems.There's only temporary jobs available to people like me,\" Sato says. She's working two of them \u2014 one as a cashier, and the other checking people into a gym. But it's not enough to feed her teenage son, and there are few places to turn for help. \"There's not a safety net here for people in need,\" says Charles McJilton, the founder and head of Second Harvest. \"And the non-profit sector here is still very, very small. I would easily say it's less developed than the Philippines, less developed than India.\" This leaves a whole segment of the Japanese population struggling to make ends meet. Many of them are single moms and children. Government statistics show 55 percent of single-parent households \u2014 most headed by women \u2014 live in poverty, defined in Japan as those with no more than about $9,900 in disposable income a year. That's one of the highest such rates in the developed world. \"Over time, it's become very difficult with this government to keep up with this problem and this trend,\" Pesek says. The mothers at the food bank pickup say they don't have time to consider the geopolitics involved. They just want to reliably feed their families. Tomomi, a 34-year-old mother who didn't want to share her full name because of the shame attached to poverty here, takes the subway from an hour outside Tokyo, with her 2-year-old strapped to her hip and dragging a suitcase to hold the food. \"The fact that we can come here and get good food, for free, at least once a month makes a huge difference in our ability to just get by as a family,\" Tomomi says. Facing Big Debts To help families get by, Japan did recently delay a planned increase in sales taxes, which would have hit the working poor harder than others. \"But they can't do that forever, because ultimately, Japan has a very large debt,\" said U.S. Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew, when asked about the state of Abenomics last month. \"They can defer bringing those taxes into place, but they need to use the space they create to put structural reforms into place at the same time.\" Structural reform includes ideas like encouraging entrepreneurship, loosening immigration restrictions and getting more women in the workforce. But doing those things to alter the structural makeup of Japan's economy is an arrow that hasn't quite flown. \"I would give it maybe a kind D minus, frankly,\" says Pesek.

Lieberman's hard-line positions and controversial remarks have ignited fierce debate in Israel and beyond.\n                \n                    \n                    Mahmoud Illean/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Avigdor Lieberman, who became Israel's new defense minister this week, visits Jerusalem's Old City on March 9. Lieberman's hard-line positions and controversial remarks have ignited fierce debate in Israel and beyond. After a week of intense negotiations, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu signed a deal Wednesday to bring the right-wing nationalist party, Israel Our Home, into an expanded coalition government. Under the agreement, party leader Avigdor Lieberman \u2014 a polarizing figure inside and outside Israel \u2014 will become defense minister, arguably the second most important job in the country after Netanyahu's own position. Israel's Maariv newspaper, right-wing itself, dubbed this Israel's \"most right-wing and extremist\" government in the country's 68-year history. While this designation is open to debate, Lieberman's appointment comes as growing nationalist policies are inflaming divisions within Israel and with the Palestinians. Who is Avigdor Lieberman? Lieberman, a secular, nationalist politician, grew up in the former Soviet Union and immigrated to Israel when he was 20. He became involved in politics early on, joining the rightist Likud before forming his own party, Israel Our Home (Yisrael Beyteynu), in 1999. The 59-year-old has long been known for extremist rhetoric, such as suggesting during the 2015 election campaign that Israeli Arabs who are not clearly loyal to the state should be beheaded. He has served in many government positions, including twice as foreign minister under Netanyahu. The two have had a fractious relationship but ran together on one ticket in the 2013 elections. Lieberman's core political base is the roughly 1 million Israelis who immigrated from the former Soviet Union, many coming in the 1990s. He demanded the defense minister's job as a condition for joining Netanyahu's coalition. Lieberman also negotiated additional money for poverty-stricken retirees. Why does Netanyahu want Lieberman's party in his government? The coalition government Netanyahu brought together after Israel's March 2015 election gave him the narrowest of majorities, 61 to 59, in the Knesset, Israel's parliament, which has 120 seats. Lieberman's party ups the government's majority to 65 votes in the Knesset. In Israel, much legislation is hammered out in the Cabinet \u2014 made up of coalition members \u2014 and members of the Knesset from those coalition parties are expected to endorse those decisions with their votes. Still, such a slim majority left Netanyahu with little room to maneuver. A single member of his coalition could potentially block legislation. A U.S. State Department spokesman said Wednesday that Lieberman's appointment raised \"legitimate questions\" about the direction of Israeli policy. What questions? The Obama administration's main policy concern is keeping alive the possibility of a two-state solution between Israelis and Palestinians. Israeli settlements and industry continue to expand in the West Bank, land Palestinians claim as part of a future state. Palestinians, along with many others, say this is making it increasingly difficult to negotiate a viable Palestinian state. In addition, Lieberman's appointment comes after a year in which hard-line nationalist policies have gained increased prominence in Israel. The current minister of culture, Miri Regev, has proposed stopping public funding to cultural groups deemed disloyal to Israel. Israeli human rights organizations that receive funding from governments abroad have come under new scrutiny. Some of these groups have been called traitors by Lieberman. Israel's deputy chief of staff, Yair Golan, warned in a speech earlier this month that he saw trends in Israel similar to those in pre-Nazi Germany. The now-fired defense minister, Moshe Ya'alon, responded to this controversial remark by urging military officers to continue to speak their minds. Recent government policies, and Lieberman's history of provocative remarks, have some Israelis warning that the country is becoming more isolated and losing support internationally. But Lieberman's supporters view him as a politician who says out loud what other people think but will not say. Is it possible that a right-wing government could make progress on peace negotiations with the Palestinians? Responding to criticism of Lieberman and his party, Netanyahu's office said that hard-line politicians have gotten further with Palestinians because Israelis feel confident security concerns will be front and center of any negotiations. And unlike other right-wing parties in the current government, Lieberman has proposed a peace deal that includes giving land to the Palestinians. His proposal would draw a border so that most West Bank Jewish settlements would be placed inside Israel, and towns currently in Israel with high Israeli Arab populations would wind up on the Palestinian side. However, Israeli Arabs have expressed strong opposition to this plan, with many saying this would effectively strip them of their Israeli citizenship.",

Lead seepage into the drinking water in Flint, Mich., has caused a massive public health crisis and prompted President Obama to declare a federal state of emergency there. The problem began when the city switched its water supply in 2014. Almost immediately, residents of Flint \u2014 a majority-black city where 40 percent of people live in poverty \u2014 started complaining about the quality of the water. City and state officials denied for months that there was a serious problem. By that time, supply pipes had sustained major corrosion and lead was leaching into the water. The city switched back to its original water supply late last year, but it was too late to reverse the damage to the pipes. High blood lead levels are especially harmful to children and pregnant women, and can cause \"learning disabilities, behavioral problems and mental retardation,\" the World Health Organization says. Here's how the crisis unfolded: Flint officials explore whether the city can save money by switching from its current provider, the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department (DWSD). City and state officials weigh an alternative: Flint could build its own pipeline to connect to the Karegnondi Water Authority (KWA). That option was projected to save the region $200 million over 25 years, according to City Council meeting minutes. On April 16, Flint Emergency Manager Ed Kurtz tells the state treasurer that the city is going to join the KWA. A day later, Detroit's water system tells Kurtz it is terminating service to the city effective a year later, in April 2014. Until Flint's pipeline connecting to the KWA is operational, the city needs an interim source of water and turns to the Flint River, which was also its main water source until the 1960s. Flint River water starts flowing to the city on April 25. In a press release, the city characterized it as a temporary switch and aimed to ease resident concerns about the water quality. Here's an excerpt: \"Even with a proven track record of providing perfectly good water for Flint, there still remains lingering uncertainty about the quality of the water. In an effort to dispel myths and promote the truth about the Flint River and its viability as a residential water resource, there have been numerous studies and tests conducted on its water by several independent organizations. ... Michael Prysby of the Michigan DEQ Office of Drinking Water verified that 'the quality of the water being put out meets all of our drinking water standards and Flint water is safe to drink.' ... \" 'It's regular, good, pure drinking water, and it's right in our backyard,' said Mayor [Dayne] Walling, \"this is the first step in the right direction for Flint, and we take this monumental step forward in controlling the future of our community's most precious resource.' \" Officials did not immediately treat the Flint River water to ensure it didn't cause corrosion in the pipes \u2014 instead, they took what Michigan Radio characterized as a \"wait-and-see\" approach. Some Flint residents complain about the smell and color of the new water, which is 70 percent harder than its previous water source, according to MLive. E. coli and total coliform bacteria are detected in Flint's water, prompting multiple advisories for residents to boil their water. An informational document from Michigan's Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) says the city addressed the problem by increasing chlorine levels in the water. General Motors says it will stop using Flint River water, fearing corrosion in its machines. \"Because of all the metal ... you don't want the higher chlorine water (to result in) corrosion,\" GM spokesman Tom Wickham tells MLive. \"We noticed it some time ago (and) the discussions have been going on for some time.\" A nail after one month of exposure to Detroit water (above) and Flint River water (below) Each nail was rinsed in flowing water before taking the picture.\n                \n                    \n                    Courtesy of FlintWaterStudy.org\n                    \n                \nhide caption A nail after one month of exposure to Detroit water (above) and Flint River water (below) Each nail was rinsed in flowing water before taking the picture. Flint is found to be in violation of the Safe Drinking Water Act because of the level of total trihalomethanes, or TTHM, in the water. TTHM are disinfection byproducts that occur when chlorine interacts with organic matter in the water. Some types are possible carcinogens for humans, the CDC says. In response, the state starts buying bottled water for its employees at government offices. This continues even after TTHM levels returned to compliance with the Safe Drinking Water Act in September 2015, MLive reported. A city test \"reveals high lead content in the water of a Flint resident's home.\" As Michigan Radio reported, the water at Lee Anne Walters' home \"turns up with a lead content of 104 parts per billion. Fifteen parts per billion is the [Environmental Protection Agency]'s limit for lead in drinking water.\" In April, Walters says her child was diagnosed with lead poisoning. An independent test done by Virginia Tech researchers finds lead levels at 13,200 ppb \u2014 water is considered hazardous waste at 5,000 ppb. The EPA says it was notified by the MDEQ on or about April 24 \"that the City did not have corrosion control treatment in place at the Flint Water Treatment Plant.\" A leaked internal memo from the EPA expresses concern about lead levels, including the level at Lee Anne Walters' home. The ACLU picks up the report. Michigan Radio reaches out to the MDEQ for comment about the memo, and spokesman Brad Wurfel says, \"Let me start here \u2014 anyone who is concerned about lead in the drinking water in Flint can relax.\" He adds that he hasn't seen the memo, but that preliminary tests show the Walters test was an \"outlier.\" Wurfel tells Michigan Radio, \"It does not look like there is any broad problem with the water supply freeing up lead as it goes to homes.\" The MDEQ dropped two samples from its initial report on lead levels from the city, which put the result within federally mandated levels. \"If the state had just dropped one high sample, Flint still would have been over the federal action level,\" Michigan Radio reports. \"But dropping two samples put them below the action level.\" Officials said the two samples did not meet federal criteria \u2014 because one of the samples had a water filter and another came from a business rather than a home, Michigan Radio reports. A team from Virginia Tech tests hundreds of homes for lead in Flint, and says that \"preliminary tests show 'serious' levels of lead in city water.\" \"The levels that we have seen in Flint are some of the worst that I have seen in more than 25 years working in the field,\" Dr. Marc Edwards, a member of the Virginia Tech team, tells Michigan Radio. Officials such as MDEQ spokesman Brad Wurfel dismiss the Virginia Tech results. He tells Michigan Radio: \"I don't know how they're getting the results they're getting. ... I know that it doesn't match with any of the other surveillance in the area.\" In an email to MLive journalist Ron Fonger, Wurfel says: \"It's scientifically probable a research team that specializes in looking for lead in water could have found it in Flint when the city was on its old water supply. We won't know that, because they've only just arrived in town and quickly proven the theory they set out to prove, and while the state appreciates academic participation in this discussion, offering broad, dire public health advice based on some quick testing could be seen as fanning political flames irresponsibly. Residents of Flint concerned about the health of their community don't need more of that.\" In a September interview with NPR, Edwards says: \"Flint is the only city in America that I'm aware of that does not have a corrosion control plan.\" A study from the local Hurley Medical Center found that 2.1 percent of children age 5 and under had elevated blood lead levels prior to the switch to Flint River water, compared to 4.0 percent after the switch. A spokeswoman for the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services said the elevated lead level results may be a result of seasonal changes, rather than the change in the water source. Registered Nurse Brian Jones draws a blood sample from Grayling Stefek, 5, at the Eisenhower Elementary School in Flint in January. The students were being tested for lead after elevated levels were found in the city's drinking water.\n                \n                    \n                    Carlos Osorio/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Flint issues a lead advisory to residents. \"While the City is in full compliance with the Federal Safe Drinking Water Act, this information is being shared as part of a public awareness campaign to ensure that everyone takes note that no level of lead is considered safe,\" it reads. That same day, Gov. Snyder's chief of staff, Dennis Muchmore, writes in an email that the MDEQ and Department of Community Health \"feel that some in Flint are taking the very sensitive issue of children's exposure to lead and trying to turn it into a political football claiming the departments are underestimating the impacts on the population and particularly trying to shift responsibility to the state.\" An action plan released by Snyder says the city and state will provide free filters and water testing for Flint residents, among other things. Flint switches back to the Detroit water supplier, which is now called the Great Lakes Water Authority. The governor's office said in press briefing notes that the Detroit water \"will be easier to manage. It comes from a more stable source than the river, it is fully optimized for corrosion control, and it is clear that residents of Flint have more confidence in this water source.\" In an email to a Detroit News reporter, MDEQ Director Dan Wyant discusses why there were no corrosion controls in place when the city started using Flint River water. He seems to chalk up the lack of corrosion controls to a misunderstanding: \"What has become clear in recent weeks is that the staff believed they were handling the situation in accordance with the proper protocol for a water provider using a new source, but the federal Lead and Copper rule has a particular provision for communities over 50,000 people; that the system operator must continue treating with full corrosion control even as they test the water. \"What the staff did would have been the proper protocol for a community under 50,000 people. None of the DEQ staff in this division had ever worked on a water source switch for a community over 50,000 people \u2014 it's uncommon for big communities to switch sources. \"It's increasingly clear there was confusion here, but it also is increasingly that DEQ staff believed they were using the proper federal protocol here and they were not.\" Wyant adds that lime had been added to the water but provided \"insufficient corrosion control.\" A December email from Snyder's communications director, Meegan Holland, also said that Flint never tested the impact of the Flint River water on the distribution system. Flint Mayor Karen Weaver declares a state of emergency over the elevated lead levels in the city's water. \"I am requesting that all things be done necessary to address this state of emergency declaration, effective immediately,\" Weaver tells the City Council, according to MLive. Weaver, who vowed to fix the water crisis, beat out incumbent Dayne Walling in an election the previous month. Flint Mayor Karen Weaver speaks at a press conference in March.\n                \n                    \n                    Geoff Robins/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption MDEQ Director Dan Wyant and spokesperson Brad Wurfel resign, MLive reports. This comes a day after the Flint Water Advisory Task Force, created by the governor, releases a preliminary report on the crisis and concludes that primary responsibility rests with the MDEQ. The report says that in the agency's interactions with the public about their concerns, its response \"was often one of aggressive dismissal, belittlement, and attempts to discredit these efforts and the individuals involved.\" Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder declares a state of emergency in Genesee County due to the lead in Flint's drinking water. President Obama declared a state of emergency less than two weeks later. The move \"means FEMA is authorized to provide equipment and resources to the people affected. Federal funding will help cover the cost of providing water, water filters and other items,\" as we reported. The EPA issues an emergency order to take action on the Flint water crisis. \"EPA has determined that the City of Flint's and the State of Michigan's responses to the drinking water crisis in Flint have been inadequate and that these failures continue,\" the emergency order reads. The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform hears testimony from several Flint officials and experts. But much attention has focused on who wasn't testifying at the hearing: Gov. Snyder and city emergency managers who presided over the change in Flint's water supply. Snyder, along with EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy, testifies before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. \"Let me be blunt,\" the governor says in his opening statement. \"This was a failure of government at all levels. Local, state and federal officials \u2014 we all failed the families of Flint.\" Flint resident Glaydes Williamson holds up a bottle of water from the city and hair pulled from her drain during a House Oversight and Government Reform Committee hearing in Washington, D.C., in February.\n                \n                    \n                    Molly Riley/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Snyder outlines state agencies' goals in addressing the Flint crisis. The action plan includes providing professional support for children under 6 with elevated lead levels, replacing water fixtures in public facilities, replacing the city's 8,000 lead service lines, and increasing resources for schools. Supporting its preliminary conclusion, the task force charged with investigating the causes of the Flint water crisis says in its final report that the MDEQ bears primary responsibility. Task force member Chris Kolb tells reporters: \"From a regulatory standpoint, to a protection of human health and the environment standpoint, they missed the boat completely. And it is extremely troublesome to me that an agency whose primary role, once again, is to protect human health and the environment came to these decisions, and they never backed off these decisions, no matter how many red flags they saw.\" Others are also to blame, the report says, including the state's Department of Health and Human Services, the city's emergency managers and the governor. Despite improved lead levels in Flint's water, it remains unsafe to drink without a filter, according to results released from Virginia Tech researchers. (Though Gov. Snyder later pledged to drink filtered Flint water for 30 days.) That's partially because residents have been using very little of the tainted water. As the Two-Way has reported, \"in an unfortunate cycle, the water additives that would 're-scale' corroded pipes in the water system, thereby preventing lead from leaching into the water, are not reaching the pipes because people in Flint don't want to pay for contaminated water that they can't use.\" MLive reports that in December, Flint began adding phosphates to the water that would \"rebuild the protective coating inside transmission lines.\" Michigan's attorney general, Bill Schuette, announces that three people will face charges \u2014 the first criminal charges leveled against officials over the lead crisis. Stephen Busch and Michael Prysby are state officials at the MDEQ. City employee Michael Glasgow is Flint's water quality supervisor. As the Two-Way reported, the three \"face felony charges including misconduct, neglect of duty and conspiracy to tamper with evidence. They've also been charged with violating Michigan's Safe Drinking Water Act.\" Schuette announced that his office is suing two companies involved in Flint's crisis, and he says the damages could reach hundreds of millions of dollars. Veolia, a French company, was hired by the city as a water-quality consultant in 2015. Texas-based firm Lockwood, Andrews & Newnam was originally hired in 2011 and helped to operate the water treatment plant using the Flint River. The civil lawsuit accuses both firms of negligence and public nuisance, and also accused Veolia of fraud. \"In Flint, Veolia and LAN were hired to do a job and failed miserably,\" Schuette told reporters at a news conference. \"They failed miserably in their job \u2014 basically botched it, didn't stop the water in Flint from being poisoned. They made it worse, that's what they did.\" Schuette announced criminal charges against six more current and former state employees, bringing the total number of people charged to nine. Liane Shekter-Smith is the former director of the drinking water and municipal assistance office within the MDEQ. She and two subordinates, Adam Rosenthal and Patrick Cook, allegedly misled officials about Flint's water treatment plant, which was not in compliance with lead and copper rules. The other three people charged are current or former employees of the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services. The director of the child health unit, Nancy Peeler, her subordinate, Robert Scott, and a state epidemiologist Corinne Miller allegedly failed to release a report that showed unsafe lead levels in the blood of Flint children. All six are charged with misconduct in office, conspiracy, and willful neglect of duty. Rosenthal is also charged with tampering with evidence, for allegedly requesting water tests that did not show elevated lead.",

It used to be that marriage was when adulthood began for American women. Moving straight out of their parents' house (or a college dorm) and into a house with a husband was simply the expected, preordained path for many women. But in the past few decades, wedding rings have become optional accessories. And as the American single woman flourished, she also profoundly changed (and is still changing) the economy, politics and the basic social fabric of the U.S. At least, that's what Rebecca Traister argues in her new book, All the Single Ladies. Traister, who considers herself a \"liberal feminist,\" spoke to NPR about the political shifts that single women are creating, as well as how feminism is factoring into the 2016 election. What are the biggest ways single women are shaping the country? It shifts all kinds of things about the country. It certainly shifts our definition of what family looks like. There's been what they call the \"great crossover,\" where the median age of first childbearing is now lower than the median age of first marriage. The notion of having a baby without being married has moved from being something that's so stigmatized \u2014 now, of course it is still stigmatized; I don't want to pretend that it's not \u2014 but this is a total revision when it comes to social expectations, the notion of what makes a family, how to design parenthood. So it shapes our idea of what families can look like, and I think it's done that in tandem with a gay rights movement that obviously has expanded definitions of families and parenthood and marriage to include same-sex couples. And then there's this whole world of social policy, which I argue is really tied to changing marriage patterns, and in ways that don't seem obvious perhaps. For example, I can't believe how central it is to what we talk about regularly, because it was third rail like five minutes ago, but for example, the push for paid family leave. In part, this comes from it being pushed by people who are close to power. In part, this comes from when changed marriage patterns sort of trickle up and become a mass behavior that is now happening within more economically privileged realms, and what you get are women and men who have these careers and they're marrying later, and their children are coming in the midst of these careers, and they're hitting the bump of, \"Wait a minute. We don't have paid leave.\" You're also seeing an enormous number of low-income women who are having kids on their own, and the fact that they don't have paid leave is far more economically devastating for them because they have to go back to work right away. So you have this kind of crisis that is born of a normalized female independence. And that is forcing a crisis, where it's actually forcing us to address it with social policy. I would say also things like rise in the minimum wage. I believe almost two-thirds of minimum wage earners are women, many of them single. So the drive to raise the minimum wage in part comes from a country in which women are now supporting themselves independently. And even when it comes down to how long are American school days? School gets out at 3. Tax breaks for people who are married. Those policies assume that there is a wage-earning person, presumed probably to be a man, and a domestic person in a given household. And the person who does the domestic labor is doing so for no wages or for low wages. That is no longer the case. The flip side of the discussion of the social safety net is the idea that marriage solves poverty. Unmarried Women and the Rise of an Independent Nation by Rebecca Traister Paperback, 339 pages | Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How? Well and that's the big push from conservatives. Look, there are lots of factors that combine. Women's entrance into the workforce all by itself is a big part of this. Of course, women's entrance into the workforce also enables women to live outside of marriage much more freely. But one of the ways you know that it's changing marriage patterns that might be at the heart of this is because that's what Republicans are freaking out about. So the enormous conservative push for not only everyone should get married but you should get married early, which is something Mitt Romney has emphasized. Jeb Bush ... wrote a [1995] book saying that the reason that we have a problem is that more single mothers aren't shamed to have their out of wedlock children. [On the campaign trail last year, Bush said he wanted to shame fathers who abandon their kids, but not mothers.] The amount of money that during the Bush administration \u2014 and then it's continued into the Obama administration \u2014 has poured into marriage education programs, with the idea that marriage would solve poverty. This is a completely backwards policy idea. [The Obama administration has continued to fund marriage education but has also shifted the focus more directly onto fatherhood, as the Christian Science Monitor has reported.] You know, some Republicans are trying to take playful aim at unmarried women. You saw that with the Republican gubernatorial ad campaign from 2014, I believe, where it was like \"Say Yes to the Dress,\" but it was \"Say yes to Rick Scott.\" Oh right. I remember that. And that was also the year that [Fox News' Jesse Watters] called single women \"Beyonce voters\" and said they just want to use the government as their husband. This is the right-wing talking point about privileged single women, which is they just want a hubby state where the government does what husbands used to do. By the way, that's not untrue! Because the government for a long time has supported men. This is a thing we never talk about. The government has supported male dominance in a whole lot of ways, by not effectively protecting equal pay [and] through housing loans and subsidizing men's college educations through the G.I. bill for a long time. There are all kinds of ways in which especially white men in this country have been helped by the government. But on the flip side you're seeing some ways men could use a boost these days \u2014 specifically, the argument that the Earned Income Tax Credit should help single, childless men more. That's exactly right, but that's another example of a readjustment of social policy in response to totally altered marriage and familial patterns. And there's this sense of like, wait a minute \u2014 our government benefits must better reflect what the citizenry actually looks like. And so to some extent, if the idea is that women, for example, would have kids and get to take their time to be with their kids because they would be dependent on an earning husband who is getting tax breaks for being married and having a kid \u2014 that is no longer the case. Women are no longer necessarily married to that husband \u2014 they are maybe themselves the earner. They are either single or they are a crucial half or more of their marital economy. Then you have to demand different kinds of support from the government than the kinds that just supported the male-breadwinner-female-domestic model. Clearly all women aren't the same \u2014 it feels wrong to lump all single women together when there are huge class divides. But what's interesting is that you talk about it trickling up, as opposed to down the chain. But that's true of so many things, and it's a pattern that's repeated over and over again \u2014 so for example, the act of women working for wages, which has been an economic necessity for women, and certainly most poor women forever. There may be many benefits to working outside the home for wages, but it's certainly not been done as an act of liberation. It's an act of economic necessity and has been since the beginning of time. However, when that behavior trickles up to middle class and often predominantly white women, it becomes discernible as liberation. When the women for whom it's not an economic necessity can see that there are various kinds of freedoms in it and power, then we can see it as part of the feminist revolution of the 1970s that white women moved into workplaces. So I would argue that there's a very similar pattern in terms of not marrying. Once you get wealthier women \u2014 who by the way with their singlehood, because they have more resources, are able to capitalize on many of the benefits of independence \u2014 on getting higher educations and bigger jobs and making more money, then it becomes a sort of glamorized thing. And I understand the temptation to say, \"Right, well, the way that those Sex and the City women are living has nothing to do with the way that poor women are living,\" but I think that's a disservice both to the poor women and the wealthier women. It casts poorer women just as victims, when in fact they were the pioneers of changing America's assumptions about how women's lives are supposed to go and about marriage patterns. And they were doing it because it's what they needed to do for their lives. And the other thing that it does is it says, \"These flashy women don't count either, because they're just living this stupid, flashy life that's just about high heels and drinks.\" That's not true either. You don't want to discount the power that is wielded by privileged independent women, who are first of all closer to having influence when it comes to things like government and social policy, and also who are challenging powerful men for all kinds of power as they become more independent and their independence becomes more threatening. So I have to back up and switch topics to Big Girls Don't Cry [Traister's 2010 book about women's prominent place in the 2008 election], because it seems so relevant today considering the \"mother-daughter divide\" everyone talks about among Democratic voters. What has changed since eight years ago? Oh we're repeating a lot of what's true about what happened in 2008. Last month, [after controversial statements about gender from Gloria] Steinem and [Madeleine] Albright and Bill Clinton, it felt like a reunion of the not-helping brigade from 2008. But I think the biggest positive change I can identify about [Hillary] Clinton's campaign this year is actually Clinton herself. I think she's running a much better campaign this year. I think her campaign is more functional. [But] it still has its challenges, especially sometimes with surrogates. The reception of her continues to be very mixed and very difficult to talk about, especially when you're in the midst of it. Because once again, everyone is still on a hair trigger. If you start to talk about the way gender plays into her self presentation or her reception or, for example, some of the things Bernie [Sanders] gets to do like promise revolution and shout, that probably a woman \u2014 and certainly not the first woman to come this close to the White House \u2014 would ever do. That lady would not be a plausible presidential candidate: the one who's telling you you're going to have a big socialist revolution. So if you start to talk about that, then tempers are so hot right now because people are lined up behind their candidates. And there are two really exciting candidates. Bernie and Hillary are both thrilling candidates. I think it's wonderful that we have this contest right now. But people are so angry that if you begin to talk about the gender very quickly there's a reflexive \"this is not about sexism. This is about her shortcomings.\" I've loved [Clinton's] lines that she's given in debates and town halls where she's said, \"I'm very excited to see people so passionate about Bernie Sanders and so engaged in politics, and I hope to work to earn their vote.\" But then you have something like Steinem's I think accidental remark on Bill Maher that seemed so disrespectful to young women. And certainly Albright, who I don't think would have gotten as much play had it not happened after Gloria Steinem, because Madeleine Albright says that [\"There's a special place in hell for women who don't help each other\"] like every day of her life. And as has been reported, it's on a Starbucks cup. I mean, it feels like a quote I've seen people Facebooking or social-media-ing or whatever for years. But in this context, it became a cudgel. Well, I never thought the quote was inspirational. It's always one of my least favorite. I don't think total gender solidarity is ever a requirement. And I hate the notion that sisterhood somehow is supposed to quell disagreement between women. Look. There is not a special place in hell for people who didn't support Sarah Palin. Do you know what I mean? It's ridiculous. And there is certainly not a special place in hell for women who don't support Hillary Clinton. However, the fact is [Albright] says it Monday-Tuesday-Wednesday-Thursday-Friday of every week, and it doesn't get much play. It was not invented by the Clinton campaign, nor was it invented for the Clinton campaign. When I asked a Bernie Sanders supporter in Iowa if she had at all been tempted by the possibility of voting for a woman, she told me, \"I'm not voting with my vagina.\" That phrase is kicked around these days, often in a bad way. So I'm wondering: Is it OK to vote for someone because she's a woman? Sure. Of course. It's OK to vote for anybody for any reason. This is the fog of war stuff. It's the middle of a very heated campaign. Everybody is very invested in their candidate. When I was going through this in 2008, I felt crazy. Like, Oh my God. You're not even allowed to say it's important to you that she's a woman, and we have literally our entire American history with no women in executive power? It's certainly not the foremost reason that anybody I knew supported her, but of course it played into lots of people's excitement about her, right? But you couldn't say it. It was considered a dumb thing to say. It was considered a super feminized thing to say. You were thinking with your ovaries. It's just because you were a girl, blah blah blah. And I remember thinking, Since when is it progressively OK that a country that's 51 percent female has only been governed by men? And that more than 80 percent of Congress is male? Why is it OK to not care about that? And then by the time I published my book in 2010, everyone was like, \"Oh, yes, that's very true. We did do that.\" There's a distance. And now we're back in it and again it's like \u2014 you might as well just like put giant ovaries in your eyes with hearts if you're going to say, \"It matters to me.\" Many of the people who are critical of Clinton but who are feminist and who are progressive, one of the things they say is, \"It's important to me to have a female president, but it's not the overriding concern for me, and it's not going to drive my vote.\" That's a really fair thing to say. It then gets transmitted very often \u2014 and especially if the person who has a really legitimate beef with Clinton, is very angry, or has also been made to feel like they are somehow betraying their sex if they're a woman or that they're not a real feminist \u2014 then it gets transmitted and amplified into \"I'm not going to do this stupid thing of voting with my vagina.\" So part of it I think it comes from well-intentioned progressives. And in part it's just a larger cultural message. If there weren't a lot of cultural and social resistance to having a woman president, we probably would have had one in the past 225 years. The resistance to this comes in many forms and from many directions. And I'm not saying that to oppose Clinton is a sexist move. I'm not equating opposition to Hillary Clinton with sexism. However, there are some people whose opposition to Clinton \u2014 on totally valid and legitimate grounds \u2014 some people reach for kind of dismissive or misogynist language to convey their distaste for her. Are you supporting any particular candidate at this point? No. I'm not shy about it: I do a lot of defense of Clinton. But my job is to put her candidacy in a gendered and historical context, which means I'm often left doing the work of doing feminist defense for her. I like [Clinton and Sanders] both. There are scenarios in which I could see myself voting for either one of them. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.",

Bernie Sanders reacts during Sunday's Democratic presidential primary debate at the University of Michigan, Flint.\n                \n                    \n                    Carlos Osorio/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton argues a point as Sen. Bernie Sanders reacts during Sunday's Democratic presidential primary debate at the University of Michigan, Flint. At Sunday night's Democratic debate in Flint, Mich., the candidates spent a considerable amount of time talking about that city's water crisis, as lead poisoning continues to affect Flint's majority black population. Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders also spent a lot of time talking about race and disparities endemic to the black community. At one point toward the end of the debate, CNN's Don Lemon asked both candidates to talk about any \"racial blind spots\" they might have. Both seemed to give thoughtful answers, but one particular line from Sanders drew rebuke. \"When you're white, you don't know what it's like to be living in a ghetto,\" Sanders said. \"You don't know what it's like to be poor; you don't know what it's like to be hassled when you walk down the street, or you get dragged out of a car.\" Some of Sanders' wording was pointed out as problematic. For one, lots of white people are poor, too. And not all black people are poor, either. (The Kaiser Family Foundation found the poverty rate for blacks in America to be 26 percent in 2014, the highest percentage of any racial group, but still, not a majority of blacks.) And the word \"ghetto\" itself is seen by some as problematic, racially coded and outdated. The stumble comes at a time when Sanders is trying hard to appeal to black voters in Michigan ahead of that state's primary Tuesday. His campaign is hoping that Sanders' message of economic equality and his opposition to free trade deals like NAFTA and the Trans-Pacific Partnership will help him win over black voters in the Great Lakes State. Sanders' comment speaks to a problem he has been encountering throughout the entire campaign, according to Andra Gillespie, who studies race and politics at Emory University \u2014 difficulty in disconnecting race from class. \"That's kind of the fundamental problem between some blacks and white progressives,\" she told NPR, \"this notion that white progressives think about class so much, that they forget there there's class diversity within African-American communities. And that there are ways that racism affects blacks regardless of their class status.\" Another part of Sanders' difficulty in talking about race might come from his background. As a senator from Vermont, he has not had to serve a large black constituency. Of course, Sanders was very active in the civil rights movement in the 1960s, even being arrested for his activism; but that was decades ago. Clinton, on the other hand, has spent time in Arkansas and South Carolina over the course of her career, states with sizable black populations. And she is married to Bill Clinton, a man many claim has a special relationship with black voters. Clinton stumbled over race Sunday night, too. She was challenged on her support of two of her husband's signature policies: the so-called crime bill of 1994, and his welfare reform bill of 1996. Critics say both of those laws disproportionately hurt black families and sent large numbers of black people to prison for nonviolent offenses. Clinton was also questioned over her use of the word \"superpredators\" in supporting that crime bill. In a 1996 speech, she argued that America must take back its streets from \"crime, gangs and drugs\" and organize against \"the kinds of kids that are called superpredators,\" who according to her have \"no conscience, no empathy.\" Clinton said law enforcement had to \"bring them to heel.\" During the debate, Clinton said that that was a poor choice of words and that she wouldn't use that phrasing in the future. She also said she had some problems with the '94 crime bill. For months now, Clinton has faced questions over those two bills, and her husband's record. And it seems to have caught her campaign off guard; in previous presidential elections, things like the crime bill and welfare reform were either seen as positives or almost entirely forgotten by Democrats. And Clinton's relationship was thought to be airtight. Sanders, for his part, has sought to clarify his use of the word ghetto since the debate. On Monday, he said, \"What I meant to say is when you talk about ghetto, traditionally, what you're talking about is African-American communities. There's nobody on this campaign ... who has talked about poverty \u2014 whether it is the white community, the black community, the Latino community \u2014 more than I have. We have 47 million people living in poverty in America. And in the wealthiest country in the history of the world, that is a disgrace. I've talked about that more than anybody else.\" However voters respond to Sanders' comments on race, and Clinton's comments on Bill Clinton-era policies, one thing stood out: This election cycle, Democrats are talking about race and issues important to black people a lot. Flint, race and inequality dominated Sunday's debate; at the latest GOP presidential debate, Flint occupied only one question. Some of the discussion on race is a direct result of Super Tuesday and the way that calendar prioritizes Southern states like South Carolina that have large numbers of black voters. That's ironic, because when it was initially created, Super Tuesday was meant to give more voting power to Southern conservatives. Something else stood out Sunday night as well: the way Sanders and Clinton both felt fully empowered to engage on race and issues affecting black America almost the entire night. One could imagine a 2008 presidential candidate Barack Obama, struggling to appeal to white moderate voters and not appear \"too black,\" being reluctant to do the same.",

            "article_content": "Donald Trump has been changing his tone toward African-Americans and Latinos in recent days. He's been speaking in mostly white communities, but on Wednesday he'll speak in mostly black Jackson, Miss.  DAVID GREENE, HOST: We're going to sort through some new developments in the presidential campaign. In a moment, we'll look at how the Clinton Foundation is planning to scale back if Hillary Clinton wins the election. The head of the foundation laid out those plans to NPR late yesterday. RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: There have also been questions about whether Donald Trump is scaling back his plans on immigration. NPR's Sarah McCammon is following that. She's on the line with us from Jackson, Miss., where Donald Trump will campaign later today. Good morning. SARAH MCCAMMON, BYLINE: Good morning, Renee. MONTAGNE: So last weekend, Donald Trump met with a roundtable of Hispanic leaders. Since then, we've heard a number of different things about where Trump is heading on immigration. What do you know, say, as of this morning? MCCAMMON: Well, it's kind of been the mystery of the week with the Trump campaign. There had been indications that Trump was ready to soften his call for a deportation force to remove people in the country illegally. His running mate, Mike Pence, said yesterday that would be sorted out in the next couple of days. And then Trump was asked about this in a Fox News town hall with Sean Hannity last night. Here's what he had to say. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"HANNITY\") DONALD TRUMP: There certainly can be a softening because we're not looking to hurt people. We want people. We have some great people in this country. We have some great, great people in this country. (APPLAUSE) TRUMP: So - but we're going to follow the laws of this country. MCCAMMON: And that sounds similar to the position of many Republicans and, frankly, of President Obama, who has stepped up deportations, compared to the Bush administration. Trump's campaign manager seemed to praise President Obama for that in an interview yesterday, while arguing Hillary Clinton will be weak on immigration. MONTAGNE: But isn't there some risk that Donald Trump could alienate his base if he does, as he says, soften his position on immigration? MCCAMMON: Right. Remember, this is the issue that has fired up so many Trump supporters from the very beginning... MONTAGNE: Oh, yeah. MCCAMMON: ...Fueled his campaign. At a rally last night in Texas, it sounded like some of the same old Donald Trump. He appeared with parents whose children were killed by people in the country illegally. The crowd broke into chants of build the wall. You know, so the base is pretty locked in on this issue. But Trump has to expand beyond that if he wants to win the general election. Polls are making it clear. Over the last month or so, he's been slipping several points behind Hillary Clinton. So there seems to be a tension here between whether Trump can pivot to expand his appeal to more moderate Republican voters, to minorities - and at the same time, just let Trump be Trump. MONTAGNE: Right. But Trump has also been making what seems to be an appeal to African-American voters in recent days. He's speaking tonight in Jackson, Miss., as we said, which is predominantly an African-American city. You're there. What do you expect to hear? MCCAMMON: So for months, Trump has said that he will do well with black voters, although he is registering in the low single digits in polls right now. And so in several recent speeches, he's been giving a pretty bleak portrayal of what life is like in black communities. Here's what he said this week in Akron, Ohio. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: Poverty, rejection, horrible education, no housing, no homes, no ownership, crime at levels that nobody's seen - you can go to war zones in countries that we're fighting. And it's safer that living in some of our inner cities. They're run by the Democrats. MCCAMMON: And Renee, I've spent the past day here in Jackson, Miss. African-Americans here have told me that's not their experience of their community. And, you know, you hear Trump's pitch arguing that Democrats have failed African-Americans. But it's not clear it's resonating so far. MONTAGNE: Yeah. Well, the people you've talked to - what are they saying? MCCAMMON: You know, I'm not meeting a lot of fans of Donald Trump. I've heard what he says is demeaning - that he's talking down to African-Americans by making these broad-brush statements about how terrible things are. A lot of people here have their views of Donald Trump pretty well-set. So all of this may not help Trump much with African-American voters, Renee, but it could help him with a key slice of white voters - those being suburban women. They tend to be swing voters - often, really key for Republicans. And if they hear Trump talking about African-American issues and feel like some of the racial overtones may be softening on his campaign, that could help Trump. MONTAGNE: NPR's Sarah McCammon speaking to us from Jackson, Miss., where Donald Trump will campaign tonight - thanks, Sarah. MCCAMMON: Thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "Donald Trump is continuing his efforts to reach out to Africa-Americans. He spoke on Wednesday at a predominantly black church in Cleveland Heights, Ohio.  DAVID GREENE, HOST: Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has been making stark appeals for the African-American vote. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DONALD TRUMP: You do right every day by your community and your families. You raise children in the light of God. I will always support your church - always. GREENE: That was Trump a few weeks ago in a Detroit church. Here is a Trump line from another event. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: Why do you have to lose? You're living in poverty. Your schools are no good. You have no jobs. GREENE: OK. NPR's Scott Detrow has been covering Trump's outreach to the black community, joins me in the studio. And, Scott, what's the strategy here? SCOTT DETROW, BYLINE: Well - the last month or so, nearly every speech Trump has addressed black voters. Basically saying, hey, things aren't going well for you right now. You typically vote Democrat. What do you have to lose by voting for me? GREENE: Look for another option, he says. DETROW: Right. And this has widely been interpreted as less about winning the support of black voters, who are typically solid Democratic voters. And the argument is more about appealing to Republicans who are still hesitant about Trump. You know, a lot of polls show high percentages of people every time have a perception that Trump appeals to bigotry. Things he said about Mexican immigrants, Muslims, other minority groups sticking in their mind. The theory here is he's making this push to show that that isn't the case, that he does care about minority groups throughout the country. GREENE: Doesn't sound like he always sticks to a very clear message, though? DETROW: No. And I think actually yesterday is a great example of that. Early in the day, he was speaking about the fatal police shooting of Terrence Crutcher in Tulsa, Okla. And he criticized the police officers involved. He said he - it looks like Crutcher did everything right. He suggested that the police officer basically choked, that she didn't do the right thing there. And that was notable because typically Trump is very supportive of police officers. In fact, the Fraternal Order of Police has criticized him for saying this. But then last night, he was on \"Sean Hannity.\" Actually, this was taped yesterday, but it hasn't fully aired yet. But we have a clip of it. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"THE SEAN HANNITY SHOW\") TRUMP: I would do stop-and-frisk. I think you have to. We did it in New York. It worked incredibly well. And you have to be proactive. GREENE: Oh, this is stop-and-frisk, the policy of, I mean, stopping people on the streets. And a lot of people in New York felt that it was basically profiling, I mean, going after minorities. DETROW: Highly controversial, it was a key issue in New York's last mayoral election. And data shows vast, vast majority of people stopped were young minority males. And in fact, a federal judge said this was an unconstitutional practice. So backing stop-and-frisk like Trump just did seems to go directly against the appeals he has been making. GREENE: So any idea whether this kind of outreach is working in some way for the Trump campaign? DETROW: It depends how you measure it. When it comes to his poll numbers among black voters, no. Trump has been polling in single digits most of the year. In a lot of polls this year, he's placed fourth among black voters after Gary Johnson and Jill Stein. A big poll that came out yesterday from NBC and the Wall Street Journal had Trump at 7 percent among African-American voters, compared to 83 percent for Clinton. But enthusiasm among black voters is a lot lower than it's been in 2012 and 2008. So if black voters simply stay home, if they don't show up at the numbers that they typically do, that could really hurt Hillary Clinton and other Democrats. GREENE: And that could be very important in some of the states that we have been talking about. I mean, I remember in Ohio, the city of Cleveland was very important for George W. Bush. In talking about whether or not the black vote would turn out, we're talking about states like North Carolina. I mean, that could be a very big deal. DETROW: Absolutely. There are a lot of states here that are critical on the map, including - especially this increasingly tightening map that we're looking at, where whether or not black voters show up in large numbers like they have in the last few cycles could be make or break for Democrats. GREENE: OK. NPR's Scott Detrow, thanks a lot. DETROW: Anytime. Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump will be in West Virginia on Thursday ahead of its primary on May 10. Appalachia is an important region for Sanders, who has done well among the white working class.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Let's hear the way one Democrat is thinking about a conservative state. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: Sen. Bernie Sanders visits West Virginia today. His stops include a town hall meeting in McDowell County. INSKEEP: It's in a remote part of the state, a county where the mountains are high, the historic coal industry is dying and incomes are among the lowest in America. MARTIN: Sanders is there because a Democratic primary is approaching. Hillary Clinton visited this week, too. INSKEEP: But it also brings to mind a general election. West Virginia is a state that has not voted Democratic for president in this century, even though it is filled with people Sanders would like to help. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST) BERNIE SANDERS: You know, when we talk about poverty, Steve, we often think - well, it is too bad somebody can't afford a flat-screen TV or go out to eat. But what poverty is really about is that we have millions of people who are dying at ages much, much younger than they should in McDowell County. The average life expectancy for men in that county is 64 years of age. Sixty-four years of age. And yet, you go a six-hour drive to Fairfax County, Va., six-hour drive, a man can expect to live until the age of 82 years of age - 18 years longer than men in McDowell County. INSKEEP: These are really compelling statistics. But there's another statistic that's on my mind, along with the poverty stats and the life-expectancy - shocking life-expectancy stats. You're going to a couple of counties - McDowell County in West Virginia is one of them - that voted for Barack Obama in 2008 and then voted against him for Mitt Romney in 2012. What has been happening to the Democratic Party in the region where you're going? SANDERS: Well, that's an excellent question. And I think it goes well beyond McDowell County and well beyond West Virginia. And I think that there are many people around the country - poor people, working people - who believe that the Democratic Party is not effectively standing up to them. Now, if I lived in McDowell County and the unemployment rate was sky-high and I saw my kid get addicted to opiates and go to jail, there were no jobs - you know what? - I would be looking at Washington and saying - what are you guys doing for me? And I'm going to look at an alternative. I think one of the challenges that we face right now - and what my campaign is about - is making it clear that the Democratic Party must be on the side of working people and low-income people. Now, I'm talking a poverty. You got to make a stand. And the stand we've got to make is to stand with the people of McDowell County, W.Va, and poor people and working people all over this country. INSKEEP: It's interesting when you travel in that region, as we did just a few weeks ago for MORNING EDITION here. You're in coal country. You hear people bring up Hillary Clinton in a specific way. She was criticized for saying that we're going to make coal jobs go away, even though she was going on to say - and we want to help people who lose their jobs. But she was criticized for that one part of the statement. Would you be any better from the perspective of people in Appalachia who are concerned about that... SANDERS: Look, I have spent my whole life fighting for working people. I have a 98 percent voting record with the AFL-CIO. I have opposed disastrous trade agreements, and I think there is perhaps no candidate in the United States Senate who has a more progressive record than I do. But I also believe and understand, as a member of the Senate Environmental Committee, that climate change is real. It is caused by human activity, and it is already causing severe problems in our country and around the world. And we have a transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy. Now, I introduced the most comprehensive climate change legislation ever introduced in the U.S. Senate. And in that legislation - because we understand it is not the fault of the coal miners or people involved in the fossil fuel industry - they have a right to want to feed their families and live in dignity. We have $41 billion in that legislation to make sure that those workers who might be displaced as a result of the transition away from fossil fuels get the extended unemployment benefits they need, get the education they need, get the job training that they need. And also, we are going to invest heavily into those communities. INSKEEP: How do you speak to people in a community like that who have deeply mixed feelings about government? You may run into the same person who says I'm on Medicaid. I get various kinds of assistance, but I really don't like it. I don't like living like this. I don't like depending on government. SANDERS: Well, I think it raises a fundamental issue about politics in America today and who we are as a civilized society. I understand that the right wing has done a very good job in suggesting that freedom - and this is the Koch brothers' line - you know, freedom is about ending Social Security and Medicare and Medicaid and actually abolishing the concept of the minimum wage. So Steve, you could be a free guy and work for $4 an hour. Aren't you a lucky guy? But you know what? Most Americans don't believe that. And one of the things I'm really proud of in this campaign is that in election after election, in primary and caucus after caucus - right here in Indiana where we won, two-thirds of the people 45 years of age or younger voted for me. And the reason, I think, is they understand that in a democratic, civilized society, government have a very important role to play. And the word has got to out. It doesn't get out all that often in the media. INSKEEP: Well, what do you say, then, to people who just say - regardless of my own situation, it bothers me that government has to do so much for people - or is doing so much for people. SANDERS: I think that that is mythology that has been effectively perpetrated by the big-money interests in this country. To say that, every other country in the world guarantees health care to all of their people. Every other country has paid medical and family leave. A number of countries provide free tuition in public colleges and universities. Most countries take care of their elderly and their children a lot better than we do. I think what you have seen in the last many years is a very coordinated effort on the part of corporate media and the wealthiest people in this country to perpetuate an ideology which says the government is terrible. Government is awful - oh, by the way, except when we can get some corporate welfare. I point out in all of my speeches, Steve, that Wal-Mart, which is owned by the Walton family, the wealthiest family in this country, worth some $149 billion dollars - they get a huge subsidy from the taxpayers of this country - from you, from me, from every working person because the wages that they pay their employees are so low that many of those workers have to go on Medicaid or food stamps in order to survive. I don't think the middle class of this country should be subsidizing the wealthiest family in the United States of America.

Hillary Clinton's recent surge in the polls is being fueled in part by a demographic that President Obama lost handily four years ago \u2014 white, college-educated voters. \"In over a half-century, no Democratic presidential candidate has carried white voters with a college degree,\" said Michelle Diggles, a senior political analyst with the center-left think tank Third Way, who described the split between the white working class and whites with a college degree as \"the most underreported story of this year.\" GOP nominee Donald Trump is hoping that white working-class voters can fuel his own victory. But his climb becomes doubly harder as he is far behind Clinton in the demographic bloc that is usually reliably Republican. In the last presidential election, Barack Obama lost the college-educated white voters by 14 points. But now Clinton is winning this same group by about 8.7 points, according to an average of the most recent NBC/Wall Street Journal, CNN/ORC and ABC/Washington Post polls. \"In the past, many college graduates, white people that were business managers or had various kinds of middle-class jobs, would vote Republican \u2014 and that group may be taking a second look at the Democratic Party,\" said Bill Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Institution. NPR only had access to exit polls dating to 1988, but with the help of the Pew Research Center, we were able to identify the education/class divide and explore the Republican dominance over time. Why are we seeing a shift now? \"It seems that Donald Trump is a uniquely polarizing figure amongst white voters,\" Diggles observed. \"There are a lot of voters who are concerned that Donald Trump is ... just so outside of the mainstream and so outside the American political culture that they can't fathom it.\" She pointed to Trump's close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin, his \"anti-democratic\" rhetoric, and his threats to the freedom of the press. The outspoken billionaire's immigration policy \u2014 which includes mass deportations and plans to build a wall between Mexico and the U.S. border \u2014 also does not seem to resonate well with some well-educated voters. Trump's tone and antics, particularly in the week following the Democratic National Convention \u2014 which included a fight with a Muslim American military family, a reluctant endorsement of House Speaker Paul Ryan and a strange response to sexual harassment \u2014 did not help his case either. GOP strategist Lisa Camooso Miller said she is not surprised college-educated voters seem to be tilting toward Clinton, given the \"tone\" of the two conventions \u2014 the DNC as one of hope but the Republican National Convention as one of fear. \"I think people that are college educated have a general understanding that America is the melting pot ... and that's what makes this country great,\" she said. \"I think that the more [Trump] identifies and specifically singles out various segments of the population, I think that turns people off.\" Camooso Miller also observed that college-educated voters probably prefer Clinton's stability and predictability, regardless of whether they agree with her specific policy proposals. Frey agreed, arguing that the overall message of the GOP convention depicted an impending era of \"doom and gloom,\" targeting Americans who are suffering in the current economy; but he said college-educated voters are more likely to see their jobs as part of a global economy. Frey also believes that for some college-educated voters (who might traditionally vote Republican for economic reasons), the overall vision and identity of the country has become more pivotal to their vote than the economy. \"[Trump's candidacy] has become not so much an intraparty battle as it has become a battle about what is America,\" said Diggles, explaining why we have seen a spate of recent defections of high-profile, highly educated Republicans. What does this mean for November? If the polls are accurate, having a college education seems to be a key indicator of how white voters will cast their ballot on Election Day. Using census data, NPR ranked all 50 states according to the share of the white (non-Hispanic) population, age 25+, with a bachelor's degree or higher. This helps understand which states may be at play this November and why. For example, there are a few states on polar opposite ends of the education spectrum: In recent election cycles, blue-collar white voters have voted consistently Republican; Trump is hoping to do better than Mitt Romney or John McCain did with this group in 2012 and 2008, respectively. And in the Buckeye State, it's a gamble that might pay off. \"I certainly think Ohio is a state where there's a good possibility that the noncollege whites could bring a victory to Donald Trump ... if they up their turnout,\" said Frey. He pointed out that many working-class voters feel like they've been left behind in a modern economy, and so they're \"buying\" any message Trump sells them. In Pennsylvania, another critical battleground state, the white demographics aren't much better for Clinton (29.41 percent), but there's a larger African-American and Latino population to offset the white population. An era of \"Clinton Republicans\"? It's hard to say whether this realignment of college-educated white voters is a short-term Trump side effect or the beginning of a new political label \u2014 so-called Clinton Republicans. Trump is certainly a \"change\" candidate, as evidenced by the coalition he built during the GOP primary. But that change hasn't necessarily appealed to highly educated voters. Last week, the oldest college Republican group in the country, the Harvard Republican Club, said it was \"ashamed\" of Trump. It announced it will not be endorsing the GOP presidential nominee \u2014 a first in the group's 128-year history. But Frey questions whether that shift away from Trump will last long-term. \"I think this time, whoever votes against Donald Trump is not someone who's necessarily gonna stay with the Democratic Party for year after year after year in the future,\" said Frey. \"It's probably more a vote against the brand of candidate that Donald Trump represents than maybe a vote against the Republican Party.\" For reasons like that, Camooso Miller remains optimistic about her party's future. \"I think that 2016 is an example year, and is not necessarily the norm,\" she said. \"I do not think this is a trend that will grow.\" The GOP strategist pointed to other Republican leaders, such as House Speaker Paul Ryan, who who could help re-energize and re-engage this college-educated white voting demographic in the future. Democrats' millennial advantage Still, the very people who make up the college-educated white demographic are not necessarily the same people who voted eight years ago. The composition has fundamentally changed. Millennials, the youngest generation of voters, have grown up and now rival baby boomers as a political force \u2014 with an estimated 69.2 million eligible voters, according to data from the Pew Research Center. Millennials lean left and are the most educated demographic to date, and they are an increasingly large share of the overall white college-educated bloc. Plus, Diggles insisted that in all of the focus groups she has conducted, she consistently sees a difference between older and younger white men, regardless of their level of education. Polling shows that white millennials are skeptical of a Trump presidency. So as those voters get older, unless they change their political attitudes drastically, the Democratic Party may have an inherent advantage in future elections. The education/race cleavages explain why the Trump campaign is spending so much time and effort in Ohio and Pennsylvania \u2014 Rust Belt states where the white population is less educated than the country as a whole. Because while Clinton may have a single-digit edge with educated voters, Trump has a double-digit advantage with white working-class voters. And in these states, the GOP nominee has more room to grow because there's a larger pool of voters he can potentially energize. As NPR has reported previously, noncollege white voters, especially men, are one of the most consistently Republican voting blocs \u2014 so-called Reagan Democrats. \"They think that Donald Trump isn't afraid to speak his mind, and he speaks in a language that represents them and their anger,\" said Diggles, who points out that in focus groups she often hears from white men nostalgic about the past and frustrated that their economic fortunes aren't as good as their fathers' or grandfathers'. Obama lost white blue-collar voters by 25 points, according to 2012 exit polls. But that still wasn't enough to derail his re-election. To win this year, Trump will need to win white working-class voters by even bigger margins. Polling shows he is currently doing about as well as Romney did, but the hiccup for him is that white working-class voters are a shrinking share of the electorate.",

Jerry Brown speaks at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia on Wednesday. California Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat, has been in politics since the 1960s, and launched multiple runs for president himself. In 1992, he ran as the outsider candidate \u2014 chastising the incumbent parties that had \"failed their duty.\" \"They've placed their own interest about the national interest,\" he said during the speech that kicked off his campaign. They've allowed themselves to be trapped and in some cases corrupted by the powerful forces of greed. It's time for them go!\" Today, Brown says that anti-establishment energy is central to the current presidential campaign \u2014 not just for Bernie Sanders, he argues, but Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump as well. \"Everybody who's running for office in some way has to capture the mood of discontent and skepticism about the incumbent party,\" he tells NPR's Audie Cornish. \"Certainly Mr. Trump is gonna try to capture as much of that as he can. But if you look at the two of them, Trump is the fellow who stiffed his subcontractors, went through bankruptcy and has focused his whole life on making money, or having a television show, or running a beauty pageant,\" Brown says. \"When you contrast that with Hillary's vast experience, the choice couldn't be clearer.\" Although Clinton supporters have repeatedly made that argument, she still needs to present herself in a way that convinces more skeptical voters, Brown acknowledges. Looking ahead, Brown says Democrats must engage in \"creative intervention\" \u2014 in areas such as the minimum wage, family leave, childcare and education \u2014 to ensure the party doesn't lose working-class voters forever. Use the audio link above to hear the full conversation.  AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: Now, earlier today I spoke with California Governor Jerry Brown about what Hillary Clinton hopes to achieve with tonight's speech. He has been in politics since the 1960s and even launched multiple runs for president himself. And then in 1992, he ran as the outsider candidate. And I played him a clip of the speech that kicked off that campaign. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JERRY BROWN: The leaders of Washington's incumbent party, both Democrats and Republicans, have failed their duty. They've placed their own interests above the national interests. They have allowed themselves to be trapped and in some cases corrupted by the powerful forces of greed. It's time for them to go. (CHEERING, APPLAUSE) CORNISH: It seems like you were really channeling that anti-establishment energy that we heard again this year. And what are the parallels you see today? BROWN: Well, that was said right here in Philadelphia just a few blocks from where we're sitting. And the perspective is that Washington is captured by all these alien forces and that we the people have to take it back. That was part of the message of Bernie Sanders, but it's also increasingly part of the message of Hillary Clinton. And it's a perennial. CORNISH: It's also a message from Donald Trump - right? - in many ways. BROWN: Well, because it is the message, so everybody who's running for office in some way has to capture the mood of discontent and skepticism about the incumbent party, which, by the way, is Republican in the Congress, Democrat in the White House. Certainly Mr. Trump is going to try to capture as much of that as he can. But if you look at the two of them, Trump is the fellow who stiffed his subcontractors, went through bankruptcy and has focused his whole life on making money or having a television show or running a beauty pageant. So when you contrast that with Hillary's vast experience, the choice couldn't be clearer. CORNISH: You know, you're pointing out an argument that we're hearing from Democrats over and over about Hillary Clinton's resume compared to Donald Trump's, that there's not a comparison there. But the race is close. This is not some sort of cakewalk for her right now. BROWN: No, not at all. It's a very competitive race, and... CORNISH: But does that mean that argument is not working? BROWN: Well, it - look; I think this campaign is a real boost, and she definitely has to present herself in a way that touches those more skeptical voters. CORNISH: People have been talking a lot this election cycle about the white, working-class vote and the support there for Republicans. Have Democrats lost this group forever? BROWN: Well, it's always this - it's a concern. The non-college-graduate, a real foundation of the American society, has not done well in the global environment of more and more trade, the technology that's transforming our economy. Everybody knows that the globalization increases overall wealth, but it does increase overall inequality. Then the question is, how do you deal with that? Well just more unconstrained capitalism is not going to help the white working class or the black working class or anybody that isn't in the hallways of power and affluence - so I say a creative intervention in the minimum wage, on family leave, on childcare, on good schools, on all that part of the public sector that enriches life. CORNISH: People talk about Democrats having to get voter turnout from what they call the Obama coalition, a multi-racial coalition of voters. You come from a state where the demographics are favorable to Democrats in some ways. And are Democrats kind of relying on that? BROWN: You know, you can't really rely on micro-targeting to chop and dice the American people into little categories that you then appeal to very specific, tailored messages. There has to be an overarching vision for America that we're all a part of. We're not all just demographics, and there's a lot of that. You know, these terms like boomer, gen X, millennial - these are advertising terms. And as a political person, you have to think in much larger terms than advertising. You have to think in the human experience of America, our history, our future together. And I think Hillary is in a very strong position to do that. CORNISH: Governor Jerry Brown, thank you so much for speaking with us. BROWN: OK, thank you very much. Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "Barack Obama won Iowa twice \u2014 in part because he did well with white working-class voters. Now, as education and race have erupted as fault lines, can a Democrat still win that demographic in Iowa?  RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: Every presidential election seems to bring a group of voters who get a lot of attention because they are viewed as being decisive. This election, it's the white working class. Donald Trump is getting a lot of his support from these voters. And in at least one important battleground state, white, working-class voters were key to Barack Obama's victory. NPR's Asma Khalid covers the intersection of demographics and politics and joins us now to explain. Good morning. ASMA KHALID, BYLINE: Good morning, Renee. MONTAGNE: And we are talking here about the state of Iowa. We know Barack Obama won Iowa in 2008 fairly convincingly. How important are these voters to winning that state? KHALID: Renee, they're very important. There are a lot of white, working-class voters in Iowa. That's true today. And it was true eight years ago, as well. I talked to Dave Swenson about this. He's researched Iowa economics and demographics for the past 30 years. DAVID SWENSON: The largest employer in Iowa, in terms of an industrial group, is manufacturing by a long shot. So we have a significant blue-collar presence. KHALID: But, Renee, the thing is these blue-collar workers in Iowa seem to have voted far more Democratic than other states in the past. If you look at exit polls from 2008, you'll see that Barack Obama lost white voters without a college degree by 18 percentage points nationally. But he actually won that group in Iowa by about 6 percent. And what's even stranger is that he did better with these non-college-educated, white voters than he did with white, college-educated voters in Iowa that year. MONTAGNE: You're saying, then, that white, working-class voters in Iowa were an anomaly. KHALID: Well, Renee, what I can say is that white, working-class voters in Iowa voted Democratic. And that was atypical. This year, blue-collar Iowans seem to be voting more like the country. And that is bad news for Democrats. The website FiveThirtyEight has written about the 2014 Iowa Senate race and found that Democrats lost the non-college, white vote that year by double digits. That seemed to be a sign that white voters without a college degree were moving away from the Democratic Party in Iowa. And, you know, this year, we've seen race and education as the major fault lines in this election. And so I think some of these divides that were already taking shape a couple of years ago are beginning to come to the forefront. I asked Dave Swensen about this, specifically, in Iowa. SWENSON: Every single recession bounces us down just a little bit lower. We've only recovered about half of the jobs we lost before the recession. And so you very well may have well-distributed economic anxiety among a relatively large fraction of the state's workforce. KHALID: And, clearly, Donald Trump has tapped into that. MONTAGNE: And Asma, that seems to really bring into focus how the larger dynamics in this race could be changing the electoral map generally. KHALID: That's true, Renee. Donald Trump speaks rather intensely about other industrial states like Ohio, Michigan and Pennsylvania. And he's been making a major play for a number of those industrial Rust-Belt states. The thing is if you look at a state like Michigan or Pennsylvania, while they do have large white, working-class populations, the reason they are seeming to more stubbornly trend Democratic still is because they also have a large African-American population to offset the potential, you know, gains that Donald Trump may be making with blue-collar, white voters. On the other hand, Ohio is a little bit different. It seems that it could potentially go for Donald Trump more easily than some of these other Rust-Belt states I mentioned. And, Renee, if we move out of the Rust Belt and back into Iowa, you'll see that there are a number of other factors aligning in Trump's favor beyond just education levels. The population in this state is about 90 percent white. And it also has a relatively large rural population. So to sum up, Iowa and Ohio are two states that demographically seem to favor Donald Trump. MONTAGNE: NPR's Asma Khalid covers the intersection of demographics and politics. Thanks very much.

            "article_content": "U.S. electoral demographics have drastically changed in the past few decades. Brookings Institution demographer William Frey provides analysis, along with NPR's Asma Khalid and Domenico Montanaro.  MICHEL MARTIN, HOST: Let's go to demographics now. There's been a lot of study of the demographics this year that could decide this election and a lot of money being spent targeting voters who could tip the vote. So we're joined now in studio by NPR's Asma Khalid who spent this election season studying the intersection of demographics and politics. Also with us is NPR's political editor Domenico Montanaro. And we're joined by Bill Frey. He's a demographer at the Brookings Institution. That's a research institute here in Washington, D.C. Thank you all so much for joining us for this. DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Thank you. WILLIAM FREY: Yes. MARTIN: So, Domenico, let's start with you because as journalists we spend a lot of time talking about these issues. But for people who aren't, is there a data point that you think people need to know to understand where the country is and where it's going? MONTANARO: I mean, the first thing to think about is the fact that the white vote has been on a steady decline over the past generation. You know, consider in 1976, the white vote was 89 percent. Eighty-nine percent of all voters were white. This time around, it could be at or below 70 percent or thereabouts for the first time in American history, and that has had profound effects on our politics. Think about the fact that a majority of kindergartners are now non-white. By 2020, by the next presidential election, non-whites will be a majority of all children. And by 2044, no racial group will be a majority in this country. MARTIN: Asma, do you want to add something to this? ASMA KHALID, BYLINE: Yeah. The one other thing that I think is really interesting about the way the electorate looks now is that it's just much more highly educated than it has been. We've been hearing so much this election cycle about white working-class voters. Right? And if you look at 1980, you'll see that white working class made up about two-thirds of the electorate. If you look then at the 2012 election, I believe they were only about a third of all the voters who cast their ballots in 2012, so it is a shrinking population. There is just a much larger percentage of people getting a college degree, and that's particularly the case when you look at younger voters, millennials. MARTIN: I want to dig into a couple of different demographic groups in just a minute. But, Bill Frey, I'd love to hear from you on this as well. I'm particularly interested in this whole question of identity politics. I mean, we've heard this term used in the past. Generally people have been talking about minority groups when they use that term, but I wondered, you know, is that still a relevant and useful way to look at this election? Is this election really about identity? FREY: Well, to some degree it is. I mean, I think, you know, what Domenico and Asma had said are both two things that are very important. We're becoming more racially diverse, and the white educated population's important in what's going on, and we see both of this - people identifying with all of those groups - Hispanics, blacks, Asians and sort of college whites. But the other piece of this is that the country is shifting at different paces in different ways. And when we look at the Sunbelt now, we see a lot of those Sunbelt states in democratic - within reach of Democrats. And Barack Obama made that happen in North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado, Nevada and so forth. But on the other side of it, even though the country may be less than 70 percent white in terms of their voters, not the case for Michigan and Ohio and Pennsylvania and Wisconsin - and I think there is the rub. We do have identity politics, but that identity means something different in different parts of the country. MARTIN: Can we talk, Asma, about the Latino vote? We've been hearing, you know, for years this is kind of the sleeping giant, just, you know, about to surge, really become important in our politics. Is that happening this year? KHALID: I think that that is the question on everybody's minds. We've seen in some of the early voting data so far, particularly in Nevada and in Florida, a much larger Hispanic turnout. And I think that that could suggest larger participation in the overall Latino vote, but that - I don't know that we'll really know the final answer until Election Day - right? - because these could be Hispanics who are just showing up at an earlier point to vote. I think a lot of analysts will say that they don't think that that's the case that Donald Trump has really energized the Latino community in ways. And if we look at Florida, in particular, I mean, it's really interesting. The Clinton camp was just saying that they're seeing Hispanic turnout that is over 100 percent higher at this point than what they saw in 2012. MARTIN: Domenico, what about black voters? MONTANARO: Black voters are key to - they're a key pillar for the Democratic Party. And, you know, when Bill talks about the Midwest and especially the upper Midwest, you think about places like Michigan and Wisconsin. You know, Barack Obama outpaced his white share of the electorate. He won 44 percent of white voters in Michigan, but he was buoyed unquestionably by black voters in that state. That's why you see Obama going back to Michigan now, why you see him - why you see the Clinton campaign going to be in Philadelphia and in Detroit. These are places where if the blue wall were to hold, it's because of black voters in large measure and the Clinton campaign knows it has to get them out to vote and get them fired up. MARTIN: Now, Frey, I'm going to go back to you on this, and if I have time, Asma, I'm going to ask you about millennials. But, Bill, I wanted to ask you at the beginning of our conversation I asked if there's one data point that you think people should be thinking about. I wanted to ask you that question as a person who's been looking at this for such a long time. FREY: Well, you know, I think one thing that's relevant to this election is turnout. In the 2012 election, blacks had a higher turnout rate than whites in the United States. And that's important for those Midwest states where the black population is the bigger part of the minority populations. So I think that's one thing to watch. Will that turnout stay the same? And will it get higher for Hispanics who only had about a 50 percent turnout last time? Will that be boosted upward? I think those two things are going to be very important to look at on Tuesday. MARTIN: Asma, what about millennials? And I'm not going to you on this just because you are one. KHALID: (Laughter) Because I am an older millennial. MARTIN: Because you are one but millennials are taking over now. This is the biggest group. You've displaced the baby boomers. And... KHALID: Yeah. They have, and everyone keeps saying that, you know, will they show up on Election Day because if all the millennials did show up on Election Day, they really could rival the political power of baby boomers. But, look, historically folks who are younger voters just don't show up at the same rates. And I would say that's not really unique to millennials. When we look at Gen-Xers or even some of the baby boomers when they were younger, they had the same participation levels. MARTIN: Why did you point at me? Why did she point at me... (LAUGHTER) KHALID: I think the one big question about this election cycle that we've heard is that throughout the primary season, Bernie Sanders really resonated with some of these younger voters. And will Hillary Clinton be able to pull out the same kind of margins of victory that Barack Obama did? Certainly, you know, millennials are definitely trending toward the Democratic Party. I think all of the polls confirm that. The question is just will she have the same margins that - margins of victory. MARTIN: Domenico, final thought... MONTANARO: But they are huge. They are a huge bloc. They're bigger than Gen X. They are going to start now over the next 35 years to be the dominant political force in American politics. MARTIN: That's NPR's Asma Khalid and NPR political editor Domenico Montanaro. We were also joined by Bill Frey, demographer at the Brookings Institution. Thank you all so much for your work throughout this election season. Thank you for being here today. MONTANARO: Always a pleasure. KHALID: You're welcome. FREY: Sure. Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.

            "article_content": "If there's one person who's spent some time thinking about how to beat Donald Trump \u2014 and wishing he'd played it differently \u2014 it's Rick Tyler, the former spokesperson for Ted Cruz's campaign.  DAVID GREENE, HOST: We also have this question, of course, of who will be the next president. And the Republican speaker of the House, Paul Ryan, said in a recent Politico interview that a unified Republican Party, quote, \"can win the White House.\" But he added that he's not necessarily betting on it. More and more Republicans in Washington are betting on it. And if there's one person who has spent a lot of time thinking about Donald Trump's secret recipe for success, it is Rick Tyler. He's the former communications director for Ted Cruz. And we asked him to come by our studios. Rick Tyler, thanks you for coming in and chatting. We appreciate it. RICK TYLER: It's great to be here. GREENE: Well, we're here to talk about Donald Trump... TYLER: Yeah. TYLER: ...Who appears to be the Republican nominee. And I guess, you know, you had a certain vantage point going against him in so many states. What do you see is making him so successful as a candidate so far? TYLER: Well, there's several things. One is - he has captured, really, the working white voter's imagination. I remember with Ted Cruz, we took a bus tour all through the South - what they call the SEC primary - and we saw these same voters come out. They came out in hundreds and sometimes thousands of people. And we got really excited because this is a group of people we wanted to get. And this group of people is a group of people who feels like they haven't been able to get ahead in the economy, probably in the last eight or 10 years. But Donald Trump captured them. GREENE: Well - so what was the key to Trump being able to do that and his opponents not winning over these voters? TYLER: He vanquished 14 politicians and two non-politicians. And the reason he did it is because Donald Trump is simply living out his brand. He's just being who he is. We expect him to be who he is. And so when he says things that are rather shocking, they don't seem very shocking because Donald Trump said them. And we're used to him saying them. GREENE: But let's pick this apart a little bit. TYLER: Yeah. GREENE: I mean, if one thing Donald Trump has done is seem authentic - like, seem like he's just talking as if he's Donald Trump - is there a lesson for people in politics about - that's what voters want? Is it a lesson that - maybe you could have advised Ted Cruz to sort of just be more himself? Is that something Hillary Clinton might learn from and try to be more herself if that's what voters want? TYLER: If she remembers who herself is, maybe. There's a moment in the campaign that I think is very emblematic. And it's when Ted Cruz crosses the street and approaches a Donald Trump voter. And what was really interesting about that is - Ted Cruz is a trained prosecutor. He knows how to present the facts and the evidence. And if you are rational and listen to Ted Cruz, you could very well be persuaded 'cause he is very convincing. The Trump supporter did not listen to Ted Cruz. And I'm not going to engage with you on that because I'm not - I will lose a debate with Ted Cruz. So I'll just chant Trump. And he did that. And that is the only debate that Ted Cruz lost in this election cycle. GREENE: But isn't - I mean, if this is a voter who might have just wanted to not be talking to a prosecutor, is there some lesson there for people who have been in politics for a long time - about something they might do? TYLER: Absolutely. I think you have to come across as authentic and real. And a lot of politicians have trouble doing that because it's just not been the conventional way that you would run for office. GREENE: So Donald Trump could win this election with largely just huge numbers among working-class, white male voters. Is that what you're saying? TYLER: Yeah. It's ironic because if you think about the report that the RNC issued called the autopsy, oddly enough, it talked about reaching out to Hispanics and African-Americans. In fact, Trump is really not underperforming them compared to the dismal numbers that Republicans typically get in those groups. He's holding his own. But if Mitt Romney had gotten three more percent of the white vote, he would have won. And this is - there's two candidates now that have the working white voter. One is Donald Trump. And the other is Bernie Sanders. And if Hillary Clinton can't keep Bernie Sanders's white voters on her team - if they choose not to vote or worse, vote for Donald Trump - she's going to lose. GREENE: If you were to advise Hillary Clinton's campaign... TYLER: (Laughter). GREENE: I'm not suggesting that is any - that is likely to happen at any point in any time in the near future, but what's the single most important piece of advice you would give to that campaign? TYLER: You've got to learn to dominate the news cycle. Donald Trump got up every morning and said something on Twitter that captured the news cycle's imagination. Then he would call in to the morning shows and own the day. And that's something that Hillary has not been willing to do. She's not been accessible to the press, historically. She's going to have to figure out how to be better at that game than he is. GREENE: Rick Tyler, thanks a lot. TYLER: Appreciate it.

The Republican Party heads into 2017 with more power than it has had for a long time. For the Democrats, it's a different matter. Hillary Clinton's loss in the presidential race and Democratic failures further down the ballot have the party searching for a way forward. Here are five things Democrats need to do, as they look for a path out of the political wilderness: 1. Be clear about how bad things are \u2014 and are not \u2014 for the Democratic Party. Democrats are clear-eyed about the size of the hole they're in. It's deep. Every president loses seats for his party, but no president in U.S. history has presided over bigger losses than Barack Obama. In the eight years he's been in office, Democrats have lost so many seats at every level of government that they now have fewer elected officials nationwide than at any time since the 1920s. Not only are they in the minority in every branch of government in Washington, but beyond the beltway Democrats have a \"trifecta\" \u2014 control of both state houses and the governor's mansion \u2014 in only 6 states. Republicans have total control of state government in 25 states. Democrats are facing even more headwinds in 2018. The party in power usually loses seats in midterm elections, so Democrats should expect to pick up some seats. But while they may defeat a handful of Republicans in the House, the Senate map looks terrible for them \u2014 25 Senate Democrats are up in 2018, and 10 of them are defending seats in states Donald Trump won. Republicans, on the other hand, have only eight senators up for reelection \u2014 mostly in safe red states. But there is a silver lining for Democrats, sort of. They have 48 seats in the Senate. They can still filibuster at least \u2014 unless Republicans change the rules altogether. Hillary Clinton also did win the popular vote by around 2.1 percentage points and almost 3 million votes. This election was not a repudiation of Democrats' ideology. Their base is the rising American electorate \u2014 young people, African-Americans, single women, Hispanics, all parts of the voting population that are growing. The Republican base is older, whiter, non-college educated, more rural \u2014 groups that are declining in relative numbers. Trump won by squeezing more out of a shrinking piece of the electoral pie. Democrats may be limping out of the 2016 election, but they have long-term advantages if they can figure out how to harness them. 2. First things first: Get a message on the economy. As Democrats form the circular firing squad that is the time-honored tradition of losing parties, they have many different scapegoats \u2014 James Comey? Vladimir Putin? Bernie Sanders? Bill Clinton and Loretta Lynch? Anthony Weiner? But most Democrats agree on one thing: They need an economic message. Hillary Clinton didn't have one. The Democrats' dilemma is sometimes described as a choice between appealing to their young, multicultural base or to white, working-class voters. But most Democrats believe that's a false choice. They need a message on the economy that cuts across class and racial lines, that can appeal to the young person saddled with college debt and the union worker (or former union worker) whose plant has moved to Mexico. Many Trump supporters were once Obama voters, and Democrats say they can win enough of those voters back if they focus their message on bread-and-butter issues. As one Democratic operative summed it up, \"More emphasis on jobs, less on transgender bathrooms.\" Democrats need to develop their own nationalist economic message without the nativism. 3. Figure out how to resist Trump in Congress. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of California and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York have a choice \u2014 they can take a page out of Mitch McConnell's playbook and commit themselves to total obstruction. (The Senate Republicans' leader famously said in a 2010 National Journal interview, \"The single most important thing we want to achieve is for President Obama to be a one-term president.\") Or they can pick and choose their fights, working with Trump where he supports their long-held goals \u2014 on a big infrastructure program, for instance. For now, Democratic congressional leaders seem to have settled on drawing a bright line of resistance when it comes to tax cuts for the rich or Medicare privatization. That kind of fight unites the Bernie Sanders-Elizabeth Warren wing of the party and red-state incumbents up for reelection like Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota. Right now, Democrats don't seem too worried about Obamacare. They're just sitting back and watching while Republicans try to figure out how to repeal it without forcing millions of people to lose their health insurance. Democrats are convinced the Republicans' strategy of \"repeal and delay\" (putting an \"expiration date\" on Obamacare of two or three years into the future to buy time for replacing it) won't work. And Democrats in the Senate need to prioritize their confirmation fights. That might mean energizing their base with a big fight against climate change skeptic Scott Pruitt for EPA, rather than Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson for secretary of state. And all along the way, Democrats will be trying to convince Trump's working-class supporters that they've been played \u2014 by an administration stocked with Wall Street bankers and plutocrats. 4. Rebuild your farm team. One of the consequences of losing big in the midterm elections of 2010 and 2014 is that the Democratic bench is decimated. Midterm elections are the time when the majority of elected offices in the country are filled. While Republicans are able to turn out their voters every two years, Democrats seem only able to turn out their voters every four. That needs to change. Democrats need to restock their pipeline with candidates for city council, mayor, state legislature and governor \u2014 and they need to do it all across the country. It's true that Democratic voters are inefficiently distributed geographically for the purposes of electing members of Congress or the Electoral College. Democrats' advantage in the national popular vote is just a consolation prize. There are too many Democratic voters massed together in urban areas on the East and West coasts. But as Obama said in his last press conference, the Democratic Party can't just be \"coastal, liberal, latte-sipping, politically correct, out-of-touch folks.\" Obama has indicated that electing down-ballot Democrats will be a priority of his post-presidential years. (It's also something many Democrats think he neglected for the last eight years.) He will be working with Eric Holder, his former attorney general, on the National Democratic Redistricting Committee to help Democrats reverse their losses in the states. This is urgent if Democrats hope to have any say in how congressional and legislative district lines are drawn by governors and state legislatures after the next census in 2020. 5. Don't even think about the next presidential race. One of the big consequences of Hillary Clinton losing the 2016 election is that the Democratic Party has no natural national leaders after Obama leaves office next month. But that's OK. Right now, the party needs a message and a permanent infrastructure that can turn out its voters every two years \u2014 more than it needs a field of ready candidates to take on Trump in 2020.",

Below, he and Jennifer Haigh recommend books about a range of American experiences.\n                \n                    \n                    NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption \"Anger isn't something that is solely a rural, American, white guy emotion,\" says novelist Nickolas Butler. Below, he and Jennifer Haigh recommend books about a range of American experiences. Even after the Electoral College officially made Donald Trump our next president, a lot of Americans are still wondering how it happened. In part, working-class anger is said to have fueled Trump's victory; and to understand where that anger is coming from, some people are turning to books. Works of nonfiction, like the J.D. Vance's Hillbilly Elegy, are shooting to the top of best-seller lists, and Daniel Halpern, the publisher of Ecco books, is already fielding book proposals about the election and Trump's presidency. So far, they've all been nonfiction, but fiction can also help explain how we got here. Fiction may take longer to write, but it also goes deeper. According to Halpern, it \"gets into the bloodstream.\" \"I think we read a novel in a very different way than we read a book of nonfiction,\" he says. \"... It can explain things in a way that just the facts cannot do.\" One of Halpern's authors, Jennifer Haigh, has written three novels about a fictional version of her hometown in Pennsylvania's coal country. She says, \"I write about this region I have great love for, and I love this region the way I love family. That is to say: It delights me and also infuriates me and breaks my heart.\" Haigh herself is still trying to sort out her own feelings about the election. She's unhappy her home state went for Trump, but she also sees how people in cities like Boston, where she lives now, have the wrong idea about people who live in coal country. These are not gullible people; they're, in fact, deeply cynical people who have been through generational hardship. Jennifer Haigh \"I take issue with the portrait of these people as gullible rubes who've been taken in by a slick salesman,\" she says. \"These are not gullible people; they're, in fact, deeply cynical people who have been through generational hardship.\" Haigh writes about that generational hardship in her most recent novel, Heat and Light. It's about what happens when fracking comes to what used to be coal country, but she says it's also about this country's cultural divide: \"differences between urban culture and rural culture, and differences between highly educated people and less educated people, and differences of class. And all of that is the crux of that novel. And it really is, I think, central to our current moment.\" Author Nickolas Butler lives in rural Wisconsin. He says, \"Anger isn't something that is solely a rural, American, white guy emotion.\" His new novel, The Hearts of Men (March 2017), is all about being a good man. He wrote it, in part, during the long, divisive presidential campaign. He says the hostile political rhetoric inspired him to include some scenes where a single mom, Rachel, gets caught up in a discussion with a group of men \u2014 \"angry, white, rural men.\" \"She's trying to have a political conversation, trying to understand where this anger is coming from,\" Butler explains. \"And, you know, I think a lot of those characters are regurgitating what they see on social media or AM radio. They're being stoked.\" Butler says he included that heated discussion because he wants readers to understand both sides. \"It's very important to me that they identify with this Rachel character and feel some sort of empathy with her, but just as much to try and complicate the characters that she doesn't understand. What are their jobs? How did they get here? What's their education look like?\" Jennifer Haigh says seeing life from different perspectives is exactly what writing and reading novels is all about. She calls it \"extreme empathy.\" \"It's really the best technology we have to get inside another person's mind,\" she says. \"There is no better way to see through somebody else's eyes than by reading fiction. So I think in a moment like right now, after we've just experienced this very divisive election, which seems to me like the ultimate failure of empathy, that now more than ever it's important for us to read searchingly, to read about people who are nothing like ourselves.\" (She and Butler recommend specific books below.) If there aren't any black folks in your small town, if there aren't any Latino people in your small town or First Nations people, I hope you're getting out and reading their books, reading their art. Nickolas Butler Butler says nonfiction is great, and he plans to read a lot of it in the coming months, but fiction can touch an emotional nerve in a way that nonfiction can't. \"If there aren't any black folks in your small town, if there aren't any Latino people in your small town or First Nations people, I hope you're getting out and reading their books, reading their art,\" he says. \"And I think, likewise, if you're, you know, sitting in a cafe in Brooklyn and you're scratching your head trying to figure out why it is that a person can start walking in Florida and get all the way to Idaho without touching a blue county, maybe you should read something that's coming out of that part of the world.\" Butler knows a lot of people can't afford to buy a brand new hardcover book, but he says there's always the library \u2014 and that's open to everyone.

There were two major assumptions about Latino voters throughout the presidential campaign: (1) a record number of Latinos would show up on Election Day to oppose Donald Trump's candidacy and (2) the anti-immigration rhetoric that launched Trump's campaign would push conservative-leaning Hispanics to flee the Republican Party. Neither of those assumptions entirely panned out as expected. Prediction 1: The Surge? True. A record number of Latinos did vote this November. But the truth is complicated. The official national exit poll, the one commissioned by the big media organizations, suggests the Latino share of the electorate was higher than ever before \u2014 about 11 percent, compared to 10 percent in 2012. \"It's very possible that the Latino vote, while reaching a record, may have been swamped by other groups of voters,\" said Mark Hugo Lopez, the director of Hispanic Research at the Pew Research Center, pointing to states like Florida which Trump won. We won't know the percentage of Latinos who participated in the 2016 election until Census data is released in the spring. But for some background, 48 percent of eligible Hispanic voters turned out in the 2012 election, down from 49.9 percent in 2008. Lopez says it's highly likely Latino turnout saw a small uptick this November, just based on sheer population growth. \"Although how much of a slight uptick remains to be seen,\" he said. \"It's unlikely the Hispanic voter turnout rate matched that of whites or matched that of blacks ... It doesn't seem like there was a Trump effect or a surge in Latino voter participation that many analysts were expecting.\" For some comparison, in the last three presidential elections, both whites and blacks had voter turnout that was at or above 60 percent. Prediction 2: The Runaway Republican Latino voters go to the polls for early voting at the Miami-Dade Government Center on October 21, 2004 in Miami, Florida. A key constituency in Florida, many wondered how conservative Latinos would vote after now President-elect Trump's remarks on immigration.\n                \n                    \n                    Gaston De Cardenas/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Latino voters go to the polls for early voting at the Miami-Dade Government Center on October 21, 2004 in Miami, Florida. A key constituency in Florida, many wondered how conservative Latinos would vote after now President-elect Trump's remarks on immigration. Unlike the surge, which is still awaiting Census data confirmation, prediction No. 2 has data \u2014 so we'll spend more time on it. Months ago on a reporting trip to Orlando, I met Anthony Suarez, a Republican lawyer from Florida. He's the president of the Puerto Rican Bar Association. He knows the local Puerto Rican community well, so he was anxious about Trump's candidacy and what it would mean for his fellow Latino Republicans. In fact, he had this bold, ominous prediction: \"I thought that the rhetoric coming out of Donald Trump was so toxic, that it would eventually turn off the Hispanic community as Barry Goldwater turned off the African-American community.\" Anthony Suarez was worried his fellow Republican Hispanics would flee the GOP this year because of Donald Trump. He voted for Hillary Clinton\n                \n                    \n                    Asma Khalid/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Anthony Suarez was worried his fellow Republican Hispanics would flee the GOP this year because of Donald Trump. He voted for Hillary Clinton Goldwater's opposition to civil rights in the 1960s is one reason black voters make up the base of the Democratic Party today. (Roughly 90 percent supported Clinton this past November). But, on election night, Suarez, who voted for Hillary Clinton, never witnessed that Goldwater moment. Instead, he found himself surrounded by people he described as \"Trump Hispanics\" at a party for a local Republican candidate. \"It certainly was more than I would have thought,\" Suarez said. \"I was surprised to see it.\" Suarez miscalculated, but so did a lot of analysts. Maybe the big lesson from 2016 is that a solid number of Latinos are conservative, and they will consistently vote for Republicans. Roughly 30 percent of Hispanics chose a Republican candidate in each of the last three election cycles. According to the official exit poll, Trump performed roughly on par with Republican Mitt Romney, capturing 28 percent of the Latino vote, though that number is up for debate. Most notably, the polling firm Latino Decisions conducted an Election Eve poll that showed only 18 percent of Latinos chose Trump. (Two of the primary analysts with Latino Decisions \u2014 Matt Barreto and Gary Segura \u2014 did polling for the Clinton campaign though they were walled off from the firm's work during the campaign). Frankly, regardless of which statistic is correct \u2014 28 percent or 18 \u2014 the truth is that a substantial number of Hispanics voted for Trump. And one major reason is religion. \"For most Latinos, not only Hispanic evangelicals, family values are important, social values are important,\" said Pastor Mario Bramnick, a Trump surrogate from South Florida. \"There was this real skew toward religious liberties in the last eight years of the Obama administration,\" Bramnick said. \"And, Mr. Trump said, 'You guys are losing your right to speak,' and he said, 'If I become president ... you will have your right to speak like everybody else.'\" Trump made a concerted effort to reach out to Latino conservative Christians, creating a Hispanic advisory council and meeting with ministers. Both of his sons visited Latino congregations on the final Sunday before the election. And, presumably, at least some of this outreach paid off. Joseph Adorno voted for Trump but would have preferred a candidate like Marco Rubio or Ben Carson. For Adorno, a vote for Trump was essentially a vote for party loyalty and Christian values.\n                \n                    \n                    Asma Khalid/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Joseph Adorno voted for Trump but would have preferred a candidate like Marco Rubio or Ben Carson. For Adorno, a vote for Trump was essentially a vote for party loyalty and Christian values. \"So, I ended up voting for Donald Trump 'cause I thought he was closer to the values that I have,\" said 23-year-old Joseph Adorno with a sigh. And then he added, \"I mean, he's obviously not perfect.\" Adorno would have much rather preferred a candidate like Marco Rubio or Ben Carson. For Adorno, a vote for Trump was essentially a vote for party loyalty and Christian values. \"I guess it's more about the Republican Party in a way,\" he said. \"You know, the person that was gonna be elected would nominate a lot of people in power, like the judges, and I felt [Trump] would nominate more conservative judges.\" But, for other Latinos, like Orlando Diaz, 33, from Maryland, a vote for Trump wasn't about party loyalty; in fact, it was the polar opposite feeling \u2014 that Trump defied traditional party affiliation. \"In my eyes, I did see Trump as a different kind of Republican,\" said Diaz, who up until this election season was a registered Democrat. Diaz had voted for President Obama, but was no fan of Clinton as the Democratic nominee this year. \"What I saw in Hillary Clinton was just more of the same. And what I saw in Trump was change,\" Diaz said. \"When Bernie wasn't nominated that's pretty much when I knew I was gonna go over to Donald Trump.\" Diaz said, in particular, he liked the way Trump spoke about the Department of Defense and veterans. He saw Trump as a man of strength, and he liked that. \"I have 12 years of service in the army,\" Diaz said. \"One of the things that President-elect Trump has mentioned is that he wants to increase the size of the Army, which I think is necessary during the situations that are going on right now in the world.\" Immigration wasn't the threshold issue Democrats hoped it would be For Adorno, a vote for Trump was about values; for Diaz, a vote for Trump was about veterans and \"change.\" There was an assumption that Trump's immigration rhetoric would have been a threshold issue. But it wasn't. Diaz, like other Trump-supporting Latinos, was well-aware of Trump's comments about Mexican immigrants and a border wall, but he didn't take them personally. \"Me, as a Puerto Rican, I did not really think he was addressing the entire Hispanic community,\" Diaz said. \"The term Hispanic identifies maybe around 18 or 19 countries that speak Spanish. I didn't feel that, me, as a Puerto Rican, that I was part of that group he was talking about.\" Still, he wishes Trump would have worded some of his remarks differently, and he understands why some Latinos were bothered. \"I definitely understand how it could alienate people and how people could take it as offensive,\" he said. And, it wasn't only Diaz who thought this. Nearly every Trump-supporting Latino I interviewed told me some version of \u2014 well, clearly Trump wasn't talking about all Hispanics. \"It didn't trouble me at all because he was talking about people who had come across the U.S. illegally,\" said Julian Camacho, a Trump voter from California. Camacho's family has roots in Mexico, but they've lived in the United States for generations. Even for some new immigrants, like Flaminio Guerrero from Colombia, the immigration issue wasn't a deal-breaker. Guerrero now lives in Georgia, where he recently became a citizen. This November was the first presidential election in which he was eligible to vote. \"I understand Mexicans when they get offended,\" Guerrero said. \"But, at the same time, when I first came to America, every time someone asked me, 'Where are you from?' And, if I would say Colombia, immediately they would think of drugs.\" Initially, Guerrero said that stereotype bothered him. \"I was ashamed,\" he said. \"But at the same time, I could not call these people racist, because they're just facing a reality.\" Guerrero said the truth is \u2014 in the days when he first moved to the United States, Colombia was exporting a lot of drugs. \"Most of us, on the minority groups, get offended for things that in reality are actually true,\" he said. \"We have to learn to own our sins.\" And, besides, for him, a vote for Trump wasn't really about immigration, it was about the economy. \"I liked the fact that he's not an insider; he comes from the outside; he comes from the business world,\" Guerrero said. \"He knows how to negotiate.\" A Latino floor for Republicans Perhaps the lesson is that any generic GOP candidate will always get a guaranteed percentage of the Latino vote. \"It's possible that there is a floor among Latinos for Republicans, and that may be somewhere around 20 to 25 percent,\" said Mark Hugo Lopez with the Pew Research Center. But, he added, the candidate still matters. \"The right candidate can perhaps adjust that floor up or down.\" Lopez thinks there's a bigger lesson. He points out that for years, pundits have said that a Republican candidate needs at least 40 percent of the Hispanic vote to win the White House. But... \"A Republican candidate won the White House without 40 percent or more of the Hispanic vote,\" he noted. \"Perhaps this election only goes to show you that the Hispanic vote, while growing in importance, is not the decider of national elections.\" If you think about this another way, Clinton was on par with Obama levels of Hispanic support in 2008, capturing two-thirds of the Latino vote, but still lost the election. So, although the demographics of the country are changing, and every year, Latinos are becoming a larger share of the population, for now, it's possible to win less than a third of the Latino vote, and still win the presidency.

            "article_content": "President Obama sees a role for himself in rebuilding the Democratic Party after he leaves office \u2014 coach. \"What I am interested in is just developing a whole new generation of talent,\" Obama told NPR's Steve Inskeep in an interview on Morning Edition. \"There are such incredible young people who not only worked on my campaign, but I've seen in advocacy groups,\" Obama said. \"I've seen passionate about issues like climate change, or conservation, criminal justice reform. You know, campaigns to \u2014 for a livable wage, or health insurance. And making sure that whatever resources, credibility, spotlight that I can bring to help them rise up. That's something that I think I can do well, I think Michelle can do well.\" There are clearly, though, failures on our part to give people in rural areas or in ex-urban areas, a sense day-to-day that we're fighting for them or connected to them.\" President Obama The Democrats' deep hole They'll have their work cut out for them. Republicans will control the House, Senate and White House when President-elect Donald Trump is sworn in Jan. 20. That's a reversal of the situation Obama found himself in when he took office eight years ago \u2014 the peak of massive Democratic electoral gains at the end of the Bush administration. And on the state level, Republicans head into 2017 with 33 out of 50 governors \u2014 more than in nearly 100 years. The GOP will have complete control of the governors' offices and state legislatures in 25 states, while Democrats will hold complete control in just six states. Republicans solidified gains that started in 2010 by drawing favorable congressional and statehouse districts in many states during the redistricting process. Democrats find themselves in a deep hole after an election that most party officials expected to win. Obama told NPR that he disagreed with suggestions the party should change its policy platforms, instead attributing losses to messaging and strategy. \"I don't think there's something wrong with the core argument that the Democratic Party has made for years,\" the president said. \"And the reason we know that is because on the individual issues that Democrats talk about there's strong support. For example, the minimum wage. In every survey across the country, people support a higher minimum wage. There are clearly, though, failures on our part to give people in rural areas or in ex-urban areas, a sense day-to-day that we're fighting for them or connected to them.\" The president said his party has \"ceded too much territory\" to Republicans in local races. \"I am a proud Democrat,\" he said, \"but I do think that we have a bias towards national issues and international issues.\" It's the economy Obama blamed part of that on the political conversation, and what topics are magnified during campaigns. Voters, he said, \"may know less about the work that my administration did on trying to promote collective bargaining or overtime rules. But they know a lot about the controversy around transgender bathrooms. Because it's more controversial, it attracts more attention.\" On strategy, Obama acknowledged that it was apparent soon after he entered the White House in 2009 that the successful campaign structure that got him elected to the presidency wasn't going to work for candidates down the ballot, but that the economic crash at the time meant the political spade work didn't receive enough attention. \"We were in a huge crisis situation, and so a lot of the organizing work that we did during the campaign, we started to see right away didn't immediately translate to, wasn't immediately transferable to congressional candidates,\" Obama said. \"More work would have needed to be done to just build up that structure.\" Republicans made significant gains during midterm years when Obama's name was not on the ballot and his campaign wasn't in the field, taking control of the House in 2010 and the Senate in 2014. Competing for rural voters As he's done before, though, Obama also faulted Democrats for failing to compete \u2014 or even show up, at times \u2014 in rural areas. He talked about campaigning in rural Illinois while running for Senate and making repeated visits to Republican-friendly corners of Iowa during the 2008 campaign, \"and just sitting down in people's living rooms and VFW halls and at fish fries and listening to people.\" \"Which meant that in 2012,\" the president continued, \"I might still lose the overall vote and some of these counties or some of these voting districts but I might lose 55-45 or 60-40, rather than 80-20.\" They may know less about the work that my administration did on trying to promote collective bargaining or overtime rules. But they know a lot about the controversy around transgender bathrooms.\" President Obama Narrower losses in just a handful of rural counties could have put Hillary Clinton in the White House, as she lost Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan each by less than 1 percent. While Clinton has been criticized for not keeping up a busier campaign schedule, particularly in those industrial Midwestern states, she spent much of the early part of her campaign holding listening sessions with voters, and immediately following the Democratic National Convention, she went on a bus tour through the very parts of Ohio and Pennsylvania she has been criticized for not giving enough attention. Many of those conversations informed the issues and messages Clinton's campaign focused on, most notably opioid addiction and a plan to help people in coal country affected by job losses. But after that bus tour she didn't again put in a sustained effort to win over white, working class voters. Critical to the Democratic playbook in industrial states involves running up voting margins in urban areas. When turnout dropped in urban areas, but rose in rural counties, those key states flipped Republican for the first time in decades. Also in his conversation with NPR, Obama spoke of the need for Americans to pin their hopes for the country to more than who wins the White House every four years. \"If we either celebrate or despair just around presidential elections, without spending enough time focusing on how, in our day-to-day lives, in our local civic lives, in our media, in our culture,\" Obama said. \"If we're not spending enough time reflecting on, 'What am I doing to be part of the solution as opposed to being part of the problem?' Then we'll get better presidents and worse presidents, but we're not going to get to where we need to go.\"",

Even before he is sworn in, Donald Trump is putting his own stamp on the role of chief executive. That has some people rejoicing \u2014 and others worried about where he's going to take the country. Here is why some of Trump's critics say the president-elect could be a threat to democratic institutions and why others say those fears are overblown. Trump is shaping up to be more than just an activist president. With one tweet, he drives down the stock price of a major American company. With another, he unleashes a flood of death threats against a local labor leader who displeased him. Evan McMullin, a former Republican House staffer and CIA operative who ran as an independent for president against Trump, points to Trump's intervention with the Carrier company. Trump's involvement led to Carrier agreeing to keep 750 jobs in the U.S. instead of moving them to Mexico. McMullin charged that the Carrier deal showed that Trump has authoritarian instincts. \"The most fundamental part of authoritarianism is this idea that what the authoritarian believes should go,\" McMullin told NPR. \"They are the only authority. It's the president making decisions about particular companies rather than working within the system to create laws that affect companies in the context of the rule of law.\" But others, even critics of Trump, say the Carrier deal was not necessarily a sign of a populist authoritarian in the making \u2014 it was merely bad economic policy. Wall Street Journal columnist Bret Stephens, a Trump critic, said the president-elect is giving new meaning to the bully part of the bully pulpit. \"It just sets a dangerous precedent that a president can take a private company by the throat,\" Stephens said. \"It's not what you'd expect from a guy who supposedly believes in the power that supports free markets.\" And, say others, it was a pretty lousy deal \u2014 since Carrier has announced it plans to automate the plant and lay off even more workers. But Trump's supporters say his intervention with Carrier shows Trump is a strong leader \u2014 doing exactly what he promised to do during the campaign. Conservative talk-show host Laura Ingraham, who is in contention for White House press secretary, said what Trump did, when he reminded Carrier's parent company about its defense contracts with the federal government and got the company to accept the package of incentives the state of Indiana was already offering, was well within the bounds of executive action. \"Giving companies incentives to stay in states, as you see governors do all the time,\" Ingraham said, \"what's wrong with that? What's wrong with doing things that actually help regular, working-class Americans and that are popular?\" But the debate about Trump and democracy doesn't stop there. His critics say they can find no instance where Trump spoke in defense of democratic institutions or values. During the campaign he questioned the ability of a U.S.-born judge with Mexican parents to preside fairly over a lawsuit against him. Trump was suggesting that being an American has more to do with ethnic heritage than shared values. Over the weekend, Trump cast doubt on U.S. intelligence and said he doesn't plan to take daily intelligence briefings. He has repeatedly sided with Russia, casting doubt that Russians hacked Democratic National Committee emails and the emails of Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman John Podesta \u2014 and colluded to release them via WikiLeaks. The CIA concluded Russia did so in an effort to help install Trump as the next U.S. president. Trump dismisses any evidence of that. President Obama has launched a \"full review\" of international meddling related to U.S. elections going back to the 2008 election, when China was found to have hacked both the Obama and McCain campaigns. When it comes to freedom of speech, Trump is famous for his attacks on the media. Those are standard for political candidates, but Trump went even further, threatening to alter libel laws so journalists could be \"sued like they've never been sued before.\" During the campaign, Trump also promised to throw Hillary Clinton in jail. Even after he won, his critics say his magnanimous offer to refrain from prosecuting her showed a lack of understanding of the U.S. democratic system, under which presidents don't get to decide by themselves whom to prosecute, let alone throw in jail. Then there's the ongoing debate about Trump's constant stream of statements that have no basis in fact. Coupled with the torrent of fake news stories (which Trump has repeated), these falsehoods, Trump's critics say, could undermine liberal democracy. Whether stating with zero proof that millions of noncitizens voted illegally, claiming falsely that climate change is a hoax, questioning baselessly (for years) whether Obama was born in the United States, stating that he \"heard\" the unemployment rate might really be 42 percent or that everything people hear from the \"dishonest media\" is a lie, Trump's messages are designed to sow confusion, McMullin said. After all, if citizens can't believe anything they hear, then the easiest path is to just trust the leader. And, Trump has said, \"I alone\" can fix the country's problems. To McMullin, this is a hallmark of authoritarians. He points to Trump's false claim that millions of illegal votes prevented him from winning a popular-vote majority, for example. \"It serves to undermine our democratic institutions,\" McMullin said. \"If those institutions are weakened, if we have less faith, for example, in elections, that strengthens the hand of the authoritarian.\" The response of Trump's supporters to that critique hasn't been what you'd expect. Instead of insisting that Trump is telling the truth, Trump's surrogates, like his former campaign Manager Corey Lewandowski, said falsehoods are just part of Trump's leadership style. \"This is the problem with the media,\" Lewandowski said at a recent Harvard University forum. \"You guys took everything Donald Trump said so literally. And the problem with that is the American people didn't. They understood that sometimes when you have a conversation with people, you're going to say something, and maybe you don't have all the facts to back that up, but that's how the American people live.\" Lewandowski seems to be arguing that since the average American might not know what he's talking about, why should Trump? Other Trump surrogates, like Scottie Nell Hughes, openly embrace Trump's role as the first president operating in a post-factual world. \"There's no such thing, unfortunately, anymore of facts,\" Hughes said recently on The Diane Rehm Show. \"And so Mr. Trump's tweets, amongst a certain crowd, a large \u2014 a large part of the population, are truth.\" The argument that Trump's repeated prevarications pose a threat to democratic institutions, and to American democracy itself, is rejected by former George W. Bush strategist Karl Rove. He dismissed it as nothing more than left-wing hyperventilation. \"This is far-fetched, starting with the authoritarianism,\" Rove told NPR. \"Yes, there are Republicans concerned that he rambunctiously doesn't understand the restraints on the executive, that he doesn't understand the prerogatives under Article 1 that Congress enjoys \u2014 yeah. But the process is going to teach him those constraints \u2014 and reality is going to teach him those constraints.\" Former Clinton White House aide Bill Galston agrees. He points to the checks and balances American founders designed to restrain any president who tries to chip away at rule of law, individual rights, a free press or an independent judiciary. \"I think the next few years will be a kind of stress test for the liberal, democratic constitutional institutions that we have built with such pain and such struggle over the last two-and-a-quarter centuries,\" Galston said. \"I am cautiously optimistic that our institutions will pass that test, but they will be tested.\" This is what the conversation is like at the dawn of the age of Trump, where it's not yet clear what a Trump presidency will mean \u2014 for the economy, foreign policy or democratic institutions.",

She covered demographics and the 2016 campaign. Editor's note: There is language in this piece that some will find offensive. Sometime in early 2016 between a Trump rally in New Hampshire, where a burly man shouted something at me about being Muslim, and a series of particularly vitriolic tweets that included some combination of \"raghead,\" \"terrorist,\" \"bitch\" and \"jihadi,\" I went into my editor's office and wept. I cried for the first (but not the last) time this campaign season. Through tears, I told her that if I had known my sheer existence \u2014 just the idea of being Muslim \u2014 would be a debatable issue in the 2016 election, I would never have signed up to do this job. To friends and family, I looked like a masochist. But I was too invested to quit. I was hired by NPR to cover the intersection of demographics and politics. My job required crisscrossing the country to talk to all kinds of voters. I attended rallies and town halls for nearly every candidate on both sides of the aisle, and I met people in their homes, churches and diners. I am also visibly, identifiably Muslim. I wear a headscarf. So I stand out. And during this campaign, that Muslim identity became the first (and sometimes only) thing people saw, for good or for bad. \"Don't be a martyr\" Sometimes I met voters who questioned the 3-D nature of my life, people who viscerally hated the idea of me. One night an old journalist friend called me and said, \"Look, don't be a martyr.\" It was a strange comment to me, since the harassment seemed more like a nuisance than a legitimate threat. And I knew if I was ever legitimately concerned, I had two options: I could ask for a producer to travel with me, or I wouldn't wear a headscarf. (And a couple of times I didn't.) Without a hijab, I'm incognito, light-skinned enough that I can pass as some sort of generic ethnic curiosity. For many journalists, the 2016 campaign was the story of a lifetime. And it was indeed the story of a lifetime for me, too, but a story with real-life repercussions. And I hung on, because the story of Donald Trump's America is not some foreign story of a faraway place; it's my homeland. Hoosier roots I'm from Indiana. We grew up in a mostly Democratic county. But my town was predominantly white and fairly conservative, a place where the Ten Commandments are engraved in marble outside the old County Courthouse. I loved our childhood \u2014 summers playing basketball, winters sledding. We weren't outsiders \u2014 I sold Girl Scout cookies, was captain of the tennis team. We were part of the club \u2014 or so we thought. And while some folks might not have liked Muslims in the abstract \u2014 most folks liked our family. Maybe we were the exception to the rule. One of the benefits of growing up as a brown girl in an overwhelmingly white town is that you get accustomed to making white folks feel comfortable with you at a young age. It wasn't intentional; it was merely a mode of survival. I suppose it's something you learn inadvertently when your sister is called a \"nigger\" before she even knew what the word meant. And that skill set was perhaps the most valuable tool I brought to this election. So, for example, whenever the Pledge of Allegiance was recited at a GOP event, regardless of whether I was balancing a laptop on my knees, a notebook in one hand and a microphone in the other, I instinctively stood up. I noticed \u2014 sometimes \u2014 my fellow journalists didn't stand; they would finish the email they were writing. But I also knew I couldn't afford to give the people in the room any more reason to doubt me. Later, with some of these same voters, I would share stories about how the pledge was recited every week in my school. And they would trust me a little bit more than before. I watched their eyes widen, as they heard me discuss corn, Hoosier basketball and steel mills. And slowly, within about 15 minutes, the suspicion would evaporate and we would discuss presidential politics. Sure, it was often tiresome to spend so much effort destroying the preconceptions, but it was also a strangely amusing challenge. \"Do you think he's racist?\" At times, it seemed I was an ambassador on this solo goodwill U.S.A. tour. No doubt, for many folks, particularly Trump voters, I was the first Muslim they had ever met. Maybe that's why I got so many curious reactions. Sometimes they were negative \u2014 furtive glances as I walked through an Ohio pumpkin patch to interview people, or the way a middle-aged man physically recoiled when I said \"hello.\" Trump supporters loved to ask me \"Do you think he's racist?\" At his rallies, it was a question I pretended I couldn't hear through my headphones over the din of the music. But it's a question I've often thought was overly simplistic. Did they want affirmation, or was it a proxy for whether they could trust me? Donald Trump did not create the fear of Muslims; he merely tapped into it. Other times, the reactions were just inexplicable \u2014 the GOP leader in Ohio who brought me local maple syrup as a gift for the road and then asked for a hug, or the couple at a Trump event in Florida who invited me to spend the weekend on their boat. Maybe it was cathartic for them, I don't know. These strange moments kept happening throughout my travels. So when I met Joy at a county GOP dinner in Colorado Springs, and she gave me her phone number and invited me to her house for tea, I took her up on the offer. She had wanted to chat casually, and I had some time to spare between afternoon interviews. She told me I was the first journalist she had ever invited to her house. She asked me about my childhood in Indiana; she told me about hers in neighboring Kentucky. She asked me why and how I had become a reporter; she told me about her years as a math teacher. And then she asked me what I thought about the election. And, as a journalist, I deflected. Sitting there at her kitchen counter, eating her homemade chocolate-chip cookies, I realized I was also likely the first Muslim who had ever been in her home. So when is the \"million-man Muslim march\"? But one woman's curiosity can sometimes be another man's threat. Way before Trump entered the race, and GOP primary voters' consciousness, I was in New Hampshire working on a story to gauge reaction to the news that Mitt Romney might run for president again. I met James at the Red Barn Diner in Manchester. He was seated at the counter by himself, eating BBQ roast and mashed potatoes, and sporting a camouflage jacket. NPR's Asma Khalid chats with a student at Elon University in North Carolina.\n                \n                    \n                    NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption NPR's Asma Khalid chats with a student at Elon University in North Carolina. James said he was retired from the Army. He didn't know who he was voting for yet. He said he liked Romney but thought he had been too \"soft\" on President Obama. He also liked Rand Paul, but he wasn't sure. And then suddenly he turned to me and asked in an accusatory tone what I thought of Charlie Hebdo. I must have had this confused look on my face \u2014 because I was wondering how on Earth we got from Romney to France. But I sputtered something about being a journalist, and that I don't think killing journalists is a good idea. He then went further. He asked me: When are all of you Muslims going to have your \"million-man Muslim march\" to condemn terrorism? He said intently, almost friendly \u2014 it was what we \"needed to do.\" Donald Trump did not create the fear of Muslims; he merely tapped into it. In that moment with James, I said nothing. I wanted to point out that Muslims have been condemning terrorism for years, but it's my job to hear what voters say, not argue with them. And so I probably smiled awkwardly like I do sometimes \u2014 and tried to pivot back to Mitt Romney. I quickly finished the interview. I'd had enough for one day. On the drive home, the more I thought about James, the more frustrated I became. The world is gray and nuanced, and so often my friends got the benefit of being composite people: Floridian, Catholic, scientist. But often when voters saw me, all they saw was Muslim. They didn't see Hoosier, tennis fiend, fashion-obsessed journo. \"Risk mitigation\" As the campaign dragged on, comments like James' became fairly routine. And that's to say nothing of social media \u2014 Twitter, with its dark anonymity, was especially hostile. (I never retweeted or acknowledged the worst messages, because, frankly, my mom reads my Twitter feed.) Multiple times this campaign season, I deleted the Twitter app off my phone, only to return a day later, because, for a journalist, being off social media is unsustainable. All year long, my single job was to tell the stories of voters. ... I always tried to understand their fears. But, so many times, this empathy felt like a one-way street.\" I had become so accustomed during the campaign to the idea that Muslims were seen as un-American that on the day Trump announced his temporary Muslim ban, I didn't even realize it was news. Initially, I skimmed the email and dumped it into a \"Trump\" folder in my inbox. Then I met Jared at a Trump volunteer training in South Florida. He was the tech guy, running the audiovisuals. He had this intensity about him. And he warned me with a serious laugh that if I misquoted him in any way, he would make sure to get back to me and let me know. I interviewed Jared and, as I was about to leave, he stopped me. He wanted to tell me one more thing: basically why the temporary Muslim ban was actually good for Muslims like me. Jared wanted me to know that he knew all about Islam. He told me he had spent a year and a half in Egypt, even spoke some Arabic. \"I'm not just some dude,\" he said. I didn't tell him I have a master's degree in Islamic studies from Cambridge. I let him go on. \"I know that there are certain things that it's their mission,\" Jared said of Muslims. \"True believers \u2014 it's their mission.\" Their mission? To \"come here\" and do \"heinous things.\" And, he added, if they're allowed to continue to come into the U.S. and commit violent acts \u2014 and this is where it gets really bad for me \u2014 the U.S. could move toward internment camps. A Muslim ban, in his view, was just \"risk mitigation.\" If there were more attacks by Muslims in the U.S., he said, \"All the horrible Nazi-esque things that people are talking about would happen. You know who would demand it? The entire country.\" He continued, \"If I think my head's going to get cut off, I would be in a defensive mode, wouldn't you?\" Jared seemed to suggest that I was one of the safe ones. How he decided that, I don't know. Maybe it was my Prada sunglasses or my Tory Burch shoes. His logic struck me in contradictory ways \u2014 one, that I was a good American and so should support a Muslim ban to protect my fellow Muslim citizens from internment camps, but, two, that I was a bad Muslim because I didn't believe in killing people. I felt humiliated \u2014 and said nothing. I couldn't. It wasn't my job. But what I would have said is: \"I pray; I fast; I don't steal; I try not to lie \u2014 these are all the basic universal morals that I always thought made for a true believer. And I don't believe in killing people. So, does that make me a bad Muslim?\" When empathy is a one-way street All year long, my single job was to tell the stories of voters. I met a Trump-supporting mom who had lost her son in Afghanistan, an evangelical wife who worried that race relations had gotten worse because of President Obama, a former military man afraid of Muslim terrorists. I always tried to understand their fears. But, so many times, this empathy felt like a one-way street. About a month before the election, I went to Columbus, Ohio. I was particularly curious to hear from white, working-class families \u2014 the types of folks who had once voted Democrat but were increasingly swayed by Trump's message. So I decided to tag along for an evening of door-knocking with the group Working America \u2014 they're affiliated with the AFL-CIO and had endorsed Hillary Clinton. Door-knocking is always slightly awkward for radio reporters. We have giant microphones, and we ask strangers to allow us to record them talking to a canvasser. But I've done enough of these that I've learned when to lean in and when to turn off my mic. And, undoubtedly, you meet some characters when you're knocking on strangers' doors. There was the woman whose house was completely decked out in orange and black for Halloween. And there was the man who told me he could see Satan in Obama's eyes. But, generally, I believed if you're kind to people, they would return the kindness. That is not what happened on a crisp fall evening in Ohio. The young canvasser I was following knocked on a door, and Christina opened the door. She politely explained that \"people maintaining their guns\" was her main priority this election. She continued to answer the canvasser's questions as her mother came to the porch, saw me and started yelling. \"You need to get off of my property,\" she said with a scowl. \"Mom,\" Christina said with exasperation. But her mother repeated herself more clearly and furiously. \"This is my property, and she needs to get off,\" the woman said \u2014 glaring squarely at me. Never mind that there were two of us. And I was not the one asking questions; I was the silent one off to the side. \"Mom, they came here to talk to me,\" Christina explained. And, eventually, her mom relented and went inside. As her mother slammed the door behind her, Christina apologized: \"Sorry, she's not in the best of moods today.\" The canvasser went back to her list of questions, but I could hardly pay attention, because, inside, Christina's mom was still yelling, and I could hear her in the background. \"There's a Muslim on my front porch. It's ... ridiculous,\" she shrieked. If I had been alone, this is the point where I would have just said \"thanks\" and walked away, but I was following a canvasser, and she had more questions to ask, so we stayed. And, again, I did nothing. Because I could do nothing. I had a badge around my neck and a microphone in my hand, so to prove my own humanness seemed like the inappropriate thing to do as a journalist in that moment. At times like this, it was hard to swallow that I felt like some of my own people hated me. And they are my people. I know them, even if they don't know it. I was born in the Midwest, grew up in the Midwest, went to college in the Midwest. This neighborhood, where we were door-knocking even looked like the neighborhood where I had lived as a kid. Maybe it was naive, but my Hoosier upbringing taught me that you could win people over \u2014 if only they got to know you. This woman had reminded me of people I had known all throughout my life. But they never yelled at me to get off their porch. And on this chilly October evening in Columbus, I realized there are people who just don't want to know you, who think they know everything about you before you open your mouth. Looking for America I got to see America this year like I had never seen her before \u2014 traveling to main streets in Iowa, diners in New Hampshire, living rooms in Ohio, county GOP meetings in Colorado, casinos in Nevada, churches in Florida, and so many, many more places across our fascinating country. And for that I'll always be grateful. But I also felt unwelcome in my homeland for the first time. It's something I had never known before. Everywhere I went, I tried to understand voters' frustrations and empathize with their concerns. But the reality is \u2014 empathy isn't always reciprocated.

Nancy Pelosi beat back her toughest challenge yet to her leadership of Democrats in the House of Representatives, defeating Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan to secure another term as House minority leader. The California Democrat got 134 votes to Ryan's 63 in a secret ballot vote on Wednesday. Pelosi had boasted going into the vote that she had support from two-thirds of the caucus, and she received just over that amount. Pelosi, 76, has held the top slot in House Democratic leadership since 2003. She became the first female speaker of the House in history when Democrats won control of Congress in 2006. But since they suffered devastating losses in 2010, the liberal San Francisco congresswoman has faced questions about whether she's the best one to lead the minority party in the House. After Democrats lost 63 seats in 2010, she faced a challenge from then-North Carolina Rep. Heath Shuler, who drew 43 votes. Ryan's 63 votes is the most serious defection she has faced. The debate over who was best to lead the House Democrats, who are now entering their sixth year in the minority, was emblematic of the larger debate over the direction of the party after Hillary Clinton suffered a surprising and stinging loss in the presidential race to Donald Trump. House Democrats had hoped to pick up as many as 15 or 20 seats to cut into Republicans' 30-seat edge. Instead, they flipped only six seats, a disappointing showing to many Democrats. Rep. Tim Ryan, D-Ohio, fell short in his effort to topple Nancy Pelosi as the Democratic House minority leader.\n                \n                    \n                    Bloomberg/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Rep. Tim Ryan, D-Ohio, fell short in his effort to topple Nancy Pelosi as the Democratic House minority leader. Trump's upset came after he was able to win narrow victories in a handful of Rust Belt states, such as Ohio, Wisconsin and Michigan, delivering him the Electoral College votes needed to win the presidency. Many of the seats Democrats were unable to win back also came in more working class, rural areas of those states. Ryan argued that the party needed someone who understands blue collar voters as well as new, younger blood in leadership. The 43-year-old Democrat argued he was better equipped to do that, coming from the manufacturing hub of Youngstown, Ohio. Ryan's home county had even flipped to Trump by six points after previously voting for President Obama by 22 points just four years ago. Pelosi mocked that loss in an interview with the Huffington Post, saying he \"didn't even carry his district for Hillary Clinton.\" But others saw it as a sign that Ryan was the type of Democrat who could win over working class voters better than someone from ultra-liberal San Francisco.",

            "article_content": "Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan says Democrats have lost a connection to working-class voters in the Midwest. Ryan is challenging the woman he considers a mentor, Nancy Pelosi, for leadership of House Democrats.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: The House Democrats pick their leader this week. Democrats in Washington are in their worst position in 10 years. They lost the House again. They missed a chance to retake the Senate. And they lost the presidency and the Electoral College to Donald Trump, although Hillary Clinton's lead in the popular vote continues climbing. She's now ahead by 2.2 million votes, according to the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. In this unsettled moment, Nancy Pelosi aims to keep her job as House minority leader, but a low-key congressman from Ohio is challenging her. From member station WKSU, M.L. Schultze has more. M L SCHULTZE, BYLINE: November 8 should have been a good day for Tim Ryan. He won his eighth term in the U.S. House with his usual two-thirds of the vote, thanks to neighbors like Michelle gray. MICHELLE GRAY: Just about everybody around here loves them him because he's a hometown guy. He's a stand-up guy, and he's always been honest. SCHULTZE: But for the 43-year-old Ryan... TIM RYAN: Tuesday night rocked my world. SCHULTZE: Election night revealed just how many of Ryan's voters also voted for Donald Trump. The Mahoning Valley that Ryan represents recorded one of the largest shifts of voters from Barack Obama to Donald Trump in the nation. RYAN: That really, really bothers me to think about that because of how good the Democratic Party has been for my family. My great grandfather emigrated from Italy, and my grandfather worked in a steel mill and was able to raise kids and have a family and go on vacation. SCHULTZE: Ryan says today's version of his working-class family thinks the Democratic Party is irrelevant or thinks the party finds them irrelevant. So with Congress and the White House in GOP hands, Ryan is challenging the woman he considers a mentor, Nancy Pelosi, for leadership of House Democrats. It's not the first longshot of his political career. He won a seat in the Ohio Senate right out of law school and, at age 29, ran for Congress. He beat a crowded field with an enthusiastic campaign set to the music of The Dave Matthews Band and his fierce opposition to the North American Free Trade Agreement. PAUL SRACIC: That's a Midwest Democratic message. That's not a coastal Democratic message. SCHULTZE: That's Youngstown State political scientist Paul Sracic. SRACIC: You live in California and you live in New York, you're not against these trade agreements. But in the Midwest here, in the old Rust Belt, they are. SCHULTZE: Sracic says, in most ways, Ryan has reflected and projected that Midwest, with a few exceptions. There is that book he wrote that few would expect from a 6-foot-4 politician who still uses metaphors from his days as a star high school quarterback. SRACIC: Over the top, loud, boisterous, sort of, you know, shot-and-a-beer kind of politicians. That's this area. And then for a congressman representing this area to write a book on meditation and mindfulness just seems sort of so out of character. SCHULTZE: But Sracic says Ryan got no grief back home. Meanwhile, in his nearly 14 years in Congress, Ryan won appointments to powerful committees, including appropriations. He brought home the bacon in a region that still values that. And he got a prime speaking slot at this summer's Democratic National Convention. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) RYAN: We respect the men and women who punch a clock, the ones who shower after they get home from the job. We respect the fighters who go to work early, stay late and pour their hearts into what they do. SCHULTZE: Mahoning County Democratic Party Chairman Dave Betras says the national Democrats should have picked up on that theme. Instead... DAVE BETRAS: We're so off-message that a billionaire is talking to our voters. We have to change the narrative. You know, we have to change the players that are on the field. SCHULTZE: For Betras, Tim Ryan is the player Democrats need on the field. And with apologies for quoting Donald Trump, he adds, what have you got to lose? For NPR News, I'm M.L. Schultze.

            "article_content": "French conservatives choose their candidate for President on Sunday. The winner will likely face off against Marine Le Pen of the far-right National Front in the presidential election next year.  SCOTT SIMON, HOST: France's conservative party will select a candidate for president tomorrow. The country's presidential election will be held next spring. France has mainstream parties, kind of like the United States, one on the left, one on the right. But the deep unpopularity of Francois Hollande's Socialist Party makes the conservative primary especially crucial. NPR's Eleanor Beardsley explains why. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED CANDIDATE: (Speaking French). NATHALIE KOSCIUSKO-MORIZET: (Speaking French). ELEANOR BEARDSLEY, BYLINE: Seven candidates, six men and one woman, faced off in their last live televised debate on Thursday evening. From the very first question, Donald Trump's upset victory was a major theme. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED MODERATOR: (Speaking French). BEARDSLEY: \"Anti-elite movements elected Trump and pushed through Brexit,\" said the moderator. \"What will be the effects of this on France?\" (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED CANDIDATE: (Speaking French). BEARDSLEY: While one candidate pointed out that it wasn't Trump who invaded Iraq and sowed chaos in the Middle East, the others spent the evening assuring voters they stood as a barrier to the kind of raw populism that got Trump elected. France has its own far-right party, the National Front. Its leader, Marine Le Pen, shares the same anti-immigration, anti-globalization platform as Trump. Now many French fear she stands a real chance at becoming president. Thierry Arnaud is the chief political analyst at BFMTV News. THIERRY ARNAUD: She is a very popular politician. She leads a party that is, by far, the biggest party for the French working class. So her electoral base is incredibly strong, solid. And she's almost guaranteed something around 25 percent of the votes in the first round of the French presidential election. And that is extremely tough to beat. BEARDSLEY: The French elect a president in two stages. Voters often use the first round to cast a protest vote and vote tactically in the second-round runoff. Political science professor Corinne Mellul says, with the socialists out of the picture, tomorrow's vote will be important to the right and the left. CORINNE MELLUL: Considering that the left has virtually no chance - we don't even know if Hollande is going to run again or not - it's very important who the right-wing nominee or center-right nominee is going to be 'cause that candidate will probably be facing Marine Le Pen in the second round. BEARDSLEY: Alain Juppe is leading in the polls. He's a former foreign and prime minister and the current mayor of Bordeaux. He's seen as a moderate unifier. In second place is former French President Nicolas Sarkozy. After losing his re-election bid to Hollande in 2012, Sarkozy vowed he would leave politics. But now he's back. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) NICOLAS SARKOZY: (Speaking French). BEARDSLEY: In Thursday's debate, Sarkozy said only he had the authority, energy and experience to lead France. But polls show Sarkozy is very divisive. Most French people feel he had his chance while he was president for five years. And they don't want him back. Cecile Alduy, author of a book on Marine Le Pen, says the conservatives will have to choose carefully tomorrow if they want to be sure of beating the National Front candidate next May. CECILE ALDUY: I think if Alain Juppe, who is right now the frontrunner, wins the primaries, there will be a rallying around him against Marine Le Pen in the second round of the presidential election. And she will not get elected. BEARDSLEY: But if Sarkozy wins the primary, she says, it will be more difficult for people on the left to vote for him. And the result will be much more up in the air.

Bernie Sanders speaks during a rally on Capitol Hill Thursday.\n                \n                    \n                    Mark Wilson/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Sen. Bernie Sanders speaks during a rally on Capitol Hill Thursday. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. has plenty of differences with Donald Trump, but the former Democratic presidential candidate said Thursday there are areas where he could find agreement with the president-elect in the coming year. \"Mr. Trump campaigned as a populist, campaigned as somebody who is anti-establishment, and I have zero doubt that he received the support of many working class people all across the country because of some of the positions that he took,\" Sanders told reporters at a Christian Science Monitor breakfast. Despite being on opposite ends of the political spectrum in many ways, some of those populist ideas from Trump were similar to the ones Sanders made the cornerstone of his insurgent primary campaign, particularly an outspoken opposition to trade deals such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Sanders said the two might also be able to find common ground on an increase in infrastructure projects that could create more jobs. But Sanders added that now it was time to see whether Trump's slogans and campaign promises were for real, and that he and other members of Congress would now hold his feet to the fire, particularly on his pledges not to slash Social Security, Medicare or Medicaid. \"During the campaign he said a lot, and we will find out soon enough about whether what he said was sincere ... our job is to hold him accountable and we intend to do that,\" Sanders said. Sanders added that if Trump keeps his campaign promises and \"has the guts\" to stand up to corporate America and fight to stop companies from moving overseas, \"he will have an ally with me.\" Sanders was also very clear on where he disagreed with Trump, saying, \"there are places where there can be no compromise \u2014 racism, homophobia, sexism, Islamophobia.\" The Vermont senator was particularly incensed over Trump's appointment of Steve Bannon, Trump's campaign CEO and former head of Breitbart News, to be a senior strategist in the White House. Sanders said his office has already gotten hundreds of calls calling for Trump to cut ties with Bannon, who has come under scrutiny for his and Breitbart News's ties to the alt-right and the white nationalist movement. \"I would hope very much that President-elect Trump understands the fear and anxiety of [Bannon's] attitudes on race on, his attitude toward women and would try to make the American people feel more comfortable,\" Sanders said. \"And I hope that he would do it by rescinding his nomination of Mr. Bannon.\" Sanders also said he hoped Trump would apologize for some of the divisive language he helped fuel on the campaign trail. Sen. Bernie Sanders speaks at a Christian Science Monitor breakfast on Thursday morning at the St. Regis Hotel in Washington, D.C.\n                \n                    \n                    Brian Dozier for The Christian Science Monitor\n                    \n                \nhide caption Sen. Bernie Sanders speaks at a Christian Science Monitor breakfast on Thursday morning at the St. Regis Hotel in Washington, D.C. \"Let me be clear \u2014 I happen to think that Donald Trump is a very smart person, and he would not have been elected president if he were not a very smart person. I also have no doubt that he, in his way, loves this country,\" Sanders said. \"I would hope very much that given his background and given some of the, what I consider to be, terrible, terrible things that he has said on the campaign trail to minorities\" that he apologizes. Sanders remains an independent, though he caucuses with Democrats and was just named to their leadership team as the new chairman of outreach, a position he described Thursday as working to transform America through the grassroots and get more people engaged in the political process. He said that the Democratic Party had failed to do that this election, and now it was time for them to do some \"soul searching.\" \"The evidence is pretty clear,\" Sanders continued, \"that when you lose the White House in a campaign against a gentleman, who, I believe, will enter the White House as the least popular candidate in the history of this country, when you lose the Senate, when you lose the House, when you lose two-thirds of state governor's chairs, when you've lost some 900 seats of legislatures around the country in the last eight year, I think it is time for the Democratic Party to reassess what it stands for and where it wants to go.\" Sanders said that amounted to a choice for Democrats to decide whether they're standing with \"corporate America\" and Wall Street or with a declining middle class. He echoed the sentiment at a rally in Washington Thursday Those were exactly the same criticisms that Sanders lobbed at Clinton during their bitter primary fight, though he didn't directly criticize the campaign she ran or whether or not a greater emphasis on economic disparity might have helped her win over rural, white working-class voters. At Thursday's breakfast, Sanders wouldn't speculate on whether or not he might have beaten Trump, though the night before speaking to students at George Washington University he seemed to do just that. \"It doesn't matter. I don't know if I could have won. Who knows. It doesn't make much sense to me to be looking backward. Right now the country is facing enormous crises\" of income inequality and rising unemployment, Sanders said, that merit more concern. Later on Thursday, Sanders held a \"People's Rally\" on Capitol Hill in conjunction with several progressive groups. He echoed many of the themes he hit on earlier that morning. As the crowd chanted \"Bernie! Bernie!\" he told them that they were \"motivated by love unlike some who are motivated by hatred.\" Basia Dugan, 24, was in the crowd and said she approved of Bernie's future-looking message. \"I think Bernie is making a lot of big steps to kind of say it doesn't matter how we got here. We're here now. How are we going to move forward?\" said Dugan, who lives in D.C., but is originally from Pittsburgh. \"I think he's done a really good job of not making it about him.\" Taylor Eldridge, a D.C. resident agreed. \"It's so great that so many people are now fired up again, even though he's no longer in the running to become POTUS,\" Eldridge said. \"I'm glad that he's still firing up the base and expanding that base.\" NPR's Brakkton Booker contributed to this story.",

            "article_content": "The lead up to the presidential election saw GOP congressional leaders in conflict with their nominee. After winning the White House and retaining control of the Senate and House, are they united?  DAVID GREENE, HOST: Congressional Republicans come back to work in Washington today, victorious after winning the White House and retaining control of both the House and Senate. Now, before the election, some of them struggled to endorse and sometimes even to defend Donald Trump. That was especially true of House Speaker Paul Ryan, who today faces an election of his own. And let's hear about that from Susan Davis, who covers Congress for us. Sue, good morning. SUSAN DAVIS, BYLINE: Good morning, David. GREENE: So Speaker Ryan, I mean, is he going to have a hard time winning support of people in his party after, you know, his lackluster support of candidate Trump? Is that a fair way to put it? DAVIS: You know, it's funny the difference an election makes, right? GREENE: Yeah, I guess so. DAVIS: So House Republicans - it's a very different tune about Paul Ryan. The theme this week in talking to lawmakers was it's all about party unity. It's all about coming together and that today's vote is really a test vote of that party unity. The real vote for speaker, of course, is on the first day of the congressional session. Today, just House Republicans are going to elect their leadership team. GREENE: Oh, OK, so we'll get a sense for whether Ryan gets that strong support. DAVIS: Yes, and the more votes he gets from his colleagues, the show of support he's going to have. He formally announced he would run again for speaker in a letter to his colleagues in which he promised to, in his words, go big and go bold. GREENE: OK. Well, if he goes big and goes bold, he'll probably be working with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, also a Republican. They are working with what will be a Republican president on an agenda presumably. I mean, what - any sense for what that agenda will look like and how it will take shape? DAVIS: Yeah, very much so. So the big three that they're already talking about is repealing and replacing President Obama's health care law. GREENE: Which Donald Trump has said he still wants to do but maybe with some caveats now. DAVIS: And maybe keep some of the more popular parts of the law. We'll see how that plays out. They want to cut taxes, particularly on the business side of the tax code and, of course, talk of border security and if and how they're actually going to build that wall. There's also a conversation about spending and infrastructure. You know, Donald Trump campaigned on big-league spending. He wanted to build better airports and roads, and that's going to be a real pressure test of the next Congress where Republicans have been kind of resistant to new spending. GREENE: Now, there is another party. They don't control the White House or either house now, but the Democrats are still there and very determined to be in a strong opposition. They're holding leadership elections this week. I mean, is this a party that is going to try and make some huge changes after this election? DAVIS: You know, there is the first real stirring of discontent in the Democratic Party after these elections. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi is so far not challenged for her leadership position, but there is an effort to delay those elections. Members are circulating a letter to try and get them pushed back. They want to have a conversation. And there's an effort to recruit Ohio Congressman Tim Ryan to run against her because he represents the kind of district of white working-class voters that the Democratic Party lost. But so far, there's no real challenge emerged, but there are - there is some internal stirring about it. GREENE: And briefly, are we going to see anything happen in the Congress in the lame duck session as we - during the next few weeks? DAVIS: The only thing they have to do is keep the government running when the funding runs out December 9. Republicans say they are now waiting for President-elect Donald Trump to decide what he wants, and they'll defer to him on that. GREENE: OK. That is NPR congressional correspondent Susan Davis.

            "article_content": "Donald Trump's surprise victory on Tuesday came largely due to his over-performance of expectations in the Midwest. His populist, anti-trade deal message was tailor-made for this region, but polling hadn't shown him pulling ahead of rival Hillary Clinton there. But on Election Night, it was clear the surveys had missed a massive surge in some places and shifts in others of white, working-class voters in Iowa, Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania that helped Donald Trump pull off the upset. These maps show where the Trump surge happened and the places that flipped from supporting President Obama in 2012 to going for the Republican nominee and billionaire real-estate mogul just four years later. In some places, the changes were more concentrated. Just three counties flipped from Obama to Trump in the Keystone State \u2014 Erie County along the Ohio border, Northampton County in the Allentown suburbs and Luzerne County, where the Wilkes-Barre suburbs. Luzerne saw a 25-point swing from Obama to Trump. Traditionally red counties in Pennsylvania, in particular, saw a massive shift in the margins toward Trump, as well. But in Wisconsin \u2014 the state that ended up putting Trump over the top in the electoral vote early Wednesday morning \u2014 22 counties that had once voted for Obama switched to Trump. Some of those counties \u2014 such as Sawyer, Forest and Adams \u2014 have some of the highest unemployment rates in the state. Michigan had 12 counties that went from blue to red, including critical Macomb in the Detroit suburbs and the swing counties of Calhoun and Monroe. Iowa had a whopping 31 of its 99 counties that went from the Obama column to Trump's. The bellwether county of Cedar, which has picked the winner of every presidential race since 1992, again got it right. Even though Obama carried it by 4 points in 2012, Trump won it by 18 this year. You can check out the demographic trends, unemployment data, education level in these states and more in the state tables and results complied by the NPR Visuals Team. Other states, such as Minnesota and Maine, also saw significant swings from Obama to Trump. Clinton held on narrowly to win in Minnesota, though 19 counties went from the blue to the red column from four years ago. In Maine, Trump picked up 1 electoral vote for winning Maine's 2nd Congressional District. There were some swings from red to blue for Clinton. In California, Orange County voted for Republican Mitt Romney by 8 points in 2012, but Clinton carried it by 5 on Tuesday. And in Georgia, a state Democrats believe has been trending their way, Gwinnett and Cobb counties in the Atlanta suburbs both went for Clinton after having voted Republican four years ago.",

Donald Trump has proposed a very detailed tax plan \u2014 but his statements on the campaign trail don't always match what his proposal would really do. For instance, at a rally in Scranton, Pa., Trump promised to \"massively cut taxes for the middle class, the forgotten people, the forgotten men and women of this country, who built our country.\" During a town hall meeting on NBC's Today show, he said he believes in raising taxes on the wealthy. And at least half of Trump's supporters agreed with him on that, according to a pre-election survey by RAND Corp., a research group. \"Just before the election, after the last debate, 51 percent of them intending to vote for Trump supported increasing taxes on high-earning individuals,\" says Michael Pollard of RAND. But Trump's plan does the opposite, says Lily Batchelder, a law professor at New York University and visiting fellow at the Tax Policy Center. \"If you look at the most wealthy, the top 1 percent would get about half of the benefits of his tax cuts, and a millionaire, for example, would get an average tax cut of $317,000,\" she says. Lily Batchelder, a law professor at NYU and visiting fellow at the Tax Policy Center, says Donald Trump's plan would boost taxes for many families, with some of the largest increases applying to single-parent families \"because of the repeal of the head of household filing status and personal exemptions.\" Source: Tax Policy Center But a family earning between $40,000 and $50,000 a year would get a tax cut of only $560, she says, and millions of middle-class working families will see their tax bills rise under Trump's plan \u2014 especially single-parent families. \"A single parent who's earning $75,000 and has two school-age children, they would face a tax increase of over $2,400,\" Batchelder says. That's if they had no child-care deductions; the increase in taxes comes partly because the Trump plan eliminates the $4,000 exemption for each person in a household. Steve Calk, a Trump economic adviser, says the loss of the exemption is partially offset by other changes in Trump's plan. He takes issue with the Tax Policy Center's analysis and argues that there will be big tax cuts for middle-income families. Take a family earning $50,000 a year, Calk says, \"and their child-care costs are $7,000 or $8,000 a year. They're going to save 35 percent on their net tax bracket.\" Batchelder says that calculation is misleading because it focuses on tax rate reduction rather than a family's after-tax income \u2014 in other words, how much money they have in their pocket after taxes. President-elect Donald Trump's website says working- and middle-class taxpayers would see the biggest tax cuts, in percentage terms, under his plan. Source: donaldjtrump.com But Calk argues the personal-income tax cuts, as well as the Trump proposal to reduce the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 15 percent, will help taxpayers by boosting economic growth. \"The single best way to help people that are in the low-income bracket or unemployed or underemployed is, No. 1, to get them employed in real jobs with real benefits,\" Calk says. Economists disagree on whether the tax plan would be good for the economy. The Tax Policy Center says that over the first decade, the government would lose $6.2 trillion in revenue, producing huge budget deficits that could hurt the economy. One other element of the Trump plan is worth noting: It would eliminate the federal estate tax entirely. Only the wealthiest taxpayers \u2014 less than 1 percent \u2014 now pay that tax. Ending it would lead to an even greater concentration of wealth in the U.S. Editor's Note: John Ydstie spoke at length about Trump's proposed tax plan on NPR's NewsTime earlier this week.

            "article_content": "In Michigan and other Midwest states, many women say they'd love to see a female president someday, but a candidate's gender shouldn't be a reason to vote for her.  SCOTT SIMON, HOST: Michigan voted for a Republican for president for the first time in 28 years. Although low voter turnout in big Democratic strongholds like Flint and Detroit played a role, exit polling shows that rural voters turned out in record numbers to flip Michigan. Michigan Radio's Lindsey Smith explored the crucial role that women played in electing Donald Trump. LINDSEY SMITH, BYLINE: With the first female presidential candidate on the ballot this election, it was widely expected women would turn out in large numbers for Hillary Clinton. Most did, but exit polls still show 42 percent of women backed Trump. White, non-college-educated women voted for Trump 2 to 1. ANNE SAWYERS: I'd love to see a woman in the White House but the right one. And I don't believe she is the right one at all. SMITH: Anne Sawyers and her husband own a small business in Grand Ledge, a town of just 8,000 people outside of the state capital. Sawyers likes Trump's shoot-from-the-hip, tell-it-like-it-is style. SAWYERS: Like, the Clintons have - you know, people have speeches prepared for them. He speaks from his heart. SMITH: Her friend Amy Waldrop, who lives nearby, agrees, though she admits Trump's comments are unpolished at times. Waldrop says she was appalled at the pressure put on women to elect Clinton as the first female president. AMY WALDROP: And to some degree, it's insulting that they felt that we would vote for her just because she's a woman rather than use our minds. It is worse than what - you know, anything that Trump has said. SMITH: Waldrop and Sawyers weren't happy with some of Trump's controversial comments about women, but they were willing to look past them because of pocketbook issues. So as Diane Schindlbeck, though she says the comments he made on the now-infamous \"Access Hollywood\" tape were hard to hear. DIANE SCHINDLBECK: I also believe in forgiveness, and I know I have done things that I'm ashamed of. I know I have said things I wish I wouldn't have. SMITH: I met Schindlbeck at a post-election party this week at a pizza-parlor-slash-Trump-campaign-office in Muskegon. With her bright red frames, bold, short red hair and matching red fingernails, Schindlbeck stands out. She's not your reluctant Trump supporter. She opened this Trump office before it was an official campaign office, before the primaries, spending her own money. So last month, when polls started to show Trump gaining major ground in Michigan, Schindlbeck took a chance, sacrificed big. She quit her nine-to-five job to volunteer full time for Trump. SCHINDLBECK: Yes, my husband kept looking at me (laughter). I promise it's going to pay off some day, honey. I promise. SMITH: Schindlbeck is not surprised by the number of women in Michigan who voted for Trump because of her informal polling system. SCHINDLBECK: I actually have some vinyl door slabs on my car that says West Michigan for Trump. More women would drive by and give me thumbs up and a smile than the middle finger, OK? I was getting more thumbs than I was the other finger. SMITH: Schindlbeck and many others here who say gender just wasn't a factor for them. Their issues were not gender-specific. More than anything, they want to see the economy improve for working-class people. And they're confident that Donald Trump's reputation as a dealmaker will win over even more women.

            "article_content": "Donald Trump's victory in Indiana was even bigger than expected. Now, blue collar workers have high hopes that Trump can bolster manufacturing and bring back jobs from overseas, as promised.  SCOTT SIMON, HOST: Trump's victory in states like Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan was fueled in part by his success with blue-collar voters. In northern Indiana's factory towns, working-class voters now hope that President-elect Trump will deliver on those promises and bring manufacturing jobs back. NPR's David Schaper reports. DAVID SCHAPER, BYLINE: In the shadow of the hulking steel mills along the southern rim of Lake Michigan, lunchtime patrons at the Rosewood Family Restaurant in Portage, Ind., remain focused on a key issue that drove many of their votes - the economy. DAVE HANSEN: What economy? SCHAPER: Seventy-six-year-old Dave Hansen is retired from the trucking business. HANSEN: Where's the big economy around here? Where's all these steel mills working? They ain't working. We have people laid off. The economy's bad in this part of the country. SCHAPER: The steel industry here in northern Indiana and all around the country is hurting. Steel mill jobs are disappearing because of a glut on the world market and, in particular, the dumping of cheap steel by China. President-elect Trump promised during the campaign to stand up to China. DONALD JONES: Well, I just hope he lives up to what he was telling us he would do. SCHAPER: Retired steelworker Donald Jones says he did not support Trump, but he could in the future. JONES: But if Trump can accomplish that and truly impose good tariffs on imported steel, then I would vote for him. You know what I mean? SCHAPER: Others here like Trump's call to sanction U.S. companies that move factories out of the U.S. David Barry trains truck drivers. DAVID BARRY: Manufacturing's overseas, so we need to hopefully bring manufacturing back. I don't know how that's going to be feasible, but if it does a slight improvement, it'll help. SCHAPER: Barry says he voted for Trump because he spoke directly to the struggling working class. BARRY: There's a lot of Americans out of work, OK? Working-class America - like he said, we need to make our country great again. You get manufacturing, get people working, everything picks up. SCHAPER: He calls it the domino effect - something Rosewood Restaurant server Tanya Atkins knows something about well. TANYA ATKINS: If he sticks to his word, like he has promised us - that he's going to bring us more business, which will bring us more mills, which will bring us more customers, which makes my pay go up and my bills get paid. SCHAPER: About 80 miles to the east, many of those shooting pool or sitting at the bar here in the Courthouse Pub in downtown Goshen, Ind., work in the RV industry. When President Obama made this area the first place he visited after taking office in 2009, Elkhart County here had the highest unemployment rate in the country. The RV business has picked up tremendously since then. Area factories now can't fill all of their open jobs, but 54-year-old David Pinkerman says the long unemployment lines are always in the back of his mind. DAVID PINKERMAN: We have another economy collapse, the people sitting in this place right now - we're all done. PINKERMAN: Many here seem to have a hard time trusting that the recovery will last. And RV service technician Randy Leinback says one key reason for that is... RANDY LEINBACK: The price of oil. SCHAPER: Gas-guzzling RVs don't sell when fuel prices are high, so Leinback wants President-elect Trump to approve more pipeline, support fracking and... LEINBACK: Expand on offshore oil drilling and keeping the oil flowing to keep the gas prices low. SCHAPER: But outside of the Courthouse Pub is another point of view. ASHLEY FENNER: I think that Obama was on a good roll. SCHAPER: Twenty-six-year-old Ashley Fenner says too few people in Elkhart County, which Trump won by a more than two-to-one margin, give President Obama enough credit for fixing the economy here. Her friend Hope Griffith isn't optimistic, but wants Trump to keep the country moving forward. HOPE GRIFFITH: I would like to see him sound like a president, look a president, act like a president. SCHAPER: The young women also hope President-elect Trump can help the country come together after such a bitter campaign. David Schaper, NPR News, in Goshen, Ind. Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.

For 130 years, the hulking Bethlehem Steel Mill dominated the economy of eastern Pennsylvania's Northampton County, providing jobs for generations of residents. Today, it's been replaced by a Sands Casino. \"It was thousands of jobs. The entire south side of Bethlehem was built for the residents, the employees of Bethlehem Steel. Now it's nothing,\" says county resident Keith Hornik, who works at his family's construction company. To Hornik and others, there's a direct line between the closure of the steel mill in 1995 and the fact that the bellwether county swung to Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton in Tuesday's election, by a vote of 49.6 to 45.8 percent. Four years ago, Barack Obama beat Mitt Romney by nearly 5 percentage points. With its mix of office parks and cement plants, cornfields and superstores, Northampton County has a fairly diverse economy, fueled in part by an influx of commuters from the Greater Philadelphia and New York City areas. New housing developments are popping up in parts of the county. The local unemployment rate was 5.4 percent in September, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But the veneer of mild prosperity masks a lot of economic anxiety that has only grown worse over the past few years, says Mary Barket, who heads a pro-Trump women's group. The reality for many county residents is \"more bills, less pay, more struggles. They're paying more for their food but their paychecks are not increasing,\" she says. Barket, who volunteers at a help line operated by her church, says people often call in asking for help because they're having financial problems. \"I have had people calling in and the conversation is, 'I never thought we'd find ourselves in this position. But my job was cut, and I'm having a hard time finding another position,' \" she says. Democrats lost the county because they've left those voters behind, she believes. Chris Borick, who directs the Institute of Public Opinion at Muhlenberg College, says Trump won in part because of a huge turnout in the older, rural parts of Northampton County, and he says economic issues appear to have played a part in the vote. Local residents who have participated in focus groups Borick has run have pretty ambivalent views about the economy, he says. \"They don't say it's excellent. They don't say it's fantastic. Generally, they say it's good, but in essence it might not be good enough for those voters who have the impression they want something more,\" he says. Michael Hard was laid off from his job at a local paint company in 2008 because automation made his job redundant. He has since rebounded, making more money as a property and casualty insurance agent, but working much longer hours. Today, he takes a dim view of trade pacts such as the North American Free Trade Agreement and thinks the United States was too quick to embrace globalization. \"Now we're seeing sort of the results of that. We have more people taking orders and less people making things these days. And I think that's something that people are tired of. They want opportunities,\" Hard says. Hornik says he believes a change in trade pacts could help people in the middle class. \"I think fairer trade deals will bring the manufacturing back,\" he says. \"Raising the tariffs on this stuff we import. We just have to find a way to get the manufacturing back here. There's just too many double-income families. That's not how the middle class worked. You used to have the stay-at-home moms. Now it's paycheck to paycheck for a lot of families.\" Hard, who volunteered for Trump in this year's election, knows that the president-elect probably can't accomplish everything he has promised, but he wants Trump to try to push back against the forces of globalization. \"If we don't see real, measurable progress within the first 18 months, that's going to spell doom for him the next time he wants to be elected,\" Hard says.",

It was perhaps the unthinkable: President Obama meeting with his successor at the White House in the first step to carry out the peaceful transition of power in the American republic \u2014 and that successor is Donald Trump. But that's exactly what happened Thursday morning in what amounts to one of the more surreal moments in American political history. President-elect Trump, who rose to political fame by falsely questioning the birthplace of the sitting president, said he had \"great respect\" for Obama, called him a \"very good man\" and said he would seek his \"counsel\" in the future. Trump, who noted that the two had never met before, said they were slated to speak for maybe 10 to 15 minutes, but the meeting, which lasted more than an hour and a half, could have gone on even longer. Trump said they talked about \"difficulties\" around the world but also about accomplishments. \"I very much look forward to dealing with the president in the future, including counsel,\" Trump said. \"He's \u2014 he explained some of the difficulties, some of the high-flying assets, and some of the really great things that have been achieved.\" Obama described it as an \"excellent conversation\" and \"wide-ranging\" \u2014 from how to organizationally set up a White House to foreign and domestic policy. \"I believe that it is important for all of us, regardless of party and regardless of political preferences, to now come together, work together to deal with the many challenges that we face,\" Obama said, adding that he wanted Trump and his wife, Melania, the incoming first lady, to feel \"welcome\" as they make the transition. \"And most of all,\" Obama continued, \"I want to emphasize to you, Mr. President-elect, that we now are going to want to do everything we can to help you succeed, because if you succeed, then the country succeeds.\" The tone and grace of the meeting stood in stark contrast with the contentious campaign and the history between these two. President Obama openly mocked Trump at a White House Correspondents' Dinner. Less than a year ago, last December, when Trump was ascendant in the polls, this reporter wrote: \"[Obama] joked in 2011 that Trump, who was hot on the trail of Obama's birth certificate, was a conspiracy theorist waiting to reveal the fake moon landing, then roasted him for making the hard decisions \u2014 like firing Gary Busey instead of Lil' Jon or Meatloaf on Celebrity Apprentice. \"Just eight months ago, Obama joked that Trump was 'here. Still.' That got big laughs. \"But it's Trump's supporters who are laughing now.\" Trump has been a thorn in Obama's side. He rose to political fame using the birther movement to translate his pop-culture notoriety as a reality-TV star into an improbable winning presidential campaign. That birther movement questioned the president's place of birth and thereby the legitimacy of the first African-American president. The president, of course, was born in Hawaii. Trump finally later acknowledged that during this campaign but made no apology for his crusade. Trump used the issue to stir up a base of antipathy toward this president. It wasn't even so much that the largely rural, white, populist voters who eventually propelled Trump into the White House really believed the accusations and innuendo to be true. But they liked that Trump spoke to them when they felt ignored \u2014 by the professional class, the Washington establishment and the media elites \u2014 and was willing to annoy and disrupt them all. What Trump accomplished is nothing short of a populist, white working-class revolt \u2014 even as he lost the national popular vote to Democrat Hillary Clinton. Trump was able to win giant margins in white, rural counties, especially in the Industrial North and Midwest, like Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. It was enough to offset Clinton's margins in the cities and suburbs, upending decades of the fundamentals of political thought and analysis.

White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough was spotted by the White House pool taking a walk on the White House grounds with Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner. Kushner is married to Trump's daughter Ivanka. Kushner played a key role in Trump's campaign. Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus has been rumored to potentially serve as Trump's chief of staff, though he told NBC he has had \"no conversations\" about that. Kushner also appears poised to play a key role as an adviser in President Trump's inner circle; it would be remarkable, though, if he were tapped as chief of staff, given he's a member of the family. He's also the publisher of the New York Observer. Trump also met with Republican leaders on Capitol Hill this afternoon. After meeting with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Trump spoke briefly saying his \"really great\" priorities will be immigration, \"big league jobs\" and health care. As NPR's Ailsa Chang reports, when asked if he's going to ask Congress to pass a Muslim ban, he declined to answer the question and walked on.

Trump also met with House Speaker Paul Ryan in the speaker's office, saying after the meeting: \"I think we are going to absolutely spectacular things for the American people and I look forward to starting --- quite frankly we can't get started fast enough.\" Ryan praised Trump's victory as \"one of the most impressive\" ever seen and also conveyed a sense of urgency saying the two talked about \"how we are going to hit the ground running to get this country turned around and make America great again.\" The two also said they looked forward to working together on health care, immigration, lowering taxes and other issues. According to a pool report from Politico's Edward-Isaac Dovere, Trump said he had a \"great meeting\" with Ryan and then the speaker led him out onto his balcony. Ryan pointed to various sites in the city and as well as Trump's new hotel in downtown D.C. saying \"that's it right there, that's the Old Post Office Building.\" Trump called the view \"absolutely beautiful.\"",

The election of Donald Trump was a surprise to pollsters, pundits and, perhaps most of all, the Democratic Party. With Republicans in power in the White House, Senate and House of Representatives, Democrats will now have to figure out their role as the minority party. Here are four questions the Democrats will have to grapple with as they think about the future. In Hillary Clinton's concession speech, she urged a \"peaceful transfer of power\" but also spoke of respecting the Constitution. She said the Constitution enshrines the rule of law, equal rights and the freedom of worship and expression. She urged Democrats to defend those rights. In that appeal was a kind of veiled prediction of resistance if necessary, if Trump abrogates any of those rights. She was telling Democrats to not give up, and little girls, who she highlighted explicitly, to not give up. She was hinting at the kind of conflicts that might come up and how she would want her party to deal with them. It's still early, and a lot of Democrats are in a state of shock. Before the election, journalists were writing or getting ready to write circular firing squad articles about the Republicans. Now they are going to write them about Democrats instead. But the party has already identified some scapegoats, among them FBI Director James Comey, who was criticized for resurfacing Clinton's email scandal shortly before the election; former Rep. Anthony Weiner, estranged husband of Clinton aide Huma Abedin, who is embroiled in sex scandals; WikiLeaks, which released troves of Clinton emails; and Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson. Above all those names, though, is Hillary Clinton herself. She was a weak candidate with tremendous baggage and very high unfavorable ratings. She was a status quo candidate with a status quo campaign in a change election. There's a lot of talk among Democrats now about how to reach white working-class, non-college voters. Clinton underperformed with that demographic compared with Obama. It's possible that Joe Biden or Bernie Sanders might not have had the same problems. But the percentage of white working-class voters keeps shrinking as a portion of the electorate. The Democrats' coalition of voters is ascendant and growing, but they have to get them to turn out without Obama on top of the ballot. Still, they have won the popular vote in six of the past seven presidential elections. Party members are also saying this was not an election about two ideologies. It was really about values: inclusiveness, respect, diversity and tolerance. It really divided the country in deep ways. Trump talks a lot about Brexit, the nickname for Britain leaving the European Union, as an analogy for the working-class rising up against the elites and against globalization. The Brexit analogy could also be applied in a different way: That decision perfectly cleaved the British population, just like this election did here. It was young versus old, rural versus urban. This election completely divided the country on race, gender, class and education. Their main strategy will be to oppose Trump, and it's a pretty simple task when you're the minority in Congress. They want to block the majority party and the White House when they disagree with them. Republicans have been excellent at this. They created a path to get the majority back in the 2010 and 2014 midterm elections. If Nancy Pelosi decides to stay on as minority leader, she might do the same thing that Mitch McConnell and John Boehner did. One other thing Democrats are looking for is the new, younger generation of leaders. This is definitively the end of the Clinton era, and they're looking at people like Julian Castro, the secretary of Housing and Urban Development, and his brother, U.S. Rep. Joaquin Castro; also Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, Sen. Amy Klobuchar, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, Sen. Tim Kaine and Sen. Cory Booker. The Democratic bench is pretty decimated, which is why there were two old people \u2014 Sanders and Clinton \u2014 running for the nomination. No one person has emerged yet, but they're looking for new leadership.",

            "article_content": "The GOP pulled out a surprising win largely on the strength of white working class voters, but not solely. NPR explores whether this represents a new winning coalition for that party and what might have happened to the Obama coalition.  ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: Donald Trump's victory last night surprised many. So how did he do it? Joining me now to talk about that are NPR political editor Domenico Montanaro and NPR's Asma Khalid, who covers demographics for us. Good to see you both. DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Hi, Robert. ASMA KHALID, BYLINE: Hi. SIEGEL: Asma, let me start with you first. After Mitt Romney's loss in 2012, one of the big conclusions of the Republican National Committee's so-called autopsy examination of what went wrong was that it was no longer possible to win the presidency just with white voters. It seems like that turned out to be not so true this year. KHALID: That's right. And part of that is because although the minority share of the electorate is growing, the electorate is still overwhelmingly white. If we look at the exit polls from last night, about 70 percent of voters were white. And, Robert, I think what we saw sort of as a big divide - and you could say was sort of a key point for Donald Trump last night - was how white working-class voters decided to cast their ballots. So if I can give you some perspective, in the 1990s when Bill Clinton ran for president, blue-collar whites were pretty much evenly split between Republicans and Democrats. Last night, Donald Trump won this group nationally by roughly 40 points. And that was even key if we look at states like Michigan, Wisconsin and Iowa. Those three states - Barack Obama seemed to do well. He seemed to win the white working-class vote in 2008. All three of those states - the working class vote went for Donald Trump last night. SIEGEL: And it's a big group. It's a big - a big sector of the electorate. Domenico, what happened to Barack Obama's winning coalition of voters from 2008 and 2012? MONTANARO: (Laughter) Well, suffice to say, they were not fired up and ready to go, Robert. (LAUGHTER) SIEGEL: Yes, I remember that. MONTANARO: You know, Clinton didn't turn them out. Turnout was down overall, but far more for Hillary Clinton. You know, at this point, Donald Trump has gotten fewer votes than Mitt Romney did in 2012. So - and most of those voters - or many of those voters - were from this Obama coalition - young voters, African-Americans, Latinos - key places like in Milwaukee - off by 50,000 votes for Hillary Clinton. She wound up losing by 27,000 for the entire state of Wisconsin. In Michigan, Wayne County, where Detroit is - she's off by 80,000 votes compared to Barack Obama, and she lost the state by 11,000 votes overall. SIEGEL: These are places where she won, but not by a big enough margin to offset... MONTANARO: Exactly. SIEGEL: ...The losses elsewhere in the state. Asma, let's talk about women voters. How did Hillary Clinton do with that group? KHALID: Well, there was an expectation that Hillary Clinton would win women. And she did do well with women, you could say, collectively, but she did not win white women as a voting bloc. And I think what was really interesting is some folks looked at college education levels. She did seem to do well - she seemed to win white college educated women, but not by huge margins. And, in particular, you know, the college education vote, I think, surprised a lot of folks. We had seen in the polls leading up to this Election Day that she seemed to have an edge with college-educated voters. But we saw that men, in particular - white college-educated men - overwhelmingly supported Donald Trump. MONTANARO: And, look, non-college-educated men is going to be the big key here, but, you know, don't overlook non-college women. I mean, a lot of Tea Party supporters - when I went to a lot of those rallies that I covered then, you had people showing up at rallies with AstroTurf cut out over their - over their bodies and saying, you know, we're not AstroTurf. We're grassroots. So they're - they were fired up, as well. SIEGEL: Well, let me ask about another group, and that was the Latino vote. Was there a true surge of Hispanic voters before Election Day? MONTANARO: Well, yes and no. I mean, I think that you could point to specific places where we may see a fundamental realignment. Places like Arizona, Nevada, Colorado, Texas, even Georgia - you saw an increase. Texas, for example - you know, the vote was within 10 points for the first time in 20 years. Part of that is because of the Latino vote. So we may be seeing a fundamental political shift in this country where you have Latino voters moving slightly more toward Democrats and in bigger numbers as they demographically move into the electorate. But Hillary Clinton still didn't get enough of them to put her over the top overall. SIEGEL: But you're describing one part of a shift. You're saying there could be more Latino voters giving the Democrats more strength. But if there are more white working-class voters voting Republican, that might - that might counteract that. KHALID: For the short term, I think it will. I mean, they're - the white working-class vote is a shrinking part of the population. The Latino electorate is growing. But, Robert, one thing which was very interesting to me that may tie in a bit to the Latino vote is that we saw young voters not support Hillary Clinton with the same sort of vigor or enthusiasm as they came out for Barack Obama. And we know that Hispanics are overwhelmingly a young population. But last thing is I think we will get a better picture of Latino turnout when we see the census numbers. A majority of Latinos did not participate in 2012. We'll see whether or not a majority voted this year. SIEGEL: OK. That's NPR's that's Asma Khalid and Domenico Montanaro. Thanks to you both. MONTANARO: Thank you. KHALID: You're welcome. Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.  Visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.

            "article_content": "The election of Donald Trump was a surprise to pollsters, pundits and perhaps most of all, the Democratic Party. With Republicans in power in the White House, Senate and House of Representatives, Democrats will have to figure out their role as the minority party.  ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: We're going to hear now about what happens next for the Democrats with NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson. She joins us now. Welcome, Mara. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Hi, Robert. SIEGEL: Let's listen to just a bit more from Clinton's concession speech today because it may provide a hint for what's next for Democrats under a Trump administration. This is what she said. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) HILLARY CLINTON: Our constitutional democracy enshrines the peaceful transfer of power, and we don't just respect that. We cherish it. It also enshrines other things - the rule of law, the principle that we are all equal in rights and dignity, freedom of worship and expression. We respect and cherish these values, too. And we must defend them. (CHEERING, APPLAUSE) SIEGEL: Law, freedom, rights - what do you hear in that? LIASSON: I heard Clinton making a very gracious concession speech but also a kind of veiled prediction of resistance to Trump if necessary if he abrogates any of those rights. I think she was hinting at the kind of conflict that might come. SIEGEL: So for the party to move forward, how are Democrats assessing why they lost last night? LIASSON: I think it's a little early for that. They're all still in a state of shock. You know, we all were writing these circular firing-squad articles about Republicans or getting ready to write them. Now we have to write them about Democrats. But Democrats have already identified some scapegoats - James Comey, Anthony Weiner, WikiLeaks, Gary Johnson and above all, Hillary Clinton. When they're looking for a reason for their loss, she was a weak candidate with tremendous baggage, very high unfavorable ratings. She was a status quo candidate with a status quo campaign in a change election. SIEGEL: Well, what does the loss mean for the coalition of groups that the Democrats count on to win elections? LIASSON: There's a lot of talk among Democrats now about how to reach white, working-class voters, white, non-college voters. Clinton underperformed with that group compared to Obama. It's possible that Joe Biden or Bernie Sanders might not have had the same problems. But the percentage of white, working-class voters keeps shrinking as a portion of the electorate. And Democrats are also saying this was not an election about two ideologies; it was really about values, about inclusiveness and respect and diversity and tolerance. And it really divided the country in a very deep way. You know, Donald Trump talks a lot about Brexit as an analogy. He talked about the kind of working class rising up against the elites and globalization. But I think the Brexit analogy could be applied in a different way because Brexit in England perfectly cleaved the population there just like this election did here - young versus old, rural versus urban. This election completely divided the country on race, gender and education, which is the new proxy for class. So the Democrats look at their coalition of young people, minorities. They see it's growing. They have to figure out how to turn them out without Obama on the top of the ballot. But they also say they have won the popular vote in 6 of the last 7 presidential elections. So that's where they're going to start. SIEGEL: What about Democrats in Washington? What kind of strategy might they pursue in dealing with a Trump administration? LIASSON: Their strategy is opposition to Trump. It's a pretty simple task to oppose when you're the minority in Congress. They want to block the majority party and the White House when they disagree with them. Republicans have been excellent at this. They created a path to get the majority back in the midterm elections of 2010 and 2014. And Nancy Pelosi, if she decides to stay on as minority leader, might do the same thing as Mitch McConnell and John Boehner did. The other thing Democrats are looking for is the new generation of leaders. This is the end of the Clinton era, and they're looking at people like the Castro brothers, like Kirsten Gillibrand, like Amy Klobuchar, Tulsi Gabbard, Tim Kaine, Cory Booker. There's no one leader now. The Democratic bench is pretty decimated. That's why you had two fairly old people - Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton - running for the nomination. But they're looking for new leadership. SIEGEL: That's NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson. Mara, thanks. LIASSON: Thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: It's now just after 7:30 p.m. on the East Coast. Polls have just closed in two battleground states - Ohio and North Carolina - also in West Virginia. But first let's recap what we know so far. NPR political editor Domenico Montanaro and NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson are both in the studio. Domenico, I want to start with you. Where does the race stand now in terms of states and electoral college votes? DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Well, so far we've had only a few polls with results - a few states with results I should say. And so far you have three calls for Donald Trump - Indiana, Kentucky and West Virginia. You have one for Hillary Clinton in Vermont. So at this point, it's 24 to 3, but we've got a long way to go tonight. And a couple new calls in the - in some key Senate races, one in particular in Ohio - Senator Rob Portman, the Republican who had been in a tight race early on and was expected to be in a tight race at poll close time. He is called the winner by the Associated Press, which is really fascinating because everyone expects that the Ohio race at the presidential level should come down to the wire. It's within margin of error, although our map gives him a little - gives Trump a little bit of a lead there. So the race that Rob Portman has run has been quite something. CORNISH: Mara, I want you to jump in on that because this is going to be the story for the rest of the night - right? - how... MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Yes, this is... CORNISH: ...People perform down-ballot. LIASSON: Right, well, we - we're waiting to see the difference between Portman's margin and Trump's margin in Ohio. What Rob Portman did is not only did he build a really good campaign of his own. And don't forget the governor of the state, John Kasich, was not helping Donald Trump at all, so he wasn't lending Donald Trump his statewide machinery. But Rob Portman built a great campaign. But more importantly, he is a former USTR for George W. Bush, and he repudiated the Republican traditional position on trade. He came out against TPP. CORNISH: Right, a trade representative... LIASSON: Right, right. CORNISH: ...Coming out against it now. LIASSON: So you have this extraordinary spectacle of a - basically a Rust Belt state getting more downwardly mobile, more white, working-class. And you have Rob Portman, who has changed his stripes to fit with his new constituency. CORNISH: I want to stop you there. We're going to have some senators on the line, right, Robert?

            "article_content": "The 2016 campaign has left deep impressions on the identity of the Republican Party that will impact the GOP's future for years to come.  KELLY MCEVERS, HOST: If the biggest political story this year is the rise of Donald Trump, then the second-biggest is probably what's happening inside the Republican Party. We're going to dig into that with NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson. Hi, Mara. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Hi. MCEVERS: So you have of course been covering this all year. You've been talking to a lot of Republicans. What is happening in this party? LIASSON: The party is being ripped apart. It's been in an existential crisis all year. No Republican I have talked to says the party will be the same after this election regardless of whether Donald Trump wins or not. And Republicans are trying to figure out what kind of party they are. Are they an anti-immigrant, anti-free trade, white nationalist party like you see in Europe? Or are they something else? They have to decide what the Republican Party stands for. You know, the old bedrock principles of Republicanism and conservatism, free trade, small government, a strong American presence abroad - all of those things are things that Donald Trump really threw out the window this year. MCEVERS: Yeah, in what specifically has Trump and his candidacy already remade this party? LIASSON: I think win or lose, he's accelerated changes that were already happening inside the GOP. The party was already becoming relatively more white, working-class, non-college educated. The most striking thing I think is that Trump showed how poorly the Republican establishment understood their own base voters. They thought their base voters were ideological conservatives - wrong. They were voters who thought the system was rigged against them and they were getting a raw deal from immigrants or Wall Street or from the elites. And Trump spoke for them in a way that nobody else did, they thought. And of all the villains that Trump has railed against this year, the GOP establishment may be number one. MCEVERS: As you say, Trump's base has largely been white men, especially the working class and people without a college degree. Have we been ignoring this demographic? LIASSON: I think there's a case to be made that the media has been ignoring it. The GOP establishment has been taking them for granted. Even though they are a shrinking demographic, Donald Trump is winning this group by about 2 to 1, a much bigger margin than Mitt Romney did. They are the key to his victory tonight. If he can get one, he needs them to turn out in historic numbers. But the problem for Trump is as he adds in one demographic column - white, working-class voters - he subtracts in others. He's been repelling suburban women and minorities and college-educated voters, white voters, and that's made his path so difficult. MCEVERS: Between the Never Trump Republicans and Trump's biggest supporters, this debate about the future of the party has already started. How's that going to play out after tonight? LIASSON: It's going to be ugly I think. Republicans I talk to describe it with the following words - scapegoating, soul searching, circular firing squad, civil war. I mean it's really going to be intense. I think if Donald Trump wins, he remakes the party in his own image. If he loses, the first step is Republicans have to figure out, what are the lessons of 2016? They can't even - they will have to agree on whose fault it is. There's already a raging debate about that. Never Trumpers will say this was a winnable election; anybody but Trump could have beaten Hillary Clinton. And if he loses, Trump supporters will say they were betrayed by Republicans who wouldn't support their own nominee. And one - the only thing right now that I think unites Republicans is their intense animus to Hillary Clinton. MCEVERS: Right. And what will Trump do personally in either scenario, and how could that affect things for the party? LIASSON: That's a big question, and it's a really important factor. Will he do what other failed presidential nominees have done and kind of fade away, go back to selling luxury condos and golf clubs or - golf club memberships? Or will he use his big megaphone, his millions of followers to become the leader of the resistance, the resistance to Hillary Clinton, to the mainstream media, to the establishment in every form? I think if he does want to remain a player, he can, and he will complicate the post-election identity crisis of the Republican Party if he does. MCEVERS: That's NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson. Thanks as always. LIASSON: Thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "All through this election certain moments and memes online have crystallized some of the major themes of campaign 2016. NPR takes a look at some of the biggest moments and what they tell us about the current state of politics in the U.S.  AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: 2016 has been the social media election. All through this year, it seems like dozens, if not hundreds, of moments have gone viral and actually driven the news cycle. NPR's Sam Sanders is our politics and pop culture reporter. Hey there, Sam. SAM SANDERS, BYLINE: Hey, how are you? CORNISH: Now, you've actually determined the three viral moments that explain the entire election. SANDERS: Just three. CORNISH: How just three? SANDERS: I don't know. (LAUGHTER) SANDERS: Just had to cut the list down. For the first one, we got to go all the way back to the first GOP debate. It is a moment between Donald Trump and FOX News host Megyn Kelly. She asked him a pretty tough question about his record on women. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MEGYN KELLY: Your Twitter account has several disparaging comments about women's looks. You once told a contestant on \"Celebrity Apprentice\" it would be a pretty picture to see her on her knees. Does that sound to you like the temperament of a man we should elect as president? And how will you answer the charge from Hillary Clinton, who is likely to be the Democratic nominee, that you are part of the war on women? SANDERS: Trump didn't like that. Soon after that first debate, he responded like this. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DONALD TRUMP: You know, you could see there was blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her wherever. SANDERS: Yeah. So this would be the first of many offensive interactions between Trump - with women and about women. You know, he insulted Carly Fiorina's face. He mocked the weight of Alicia Machado, former Miss Universe. There was this \"Access Hollywood\" video that had him talking about groping women and some very offensive terminology. And, most recently, he called Hillary Clinton during the last debate a, quote, \"nasty woman.\" So what stood out with me was that that first moment with Megyn Kelly foreshadowed an ongoing theme with the entire election. We were going to spend a good portion of this season discussing, kind of as a society, how we treat women in the campaign trail, in the workplace and how we talk about things like a sexual assault. And what was interesting to me is that, for most of the time of this conversation, Donald Trump, a man, was the driving force. CORNISH: And that is a long list. But I know, obviously, he's not the only candidate. Can you talk about what else you saw this election cycle? SANDERS: Yes. So you know that I covered Bernie Sanders for months during the primary season. There's one moment for me that crystallizes everything that he stood for in this campaign season. It was May of this year in Portland, Ore. During the Sanders rally, a bird landed on his lectern. And the crowd, of course, went wild. It kind of perfectly crystalizes Bernie Sanders' almost-magical rise from seemingly nowhere to really be a formidable challenge to one of the most well-established politicians of the modern era. But the fact that that birdie appeared on Sanders' lectern in a city like Portland is symbolic. Portland is the whitest city in America. And it kind of spoke to Sanders' struggles - really trying to appeal to minority voters over the course of the primary season. He did well with young voters of color. But he never really tapped into enough Latino and black support to win the primary. CORNISH: Now, we haven't talked about Hillary Clinton yet. And I'm sure there must be some kind of meme-able (ph) moment (laughter) when it comes to Hillary Clinton. SANDERS: For sure. This one's kind of tied to the way that she appealed to voters of color. Last December, she was asked in Iowa whether she wanted to be president or to be Beyonce. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) HILLARY CLINTON: I want to be as good a president as Beyonce is a performer (laughter). (LAUGHTER) SANDERS: Beyonce. CORNISH: And we should say for the not-super fans out there, maybe like Hillary Clinton (laughter), it's Beyonce. SANDERS: It's Beyonce. CORNISH: OK. SANDERS: Yes, yes, yes. So there was another moment where she tried to compare herself to your abuela, which is Spanish for grandmother - internet didn't like that. There was a morning radio show she was on where she said she carries hot sauce in her bag. This was appealing to a Beyonce lyric. Folks didn't like that, either. She went on \"The Ellen Show\" and did two modern dances, the Whip and the Nae Nae - much parodied. And so throughout this whole election season, she has struggled particularly in appealing to young voters of color in spite of the high polling numbers she has with Latino and black voters. Of course, just this past weekend, Beyonce performed for Hillary Clinton. So maybe all as well. CORNISH: So Sam, what's your big takeaway from all of this? SANDERS: So I think what we're seeing is people from communities that have typically been marginalized - they are exercising more clout in politics than ever. And they expect their candidates to speak to them in a certain way, to pay a certain amount of attention to them and to get the messaging right. Groups like women and voters of color are not just driving the conversation but holding politicians on both sides to a higher standard. And, as a parallel, we've seen, in watching the rise of the anti-establishment, Donald Trump movement, a lot of working-class white voters and white men say to established politicians, hey, you don't get me, either. CORNISH: That's NPR's Sam Sanders. Sam, thanks so much. SANDERS: Thanks, Audie. Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

She was born three years before women won the right to vote. This election she cast her ballot for Hillary Clinton. A week away from turning 99 years old, Frances Kolarek has a long view of life and presidential elections. Born in 1917, three years before women won the right to vote, she cast her first presidential vote for Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Now, in 2016, she has cast her vote early for Hillary Clinton. \"I think she is undoubtedly the most qualified candidate for the presidency that we have seen in my lifetime,\" she says from her home at the retirement community where she lives, independently, outside Washington, D.C. Kolarek has bright blue eyes, an easy laugh, and a passion for words, especially The New York Times crossword. \"That's the first thing I do. I cut the crossword puzzle out, put it on a clipboard and go to work. Sometimes I've already done half of it before I have a sip of coffee,\" she says with a chuckle. She wrote a regular column for the retirement community's blog until this summer, when she decided it was time to stop. \"I was just running out of steam,\" she admits. \"I wrote the guy I was sending it to and said I thought at 99 it was time for me to retire. And he said he thought I was entitled to it, too. He agreed.\" Born during World War I, Frances Kolarek grew up in Washington, D.C. She graduated from high school at 16 and went straight to work as a secretary for MetLife Insurance Co. for $11 a week, she recalls. \"About tickled to death to get it,\" she says. It was the bleakest point of the Great Depression. She contributed that \"pittance,\" as she puts it, to her parents, to help with household expenses in those tough times. While she was working, she also started taking college classes at night at George Washington University. She chose to study chemistry, she explains, \"because it was hard, and I was having trouble with it in high school, and I wasn't gonna let it get me down.\" She was one of just two women in the program. But Kolarek always harbored a desire to write, so when she saw an ad for a secretarial job at the Washington Times-Herald, she thought, \"I'm gonna take that job. It's in a newspaper office, and we'll see what happens.\" By then, it was World War II. A lot of the reporters were gone, serving in the war, and Kolarek got a break. \"The phones were ringing at the city desk one day and I went out and answered them,\" she says. A man was calling in with a story idea: He described using his horse and buggy to get around the deprivations of wartime gas rationing. Kolarek wrote a story based on what he told her. \"And the city editor said, 'I didn't know you could write! Why didn't you tell me?' \" she recalls. A reporting career was born. She loved her job and loved the newspaper, which was a mostly male preserve. \"It was an extremely profane, raunchy atmosphere. And I thoroughly enjoyed it!\" she says. \"I just liked the way it smelled and tasted. And I learned how to fit in.\" At the Times-Herald, she met Joseph Kolarek, the man who would become her husband. She went on to work for Time magazine in New York as a reporter-researcher, and then as a stringer in Prague, when her husband was posted overseas with the Foreign Service right after the war. They'd move on to postings in Belgrade, Guinea and Bonn, and they had a daughter, Mary. \"I never stopped to think about what I couldn't do,\" Kolarek says. \"It never occurred to me. Anything I had wanted to do, I had managed to achieve.\" Kolarek's views of democracy have been shaped by the years she spent living behind the Iron Curtain, and during the repressive regime of Guinea's founding father, Ahmed Sekou Toure. \"I am a passionate American. I will not let anybody say anything against this country. It's my country, right or wrong, always, and always will be,\" she says firmly. \"I think we fail to appreciate how fortunate we are to live here in this democracy because we haven't seen how other people live, with newspapers restricted, with their ability to cast a vote restricted. Freedom isn't free! That's the bottom line.\" Now, reflecting on all she's seen in her near century of life, Kolarek says her vote for Hillary Clinton feels meaningful. \"I would like very, very much to see Hillary succeed,\" she says. \"I had misgivings about her running now. I just wondered if the country was ready to accept a woman as president. And I think I was wrong. I think we are.\"  Kolarek will absolutely be watching as the election results come in on Tuesday night. She'll stay up as late as necessary ... if she can. \"Being 99 isn't always easy,\" she says, laughing. \"I hate to admit it, but it's true!\"",

            "article_content": "The Democratic nominee spent Saturday making her closing pitch to voters in South Florida and Philadelphia, where pop star Katy Perry performed a concert at the Democratic nominee's campaign rally.  RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: Neither presidential candidate is wasting any time. They are flying from rally to rally, from state to state, making their pitch for every last vote they can muster. We're going to bring you inside the view from both campaigns - first up, NPR's Asma Khalid with the Clinton camp. ASMA KHALID, BYLINE: Clinton made a final campaign swing through Florida on the last Saturday before the election to energize early voters. She visited a heavily Latino polling site in West Miami, in fact, the very location where Senator Marco Rubio voted last week. Clinton has been spending a lot of time visiting states where people are already voting. Yesterday, she went to Broward County for one quick final Florida rally. (SOUNDBITE OF CAMPAIGN RALLY) HILLARY CLINTON: How many of you have already voted? (CHEERING) CLINTON: OK. So that means you've got time to get everybody else to get out and vote, right? (CHEERING) KHALID: Early voting data in Florida shows there's a razor-thin margin between registered Democrats and registered Republicans. But it also shows huge Latino turnout among independents. (SOUNDBITE OF CAMPAIGN RALLY) KATY PERRY: (Singing) I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter... KHALID: Last night, Clinton held a rally with Katy Perry in Philly. (SOUNDBITE OF CAMPAIGN RALLY) CLINTON: When your kids and grandkids ask you what you did in 2016, when it was all on the line, I want you to be able to say - I voted for a better, fairer, stronger America, where everybody has a chance at the American dream. (CHEERING) KHALID: Clinton's campaign manager, Robby Mook, says they're now focusing on states where most folks vote on Election Day, like Pennsylvania and New Hampshire. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ROBBY MOOK: Looking at Trump's schedule versus our schedule is pretty emblematic of how we're approaching this strategically. Trump is basically going everywhere over those last few days and just cramming in every single state. KHALID: But the campaign is also putting a lot of resources into a state that's not usually considered a battleground, Michigan. In the next two days, Hillary Clinton, Bill Clinton and President Obama will all visit Michigan. Mook insists they feel confident. But he also says... (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MOOK: I think we have seen, you know, tightening in the Midwest generally this cycle. And we're taking that seriously. KHALID: Seriously because President Obama won Michigan twice by double digits. But the state is home to a large white, working-class population. And Donald Trump has been trying to court those voters. Asma Khalid, NPR News, traveling with the Clinton campaign. Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

When it comes to Hillary Clinton's historic run for the presidency, if she's ultimately able to shatter that highest, hardest glass ceiling it will be because a combination of good luck and better planning helped her overcome challenges, many of her own making. Donald Trump's name is on the ballot, but Clinton's biggest opponent may well have been herself \u2014 as she was dogged by emails, questions over the Clinton Foundation and paid speeches. Those controversies have kept the presidential contest between Clinton and Republican nominee Trump close at the end. But Hillary Clinton will reach Election Day with the real prospect of becoming the first female president in U.S. history. She's been a candidate for 19 months. Clinton's official campaign launch was preceded by months of will-she-or-won't-she chatter, but there was lots of work behind the scenes and a \"Ready For Hillary\" superPAC working out in the open to prepare for Clinton to get in. But who would she face? In April 2015, when Hillary Clinton officially entered the race for president, she was looking over her left shoulder. It was apparent in her very first remarks, at a community college in Iowa. \"I think it's fair to say that, as you look across the country, the deck is still stacked in favor of those who are already at the top,\" said Clinton. \"And there's something wrong with that.\" Clinton's team had an eye on Vice President Joe Biden, with his everyman appeal and ability to speak the language of white, working-class voters. But ultimately Biden, whose son died of brain cancer in the spring of 2015, opted not to get into the race. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren resisted progressive recruitment efforts and didn't get into the race either. In the end, Clinton only faced one primary opponent who truly threatened her chance at the nomination: Bernie Sanders. He did far better than likely even he imagined was possible, going from oddity to rock star, with legions of adoring supporters. Sanders' movement grew over the summer of 2015 with an active online community boosting his name recognition. The crowds at his speeches and rallies kept growing to the point that he was filling sports arenas. As one Democratic activist in Iowa put it to team Clinton, \"Objects in mirror may be closer than they appear.\" And those large crowds gave Sanders' campaign more media attention and more credibility. \"You know, sometimes our campaign has been referred to as a fringe campaign. Well, if this is fringe, I would like to see mainstream,\" Sanders said to a packed auditorium at Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa, in June 2015. Clinton barely won the Iowa caucuses and Sanders then trounced her in New Hampshire. That juiced his fundraising, allowing him to run television ads and compete throughout the primary season. But Sanders' weaknesses became apparent in the South Carolina primary. His core message of income inequality and the influence of money in politics didn't resonate with many African-American voters, who felt the racial inequality they experience wasn't addressed with a focus simply on economics. That showed as the primaries moved to southern states where black voters sometimes favored Clinton by 80-point margins, according to exit polls. Sanders also famously let Clinton off the hook on her emails and didn't go after her on making paid speeches to big Wall Street banks, particularly Goldman Sachs, until late in the primary fight. Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton take part in the first Democratic presidential debate on Oct. 13, 2015 in Las Vegas, Nev.\n                \n                    \n                    Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton take part in the first Democratic presidential debate on Oct. 13, 2015 in Las Vegas, Nev. Looking toward the general election and the growing Republican field in early 2015, Donald Trump wasn't even on the radar. Few believed he would run and even fewer believed he could mount a serious candidacy. He had toyed with a presidential campaign many times before without jumping in. There was little reason to believe this time would be different. On the night of the first Republican presidential debate, Clinton's team welcomed reporters into its Brooklyn headquarters as its rapid response team crafted tweets and senior aides offered spin during commercial breaks. \"I think they're digging the hole deeper,\" Mook said to a small gaggle of reporters on the Clinton beat. But his attention quickly turned back to the TV. \"Don't get between me and Donald,\" Mook said. Their plan was to tie all the other Republicans to Trump's extreme statements, because they hardly imagined Trump would ultimately become the nominee. For Clinton, there was a generational concern. In 2008, Barack Obama represented hope and change and his relative youth was part of the appeal. In a 2016 general election, Sens. Ted Cruz or Marco Rubio would be able draw the same contrast, painting the baby boomer Clinton as a relic of the past. It was clear that was the general election challenge Clinton and her team were anticipating when she gave the big speech at her official campaign kickoff event on Roosevelt Island in New York. \"Now there may some new voices in the presidential Republican choir, but they're all singing the same old song,\" Clinton told a crowd estimated at 5,000. \"A song called, 'Yesterday.' You know the one. All our troubles look as though they're here to stay. And we need a place to hide away. They believe in yesterday. And you're lucky I didn't try singing that, I'll tell you.\" According to hacked emails released by WikiLeaks, behind the scenes, senior advisers were especially concerned about Rubio, the Florida senator. \"I'm beginning to worry more about Rubio than the others,\" Joel Benenson, the campaign's pollster and chief strategist wrote in February 2015. \"He has stronger right wing cred than Jeb and he's finding a way to the middle enough for now and he will be the most exciting choice to Republicans. Could pose a real threat with Latinos etc.\" But in the end, Trump outlasted the entire Republican field, leaving Clinton to face an opponent with well-known shortcomings and an opposition research file bigger than Trump Tower. Hillary Clinton won the opponent lottery. Not just in the primary, when Warren and Biden stayed out, but in the general election as well. There were certainly risks in facing Trump: his ability to dominate news coverage, the difficulty in pinning him down on policy. Trump's taxes, business dealings, treatment of women and tendency to say and tweet things that hurt him with voters were a constant throughout the general election campaign. But many Republicans and even some Democrats believe, with a more disciplined opponent, Clinton would easily have been facing defeat on Election Day. For the first time in at least 100 years, a sitting U.S. president has campaigned vigorously for his chosen successor. In the closing weeks of the campaign, President Barack Obama has been a regular fixture on the campaign trail for Hillary Clinton, pitching her to voters more effectively than she could pitch herself. Hillary and Bill Clinton attend the 37th Harkin Steak Fry on Sept. 14, 2014, in Indianola, Iowa.\n                \n                    \n                    Steve Pope/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Hillary and Bill Clinton attend the 37th Harkin Steak Fry on Sept. 14, 2014, in Indianola, Iowa. With an approval rating solidly above 50 percent and his natural ease on the stump, Obama essentially doubled Clinton's firepower in swing states. But he wasn't the only one. First Lady Michelle Obama, Vice President Joe Biden, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and even Bernie Sanders campaigned hard for Clinton and her running mate, Tim Kaine. Clinton won Sanders over by agreeing to modify her debt-free public college proposal to more closely track with Sanders' free college plan. He started slowly, but by the end of the race Sanders was traversing the country trying to convince his young supporters to go to the polls and not vote for a third-party candidate or Trump. The ally Clinton always had making the case on her behalf was her husband, former President Bill Clinton. By contrast, Trump's surrogate operation was thin. There were no former presidents or even former Republican presidential nominees, save Bob Dole, who appeared at the Republican National Convention. Mitt Romney actively opposed Trump and relatives said both former presidents Bush would likely vote for Clinton. From before Hillary Clinton even entered the race for president, her campaign faced headwinds of her own making. There was the private email server she used for official business while secretary of state and there were the lucrative speaking engagements during the time after she left the State Department and before her campaign officially began. Hillary Clinton speaks to the media after keynoting a Women's Empowerment Event at the United Nations March 10, 2015 in New York City, just days after it was revealed she used a private email server while secretary of state.\n                \n                    \n                    Yana Paskova/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Hillary Clinton speaks to the media after keynoting a Women's Empowerment Event at the United Nations March 10, 2015 in New York City, just days after it was revealed she used a private email server while secretary of state. When the news of Clinton's server broke, top officials in the campaign were seemingly blindsided. In hacked emails released by WikiLeaks, campaign chairman-in-waiting John Podesta emailed campaign manager-in-waiting Robby Mook asking if he knew the extent of the email issue in advance. \"Nope. We brought up the existence of emails in research this summer but were told that everything was taken care of,\" Mook wrote at the time. Clinton's campaign has refused to verify the authenticity of emails released by WikiLeaks and has also avoided commenting on any of the content. Clinton's campaign says the release of emails hacked from Podesta's personal Gmail account is part of a Russian effort to interfere with the U.S. election. In one chain, Podesta and Neera Tanden, a longtime Clinton ally, complain about the email story coming out so late in the game. \"Why didn't they get this stuff out like 18 months ago? So crazy,\" she asked. In a later email, Tanden answered her own question: \"They wanted to get away with it.\" Bernie Sanders gave Clinton a gift when he took the email server off the table as an issue in the Democratic primary during the first debate. \"Let me say something that may not be great politics, but I think the secretary is right. And that is that the American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn emails,\" said Sanders. Clinton jumped in, \"Thank you, thank you,\" she said. \"Me, too!\" Right after that came the 11-hour hearing of the House Select Committee on Benghazi. Clinton maintained a calm, somber demeanor throughout and left with House Republicans revealing no new bombshells. Hillary Clinton testifies before the House Select Committee on Benghazi on Oct. 22, 2015.\n                \n                    \n                    Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Hillary Clinton testifies before the House Select Committee on Benghazi on Oct. 22, 2015. That October was one of the best months of her campaign. But Clinton's email troubles were far from over. Just as she was launching into the general election, only hours before Clinton was to campaign with President Obama for the first time, FBI Director James Comey held a press conference. On the face of it, his announcement was good news. The FBI had been investigating whether Clinton's use of a private email server violated the law, whether she and her aides had improperly handled classified material. He said no reasonable prosecutor would pursue the case and he was recommending against charging Clinton or her aides with a crime. \"Although we did not find clear evidence that Secretary Clinton or her colleagues intended to violate laws governing the handling of classified information, there is evidence that they were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information,\" Comey said. His statement raised more questions than it answered and brought the email saga back into focus for voters. At the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, delegates began chanting \"lock her up!\" That chant became a regular feature of Trump rallies. Ten days before Election Day, Comey brought the email issue back into the spotlight, announcing emails had been found in the course of another investigation focused on former congressman Anthony Weiner, the estranged husband of Clinton's closest aide, Huma Abedin. This meant the cloud of Clinton's email server would hang over her campaign from beginning to end, and likely well beyond if she wins. Another lingering problem for Clinton's campaign came from the speeches she gave behind closed doors to Goldman Sachs and other Wall Street banks. Clinton made millions of dollars on the speaking circuit and the implication was that she was saying something behind closed doors with corporate executives that she wasn't telling voters. By the end of the primary, Sanders regularly called on her to release the transcripts. And there were transcripts, compiled by the speaker's bureau that booked Clinton's appearances. Clinton's campaign never released the transcripts. But a policy adviser did review them, sending around an email to senior staff highlighting the most potentially politically problematic excerpts. We know this, because of the hacked emails released by WikiLeaks. In addition to posting the speech excerpts, WikiLeaks also released the full text of all three of Clinton's Goldman Sachs speeches. It turns out they weren't speeches at all, but rather extended on-stage question and answer sessions. Had the transcripts leaked out during the primary, they might have been more damaging. But coming out in October, they barely registered. Hillary Clinton loves plans. Or at least she loves to talk about them. \"Maybe it is a bit of a woman's thing, because we make lists,\" Clinton began saying at rallies in the final weeks of her campaign. \"We do, we make lists, and we try to write down what we're supposed to do and then cross them off as we go on in the day or the week. So I want you to think about our plans as our list. Our list for our country.\" Clinton is a wonk at heart. Digging into the policy weeds is where she is most comfortable. She is far less comfortable with sweeping themes and inspiring speeches. So, her campaign made a plan to just let Hillary do Hillary. They kept her events small and held numerous town hall-style events and roundtable conversations. Clinton did a lot of listening and the campaign released plans and policy papers on everything from autism to defeating ISIS. The strategy was to be boring. And with that as a goal, Clinton's campaign was a success. Though there were certainly times when this baffled those watching from the outside. And while Clinton was making relatively small promises to small audiences, her campaign was building an infrastructure to reach voters where they were and bring them to the polls. The campaign started early with the slow, hard grind of person-to-person contact known in campaign lingo as organizing. The campaign was building communities, groups of people brought together by a common goal of electing Clinton, but motivated and inspired as much by their fellow volunteers as by the candidate. By the end, the campaign had half a million volunteers working to get her elected. Organizing isn't flashy. Neither were Clinton's plans and speeches. But rather than fighting against her weaknesses as a campaigner, the campaign played to her strengths. Just as the first general election debate was ending, Hillary Clinton said something that set Donald Trump off. \"This is a man who has called women pigs, slobs and dogs,\" Clinton said, echoing an ad called \"Mirrors\" that her campaign had been running in swing states and on national cable leading up to the debate. Trump hit back, making it clear he had seen the ad and didn't much like it. \"Hundreds of millions of dollars on negative ads on me, many of which are absolutely untrue,\" Trump said. \"They're untrue, and they're misrepresentations. And I will tell you this, Lester, it's not nice and I don't, I don't deserve that. But it's certainly not a nice thing that she's done. \" In that same exchange, Clinton mentioned the former Miss Universe Alicia Machado, who Trump had allegedly called \"Miss Piggy\" and \"Miss Housekeeping,\" mocking her for her Latino heritage and for gaining weight. Hillary Clinton leaves the stage after the first presidential debate at Hofstra University in Hempstead, N.Y., on Sept. 26, 2016.\n                \n                    \n                    Timothy A. Clary /AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Hillary Clinton leaves the stage after the first presidential debate at Hofstra University in Hempstead, N.Y., on Sept. 26, 2016. The case of Alicia Machado is a perfect example of the Clinton campaign's meticulous planning. Before the first debate, the campaign had already sat down with her, shooting a video where she talked about Trump mocking her weight and her struggles with eating disorders. This was edited together with archival footage of Trump bringing reporters to the gym to watch her work out. Within an hour of the debate, the campaign had released its video featuring Machado and the next day she was on a conference call with reporters. The morning after the debate in a phone interview with Fox and Friends, unprompted by the anchors, Trump started talking about Machado. He defended himself by saying she really had gained weight. Clinton had snagged him. \"Not only that \u2014 her attitude. And we had a real problem with her,\" Trump added. The whole week following the first debate was consumed by Trump and his surrogates arguing it wasn't OK for Machado to gain weight while Miss Universe. He couldn't get much further off message. This all culminated with Trump going on a pre-dawn tweet storm attacking Machado and encouraging followers to \"check out sex tape.\" Clinton made a strategic choice once she knew Trump would be her opponent. She wouldn't run against him like any other Republican. She would portray him as an outlier, an existential threat and build a case that he was \"temperamentally unfit\" to be president of the United States. This made it more a race about values, personality and temperament than policy. \"Imagine him plunging us into a war because somebody got under his very thin skin,\" Clinton said in a national security speech at Kent State University in Ohio. With carefully laid traps like the attack involving Machado or from the parents of a Muslim U.S. Army captain killed in Iraq, the Clinton campaign was able to get Trump to help make their point, one tweet or TV interview at a time. If Hillary Clinton convinces enough Americans Donald Trump is simply unacceptable for the presidency, she will become America's first female president. But she would also face incredible challenges, including repairing her own reputation, battered by two years of campaigning and the email scandal that may never fully go away.

            "article_content": "Two college Republicans at the Ohio State University explain why they're supporting Donald Trump, and consider how his candidacy will affect the future of their party.  AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: Ohio is considered a must-win state for Donald Trump. That's why our colleague Robert Siegel is there this week talking with Republicans. He's brought us the voices of working-class voters inspired by Trump's campaign and establishment Republicans who are turned off by it. Now Robert checks in with some young Republicans. ROBERT SIEGEL, BYLINE: If you're 20 years old, the country went to war when you were 5, and the economy tanked when you were 12. You've been aware of two presidents - George W. Bush and Barack Obama. You've grown up in a time when college costs were going up and household incomes weren't. Where does that experience leave young Republicans? We went to the Ohio State University in Columbus to find out. NICK FRANKOWSKI: All right, y'all - Pledge of Allegiance very informally, but... UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America... SIEGEL: These are the College Republicans at their weekly meeting last night in the student union. UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE: ...Under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. SIEGEL: Someone forgot to bring a flag, so they pledged to a Google image of an American flag projected onto a screen. This was a very sparsely attended meeting - just nine students - because it was up against Game 7 of the World Series. FRANKOWSKI: So another very quick, informal meeting because I know - I can see some Indians shirts, so you guys are very anxious to go watch the game. SIEGEL: Nick Frankowski, a member of the group's board, ran the meeting. FRANKOWSKI: Yeah, so six days until the election. It's a close one. You guys have been watching the polls and stuff. Especially from last Friday, it's really, really tightening up. So it's... UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Don't trust the polls. FRANKOWSKI: OK. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Go out and vote. FRANKOWSKI: Well, yes. I wasn't saying don't vote. But no - definitely it's a lot tighter than it was even a week ago. And so it's anybody's race. SIEGEL: Donald Trump's candidacy was not universally popular with the College Republicans. They never formally endorsed him. But a group called Students for Trump sprang up. I sat down with Nick Frankowski and with Amanda Tidwell, who's active in the Trump group. He is a sophomore political science-economics double major from Cincinnati. She's a junior economics major from Dayton. Both come from professional households. Both describe themselves as conservative, and both support the Republican nominee - Nick with some reservations, Amanda with unreserved enthusiasm. I asked them if Trump strikes them as truly conservative. AMANDA TIDWELL: I don't really like to talk about labels and label people conservative or Democrat. Is he crass - absolutely. Does he say things off the handle - absolutely. But that is - you know, our country is in such turmoil right now that we don't have time for political correctness. SIEGEL: Well, how do you feel about Donald Trump's conservatism? FRANKOWSKI: I will openly admit I have a lot of policy differences with him personally. But you know, politics is a game of alternatives, and you get a known quantity in Hillary Clinton and a lesser-known quantity in Donald Trump. And I think, you know, he is the Republican nominee. And I think he is the best possible standard bearer we've got right now. SIEGEL: When Donald Trump says make America great again, it resonates with some older voters who remember better times. But these college students' memories barely reach back to the 20th century. What does Donald Trump's slogan mean to them? TIDWELL: First and foremost, I think he wants America to be respected as a world power. Right now we are not respected at all. You know, when Obama said that, you know, when Syria uses chemical weapons against their people, that is the red line; and when they cross it, we will do X, Y, Z. We didn't do a damn thing. Pardon my language. But we know that we're not No. 1 in the world, and we know that we're not the best. And we want to be the best. And the fact that Trump wants that, too, is just phenomenal. FRANKOWSKI: For Nick Frankowski, Trump's slogan evokes a time after 9/11. That was one of his earliest memories, he says. FRANKOWSKI: I remember when it happened. They shut down my preschool, and my mom came and picked me up. She had to pull over to the side of the road because she was crying. And then after that, I remember at least for a little while, everyone felt good about being American and proud about being American. We knew who we were. SIEGEL: We were for freedom and democracy, as he recalls. Now he says the country is in an identity crisis. I asked Nick about what it's like being a Republican on this college campus. They are a distinct minority. And he claims they're a minority that is sometimes disrespected. He described one incident last spring. FRANKOWSKI: Someone on the oval in the middle of our campus wrote Trump 2016, and a huge protest came just because of this chalk. And we were like, well, he's one of our candidates. Like, we think people are allowed to like him, you know? This is a college campus. And we got a lot of, F your beliefs; you're not allowed to say that here; that's hate speech. It was just amazing seeing the anger and hostility that that produced. SIEGEL: More recently, the Trump campaign was stung by the scandalous \"Access Hollywood\" video. Amanda Tidwell's reaction... TIDWELL: At first I was like, oh, my goodness (laughter), like, this guy - he has a language on him, you know? I was taken aback, but I wasn't one of those people that was like, oh, I'm pulling my support for Trump. SIEGEL: But you accept his explanation that actually he was describing things that he has not done. TIDWELL: I don't think he - he said he didn't, so I - why wouldn't I believe him? And he apologized for saying those things, so I absolutely, a hundred percent, you know - I'm Christian. I believe in grace. And so I forgave him. SIEGEL: Nick? FRANKOWSKI: I do think character is an important part for a president. Even looking back on presidents that I am not particularly fond of, even our current president, President Obama, regardless of our policy differences, I have no doubt that he's a good man, you know? I do have serious questions about whether Hillary Clinton is a good person. I do have serious questions sometimes about whether Donald Trump is a good person. It's very frustrating to see the two major candidates display very questionable behavior to say the least. SIEGEL: Ohio State University undergraduates Nick Frankowski of the College Republicans and Amanda Tidwell of Students for Trump. The next event for the College Republicans, by the way, is a tailgate party Saturday with Ohio Senator Rob Portman. It's before the Ohio State-Nebraska game. Nick Frankowski is un-ambivalently positive about Portman, and Buckeyes football is a cause that cuts across all lines here in Columbus.

            "article_content": "NPR's Robert Siegel travels to Springfield, Ohio, which has seen the loss of many blue collar jobs in recent decades, and joins volunteer Laura Rosenberger as she canvasses a neighborhood in search of Trump supporters. Rosenberger says she doesn't always vote Republican and hasn't voted at all the past couple of years, but says Donald Trump has made her an enthusiastic Republican voter this year.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: Our co-host Robert Siegel is in the swing state of Ohio this week. No Republican president has ever been elected without winning that state. Some traditional Republicans - the state's governor, John Kasich, for one - have resisted Donald Trump's novel take on Republican politics this year. But as Robert is hearing among some Ohio voters, the enthusiasm for Trump is intense. ROBERT SIEGEL, BYLINE: There's much talk this year about angry voters, but the mood at Clark County Republican headquarters in a storefront is Springfield, Ohio, strip mall is anything but angry. Yesterday the volunteers, many of them seniors, were cheerfully preparing yard signs that say Trump and Pence, stretching the plastic signs over the wire frames. They didn't have the ones here that say Hillary for prison, but I'm told that in Ohio, those go the fastest. Donald Trump's detractors may fault him for political incorrectness, but in that department, he has got nothing on his most fervent supporters. LAURA ROSENBERGER: You got the Hillary toilet paper - no way. (LAUGHTER) UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: (Inaudible). ROSENBERGER: Yes. (LAUGHTER) ROSENBERGER: You know what I did with my Obama toilet paper? SIEGEL: That's Trump campaign volunteer Laura Rosenberger. She resents and defies a stereotype of college-educated women who were turned off by Donald Trump. She has a graduate degree. She used to teach, and she is more pro-Trump than she is pro-Republican. ROSENBERGER: And I actually haven't voted for two years because I'm so upset at the political process. So I'm not a strict true Republican voter, so to speak, like many other people who may be here today. SIEGEL: Is it fair to say that Donald Trump has made you an enthusiastic Republican voter this year? ROSENBERGER: Absolutely. SIEGEL: Next election, she says, it'll depend on who's running. But this election, she's all in. Yesterday afternoon, she was knocking on doors of potential Trump voters, often people with connections to the party as tenuous as hers. They live in a small, working-class neighborhood behind the strip mall. (SOUNDBITE OF KNOCKING) SIEGEL: At this house, the man who comes to the door answers to the name Sir Norman Gray and describes himself as a disabled, retired veteran. In Ohio, there is a great deal of early voting. ROSENBERGER: Did you vote for Trump or Clinton? NORMAN GRAY: Yeah. ROSENBERGER: Which one? GRAY: Trump. ROSENBERGER: Trump - very good. Would you like a yard sign or a bumper sticker for Mr. Trump? GRAY: Sure. I'll live dangerous. ROSENBERGER: All right. SIEGEL: Mr. Gray, or as he prefers, Sir Norman, has a sense of humor. ROSENBERGER: Are you the only registered voter in this house? GRAY: Yeah. They wouldn't let me register my companion dog, so... ROSENBERGER: Oh, too bad. GRAY: Yeah. ROSENBERGER: We could've gotten him to vote, too, for Trump. GRAY: (Laughter). SIEGEL: These are small, one-story homes, many in disrepair, typically a satellite dish on the roof, the front lawn often enclosed in a chain link fence. (SOUNDBITE OF KNOCKING) SHIRLEY MALLICK: I hear you. ROSENBERGER: Hi. MALLICK: Hi. MALLICK: Retiree Shirley Mallick's House appears to be in good shape, and she keeps a well-tended garden in the front. ROSENBERGER: And how did you vote - early vote or absentee? MALLICK: We voted absentee. ROSENBERGER: OK. If you don't mind - the presidential? MALLICK: Trump all the way. SIEGEL: Shirley Mallick used to work as a certified nursing assistant and also as a bartender. MALLICK: I'm going to be 69 in January. I have never voted, but I couldn't restrain myself this year. SIEGEL: What was it about Donald Trump that inspired her so? MALLICK: He's not a politician, plain and simple. SIEGEL: She reasons that means no dirty money coming into his campaign. Shirley Mallick also says that her bartending experience makes her tolerant of Donald Trump's offensive language captured on videotape. MALLICK: You know what? Any American man that would honestly say they never talk that way - shame, shame, shame on them. SIEGEL: After an hour of canvassing, Laura Rosenberger's tally was five Trump voters and two Clinton voters. There were a few who wouldn't say or were undecided and still more who weren't home. What does it look like to you when we walk through this neighborhood? ROSENBERGER: It looks like economic devastation. It really does. This is the result of the Clinton policies. ROSENBERGER: Specifically NAFTA. In fact, manufacturing here was on the decline long before that. But to her, the North American Free Trade Agreement is the culprit. ROSENBERGER: People here are either out of work, or they're working service sector jobs if they're lucky, you know, like at Wal-Mart or wherever up here. You can get a job up here, but it's - what? - going to pay you minimum wage. SIEGEL: Springfield, Ohio, used to be home to a big publishing company and a steel wool manufacturer. There were great jobs to be had at the International Harvester plant. It's now called Navistar. And there were plenty of those jobs. At the local Republican headquarters, I met Paul Weaver. He's 78 and says he worked at Navistar for almost 35 years painting cars. He was a longtime union member who says he used to vote Democratic. Now he's a Republican volunteer. It's his first campaign, and he says Donald Trump has changed the Republican Party by speaking to people like him. PAUL WEAVER: I watched our company lose thousands of jobs before my employment ended. What he says right now about our manufacturing - I mean I can't even tell you how many people worked at one time at Navistar. It's down to around a thousand people right now. And these are good people. I back somebody like Donald Trump who cares about America. How do you know that? Well, how many years have we been in the direction we're going. We're in worse shape than we've ever been in my entire lifetime. SIEGEL: One question for the Republican Party is whether win or lose in the presidential race this year it can embrace policies that continue to attract voters like Paul Weaver, Shirley Mallick and Laura Rosenberger. Tomorrow I'll ask some Republican Party officials and office holders what they think. Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "Many Republicans now think that Missouri Democratic Senate candidate, Secretary of State Jason Kander, will prevail over Republican Sen. Roy Blunt.\n                \n                    \n                    Reed Hoffmann/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Many Republicans now think that Missouri Democratic Senate candidate, Secretary of State Jason Kander, will prevail over Republican Sen. Roy Blunt. Two weeks from Election Day, it looks more likely than ever that Democrats will win control of the Senate. States that many thought would be the crux of their battle ground map, like Ohio and Florida, have moved down or completely off the list. But Democrats have successfully expanded the map enough so that they have multiple paths to the five seats they need for an outright majority \u2014 or four if Hillary Clinton wins the presidency, which also looks increasingly likely. Republicans, however, need a near-perfect night to keep their majority, and that looks harder and harder each day. Both Illinois and Wisconsin are probably already in the Democrats' column. Early voting numbers also portend well for Democratic chances in North Carolina and Nevada, the only GOP offensive opportunity this year. Indiana and Missouri weren't expected to be top-tier races at all just a year ago, yet they're AMONG the most competitive in the country. The sliver of good news for Republicans is that many of the races remain toss-ups with two weeks to go. Pennsylvania and New Hampshire are still coin-flips, and both GOP incumbents are outperforming Donald Trump. And the candidates and outside groups are already trying to use the \"check and balance\" argument \u2014 that they would be an essential check on a Clinton administration. Still, the trajectory for the Republican Presidential nominee isn't good, and that could further weigh down the Senate candidates as well \u2014 particularly if typically reliable GOP voters just decide to stay home. Democrats also have a massive organization advantage. Clinton's campaign has already dwarfed Trump's in staffers and offices across the country. And now that she's opened up a consistent lead, Clinton, President Obama and Michelle Obama and other top Democratic surrogates have trained their sights on down-ballot races. Republicans don't have that advantage of help from the top of the ticket \u2014 but then again, they surely wouldn't want their candidates on stage with Trump either. We last ranked these contests last month, but here's where we see these races 14 days out. We'll revisit this list again next Tuesday, with one week to go until Election Day: 1. Illinois (R-Mark Kirk) Previous rank: 1 Kirk has won tough races before thanks to ticket-splitting, and he's tried to separate himself from Trump for a long time. But there's no indication that the winds will go his way this time in deep blue Illinois. Illinois Democratic Rep. Tammy Duckworth looks nearly like a sure thing to win. 2. Wisconsin (R-Ron Johnson) Previous rank: 2 Polling has shown this rematch between the GOP incumbent and former Democratic Sen. Russ Feingold has tightened, and Johnson has been running a good campaign with strong positive ads. But national Republicans ultimately don't think it will break their way. Feingold would be the first senator since 1934 to win a re-match with the candidate that defeated him six years earlier 3. Indiana (Open, R-Dan Coats is retiring) Previous rank: 3 Democrats are clinging to this ONE for dear life, and in reality these next three rankings could probably go in any order. When former Democratic Sen. Evan Bayh surprised everyone by announcing in July he was jumping into the Senate races, Republicans gained a new headache they didn't need. With his decades-long family ties to the state and over $9 million in his dormant campaign account, it looked like he would stride easily back into the Senate. But what's followed is a less-than-stellar campaign, with the former senator and governor continually dogged about his lobbyist ties and the scant time he's spent in Indiana since retiring six years ago. New stories have poked at meetings he held as a senator when looking for a post-Congress job. GOP Rep. Todd Young and heavy spending from Republicans have made this a neck-and-neck contest, and forcing Democrats to spend to bail out Bayh is a minor victory in itself. Bayh still has the narrowest of edges in polls, but the race isn't trending in his way as the clock nears zero. 4. Pennsylvania (R-Pat Toomey) Previous rank: 4 Toomey is the lone GOP candidate in a competitive Senate race who is still waffling on Trump, and that indecision could be his undoing. He was even mocked for it on ABC's Jimmy Kimmel Live, and the headlines out of his debate Monday night with Democratic nominee Katie McGinty were that he still WOULDN'T take a position. By not doing so, he risks not only turning off the white, working class base of Trump voters in the Keystone State but also alienating independent voters. McGinty has run far from a perfect campaign and has plenty of flaws as a candidate, but Toomey can only outperform Trump BY so much in this state, especially in the crucial Philadelphia suburbs. Overall, it's not looking good for him. 5. New Hampshire (R-Kelly Ayotte) Previous rank: 6 A moment the incumbent GOP senator surely wishes she had back was when she said in a debate with Democratic Gov. Maggie Hassan that Trump was \"absolutely\" a good role model. She apologized and walked the comment back later, and after the tapes of Trump's hot-mike moment came out said she was no longer supporting him and would instead write-in his running mate, Mike Pence. Some polls have shown Ayotte with a widening lead, but both parties admit this one is down to the wire. But with Democrats' ground game advantage and the money they'll pour into the Granite State in the final weeks to dwarf GOP spending, Republicans are right to be very worried. 6. Missouri (R-Roy Blunt) Previous rank: 9 Perhaps no race has given Republicans more unnecessary heartburn than this one in the Show Me State, and some GOP strategists even think it's already lost. They've admitted from the outset that Secretary of State Jason Kander is one of the Democrats' best recruits, but Blunt didn't take this race seriously from the outset. Democrats have effectively been able to paint him as a Washington insider \u2014 this year's scarlet letter. The state has even tightened on the presidential level, but private polling has Blunt running behind Trump in the state \u2014 the opposite of pretty much every other competitive state. 7. North Carolina (R-Richard Burr) Previous rank: 7 Like Blunt, Burr didn't begin his race in earnest until too late. Republicans have had to spend millions in an effort to rescue him, and even that might not work. This is one of the top presidential battlegrounds and also has one of the top governor's races in the country. Burr may be slightly outperforming his teammates, and Republicans say some of their hits on Democratic nominee Deborah Ross on her time as executive director for the state's ACLU are finally causing damage. BUT unlike some of his other vulnerable colleagues, Burr hasn't backed away from Trump in the least. Early vote in the Tar Heel State shows Democrats with a big early advantage, which doesn't encourage Republicans here. 8. Nevada (Open, D-Harry Reid is retiring) Previous rank: 5 This lone offensive opportunity looked a lot better for Republicans even weeks ago, but now the state's blue leanings seem to be pulling this race the Democrats' way. GOP Rep. Joe Heck drew the ire of some Republicans at a rally when he denounced Trump for his 2005 hot-mike comments, and he does not need a divided base. Democratic turnout is way up in Nevada, and an increased Hispanic vote \u2014 coupled with the outgoing Senate minority leader's vaunted turnout operation \u2014 will certainly boost Democratic nominee Catherine Cortez Masto and just could make her the first Latina ever elected to the Senate. 9. Florida (R-Marco Rubio) Previous rank: 8 The polls show this one as being closer than it probably is in reality. It would have required a massive investment from Democrats to help their nominee, Rep. Patrick Murphy, after Rubio reversed his decision and decided to run for re-election. Ultimately, Democrats had better, cheaper opportunities elsewhere. The partisan nature of the Sunshine State is that it's always going to be a close outcome, and if Trump bottoms out here it could still hurt Rubio. But Republicans are breathing much easier about this one. 10. Arizona (R-John McCain) Previously not ranked This contest gets back on the board simply because the state is now, surprisingly enough, a White House battleground that even some Republicans believe Clinton will win. McCain still has a sizable advantage over Democratic Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick, although this race is now worth watching on Election Night again. Dropped from the list: Ohio Senate (R-Rob Portman) Republicans will hold up Portman's campaign as a model for how to run as an incumbent in tough political terrain \u2014 spend early, focus on local issues and highlight your accomplishments. Meanwhile, former Democratic Gov. Ted Strickland's campaign may be a cautionary tale for Democrats \u2014 don't assume that onetime popularity will carry forward and don't let your opponent define you. Portman may not get a double digit win thanks to the overall election tightening in the Buckeye State, but neither party sees this as truly competitive any longer.",

            "article_content": "Ohio has long been considered the ultimate bellwether \u2014 and it's one of the most contested battleground states in the country. As Hillary Clinton pulls ahead in other key states, we'll look at why the race continues to be so tight there.  MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: Throughout the show today, we're checking in with states still up for grabs as we come down to the wire. Elsewhere this hour, we'll hear from Arizona. First, NPR's Asma Khalid - she went to Ohio to figure out why the race there is so tight. ASMA KHALID, BYLINE: As the United States has changed, Ohio has not changed as much. It's whiter - 80 percent white - and less highly educated than the country. MATT MORRISON: There's no way to get to a majority of the vote or even a plurality without making major gains amongst white working-class voters. KHALID: That's Matt Morrison with the group Working America. They're affiliated with the AFL-CIO and have endorsed Hillary Clinton. All year, they've been knocking on doors in middle-class neighborhoods across Ohio. (SOUNDBITE OF KNOCKING) KHALID: They focus on economic issues. SARAH ROSENBLUM: How confident or concerned are you about your economic future and your family's economic future? THOMAS ROSE: Right now, I'm pretty concerned. KHALID: That's Thomas Rose talking to a Working America canvasser in South Columbus. ROSE: Me, I've been kind of trying to find my career path. I've done forklifting for a few years. And I actually just recently got into electricity. KHALID: Rose says if the election were today, he would vote for Donald Trump. The canvasser, Sarah Rosenblum, tells him they are supporting Hillary Clinton and the Democrat for Senate here, Ted Strickland. ROSENBLUM: They both want to raise the minimum wage to $12 an hour. And like you were saying, you know, the economy, it affects us all, so... KHALID: And Rose seems receptive to talking about the economy with her, but this is an uphill battle. Barack Obama lost white working-class voters in Ohio. And 2016 is even more challenging for Democrats because Donald Trump is specifically courting these voters. But at the same time, Trump has repelled some traditionally Republican suburban women. Lehner's Pumpkin Farm is in Delaware County, a deep red pocket of the state, and it's here that I meet Cindy Hajjar near the corn maze and the sling shot where you can aim a pumpkin at Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton. CINDY HAJJAR: I am a registered Republican. To be honest, I don't want to vote for either one of them. KHALID: Hajjar says she has a lot of reservations about Clinton, but if she had to vote today, she'd probably choose Clinton. HAJJAR: I guess the one thing that only sways me a little bit toward Hillary is just because of how bold and crude and rude Trump sounds. KHALID: But there is one other factor. In 2012, Obama did not win a majority of the white vote. In fact, exit polls show Mitt Romney beat him by double digits, but Obama still managed to win the state because he had huge turnout among black voters who supported him 96 percent to 3. It's not clear that Clinton can match that, but President Obama was in Cleveland Friday trying to help her. Alea Warren was in the crowd. She says the president's stamp of approval really matters to her. ALEA WARREN: But it's made me throw my support even further more behind Hillary seeing that Obama and Michelle are supporting her. KHALID: To win Ohio, Clinton needs support from these three groups together - black voters, white working-class folks and white suburban women. And that is a complicated coalition.

            "article_content": "President Obama campaigned for Hillary Clinton in Ohio Friday where the race is tight in this battleground state.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: It has been exactly one week since an 11-year-old \"Access Hollywood\" videotape of Donald Trump upended the presidential race and sparked a national conversation about unwanted sexual advances. We're going to hear about where things stand today from several angles, including how the GOP is grappling with the fallout. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: But first we have a report from a key battleground state. President Obama is on a campaign blitz for Hillary Clinton. Three days this week he was out on the road trying to energize the coalition of voters that won him the White House. NPR's Asma Khalid reports from Cleveland, Ohio. ASMA KHALID, BYLINE: President Obama was welcomed with shouts of, we love you, and, four more years. Cleveland after all is Democratic turf. And when some folks booed Donald Trump, Obama pulled out his classic campaign line. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Don't boo. What do I say? UNIDENTIFIED CROWD: Vote. OBAMA: Don't boo. Vote. KHALID: Obama is making a direct plea to millennials and African-Americans. Here in Ohio, about 80 percent of voters in 2012 were white. Obama did not win a majority of them but still managed to win the state because he did phenomenally well among people of color. Democrats need those voters to show up on Election Day. And Obama said Trump is trying to drag the election as low as it can go. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) OBAMA: And he figures that if he makes our politics just toxic, then maybe you'll just figure out, you've got no good choices, and you just get discouraged, and you just don't vote. But don't fall for it. KHALID: Ohio is also home to a large white, working-class population. And Obama made a pitch for them, too. He said Trump has no record of helping working people. He spent all his time trying to convince folks he was a, quote, \"global elite.\" (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) OBAMA: All he had time for was celebrities, and now suddenly he's acting like he's a populist out there. Man, I'm going to fight for working people. Come on, man. KHALID: Obama is trying to fight apathy and deliver his 2012 winning coalition over to Clinton. But this election is also personal for him, an effort to maintain his legacy. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) OBAMA: Donald Trump's closing argument is, what do you have to lose? The answer is everything. All the progress we've made right now is on the ballot. Civility is on the ballot. Tolerance is on the ballot. Courtesy is on the ballot. KHALID: And this kind of messaging, when Obama ties himself to Clinton, works. Alicia Warren was in the crowd sporting an Obama jacket she bought at the 2012 inauguration. ALICIA WARREN: I want to vote for Hillary because I believe in her. I believe in Obama, and I love Michelle Obama. KHALID: Warren is totally committed to Clinton, but there are voters like Tiffany Battle. She says she doesn't agree with everything Clinton's done. Battle was here with her 8-year-old daughter who's only lived under an Obama presidency. And for her, Obama's blessings are helpful. TIFFANY BATTLE: It has influenced by feelings toward her. KHALID: Battle is a reluctant Clinton voter, but the president's endorsement makes her feel more comfortable with her choice. BATTLE: The person that I've witnessed over the past eight years would not just slap his name on somebody as an endorsement, you know, just because he doesn't like whoever. You know, I think he really thought about it, and they've been working closely together. So I'm hoping that it pans out. KHALID: And that is why Obama is on this campaign blitz - to convince voters who trust him that they should trust her. Asma Khalid, NPR News, Cleveland. Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.

As part of an election-year project called A Nation Engaged, NPR has been asking people this presidential election year what it means to be an American. The country is changing \u2014 it's getting browner, as population growth slows among whites. Non-whites now make up a majority of kindergartners; by the next presidential election, the Census Bureau predicts they will be a majority of all children; and by 2044, no one racial group will be a majority of the country. America is at a demographic inflection point. The crosscurrents of demographic and cultural change are upending traditional voting patterns and straining the fabric of what it means to be American. These shifts are also altering the face of the American political parties in significant ways. The Democratic and Republican parties as we know them are changing \u2014 college-educated whites in this election have been moving more toward Democrats, as blue-collar whites are continuing their long trend toward Republicans. The only question is whether these trends are Donald Trump-specific or something more permanent? 2016 could be the first time Democrats win college-educated whites since formal exit polling began in 1976. That's mostly because of women. College-educated white women have indicated they prefer Hillary Clinton by up to 20 points in some polls, a big reversal from 2012, when college-educated white women narrowly preferred Mitt Romney over Barack Obama. In the meantime, Republicans have become increasingly reliant on white, working-class voters, a shrinking share of the voting public. In 1980, they were two-thirds of the electorate. By 2012, they were just over a third. This shift among white voters is happening at a time when non-white voters are growing at rate never seen before in U.S. history. 2016 could be the first election in which the white vote is at or below 70 percent as a share of the electorate. In 1976, whites made up 89 percent of the electorate, and that held fairly steady until 1992. After that, as Latino and Asian immigration increased, and the black population held steady, the white vote has been set on a steady decline. By 2012, whites were 72 percent of electorate, still a significant majority, but it was enough of a drop for Obama to win election with just 39 percent of the white vote \u2014 the lowest winning share for any Democrat in a two-way presidential race. The Democratic Party has adapted to this demographic change, and is more diverse, more urban and more liberal than at any time in its history. The Republican Party, on the other hand, has struggled. After losing a record margin of Latinos in in the 2012 presidential election, the Republican National Committee was explicit, in a post-election report, that it needed to be more present in black and brown communities. On policy, it called for Republicans to endorse immigration reform. Of course, the 2013 immigration reform bill died in Congress \u2014 with Republicans standing in the way, despite it passing the Senate with 68 votes. Democrats, though, face their own demographic challenges. After sweeping midterm losses in 2010 and 2014, the party put out a report of its own, pointedly noting that it needed to figure out ways to win over Southern and rural whites. No political divide is starker than that between urban and rural voters. Millennials, which now outnumber baby boomers, are likely to be the largest voting bloc in this election. But it's a group with which Hillary Clinton has struggled, especially younger millennials. President Obama was able to win record margins and turnout from young voters, but dissatisfaction with this year's candidates is moving a not-insignificant chunk in the direction of third-party candidates, like Libertarian Gary Johnson, according to recent surveys. Whether that holds up by Election Day could be a crucial factor in key states. Despite the needs of both parties to bridge these divides, in this election, the gaps could be wider than ever. The gender gap is shaping up to be the largest in presidential history \u2014 and women have made up the majority of the electorate in every election since 1984. Latinos could go Democratic in margins never seen before, as some polls show Donald Trump doing worse than Romney with the group in 2012. Romney won just 27 percent of Hispanics. And, it's possible, Hillary Clinton wins an even lower share of whites than Obama. It's not just a story leading up to this election, but it will also be one about how the country changes politically after it.

            "article_content": "Hillary Clinton is campaigning in Ohio on Monday for the first time in weeks. She plans to discuss her vision for a more equitable economy as well as Donald Trump's taxes. Ohio is a state whose demographics favor Donald Trump with a greater number of blue collar white voters. Hillary Clinton has not been in Ohio in weeks but recently received the endorsement of hometown NBA hero LeBron James.  AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: The new week is bringing new revelations in the race for president. The New York Attorney General's office revealed today that it has ordered Donald Trump's charitable foundation to stop fundraising in the state. Now, this comes a few days after a report from The New York Times that shows Trump had a net loss of more than $915 million on his federal income taxes in the mid-90s. We'll hear more about both in a moment but first how Hillary Clinton is capitalizing on that report. She's campaigning in Ohio, and NPR's Asma Khalid is traveling with the Clinton campaign and joins us now. And Asma, to start, what was Clinton's focus in Ohio today? ASMA KHALID, BYLINE: So yeah, Audie, this speech here in Toledo this afternoon was about the economy and Clinton's vision for building a more equitable corporate America. But the big headline was her response to Donald Trump's taxes and that story you mentioned that came out over the weekend in The Times. Today she ripped into her opponent. She spent more than seven minutes questioning his ethics and business acumen. And in particular she, you know, questioned how he could have declared an almost $1 billion loss in 1995 as The Times reported. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) HILLARY CLINTON: Now, how anybody can lose a dollar, let alone a billion dollars in the casino industry is kind of beyond me, right? (LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE) CLINTON: It's just hard to figure. But as a result, it doesn't look like he paid a dime of federal income tax for almost two decades. KHALID: Of course, Audie, it's impossible to know for sure how much money Donald Trump could or may have paid in federal income tax because Trump has not released his tax returns. But still, you know, the Clinton campaign is using this as an attack line. And she also raised questions about his own tax plan. You know, a lot of economists who've analyzed his plans say that it would actually cut taxes even more for the ultra-rich. CORNISH: So beyond Trump, what will Hillary Clinton's message be in Ohio? KHALID: She specifically talked about defending people's right to organize. You know, unions are a huge factor in northern Ohio. And she also talked about trade. You know, this is something where Donald Trump has made inroads and tried to attack her, suggesting that many Rust Belt workers here had been hit hard by some trade deals that were approved during her husband's presidency. Clinton, though, tried to show that she's with these voters on their trade concerns and that she will not support the Trans-Pacific Partnership. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CLINTON: I oppose TPP now. I will oppose it after the election. I will oppose it as president because it is one-sided and unfair to American workers. (CHEERING, APPLAUSE) KHALID: And she insisted that she would advocate for having some sort of exit tax in place for companies that try to shift their headquarters overseas. CORNISH: You know, Asma, Hillary Clinton hasn't been to Ohio much in the last month. Why not? KHALID: Well, Audie, Ohio has long been considered this ultimate bellwether. But I, you know, normally cover demographics, and I think that the demographics here are really interesting because they don't seem to represent the way that a changing America looks. Ohio has a large white, working-class population, and that's a group whose political power has been declining across the country. So all this is to say that the demographics here seem to tilt more in Donald Trump's favor. And there's been some thought that maybe Hillary Clinton is OK with conceding Ohio to Trump. You know, I should mention she did get a big-name endorsement last night here from Cleveland Cavs star LeBron James. You know, whether that's enough to actually sway this state - who knows? But Ohio - yes, it's an important state, but I would say its importance electorally could be shrinking because Hillary Clinton can lose the state and still have a very viable path to the White House. CORNISH: That's NPR's Asma Khalid traveling with the Clinton campaign. Thanks so much. KHALID: You're welcome. Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump offered a bold prediction Thursday that his economic plan will deliver up to 25 million new jobs over the next decade. He described the blueprint as \"the most pro-growth, pro-jobs, pro-family plan put forth perhaps in the history of our country.\" Trump's projections are based on rosy forecasts of the job gains that would result from tax cuts and reduced regulation. He set a goal of 4 percent annual economic growth. And he says that under his plan the U.S. would achieve a minimum of 3.5 percent annual growth over 10 years. The U.S. has achieved that growth rate only once in the past 15 years. Speaking to the New York Economic Club, Trump also called for cuts to federal spending, which he says would save the government up to a trillion dollars over the next decade. His proposal would shave 1 percent off the government's discretionary, nondefense spending each year. But since he's excluding programs such as Social Security and Medicare, the cuts would affect only about 16 percent of the total federal budget. \"This is more than just tinkering,\" said Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. \"Achieving those savings will require more than just finding efficiencies. It will require tough choices over which programs to scale back and it still leaves the most problematic parts of the budget untouched.\" Trump is counting on savings from the spending cuts to help offset the revenue loss from his tax cuts, in order to avoid increasing the deficit. Like his jobs target, the pledge of deficit neutrality is based on aggressive projections about the resulting economic growth. \"Certainly we should put in place policies that will help grow the economy but this is relying on heroic assumptions,\" MacGuineas said. If growth fails to meet those rosy targets, the result would be trillions of dollars in additional debt. The Trump campaign also released new details about the candidate's tax plan that could make it less favorable to wealthy taxpayers. Trump wants to cap tax deductions at $100,000 for single filers and $200,000 for married couples. That could offset some savings that wealthy taxpayers would get from cutting the top tax rate from 39.6 to 33 percent. \"The tax relief will be concentrated on the working and middle-class taxpayers,\" Trump said. \"They will receive the biggest benefit and it won't even be close.\" A review by the conservative Tax Foundation of a similar plan put forward by House Republicans found wealthy taxpayers get the biggest break from reduced rates. But the cap on deductions in Trump's plan could alter that arithmetic. Families living in high-tax states with high real-estate prices would be among those most affected by limiting tax deductions. Trump also renewed his promise to boost domestic energy production and reduce regulations such as President Obama's Clean Power Plan. And he vowed to renegotiate trade deals. An analysis by Moody's Analytics released in June projected that Trump's trade policies would raise consumer prices in the United States and reduce exports. (The lead author of the Moody's report, Mark Zandi, has contributed the maximum $2,700 to Hillary Clinton's campaign.)",

Donald Trump is once again taking the fight to Democrats and Hillary Clinton. During a week in which the Republican presidential nominee has been attacking Clinton for disparaging half of his supporters as \"deplorables,\" Trump plans to roll out a new proposal that treads deep into the core issues that Clinton and other Democrats regularly campaign on: making child care more accessible and affordable. In a speech Tuesday evening in suburban Philadelphia, Trump is expected, according to campaign aides, to go into more detail on a proposal he originally laid out last month in a wide-ranging economic speech \u2014 allowing parents to deduct the average cost of child care from their taxes. How the plan works Trump's expanded plan would allow parents to deduct the average cost of child care from their taxes. The campaign says this is focused on \"working and middle-class families,\" though its income caps \u2014 $250,000 for individuals and $500,000 for couples \u2014 far exceed most people's definition of working class. After his economic speech last month, Trump was criticized for a plan that didn't do anything for those who don't earn enough to pay federal income taxes. They wouldn't be able to take advantage of the deductions, and because child care costs what it costs, it has an outsize impact on the poor. To address this, Trump's campaign unveiled child care rebates \u2014 up to $1,200, staffers say \u2014 to provide benefits to people who currently don't earn enough to pay federal income taxes. The Trump campaign says that stay-at-home parents would also be eligible for the same tax deductions working parents currently receive. As CNBC found in its analysis when Trump's plan was unveiled last month, Trump's plan \"would create a substantial tax break for working parents, but further widen the deficit.\" That's because: \"On average, households with a woman working outside her home and taking care of a child under 15 paid an average $127 a week on child care, according to a Census Bureau analysis of 2010 data. That works out to about $6,600 a year. With some 24 million households in that category, the child-care tax break would cost the government $158 billion a year. \"For families paying for child care, the current tax break offers little relief. Only 3.5 million tax returns claimed the existing child-care tax credit for the 2010 tax year, according to IRS data, saving those households $1.9 billion. (Nearly 10 million returns claimed a separate tax credit for all parents, whether or not the family had child-care expenses, for another $14 billion in tax savings.) \"So total out-of-pocket child-care costs amounted to about $142 billion, which a Trump administration would either have to make up with higher taxes or add to the budget deficit.\" Along with all this, the campaign is now promising to \"guarantee\" six weeks of paid maternity leave. (Paternity leave is not mentioned.) Clinton's proposal would be open to fathers as well. She also wants to institute a hard cap on families' child care costs, at 10 percent of their overall income. Tax-free savings accounts Trump would also create a Dependent Care Savings Account, which would allow \"tax-deductible contributions and tax-free appreciation year-to-year,\" according to a campaign-provided fact sheet. What's more, the government would match half of the first $1,000 deposited per year. That could come at a whopping cost. There are some 124 million households in the U.S., about 43 percent of which include children. That's more than 50 million households. If all of those families put in $1,000 per year, it would cost the government $25 billion annually. Even if half of all families contributed to it, that's still a big price tag, and the Trump campaign outlines no way to pay for it. Not to mention that that kind of benefit doesn't help the families who can't afford to put that much in per year. Trump campaign policy adviser Stephen Miller told NPR's Sarah McCammon that a Trump administration would focus on fraud to finance the family leave portion. Miller's estimate was $5.3 billion in unemployment insurance fraud, which the campaign believes it can recoup half of. Republicans wary of increasing government spending frequently suggest funding new proposals by saying they will eliminate fraud. \"We estimate we can easily recover $2.5 [billion] for paid leave,\" Miller said. That still would leave a sizable gap in how to pay for the overall plan. Miller added, \"The rest is paid for through comprehensive tax and economic reform.\" And the campaign believes it would be \"deficit-neutral.\" But if that's based on \"growth,\" that can always be a murky calculation. Trump has already overhauled his tax plan once during this election campaign. One outside analysis of his initial tax plan estimated a 10-year cost to taxpayers of $9.5 trillion. An economic adviser to Trump estimated in August his updated plan would cost $3 trillion over a decade. The Trump campaign says Trump's daughter Ivanka was deeply involved in coming up with this proposal. It echoes a notable line from her speech at the Republican National Convention in July, when she told Republicans that Trump would \"focus on making quality child care affordable and accessible for all.\" Democrats have long pushed for guaranteed paid family leave, but many Republicans in Congress have been resistant because of the cost to employers.",

Evan Bayh's late entrance into the race gives Democrats a new pick-up opportunity and forces Republicans to play defense in a state they hadn't expected. Republicans were already at a massive disadvantage when it came to the 2016 Senate map \u2014 defending more than double the number of seats as Democrats. To compound matters, many of those endangered Republicans were sitting in swing state territory in a presidential year where the electorate already leans more liberal. Donald Trump's once-sagging poll numbers rebounded nationally after cratering post-convention. He's doing better now in battlegrounds where he needs to win the White House \u2014 and where Republicans are defending their toughest Senate seats \u2014 but overall still narrowly lags Hillary Clinton. Some Republican seats once thought to be sure-wins for Democrats, such as Ohio and Florida, are moving off the table. But now, seats in typically safe GOP turf, such as Indiana and Missouri, are at real risk of flipping. It's a much different path to the majority than either party had expected. But ultimately, two months away from Election Day, there are plentiful pick-up opportunities for Democrats to get to the five seats they need (or four with a Clinton victory) to win the majority. Many of the races have tightened \u2014 and Republicans are still very much in the game \u2014 but it's increasingly looking like a narrow majority for Democrats is the most probable outcome. Here are our latest ranking of the Senate seats most likely to flip on Nov. 8. Check out our previous rankings here. 1. Illinois (R-Kirk) Previous rank: 1 Mark Kirk has tried his best to separate himself from his party's nominee. In May, he became the first GOP senator up for re-election to withdraw his endorsement of Donald Trump after the Republican nominee made derisive comments about Mexican-American Judge Gonzalo Curiel. He followed that up with an anti-Trump TV ad touting his independence. When Trump met with Senate Republicans last month, he singled Kirk out as a \"loser\" and predicted he would carry the state in the presidential race. The reality is that Trump will surely lose the heavily blue state in a landslide. While Kirk will run ahead of him, the already hostile climate coupled with a good candidate in Democratic Rep. Tammy Duckworth make it nearly impossible for him to continue his previous streak of unlikely wins on blue turf. 2. Wisconsin (R-Johnson) Previous rank: 2 Most Republicans agree the next incumbent most likely to lose is Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson. A recent Monmouth University poll gave former Democratic Sen. Russ Feingold a double-digit lead in his rematch with Johnson, though the well-respected Marquette University Law School poll gave Feingold a much slimmer 4-point advantage. Unlike some of his other endangered Republican colleagues, the first-term incumbent hasn't moderated many of his stances. Koch-backed groups cancelled their planned ads to help boost Johnson, though they did go back in early in August. Still, the national party has delayed ads as well. Overall, the writing on the wall isn't great for Johnson. 3. Indiana (R-open, Coats retiring) Previously not ranked Republican Sen. Dan Coats announced in 2015 that he would not seek re-election. The biggest surprise of the cycle was former Democratic Sen. Evan Bayh's decision to make a late entrance into the Senate race despite multiple, often forceful, denials he was interested in returning to politics. He's the only Democrat in the state who could have put the race into play. Republicans hope the statewide ticket is boosted by Trump's running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, though he has a middling approval rating in the state. By all accounts, the famed political scion remains popular in the state. But like former GOP Sen. Richard Lugar, he's been beset by questions about his residency, and Republicans are hammering him on just how much time he's spent there since he decided to retire in 2010. He moved to a $2.9 million house in Washington and worked for a lobbying firm, and he was deemed an \"inactive\" voter. In interviews, he's stumbled to recite his Indianapolis address, and neighbors say they never even knew he lived there. This race is just beginning to engage, and too many missteps may have already wiped away Bayh's early advantage. He started out with a double-digit lead, but a poll Friday from WTHR and Howey Politics, the most widely read political blog in the state, showed Bayh is only up 4 points. GOP Rep. Todd Young still has to introduce himself to voters, but Bayh can't take his triumphant return for granted. 4. Pennsylvania (R-Toomey) Previous rank: 4 GOP Sen. Pat Toomey has done plenty to try and bolster his centrist credentials. One of the leading Republicans calling for gun control, he was endorsed by former Rep. Gabby Giffords' group, Americans for Responsible Solutions. He's been critical of Trump and has withheld his endorsement. The Keystone State is a place where Trump had hoped to make gains, given its white working-class population. Most recent surveys show former state environmental chief Katie McGinty edging him out narrowly, but a Quinnipiac poll on Friday gave him a 1-point lead. McGinty had some unforced errors after she won the April primary that raised some questions about the discipline of her campaign, but Democrats say those are behind her. Toomey isn't doing well with the suburban voters he needs to win over, and he's got to make up ground there to have a chance to hang on. 5. Nevada (D-open, Reid retiring) Previous rank: 7 This is Republicans' lone offensive opportunity, and it's increasingly becoming a must-win if they want any hope of keeping the Senate. Despite the state's sizable Hispanic population, Trump is holding his own in Nevada \u2014 and by extension, so is GOP Senate nominee, Rep. Joe Heck. Recent polls have been within the margin of error, but Heck hasn't trailed in a poll since May. But with Hispanic registration surging in the state, Democrats hope Clinton will soon open a wider lead that helps former state Attorney General Catherine Cortez Masto. And the vaunted turnout machine of retiring Democratic Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid has helped win close contests before. 6. New Hampshire (R-Ayotte) Previous rank: 3 The Granite State contest is one of the most consistently evenly matched races this cycle in the only race between two women. For much of the year, incumbent GOP Sen. Kelly Ayotte and Democratic Gov. Maggie Hassan seemed to be pretty evenly matched. An NBC/Marist poll released Sunday showed Ayotte opening up an 8-point lead, though that large a lead could be an outlier. Democrats have hit Ayotte for trying to have it both ways of sorts with the top of the ticket remaining critical of Trump and saying she won't endorse him even though she is supporting her party's nominee. That waffling led Trump to criticize her in an interview with The Washington Post last month \u2014 something that may be more beneficial to her campaign. He eventually relented and has endorsed her. Trump also hasn't spent any money on-air here yet, and Republicans worry the TV edge Clinton has will help Hassan. This race has seesawed back and forth between the two for the past year, and the presidential contest will have a huge impact. 7. North Carolina (R-Burr) Previous rank: 9 Republican Sen. Richard Burr has been slow to shift into high gear for his tough re-election challenge. He has barely been campaigning \u2014 and even told the AP he doesn't see himself as a candidate until October when the Senate adjourns. His Democratic opponent, former state Rep. Deborah Ross, has outraised him in recent filings, and she's looking to piggyback not just on anti-Trump sentiment in the state but also the general sour mood of the state GOP in North Carolina, after many controversies in the general assembly, including the so-called \"bathroom bill.\" Republican Gov. Pat McCrory trails for re-election, so that's another complication for Burr. National Republicans have been working to paint Ross as too extreme, pointing to her time as executive director of the state's ACLU. But Burr has a real race on his hands \u2014 a Quinnipiac poll only gave him a 4 point edge \u2014 and he hasn't seemed to fully grasp that yet. 8. Florida (R-Rubio) Previous rank: 6 What was once one of Democrats likeliest pick-ups evaporated when Sen. Marco Rubio decided to run for re-election after all. He was humiliated in the state's GOP presidential primary just months before, but he easily beat back a primary challenge from wealthy homebuilder Carlos Beruff. Democrats also got their preferred nominee, centrist Rep. Patrick Murphy, instead of controversial progressive Rep. Alan Grayson. Even though Murphy survived the primary, he has plenty of his own troubles to overcome. The Miami CBS station aired a devastating two-part story on how Murphy had inflated and exaggerated key pieces of his background, including being a CPA (he was licensed in Colorado, not Florida) and his how many contracts for the Gulf oil spill his environmental clean-up company received. Trump has climbed back in Florida, but even before that Rubio had continued to consistently hang on over Murphy in several recent surveys. Democrats hope that some of the same issues that hurt Rubio in his White House run, including his high absentee rate from the Senate, will be salient again. And they're painting him as someone who's already looking ahead to another presidential bid in 2020 and not fully committed to serving out his term. 9. Missouri (R-Blunt) Previous rank: 8 The Show-Me-State contest has gotten tighter, although GOP Sen. Roy Blunt continues to hold a slim lead in recent polls. Democrat Jason Kander, a young Afghanistan veteran, remains one of their best recruits who increasingly worries Republicans. Republicans also privately say Blunt hasn't grasped the seriousness of the threat, and was even spotted in D.C. at a farmer's market during the August recess instead of pounding the campaign trail back home. In a year for Washington outsiders, Blunt can't shake his insider status. The presidential race has tightened here too, giving Kander another boost, and national Democrats just bought ad time here. It's a race Democrats are increasingly optimistic about while Republicans are increasingly pessimistic. 10. Ohio (R-Portman) Previous rank: 5 Right now, Portman looks like he will survive any down-ballot drag from Trump. He was out early defining himself thanks to his $13 million war chest, and he's picked up several high-profile union endorsements too. He hasn't separated himself from Trump much though \u2014 he's said he would be open to campaigning with him this fall and he did attend the Republican National Convention in Cleveland even as the state's GOP governor, John Kasich, publicly boycotted Trump's coronation. But Strickland hasn't caught fire the way Democrats hoped he would, particularly with blue collar, downstate voters \u2014 the same voters Trump needs to win. National Democrats and outside groups are cancelling ad buys on Strickland's behalf \u2014 never a good sign, even though they could go back in. But there seems to be brewing frustration with Strickland, too. \"Portman has run a damn fine race...The rest, I'll have to tell you over a drink,\" the executive director of the Senate Democrats' campaign arm reportedly told a trade group. Honorable mention: Arizona (R-McCain) Previous rank: 10 Sen. John McCain easily dispatched with his primary challenge this week, but a tougher opponent looms in Democratic Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick. Republicans admit she shouldn't be underestimated, and she's consistently won tough races in her swing district. But they have to be breathing easier with an NBC/Marist poll over the weekend that showed McCain up 19 points. Still, the state is closer than it should be in the presidential race \u2014 Trump only led by 1 point in the same poll \u2014 and Clinton opened field offices there last month. Arizona has also seen a spike in Hispanic registration. The 2008 presidential nominee has reluctantly endorsed Trump though he has obvious disdain for him. Unfortunately, he needs the Trump conservative loyalists in the state in order to be victorious as well. For now, Democrats may focus on better pickup opportunities.",

            "article_content": "Labor day is traditionally the start of the last leg of the campaign season, and both campaigns on Monday made a pitch to working class voters. Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton made stops in Ohio, a state whose voters are critical to any presidential candidate.  AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: Labor Day is the traditional launch of the final campaign sprint towards Election Day. And even in this most unconventional campaign, both candidates are in traditional Labor Day mode. Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton crossed paths in Ohio, as did our own Scott Detrow and Tamara Keith. They're covering those campaigns. Hey there, Scott. Hey, Tamara. SCOTT DETROW, BYLINE: Hey, Audie. TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Hello. CORNISH: So, Scott, I want to start with you. What has Donald Trump's day been like? DETROW: Well, it actually looked like the kind of day you would see on Hillary Clinton's schedule - meetings with small groups of voters, really tightly-controlled settings. He was doing some one-on-one campaigning in diners - at the fair. Trump is typically focused on all these big rallies, and he'll be doing those tomorrow. But a day like this could be the latest sign that the last two months of the campaign for Donald Trump will be pretty traditional and pretty focused for a candidate who's been anything but all year. You know, he's brought in new management and more and more he's acting more and more like a typical candidate for president, which has not been the M.O. for Donald Trump this year. CORNISH: Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton has been relatively quiet these last few weeks. But, Tamara Keith, she's been doing public events, right? What was she up to today? KEITH: She's doing a couple of Labor Day picnics, which is very traditional. Organized labor and Democrats are like peanut butter and jelly, especially on Labor Day. And in particular, this is important for Clinton because there's been some concern that white working class - especially white working class men - might peel off. You know, back in March I was here in Cleveland talking to labor union members who were saying that they were tempted to vote for Trump. So Clinton is definitely - she is on the campaign trail today and for the rest of the week. Last week she was fundraising, and she was also doing debate prep because the first debate is about 20 days away. CORNISH: Tamara, how unusual is it for these candidates to be in Ohio at the same time? KEITH: Well, Ohio is the center of the political universe. It is the swing state of all swing states. So it's not entirely surprising that they would be here at the same time, though I was at the Cleveland airport waiting for Clinton's plane to come in and we were literally parked right next to a Trump plane and a Trump-Pence plane. So there was something of a traffic jam on the tarmac with all of these candidates right here in Cleveland. DETROW: And then actually later in the day, Audie, I was on a bus with other reporters covering Donald Trump, and we had to pull over so the Clinton motorcade could zip by us. So that shows you just how important Ohio is for this race. CORNISH: You know, Scott, Tamara also mentioned debate prep. And obviously the candidates are set to face off with each other in the first debate later this month. Did Trump talk about what he's doing to prepare? DETROW: He did. He took some questions from the press and said that he's preparing kind of the same way that he did for all of those primary debates that you saw earlier this year. There were about a dozen of those on cable news. They were pretty raucous affairs at times. You know, Trump talked about his anatomy at one point. That was certainly a first in presidential politics. And these fall debates are going to be much, much different. They're much more serious. Of course, there's only two candidates. But there have been a lot of questions about whether Trump would actually show up later this month for the first debate. He had been complaining a lot about them, about the schedule, saying that two of the debates go head-to-head with NFL games. And the fact that he skipped a debate on the eve of the Iowa caucuses made a lot of people think, well, maybe Trump won't show, or maybe he'll make a big thing of possibly not showing to kind of raise the drama. But Trump did say when asked today, do you plan on debating? He said, yes. He thinks they're very important. He looks forward to being there. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DONALD TRUMP: I think it's an important element of what we're doing. I think we have an obligation to do the debates. I did them with the other - you know, in the other cases. We had, I guess, 11 debates. No, I look forward to the debates. DETROW: And Audie, he's trailing in nearly every swing state at this point. He's trailing in the national polls. Those debates are a moment where millions and millions of people are tuning into the race and it could be his last big moment to really claw his way back into this. CORNISH: And Tamara, before I let you go, did we hear from Hillary Clinton's campaign on this? I know that they briefly spoke to the press as they unveiled that new plane. KEITH: Yes, so they unveiled a new plane that the press is actually flying on with her. A representative from the campaign tells me that she has been preparing extensively, but that they aren't talking about how she's preparing. And she does have a sparring partner, but they won't say who it is. CORNISH: That's Tamara Keith and Scott Detrow, traveling with the Clinton and Trump campaigns today in Ohio. Thanks so much to you both. DETROW: Any time. KEITH: You're welcome. Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is giving his adopted party a lot to think about. He has offered radically different approaches to trade, immigration, the size of government and national defense. Now Republicans are debating whether, win or lose, Donald Trump has permanently altered their party's DNA. Here are 4 questions that Republicans are grappling with: This is the fundamental chicken-and-egg question for Republicans. Did Donald Trump take over the Republican Party only because he's a billionaire reality TV celebrity who knew better than anyone, ever, how to dominate the media? Or did this all exist already within the party and is there such a thing as Trumpism that will live on regardless of whether Trump himself becomes president? Rather than making the Republican Party different, Trump is reflecting a Republican Party that's already changed. Some Republicans, like hotly anti-Trump Florida GOP strategist Rick Wilson, think Trump is one of a kind, a black-swan candidate. Wilson, who is an outspoken \"Never Trumper\" \u2014 he's running the campaign of independent candidate Evan McMullin \u2014 points to Sen. Marco Rubio's primary victory in Florida this week. Carlos Beruff, Rubio's opponent, was a multi-multimillionaire developer who ran as a Trump mini-me. As Wilson puts it, Beruff had the \"tough-guy swagger: build the wall, ship them home, that whole act,\" but Rubio ended up beating him by the curvature of the earth. That, says Wilson, proves that without Trump the man, Trumpism falls flat. \"Without the showmanship, the TV star personality,\" Wilson said, \"Trumpism is a dead letter.\" Of course, Rubio was the incumbent with very high name identification. And other Republicans say Trump has tapped into something very real in the GOP that's not going away anytime soon. Gary Bauer, a conservative activist and a Trump supporter, said rather than making the Republican Party different, Trump is reflecting a Republican Party that has already changed. As the Washington establishment grew increasingly out of touch with its voter base, Trump, Bauer said, \"understood where our votes were coming from. And I'm still fairly optimistic he's going to win. But whatever happens, I think it's going to be very hard for the Republican Party to go back to the agenda that it had before.\" The agenda it had before didn't care much about preserving Social Security or keeping young people out of endless foreign wars. It was an agenda, Bauer contended, that left out the working class, who are now the base of the Republican Party. Whatever happens, I think it's going to be very hard for the Republican Party to go back to the agenda that it had before. Gary Bauer, conservative activist If Trumpism is here to stay, it means the GOP is no longer a Bush party, or even a Paul Ryan party. It is no longer a party of entitlement reform, nation-building and big trade deals. It's a conservative populist party, oriented toward the white, working class rather than Wall Street or even the Chamber of Commerce. And if Trump were to continue to bleed educated whites, it would mean it's no longer a party of suburban white voters, which have been traditionally a critical group to the GOP. And that raises the next obvious question... If Trumpism is going to succeed at the ballot box, it has to have a broader appeal. Trump could still turn things around and win this November, but his lagging poll numbers nationally and in battleground states reflect how much his raw appeal to white identity politics has alienated young people, Hispanics, suburban women and college-educated voters. Those demographics are growing as a share of the electorate. Trump's base, on the other hand \u2014 the white working class \u2014 is shrinking. Wilson is worried about the damage Trump has already done to the Republican brand. Even if there won't be another billionaire reality TV celebrity running for president in the Republican Party any time soon, Wilson points to Trump's and the party's poor favorability among African-Americans and Hispanics. Trump has also hurt support for Republicans among college-educated professionals, white women and Catholics. \"He's essentially wrecked the GOP coalition,\" Wilson said. Conservative radio host Laura Ingraham doesn't buy that. \"I see the Republican Party as a conservative party that has a stronger populist strain than it's had since the Bushes,\" Ingraham said. \"That's what I see. And I think that agenda will appeal to a broader range of Americans as time goes on.\" Whether the party, though, can have that broader appeal might depend on whether it's possible to separate Trumpism from Trump's own racial rhetoric. Ben Domenech, the founder and publisher of The Federalist, asks: \"If you break Trumpism away from some of the toxic comments about immigrants, some of the race-baiting comments, at least when it comes to birtherism \u2014 if you break it away from that, does it still have the same appeal?\" That depends on the priorities of Trump's supporters \u2014 who made up a plurality of Republican primary voters. One of the most stunning revelations of this election cycle was just how much the Republican establishment misunderstood its own base. The leadership of the party and its donor class, Domenech said, \"thought their base was a bunch of ideologically conservative people who could be controlled in the same way you control a brush fire: controlled burns in controlled areas to keep it from going everywhere.\" But it turned out the base \u2014 or a least a significant portion of it \u2014 wasn't very ideological at all. They were people who felt they were being screwed \u2014 by immigrants, by Wall Street, by elites in general. They wanted someone to look out for them and they believe Trump understands them in a way Republican leaders do not. Even if Trump doesn't win in November, his voters are not going away. Republicans will have to find out if they can continue to engage these voters without the nativist, sometimes racist, rhetoric that makes it impossible for a Trumpist GOP to broaden its appeal. Just like Trump himself has tried to do in the last two weeks \u2014 with limited to no success \u2014 future Republican presidential candidates will try to make Trumpism more broadly acceptable without alienating the voters Trump has activated, because the Republican Party also needs them to win. Whether it's possible to sand down the rough edges of Trumpism without losing Trump's base is unclear. If Trump wins, he'll remake the GOP in his own unconventional image. If he loses, there will be a contentious internal debate about what Trump and Trumpism mean for the GOP. True to form, Trump has guaranteed that the debate about the GOP's future will be complicated and very difficult. That's because Trump has said that the only way he can lose is if the election is stolen from him. \"If he's already setting up the storyline after the election to be one of a stolen or rigged election,\" said former Congressman Vin Weber, \"then there's not any analysis that can be used to shed light on where the Republican Party ought to go, because his supporters will say simply, 'We don't need to make any changes. We just need to get rid of those elements that so-called stole the election.' \"",

Now Republicans are debating whether, win or lose, Donald Trump has permanently altered their party's DNA. NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson reports. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Is Donald Trump unique, taking over the Republican Party only because he's a billionaire reality TV celebrity who knew better than anyone how to dominate the media? Or is there such a thing as Trumpism that will live on regardless of whether Trump himself becomes president? Rick Wilson is a Never Trumper, and he says Trump is one of a kind, a black swan event.

RICK WILSON: A guy named Carlos Beruff, a multi-multimillionaire developer who ran as a Trump mini-me - you know, the whole tough guy swagger, build the wall, ship them home, that whole act - Marco Rubio is going to hand him his head today by a margin of probably 40 or 50 points. You know, that's a good case study, a good experiment that without Donald Trump, Trumpism falls flat. Without the showmanship, the TV star personality, Trumpism a dead letter. LIASSON: But other Republicans say Trump has tapped into something very real in the GOP that's not going away anytime soon. Gary Bauer is a conservative activist and a Trump supporter.

LIASSON: Whether Trump wins or loses, Ingraham says, the GOP will never again be the party of entitlement reform, open borders, nation-building and big trade deals. But in order for this new Trumpist agenda to appeal to a broad range of Americans it has to appeal to young people, minorities and suburban women, all groups that Trump himself has alienated with his raw appeals to white identity politics. Conservative Ben Domenech is the founder and publisher of The Federalist. BEN DOMENECH: The question for me is if you break Trumpism away from some of the toxic comments about immigrants, some of the race-baiting comments, at least when it comes to birtherism - if you break it away from that, does it still have the same appeal? And I think that there's going to be a lot of Republicans, particularly ones with ambitions on the presidency themselves, who try to test that out and figure it out. LIASSON: Just like Trump himself has tried to do in the last two weeks, these future Republican candidates will try to make Trumpism more broadly acceptable without alienating the voters Trump has activated because the Republican Party also needs them to win. So the conversation about just what Trump and Trumpism means for the GOP has begun and, true to form, Trump has made this discussion potentially perilous for his party because he has said the only way he can lose is if the election is stolen from him.

But his campaign believes the enthusiasm generated from Trump's visits will propel him to victory.  M L SCHULTZE, BYLINE: I'm M.L. Schultze in Ohio. No Republican has won the White House without winning Ohio, so we've been seeing Donald Trump a lot here. He'll be in Akron Monday - his second visit to Northeast Ohio in just a week. Bob Paduchik, the state director for the Trump campaign, says they need to mobilize thousands of working-class voters. BOB PADUCHIK: The best way for us to do that is for through the candidate, Mr. Trump himself. That's why we have him here so much, and I expect we'll continue to see him here in Ohio. SCHULTZE: But do check isn't sharing too many details about Trump's Ohio campaign. But for months, Trump was lagging Clinton in campaign offices, ads and staff. In addition, Trump is running without the endorsement of the state's most popular office holder, Governor John Kasich, and the at-best tepid support of many other high-profile Republicans. Tracey Winbush is the state's central committee treasurer. She was a fierce critic of Trump before Ohio's March primary, but she's come around, and she says Trump loyalists are taking over. TRACEY WINBUSH: The Ohio Republican Party is working actively with the Donald Trump campaign to win the election. Now, the same people may not be working, but that was their choice. SCHULTZE: The stronger relationship, however, appears to be between the Trump campaign and county parties. Earlier this month, the campaign announced he's opening 16 new offices with more to come. Many of those headquarters are sharing space with county Republican parties. That's the case in Youngstown where Trump made his most recent Ohio campaign stop. DONNA BRICKER: If you notice, the regional chamber gave us the 3D-printed bobble head doll of Trump. SCHULTZE: Mahoning County chairwoman Donna Bricker holds the hand of the life-size Trump. She's worked on Republican campaigns since she was a girl and Eisenhower was running and says she supported Trump before it was cool. Also sharing the space is Thomas Batten (ph), a Trump volunteer here from Indiana. He and Bricker say voters are excited. THOMAS BATTEN: I get my lists of people to go to, and they're very receptive to Trump. BRICKER: If we run out of shirts or buttons or hats, they - they're - when am I going to get them? They're excited. When can I come back? How long are you open? SCHULTZE: Trump's Ohio campaign has been adding staff recently. And for the first time, it had a response team set up outside a Hillary Clinton event this past week. But state director Paduchik says the strength of the campaign remains the same - the enthusiasm of Trump's supporters. For NPR News, I'm M.L. Schultze in Akron, Ohio. Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.

It's a line that draws thunderous applause at Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's campaign rallies, one that can sometimes even bring the crowd to its feet: Let's bring back America's lost manufacturing jobs. And is there any question why? The United States has lost nearly 5 million manufacturing jobs since 2000 alone, hollowing out factory towns all over the country and leaving countless working-class Americans struggling. Getting those jobs back is a goal that politicians of all stripes eagerly line up behind. But the plain truth is that, legally speaking, there's not a lot that Trump or any other president could do to bring those jobs back, without an act of Congress. Presidents simply don't have the power to tell companies whom to hire or where to manufacture, says Jeffrey Bergstrand, professor of finance at the Mendoza College of Business at the University of Notre Dame. \"Firms are going to make the decisions for their shareholders. If he wants to do this, he is going to have to use government institutions and laws to restrict the decisions of firms,\" Bergstrand says. And it's not at all clear Congress would support such an effort. What presidents can do is try to make it tough for companies that ship jobs overseas to make money in the United States, by imposing tariffs on their products. Trump has often talked about doing so. At a rally in Pennsylvania last Friday, Trump talked about slapping heavy tariffs on the air conditioners made by the Carrier division of United Technologies, which recently decided to move part of its Indiana manufacturing operations to Mexico. \"Every single unit you make that crosses our now very, very strong border, we're going to charge you 35 percent of the cost of that unit,\" Trump told the crowd. He has also talked about imposing even larger tariffs on goods imported from China. Presidents do have the power to impose tariffs unilaterally in the interest of national security, although it's rarely been done, says Chad Bown, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. The last time was in 1971, when President Nixon imposed a surcharge on imports to prevent a run on the dollar after the U.S. went off the gold standard. Bown notes that just because a president can impose tariffs doesn't mean doing so is a good idea. \"We would lose the tens of billions a year in soybean exports we send to China, and corn and wheat and autos, and all of the people that work in those sectors now all of a sudden are going to be losing their jobs,\" Bown says. Such a move would almost certainly invite retaliation by other countries, hurting U.S. companies that export. \"China's going to respond by raising tariffs on us and restricting goods,\" Bergstrand says. \"Then other actors and other countries around the world are going to start raising tariffs. And that's actually what pushed the world economy ... into the Great Depression.\" The long-term ramifications of a tariff war would be hugely disruptive to businesses all over the world, casting a pall over the entire superstructure of international trade. \"If I'm running a business and it's unclear to me if Donald Trump is going to allow me to be able to import parts and components to allow me to make my particular good, I don't know what to do,\" Bown says. \"In the end, because we're all tied together, what's going to happen is there's going to be a huge reduction in demand for goods and services, and it's going to cut off the entire global supply chain of economic activity,\" Bergstrand says. Presidents can take a lot of steps to make it easier for companies to manufacture domestically, by addressing tax and regulatory reform, for instance, says Aric Newhouse, senior vice president of policy and government relations at the National Association of Manufacturers. He says presidents can also open talks with foreign countries to encourage them to open their markets to U.S. goods. \"It's really, unfortunately, not one magic bullet,\" Newhouse says. \"It's not, if you do this one thing, manufacturing is going to come back to the United States. You have to do a little bit of a lot of things.\" But such efforts would take time, and even if they succeed, they won't necessarily mean the return of a lot of jobs. The common perception is that manufacturing jobs have disappeared because they've been sent to low-wage countries in Asia and Latin America. The truth is that a lot of work has been lost to automation. U.S. manufacturers have become a lot more productive and simply don't need as many workers as they once did, Bown says. \"It's a lot more robots and computer equipment and many, many fewer people,\" Bown says. \"So what you see is, there still is, even today, a lot of manufacturing activity in the United States. It's just done with many, many fewer workers.\"",

According to the Clintons' 2015 tax returns, the couple earned $3.1 million from book advances and royalties. Donald Trump has described himself as \"really rich\" \u2014 but by just about any standard, that label fits both the Republican presidential nominee and his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton. In an election year characterized by populist energy over economic concerns like jobs and trade, the gap is striking. Clinton's newly released tax returns show that she and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, made more than $10 million in 2015. Trump is under pressure to follow suit, but he has yet to release his returns. He says he's a multi-billionaire, but his refusal to release the documents has led to speculation that Trump may not be as rich as he claims. What's clear is that both Trump and Clinton earn vastly more than the income of the typical American household, around $54,000 per year. So it's no surprise the candidates have been trying \u2014 and sometimes struggling \u2014 to connect with average voters.

Trump announced he would run with his own money. Money has been a big theme in this election. Trump often touts his wealth as evidence of his competence and success, promising to create jobs for working people. He's argued that his wealth means he won't answer to big donors \u2014 even though he has begun fundraising more aggressively since locking up the GOP nomination. \"I don't need anybody's money. I'm using my own money. I'm not using the lobbyists. I'm not using the donors. I don't care,\" Trump said during his campaign announcement speech at Trump Tower in New York last year. Humble beginnings Clinton, meanwhile, points to her middle-class, Midwestern roots. In her speech to the Democratic National Convention last month. Clinton said in the Rodham family, \"no one had their name on big buildings. My family were builders of a different kind.\" Clinton talked about her grandfather working to build a better life by working in a lace mill in Scranton, Pa., and her father's experience running a small business. Of course, Clinton grew up in an upper-middle class suburb of Chicago, and her father did well as the owner of a drapery business. Trump, too, has tried to demonstrate that he understands the lives of regular people. Speaking to the National Association of Home Builders in Miami Thursday, Trump reminisced about his father \u2014 also a builder \u2014 touring some of his construction sites. \"My father would go, and he'd pick up the sawdust, and he'd pick up the nails \u2013 the extra nails. And he'd pick up the scraps of wood; he'd use whatever he could use, and recycle it in some form, or sell it. And it was a constant process,\" Trump said. \"And he did a beautiful job.\" At a campaign rally in Erie, Pennsylvania, he said he actually prefers the workers on construction sites to his wealthy peers: \"They say, you know, you're really rich. How come you sort of relate to these people? Well, you know, my father built houses and I used to work in these houses,\" Trump said. \"I got to know the plumbers, the steamfitters, I got to know them all. And I liked them better than the rich people that I know. I know a lot of rich people. It's true. They are better. I like them better.\" Too rich? While Trump touts his ability to accumulate vast wealth in the real-estate business, Clinton has come under fire for the amount of money she and her husband have made since leaving public office. In June of 2014, ABC's Diane Sawyer asked about her lucrative paid speeches to audiences that have included Wall Street firms. \"We came out of the White House not only dead broke, but in debt. We had no money when we got there, and we struggled to, you know, piece together the resources for mortgages, for houses, for Chelsea's education,\" Clinton said. \"You know, it was not easy.\" That answer was widely panned by Clinton's critics and rated \"mostly false\" by Politifact. Authentic versus on script Republican pollster Frank Luntz says he's no fan of either Clinton OR Trump, but he says Clinton's carefully rehearsed style feels inauthentic to many working-class voters. \"To working-class voters, they want you to let loose,\" Luntz told NPR. \"They want you to say what you mean and mean what you say.\" Despite Trump's massive wealth, his \"willingness to say just about anything to just about anyone at any time\" has strengthened his credibility, Luntz said, with working-class people who are \"tired of being talked down to.\" But Luntz added that Trump's slipping poll numbers over the past few weeks suggest his style may be turning off the upper middle-class voters the Republican Party has long relied upon.",

            "article_content": "Last year, according to census data, more people moved to the South than any other region in the U.S. Those demographic changes are also affecting the 2016 presidential race, especially in states like Georgia and North Carolina.  AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: One of the big questions about this presidential election is whether Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton could create a new electoral map. Demographic changes in Southern states like Georgia and North Carolina and in Rust Belt states like Ohio could change the way these states fall politically. NPR's Asma Khalid covers the intersection of demographics and politics. She's here in the studio. Hey there, Asma. ASMA KHALID, BYLINE: Hey, Audie. CORNISH: Now, I hear the term New South being used now in a very different way, right? How does it apply to this new map? KHALID: So in my mind, the New South is really an economic term, and it describes states like Georgia and North Carolina. These are two states where the population has exploded in the last few decades. And a lot of this growth is because both of these states have urban centers with a lot of diverse career opportunities. Both North Carolina and Georgia are attracting younger people, more educated folks and more people of color. And in fact, if you look at census data, you'll see that more people moved to the South than any other region of the country last year. CORNISH: So Georgia in North Carolina - popular places to move. Are they in play politically? KHALID: So yes, I would say that they potentially are in play. And that's partly because the people that are moving to the area are - a lot of them are from New England, the Midwest and New York in particular. And when they're moving, they're bringing, you know, a different cultural attitude. There's this one town in North Carolina called Cary - C-A-R-Y. And the joke there is that it's nicknamed Containment Area For Relocated Yankees - you know, college-educated folks moving to the South for jobs. I spoke with Rebecca Tippet. She's the director of Carolina Demography. It's this research firm based at UNC Chapel Hill. And she told me that all of these new people are also bringing new political attitudes. REBECCA TIPPET: I've heard somebody joke that, you know, Republicans from New England come down and realize that they're actually a Democrat in North Carolina. TIPPET: And Tippet also pointed out that there are a number of African-Americans coming back to the South. You know, if you look at the years after the civil rights movement - '60s and '70s - you actually had a lot of African-Americans who were born in North Carolina who were living up in states like New York. And now you have some of those people's kids and grandkids who are moving back to North Carolina. So all of this is to say the groups moving to North Carolina and Georgia seem more likely to vote Democrat. CORNISH: You also mentioned college degrees earlier. Talk about how that's affecting things. KHALID: So when you look at census data, you'll see that more people with a bachelor's degree moved to the South than any other region of the country last year. Recently, you know, we've seen a few polls that suggest Hillary Clinton may have a lead in Georgia, and that's largely because of the white, college-educated population, particularly white women who seem to be leaning toward Clinton. The other thing to keep in mind is that some of the Southern states like Georgia are places where white voters chose John McCain over Barack Obama by 50 points in 2008. So Clinton just has a lot more room to grow in that area. That's not necessarily the case in some of the Midwest industrial states. CORNISH: So talk a little bit more about those industrial states. We always hear come election time about Ohio and Pennsylvania. What are you actually seeing there that could indicate a shift in presidential politics? KHALID: Well, those states have voted Democrat the last few election cycles, but when you look at a map of migration patterns in the last half century, it's mind-boggling. About three quarters of people living in Ohio today were born there. In fact, last year the Midwest actually lost more people than any other region. They just left. Ohio and Pennsylvania are actually experiencing some of the exact opposite trends that we're seeing in the South. The economy is not as robust, and there aren't as many job options. There's also a large white, working-class population in both of these states, and that's why we're seeing Trump make a play for those populations - you know, places where issues like trade and trade deals resonate. But you know, whether this is a one-off election cycle or the beginning of a new map - I think it's hard to say. But what I can tell you, Audie, is that these demographic trends - they do not seem to be reversing. CORNISH: That's NPR's Asma Khalid. Thanks so much. KHALID: You're welcome.

One of the first stops for both candidates: the battleground state of Ohio.  RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: Presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump have hit the campaign trail. Trump is in Ohio scheduled to hold a town hall in Columbus later today. Meanwhile, Clinton is on her way out of that swing state. She's headed to Nebraska after a weekend bus tour that took her more than 500 miles from Hatfield, Pa. on Friday evening, stopping along the way until she reached Columbus, Ohio last night. And that's where we're catching up with NPR's Tamara Keith. Good morning. TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Good morning. MONTAGNE: Now, no surprise that she's there. Ohio is a target for both presidential campaigns. In fact, it's a key state every year, right? KEITH: Every election year, certainly. It's sort of the ultimate American swing state. And Donald Trump's general election strategy runs right through Pennsylvania and Ohio and counts on the white working-class voters in both of those states. And so Hillary Clinton and her running mate Tim Kaine rode their bright blue buses right through what has become Donald Trump country into parts of Pennsylvania and Ohio where his message resonates. And here's Clinton at one of the stops. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) HILLARY CLINTON: We are visiting places that prove what Americans can do. KEITH: This was Clinton at Johnstown Wire Technologies in a county where the population is overwhelmingly white and where Mitt Romney won in 2012. Stop after stop, Clinton outlined her job creation plan, which includes a big investment in infrastructure and supporting small businesses. When the buses pulled into Youngstown, Ohio Saturday night, it was well after 10 p.m. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CLINTON: As you can tell, I'm pretty excited. It may be late, but I'm really jazzed up about what we're going to do. (APPLAUSE) CLINTON: And I don't think the stakes could be higher. KEITH: The message from Clinton, in short, she has plans. Trump has talk. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CLINTON: He talks about putting America first, right? Well, then why does he make Trump suits in Mexico instead of Brooklyn, Ohio? (APPLAUSE) CLINTON: Why does he make furniture in Turkey instead of Cleveland? KEITH: Youngstown, where Clinton spoke, used to be a solidly Democratic town. But over the decades, it's been hard hit by a decline in manufacturing. Rick Clark and Jim Green came to see Clinton and Kaine. RICK CLARK: Unfortunately, there are folks in this town that really believe that the '50s, the '60s and the '70s are going to come back. And... JIM GREEN: They're just not. We just have to move forward. And it's built up a lot of anger. And it's sort of scary. KEITH: They both plan to vote for Clinton. But Clark says they have friends and acquaintances who are sold on Trump. And there's probably not much Clinton could do to change their minds. CLARK: The fear that we have is that their anger is so deep that they won't even listen to something like this. KEITH: Polls show Clinton losing non-college-educated white men by huge margins. But her campaign isn't ready to cede that ground just yet. That's what the bus tour was all about, going into less-than-friendly territory with the hopes of cutting into Trump's support in states he has to win if he's going to have a chance in November. MONTAGNE: And, of course, Tamara, at the heart of this campaign, as you're just saying, is the economy and jobs. But that issue is not eating up headlines like the string of controversies that Donald Trump has been unschooling for months. And this past weekend, it was all about the Khan family. KEITH: Yeah, that's right. Hillary Clinton was probably the only person in the political world talking about the economy this weekend. This has been a multi-day controversy for Donald Trump. It all started when Khizr Khan spoke at the Democratic Convention. He's the father of a fallen Muslim American soldier, a hero, killed in Iraq. And he was critical of Donald Trump. Then over the weekend in interviews and tweets, Trump punched back. But the negative reaction was swift because you basically have a presidential candidate going after a Gold Star Family. And Khan didn't back down this weekend either. Here he was on CNN. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KHIZR KHAN: I want his family to counsel him. Teach him some empathy. He will be a better person if he could become. But he is a black soul. And this is totally unfit for the leadership of this beautiful country. KEITH: Late yesterday, Trump's running mate put out a statement seemingly trying to clean up some of Trump's remarks. And Mike Pence said all Gold Star Families should be cherished. MONTAGNE: That's NPR's Tamara Keith on the campaign trail in Columbus, Ohio. Thanks very much. KEITH: You're welcome. MONTAGNE: And Donald Trump has continued to speak out about the Muslim parents of a fallen American soldier. This morning, he tweeted, and I'm quoting, \"this story is not about Mr. Khan, who is all over the place doing interviews, but rather radical Islamic terrorism and the U.S. Get smart,\" exclamation mark.

            "article_content": "Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine are campaigning in Pennsylvania and Ohio, talking about the economy. But Donald Trump and the Khan family have dominated the media over the weekend.  MICHEL MARTIN, HOST: Hillary Clinton is wrapping up what's called a barnstorming tour this evening. She and her running mate Virginia Senator Tim Kaine took buses through the Rust Belt this weekend trying to sell their economic message and their team to blue-collar voters in a couple of key states. And yet, much of the political conversation this weekend is about the Khan family and Donald Trump. NPR's Tamara Keith is following the Clinton campaign on the bus tour this evening, and she's with us now. She's actually on the bus. Hi, Tam. TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Hi. I am definitely on a moving bus right now (laughter). MARTIN: So the back and forth between Donald Trump and the Khan family - we heard about this at the top of the program, but for listeners who maybe didn't hear that, could you give us a quick sketch? KEITH: There was this powerful moment at the convention where Mr. Khan pulled out his pocket Constitution and offered it to Donald Trump. Trump was asked about this in an interview on ABC's \"This Week,\" and he questioned whether that speech had been written by the Clinton campaign, which Mr. Khan said it was not. He questioned why Mrs. Khan didn't speak. She had in another interview said, well, actually I didn't speak because I was way too emotional. Just seeing her son's picture causes her to be upset, even all these years after he was killed in Iraq. Then Donald Trump tweeted out this morning, quote, \"I was viciously attacked by Mr. Khan at the Democratic convention. Am I not allowed to respond? Hillary voted for the Iraq War not me.\" Now, Hillary Clinton has also weighed in. She held a quick media availability at a place called Grandpa's Cheesebarn along the bus route here. And she was very critical of Trump, said this comes in a long line of other people or groups of people that Donald Trump has criticized. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) HILLARY CLINTON: Any one of those things is so offensive. And then to launch an attack as he did on Captain Khan's mother, a gold star mother, who stood there on that stage with her husband honoring the sacrifice of their son and who has in the days since spoken out about the overwhelming emotion that any mother would feel as her son was being honored and then to have Trump do what he did - I don't know where the bounds are. I don't know where the bottom is. MARTIN: Tam, talk a little bit about where you've been over the last couple of days. Where did this campaign take the bus tour and what is the message that they're trying to sell there? KEITH: The bus tour went through Donald Trump country, essentially. It went to parts of Pennsylvania and Ohio with a large population of white working-class voters, which is exactly the voters that Donald Trump has appealed to in this campaign. And what the Clinton campaign is doing by going to those places is essentially saying that they are not at this point willing to cede those votes to Donald Trump. They believe that if people can hear their message that it will break through and that they could perhaps win those voters back. I did talk to one man at an event in Youngstown, Ohio, last night. He supports Clinton but he said a lot of his friends don't, that they're so angry about economic conditions and factory closures and other things that happened years ago that he doesn't think that they will listen to Clinton, that there's very little she could say to break through. MARTIN: Did the upcoming presidential debates come up as well over the course of those couple of days? KEITH: Yes. Donald Trump has tweeted out that he's concerned about a conflict between the NFL football schedule and the presidential debate schedule. We asked Hillary Clinton about that today. She said that the debate schedule was set long ago by a nonpartisan commission, and she has every intention of attending those debates. MARTIN: That's NPR's Tamara Keith on the bus with the Clinton campaign currently in Ohio. Tam, thanks so much. KEITH: You're welcome so much. Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

The third night of the 2016 Democratic convention scaled several major peaks: President Obama gave, perhaps, the best-written oration of his career. Vice President Joe Biden gave, perhaps, his last national convention address, and his prospective successor, Tim Kaine, gave his first. But when it was all over, and Obama was joined on stage by the woman who wants to succeed him, you could feel the love welling up from the delegates and you could sense the doubt hanging over them \u2014 an invisible cloud casting a psychological shadow. Yes, the crowd had been wowed by Michelle Obama and Elizabeth Warren and the \"Comeback Kid\" himself, Bill Clinton. But would Hillary Clinton herself be able to seal the deal on the last night? Never known as a big-venue speechmaker, Clinton will face a make-or-break moment with multiple pitfalls, varying objectives and a variety of critical audiences. For starters, she needs to overcome her reputation for being overly intense and humorless in her public presentations. Beyond that, she needs to reassure those who doubt her integrity after many months of pounding from conservatives and media organizations on Benghazi and on her private email server. Alabama delegates cheer during the convention on Thursday.\n                \n                    \n                    Matt Rourke/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Alabama delegates cheer during the convention on Thursday. She needs to reassure those who have been told that a woman (or at least this particular woman) is not equal to the task of national security in a time of foreign crisis and domestic threats. And she needs to convince members of her own party that she shares their sensibilities as expressed in the party platform, widely regarded as the \"most progressive in party history.\" And as she speaks, she will likely face a crossfire from the still-restive ranks of die-hard Bernie Sanders delegates. Although they have not been as constantly disruptive as they were on Monday afternoon, pockets of unity-resistant Sandersistas have distracted from the convention program here and there. They chanted \"stop\" when a former admiral spoke, and they kept up a steady stream of noise when Leon Panetta, former secretary of defense and CIA director, was on stage. At another point they chanted \"no more war\" until the rest of the convention drowned them out with \"USA.\" This tended to undercut the message the convention organizers had tried to convey on Wednesday night \u2014 a message of Democrats being sure-handed and resolute on national security. Panetta, in particular, recast his remarks after hearing Republican nominee Donald Trump on Wednesday call for Russian hackers to look for old State Department emails Clinton was said to have deleted. Trump suggested this would be a field day for the media. Panetta wanted to point out this amounted to urging \"an adversary\" to go fishing in important pools of potentially classified information. (Trump later backed off the call, saying he was just being sarcastic.) The Sanders contingent includes many peace activists and people for whom Obama and Clinton and Panetta are guilty of continuing George W. Bush's \"war on terror.\" The fact that they wound down the war in Iraq gradually and actually extended the war in Afghanistan makes them unacceptable. These protesters are akin to the anti-war activists of the Vietnam era who cared more about defeating the hawks in the Democratic Party than about defeating the Republican Party, which ultimately proved at least equally hawkish, if not more so. These holdouts remained unmoved by Clinton winning the roll call vote on Tuesday by nearly a thousand votes, or by her receiving Sanders' endorsement. Instead, they see the entire system as rigged and regard the leaked batch of DNC emails as proof the entire process was corrupt, even the primaries and caucuses, which were actually run by the individual states or state parties. They are not dissuaded by the fact that Sanders did win nearly two-dozen states. So Clinton will need a strategy for dealing with some kind of pushback from this contingent when she rises to accept the party nomination Thursday night. But there could be an even larger issue looming over her campaign and its communication with voters. Hillary Clinton needs to connect with ordinary people, especially Anglo white people over 30 who do not have a college education. Polls show this group is trending to Trump by roughly 2 to 1. As powerful as Obama was on Wednesday, he probably did not break through to this group, which did not feel his magnetism in 2008 or 2012 and provided much of the voting muscle for his midterm humiliations in 2010 and 2014. Vice President Joe Biden and his wife, Jill, wave to the crowd at the Democratic National Convention.\n                \n                    \n                    Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Vice President Joe Biden and his wife, Jill, wave to the crowd at the Democratic National Convention. Hillary Clinton generally ran ahead of Obama with these voters in 2008, powering her primary wins then in Ohio, Pennsylvania, West Virginia and elsewhere. But when the opponent is a Republican, and specifically Trump, she does not match up well. Among the speakers on Wednesday night, Biden's voice was the one most attuned to the ears of this voting group. The son of Irish Catholic working people in Scranton, Pa., Biden moved to neighboring Delaware and began his political career there. His speeches still appeal to regular folks quite directly, often with terms such as \"malarkey\" and a tendency to unbridled enthusiasm. In this, Biden has offered balance for Obama's often cerebral and even lecture-like speeches. But others on the podium also suggested models for breaking through to those who do not watch C-SPAN or spend time with political newsprint. Kaine stressed his working-class roots (his father had a metalworking business) and flashed a style of enthusiasm and outreach reminiscent of Biden's own. Michael Bloomberg, a billionaire several times over before he served three terms as mayor of New York, found plain terms to convey his feelings in his brief remarks. While others this week have droned on in critique of Trump's business persona, Bloomberg was brief: \"I'm a New Yorker, and I know a con when I see one.\" Bloomberg also cut through some fog when he called Clinton the \"sane and competent\" candidate for president this fall. No one missed the contrast implied. Another example of connecting in a few words was Martin O'Malley, the former governor of Maryland and a presidential candidate for several months last winter. O'Malley motored through a brief address to the delegates in his shirtsleeves with necktie loosened and collar open. O'Malley hit his job-oriented issues fast and hard, keeping his voice high but under control, smiling a lot and using his hands. He left the stage to a sudden and surprise standing ovation. Asked later if his casual look had been a last-minute inspiration, O'Malley compared it to campaigning tieless in Iowa and New Hampshire. But of all the scores of speakers who have taken the podium this week, the one who might have been the best template for communicating with ordinary voters was Joe Sweeney, who served 21 years as a New York policeman and detective. Sweeney rushed to the World Trade Center site on Sept. 11, 2001, digging for survivors. Later, he and other rescuers learned the air they breathed that day had been toxic. On Tuesday night, Sweeney told the story of Clinton, then a senator, turning the Environmental Protection Agency around on that issue and getting help for people who got sick. \"A lot of people moved on,\" Sweeney testified. \"They thought everything was fine. But Hillary Clinton kept in touch and kept at it. Ten years later, Hillary Clinton was still our toughest champion, making sure we still got our health benefits.\" \"Still Our Toughest Champion\" might make a kind of motto, if a person were running for something. It is exactly the kind of brief, sharp and intelligible message too often lacking in politics, or at least in presidential politics on the Democratic side. It may not be possible for every candidate to be pithy, pointed and able to draw blood with the use of the language. But someone who wants to be president should explore and understand how language is used, and how it will be used against them. A historic example will be on stage in Philadelphia on Thursday night in the 10 o'clock hour.",

On Monday night, the Democratic National Convention featured speeches from a string of labor leaders. They spoke for different constituencies \u2014 teachers, public sector workers, builders \u2014 but together they delivered their unifying message: Clinton, not Trump, is the best candidate for American workers. \"He thinks he's a tough guy. Well, Donald, I worked in the mines with tough guys,\" said Richard Trumka, president of the AFL-CIO. \"I know tough guys. They're friends of mine. And Donald, you're no tough guy; you're a phony.\" Speaker after speaker blasted Trump on behalf of workers. Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon summed up the message by depicting Trump as predatory: \"He is no more a champion for American workers than a lion is a champion for a gazelle.\" Onetime rival Bernie Sanders also pumped up Clinton's record with workers. \"Hillary Clinton understands that if someone in America works 40 hours a week, that person should not be living in poverty. She understands that we must raise the minimum wage to a living wage. And she is determined to create millions of new jobs,\" he said. Trump is particularly strong among the white, blue-collar subset of workers, and his opponents know it. \"He starts from a baseline of support among white working-class voters particularly. That is an important thing that we have to recognize,\" said Matt Morrison, deputy director of Working America, an AFL-CIO-affiliated group that does outreach among workers who are not union-represented. The Democrats' appeals countered a Republican convention that painted Donald Trump as a champion of the working class. In his acceptance speech, Trump talked about reaching out to laid-off workers and saving jobs by negotiating trade deals. Silicon Valley entrepreneur Peter Thiel referred to Trump as a \"blue-collar billionaire.\" And Donald Trump Jr.'s remarks described a real estate mogul with a down-to-earth sensibility, seeing potential in workers whose resumes \"don't include the names of fancy colleges and degrees.\" He later said that he and his siblings \"didn't learn from M.B.A.'s; we learned from people who had doctorates in common sense.\" Those appeals may have helped deliver Trump's post-RNC polling bounce. Trump made huge gains among white voters without a college degree after the RNC. Before that, he had led among that group by 20 points, according to CNN polling. Now, he leads by 39 points. During the Republican convention, Trump also tried to extend his message beyond his white-working-class base, for example by mentioning unemployment figures for African-Americans and Latinos. To gain more workers' favor, Morrison said, Democrats will this week have to convince disaffected voters that government can still solve problems. \"I think at this point, folks have just heard it all, seen it all,\" Morrison added. \"Voters are fed up and feeling like the system isn't connecting to their real-life needs.\" Of course, with an opponent who has such high unfavorables (with Clinton close behind), going on the attack can't hurt. While Trump runs on his business record, groups supporting Clinton are weaponizing it. Monday night, AFSCME President Lee Saunders invoked a dispute in Las Vegas where Trump managers fought food and drink service workers' attempts to unionize. \"Donald Trump wants to tear working people down. He's only in business for himself,\" Saunders said. It's nothing new for the economy to be a major campaign topic. However, speaking to Americans' frustrations on a personal level perhaps takes on extra importance as many voters hear about a recovering economy but don't feel many of its effects. And so November is shaping up to be a battle over which party convinces voters that it can help struggling workers struggle a little less. At a Monday RNC news conference, former Pennsylvania senator (and former Trump nomination rival) Rick Santorum predicted that some Democrats would defect to support Trump, as he cares about \"average workers in America.\" \"That used to be the Democratic Party. That used to be their message,\" he said. One union representative, meanwhile, cast that messaging as deceptive. \"The working families are not going to be won over or hoodwinked,\" said Thomas Ritchie, who works for AFSCME in Ohio, from his seat at the convention on Monday night. Asked if he thought Trump's rhetoric would persuade his union members to vote Republican in November, he responded, \"I don't think so. I think that our people are too smart for that.\"",

There is a well-worn piece of advice among political campaign professionals: When your opponent is committing suicide, don't get in the way. In this age of Twitter and Facebook, we should add a quick corollary: Do not make news that interrupts the reporting of your opponent's problems \u2014 even momentarily. This would be a time when these wisdoms, old and new, might be retweeted to the leaders of the Democratic Party. Over the weekend, as their convention delegates converged on Philadelphia, the Democrats found themselves in a crossfire about their national committee and its chairperson \u2014 Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a member of Congress from Florida. Democrats had been banking on the weekend campaign news being dominated by newly named running mate Tim Kaine \u2014 buttressed by the endorsement of Hillary Clinton by her primary rival Bernie Sanders and by potential third-party challenger Mike Bloomberg. Finally, many party operatives felt, the big wheels of Hillary Clinton's juggernaut would mesh and roll forward together. But it was not to be so. Yet another story about emails, this time within the Democratic National Committee staff, emerged to steal the storyline. It had been easy for Democratic true believers to exult in the story of last week's Republican nominating event in Cleveland. The Republicans' pitch had been diminished at times by their scenes of disunity and by intraparty statements critical of their nominee. Reinforcing this impression was the stunning set of subsequent outbursts \u2014 both extraordinary and petty \u2014 from Donald Trump, the GOP's freshly minted nominee. Rarely if ever has a candidate taken to the instantaneous media so eagerly \u2014 with the unintended effect of undercutting the positive messaging from his own nomination convention. After his high-impact acceptance speech provided a strong finish to the convention's final night, Trump hit the media relentlessly, pushing the boundaries of political decorum. Before 24 hours had passed, Trump had renewed his highly personal denunciations of his last two GOP primary rivals (Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Ohio Gov. John Kasich) and passed the word that he might spend tens of millions of dollars to destroy them in their home states. These pronouncements came on the heels of an interview, released in the midst of the convention, in which Trump vowed to cut NATO allies loose in a confrontation with Russia if they had not paid up their NATO bills fully and on time. Such a bold statement might have sunk a presidential candidate in either party in any of the past few decades. And while its lasting damage has yet to be assessed, it has dismayed not a few Republican stalwarts both in and out of elected positions. Yet Trump was clearly proud of himself for doubling down on his concept of an \"America First\" foreign policy. In the minds of Clinton's campaign team, Trump's convention and subsequent media behavior represented a gift \u2014 a political opening for the Democrats to appeal to centrist independents and even to Republicans. Responding to this opportunity, the Clinton campaign at first pivoted in exemplary fashion. After maintaining a steady barrage of responses to Trump's attacks and assertions during the convention in Cleveland, the Clinton forces rolled out Kaine, a relatively noncontroversial running mate, in relatively noncontroversial fashion. Kaine, a Virginia senator and a former governor and mayor, took the stage in Miami on Saturday speaking Spanish, but also speaking of moderation and traditional working-class values. He was a breath of fresh air who, at the same time, hearkened back to bipartisan values and cooperation. The 2016 cycle finally seemed to have a centering influence. But even as Clinton and Kaine executed their tandem turn on Saturday, a storm was brewing. WikiLeaks, the self-styled international sentinel of anti-secrecy, released 19,000 emails hacked from the servers of the Democratic National Committee. Most represented the \"entre nous\" conversations of middle-level staffers, but they served to confirm long-festering charges that the DNC was in the tank for Clinton all along. Sanders himself told TV interviewers he was anything but shocked. He said he had perceived the prejudice against him all along and that he had called repeatedly for the resignation of Wasserman Schultz \u2014 who actually did resign as national party chair Sunday, effective when the convention ends. And indeed, anyone with more than passing interest in the primaries would have divined signs of bias at the DNC at any juncture in the past year. Wasserman Schultz, an ambitious member of Congress from south Florida, often and openly called Clinton a friend. Moreover, the chair had often been at odds with the Sanders campaign. To be sure, Sanders was a registered Independent, an interloper in the party's presidential primary with little claim on the party's institutional resources. But his backers did not find that notion persuasive in the least. And a midwinter dust-up over access to the party's shared database of voter information was only the tip of a deeply frozen iceberg of mutual resentment. But now all of that is ice water over the dam. Sanders did far better than expected in the voting but still fell far short of a majority of the pledged delegates. Clinton won that majority, on the basis of votes, and padded it out with superdelegates (the party officials and elected officeholders who can vote as they see fit). Sanders wound up with a great case to make for his popularity, but a less than compelling case for a claim on the nomination. Despite all this history, many Sanders enthusiasts and Clinton detractors are seizing upon the WikiLeaks story as a kind of vindication \u2014 a confirmation that they were right all along. The system was rigged. Sanders on Monday night can be expected to massage the hurt feelings of his supporters, who will include roughly two delegates in five on the floor. He will talk of how much they have achieved, the message they have sent and the policy changes they have forced into the party platform. He will exhort them to carry the revolution on. But Sanders is also expected to reiterate a full-throated endorsement of Clinton, casting the November choice in the starkest terms possible. It is not clear whether he will address the WikiLeaks revelations, but his remarks on Sunday indicated he was neither surprised nor disturbed by what the leaked emails revealed. Wasserman Schultz, for her part, has already been defenestrated. She says she will gavel the convention to order and into adjournment, adding remarks about the stakes in this election. Will she? It is not yet clear she will or won't, but the end of her tenure as DNC chair is nigh. Donna Brazile, highly respected longtime ally of the Clintons, will serve out the election year in the job (and forgo her CNN and other contracts to do so). How big a blow is it to a party entering its convention to replace its committee chair? On the eve of the 1984 Democratic gathering in San Francisco, the campaign of nominee Walter Mondale told DNC Chair Charles Manatt it wanted to replace him. The new guy was a hero of the old Jimmy Carter administration named Bert Lance. Manatt resisted, the story leaked out, and soon the Mondale folks had to back off. Mondale went on to lose 49 states that year, but no one blamed the fracas over the DNC chair. There were too many other elements of that election that mattered more. And so it will likely be for 2016.",

Tim Kaine of Virginia greet the crowd during a campaign event on July 14 in Annandale, Va. Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine is Hillary Clinton's choice for her vice president, giving her a running mate with experience at all levels of government to round out the Democratic ticket. Clinton told supporters the news in a text message and a tweet on Friday evening just after 8 p.m. ET. According to a Clinton campaign official, the former secretary of state called Kaine this evening to make the formal offer. In recent days, Kaine had emerged as the favorite \u2014 albeit safe \u2014 pick for Clinton, over other finalists such as Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, Labor Secretary Tom Perez and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker. According to the Clinton campaign official, their vetting process first began back in April with more than two dozen potential running mates. Kaine and Clinton campaigned last week in Northern Virginia as a tryout of sorts, and Clinton walked away impressed and comfortable with him as a partner. The two met with aides and then one-on-one for a total of about 90 minutes that night. Last Saturday, Kaine and Clinton met together with their families for lunch at the Clintons' home in Chappaqua, N.Y. She remained comfortable with Kaine as someone who could do the job, and the alliance was made. Kaine's addition to the ticket gives her a loyal ally who can help reach out to the Hispanic community and possibly woo disaffected independents or even some moderate Republicans turned off by Republican nominee Donald Trump. He is a low-risk pick, comes from a swing state that has become increasingly crucial in presidential elections, has a reputation as a moderate who works across the aisle, and doesn't overshadow the top of the ticket. In fact, in an interview last month on NBC's Meet the Press, Kaine even admitted, \"I am boring.\" Kaine was a finalist eight years ago in President Obama's vice presidential search, and he had endorsed the then-Illinois senator early on. This time, he joined the \"Ready for Hillary\" bandwagon before she even announced. The 58-year-old is a former housing lawyer who took off time from law school to work with Jesuit missionaries in Honduras, during which he became fluent in Spanish. Kaine got his start in politics on the Richmond City Council and later became the mayor of the Virginia capital. In 2001, he was elected the commonwealth's lieutenant governor. In 2005, he won a hard-fought race against then-Republican Attorney General Jerry Kilgore, helped by strong margins in the Northern Virginia suburbs and exurbs. His father-in-law is also a former Virginia governor. Kaine's tenure as governor (Virginia is the last state that still limits its governors to a single four-year term) was marked by the deadly shooting at Virginia Tech in April 2007. He was praised for his response to the shootings, gathering a panel to investigate the school's response and push for more mental health reforms. He struggled as governor, though, as the recession hit in 2008, and he unsuccessfully tried to push through a tax hike to fund his budget proposals. He was an early supporter of President Obama in the 2008 primary over Clinton. After Obama won, he tapped Kaine to lead the Democratic National Committee, and Kaine served as both chairman and governor for a year \u2014 something that drew some criticism within the state. He was chairman of the DNC during the disastrous 2010 midterm elections for Democrats that saw them lose the House. And his time atop the party committee may have chipped away at some his moderate credentials. He left the DNC in 2011 but jumped back into politics in 2012 to run for the Senate. He easily defeated former Republican governor and Sen. George Allen. In the Senate, he has been praised for building relationships on both sides of the aisle, and he could help Clinton with her legislative priorities in Congress. Kaine sits on the Senate Foreign Relations and Armed Services committee and has been less hawkish than Clinton in some instances. He has said the Obama administration needed to get authorization from Congress to use force against ISIS, and he has been critical of Congress for not granting an Authorization for Use of Military Force. Some of his more centrist positions have upset some past supporters of Clinton's former rival Bernie Sanders, many of whom wanted her to make a more progressive pick. Kaine is a supporter of free trade deals, and as his vice presidential stock began to rise, many progressive groups voiced their displeasure. But, as other observers have noted, the Minnesota native, who was raised in Kansas City, Mo., could help Clinton appeal to one of her weakest demographic areas \u2014 white, working-class men in the Rust Belt, a group where Trump has an advantage.

Conventions give candidates a second chance to make a first impression, even candidates who have been covered by the media as obsessively as Donald Trump. The Republican convention in Cleveland gives Trump that chance. Here are six things to watch this week: 1. Will the Cleveland convention stick to a script? Successful conventions drive home a message relentlessly, with every speech, video and testimonial designed to highlight the strengths of the candidate and minimize his weaknesses. Trump has shown that he is allergic to this kind of discipline. Even the rollout of his vice presidential pick was shambolic and off message. Reince Priebus, the Republican National Committee chairman, told the Washington Post that one goal of the convention is to make Trump more \"likable.\" After all, electing a president is more about \"Like\" Q than IQ. Trump has promised to add some \"showbiz\" to what he says is the usual boring convention formula. He'll have a lot of eyeballs this week. Most analysts predict record audiences, and viewers are expecting something pretty fantastic from the king of reality TV. A boring convention packed with B-list celebrities could drive voters away, or motivate Trump to do or say something even more outrageous to keep their attention. 2. Does Trump expand his message? Trump has shown time and time again that he's more comfortable with a spontaneous stream of consciousness rant than reading a speech from a teleprompter. And he's been phenomenally successful at capturing the emotions of people upset about a way of life they feel is being eroded by wage stagnation, demographic change and terrorist attacks. The convention gives him a chance to lay out an actual agenda, to explain with specificity what he would do to improve their lives. The Trump campaign sees its path to the White House running through the Rust Belt \u2014 boosting turnout of white-working class men to historic levels. But the message for those voters may clash with what Trump needs to do to attract swing-state voters, suburban women and minorities. The convention will give us a good idea of whether Trump feels he has to modify his message to reach both his base and beyond \u2014 or not. 3. Breakout stars? Conventions can give a rising star a chance to break out. That's what happened in 2004 when Barack Obama electrified the Democratic convention in Boston. The absence of so many leading Republicans in Cleveland may give others a chance to shine. We're watching to see if there is a 2004 Obama in the GOP lineup \u2014 maybe Ivanka Trump? Tom Cotton, the Arkansas senator? Pro-golfer Natalie Gulbis? 4. Will Mrs. Trump connect? Wives are the best validators a candidate has. They can humanize a politician \u2014 the way Ann Romney and Michelle Obama both did in 2012. Melania Trump, with her unusual background as a supermodel, could come across as affecting or too exotic. 5. Unity \u2014 will it happen or not? \"Never Trump\" is nevermore, but there is still less enthusiasm about the nominee than at any modern presidential convention. Trump himself has been ambivalent about whether he really needs a unified party, but he has acknowledged that he doesn't have it yet. And he has admitted that party unity was the reason he chose Mike Pence as his running mate. Polls show that Trump is getting the support of only about three-quarters of Republicans, a very low number. Conventions are often derided as four-day infomercials, but they serve an important purpose \u2014 getting an entire political party fired up behind the nominee. Will Cleveland do that for Trump? 6. Will Trump get a bump? The average convention poll bounce for Democrats since 1964 is 6.8 percent; for Republicans, it has been 5.3 percent, according to Gallup. Sometimes a candidate gets no bounce at all. Romney didn't in 2012. Trump is currently running a few points behind his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. Cleveland gives him a chance to close that gap.",

He is undecided which candidate he will vote for in the coming election, but does not like Trump, which sets him apart from most of the other drivers he talks to. This story from the Detroit suburbs is a part of A Nation Engaged, a series where NPR and several member stations are taking a look at battleground communities. Donald Trump is pinning his election hopes on a group of voters with long ties to the Democratic Party, but who've been known to abandon that loyalty \u2014 from time to time \u2014 to vote Republican. We're talking working-class white men, especially union members, the Reagan Democrats of the 1980s. With these voters, it's clear Hillary Clinton still has work to do. I saw that when I visited one of their homes in Garden City, just west of Detroit. That's where, if you stop by Larry McCool's house, you'll be greeted by a trio of giant Rottweiler dogs. He tells me they're friendly and not to worry. Maxie and Azul, ages 12 and 2, are both rescue dogs, and Coco, who looks like a small bear is angling to play fetch with my microphone in the backyard. Union worker Larry McCool in his yard in Garden City, Michigan.\n                \n                    \n                    Don Gonyea/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Union worker Larry McCool in his yard in Garden City, Michigan. McCool is 54, a union carpenter. \"My neighbor on one side, he's a UAW worker,\" he told me. \"The neighbor over, here's a Teamster. You know, so it's basically auto industry and basically good union people.\" When the financial crisis hit here, these small single-family homes took a big hit, he says, losing more than half their value just like that. \"Everybody was upside down. I mean, it was terrible, because to go to work and see somebody's stuff sitting on their front lawn,\" McCool said. \"I remember one of the first ones I've seen. And I stopped on the side of the road. And the wind was blowing stuff around, and I asked the woman if she needed help. You know, she was being evicted, and you could tell all hope was lost.\" The area's coming back, he says, but slowly. McCool is voting for Hillary Clinton after being a Bernie Sanders supporter in the primaries. He says Trump is all ego. \"Here comes Caesar and boom, boom, boom,\" he said. \"You know, he's got his whole family with him and we're going to do this. And, I mean, we're not the Roman Empire where we're going to walk in and take things.\" McCool's support of Clinton puts him in line with his union and with the national AFL-CIO. But it's not hard to find dissenting opinions among the rank and file here. Take 44-year-old Jim Bell: \"None of them. That's who I like,\" he said of the candidates. \"I don't like any of them. They're a joke.\" Bell works in nearby Dearborn. He's a Ford employee represented by the United Auto Workers Union. Politically, he says he's an independent. \"I'm undecided. However, I lean more towards Trump just because I think the change that Obama wanted to bring \u2014 I think Trump will,\" he said. Bell does like what the billionaire candidate says about trade, including that American factories will come roaring back and that auto jobs will return from Mexico. But Trump has also said UAW members make too much money. Bell doesn't like that, nor does he like that so many Trump-branded products, like Trump ties and shirts, are manufactured overseas. \"Make America great again, but he's contradicting exactly his theme song for this campaign by buying everything over in China,\" Bell said. \"However, that is still better than shady Hillary.\" Bell's coworker, Kevin Eisbrenner, has been a Trump backer from the beginning. Both he and Bell say they do wish Trump would tone down the insults, but they like that he's not politically correct. \"I'm voting for the man, but do I think he's qualified as a politician? No,\" Eisbrenner told me. But, he says, there is one thing Trump does have going for him: \"He's a leader. And every good leader knows how to surround themselves with qualified people.\" Now to a coffee shop in Novi \u2014 in northwest suburban Detroit. Scott Klein, 55, is a long-haul truck driver and former Sanders supporter. He is also undecided, but he does not like Trump, which sets him apart from most of the other drivers he talks to. \"They say there's two kinds of truck drivers,\" Klein said. \"There are the ones that sit at the counter and there's the ones that sit at the table. I'm a counter guy.\" So he sits there. And the guys on the stools next to him ... \"Trump. Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump,\" Klein said, \"All of them. I don't understand it. But I do, in a way. What's happening out in Washington now isn't working today. The vehicle for blowing the system up is Mr. Trump.\" Make America great again, but he's contradicting exactly his theme song for this campaign by buying everything over in China... that is still better than shady Hillary. Union worker Jim Bell Klein says he's interested in Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson. He says it's all frustrating, though, because it shouldn't be that hard to get some basic things done in Washington. I asked what would make a difference in his life. \"I would like a life where every week... we make enough that the bills are paid and I can put some money away for retirement,\" he said, adding that he's not doing that now. In Monroe County, south of Detroit, the Ford plant closed almost 10 years ago. Chuck Brooks, 39, worked there. He was able to transfer to another Detroit-area factory, but says there are still worries about more jobs going to Mexico. He says he tells fellow workers that Trump with his tough talk on trade is not the answer. \"You've got to be careful what you wish for because it could backfire,\" Brooks said. Bernie Sanders won the Michigan Democratic primary with Brooks' support. Now he's for Clinton. He says Trump has no credibility on jobs and trade. But he points to another potent topic that Trump uses to lure union votes \u2014 guns. \"They're taking your guns. You know, I won't take your guns. We all need guns. Go out and buy a gun. You know, go protect yourself. No one's coming to your house and taking your guns,\" He said, describing the presumptive GOP nominee's message. Michigan as a state has gone Democratic in the last six presidential elections. Historically, union members tend to vote in line with the recommendation of their union leadership. Donald Trump is hoping that changes this year. He at least has the ear of these voters in suburban Detroit.",

Bernie Sanders, I-Vt Bernie Sanders and Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton appear together at Portsmouth, N.H. High School where Sanders endorsed Clinton for president of the United States. This post was updated at 2:38 pm The lingering chasm between presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and her chief primary rival was bridged Tuesday, with Sen. Bernie Sanders teaming up with Clinton at a campaign event, where he formally endorsed Clinton's bid for the White House. \"Secretary Clinton has won the Democratic nominating process, and I congratulate her for that,\" Sanders said. \"She will be the Democratic nominee for president and I intend to do everything I can to make certain she will be the next president of the United States. \"I have come here today not to talk about the past but to focus on the future. That future will be shaped more by what happens on Nov. 8 in voting booths across our nation than by any other event in the world. I have come here to make it as clear as possible as to why I am endorsing Hillary Clinton and why she must become our next president.\" A few of the signs at the Bernie/Hillary rally. Feels a bit like a wedding where the family is unsure. pic.twitter.com/WvCmKzeSnM The Sanders endorsement ends a lengthy \u2014 and awkward \u2014 period in which many were wondering if and how he would back Clinton. Five weeks ago, Clinton, the Democratic Party's presumptive nominee, became the first woman in American history to secure enough delegates to clinch the nomination to head the ticket of a major party. After thanking his supporters for helping him win contests in 22 states and nearly 1900 delegates during the primary \u2013 a feat Sanders said was \"far more than almost anyone thought we could win\" \u2013 he quickly shifted his focus on Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee. \"Secretary Clinton has won the democratic nominating process,\" says Sanders. Now a group of his vocal supporters are walking out. As someone shouts during Clinton speech, Sanders looks at the person and gestures with his hand as if to say not now. Sanders, whose remarks lasted nearly half an hour, praised Clinton as a champion who will fight to fix the economy, help make public college and university tuition more affordable for working class families, someone who will work towards energy solutions to stave off climate change. Sanders also said Clinton will work towards raising the federal minimum wage higher than $7.25 \u2013 which he called a \"starvation wage.\" \"But her opponent \u2013 Donald Trump \u2013 well, he has a very different view. He believes that states should have the right to lower the minimum wage or even abolish the concept of the minimum wage altogether,\" Sanders said. The Trump campaign was busy during the announcement sending a flurry of emails, including one titled \"Bernie Is Now Official Part Of A Rigged System.\" Just before the start of the event Trump tweeted: \"Bernie Sanders, who has lost most of his leverage, has totally sold out to Crooked Hillary Clinton. He will endorse her today - fans angry!\" Bernie Sanders, who has lost most of his leverage, has totally sold out to Crooked Hillary Clinton. He will endorse her today - fans angry! There was also a tweet of a video montage of Sanders' past statements criticizing Clinton. When Clinton addressed the Portsmouth, N.H. crowd, she thanked those who supported the Sanders campaign. She highlighted his campaign which \"energized and inspired a generation of young people\" and helped bring \"people off the sidelines and into the political process.\" She underscored Sanders' earlier remarks saying that this election is bigger than single candidate or one campaign. \"Now with your help, we are joining forces to defeat Donald Trump, win in November and yes, together, build a better future we can all believe in,\" Clinton said. At one point, as a nod to a popular refrain by Sanders on the campaign Clinton trail, Clinton told the crowd: \"We accept $27 donations too, you know.\" Clinton also took time highlight her push for developing national guidelines on the use of force for law enforcement agencies across the nation as well as more rigorous training on implicit bias. While she did not mention explicitly the memorial service for the police officers killed in Dallas being held just a few hours after her event ended, she did praise their valor of the officers to \"ran into the gunfire.\" \"That's the kind of courage and dedication our police and first responders show every single day,\" Clinton said. Before the event kicked off, NPR's Tamara Keith noted feuding chants of \"Hillary\" and \"Bernie\" coming from the crowd. There was also a younger Sanders supporter shouting \"Never Hillary,\" as well as mentions of the FBI investigation into Clinton's email server, while sitting next to older women supporting Clinton, who appeared to be getting increasingly tense. But Democrats now get a chance to turn the page on a contentious primary campaign and promote a party that is unified, just days before the Republicans are set to kick off their own convention in Cleveland next week. New Hampshire is a state Sanders won handily during the primary \u2014 by more than 20 points \u2014 and catapulted his bid for the nomination into a robust campaign that challenged Clinton longer than most had predicted. The win helped Sanders raise massive amounts of money, more than the Clinton juggernaut \u2014 $225 million to Clinton's $210 million through the end of May. Sanders also outspent Clinton by $23 million ($216 million to $193 million). Sanders rode a wave of massive rallies that filled college arenas, where he championed issues, like beating back Wall Street's influence and overcoming income equality, which energize the liberal wing of the Democratic base, especially young voters and white liberals. As NPR's Tamara Keith reported Monday, Democrats gathered in Orlando, Fla., this past weekend to hash out planks of the party's platform. It now includes pushing for tuition-free state college, a $15 minimum wage, limits on fracking and other items Sanders campaigned on. Since becoming the presumptive nominee, Clinton has campaigned alongside President Obama and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, both of whom are wildly popular among Democrats. She has also warned a Trump presidency would push the country in the wrong direction. In 2008, it took Clinton only four days to come out in support of Obama after their long primary battle. Sanders, by contrast, has held out about a month from the end of the primary season. Both Clinton and Sanders huddled in Washington last month, and NPR's Tamara Keith has reported that both camps have maintained continual contact since that meeting. Clinton's appearance alongside Sanders could do a lot to assuage his supporters who may remain on the fence about supporting her candidacy, especially among young voters. Democrats head to their party convention in Philadelphia, where Clinton will be formally nominated later this month.' Watch full event here:",

            "article_content": "Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders met Tuesday evening to try to start healing wounds from their long, bitter primary battle. The summit between the two came the same night Clinton won the final contest of the cycle, easily notching a 57-point victory over Sanders in the District of Columbia's Democratic primary. A week ago Clinton clinched enough delegates to become her party's presumptive nominee, thanks to a mix of pledged delegates and superdelegates, though she won a large majority of pledged delegates and beat Sanders in the popular vote by more than 3 million votes. Nonetheless, Sanders has soldiered on, even after a loss last week in California, and has given no indication he intends to step aside and endorse Clinton anytime soon. That's a troubling sign to many in the party who want a united front against presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump sooner rather than later. A Clinton campaign official said that the 90-minute-long meeting at the Capital Hilton was a \"positive discussion about their primary campaign,\" which may be the first encouraging step for Democrats as the two try to find some closure \u2014 or at least common ground \u2014 before next month's convention in Philadelphia. According to both the Clinton and Sanders campaigns, the two congratulated each other on their primary runs and talked about how they could unify the party against \"the dangerous threat that Donald Trump poses to our nation.\" \"The two discussed a variety of issues where they are seeking common ground: substantially raising the minimum wage; real campaign finance reform; making health care universal and accessible; making college affordable and reducing student debt,\" Sanders spokesman Michael Briggs said in a statement. \"Sanders and Clinton agreed to continue working to develop a progressive agenda that addresses the needs of working families and the middle class and adopting a progressive platform for the Democratic National Convention.\" Jane Sanders, the candidate's wife, also attended the meeting, along with his campaign manager Jeff Weaver. Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta and campaign manager Robby Mook were also present. Even though the primary in the nation's capital marked the official end of voting in the long race, Sanders' campaign has maintained he will take his fight all the way to next month's convention, and will try to woo superdelegates to his side. But Sanders also has reiterated in recent days that he will do whatever it takes to stop Trump from winning. The readout from Tuesday's meeting between the Democratic candidates underscores that. Sanders also announced he will address his supporters Thursday at 8:30 p.m. ET via livestream, where he may reveal more concrete next steps. Sanders wrote to supporters earlier on Tuesday that even after the voting is done, \"our political revolution continues,\" and that his primary campaign has \"sent the establishment a message they can't ignore: We won't settle for the status quo.\" At a press conference earlier on Tuesday, he called for DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz to be replaced, and for superdelegates to be taken out of the party's primary equation. In a statement from the Democratic National Committee after the D.C. results, Wasserman Schultz did not refer to Clinton as the party's presumptive nominee, simply saying that, \"At our convention in July, we're going to nominate a qualified, capable candidate who will build on the hard-won progress of the last seven years.\"",

            "article_content": "Now that Hillary Clinton has become the Democratic Party's presumptive nominee, NPR takes a moment to reflect on the campaign of her rival, Bernie Sanders.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: Hillary Clinton has secured her place in history. She is the first woman to lead a major party's quest for the presidency. Her Democratic rival Bernie Sanders has run an insurgent campaign. He's drawn thousands, and he says he's not yet out of the race. NPR's Sam Sanders has this look at the Vermont senator's journey. SAM SANDERS, BYLINE: Bernie Sanders announced his run for president in April of last year, and his first press conference as a candidate was a little underwhelming. (SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE) BERNIE SANDERS: OK. Thank you all very, very much - whoa - for being out here today. Let me just make a brief comment. S. SANDERS: He told journalists that he didn't have much time to talk about his run for president because he had to get back to his day job as U.S. senator. In fact, in the beginning, lots of Bernie's campaign staff were working for his campaign for free after they finished their day jobs. A month later in Vermont, Sanders had a bigger campaign rollout, and you could just start to hear the heart of Sanders' message. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) B. SANDERS: Today, with your support and the support of millions of people throughout our country, we begin a political revolution to transform our country economically, politically, socially and environmentally. (CHEERING) S. SANDERS: A mix of Occupy Wall Street themes of income inequality with a dash of anti-establishment and unapologetic progressive ideals. And then in Iowa, Sanders pulled off an upset. He virtually tied Hillary Clinton. She only won that state by .3 percent. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) B. SANDERS: That is why what Iowa has begun tonight is a political revolution. S. SANDERS: Sanders' campaign had gone from outsider to insurgent. WINNIE WONG: Bernie is not the movement. He's a part of the movement. S. SANDERS: Winnie Wong is a Wall Street activist, and she's the founder of People for Bernie. That's a group of activists who helped convince Sanders to run. I talked to her at a Bernie rally in San Francisco this week. Earlier, they tried to draft another U.S. senator - Elizabeth Warren. WONG: Ready for Warren came out of Occupy. People for Bernie came out of Ready for Warren. So that's the arch, right? But it was always a tactic. At every step, it was a tactic. It was strategic. S. SANDERS: Bernie Sanders is not a one-off. He is part of a progressive populist movement that had been building for years, from Zuccotti Park to Burlington, Vt., and almost to the White House, but there were roadblocks. Sanders lost a critical black vote to Clinton in South Carolina by almost 70 percent. He struggled to connect with minority voters. At a Sanders rally in Seattle, there was this. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: If you do not listen to her, your event will be shut down. (CHEERING) S. SANDERS: Black Lives Matter activists commandeered his mic and made him shut down his own event. Eventually, Sanders was able to win a majority of black and Latino youth votes in several contests, on top of lots of working-class whites, but that wasn't enough to shake Clinton's lead with women and older minority voters. As time went on, Clinton racked up a bigger lead, and Sanders was reluctant to attack his main rival. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) B. SANDERS: But I think the secretary is right. And that is that the American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn emails. (APPLAUSE) HILLARY CLINTON: Thank you. Me, too. Me, too. S. SANDERS: That's Sanders during a Democratic debate, refusing to go after Clinton over her use of a private email severed during her time as secretary of state. Eventually, Sanders did attack, hitting Clinton hard on things like her paid speeches to Wall Street. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) B. SANDERS: Now I kind of think if you get paid a couple hundred thousand dollars for a speech, it must be a great speech. I think we should release it and let the American people see what the transcript was. (APPLAUSE) S. SANDERS: But by then, Clinton's lead was just too big, even as Sanders often outraised Clinton with millions in small donations. Now Sanders is all but locked out of the nomination, and his story resembles that of another insurgent campaign. JESSE JACKSON: I have one eye on the campaign and one eye on the crusade. S. SANDERS: That's Reverend Jesse Jackson. He ran for president twice - in '84 and '88. That second run was big. He won 11 contests, and he happened to be endorsed by the likes of Bernie Sanders, then mayor of Burlington, Vt. Ultimately, Jackson came up short and had to leave the race, but he says it was still worth it. JACKSON: Americans are better because we expanded the tent and got more people involved. S. SANDERS: Sounds a bit like Sanders, huh? Jackson says now is the time for Sanders and Clinton to unite their separate factions of the party. JACKSON: It both wings are flapping, we're going to fly. But if one wing's flapping, one wing is dormant, we will lose. S. SANDERS: Winnie Wong with People for Bernie - she says it's important to look back and see just how much Bernie has changed the conversation. He helped make a movement like Occupy and an ideology like Democratic socialism mainstream. WONG: Forget about the 10 million who cast their vote for Democratic socialist. Think about the many more millions across this country who are talking about it probably right now. S. SANDERS: And Wong says that movement will continue. She says for all true activists, the idea that something has failed - it's just not a part of their language. Sam Sanders - no relation - NPR News, Culver City. Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.

            "article_content": "Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton appear to have split victories in the Oregon and Kentucky primaries Tuesday night. With all counties reporting in Kentucky, Clinton was leading Sanders by a narrow margin of 1,924 votes out of more than 450,000 cast. Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes told CNN that Clinton was the \"unofficial winner,\" but the Associated Press said the race was too close to call. Sanders had a more comfortable victory in Oregon, where he was leading Clinton by more 12 points with 95.5 percent of the vote reported as of Wednesday afternoon. De facto GOP nominee Donald Trump, the only remaining candidate, easily won the state's Republican primary. Ultimately, Tuesday's dueling victories did little to change the trajectory of the Democratic race. The two will end up splitting delegates in Kentucky, and Sanders will gain a handful more than Clinton in Oregon. But her delegate lead will still remain almost 280 pledged delegates \u2014 virtually impossible for Sanders to make up in the remaining six state contests. Speaking at a rally in California late Tuesday, Sanders was defiant that he would remain in the race despite the \"steep hill\" he faced. He said he was confident he would win the state's primary on June 7 and promised to \"fight for every vote\" until the District of Columbia's Democratic primary on June 14, and \"take our fight to the convention\" in July in Philadelphia. Clinton's apparent Kentucky win was her first primary victory since April; the Vermont senator recently notched wins in Indiana and West Virginia, but by margins that did little to close the gap with Clinton. Still, her repeated losses spurred talk that Clinton would have difficulty uniting Democrats in the fall, and also exposed her weaknesses with younger voters and white, working-class men. And it stalled her efforts to fully turn her attention to a likely general election matchup with Trump. That Bluegrass State victory is one Clinton fought hard for, campaigning heavily in the state. According to NBC News, it was the first state since March 15 where she outspent Sanders on the airwaves. Both the Kentucky and Oregon contests were closed primaries \u2014 meaning only registered Democrats \u2014 and not independents or crossover Republicans \u2014 could vote. Throughout the primaries, Clinton consistently has done better in such closed contests. Sanders did well in Kentucky's more rural areas \u2014 coal mining-heavy regions similar to those he captured last week in the West Virginia primary. Those are areas Clinton did well in versus Barack Obama in 2008, but since then she has come under fire for comments suggesting she would begin to phase out the industry in favor of cleaner energy sources. She also has become aligned with President Obama's unpopular environmental policies in the region. But Clinton did well enough in metro areas of the state like Lexington and Louisville to take the lead over Sanders. In Oregon, where votes were almost entirely cast by mail-in ballot, Sanders carried the state's progressive electorate and won by big margins in areas with college towns. Kentucky's 55 pledged delegates will be split proportionally, and such a close finish means Clinton and Sanders each will get roughly the same number \u2014 again, not really enough to change Clinton's advantage over Sanders. He still needs to win about 66 percent of all remaining pledged delegates to hold a majority of them; when superdelegates are included, that proportion climbs to around 84 percent. Sanders has remained in the race despite nearly insurmountable odds of reaching the 2,383 delegates needed to clinch the Democratic nomination. Tensions escalated between the campaigns and the national party on Tuesday as the Sanders campaign doubled down on charges it had been unfairly treated at this past weekend's Nevada Democratic convention. There were tense confrontations between Sanders delegates and Nevada party officials, and the state party chairwoman has said she since has received threats from Sanders supporters.",

Walk around a Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Railriders game talking to Donald Trump supporters, and you'll hear a whole bunch of different reasons people in Northeastern Pennsylvania are supporting him. Some Trump backers say they're worried about ISIS. Others say the economy is their top concern. But every person eventually returns to the same central quality he is most passionate about in the likely Republican nominee: the fact that he's not a typical politician. \"What a breath of fresh air,\" said Mike Zuby, who wore a \"Pennsylvania For Trump\" T-shirt to a recent game between the Triple-A Railriders and Pawtucket Red Sox. \"To be able to wake up and at least know that someone's out there \u2014 the average and ordinary-type guy. He's not just a billionaire; he's speaking with total unpolitical correctness. He's speaking exactly what we want to be saying to this big monster called Washington.\" People feel that Washington will never control him. Pa. Rep. Lou Barletta Republican Rep. Lou Barletta believes that outsider quality is what propelled Trump to a dominating win in Northeastern Pennsylvania last month. He represents the Scranton region in the House and was one of the first congressmen to endorse Trump. In Luzerne County, home of Wilkes-Barre, Trump won more than 77 percent of the vote. \"People feel that Washington will never control him. And that's what they want,\" Barletta said. The Trump campaign believes the road to the White House runs through places like Scranton. It's banking on reshaping the electoral map and carrying traditionally Democratic industrial states like Pennsylvania by riding a wave of working-class votes. Can Trump Change Pennsylvanians' Party Loyalty? Barletta thinks Trump can be the first Republican to win Pennsylvania since 1988, pointing to the fact that more than 60,000 Democrats switched their party registration to the GOP before this year's state primary. \"That's for Donald Trump,\" he said. \"They weren't doing that to vote for Ted Cruz or John Kasich.\" But winning Pennsylvania in November will be a very steep climb for Trump. The state has about 1 million more registered Democrats than Republicans. And while many of them stay home in other years, Pennsylvania Democrats typically show up en masse when there's a presidential race on the ballot. \"At the end of the day, I just don't think there's enough angry old white people in Pennsylvania to make up for the fact of what Trump is doing on the other side to motivate the Democratic base,\" said Christopher Nicholas, a longtime Pennsylvania Republican strategist who ran several campaigns for former Sen. Arlen Specter. \"I hope I'm wrong.\" \"In a statewide election in Pennsylvania, you have to worry about how many votes you come out of Philadelphia and Pittsburgh down,\" he said. \"Because at a certain point there's not enough votes in the rest of the state, in the other 65 counties, to make up for that. The math just doesn't work anymore.\" President Obama carried Philadelphia by about 492,000 votes in 2012, and ended up winning the state by about 309,000. In 2004, John Kerry topped President George W. Bush by 412,000 votes in Philadelphia. The wide margin offset Bush votes elsewhere, and Kerry ended up winning the state by about 144,000.

Play For Blue-Collar Democrats Former Gov. Ed Rendell, a Democrat with close ties to Hillary Clinton, is confident that fears about a Donald Trump presidency will turn out urban Democrats. \"You know, there's an old saying in politics that hate is a more powerful emotion than love,\" he said, \"or fear is a more powerful emotion than love. I think Donald Trump will produce the turnout.\" At the end of the day, I just don't think there's enough angry old white people in Pennsylvania. Christopher Nicholas, longtime Republican strategist Still, Rendell isn't dismissing Trump's play for blue-collar Democrats in Western and Central Pennsylvania. \"There's no question that they're part of the angry slice of America,\" he said. \"Many of them have lost their jobs because of manufacturing problems. Not just trade-related, but technology, related, etc. So I think he will be successful in taking some of those into his column.\" But Rendell thinks that Trump's outside-the-box antics will also turn off moderate Republican voters \u2014 particularly Republican women \u2014 in the populous suburban counties surrounding Philadelphia. \"I think he will wind up, my guess is, losing more of those type of Republicans than he gains in blue-collar Democrats,\" Rendell said. Indeed, Pennsylvania's most high-profile moderate Republican, former Gov. Tom Ridge, announced Tuesday that he won't vote for Trump in November. If Trump is banking on winning Pennsylvania with a coalition of disaffected Democrats and Republicans who haven't been motivated to vote in previous elections, he'll need to track them down. But Trump recently dismissed the high-tech voter outreach efforts that have become a key part of modern presidential campaigns as \"overrated.\" \"That's part of what makes me skeptical about Trump. He hasn't seemed particularly interested in building a big ground game,\" said Sarah Niebler, a political scientist at Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pa. \"And I think that's what it would take in these rural counties. It's a lot of ground to cover \u2014 just physical voters \u2014 to find those voters, to register those voters, and to mobilize them to turn out in November.\" Niebler thinks Trump would need to pull the political equivalent of a royal flush to win the Keystone State. \"He would need to find new Republican voters that aren't currently registered, attract Democratic voters to vote for him, he'd have to win pretty much all the independents, or he'd have to win Republicans by a much wider margin than Clinton wins Democrats,\" she said. But picking up Pennsylvania is Trump's most feasible route to the White House. \"This path is dependent on Trump being able to use his populist, protectionist and anti-globalization rhetoric to fire up white, working-class voters affected by outsourcing in the Rust Belt and Upper Midwest,\" NPR Political Editor Domenico Montanaro put it in NPR's initial electoral college analysis last week. In other words, expect Trump to make a lot of visits to places like Scranton, Johnstown, Altoona and Wilkes-Barre over the next six months.",

            "article_content": "Voters in West Virginia and Nebraska are heading to the polls Tuesday in the presidential primary contests.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: So even though the focus of the presidential race has shifted to the general election, there are still primaries schedules for several more weeks. Today, Democratic and Republican voters in West Virginia had their say. Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump are the projected winners there. Trump also won in Nebraska where there was a Republican primary today. To talk more about these contests and the general election, NPR's Domenico Montanaro is with us once again. Hi, Domenico. DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Hey, Ari. SHAPIRO: Does this win for Bernie Sanders change anything for him tonight or for Hillary Clinton for that matter? MONTANARO: Well, it's certainly going to mean that Hillary Clinton's going to have to fight a two-front battle that she wasn't hoping that she was going to have to do. You know, she was hoping perhaps to clinch, cross the magic number of 2,383 delegates perhaps next week - looks like now that's going to wind up being on June 7. Now, for Bernie Sanders, though - he's going to own May. I mean, he's going to win in Indiana, win in West Virginia. He may very well win next week in Kentucky and Oregon. But he's not going to net enough delegates to change the math very much. After tonight, he's going to need two-thirds of all remaining delegates to win a pledged majority. But that may very well not be the point for Bernie Sanders. SHAPIRO: Well, what is the point in that case? What's his endgame here? MONTANARO: (Laughter) Well, the endgame, you know, for Bernie Sanders is - you start to hear him talk a lot more about the message and about how to affect the change within the Democratic Party. They're going to want to have a big imprint on that Democratic Party platform this summer in Philadelphia when that gets written. And you should note, you know, Hillary Clinton stayed in until June. She did much better than Barack Obama at the end, but Obama only won by 69 pledged delegates - right now, Hillary Clinton up by more than 280. SHAPIRO: So barring any unexpected events, it looks like Hillary Clinton will face Donald Trump in November. What is the path for each of them when you look at the map in the general election? MONTANARO: Well, it's pretty fascinating because right now you can put Hillary Clinton at 270 electoral votes going based on history and demography in some of the states that Barack Obama won. She could lose Florida, Ohio, Colorado, Iowa, North Carolina - all these traditional swing states. As long as she wins Virginia, Nevada, two places that demographically have been trending Democratic - New Hampshire, which the president's won a couple times - Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, which have gone Democratic for almost 30 years - but of course, that's a place that Donald Trump is going to want to try to compete as well... SHAPIRO: And that's even without Clinton winning Florida and Ohio. MONTANARO: Right. SHAPIRO: What would the path be for Trump? MONTANARO: Well, and that's the thing, you know? This - the message of trade, which is something that Bernie Sanders has really hit Hillary Clinton on pretty hard because, you know, her husband, Bill Clinton, had signed the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA - the problem for Donald Trump is, if he's going to try to compete in places like Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania - again, places that have gone Democratic for 30 years - he has to win in those kinds of places in order to win. Even picking up a place like Florida, you know, he's going to have to do so with a changing demography where we had in the 1980s about half the electorate - white, working-class. Now that's only about a third, and that presents a major challenge for Donald Trump - steep, uphill climb. But you know, it's very, very early, and we should emphasize that. SHAPIRO: That's NPR's political editor Domenico Montanaro. Thanks, as always, Domenico. MONTANARO: Hey, thanks, Ari. Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "Hillary Clinton would have a significant electoral advantage over Donald Trump in the general election, based on an NPR analysis. The Democratic former secretary of state would start out with already exactly enough electoral votes to win the presidency, 270-191, based on states considered safe, likely and to lean toward either candidate. The ratings, which will be updated at least monthly until Election Day, are based on fundamentals \u2014 historical trends and demographics, plus reporting and polling (both public and private). But there is also the potential that this fall's presidential battlegrounds could be re-sorted \u2014 pitting white, working-class voters, whom Trump is appealing to, against Latino voters, who appear to be in Clinton's corner. Traditional ways of thinking about the map should and will be challenged. So in addition to our current ratings, we also explore several possibilities and scenarios, including Trump's potential path and even two potential ties, based on Trump doing well in the Upper Midwest and Clinton racking up wins in competitive states where the Latino vote is important. Clinton 270-191 Safe D (164): California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine* (3 electoral votes), Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, D.C., Washington stateLikely D (37): Maine (1 EV), Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, OregonLean D (69): Michigan, Nevada, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Virginia, WisconsinPure Tossup (77): Colorado, Florida, Iowa, North Carolina, Ohio Lean R (11): ArizonaLikely R (44): Georgia, Indiana, Missouri, Nebraska* (1 EV), UtahSafe R (136): Alabama, Arkansas, Idaho, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska (4 EVs), North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, West Virginia, Wyoming *Nebraska and Maine allocate their electoral votes by congressional district \u2014 3 in Maine and 4 in Nebraska are considered safe for Democrats and Republicans, respectively; 1 each could potentially be in play. Barack Obama won 1 delegate out of Nebraska (Omaha) in 2008. Colorado, Florida, Iowa, North Carolina and Ohio are considered pure tossups at this point, according to the analysis. So even if Trump, who is the de facto Republican nominee, were able to get all of those, he would still come up short. Clinton 332-206 Considering strictly who is leading in public surveys, as curated by the website RealClearPolitics, Clinton would be ahead by a landslide 332-206. But that includes states where polling is within the margin of error. And, at this point, polling is almost irrelevant. The cases have not been litigated yet; the campaigns have not been waged; neither candidate has even officially crossed the magic number to win his or her respective primaries yet. Bottom line: There is a lot of time to go. (One note about Colorado: The only poll in the RCP average of the state is one Quinnipiac poll from November showing Trump up 11. That's hardly a good indicator of what will happen this upcoming November, but for the sake of having something to go on, it's why we put Colorado red. For a more up-to-date primer on the state of play in Colorado with on-the-ground reporting, check out Colorado Public Radio's Ben Markus' report here. It notes how the gender gap may be the biggest hurdle for Trump in Colorado.) Clinton 164-136 (safe)Clinton 201-180 (safe + likely) Democrats start out with an electoral edge because of demography \u2014 especially growing Latino populations in key states \u2014 as well as Democrats' clustering in big cities in big states, like California, New York and Illinois. Republicans, on the other hand, have seen their greatest appeal in the South and rural areas of the West and Midwest. Their biggest electoral vote state is Texas. So looking at just the seats considered \"safe,\" Clinton \u2014 or any Democrat \u2014 would start with a 164-136 advantage. Adding in the \"likely\" states, Democrats still lead 201-180. Donald Trump would argue that he can pick off some of these traditionally safe and likely Democratic states, notably his home state of New York, as well as bordering New Jersey, where Trump backer Chris Christie is governor. But there's just no evidence of that yet. Here's why: -- Trump may have won the New York primary, but the Republican primary was 91 percent white, according to exit polls. The 2012 general election was only 67 percent white. (New Jersey's primary comes up June 7, and Trump will probably win it. But that state, too, is far more diverse in a general election than in a GOP primary.) -- Neither state has gone Republican in almost 30 years. -- And Barack Obama won them both twice: New York by at least 28 points; New Jersey by at least 15. Because of Christie and because of Trump's proximity, we move New Jersey to \"likely\" instead of \"safe.\" But more would need to happen to move either into a \"lean\" category. And if polling does show them coming into play, it means other, more potentially reachable states have also very likely moved in Trump's favor. It's tempting to be safe and put the usual suspects in the tossup column. Significant resources will be spent in Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Nevada, New Hampshire and Virginia. Those are places where the fight will be waged. But that doesn't necessarily mean they're tossups. It also doesn't mean Republicans can't win there, but Clinton starts with an edge, because of history in some places and demography in others. Obama won all of these states twice. He won them by an average of 6 points in 2012 and 10 in 2008. Pennsylvania and Michigan haven't gone Republican since 1988; Wisconsin, since 1984 (although it was the closest state in 2004). Nevada, Virginia and New Hampshire had all once been swing states \u2014 George W. Bush won all three in 2000, but John Kerry won Nevada and New Hampshire. And Obama won all of them. Nevada and Virginia, in particular, have shifted more Democratic because of demography \u2014 Hispanics in Nevada; and in Virginia, Hispanics as well as Asians and exurban growth. What about ... ? Arizona: On the Republican side, the only lean state is Arizona. The state has gone Republican for the past 20 years \u2014 and arguably Bill Clinton won it only because Ross Perot pulled votes from George H.W. Bush. But the state has a significant percentage of Hispanic voters. It's something that has sitting Sen. John McCain, the 2008 GOP nominee, concerned that with Trump at the top of the ticket, it could fire up Latinos and get more out to the polls. Even though the state is 30 percent Hispanic, that group made up just 18 percent of the electorate in 2012. Georgia: Another state to watch. Its demography has become much more nonwhite, and Republicans won it by only 5 and 8 points in 2008 and 2012, respectively. One poll showed a Trump-Clinton race a dead heat, but given its presidential and down-ballot history, we are leaving it as \"likely\" GOP until there's more hard evidence. Utah: Though one poll in March ahead of the GOP primary showed Clinton winning by 2 points, we put that in likely for Trump, because (a) Utah has a long history of voting Republican (it hasn't gone Democratic since 1964), and (b) there was a very high number of undecided voters. In other words, no one was near 50 percent, and a Republican is far more likely to get there. Florida: You could argue that the Sunshine State is at least a finger on the scale for Democrats given its rapidly changing demography. The poll average has Clinton with a 5-point lead \u2014 and better ones in the average have it high single digits. That all makes you think. But, for now, we leave it a tossup, given its history. In addition to the tight races in 2000 and 2004, Obama won it by only 2 points in 2008 and less than 1 point in 2012. The real sorting, though, will be between white, working-class voters and Latinos. Which group is more motivated could determine the election. Republicans start at a demographic disadvantage in 2016 and have been at one for the past couple of election cycles, in large measure because the face of America is changing. It's especially getting more Hispanic and Asian. Latinos, in particular, have affected American politics in profound ways, and they are still underrepresented at the polls. Pollsters project that the share of the white vote will be its lowest in history, being at or possibly even dipping below 70 percent for the first time. That gives Democrats a significant advantage in key states like Florida, Virginia, New Mexico, Colorado and Nevada. It also could put in play places like Arizona and Georgia. Democrats hope one day that will mean Texas, too, which is already majority minority. But there are more Latino Republicans in Texas than anywhere in the country. Plus, in the Midwest, an area Trump has to likely do well in if he hopes to win, the population has decreased, and voters, especially white ones affected directly by trade, have gotten older. Trump 276-262 This path is dependent on Trump being able to use his populist, protectionist and anti-globalization rhetoric to fire up white, working-class voters affected by outsourcing in the Rust Belt and Upper Midwest. Trump believes he can do that with an anti-free trade message, especially against the wife of the president who signed the North American Free Trade Agreement. To do it: He would have to win all the \"likely\" and \"safe\" Republican states, then sweep Pennsylvania (20), Ohio (18), Michigan (16), Wisconsin (10) and Iowa (6). That would mean Trump could lose Virginia, Florida and Colorado \u2014 and you could even take away Iowa, and he still gets to 270. Trump 285-253 It also means he could trade Florida for Pennsylvania and win, too, by a wider margin, 285-253. Of course, this is also dependent on Trump being able to maintain Arizona and even North Carolina and Iowa, which have seen Latino growth. 269-269 There are at least two different 269-269 ties that we could come up with through Trump's \"trade winds\" route. They both, of course, depend on Florida. If there is a tie, it goes to the House, which is controlled by Republicans. (Here's an explanation.)",

Once a booming steel town, Gary's population has dropped sharply, resulting in abandonment and decay. Many manufacturing towns dot the cornfields and highways of Indiana, which holds its presidential primary Tuesday, but two in particular tell the story of very different economic fortunes, and political ties. Kokomo is an old auto town touched by President Obama's push to bail out the auto industry. And Gary is a rundown steel city with unusual ties to Republican frontrunner Donald Trump, who tried to jump start the city's economy in the '90s and '00s. But, that doesn't mean the presidential politics there line up with their benefactors. Indiana is the country's leading manufacturing state per capita \u2014 more than 17 percent of Hoosiers work in the industry. And despite recent global trends, manufacturing remains a major influence in the state's economy \u2014 as well as its presidential politics.

As Gary got rusty, Trump came ... and went Gary, Ind. is a city built by U.S. steel on the south shore of Lake Michigan. In the 1970s, tens of thousands of people worked in the mills. \"You know, all you really needed was a strong back and do what you're told,\" said Sam Woods, who has worked in the mills for more than 40 years. \"Jobs were so plentiful, if you got fired from one steel mill, you can go and put an application and get started working the next week at another steel mill in northwest Indiana.\" But, like other steel cities, Gary got rusty \u2014 jobs were lost, buildings abandoned. Then in the '90s a New York businessman came to this predominantly African-American town and promised a new future.

Donald Trump!'\" said Chuck Hughes, who was a city councilman when Trump got a license to build a casino in Gary. \"I met him ... and, I was excited, like everybody else.\" Gary was desperate, crime was high and jobs were scarce. \"Trump promised that he'd build the tallest, greatest hotel. I heard him say this out of his own mouth,\" said Hughes, who now works for the Gary Chamber of Commerce. But, as Hughes looks out on Buffington Harbor \u2014 where the 37,000 square-foot Trump casino boat once docked \u2014 he says Trump was full of bluster. \"It's not Trump Tower, it's not Trump Taj Mahal that he promised,\" Hughes said, pointing to the former Trump hotel, which looks more like a motel \u2014 a drab shade of tan with boxy windows, no gilded walls or crystal chandeliers. (The casino and hotel are now owned by Majestic Star). \"(Trump) didn't stick around long enough to make an impact in the community, he left,\" Hughes said. \"He left,\" he repeats with a laugh and tinge of disappointment.

Most people in the city don't think Trump's investments paid off. The current mayor, a Hillary Clinton surrogate, says Trump's investments taught them a lesson about the businessman-turned-candidate. \"He's gotten in, pulled as much equity as he can out of a project, and gone on to the next thing,\" said Gary Mayor Karen Freeman-Wilson. \"You have to have a long attention span if you're the president, I just don't think he has it.\" These days, Gary is still struggling economically.

U.S. Steel closed the coke plant in May of last year. The official unemployment rate is 7.5 percent, but the mayor estimates it's closer to 45 percent if you account for all the people who've given up looking for work. Those once ubiquitous middle class steel mill jobs are disappearing \u2014 fewer people work in the mills because of both globalization and machine modernization. Woods is one of the lucky ones who still has a job in a Gary mill, and he's a long-time a Democrat. \"Bill Clinton was one of the best presidents we've ever had,\" said Woods. \"But, he sucker punched us. The worst thing he did was - he pushed NAFTA.\" Woods thinks Hillary Clinton will also try to push through trade deals like TPP that will hurt manufacturing. So Woods plans to vote for Bernie Sanders. For similar reasons, in Tuesday's Republican primary, Trump \u2014 who courts white working class voters and often speaks about global trade as a detriment to American manufacturing \u2014 is expected to perform well in this corner of the state. But, overall, Gary, and Lake County more broadly, is solidly Democratic turf. President Obama won the the area by more than 30 percentage points in 2012.

Did Obama's auto bailout help Kokomo bounce back? Drive about two hours southeast, and you'll find another manufacturing hub \u2014 Kokomo has a very different political history and economic fortune. Whereas Gary has suffered from a steady economic decline, Kokomo's economic collapse (and subsequent resurgence) has been more severe. The auto bailout \u2014 first initiated by George W. Bush and then pushed through by President Obama \u2014 had a direct impact here. Chrysler has three massive transmission plants in the area that collectively manufactures more transmissions than any other domestic factory the company owns. Thousands of people work in Kokomo's Chrysler facilities. But, the city got hammered during the recession. There was a point in June 2009 when unemployment hit 20.2 percent. \"I just remember when I got notified that I got let go, 800 people were let go the same day,\" said Randy Rusch, an engineer who used to work for the auto electronics company Delco. \"There were a bunch of people meeting right here,\" Rusch said over bites of beef brisket at a popular local brewery. \"So that whole bar section was full of people, all of whom were leaving Delco.\" People in Kokomo say the city felt like a ghost town \u2014 the mall was empty, small businesses shuttered, houses foreclosed and some families even left town. But, then in 2008 and 2009, the federal government intervened with the auto bailout. It rescued Chrysler and GM \u2014 two major employers here. And, the unemployment rate last year fell below 5 percent. These days, in and around Kokomo, Chrysler employs about double the number of employees it had in 2009, according to a company spokesman. And, plenty of people, particularly Democrats, credit the Obama administration for rescuing the city. They say Kokomo would have suffered from a 1930s-style depression if it weren't for the auto bailout. And, when the city's Democratic mayor endorsed Clinton he explicitly praised her support of the auto bailout. Kokomo By The Numbers Current unemployment rate: 6.8 percent (March 2016, BLS) The town's rate was well below 5 percent for part of 2015. Peak recession unemployment rate: 20.2 percent (January 2009) 2012 presidential vote in Howard County, Ind.: Obama: 41.7 percent Romney: 56 percent But, not everyone feels that way. Many people say Kokomo got itself out of the gutter through the hard work of local politicians, strong community organizations, and vibrant civic institutions. Even Rusch, who lost his job in the car industry, feels conflicted about the bailout. \"I see the negatives here, I see some positives here,\" he said. Rusch's pension got cut, and he blames the Obama administration for not handling the situation correctly. Rusch leans Republican and plans to vote for Ted Cruz in the Indiana primary. And, he's not unusual. Kokomo is in Howard County, a consistently red section of the state in presidential elections. Despite the auto industry's recovery \u2014 in the last election, Obama lost Howard County by about 14 points (56 percent Romney to 41.7 percent Obama), partly because of men like Ted Kenworthy, a lapsed Democrat, who supported Romney. Auto worker Ted Kenworthy in front of the Chrysler plant last Wednesday in Kokomo. During a 2010 visit to Kokomo, President Obama said the auto bailout greatly benefited the city.\n                \n                    \n                    Taylor Glascock for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Auto worker Ted Kenworthy in front of the Chrysler plant last Wednesday in Kokomo. During a 2010 visit to Kokomo, President Obama said the auto bailout greatly benefited the city. \"A lot of guys when they hear me say this, I really catch a lot of flack. They want to say 'well, if it wasn't for Obama, we wouldn't have a job.' And, I go, 'bull.' That is not. I don't believe that,\" said Kenworthy, a union employee at Chrysler. Kenworthy thinks Chrysler would have survived without help from Washington. \"We would have been better off had they let us go through the regular process of bankruptcy and come back and build our company back up instead of the government coming in and bailing us out,\" he said. Kenworthy plans to vote in the Indiana primary Tuesday, though he's still undecided about which candidate he'll choose. But, he knows for sure - whom he will not vote for. \"I will not vote for Hillary,\" he said. \"I think she could probably be the worst thing this country's ever seen.\" Kenworthy voted for Bill Clinton in the '90s, but he says Hillary Clinton scares him. And he wants a Republican in the White House. \"She's too much of a liberal,\" he said. \"Put people to work, quit giving people everything.\" And, so even though Hillary Clinton is the candidate running on President Obama's record and the legacy of the auto bailout, some people in Kokomo will not support her. And, maybe that's the lesson of these two cities. Economic investment \u2014 in Donald Trump or President Obama's case \u2014 isn't always enough to buy political goodwill.

            "article_content": "Indiana could make or break Donald Trump's chances at the GOP nomination. The state is key in Ted Cruz and John Kasich's strategy to force Trump into a contested convention.  KELLY MCEVERS, HOST: Indiana can be the state that makes or breaks Donald Trump's quest to reach that magic number of delegates, 1,237. Both Ted Cruz and John Kasich are now mathematically eliminated from getting the Republican nomination. Their only hope is to force Donald Trump into a contested convention, and Indiana is key to that strategy. But it could be tough. NPR's Asma Khalid reports. ASMA KHALID, BYLINE: Indiana's my home state, grew up here, went to college here. It's a reliably red state, and it's also a microcosm of the Republican Party's civil war. There are two kinds of Republicans here competing for space - the pro-business folks and the evangelicals. And then there are people like James Rasp. JAMES RASP: I've never voted, period. KHALID: I met Rasp at a Trump rally the other day. He's 50, a doctor, and he tells me this is his first time voting ever. He decided to register because of Trump's nationalist, economic message. RASP: The whole country's in trouble if there's no jobs. KHALID: Rasp wanted me to know that he doesn't love all of Trump's foreign policy ideas. RASP: Some of this stuff he says is stupid, idiotic, but the economy is number one. If you don't fix that, everything else is a loss. KHALID: Trump has a built-in base here. Indiana's the leading manufacturing state in the country. And there have been some ups and downs in that industry here, so there are plenty of white working-class voters who like what Trump's saying about trade. Then there are Republicans for whom religion comes first. ED NEUFELDT: Lord, I come to you at this time, and I thank you for this food that we're about to eat. KHALID: That's Ed Neufeldt. I met him over lunch in Elkhart County. Neufeldt rose to fame for introducing President Obama at his speech during the recession. NEUFELDT: I think the people that are really churchgoers and the real believers, I think they'll go with Ted Cruz instead of Donald Trump. KHALID: Neufeld says initially he liked Trump, but... NEUFELDT: Well, he just made the statement that he thought it was all right for transgenders to go in any bathroom that they wanted to. I don't know. I just don't think that's right. KHALID: And so now Neufeldt is leaning toward Cruz. Cruz has the backing of many social conservatives, but to win, he needs to expand that support. And so he picked former Hewlett-Packard executive Carly Fiorina to be his running mate. And he's agreed not to compete with Ohio Gov. John Kasich for votes. In Indiana, the thinking is that if Kasich doesn't campaign here, his supporters will line up behind Cruz. SAM POLLOCK: I'm leaning towards John Kasich right now. KHALID: Sam Pollock is a college student from Southern Indiana. I first met him last week when he was torn between Kasich and Cruz, and he had some reservations. POLLOCK: I just think Ted Cruz is too religious for me. KHALID: Pollock's the kind of voter Cruz will need to win over. So after this deal with Kasich and Cruz was announced, I wondered if he had changed his mind, and we gave him a ring. POLLOCK: Hello? KHALID: He says he did have a change of heart. POLLOCK: You got to pick the best of the worst, and, you know, I didn't want to vote for him, but I figured it was the best choice as a part of an attempt to stop Trump. KHALID: Pollock is voting for Cruz, but the assumption that pro-Kasich voters are naturally pro-Cruz voters could be a gamble in Indiana. Up north in Elkhart, Jan Mellott runs a business with her husband. They make curtains and bedding for RVs. Elkhart got hit hard during the recession. These days, Mellott's business is thriving, but the economy is key in her vote. JAN MELLOTT: I don't care for Cruz. He's a little too conservative for me, possibly. That's part of it. I feel like I'm being preached to all the time. I like John Kasich. I don't think he's electable, and I wanted to pick a Republican president. So that's where my vote went. KHALID: Mellott voted earl. Her choice... MELLOTT: I mean, I voted for Donald Trump. Am I in love with him? No. KHALID: And so it seems for some Hoosiers, Trump is less polarizing than Cruz.

            "article_content": "Donald Trump is hoping for big wins in Tuesday's primaries, as his rivals focus on future contests to deny him the nomination.  AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: It's Tuesday, which means people are voting in primaries somewhere in the country. Today, five Northeastern states are picking between the five remaining presidential candidates, and we'll be talking about the Democrats elsewhere in the program. But we'll start with Republicans, and here to talk us through the state of that race - NPR reporter Asma Khalid - hey there, Asma... ASMA KHALID, BYLINE: Hey, Audie. CORNISH: ...And Sarah McCammon. Hey there, Sarah. SARAH MCCAMMON, BYLINE: Hi there. CORNISH: Sarah, I want to start with you. You're just outside of New York, and I under you've been following the Trump campaign this week. What does that campaign look like? MCCAMMON: Well, Donald Trump is ahead in most of the polls in all five states. He's the front-runner looking to have another big night. But the other candidates, John Kasich and Ted Cruz, have a shot at getting some delegates as well. Trump still won't have enough delegates at the end of the day to make that magic number of 1,237 to clinch the Republican nomination, but there is a good chance chance that both of his rivals will be mathematically eliminated. That means they couldn't mathematically get enough delegates to get the nomination on the first round of voting. Kasich's already there. Cruz may well be after tonight. The never-Trump movement is working, though, to make sure his path to the nomination is even more difficult. CORNISH: Let's go back to that math for a second because the other two candidates, John Kasich and Ted Cruz, have essentially made a kind of non-compete agreement (laughter) in some states - right? - that come after today. What does that mean, and how is that affecting the Trump campaign? MCCAMMON: Right. They've basically each agreed in a handful of states to stay out of each other's way in places where they think the other candidate has a chance of taking delegates away from Trump. So Cruz is getting out of the way, not campaigning in Oregon or New Mexico, letting Kasich make his play there, and Kasich is getting out of Cruz's way in Indiana. This is a race to watch because polls suggest that Cruz is within a few points of Trump - single digits behind him, could possibly close that gap. And you know, Trump, though, has been mocking this. He - I was at an event last night in Pennsylvania where he called it sad, says both of them should just get out of the race. And Trump supporters think this is unfair and more dirty politics, as they call it. CORNISH: Asma, I want to get into this more with you because you're in Indianapolis. What do voters there say about this pact? KHALID: Well, Audie, the think to remember is that the delegates in Indiana have already been selected, and they align pretty staunchly against Trump. They're mostly John Kasich or Ted Cruz supporters. In terms of the voters, though, I sort of met a cross-section of people. There was one guy in Southern Indiana that I had spoken to the other week, and he was torn between Cruz and Kasich. And he said after this sort of non-compete, he decided to go with Ted Cruz even though he has some reservations because he really wants to stop Donald Trump from getting the 1,237 delegates he needs in order to secure the nomination on the first ballot. And the non-compete is kind of tricky to understand. I mean, Ted Cruz - he's holding a big rally tonight at a basketball gym in Indiana. But John Kasich - you know, even though he's not holding public events, he is also here in the state, and I was told that he's holding a fundraiser. CORNISH: Meanwhile, what are they up against in terms of Trump support or in terms of the kind of stop-Trump movement in Indiana? KHALID: There are ads showing that are part of the stop-Trump movement, but Donald Trump himself has also been airing a number of television ads across the state. And he has a fairly solid support base. I think one thing to remember also is that Indiana - it has a very large manufacturing sector. It's a sector that's sort of taken a beating, but it's still around here. And so there are many white, working-class voters that Trump seems to do fairly well with. And I think he has a natural support base. The other thing is that the assumption that this Cruz and Kasich sort of non-competes would help Ted Cruz could possibly be a bit of a miscalculation. I spoke with one woman who really liked Governor Kasich, but she decided to go with Donald Trump. And so, you know, it's sort of tricky to see where all those votes may fall. CORNISH: That's Asma Khalid speaking to us from Indianapolis. Thanks so much, Asma. KHALID: You're welcome. CORNISH: And Sarah McCammon - she's traveling with the Trump campaign. Thanks so much.

            "article_content": "After his near sweep in New York, Donald Trump goes into the next round of primaries, in the eastern seaboard, strong. But he could be tested in Indiana, which holds its primary in early May. His GOP rivals are making a play for Indiana.  ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: Donald Trump won big in New York yesterday and is expected to pull off wins in the upcoming primary races along the East Coast, too. So the next big question mark hangs over Indiana. Voters head to the polls there on May 3. NPR's Asma Khalid is in Indiana, and he's been talking to voters. She now joins us from the state fairgrounds, where Donald Trump just wrapped up a rally. Hi, Asma. ASMA KHALID, BYLINE: Hi, Robert. SIEGEL: Trump brought out a big crowd today in Indianapolis, as he tends to. Tell us what you saw. KHALID: Well, there were a few thousand people here, and I would say I met an interesting mix of people, including this tattoo artist. He told me he supported Obama - President Obama eight years ago, but now he likes Trump because of sort of a similar message, he said, of change. I think, in some ways, Indiana is very friendly turf for Donald Trump. And I would say that because it's a leading manufacturing state. There are plenty of white, working-class voters. And those are folks who, in other states so far, have supported Trump in higher numbers than any other group. Indiana's also a place that has suffered tremendously, both from trade and opioid abuse. One woman we spoke to called it the Mississippi of the North. Some folks here, I think, are just frustrated, and they're looking for a candidate who could upend, you know, the entire political system. You know, I would also say the fact, though, that Trump was here this afternoon - the day after he swept his home state - you know, not just holding a rally, but he also met with the governor - I think that's a sign of how important Indiana is. SIEGEL: Fifty-seven delegates, I believe. KHALID: Exactly. SIEGEL: Have you been able to get out of Indianapolis yet? KHALID: Yeah. We spent the day yesterday in Vigo County, Ind. It's in the southwest part of the state. It's actually the most inaccurate bellwether county in the country, so a really fascinating place. And there we met a cross-section of voters. I talked to folks who like Ted Cruz, people who like John Kasich and Donald Trump. And I think that is fairly reflective of the state. I would say, for a lot of the voters, I think what they expressed to me most was that this is a really exciting moment for Hoosiers. They are surprised that they're getting this much attention. I spoke with one gentleman. His name is Randy Gentry. He's the head of the Republican Party in Vigo County. And he says, this is just really unchartered territory for folks. RANDY GENTRY: If you go back and look at, you know, history as far as presidential races, this is usually over by now - Indiana's not even in play. You know, I mean, we're getting to see something that I've never seen in my lifetime, where we actually are in play. KHALID: And Gentry told me, you know, he just recently decided to support Trump. But he says folks across the state are realizing that Indiana could be a tipping point. SIEGEL: Asma, do any of the other candidates seem to have an edge in Indiana? KHALID: Yeah, well, I've talked to folks who are quite involved in Indiana politics, and they think that all three GOP candidates have a distinct constituency here. Indiana, I think, is kind of unique in that way. And one thing I will say that is clear in terms of local politics in Indiana is that there are two kinds of Republicans in the state. And the two wings of Republican ideology here align almost perfectly with the Kasich and the Cruz campaigns, so let me explain that, you know, for a second. There's the establishment, pro-business wing of the party. This is what folks here would refer to as the Mitch Daniels Republican Party. He was the former governor of Indiana. And this would be a natural support base for John Kasich. He's also - you know, Kasich, being the neighboring - governor of a neighboring state, is well-known. Then, there's also the strong conservative, religious side of the party and a powerful evangelical force would align with Ted Cruz. SIEGEL: Now, Indiana has already chosen the delegates, the individuals who'll be at the convention. Does - do those choices give an advantage to one candidate over another? KHALID: Well, the delegates who have been selected so far seem to support John Kasich or Ted Cruz. I think the delegate list is definitely not lined up in favor of Donald Trump. And folks say that they will vote the way that they need to, but thereafter, they may vote for whoever they like after that first ballot at the convention. SIEGEL: That's Asma Khalid in Indianapolis. Asma, thanks. KHALID: You're welcome. Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.  Visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.

            "article_content": "Catch up with these interviews from NPR's New York primary night special coverage, hosted by Scott Detrow. On whether Sanders' momentum is really a factor  I think that when you're talking about the wins over the last few weeks, what you see is he's winning states with not as much of a diverse electorate. Where you see Hillary Clinton racking up delegates [is] in Arizona, Texas, Florida, and places that reflect the rest of America. She's definitely winning the more diverse states but what you're also seeing is negative campaigning from Bernie Sanders. And we think that these false attacks are not only destructive to Hillary but are destructive to the Democratic Party as a whole. On Sanders' negative campaigning As Democrats, we should not be fighting amongst each other and having a negative campaign tone. We need to come together and have a positive campaign. It's one thing to talk about \u2014 to do the negative campaigning. It's another to talk about the issues. Voters don't want to hear the back and forth on the negative campaigning. They want to hear about how you're going to fight for them and how your policies are different from the other candidate. Carl Paladino, seen in 2010, is the Co-Chair of Donald Trump's New York campaign.\n                \n                    \n                    Hiroko Masuike/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Carl Paladino, seen in 2010, is the Co-Chair of Donald Trump's New York campaign. On winning in NovemberI think we're going to win New York in November. You have to remember \u2014 no one has been talking about all of Hillary's gaffes and faults and problems. Donald Trump's going to be talking about it. When he points it out to the people of the state of New York, we're going to see a lot of people abandoning the Democratic Party, especially the working class. The middle class doesn't have any business being in the Democratic Party today. On Trump's appealHe's a hometown guy. At the end of the day, he's from the outer boroughs. I know he's this rich, elite guy that we see but he's not a Manhattan guy. He came from Queens \u2014 from the outer boroughs \u2014 that means something to us. And he's the outsider. He's the political outsider. We've seen that for the last twelve years with Michael Bloomberg having a businessman run this city and then we've seen two years [with] what the New York City mayor has done as a politician only ... We want to see the country change. We want to bring some of the things that Michael Bloomberg and that business mentality brought to the nation. On choosing a nominee at the convention other than TrumpIf they just blatantly stole it from him I would have some big issues with going to vote for whoever the Republican nominee would be. But Donald's the dealmaker and we need to see him make this deal to make it happen. If he's going to do it in politics, just like he's kind of gotten beat with delegates in a couple states where he wasn't paying attention...he needs to come to the table. He's got to make the deal happen if he wants the presidency and the nomination. Ron Nehring, seen in 2003 with Arnold Schwarzenegger, is a national spokesman for Ted Cruz and the Cruz campaign chairman in California.\n                \n                    \n                    David McNew/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Ron Nehring, seen in 2003 with Arnold Schwarzenegger, is a national spokesman for Ted Cruz and the Cruz campaign chairman in California. On a path for CruzWe'll pick up delegates along the way. We've taken a look at each state and our opportunities there. We've already launched a campaign in Maryland. We were in Pennsylvania tonight. And we'll continue to campaign throughout those states that participate in the Northeast primary, as it's called. Then we move out west again where we're looking strong in Nebraska, Indiana, and the like. On Trump's claims that the system is \"rigged\" Donald Trump has to blame somebody when he's losing. He lost five states in a row. He can't take responsibility for that so he has to blame somebody. He blames us, or he blames the rules, or he blames the Republican Party, or the weather or astronomical phenomenons. He always has to have somebody else to blame. If the system is rigged, it's rigged in his favor because he's only won about 37 percent of the vote but he has about 45 percent of the delegates \u2014 so maybe he wants to give up those delegates that he 'unfairly' has at this point. The reality is that the rules are what they are. Everybody knew what the rules are. On Sanders' N.Y. loss Tad Devine, seen at a Democratic debate in February, is a senior advisor for the Sanders campaign.\n                \n                    \n                    Tom Lynn/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Tad Devine, seen at a Democratic debate in February, is a senior advisor for the Sanders campaign. I think that when all the votes are in, we'll have had a pretty good day in New York today. This is Hillary Clinton's home state. It's a state that is very strict in terms of participation. Independents cannot vote there. They make it very difficult for people to switch their parties by putting the deadlines months before. We always knew that beating her in her home state, where she's well known and very popular, would be difficult. We wanted to get a lot of delegates out of today and I think by the time all of the votes are counted we will. On converting Sanders supporters' enthusiasm into primary wins We did convert it into a win in Wisconsin by 14 points. We did convert it to a win in Michigan, which is a pretty big populous state. Bernie Sanders is new to this process. He's never run for national office before. He hasn't been in the national limelight for decades as Hillary Clinton has been. And I think the support for him is growing. It's true \u2014 there is incredible enthusiasm. Frankly that lack of enthusiasm, the fact that Hillary Clinton not only cannot draw those crowds but the depth of her support doesn't seem to be anywhere near what it is for Bernie, is a troubling sign for the Democrats.",

The results from Tuesday night's New York primary could be crucial in determining whether either (or both) of the presidential nominating contests is clinched anytime soon. The Empire State is a delegate-rich prize for both parties \u2014 95 delegates are up for grabs in the GOP race, while 247 pledged delegates will be decided on the Democratic side. Donald Trump has a chance to sweep all, or close to all, of the delegates because of how they will be allocated on the GOP side. Democrats allocate proportionally, and that makes it harder for Bernie Sanders, who needs to win with 57 percent, or he loses ground in the pledged-delegate race. National front-runners Trump and Hillary Clinton are the favorites in New York, the state they both call home. But their rivals will try to turn pockets of support across the state into at least some delegate victories. Here's where and what to watch in both primaries. Polls close at 9 p.m. ET. Virtually every recent poll has shown the New York real-estate magnate topping 50 percent in his home state's GOP primary, which would give him a sweep of the 11 at-large delegates plus the three delegates bound to the statewide winner. But it's the 81 delegates awarded proportionally based on congressional districts \u2014 three in each \u2014 that could get interesting. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Ohio Gov. John Kasich are each trying to find pockets of support where they can scavenge some delegates. Their goal is to hold Trump below 50 percent in some districts and capture at least one of the available delegates in each district. Otherwise, Trump would sweep. \"While we're seeing in polling that Trump has a commanding lead, Kasich and Cruz have some support,\" said former Republican U.S. Rep. Tom Reynolds, who represented the Buffalo area for a decade. \"But it's nowhere near Trump.\" Reynolds, a former National Republican Congressional Committee chairman, pointed to his home of Western New York as a place where Trump has particular strength. Rep. Chris Collins, who now holds Reynolds' former House seat, was the first member of Congress to endorse the controversial Republican presidential hopeful at the end of February. Since then, Trump has amassed the backing of many of the region's county GOP chairmen, plus his statewide campaign co-chairman Carl Paladino, the 2010 GOP nominee for governor, also hails from the western corner. Trump held his final election-eve rally in Buffalo, too, complete with an introduction from Buffalo Bills head coach Rex Ryan. \"The further West,\" Reynolds said, \"the stronger it becomes in Trump country. In visits he's made to Albany, Syracuse, Rochester and now Buffalo, there's a swelling of attendance there in support, and the further West you go, the stronger it is.\" Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion, agreed that Western New York could well be one place where Trump cleans up with delegates, along with much of New York City itself. \"His big strengths are in the city and the suburbs,\" Miringoff said. \"Trump does better Downstate than he does Upstate, but that doesn't mean he can't get to 50 [percent] in those districts, either.\" Staten Island, the only Republican-leaning borough in the city, could be one of the biggest Trump strongholds, and is almost tailor-made for the outspoken politician, with its blue-collar, working-class electorate. (An Optimus Consulting survey showed Trump topping 70 percent there.) Some places where Cruz might break through, Miringoff said, are actually in traditionally Democratic areas. He's campaigned in solidly blue places like The Bronx and Queens, and the small number of Republicans there wield outsize influence compared with districts outside the city, as NPR's Scott Detrow reported. For Kasich, he could find some support in suburban areas just outside New York City and in Western New York. But Trump is still performing well in those places, too. \"The problem that Kasich finds himself in is that he's been doing better in the suburbs, but Trump is also very strong there,\" Miringoff said. \"If Kasich were to pick up some delegates, it might be in the suburbs around Albany and Buffalo, but Trump is also very strong there. Kasich may get some significant votes, but it may not amount to much\" if he can't hold Trump below 50 percent. Reynolds also predicted that some Downstate metro counties could be good for Kasich, like Westchester, Orange and Rockland in the 17th and 18th districts. His recent endorsement from former New York Gov. George Pataki, who was briefly in the 2016 race, could help him in pockets statewide, too. Pataki is from Poughkeepsie, in Dutchess County, about an hour-and-a-half north of Manhattan. Ultimately, though, if his rivals can't hold Trump below 50 percent in a significant number of congressional districts, Trump could get very close to taking all of the 95 delegates at stake. If that's the case, Trump would then need somewhere around just 53 percent of the remaining delegates to hit the 1,237 he needs to clinch the GOP nomination. (That number rises to about 60 percent of remaining bound delegates available.) That could go a long way to erasing some of the incremental delegate wins Cruz has gotten by outmaneuvering Trump at recent state conventions in Colorado, North Dakota and Wyoming. Hillary Clinton waves to a crowd at a Women for Hillary event at the New York Hilton hotel Monday in Midtown Manhattan.\n                \n                    \n                    Kathy Willens/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Hillary Clinton waves to a crowd at a Women for Hillary event at the New York Hilton hotel Monday in Midtown Manhattan. Final surveys in the state have given Clinton at least a double-digit advantage, which could climb up into the high teens. Clinton has never trailed in a poll in the New York primary. It's a closed primary, too, which gives Clinton a big advantage. She has done much better in this primary when only registered Democrats are voting. The Democrats' bitter debate last week in Brooklyn underscored the tensions of just how much is at stake for both in New York. If Clinton can get a clear majority of the 247 delegates up for grabs, she'll expand her 244-pledged-delegate advantage over the Vermont senator. And with leads in states that will vote next week, such as Maryland, Pennsylvania and other Northeastern states, she could soon make it nearly mathematically impossible for Sanders to catch her. Of course, if Sanders could pull off the win in New York, it could change the narrative \u2014 if not the math. A big Clinton win in her adopted home state could be a big turning point in the race for her, but she'll still need to fight off Sanders in each congressional district if she wants a significant sweep. A total of 163 delegates will be awarded proportionally in each of the 27 congressional districts. Each candidate must simply reach at least a 15 percent threshold to qualify to get any delegates in each district. The state has areas that play to each candidate's strengths. In New York City, Sanders is expected to do well in whiter, more upscale communities like Park Slope in Brooklyn and in younger, more gentrified areas. But Clinton is expected to perform best in the more diverse boroughs, such as in African-American pockets in Brooklyn, Harlem and The Bronx. Outside of the Big Apple, things could be more competitive. The two run nearly even in Upstate New York, according to Miringoff, and outside of the city suburbs, north of Clinton's home in Westchester County, their support could be pretty evenly divided. But if Clinton racks up a significant delegate advantage, Sanders' path to the 2,383 delegates he needs and to convince superdelegates to back him gets that much more complicated. \"Delegate-wise, I think [Clinton] wins the lion's share of the delegates,\" Miringoff predicted, \"and that makes it hard for Sanders to make the argument he's on his way to closing.\"",

Three of the five candidates on both sides of the aisle hail from New York in some way or another, so which candidate truly has a home court advantage is questionable. But, demographics might offer a clue. Historical and current U.S. Census data suggest that New York's demographics are unusual compared with other states that have already voted this primary season. No doubt, New Yorkers have their own state of mind, but, a few demographic trends help us understand the electorate. A few things to watch: 1. Urban In 2008, half of the state's Democratic primary voters came from the New York City area. And voter registration data as of April 1 predict a similar picture this year \u2014 52 percent of active Democratic voters reside within New York City. New York is a diverse metro area; two-thirds of New Yorkers are black, Latino, Asian or multiracial. Hillary Clinton, so far, has shown an advantage with minority voters, winning African-Americans by huge margins across the country. Not all voters of a certain race vote the same way, but there have been patterns this campaign season that offer clues on how elections are likely to play out. NPR's Tamara Keith has reported that one of Clinton's biggest demographic weaknesses in the primary race has been her appeal to white men. But New York has a much smaller white male population than other states. In the 2008 primary, only 29 percent of Democrats were white men. Bernie Sanders has been doing better with white voters. In the most recent primary election \u2014 Wisconsin on April 5 \u2014 exit polls show Sanders beat Clinton by 19 percentage points (59 to 40 percent). But it's important to remember, New York just doesn't have as many white voters at stake. 2. Young It's worth pointing out that many urban voters are young. The urban and youth populations are not mutually exclusive. In 2008, about 15 percent of Democratic primary voters across New York were between the ages of 18 and 29, and many of them lived in the New York metro area. As compared to Wisconsin, which Bernie Sanders won, New York is more diverse, older and independents cannot vote \u2014 things that should help Hillary Clinton.\n                \n                    \n                    Domenico Montanaro/NPR/2008 and 2016 exit polls\n                    \n                \nhide caption And, so far this campaign, Sanders has consistently trounced Clinton in the 18- to 29-year-old demographic. According to exit poll data, Clinton won this age group in only two states: Alabama and Mississippi. On average, Sanders is winning these young voters by 41 points. Sanders performs well with young voters of all races and ethnicities. Young Asian, Latino and African-American voters in a number of states have preferred Sanders over Clinton. But young voters as a whole usually have the lowest voter turnout of any age group, and so Clinton has been able to keep her losses at a minimum by relying more on older voters. 3. No independents The other advantage for Clinton is that New York is a closed primary. In other words, independents are not allowed to vote \u2014 and that's bad news for Sanders. As of March 15, 40 percent of Sanders' support was coming from independents, as the Washington Post's Philip Bump noted. 4. Democratic turf On the Republican side, New York is Donald Trump's state to lose. He's consistently polling above 50 percent, and that's, well, huge. Trump often wins states with a plurality of the vote, but never with an outright majority. In fact, not once this campaign season has Trump broken the 50 percent threshold in any state. In his home state of New York, though, Trump is polling above that key mark. And that's important because if he gets above 50 percent in every congressional district, he will take home all 95 of the state's delegates. It's not just because he's a familiar face. Sure, the Trump campaign is headquartered in New York, and Trump owns multiple properties around town, but demographically, New York City is Trump territory. As David Wasserman with the Cook Political Report recently wrote for FiveThirtyEight, Trump does well in blue terrain. He won Cook County, Ill. (home to Chicago), for example, by more than 15 points. Wasserman argues that Trump is dominating majority-minority congressional districts by focusing on the white working class who live in those areas. \"Outside of Cruz's home state of Texas, Trump has won 15 of 17 majority-minority districts, or 88 percent,\" Wasserman wrote. \"By comparison, Trump has carried only 51 of 79 majority white districts (again excluding Texas), or 65 percent.\" 5. \"New York values\" OK, so this last point is more about values than demographics. Throughout the primary campaign, Ted Cruz has relentlessly tried to court Christian conservatives. But, as we've shown previously in our Perfect State Index, New Yorkers aren't particularly religious. About 45 percent of New Yorkers say religion is \"very important\" in their lives, compared to about 53 percent nationally. For some perspective, that number is upward of 70 percent in some of the traditional Bible Belt states. But the values battle between Cruz and Trump is about much more than religion \u2014 it's about territorial pride. In earlier voting states, Cruz had tried to rally voters by knocking those so-called \"New York values.\" In a GOP debate in January, Cruz used the line \"New York values\" as an insult aimed at Donald Trump. (NPR's Sarah McCammon has reported on the full back story of that moment and its potential impact in New York politics.) Cruz has essentially spent months campaigning against New York, and now he's trying to campaign in New York. It's a thin tightrope to walk. Last week in the Bronx, reporters asked Cruz about his \"New York values\" comment, and he doubled down. \"The people of New York know exactly what those values are,\" he said. He tried to clarify: \"It's the values of the liberal, Democratic politicians.\" New Yorkers don't seem persuaded. Recent polls show Cruz in last place, trailing both Trump and Ohio Gov. John Kasich.",

Sanders has often praised Pope Francis for his focus on economic inequality.\n                \n                    \n                    Don Gonyea /NPR \n                    \n                \nhide caption NPR's Don Gonyea spotted this poster at Bernie Sanders' Buffalo field office in New York. Sanders has often praised Pope Francis for his focus on economic inequality. Bernie Sanders will be taking a few days off the campaign trail to attend a Vatican conference about social, economic and environmental issues. The day after a debate in New York next week, Sanders will travel to Rome for the event. In an interview on MSNBC's Morning Joe, Sanders said he was \"a big, big fan of the pope.\" \"He has played an unbelievable role, unbelievable role in injecting a moral consequence into the economy,\" Sanders said. \"He's talking about the idolatry of money, the worship of money, the greed that's out there.\" In a statement from his campaign, Sanders praised the pope for focusing on income inequality \u2014 the defining issue of his own presidential campaign. \"Pope Francis has made clear that we must overcome 'the globalization of indifference' in order to reduce economic inequalities, stop financial corruption and protect the natural environment. That is our challenge in the United States and in the world,\" Sanders said in a statement. No meeting between Sanders and Pope Francis has been scheduled. Sanders, who is Jewish, has often praised the current pope. He previously referred to Francis as a \"socialist,\" in an interview obtained by The Washington Post. \"When (Pope Francis) talks about wealth being used to serve people, not as an end in itself, I agree with that,\" Sanders said in the interview. Sanders and Francis often speak about the economy in nearly identical ways. In 2014, the pope took to Twitter with this message: Inequality is the root of social evil. Francis is sometimes described as a \"liberal\" pope for his views on immigration, income inequality and the death penalty; but, Catholic teaching straddles political affiliation, particularly because of the Church's stance on same-sex marriage. With his public statements, Francis seems to have emboldened the church's social justice wing, and Democrats are widely embracing him. Last year, a number of big-city Democratic mayors (Boston's Marty Walsh and New York's Bill de Blasio) attended a Vatican conference on climate change. For Sanders, the trip's timing is also fortuitous, coming just ahead of the New York and Pennsylvania primaries (April 19 and April 26 respectively). Both states have sizable Catholic populations \u2014 a mix of traditionally Democratic white working class voters and a smaller, but growing, Hispanic community. The Pew Research Center estimates one-third of people in the New York City metro area identify as Catholic, and similarly, about a quarter (26 percent) in Philadelphia. Many of those Catholics lean left \u2014 46 percent surveyed by Pew in New York and Pennsylvania identify as Democrats. For a full breakdown of New York Catholic demographics, you can sift through the data on the Pew website. The Pennsylvania information is available here.",

            "article_content": "Hillary Clinton has been campaigning all over New York this week, making her pitch to working class voters from Harlem to Syracuse. Clinton hopes to peel away some of the support that her rival Bernie Sanders has won among these voters with his populist message.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: To get a sense of the tension in the Democratic race for president right now, we're going to New York. Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have been campaigning all across the state this week. The Democratic primary is April 19. As NPR's Sam Sanders reports, Clinton is working hard to get the attention of blue-collar workers, a group that's been listening closely to Bernie Sanders. SAM SANDERS, BYLINE: Hillary Clinton held a small-business roundtable in Syracuse, N.Y., Friday. She talked about her record of helping small businesses throughout the state during her time as senator. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) HILLARY CLINTON: I wanted to take what we did here in New York nationwide. SANDERS: Business owner after business owner talked about how Clinton helped them when she was a senator - the company that retrofitted school buses, the injection molding business that made infant healthcare products. There was even a woman in the room who said Clinton helped her start a wine ice cream company. Yep, that's what I said - a wine ice cream company. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) H. CLINTON: I'm looking forward to seeing wine ice cream in even more places. And if I'm so fortunate as to be elected president, it will be served in the White House, too. (LAUGHTER) SANDERS: Besides talking wine ice cream, Clinton also announced a new program to bring manufacturing jobs back to the U.S. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) H. CLINTON: If elected president, I'll invest $10 billion in a program I'm calling Make it in America. And that would be partnerships across the country doing what we did here in New York, bringing together universities, businesses, local state... SANDERS: It's all part of Clinton's big push to attract middle-class voters. Bernie Sanders has found a lot of support among the working class. And he's been hitting Clinton hard, saying she's tied too closely to Wall Street. In Harlem on Wednesday, Clinton touched on lots of themes Sanders does on the trail. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) H. CLINTON: We can create more good jobs with rising incomes by investing in manufacturing and small business and infrastructure and clean energy. We'll make companies that ship jobs overseas give back the tax breaks they got here at home. Isn't it time for raising the minimum wage nationwide? SANDERS: And Clinton said she's the one that can get all of this done. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) H. CLINTON: Now, my opponent and I share many of the same goals, but some of his ideas for how to get there won't pass. Others just won't work because the numbers don't add up. SANDERS: Hillary Clinton has not been making this case on her own. Bill Clinton spoke with union workers in Manhattan this week and said his wife has been fighting for New Yorkers for years. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BILL CLINTON: Go to Buffalo or Rochester or Syracuse or any of those places - they all got a story of when she had their back, when she just made something good happen. It's what she's been doing all her life. There's a big difference in talking and doing. SANDERS: Afterwards, I spoke with Kathy Begley. She works as an administrative assistant for the Service Employees International Union. They hosted the event. Do you think that Hillary Clinton is for the working class? KATHY BEGLEY: Yes, I do. SANDERS: More than Bernie Sanders? BEGLEY: That's difficult. SANDERS: Begley went on to say that she thinks both of the candidates have their hearts in the right place, but that Clinton has a track record to prove it. The question is whether enough New Yorkers will feel the same way. Sam Sanders, NPR News, New York. Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "Republicans hold a historic majority in the House of Representatives, but Donald Trump is challenging the basic assumptions that the GOP's grip on the majority is ironclad.  KELLY MCEVERS, HOST: The Republican Party has controlled the U.S. House of Representatives since the tea party wave of 2010. That control has not been in doubt until recently because of Donald Trump. NPR congressional reporter Susan Davis reports on how his rise could shake up Congress. SUSAN DAVIS, BYLINE: The prospect of Donald Trump at the top of the ticket has raised a question on Capitol Hill that six months ago no one was asking - could Democrats take over the House this year? Washington Democrat Denny Heck runs candidate recruitment for his party. He puts Democrats' chances this way. DENNY HECK: Everybody knows that Democrats in the House are going to gain seats this time, and it's just a question - how many? Even the Republicans will candidly admit that in private. But now we believe that our opportunity to pick up more is greater as a consequence of the, quote, \"Trump factor.\" DAVIS: That Trump factor, Heck says, could make competitive districts with three specific kinds of voters that find Trump most offensive. HECK: High education levels, high numbers of white-collar jobs or high numbers of Hispanics - any one of those would put in play some districts that otherwise we might have been in but are a little more enthused about now than we were before. DAVIS: And Democrats are favored to pick up seats. Their party historically performs better in presidential election years. But Democrats haven't been favored to win a majority since Republicans swept control six years ago. House Republicans are divided over whether Trump helps or hurts their races. On one side, our Republicans like South Florida Congressman Carlos Curbelo. His district is 70 percent Hispanic, and he thinks Latino voters will overwhelmingly oppose Trump this November. CARLOS CURBELO: I don't think the American people are going to respond well to someone who is so divisive and offensive to many voters. DAVIS: Curbelo has pledged to vote against Trump even if he's the nominee. But on the other side are Republicans like New York's Tom Reed. Reed says Trump's message opposing free trade pacts and bringing back manufacturing jobs resonates with voters in his swing district. And that's why Reed last week became the first Republican in a competitive House race this year to endorse Trump. He doesn't buy the talk that Trump has no appeal beyond his core base of white working-class voters. TOM REED: He's defying the laws of political gravity, and I think we're going into uncharted waters here. And when we especially get to uncharted waters, that's where the collective wisdom of the people is something I'm really sensitive to because I trust that wisdom. DAVIS: Pennsylvania's Lou Barletta agrees with Reed. He also endorsed Trump last week and has zero doubt that Trump will win Pennsylvania and help down ballot Republicans there. Barletta says Trump is not limiting the GOP's reach. He's redefining it. LOU BARLETTA: I think Donald Trump brings more Democrats and independents to the Republican Party. And I think this is an opportunity to have a new Republican Party made up of working men and working women, and we should be embracing that rather than trying to push away. DAVIS: To be clear, the math for Democrats is daunting. Republicans have their largest majority in nearly a century, and Democrats would need to pick up at least 30 seats for a takeover. The Cook Political Report, a nonpartisan election forecaster says Democrats would need to win 97 percent of Republican seats currently in play. That's why House Speaker Paul Ryan swatted down a question about whether Trump puts his majority at risk. He says Republicans' only concern is putting together a fresh policy agenda. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PAUL RYAN: I'm not concerned about the House flipping because we are in control of our own actions, and that means we are putting together an agenda to take to the country to show what we need to do to get this country back on the right track. DAVIS: The question for Democrats is whether they can put enough candidates on the field to capitalize if the Trump factor goes their way. Susan Davis, NPR News, Washington.

            "article_content": "Bernie Sanders and Ted Cruz each notched victories in Tuesday's Western contests, but Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump's big wins in Arizona still mean their overall delegate lead won't change much. On the Democratic side, Sanders won big victories in the Utah and Idaho caucuses, but the much smaller prizes could end up netting him roughly the same number of delegates Clinton will get from her Arizona win. In the GOP race, Trump claimed all 58 Arizona delegates thanks to his victory in the winner-take-all primary. It was by far the biggest prize of the night and a further complication for Republicans hoping to stop the controversial real estate mogul's march to the nomination. Trump's hard-line position on immigration and promise to build a massive border wall won him support of influential Republicans in the state, including former Gov. Jan Brewer and popular Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio. But there was still some encouraging news for the anti-Trump forces \u2014 the Associated Press projected that Cruz was on pace for a big win in Utah, finishing above the 50 percent threshold that would give him all 40 of the state's delegates. That also means John Kasich would net zero delegates from Tuesday's contests. The Ohio governor was running second in heavily Mormon Utah, where Trump was expected to struggle. But in Arizona, which had heavy early voting for nearly a month, Kasich was actually in fourth behind Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who ended his campaign last week. Even with such disappointing results, Kasich has not given any indication he would end his candidacy, and his campaign argued in a memo earlier Tuesday evening he was still the most electable general election candidate. After Clinton's win in Arizona \u2014 a state Sanders had hoped to contest \u2014 she cast an eye toward the general election, arguing she is the candidate best qualified on national security, particularly in the wake of Tuesday's deadly terrorist attacks in Brussels. \"What Donald Trump and Ted Cruz and others are suggesting, it's not only wrong, it's dangerous,\" she said of the GOP candidates' calls to close the U.S. borders and for more policing of Muslim communities. \"It will not keep us safe. This is a time for America to lead, not to cower.\" Despite his loss in Arizona, Sanders pointed to the heavy turnout the night's contests had sparked and argued he had come a long way in closing the gap with Clinton, given the deficit he started with last year. There was heavy turnout in both Idaho and Utah, where long lines delayed the caucuses' start. \"I am enormously grateful to the people of Utah and Idaho for the tremendous voter turnouts that gave us victories with extremely large margins,\" Sanders said in a statement early Wednesday morning. \"The impressive numbers of young people and working-class people who participated in the process are exactly what the political revolution is all about. These decisive victories in Idaho and Utah give me confidence that we will continue to win major victories in the coming contests.\" Democrats will turn their attention next to Saturday contests in Alaska, Hawaii and Washington state. For Republicans, there isn't another big contest for two weeks, when the remaining trio of GOP contenders will battle in Wisconsin on April 5.",

Donald Trump is the GOP delegate leader and has the clearest path to the presidential nomination of any remaining candidate. But does he have an electoral path to 270 in November? There's a basic math problem for any Republican nominee. In every one of the past six presidential elections, Democrats have won states that add up to about 240 electoral votes \u2014 pretty close to the majority needed to win. Republicans have won about 103 electoral votes in each of the past six elections, so there's a big hill to climb. Any GOP nominee has little room for error and would have to win all the big battleground states \u2014 Ohio, Florida, Virginia \u2014 or else find some blue states they can flip to red. That alternative route is what the controversial real estate magnate says he can bring to the table this fall. Trump claims he is bringing in so many new voters to the Republican fold that he can win traditionally blue states, like New Jersey, Michigan or even New York. At a speech earlier this month in Michigan, Trump argued, \"These are states that a normal Republican, because I'm not a normal Republican in any way, a normal Republican cannot think in terms of, frankly, I hate to say this, cannot think in terms of bringing in Michigan.\" White voters are still key for Republicans, and that's who Trump appeals to most. After the 2012 election, the Republican National Committee commissioned a so-called political \"autopsy\" report. It said in order to win the White House again, the GOP had to become more competitive with minority voters, particularly Hispanics. But there were contrarian voices. Even before Trump began his march, some GOP strategists were saying minority outreach is crucial in the long run but not necessarily right away. \"If we are not going to do that, there is a way to win the presidential election by goosing the white vote. The sky is not yet falling. We are on the brink, but we are not there yet,\" said GOP strategist Ford O'Connell. Trump, with his hard-line stands on trade and immigration, might be just the candidate to eke out one more electoral college win thanks to a largely white vote. \"Trump could make the map larger. Because of where he's standing with white voters right now, he would have the Democrats on their heels particularly in the industrial Midwest,\" predicted O'Connell. Even Republicans who are no fans of Trump admit it may be possible. \"l see Donald Trump as a wrecking ball,\" said Ari Fleischer, a former White House press secretary for George W. Bush and one of the co-authors of the RNC's 2012 autopsy. \"He's currently swinging through the Republican Party, and destroying our positions on entitlement reform and on free trade.\" \"But like all wrecking balls, he's going to swing in another direction too, and that will be going through the Democratic Party, wrecking their support among traditional blue-collar, working-class voters,\" Fleischer continued. \"That's the Donald Trump that we've seen so far. He changes everything.\" For Democrats, demographics cut both ways. Democratic pollster Stan Greenberg has studied blue-collar white voters since the 1980s. Back then, he wanted to find out why these voters switched from his party to the GOP. Now, more than three decades later, Greenberg wonders if the story of Trump could be called \"The Revenge of the Reagan Democrats.\" \"The Reagan Democrats are alive with the angry white male who've made themselves felt in the Trump primaries,\" the Democratic pollster acknowledged. But, Greenberg said, there's a big unknown variable still: \"The question is: Are there enough of them, and what's the price of trying to reach them?\" There's no question the white working-class vote is shrinking. Non-college-educated voters were about half of the electorate in 1992. Now they make up a third. But in Rust Belt states like Wisconsin, Ohio and Pennsylvania, they still make up half of eligible voters. Those voters are exactly Trump's base, but turning them out won't be easy. In the last election, white non-college-educated voters had a turnout rate of about 57 percent, while 80 percent of white college-educated voters showed up. Ultimately, Trump would need an unprecedented turnout among these voters. Some analysts calculate that Trump would need at least 65 percent of the white vote to win; 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney got 59 percent. \"He would have to pull a rabbit out of the hat to do this,\" Brookings Institution demographer William Frey said of Trump. \"The demography is against him in a lot of the country, even though we see these huge crowds coming out at his rallies.\" Trump himself is a big motivator, but he cuts both ways. Yes, he has been able to attract thousands (he says millions) of new voters to the GOP primaries, but in a general election he'd also motivate his opponents. For every white working-class male Trump turns out in the Rust Belt, he could also bring out a college-educated suburban woman and a newly registered Latino to vote against him in another part of the country. \"The problem with the theory and the strategy is that, I think almost immediately, you'll see other states like Florida, Virginia, Colorado, Nevada \u2014 states that have had a growth of both ethnic diversity, immigrant diversity but also a rise of cosmopolitan, well-educated populations,\" Greenberg said, \"and those voters don't like Donald Trump.\" Ultimately, Democrats aren't sure what to think. For every bit of Democratic schadenfreude at the GOP's current disarray, there's an equal amount of anxiety about Trump's potential in the fall. David Plouffe, who was President Obama's former chief strategist, told Politico's Glenn Thrush recently that Trump is still a wild card. \"You just don't know,\" Plouffe said in Politico's \"Off Message\" podcast. \"In Virginia, I think Trump would, in a general election, do very, very poorly in Northern Virginia. But does he over-perform Romney and [2008 nominee John] McCain, for instance, and even Bush in the southwestern part of the state? He could. We just don't know.\" So far, Democrats and Republicans are left asking the same question: If Donald Trump has broken all the rules of politics so far, why couldn't he break some more?",

            "article_content": "Donald Trump has a clear if not guaranteed path to the GOP nomination, but could he win the White House? NPR explains what would have to happen in the battle for electoral college votes for him to succeed.  ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: Donald Trump's path to the Republican nomination appears to be pretty straight if he is the GOP nominee. What about his path to a majority in the electoral college? Well, here's NPR's national political correspondent Mara Liasson. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: In every one of the past six presidential elections, Democrats have won states that add up to about 240 electoral votes - not far from the 270 it takes to win. Repubicans have won only about 103 electoral votes. So a republican nominee has to win all the big battleground states or flip some blue states red, and that's just what Donald Trump says he can do in New Jersey, Michigan, even New York. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DONALD TRUMP: These are states that a normal Republican - 'cause I'm not a normal Republican in any way... (CHEERING) TRUMP: But a normal Republican cannot think in terms - frankly, I hate to say this - cannot think in terms of brining in Michigan. LIASSON: The Republican Party certainly hasn't. After the 2012 election, the RNC commissioned a report nicknamed the autopsy which said to win the White House again, the GOP had to become more competitive with minority voters, particularly Hispanics. GOP strategist Ford O'Connell says yes, that kind of outreach is important in the long run, but... FORD O'CONNELL: If we are not going to do that, there is a way to win the presidential election by goosing the white vote. The sky is not yet falling. We are on the brink, but we are not there yet. LIASSON: And now, along comes Donald Trump with his hardline stance on trade and immigration. O'Connell says Trump might be just the candidate to eke out one more electoral college win with a largely white vote. O'CONNELL: He could make the map larger. Because of where he's standing with white voters right now, he would have the Democrats on their heels, particularly in the industrial Midwest. LIASSON: Ari Fleischer, former George W. Bush press secretary and an author of the autopsy report, thinks it's possible. ARI FLEISCHER: Well, I see Donald Trump as a wrecking ball that he's currently swinging through the Republic party and destroying our positions on entitlement, reform and on free trade. But like all wrecking balls, he's going to swing in another direction, too, and that will be going through the Democratic Party, wrecking their support among traditional blue-collar working-class voters. That's the Donald Trump that we've seen so far. He changes everything. LIASSON: Democratic pollster Stan Greenberg has a studied blue-collar white voters since the 1980s. Back then, he wanted to find out why these voters switched from the Democrats to the GOP. Now Greenberg wonders if the story of Trump could be called the revenge of the Reagan Democrats. STAN GREENBERG: The Reagan Democrats are alive with the angry white male voters who've made themselves felt in the Trump primaries. And the question is, are there enough, and what's the price of trying to reach them? LIASSON: We know the white working-class vote is shrinking. Non-college educated voters were about half the electorate in 1992. Now they're only about a third. But in Rust Belt states like Wisconsin, Ohio and Pennsylvania, they make up 50 percent of eligible voters. Still, says Brookings Institution demographer Bill Frey, Trump's voters are hard to turn out. BILL FREY: In the last election, white non-college persons in the electorate turned out at about 57 percent. White-college parts of the electorate turned out at about 80 percent. That's a big difference, right? LIASSON: Frey says Trump would need an unprecedented turnout among these voters. FREY: He would have to pull a rabbit out of the hat (laughter) to do this. The demography is against him in a lot of the country even though we see these huge crowds coming out at his rallies. LIASSON: Donald Trump is a big motivator for his own voters and for his opponents. For every white working-class male he turns out in the Rust Belt, he could also bring out a college-educated suburban woman and a newly registered Hispanic to vote against him elsewhere - Stan Greenberg. GREENBERG: The problem with the theory and the strategy is that I think almost immediately, you'll see other states like Florida, Virginia, Colorado, Nevada, states that have had a growth of both ethnic diversity, immigrant diversity but also a rise of cosmopolitan, well-educated populations. And those voters don't like Donald Trump. LIASSON: Democrats aren't sure what to think. For every bit of Democratic schadenfreude at the GOP's disarray, there's an equal amount of anxiety about Trump's potential. Here's David Plouffe, President Obama's former chief strategist, talking to POLITICO's Glenn Thrush on a recent podcast. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DAVID PLOUFFE: Trump is a wildcard, and you just don't know. And even in Virginia, I think Trump would, in a general election, do very, very poorly in Virginia. But does he over perform Romney and McCain, for instance, in the Southwestern part of the state? He could. GLENN THRUSH: I guess it depends... PLOUFFE: We just don't know. LIASSON: So Democrats and Republicans are asking the same question. If Donald Trump has broken every rule of politics so far, why couldn't he break some more? Mara Liasson, NPR News, Washington.

            "article_content": "Tuesday's primary contests may be the last real chance for Donald Trump's opponents to seriously harm his march to the GOP presidential nomination.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: In today's primaries, two candidates face intense pressure - Ohio Governor John Kasich and Florida Senator Marco Rubio. Each is trying to win his home state tonight, and a loss could mean the end of the road for their campaigns. If Kasich and Rubio succeed tonight, it would go a long way towards keeping Donald Trump from clinching the Republican nomination. We're hearing about the state of the Democratic race elsewhere in the program. For a look at the Republicans, we're joined now by NPR's Sarah McCammon who's in Palm Beach, Fla. Hi, Sarah. SARAH MCCAMMON, BYLINE: Hi there. SHAPIRO: And also by NPR's Don Gonyea who is here in the studio in Washington. Hey, Don. DON GONYEA, BYLINE: Greetings. SHAPIRO: Sarah, let's start with you in Florida. This is the biggest prize in the Republican race, awarding all of its 99 delegates to the winner. How do things look on the ground there? MCCAMMON: You know, on paper, Marco Rubio should have been able to win this state. It's his home state. But he's never had a lead in the polls here. Trump has been way ahead in the polls for a long time. So Rubio's been trying to make up ground promising his supporters a big surprise today. But, you know, if he doesn't win, it's not clear he has a path forward. If Trump does win, you know, he picks up a lot of delegates but not just that - bragging rights that he can win in a big, important state like Florida with a sitting senator on the same ballot. And, you know, in a race where the goal is to get a little more than 1,200 delegates, getting 99 from a single state really helps. SHAPIRO: Now, Don, you're just back from the other big winner-take-all state tonight. That's Ohio. What do things look like there? GONYEA: Well, it's home-field advantage for John Kasich, the sitting governor. The catch, though, is when you have home-field advantage, you better win (laughter). SHAPIRO: High expectations. GONYEA: Exactly, so - but here's what Kasich has going for him on that score - two convincing wins as governor. He has a political machine, a ground game, people in every county, people in every single precinct. So he's going to get turnout with all of that. And he has been working it, working it, working it - rallies in every corner of the state. Still, the polls tell us it is really, really close between him and Donald Trump. And Trump is making a pitch for working-class white voters. There are a lot of those in Ohio. He made a last-minute visit last evening to Youngstown - a lot of working-class - white working-class voters there and kind of as good of a symbol of the Rust Belt as you'll find anyplace so. SHAPIRO: And Kasich has really been drawing a contrast with Trump striking a very different tone from any of the other Republican candidates in the race. Talk about that. GONYEA: Absolutely. First, he presents himself as a conservative, as a commonsense conservative who knows how to govern, you know? He's got this time as governor, and the state is doing well. He was in Congress, and he worked on a balanced budget - remember that. He talks about that a lot. But the other thing he talks about and he takes great pride in the fact that he says he has never gotten into the gutter. He has never taken cheap shots. He was asked about that after voting this morning in Westerville, Ohio. It's a Columbus suburb. And he said he does not regret never having taken the low road. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JOHN KASICH: By the fact that I ran a positive campaign or our team has run a positive campaign, that there were probably missed opportunities to get attention early on. But by continuing to run the race, the positive campaign is now starting to shine through like a beacon all over the county. GONYEA: Here's what he did say, though - he said he is prepared to start going hard after Donald Trump on some of Trump's statements on women and minorities. He said it won't be the low road, but it's going to get tough. SHAPIRO: The candidate running second to Trump in the delegate count so far is Ted Cruz. And, Sarah McCammon, you have followed the Cruz campaign pretty closely. He's trailing Trump, I think, by 99 delegates at this point. What's he looking to accomplish tonight? MCCAMMON: The Cruz campaign say, you know, he's competing everywhere. And it doesn't look like he can win Ohio or Florida, but he does want to show strength in these states. And he's really looking to states that vote today that divide up their delegates rather than winner take all - so Missouri, North Carolina and Illinois. The strategy is to pick up delegates wherever he can. Even if he doesn't beat Trump, keep things competitive. And, you know, unlike Rubio and Kasich who seem to be looking to put a big obstacle in Trump's way, Cruz says he's fighting to actually win the nomination outright. SHAPIRO: And, Don, if we wake up tomorrow and Donald Trump has swept all of these contests, where does that leave the Republican race? GONYEA: It's going to feel like it's over. At the very least, it's then a two- person race going forward with Trump and Ted Cruz. SHAPIRO: That's NPR's Don Gonyea and Sarah McCammon, both following the Republican presidential race. And we will be checking in with you both as results come in tonight. Thanks. GONYEA: Thank you. MCCAMMON: Thanks. Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "Bernie Sanders is looking to keep up his momentum from his win over Hillary Clinton in Michigan last week as five more large states vote on Tuesday.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: Another big primary day is here. Five states and one U.S. territory are voting today for their nominee for president. Four candidates remain in the Republican field. We'll get to them later in the program. Democrats are choosing between Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton. NPR's Tamara Keith and Sam Sanders have spent the last few days with the Democratic candidates, and they both join us now - good to have you both here. SAM SANDERS, BYLINE: Thank you. SHAPIRO: Let's start... TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Glad to be here. SHAPIRO: ...With you, Sam. Bernie Sanders pulled off a surprising upset last Tuesday with the win in Michigan. How is he hoping to capitalize on that win tonight? SANDERS: So he's pushing a message that worked there in Michigan, this appeal to working-class white voters on trade. He directly blames global trade deals like NAFTA and CAFTA and the TPP for millions of job losses throughout the Midwest. SHAPIRO: He wants that message to take hold in states that seem similar to Michigan that are... SANDERS: Exactly. SHAPIRO: ...Voting tonight. SANDERS: Yes, states like Ohio, to a certain extent, Missouri, as well. SHAPIRO: He's also had some pretty harsh words for Donald Trump lately. SANDERS: Yeah. You know, there's been this back and forth between him an Trump since Friday after Trump's Chicago rally was canceled due to protesters. Some of those protesters had signs with Sanders' name. Some were chanting Bernie. So Trump says that Sanders sent them, and Sanders says that he did not do that and that Trump's a liar. So they're in that back-and-forth, and Sanders has also been hitting Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel very hard as well. He's been under fire for his handling of police brutality for months now, and the thought is that Sanders can use that to appeal to black voters. SHAPIRO: Sam, hang on for a second. We're going to turn to Tamara Keith who is in Florida with the Clinton campaign. And Tam, how are people feeling down there today? KEITH: Well, they think that there's a very real chance that Hillary Clinton could lose in some of these states in the Midwest. And it's not clear how many of those states it would be - maybe one or maybe all three. It's also not clear whether they're doing that lowering of expectations thing. Clinton was campaigning today in North Carolina, and she spoke briefly with reporters. And one idea that she kept coming back to in this conversation was that people actually need to go out and vote, which is a very Bernie Sanders thing to say, that it's all about turnout. But Clinton seems concerned that these public polls in basically every state show her up by a big margin, and she's worried that her supporters may think that she has it locked up and that they won't vote for her. They just won't vote, maybe. She, in talking to us, made it very clear that she wants to turn her attention to the Republicans - one particular Republican, Donald J. Trump. (SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE) HILLARY CLINTON: I'm going to keep working as hard as I can, but I think it is important that we really do focus on the very dangerous path that Donald Trump has laid out here. The kind of bluster and bigotry and bullying that he's exemplifying on the campaign trail is disturbing. KEITH: And I have to say she's talking more about Trump these days than she is about her primary opponent, Bertie Sanders. Today, I think the only thing she said about him was that she was very proud of the kind of campaign that they've both been running. SHAPIRO: Now, so far in the states that have voted, we have seen Hillary Clinton perform really well, especially among African-American and older voters. How does that affect states like Florida and North Carolina that are voting today that have large African-American and large elderly populations? KEITH: Yeah. In Florida, 19 percent of the population is over 65 years old according to the latest census data. That is a much higher number than the U.S. average, and older people go big for Hillary Clinton. So do African-Americans, which are a large share of the population in both Florida and North Carolina. She's hoping, expecting to do quite well in those states and actually expects that she could gain a large number of delegates in Florida that would help offset some of those potential Midwestern losses in terms of delegates. SHAPIRO: Potential Midwestern losses - Sam Sanders, as we look up north to Ohio, Illinois, also to Missouri, what do the demographics mean for Bernie Sanders there? SANDERS: Yeah, I mean, so those states have a lower proportion of black voters, and that helps Sanders. He has been doing a bit better with black voters. He got about 30 percent of that vote in Michigan, so his trade message may have worked there. But he still does his best, and his core seems to come from working class white voters, white men, also younger voters. SHAPIRO: That's NPR's Sam Sanders and NPR's Tamara Keith also covering the Democratic candidates. We'll hear from the Republicans elsewhere in the show. Thanks to both of you. KEITH: You're welcome, Ari. SANDERS: Thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.  Visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.

            "article_content": "Hillary Clinton is looking to hold off Bernie Sanders in Tuesday's major primaries, but Sanders is looking for momentum after his surprise win in Michigan last week.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: As Hillary Clinton looks to hold off Bernie Sanders in tomorrow's contests, she has been campaigning today in her home state of Illinois. NPR's Tamara Keith is traveling with the Clinton campaign and joins us now from Springfield. Hi, Tam. TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Hey, Ari. SHAPIRO: What has Secretary Clinton been doing today to avoid another disappointing result tomorrow? KEITH: You know, it's really interesting listening to Sam's story and Bernie Sanders campaigning very much against Hillary Clinton. Hillary Clinton today didn't mention Bernie Sanders and in many ways, her stops felt - you don't want to say this, but more like presidential stops. She stopped at a memorial for children who've been killed in gun violence in Chicago. She did hold a rally at a union hall, it was relatively small. She stopped and met with some union workers, targeting the same working-class folks that Sanders is targeting. She had sort of a series of low-key events. SHAPIRO: Given that that's the nature of the events, what is the nature of her message? I mean, what is she saying to supporters, especially as things are getting more competitive in states that are really important - like Ohio, for example? KEITH: She is in some ways turning her focus to Donald Trump, and talks about the need to unify the party and - as well as unify the country. And she's also asking her supporters to get out there and help her. The supporters I spoke to said that they were concerned that she really could lose in Illinois, which is her home state. Here's what she said. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) HILLARY CLINTON: But do not rest. I mean, if there's an L stop you can go to, if there's a phone call you can make, if there's a door you knock on, if there's a person you convince, please do everything you can in the next 24-plus hours so that we... (APPLAUSE) CLINTON: ...We come out of these elections tomorrow with a wind at our backs. SHAPIRO: And what would it mean, Tam, if tomorrow's results are disappointing for her? KEITH: And let's just say that disappointing would certainly be losing her home state or losing Ohio... SHAPIRO: Sure. KEITH: ...And her campaign is lowering expectations, you could say. And it's always hard to tell whether they are lowering expectations because their expectations are low or if they're lowering expectations because she really could lose (laughter). SHAPIRO: It's the campaign jujitsu there. KEITH: (Laughter) It sure is. But what they are saying is that delegate math remains on her side, you know? It is going to be very difficult for Bernie Sanders to make up this lead that she has among pledged delegates. She has a larger lead among delegates than President Obama ever had, and so she will be just fine even if she loses some of these states narrowly. She's expecting to do quite well in Florida. That's why she's going to be in Florida tomorrow night. She's also going to North Carolina, and she expects to do well in that state, too. So the sense is that she will be OK but Bernie Sanders, if he were to win several of these Midwestern states, would take control of the narrative whether she won more delegates tomorrow night or not. SHAPIRO: Partly because some of these states that are voting tomorrow are not only important for the primaries, but important swing states in a general election, like Ohio and Florida. KEITH: Absolutely important general election swing states. SHAPIRO: That's NPR's Tamara Keith traveling with Hillary Clinton's campaign in Illinois. Thanks, Tam. KEITH: You're welcome, Ari. SHAPIRO: And of course, we will have updates tomorrow night as people vote in those important states - North Carolina, Florida, Ohio, Missouri and Illinois. Stay with us. Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.

ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: After a surprise win over Hillary Clinton in Michigan last Tuesday, Bernie Sanders is looking to do it again tomorrow. Five states hold primary contests. One of them is Ohio. That's where NPR's Sam Sanders is traveling with the Bernie Sanders campaign. SAM SANDERS, BYLINE: Almost a week later, Bernie Sanders still can't stop talking about Michigan. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BERNIE SANDERS: Nobody expected us to have won Michigan last week. Guess what? We won. (CHEERING) S. SANDERS: That was Sanders at a rally in Youngstown, Ohio, Monday morning. He's been riding high and looking ahead to Tuesday's votes. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) B. SANDERS: Guess what? We have a good vote tomorrow. People come out. We're going to win here in Ohio. S. SANDERS: And Sanders in hoping to do that by focusing a lot more on trade. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) B. SANDERS: I want to talk about another difference between Secretary Clinton and myself, a profound and important difference. And that is our disastrous trade policies. S. SANDERS: He's making a pitch to working-class white voters in the Midwest, especially white men who have lost lots of manufacturing and auto jobs over the years. The thinking is that Sanders' opposition to global trade deals like NAFTA and the Trans-Pacific Partnership could help win them over. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) B. SANDERS: NAFTA, CAFTA, permanent normal trade relations with China have cost this country millions of decent-paying jobs. (CHEERING) B. SANDERS: And the key difference between Secretary Clinton and myself is, not only did I vote against every one of these disastrous trade agreements. I helped lead the opposition to them. (CHEERING) S. SANDERS: But for the last few days, Sanders' message on trade has almost been overshadowed by Donald Trump. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DONALD TRUMP: Hey, Bernie. Get your people in line, Bernie. S. SANDERS: Trump's been accusing Bernie Sanders of sending his supporters to disrupt Trump rallies. He started making that claim after a Trump rally was canceled in Chicago last Friday when protesters clashed with Trump supporters. There were protesters chanting Bernie in the crowd in Chicago and holding Bernie Sanders signs, but Sanders has said he didn't send them. Sanders talked about all of this in a CNN town hall. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) B. SANDERS: I hesitate to say this 'cause I really don't like to disparage public officials, but Donald Trump is a pathological liar. (CHEERING, APPLAUSE) B. SANDERS: Our campaign does not believe and never will encourage anybody to disrupt anything. We have millions of supporters. People do what they do. KERRI LONG: I think that it's something to cheer about. S. SANDERS: That's Bernie Sanders supporter Kerri Long. I spoke with her at a Sanders rally in Springfield, Mo., over the weekend, and she said she's glad protesters broke up that Trump rally. LONG: We don't tolerate racism. We don't tolerate bigotry. And if you want to come to certain states and certain cities and speak those things, I think that you're going to find a group of people who won't tolerate it. And if it comes to us peacefully rioting, then that's - or peacefully protesting, then that's what we'll do. S. SANDERS: At a Sanders field office in Ferguson, Mo., Sanders supporter Rachel Johns said pretty much the same thing. RACHEL JOHNS: We actually stand in unison with the people of Chicago. Ultimately, everything was disrupted, you know? And everyone got to express how they felt. S. SANDERS: Johns said she protested during the Trump rally in St. Louis just before Chicago happened. And she said there might be more protests to come. JOHNS: I would definitely do it again (laughter) if I had the opportunity to. S. SANDERS: That might present a challenge as Sanders heads into Tuesday with big races throughout the country. He's trying to turn his supporters' energy into turnout, not protest, but it may be hard to get one without the other. Sam Sanders, NPR News, Youngstown, Ohio. Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.

Sanders hopes his strength with white, working-class men can help him win in Ohio.\n                \n                    \n                    Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Olin Dale Clayton waits for Bernie Sanders before a January event in Iowa with the United Steelworkers Local 310L. Sanders hopes his strength with white, working-class men can help him win in Ohio. When Bernie Sanders won the primary in Michigan last week, it shook up the narrative of the Democratic race. Sanders did so with the help of white men. If he's able to pull off a victory in Ohio, the same demographic will likely be key. Take Jim, who describes himself, only half jokingly, as an angry white man. \"We're pissed off,\" Jim said. (Jim's asked that his last name be withheld because his union, AFSCME, has endorsed Hillary Clinton, and he supports Sanders. He can't be quoted publicly going against his union.) \"We haven't gotten raises. Our pensions have been cut. Our healthcare's increased.\" And, Jim added, Sanders speaks to that. \"Bernie, he speaks from the trenches,\" Jim said. \"We feel that he's fighting for us.\" In Michigan, Sanders won with the support of 62 percent of white men, who were one-in-three voters, according to exit polls. In 2008, in the Democratic primary in Ohio, white men turned out in strikingly similar proportions to this year's Michigan contest. At the same time, black voters could make up a smaller proportion of the electorate and likely won't be enough to put Clinton over the top. In Michigan, Clinton won more than two-thirds of black voters and they were 21 percent of the electorate. In 2008, Barack Obama won nearly 90 percent of black voters in Ohio; they were just 18 percent of the electorate; and Clinton won the state, ironically, with the support of white voters, including white men. Ryan, a member of a building trades union in Cleveland, who also asked NPR not to use his last name because his union has endorsed Clinton, feels the same way as Jim. \"She's [Clinton] seen as the centrist candidate,\" Ryan said. \"And she's a big-money candidate. And big money and centrism hasn't been working for middle-class America for the past 30 years. Since Reagan.\" When Ryan first saw Sanders speak a few months ago, something clicked. He said it was as if a politician was finally saying what Ryan had been thinking about the state of the country. Ryan was so swayed he even sent a small donation to Sanders campaign and later bought a T-shirt. 'Like NASCAR, everyone wear their patch' Sanders won 62 percent of white men in Michigan, while Clinton won 68 percent of blacks. Voters who lived in union households were split between the candidates likely because of black union members.\n                \n                    \n                    Domenico Montanaro/2016, 2008 exit polls\n                    \n                \nhide caption At a union hall in Cleveland, both Jim and Ryan talked about rising health-care costs and trade deals that they believe have hurt much more than they helped. Sanders overwhelmingly won voters in Michigan who thought trade deals cost American jobs \u2014 58 percent of voters said so there, and Sanders won them 2-to-1. (One-in-three Michigan voters said they lived in a household with a union member. Clinton and Sanders split them. Likely accounting for that were black union members who went for Clinton. Those numbers are not split out in exit polls.) Jim said he's only gotten one raise, really more like a cost-of-living adjustment, in eight years. \"You look at the stock market,\" he said, \"it's gone up I don't know how many, a couple of hundred percent. You know, my wages have gone up 2-and-a-half percent. And who's speaking to that? Bernie is. And, yeah, I think maybe he's kind of like Don Quixote. But I mean that's part of the attraction. It really is. At least for me.\" And Jim insists, this isn't about gender. He loves his congresswoman, who incidentally endorsed Sanders on Friday. There are elements of Clinton's stump speech designed to speak to working-class men including the parts where she talks about punishing companies that ship jobs overseas. But it's clear from these interviews that Sanders' attacks on Clinton's trade record, her superPAC, her big money speeches to Wall Street banks \u2014 they are breaking through. The money issue nags at Dave Passalacqua. He likes that Sanders gets his campaign cash from regular people. \"There's that old saying is politicians should be like NASCAR, everyone wear their patch,\" Passalacqua said. \"You know, let's see what the patches are and [Sanders] doesn't need to wear a patch, because it's his own thing.\" 'Pie in the sky' Passalacqua is executive vice president of the Communications Workers of America Local 4340 in Cleveland. His union has endorsed Sanders, but he's still undecided. Passalacqua agreed to meet at a Cleveland diner along with Jim Goggin, a fixture in the city's labor community. He's an organizer for the Delaware Valley Health Care Coalition. \"It's pie in the sky,\" said Goggin, with an unmistakable Irish lilt. \"I mean, everything Bernie says, I think would be fantastic. But the fact of the matter is, that I am also a realist, and I know that you can't do that.\" For Goggin, it is all about beating the Republicans in November. \"And I wish to God that I thought he could win,\" Goggin said. \"But I don't unfortunately think he can win. Consequently, I'm with Hillary, because at least she's not going to throw us under the bus, the working people.\" Passalacqua chimes in: \"And one good thing that Bernie's been doing, though, even with Hillary, is Bernie has moved Hillary's positions on things.\" From the outside, it seems Passalacqua is having a classic voter's struggle between his head and his heart. He isn't convinced Sanders will be able to do what he's promising. Who will he vote for? \"Whoever I think is going best for me and my family is the bottom line. Whoever is going to make \u2014 not to steal Donald's line, but \u2014 America great again,\" said Pasalaqua quoting Donald Trump's catch phrase. \"Because in order to make America great again we've got to make the middle class great again. So whoever's going to do that, I think's going to be the best person. And that's who I'll end up having to vote for.\" No matter how Tuesday's vote turns out, and no matter who wins the nomination, all four men said they would support the Democratic nominee in November.",

If you don't hang out with lawmakers, economists and journalists in Washington, you probably think Democrats and Republicans disagree on economic policy. They don't. In Washington, there's actually a broad consensus about economic growth. These ideas have held sway for decades: Of course, Democrats and Republicans disagree on the details, but the framework has remained solid regardless of who holds power in the White House or Congress. That's why President Obama, a Democrat, and House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Republican, both support the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade deal. It's why Obama says that \"generations of immigrants have made this country into what it is,\" and Ryan says that \"immigrants contribute to our economy.\" It's why Democrat Nancy Pelosi says that \"it is imperative that America continues to lead the world through innovation,\" and Republican Mitch McConnell says that \"the Internet and the rapid adoption of mobile technology have been great American success stories.\" Now, Washington's cozy cocoon of ideas is getting a violent shaking from Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders. Trump, who is running for the Republican presidential nomination, and Sanders who is seeking the Democratic nomination, are very different candidates. One is a billionaire businessman, and the other a democratic socialist. But each is appealing to voters who believe that Washington's economic framework is rotten. The candidates want to tear it down, and millions of working-class Americans agree. The people who helped build that framework are taking note. \"While the U.S. economy is performing well, the electorate remains unconvinced, even angry over how the economy has not performed for them, and their anger is stirred by presidential candidates in both parties,\" Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, said in a written assessment Thursday. To understand what's been happening this presidential primary season, consider Michigan, where voters turned out in huge numbers for Sanders and Trump. According to Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis data, the inflation-adjusted annual median household income in Michigan fell by about $14,000 a year \u2014 down to about $52,000 \u2014 from 1999 to 2014. That same time period played out very differently for corporations. From 1999 to 2014, U.S. annual corporate profits after taxes shot up by about 250 percent, to nearly $1.7 trillion. So, yes, businesses did much better, allowing Washington thought-leaders to, in effect, say: \"See, we were right! We promoted the ideas that have kept America's GDP ranked No. 1 in the world, even though China has four times our population.\" But outside of Washington, millions of Americans are not living in a Big Picture or a Framework. They are living in houses that have lost value, in cities where they don't trust the water pipes and where companies can suddenly announce they are moving jobs to other countries. With their support of Sanders and Trump, those workers have made it clear they want a new paradigm. Trump talks about building a wall to stop immigrants; Sanders talks about breaking up big banks. So their solutions are quite different, but the message is the same: No more business as usual. Many economists say the alternatives would only be worse. They point to Argentina \u2014 it was one of the world's richest nations a century ago. Then it fell behind in technological innovation and education, became politically chaotic and declined dramatically. The only way to improve the lives of average Americans is to encourage them to fit themselves into a technologically advanced, fast-changing, intensely competitive global economy. But other economists are saying Washington does need to rethink its assumptions. Andrew Levin is a Dartmouth economics professor who spent many years in Washington as an economist for the Federal Reserve and for the International Monetary Fund. He said that for decades, economists have been basing their ideas on formulas that showed the free flows of goods, capital and people would maximize wealth. But these days, many are \"recognizing that our models are too simple ... life is more complex,\" Levin said. In other words, economists were right to say more trade could boost wealth, but wrong to assume it would help most workers. As wages have stagnated, \"confidence in the Washington consensus has very much faded over the past 10 years,\" Levin said. So should the Washington consensus change? Yes, \"but you don't want to throw the baby out with the bathwater,\" Levin warned. For example, he said, it would be a big mistake to shut off all trade or return to an obsolete gold standard. Instead, he recommends that economic and policy leaders take smaller steps while re-examining the data. For example, they could decide that \"trade agreements should ensure that the benefits are shared more evenly with American families,\" he said.",

Before Tuesday night, the debate was looking like an unimportant afterthought to a race that could have been all wrapped up. But not anymore, after Sanders' stunningly unexpected win in Michigan last night. Here are three things to watch: Hillary Clinton's campaign says all that matters is delegates and by that measure she succeeded Tuesday night \u2014 increasing her delegate lead over Bernie Sanders. But her loss to Sanders exposed troubling weaknesses for Clinton which she needs to address tonight. How will she try to woo independents (which she lost) and white working class voters (which she almost lost)? Just when pundits were getting ready to call him irrelevant, Sanders is now set up nicely for Ohio \u2014 another big Rust Belt state that votes next Tuesday. Tonight in Miami, will he raise the electability question: If Clinton lost Michigan to a Democratic populist in March, why wouldn't she lose Michigan to a Republican populist (Donald Trump) in November? Republicans keep on posting high turnout levels. Democratic turnout is below 2008 levels. In addition, the news media are inclined to cover a rambling 45-minute infomercial by Trump \u2014 billed as a presidential style news conference \u2014 instead of speeches by the other candidates. If Trump is the nominee and continues to drive ratings, the Democrats might be gasping for airtime this fall.",

            "article_content": "Sanders won Michigan's primary in a stunning upset to Clinton. Sanders exposed Clinton's weaknesses among working class voters on trade issues and delivered on his promise to win with black voters.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: Michigan was the big political story last night. Bernie Sanders defeated Hillary Clinton, a win that he hopes changes the trajectory of the campaign. KELLY MCEVERS, HOST: On the Republican side, Donald Trump won in Michigan. He also took 2 of the 3 other Republican races, increasing his lead over his rivals. SHAPIRO: NPR political editor Domenico Montanaro is here to help us figure out what this all means. Hi again, Domenico. DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Hey there. SHAPIRO: Let's start with the Democrats and that win for Bernie Sanders. Hillary Clinton was expected to take Michigan. All the polls had her winning by huge margins. What happened? MONTANARO: Well, first of all, the polls were wrong (laughter). You know, it's another reminder to take polls with a grain of salt, I mean, especially after those early states where polling can really just be hit or miss, frankly. You know, trade was a big part of this. Sanders' message - he had been saying that trade policies cost jobs. Clearly that broke through. Fifty-eight percent of Democratic voters in Michigan agreed with that. Bernie Sanders won those voters 2 to 1. Sanders won big with white voters - white men in particular - won about two-thirds of those as well as white men without a college degree. And there's been a lot of talk about what Bernie Sanders needs to do. Frankly, Hillary Clinton needs to start showing she can broaden her appeal and start winning some of those blue-collar white voters, you know? But it wasn't just that Sanders won big with whites. He also delivered on this promise that they had to start doing better with black voters. His highest share so far of African-Americans came in Michigan, still, was only 31 percent, but it was enough to keep her below where she needed to be to win. And his campaign banked on the fact that blacks in the North would vote differently than blacks in the South. And last night, at least, that was true. MCEVERS: All right, so that's what happened in Michigan. Domenico, what does this mean for the upcoming contests? MONTANARO: Well, first of all, we should point out that the delegate math is still very tough for Bernie Sanders. Despite his important win in Michigan - it was an important narrative-changing win, potentially - Clinton wound up with the most delegates out of the night because of this huge margin that she won out of Mississippi. Almost half the country has voted, and Clinton now has a 200-delegate lead. But anyway, Michigan looks a lot like some of the upcoming contests in big states next week, including Illinois and Ohio. So he's feeling pretty good about that. MCEVERS: All right. Let's talk about Republicans now. There weren't many surprises last night. Donald Trump was expected to do well, and he did. So how did that happen? MONTANARO: Well, you know, it's really fascinating with Donald Trump. He's able to kind of pick off different parts of the electorate that some of his rivals were supposed to be strong with. For example, in Mississippi, he won evangelicals - white evangelicals, who were 3 in 4 in the Republican primary. They were supposed to be Ted Cruz voters. They wound up going to Trump. Trump also won in the Upper Midwest in Michigan, beating out the popular governor of neighboring Ohio, John Kasich. He wound up finishing third, actually. So that just shows you the kind of broad coalition Trump is trying to build, hoping to sustain. We'll see if the attacks that he has been facing actually do anything to mitigate some of that, but right now, it looks like he's expanding rather than contracting. SHAPIRO: Domenico, I talked to Bernie Sanders earlier today, and he argued that he is not winning Southern states because he's not conservative. MONTANARO: I heard that. SHAPIRO: Yes. (LAUGHTER) SHAPIRO: And he also argued that the states that Hillary Clinton tends to be winning are states that go red in a general election. What do you make of that? Does that matter if the states that you win in the primary are swing states in the general election? MONTANARO: Well, first of all, it's really important to remember here, Ari, that this is a game - this is the game they both signed up for, OK? You can't just say this one state matters and this other state doesn't because an earned delegate in Nebraska counts just as much as that earned delegate in California where they're going to have tons of them. Primary turnout doesn't also indicate general election turnout. People - it's a spin you hear every four years. It just doesn't hold up. If it were the case, Barack Obama wouldn't have won Pennsylvania, Ohio or Indiana in 2008 because guess who won there - Hillary Clinton. She won that primary. But guess what did happen? Barack Obama won the general election, as we all know, and won those states. SHAPIRO: So you're saying narrative matters; delegates matter more. Is that the takeaway here? MONTANARO: It's always math versus momentum because the math matters until the momentum can take over. And that's the argument the Sanders campaign is making. Unfortunately, when you look at the math - and you've presented this to him in that interview as well - even if he gets big majorities in some of these states where he feels like he can do well, in the pledged majority - in the pledged delegates, he's still... SHAPIRO: So not even talking about superdelegates... MONTANARO: Not even superdelegates, he would still need a majority of those pledged delegates because people have actually started to vote. MCEVERS: That's NPR's Domenico Montanaro. Thank you so much. MONTANARO: Hey, thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton currently lead the delegate counts for the presidential nomination. But because of the difference in how both parties award their delegates, Clinton's is the more commanding lead. Tuesday's Democratic contest in Michigan, the biggest prize of the day, is key for Bernie Sanders to show he can turn things around. His campaign has argued that Clinton has ballooned her lead because of black voters in the South. Now, many of those Southern contests are over (though there is another Tuesday in Mississippi). But the question remains: Can the Vermont independent senator appeal to Northern black voters? They make up roughly a quarter of Michigan's Democratic electorate. He believes his economic message can resonate with them and working-class whites hurt by trade. Polls, though, have shown the former secretary of state with double-digit leads going into Tuesday. Sanders is facing a difficult problem: This past weekend, he won three of four contests, but, because his wins were in smaller caucuses, and Clinton won by a huge margin in the primary in Louisiana, Sanders only wound up winning three more pledged delegates than Clinton. (Pledged delegates are derived from the margins candidates win in voting in various state primaries and caucuses.) Maintaining that kind of pace will not help Sanders catch Clinton, who is 195 delegates ahead. Sanders needs 53 percent of all remaining delegates to win a majority of pledged delegates. And with each passing contest, that hill becomes even steeper. With superdelegates, those unpledged party leaders and elected officials, factored in, Sanders needs a whopping 60 percent of all remaining delegates. That's a very difficult aircraft carrier to turn around, given the Democrats' proportional system of allocating delegates. Hillary Clinton speaks at the Charles H. Wright Museum of African American History in Detroit. She again hopes black support pushes her over the top in Michigan.\n                \n                    \n                    Charlie Neibergall/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Hillary Clinton speaks at the Charles H. Wright Museum of African American History in Detroit. She again hopes black support pushes her over the top in Michigan. Yes, superdelegates can change their votes, and it's true they have never not gone with who won the pledged majority, but even in 2008, when Barack Obama defeated Clinton, and won more superdelegates, not all that many superdelegates peeled off from Clinton. What's more, Clinton has a far bigger lead with them now than she ever did in 2008. Clinton already has nearly two-thirds of all superdelegates publicly in her corner. (And, by the way, they were created in the 1980s for precisely this purpose \u2014 to give party leaders a lever to prevent the nomination of what they view as an unelectable candidate after Democrats were soundly defeated in 1984.) All that said, the pledged-delegate margin remains the most important number to watch. Clinton would prefer to win the nomination outright based on voting \u2014 and not because party leaders put her over the top. There's lots of talk of the GOP civil war, but if there was an outcome in which one candidate won the delegates from actual voters and the other won the nomination because of party insiders, you can bet there would be an equally ugly Democratic convention in Philadelphia this summer. But unless Sanders starts winning soon and big, that's all theoretical and moot. The Democratic race, at this point, doesn't look close to heading toward anything like that. Donald Trump speaks during a rally at Macomb Community College in Michigan.\n                \n                    \n                    Scott Olson/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Donald Trump speaks during a rally at Macomb Community College in Michigan. For Republicans, though, Trump is ahead, his lead is less dominant because it's a four-person race \u2014 and the candidates keep splitting the vote. On Tuesday, Michigan has the most delegates in play with 59, far less than on the Democratic side, in part because Republicans have far fewer delegates overall, but also because of the state's history of voting Democratic. Trump has been leading the polls there by double digits, and he needs another big win. The other contests of the day, though \u2014 in Mississippi, Idaho and Hawaii \u2014 hold far more delegates combined (91) than Michigan. There hasn't been any good polling in Mississippi, but Trump hopes to pull off a win there like he did in neighboring Louisiana over the weekend. If Louisiana is an indicator, though, Cruz could give Trump a run for his money. If Cruz pulled that off, it would be yet another example that he could use to say he's the principal alternative to Trump \u2014 and not Marco Rubio. This past weekend, Cruz, who trails Trump by 84 delegates, made a strong case for that. He won the biggest share of the delegates out of a handful of contests with wins in Kansas and Maine \u2014 and he nearly picked off Trump in Louisiana and Kentucky. Rubio finished third everywhere on Saturday, except in Maine, where he finished fourth. He made up for it some in Puerto Rico on Sunday, winning there by such a big margin that he took all of the territory's 23 delegates. The GOP political establishment couldn't think of a worse possible choice than having to pick between Trump and Cruz, who might be the least liked person in Congress among his colleagues. And then there's John Kasich. The Ohio governor is hoping to surprise the field in Michigan. He should do well there. He's a Midwesterner. But he's polling double digits behind Trump, and some polls have had Cruz either in second or a close third. If Kasich is far behind in Michigan or even finishes third behind Cruz, it's hard for him to make a case that he has a real chance at the nomination. He'll likely stay in for the winner-take-all March 15 contest in his home state of Ohio, but what's his sell for staying in after that \u2014 aside from maybe trying to keep Trump below a majority heading into the convention by picking off votes and delegates where he can in more moderate places? Because of the crowded field, unlike the two-person race on the Democratic side, Trump currently still needs 53 percent of all remaining delegates to win the nomination. But he has only won the majority of delegates in five of 20 states so far. That's not to say anyone else on the GOP side has a better chance of winning a majority \u2014 Cruz needs 59 percent of all remaining delegates, Rubio 68 percent and Kasich 75 percent. The candidates hope to start racking up more lopsided wins, as the contest rules change on March 15. That's when states can pick however they want to award delegates. Some states, like Florida, Ohio, Arizona and New Jersey, are winner take all; others are more hybrid. All of that is to say there could be some funky results, spikes and dips ahead that could sway the race in a potentially unknown direction. But clearly, at this point, Trump is in the driver's seat. He has solid support with his hardened base that will get him a lot of delegates before June when the contests are eventually over. The question that still remains for him is: Will he grow his support? Through 20 contests, he has averaged 35 percent of the vote. He's cracked 40 percent in five states so far and 50 percent in just one (New Hampshire). That's why he's been publicly calling for candidates, like Rubio, to get out of the race. The theory of the establishment coalescing behind a single candidate to beat Trump might not hold true, but what might be true is Trump needs the field to shrink to get a majority before the convention. By Barbara Sprunt and Domenico Montanaro How many states vote? Four: Hawaii, Idaho, Michigan and Mississippi. (All four vote on the GOP side, but just Michigan and Mississippi vote on the Democratic side.) When do polls close? 8 p.m. ET (Mississippi), 9 p.m. ET (Michigan \u2014 most polls close at 8 p.m. ET, but some counties are in Central), 11 p.m. ET (Idaho), 1 a.m. ET (Hawaii). How many delegates are at stake? 316 combined (338 if 22 Democratic superdelegates are included): -- 188 Democrats (Michigan: 130 pledged+17 supers; Mississippi: 36 pledged+5 supers) \u2014 150 Republican (Michigan: 59; Mississippi: 40; Idaho: 32; Hawaii: 19) Remind me what happened on Super Tuesday? Trump won big, picking up victories in Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Massachusetts, Tennessee, Vermont and Virginia. Cruz won his home state of Texas and also Oklahoma and Alaska. Marco Rubio eked out his first victory \u2014 in the Minnesota caucuses. That was enough to guarantee that both senators would be in the race until at least March 15, when more states become winner-take-all, including Rubio's must-win home state of Florida. For the Democrats, Clinton won Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Massachusetts, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia. Sanders won Colorado, Minnesota, Oklahoma and his home state of Vermont. Did anything happen after Super Tuesday? Yes. On the Democratic side, Sanders won the caucuses in Maine, Kansas and Nebraska. Clinton won by a huge margin in the Louisiana primary. On the GOP side, Cruz won the most delegates out of this past weekend with wins in Kansas and Maine on Saturday. Trump pulled off narrow victories in Louisiana and Kentucky. Rubio won the Republican primary in Puerto Rico on Sunday by more than 50 percent of the vote, giving him all 23 delegates (which, by the way, is as many delegates as in New Hampshire). What is the current delegate count? On the GOP side, Trump has 384 delegates. In second place is Cruz with 300. Rubio has 151 and Kasich 37. Remember, the Republicans need 1,237 delegates to get the nomination. On the Democratic side, Clinton leads with pledged delegates 672 to 477 for Sanders. With superdelegates factored in (458 for Clinton), her total balloons to 1,130 to Sanders' 499 (with just 22 superdelegates).",

            "article_content": "Michigan's presidential primary is on Tuesday. Donald Trump looks to have strong support from the state's white working class voters, but John Kasich is campaigning hard there.  KELLY MCEVERS, HOST: The presidential primary season is far from over. Four states vote tomorrow, including Republican contests in Idaho and Hawaii. Both parties vote in Mississippi, and the biggest prize for Republicans and Democrats tomorrow is in Michigan, so that's where we're going to go to now. We'll start with a look at the Republican race with NPR's Don Gonyea. He's in Grosse Pointe Woods, Mich., where Ohio Gov. John Kasich just wrapped up an event. Hi there, Don. DON GONYEA, BYLINE: Hi, Kelly. MCEVERS: All right, so let's start with Kasich. He's the popular governor of the neighboring state. He's not picking up so much traction in recent polls. Is he trying to emulate the front runner Donald Trump like other candidates have done, or is he sticking to his own message? GONYEA: He is not. Others have gone toe-to-toe with Trump, trading insults and trading personal attacks and all that. Not Kasich. He couldn't be less like Trump in the way he's campaigning. And let's be clear, Kasich's reputation - he is hardly the prince of sweetness and light, you know? He can be brusque, he'll snap at reporters, but while campaigning he focuses on his record, his accomplishments as governor. No personal attacks, no insults. He'll go after an opponent's record, but in a way that he says is befitting the office that they're seeking. MCEVERS: All right, so we're talking about, though, distinguishing oneself from Donald Trump. Ted Cruz scheduled a last-minute return to Michigan. He's gotten some momentum coming out of the weekend, where he won a couple of contests. Is he finding a receptive audience in Michigan? GONYEA: He's popular. Christian conservatives like him, evangelicals like him, the tea party likes him, and there's a lot of those here. He argues that it's already a two-person race, that he's the conservative base's best alternative to Trump. He is a somewhat distant second in polls here to Trump. And Kasich is rising a little bit, getting close to Cruz. But again, Cruz hasn't been here. No events here since Super Tuesday except for the one that he'll have tonight in Grand Rapids. MCEVERS: It seems like one of the reasons that Trump does have the support is he's getting it white working-class voters. What are these other candidates hoping to pull off then? GONYEA: Well, Cruz hopes that the damage from all of the attacks Trump has been taking will finally start to show tomorrow. And, you know, there's talk that floats around about - it's going to have to be a contested convention for anybody other than Trump to win. Cruz folks dismiss that. They think they'll be ahead in delegates, and they think that's, like, a trick to steal the nomination from Ted Cruz. John Kasich, however, told reporters today that it looks like - he thinks that's where this is headed, to a contested convention. He sees nothing wrong with it. He says if you don't get the needed delegates, the 1,237, in advance, it's not like you have a claim on it. Give a listen. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JOHN KASICH: When it comes to a convention it's like in order to be the nominee, you have to have a certain number of votes. Not like a plurality. You've got to have a certain number. It's like - you know, it's like anything else in life. There's certain rules. I mean, you go take a driving test - if you don't pass the driving test, you don't get your license. It's not like, you know, well, that's good enough for government. So if - you've got to win. GONYEA: We should add here that the only hope for Kasich and for Marco Rubio is that, you know, Kasich wins Ohio, Rubio wins Florida, Kasich does well in Michigan, and that they have indeed denied Donald Trump the necessary delegates. MCEVERS: All right, well, we should say that Trump is still very strong there in Michigan. Why is that so? GONYEA: It's a big state, an open primary, big media markets, lots of working-class voters who are frustrated and worried about the economy. And they are very, very angry at Washington, and Donald Trump is the guy who's speaking to them. MCEVERS: That's NPR's Don Gonyea. Thanks so much. GONYEA: Thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.

            "article_content": "Voters in about a dozen states are going to the polls Today. On the Democratic side, Hillary Clinton is looking to gain a sizable lead in delegates over Bernie Sanders. But Sanders has been focusing on peeling off victories in some key states.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: In the presidential nominating contest, there is more up for grabs tonight than any other day. We are checking in on the campaigns of all the major candidates. We're hearing about the Republicans elsewhere in the show. Now to our reporters covering the Democrats. NPR's Tamara Keith is traveling with Hillary Clinton's campaign. She's in Miami. Hey, Tam. TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Hey. SHAPIRO: And NPR's Sam Sanders is following the Bernie Sanders campaign - no relation. That puts him in Vermont in the town of Essex Junction. Hey there, Sam. SAM SANDERS, BYLINE: Hey there. SHAPIRO: Start by telling us where Bernie Sanders is looking to pull off some wins tonight. SANDERS: So he's been campaigning all over the place these past few days - Colorado and Minnesota, Massachusetts, Texas and Oklahoma. But he's most hopeful for wins in Oklahoma, Vermont and Minnesota. Also got to point out, in Sanders' stump speeches there's been a shift in tone. His camp was just saying that he hopes to do well, not saying which states they think they'll win forthright. And in recent days, he's been hitting Clinton very hard on her ties to Wall Street, her vote for the war in Iraq. He's gotten tough. SHAPIRO: Tam, Hilary Clinton is expected to do really well tonight. So what are you looking for in the results? KEITH: I'm looking at Minnesota. She went there today and did a couple of events. And I don't know if she thinks she could actually win Minnesota, but I think she's definitely looking in - to cut into Sanders' margin of victory. Massachusetts - polls showed Bernie Sanders ahead. Now they show Clinton ahead, and so that's an open question as to how that will turn out. And, really, for Clinton, it's not about the number of wins. It's more about how big a margin these wins will be. This is a fight for delegates, and even if she can't win, she's looking to pick up delegates in states, even possibly including Vermont. But especially in southern states, that margin is going to be important and the big question, the big thing we're looking for is how well she does with African-American voters, how much better than Senator Sanders she does. SHAPIRO: Sam, how is Senator Sanders approaching that question, yeah, of African-American voters. SANDERS: Yeah. He's basically stopped trying to get black voters. He admits he was, quote, \"decimated\" in South Carolina. And if you look at the states that he's been going to these, like, past few days, he's been banking on the working-class white vote now. SHAPIRO: If Bernie Sanders does not do well tonight, Sam, what does that mean for his campaign going forward? SANDERS: So in Boston yesterday, he said that every state deserves the chance to pick the candidate of their choice. So basically he plans to be in this thing for the long haul regardless of what happens tonight. And it seemed like he can do that. He's raised lots of money - $6 million yesterday, $40 million last month - and that's with no super PAC and no big donors. His supporters believe in him, and he takes that seriously. He can stay in a lot longer than folks think he can with that money. SHAPIRO: And after the Super Tuesday votes are counted, what is Hillary Clinton's next move, Tam? KEITH: Well, even before then, she's holding her event tonight in Florida, which is a state that votes on March 15. She is already running ads in several states that are voting next week. And so even though it's possible that they could end up with a very strong delegate lead after tonight, they're not done. They even opened a campaign office in Hawaii. But also the Clinton campaign is starting to look ahead. They are starting to allow themselves to think or even worry about the possible Republican nominee. They don't know who it will be, but they are beginning to think about how they might deal with a Donald Trump candidacy. SHAPIRO: And, Tam, do you hear that reflected in her campaign speeches? On the stump, does she sound more like a general election candidate than a primary candidate that she sounded like up until this point? KEITH: Yes. So Sam was talking about how Bernie Sanders has been - continued to be very critical of Hillary Clinton on the stump. Well, Hillary Clinton has barely mentioned Bernie Sanders in recent days, hasn't mentioned him by name, called him her esteemed opponent. And she's also starting not directly but pretty clearly to talk about Donald Trump. She has a new line that's really popular among her supporters in her speech where she says that America is already great. We need to make it whole. She's talking a lot about breaking down barriers. Well, that might be in contrast to somebody who wants to build a giant wall. So she is definitely thinking about Donald Trump. SHAPIRO: That's NPR's Tamara Keith and Sam Sanders following the Democratic side of the presidential race this Super Tuesday. Lots more to come from both of you tonight. Thanks to you both. KEITH: You're welcome. SANDERS: Thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.  Visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.

Saturday night was a great time for victory speeches. The winners in Nevada and South Carolina each gave one. Some of the losers did, too. Two candidates who had been fading in the latest polls came back to win \u2014 and crow about it. Several others who fell short of their hopes still claimed to have exceeded expectations. And on the Republican side, even the fifth and sixth-place finishers claimed to find encouragement to continue their quests. But after many months of campaigning led up to the first three voting events, the next 10 days will bring more than a dozen states where candidates have not been able to spend extensive time campaigning. Those next 10 days may well decide which of these confident Saturday night pronouncements were specious, and which lead on to success at the party conventions in July. Who Really Won? Donald Trump was the only candidate over 30 percent in South Carolina, the state where the GOP primary has picked eight of the party's last nine nominees. Although Trump's huge lead in the polls shrank a bit in the late going, he still won by double digits over the last two senators in the race, Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, who were locked in a virtual tie. Republican Donald Trump won in South Carolina by double digits over Sens. Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, who were locked in a virtual tie.\n                \n                    \n                    Spencer Platt/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Republican Donald Trump won in South Carolina by double digits over Sens. Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, who were locked in a virtual tie. Trump gave an expansive and triumphant speech, even passing the mic around to family members. And why not? Trump has now erased memories of the speed bump he hit in Iowa on Feb. 1. And in his victory speech he returned to his theme of winning, and to the immigration issue that has been his lodestar since entering the race. \"We will build a wall and who's gonna pay for it?\" Trump shouted. \"Mexico!\" screamed the crowd. Trump said he had met with a delegation from Mexico who said their country was not at all interested in paying for any wall. \"Guess what?\" Trump shot back. \"That wall just got 10 feet higher.\" The crowd loved it. On the Democratic side, Hillary Clinton finished about 5.5 points ahead of Bernie Sanders. It was an underwhelming margin when compared with her big edge in the polls here last year. On the other hand, it was a most welcome relief after the drubbing Clinton took in New Hampshire on Feb. 9. Winning on Saturday was also a relief because Nevada experts had refused to pick a winner here as the caucuses began on Saturday. The uncertainty on caucus day made her eventual win and modest margin look a lot better. Democratic presidential candidate former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton greets supporters during a caucus day event at Caesers Palace on February 20 in Las Vegas, Nevada.\n                \n                    \n                    Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Democratic presidential candidate former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton greets supporters during a caucus day event at Caesers Palace on February 20 in Las Vegas, Nevada. You could say Clinton benefited from her lowered expectations here, and she herself hit that note at the start in her remarks. \"Some may have doubted us, but we never doubted each other,\" she said. And she proceeded to detail her appeals and plans for the voters who had largely rejected her in the voting in three states so far \u2013 white working class males, and young voters of all races and both genders. \"We're going to build ladders of opportunity in their place so every American can go as far as your hard work can take you, Clinton said. \"This is your campaign, and it is a campaign to break down every barrier that holds you back.  Who Acted Like Winners Anyway? But if Trump and Clinton spoke to the winning occasion, others did as well. After losing by a hair's breadth in Iowa this month, Sanders took the stage to talk about how far he had been behind in that state last summer. After a smashing win in New Hampshire, Sanders took the stage to assay the same theme. And he did so a third time in Las Vegas Saturday night. Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders reacts to the crowd as he arrives at the Henderson Pavilion to give a concession speech on Feb. 20 in Henderson, Nevada.\n                \n                    \n                    Ethan Miller/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders reacts to the crowd as he arrives at the Henderson Pavilion to give a concession speech on Feb. 20 in Henderson, Nevada. \"We have come a very long way in nine months. It is clear to me, and I think most observers, that the wind is on \u2014 at our backs,\" Sanders said. \"We have the momentum. And I believe \u2014 I believe that when Democrats assemble in Philadelphia in July, at that convention, we are going to see the results of one of the great political upsets in the history of the United States.\" Cynics may ask how long Sanders can make a mantra of comparing his vote totals to his awful poll numbers from last year. But his message about rising inequality still has much of its magic, and it has greater force when one notes Sanders reported raising $21 million in the most recent filing period. Clinton managed only $15 million in the same period. On Saturday, Sanders reprised his eye-popping performance among millennials, who again gave him more than 80 percent of their votes. But the younger voters were outpolled in Nevada by those over 45. The middle-aged and older voters preferred Clinton, especially those over 65. Clinton also tallied nearly 60 percent among those who identified as Democrats. Sanders won the voters who said they were independents or Republicans. That distinction could begin to pinch in states that only let the Democrats vote in the Democratic primary. Rubio, Cruz In Dead Heat Much like Sanders, Rubio has been turning a mixed bag of results into a victory speech on a weekly basis. Saturday night was no exception, as he finished second (or tied for second with Cruz). Falling 10 points behind the winner put no damper on Rubio's post-action summation. \"After tonight this has become a three-person race, and we will win the nomination!\" said Rubio, taking the stage with his wife and children and his brace of backers, Sen. Tim Scott and Gov. Nikki Haley. Cruz was the last of the major candidates to speak. He came to the stage with a posse of conservative members of Congress and religious leaders, as well as his wife and two daughters. \"Friends, once again, we have made history,\" Cruz said. \"You, the good people of South Carolina and our incredible volunteers all over the country, continue to defy the pundits and to produce extraordinary results.\" Candidates Out Of Money Three candidates wound up with little to show for the immense investment in South Carolina. One, John Kasich, echoed Rubio saying the contest was now a three-person race. But in Kasich's formulation, there was still room for four \u2014 including himself. Kasich will probably campaign through March 15, when his home state of Ohio votes. He can also claim now to be the last survivor of a half-dozen current or former governors who were part of the original field. Also on the ropes but vowing to carry on was Dr. Ben Carson, the pediatric neurosurgeon who emerged from early debates as a fascinating first-time candidate and political neophyte. His poll numbers dwindled after the Nov. 13 terror attacks in Paris refocused the campaign issue mix. That left the man who had begun the process last summer with the biggest war chest and the fullest resume of government service, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. Scion of the nation's leading Republican dynasty, Bush seemed to need only to acquiesce and watch him stroll to the nomination. He easily outraised all other candidates in 2015. But Bush descended in the polls after a series of lackluster showings in the televised candidate debates. By the time the voting came in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, Bush was off the A-list. \"I respect their decisions, and tonight I am suspending my campaign,\" said Jeb, the man some once thought the premier political talent in his famous family. The last time the Republican Party won the White House without someone named Bush on their ticket was 1972. This year, it appears they will get to try again. Where Do We Go From Here? Next week, Sanders can expect to take a beating in South Carolina, where Clinton remains in the driver's seat. She benefits there from the predominance of the African-American vote, which she won 3-1 in Nevada. That should set up a Super Tuesday in which Clinton rides a steady dominance among black voters to win in the South. Sanders will be better positioned in Minnesota, Massachusetts and his own home state of Vermont. After commanding performances in New Hampshire and South Carolina, Trump can expect to dominate the rather small-scale GOP caucus in Nevada next week and sweep his earnings into the 12-state extravaganza on March 1 that's called Super Tuesday. It's difficult to see how either Cruz or Rubio can overtake him so long as they're locked in a mutual chokehold. Rubio can of course claim now to be the establishment candidate of choice. His last rival for this lane, John Kasich, will not likely be viable in the Southern states on Super Tuesday, but he should compete in the four or five primaries outside the region. But even if Kasich were to drop, would Rubio inherit Bush's entire vote? Perhaps, and the Florida connection helps. But Rubio has made no friends in the Bush clan during this contest and his rather condescending salute to his former mentor on Saturday night may not be enough to heal that wound. Cruz, for his part, is still the top choice for those who tell exit pollsters they are \"very conservative.\" But as he mines this rich vein, he finds himself sharing it with Trump, who ran strong among both the \"very conservative\" and the self-described \"born again Evangelical\" voters in South Carolina.",

NPR explores the impact these voters may have on the campaign.  AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: Tonight's the night when voters finally take the spotlight in the 2016 presidential contest. Voters in Iowa will file into schools, community centers, libraries and even living rooms to speak up for their candidates. NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson is here to talk about what tonight may mean for these campaigns. Hey there, Mara. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Hi, Audie. CORNISH: OK, so potentially significant headlines that could come out of Iowa tonight - what do you think? LIASSON: Here my three. Trump is for real. Trump is a loser. And the third one is, Bernie wins. Now, you can see two of the headlines were about Trump. CORNISH: Right. LIASSON: But they were for opposite outcomes, but that's because everything about his campaign has been completely unexpected. The big question about him was could he turn his supporters - and there are a lot of them - into actual voters? We wouldn't ask this question about a normal, ordinary candidate, but because he's been so unorthodox, that's been a big question. And then the Trump is a loser - Trump's whole campaign is based on winning everything - every poll, every debate. Everything is the biggest, best, most fantastic. If he loses Iowa, he's a loser. How will he react to that? And the third headline, Bernie wins - Bernie Sanders beating Hillary Clinton would be an upset. That's unexpected, and that would be big news. CORNISH: Let's talk about the factors that could make those headlines come true or not. What are you actually watching for this evening? LIASSON: The biggest factor is turnout. Most analysts believe that a big turnout benefits the two outsiders - Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders. Lower turnout would help Ted Cruz and Hillary Clinton. And both Sanders and Trump have been trying to expand the universe of Iowa voters by bringing in people who've never caucused before. Trump wants to big in those non-college-educated, white, working-class voters who line up for hours to get into his events, and Sanders has been reaching out to young voters. Both these candidates lead by double digits with people who say they're participating in their first caucus, but the big question is how many of those first-time Trump and Sanders voters or potential first-time voters will actually turn out. CORNISH: OK. Those are the sort of big names for you. Can we dig in a little more on the Democratic side in terms of what matters most? LIASSON: Well, the Democratic side really is a battle between organization and enthusiasm. Both candidates have enthusiastic supporters. Both have good organization. But Hillary Clinton is relying more on a ground game. Bernie Sanders is relying more on the raw passion that he's been able to be excite among his supporters. And Hillary Clinton, who was stung by her third-place finish eight years ago in Iowa, has built a very formidable operation. She started organizing very, very early. Bernie Sanders came later, but he has concentrated on an organization in college towns where his supporters are and recently trying to move into rural areas because geography also really matters for Democrats. Unlike the Republican caucuses, Democrats report delegate totals not vote totals, and delegates are awarded through a formula based on how candidates do in precincts all over the state. And that means Sanders could be at a disadvantage if his support is heavily concentrated in college towns and urban areas. CORNISH: All right. It gets complicated there. LIASSON: Yeah. CORNISH: Can you talk more about the Republican side? What would make the most difference in that contest? LIASSON: Well, I think the big question is, can Ted Cruz win Iowa? I think the stakes are highest for him. This is a state tailor-made for Ted Cruz - lots of conservative evangelical voters. If he comes in second to Trump in Iowa, he's going to have a much harder path to the nomination. That's why Cruz has been telling his supporters that if Trump wins Iowa, he will be unstoppable because Trump doesn't need to win Iowa to get the nomination because he's ahead in all the other early states. I also am watching to see how Marco Rubio does. Does he come in a strong third, or does he really surpass expectations and surge past Cruz to place second? In which case he would become, I think, the clear establishment alternative to Trump or Cruz. CORNISH: And that's NPR's national political correspondent Mara Liasson. Mara, thanks.

One big question is whether Sanders and outsider Donald Trump, who have been attracting large crowds, can get their supporters to caucus.\n                \n                    \n                    Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Guests sign in for a Bernie Sanders campaign event in Marshalltown, Iowa, in January. One big question is whether Sanders and outsider Donald Trump, who have been attracting large crowds, can get their supporters to caucus. Finally, after more than 10 months of campaigning from more than a dozen presidential candidates, voters get to weigh in. Iowa Republicans and Democrats will caucus Monday night, and the results could at long last provide some clarity to the Republican and Democratic nominating contests \u2014 or not. Here are five things we're watching: How many voters show up Monday night makes a difference. Voting in a caucus is harder than voting in a primary. Iowans have to show up at their caucus site at a specific time and in some cases stay there for a couple of hours. Most analysts and campaign operatives agree that a big turnout benefits the two outsiders \u2014 Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders. Lower turnout helps Ted Cruz and Hillary Clinton. Both Trump and Sanders have been trying to expand the universe of Iowa voters by bringing in people who have never caucused before. Trump has a great following with noncollege-educated, white, working-class voters, while Sanders has been reaching out to young voters. Both men lead by double digits with people who tell pollsters they will be participating in their first caucus. But the big question is how many of those first-time Trump and Sanders voters will actually turn out? The previous turnout record for Republicans was 122,000 votes, set in 2012. If Trump gets a lot of the people who stand in line for hours to get into his rallies to the caucus sites Monday night, that number should be much higher \u2014 maybe as high as 150,000. In 2008, Barack Obama shattered all Iowa records and helped Iowa Democratic turnout reach 240,000. No one is expecting that big a turnout tonight, but Bernie Sanders needs the number to be above the 124,000 that turned out in 2004. The weather will also be a factor. There's a winter storm predicted to start Tuesday, but it could hit parts of Iowa on Monday night, and that could depress turnout. The state is tailor-made for Ted Cruz, with lots of conservative evangelical voters. He needs to win it \u2014 if he comes in second to Trump, he will have a much harder path to the nomination. And that's why Cruz has been telling his supporters that if Trump wins Iowa, he will be unstoppable. That's because although Trump doesn't need to win Iowa to get the nomination, if he does win, he will have tremendous momentum. He's already ahead 2-to-1 in New Hampshire polls and has leads in all the other early states. Marco Rubio has a 3-2-1 strategy: Come in third in Iowa, second in New Hampshire and then win \u2014 somewhere. But where? South Carolina? Nevada? Rubio needs a strong third in Iowa to convince his donors that he has a clear path to the nomination. The Republican establishment would like to coalesce around Rubio as an alternative to Trump or Cruz, but they've been holding back. A stronger-than-expected finish in Iowa would help him consolidate the  mainstream wing of the GOP. If Rubio manages to surge past Cruz and place second in Iowa, he'll be set up to place second to Trump in New Hampshire and become the clear establishment alternative. This is the big question on the Democratic side. Hillary Clinton, stung by her third-place finish eight years ago, built a formidable get-out-the-vote operation. But organization doesn't work without enthusiasm. And the enthusiasm gap favors Sanders, who has excited Democrats with his calls to break up the big banks and make college and health care free. But Sanders started organizing late in Iowa, and he, like Cruz, really needs to win Iowa. If he beats Clinton in Iowa, it would be an upset, and he'd head into New Hampshire with even more momentum. He already has a big lead there, as neighboring-state candidates usually do (Sanders is from Vermont). A win in both Iowa and New Hampshire for Sanders could change the dynamic in the South, where Clinton has built a firewall based on her support among African-American Democrats. This matters for Democrats. Unlike the Republican caucuses, Democrats report delegate totals, not vote totals. And delegates are awarded through a formula based on how candidates do in precincts all over the state. Sanders could be at a disadvantage here because his support has been heavily concentrated in college towns and urban areas, although the Sanders campaign has been trying to expand its reach to rural areas. Clinton's team is filled with Obama field-operation veterans who have built an organization for Clinton that reaches all of Iowa's 99 counties and 1,683 precincts. Want more?

            "article_content": "Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump (foreground), greets supporters after a rally last week in Iowa.\n                \n                    \n                    Jae C. Hong/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump (foreground), greets supporters after a rally last week in Iowa. Plenty of politicos and pundits have rationalized Donald Trump's political ascent as the result of his enormous popularity among white working-class voters. No doubt Trump is well-liked by many college-educated Republicans, but his real strength is among those without a bachelor's degree. In that demographic, most polls show the business-mogul-turned-GOP-presidential-candidate is trouncing his Republican rivals. In fact, the main reason Trump is leading national polls is because he dominates the white non-college world. That got us thinking: How powerful are white voters who don't have college degrees? And what role do they play in the GOP of today versus the GOP of yesterday? Reliably Republican \u2014 And Shrinking In 1980, whites without a college degree made up almost two-thirds of the electorate (65 percent). Back then, both Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Carter relied heavily on white working-class voters \u2014 60 percent of Carter voters were whites without a college degree, compared to 70 percent of Reagan voters. Keep in mind, Reagan won that election in a landslide. Jump ahead a few decades, dig through exit polls, and you'll find a very different political landscape. \"The electorate as a whole has gotten both more highly educated and also more diverse,\" explained Jocelyn Kiley, a researcher who focuses on U.S. politics at the Pew Research Center, who helped us dig through the data. In the 2012 generational election, half of Mitt Romney's supporters were whites without a college degree, compared to about a quarter of Obama voters. Yet Romney still lost the presidency \u2014 and by an Electoral College landslide. That's because white blue-collar voters are a shrinking share of the voting pool. As their population shrinks, they've also become more faithfully Republican. \"My contention is that what Reagan did was he brought a new group of people into the Republican Party, and that has grown and has become more significant,\" explained Democratic pollster Peter Hart. \"It is less establishment; it is more what I call downscale, blue-collar non-establishment.\" Another way to think about this is that while white working-class voters are now only about a third of the overall electorate, they're about half of the Republican electorate. \"They remain an important part of the GOP base,\" Kiley said. \"And it's a large part of why there's been so much attention to them in the Republican primary.\" Working-class voters are still a bedrock of the GOP in two states candidates really want to win \u2014 Iowa and New Hampshire. They made up nearly half of Republicans in the 2012 Iowa caucus and 45 percent of voters in the 2012 New Hampshire primary. And so while mathematically a candidate can no longer win a general election with their support alone, it's also nearly impossible for a Republican presidential candidate to win a GOP primary without them. The road to the GOP nomination travels through many white working-class neighborhoods. And that's one reason it's been difficult for the party to expand its base. New Factor: The Hyper-Educated And The Educational Divide White voters without college degrees are an important component of the GOP coalition, an over-reliance on them can be a crutch when hyper-educated and nonwhite populations are growing \u2014 and becoming increasingly Democratic. In general, whites tend to vote Republican more than people of color across educational backgrounds. In 2012, just over half of Obama voters were white, while 89 percent of Romney voters were. So even among white college graduates, Republicans do better than Democrats, with one caveat \u2014 people with postgraduate degrees. \"Postgraduates today are overwhelmingly Democratic or lean Democratic in their partisan identification, to much a greater extent than they were 20 years ago,\" said Kiley, who traced data back to 1988. In recent years, the correlation between party ID and educational attainment has grown. Essentially, the education gap has morphed into an education gulf. White women with advanced degrees are now one of the most faithful Democratic subgroups. According to data from the Pew Research Center, 62 percent are Democratic or lean Democratic. In the 2012 election, there was a 30-point margin between how whites with a postgraduate degree voted compared to how whites with no college degrees voted. But a GOP voter today is more likely to be white and working-class than a Democratic voter \u2014 and they still hold more political power than hyper-educated white voters. So the candidate who can connect with them has an edge in the GOP primary \u2014 even though it might hurt in a general election.",

            "article_content": "The Democratic presidential candidates are in Iowa Monday, three weeks ahead of the caucuses. With polls showing a tight race, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders are highlighting differences.  KELLY MCEVERS, HOST: With the Iowa caucuses just three weeks away, polls show Bernie Sanders is gaining on Hillary Clinton in the Democratic race, and that has force the two leading contenders to finally get tough on each other. NPR's Tamara Keith joins us now from Iowa. And Tam, it's that time of the race when it's actually OK to talk about the horse race. Catch us up here. TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Indeed. And the latest polls show that it's close in both Iowa and New Hampshire. Now, if you were to just look at the Democratic electorate and know that there's this strong liberal wing of the party, you'd say that isn't a surprise. And both campaigns, for some time now, have been saying that it would be close in the early states of Iowa and New Hampshire. It's just, no one believed them for opposite reasons. And now people are starting to believe them. MCEVERS: Right. So the candidates are mixing it up on a few issues. Let's start with guns first. KEITH: Yeah. President Obama put gun control back on the agenda in the Democratic race last week with his executive actions. Then Friday, he published an op-ed in The New York Times, saying he wouldn't support candidates, even Democrats, that didn't support common-sense gun legislation. That's his phrase. MCEVERS: Yeah. KEITH: And this created an opening for Clinton to point back at Bernie Sanders and a vote that he took in 2005 to protect gun makers and dealers from lawsuits. And now Clinton is really hitting Bernie Sanders hard on that. She had brought it up a few months ago but never, you know, hit him by name. Now she's using his name. I should also note that in the last two days, Clinton has received endorsements from former Congresswoman Gabby Giffords as well as the mother of Trayvon Martin, and both of them cite her position on guns. MCEVERS: How is Bernie Sanders responding to all this? KEITH: He has said for a while that he would be open to revisiting the issue of gun maker and seller immunity, but he hasn't committed to repealing the immunity. And more broadly, there's a sense that Sanders - he comes from Vermont, which is a state with a strong gun culture, and he's staked out a more moderate position on guns than on other issues. And this may, in part, be related to his belief that he could win white working-class voters that have voted Republican in recent elections. And so he is not being moved on this by Clinton's push. And he said at a rally yesterday in Iowa that Clinton is just focusing on this gun issue now because she's not doing as well in the polls as she had been expected to be doing. MCEVERS: There not just talking about guns - right? - these two Democratic candidates. They're also talking about family leave, right? KEITH: Yes. Both support 12 weeks of paid family leave. And now they're fighting over how to pay for it. Sanders wants a small payroll tax. He's calling on Clinton to support legislation that would do that. She wants to do it through a tax on the wealthy. And we can expect more conversation from both of them about taxes. They are not going to agree entirely on taxes, and they'll be rolling out their plans in the coming days and weeks. MCEVERS: That's NPR's Tamara Keith. Thanks so much, Tam. KEITH: You're welcome. Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "\"The whole idea from the start was to build a site that could kind of infiltrate the echo chambers of the alt-right.\"\n                \n                    \n                    Fanatic Studio/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption \"The whole idea from the start was to build a site that could kind of infiltrate the echo chambers of the alt-right.\" A lot of fake and misleading news stories were shared across social media during the election. One that got a lot of traffic had this headline: \"FBI Agent Suspected In Hillary Email Leaks Found Dead In Apparent Murder-Suicide.\" The story is completely false, but it was shared on Facebook over half a million times. We wondered who was behind that story and why it was written. It appeared on a site that had the look and feel of a local newspaper. Denverguardian.com even had the local weather. But it had only one news story \u2014 the fake one. We tried to look up who owned it and hit a wall. The site was registered anonymously. So we brought in some professional help. By day, John Jansen is head of engineering at Master-McNeil Inc., a tech company in Berkeley, Calif. In the interest of real news he helped us track down the owner of Denverguardian.com. Jansen started by looking at the site's history. \"Commonly that's called scraping or crawling websites,\" he says. Jansen is kind of like an archaeologist. He says that nothing you do on the Web disappears \u2014 it just gets buried \u2014 like a fossil. But if you do some digging you'll find those fossils and learn a lot of history. The \"Denver Guardian\" was built and designed using a pretty common platform \u2014 WordPress. It's used by bloggers and people who want to create their own websites. Jansen found that the first entry ever for the site was done by someone with the handle LetTexasSecede. The whole idea from the start was to build a site that could kind of infiltrate the echo chambers of the alt-right, publish blatantly or fictional stories and then be able to publicly denounce those stories and point out the fact that they were fiction. Jestin Coler, publisher of fake news sites \"That was sort of the thread that started to unravel everything,\" Jansen says. \"I was able to track that through to a bunch of other sites which are where that handle is also present.\" The sites include NationalReport.net, USAToday.com.co, WashingtonPost.com.co. All the addresses linked to a single rented server inside Amazon Web Services. That meant they were all very likely owned by the same company. Jansen found an email address on one of those sites and was able to link that address to a name: Jestin Coler. Online, Coler was listed as the founder and CEO of a company called Disinfomedia. Coler's LinkedIn profile said he once sold magazine subscriptions, worked as a database administrator and as a freelance writer for among others, International Yachtsman magazine. And, using his name, we found a home address. On a warm, sunny afternoon I set out with a producer for a suburb of Los Angeles. Coler lived in a middle-class neighborhood of pastel-colored one-story beach bungalows. His home had an unwatered lawn \u2014 probably the result of California's ongoing drought. There was a black minivan in the driveway and a large prominent American flag. We rang the front doorbell and a man answered, his face obscured by a heavy mesh steel screen. I asked for Jestin Coler. The man indicated that's who he was. But when I asked about Disinfomedia, he said, \"I don't know what to tell you guys. Have a good day.\" We left Coler our contact information thinking he wasn't likely to talk. But a couple of hours later he had a change of heart. He sent us an email and we set up an interview. Coler is a soft-spoken 40-year-old with a wife and two kids. He says he got into fake news around 2013 to highlight the extremism of the white nationalist alt-right. \"The whole idea from the start was to build a site that could kind of infiltrate the echo chambers of the alt-right, publish blatantly or fictional stories and then be able to publicly denounce those stories and point out the fact that they were fiction,\" Coler says. He was amazed at how quickly fake news could spread and how easily people believe it. He wrote one fake story for NationalReport.net about how customers in Colorado marijuana shops were using food stamps to buy pot. \"What that turned into was a state representative in the House in Colorado proposing actual legislation to prevent people from using their food stamps to buy marijuana based on something that had just never happened,\" Coler says. During the run-up to the presidential election, fake news really took off. \"It was just anybody with a blog can get on there and find a big, huge Facebook group of kind of rabid Trump supporters just waiting to eat up this red meat that they're about to get served,\" Coler says. \"It caused an explosion in the number of sites. I mean, my gosh, the number of just fake accounts on Facebook exploded during the Trump election.\" Coler says his writers have tried to write fake news for liberals \u2014 but they just never take the bait. Coler's company, Disinfomedia, owns many faux news sites \u2014 he won't say how many. But he says his is one of the biggest fake-news businesses out there, which makes him a sort of godfather of the industry. At any given time, Coler says, he has between 20 and 25 writers. And it was one of them who wrote the story in the \"Denver Guardian\" that an FBI agent who leaked Clinton emails was killed. Coler says that over 10 days the site got 1.6 million views. He says stories like this work because they fit into existing right-wing conspiracy theories. \"The people wanted to hear this,\" he says. \"So all it took was to write that story. Everything about it was fictional: the town, the people, the sheriff, the FBI guy. And then ... our social media guys kind of go out and do a little dropping it throughout Trump groups and Trump forums and boy it spread like wildfire.\" And as the stories spread, Coler makes money from the ads on his websites. He wouldn't give exact figures, but he says stories about other fake-news proprietors making between $10,000 and $30,000 a month apply to him. Coler fits into a pattern of other faux news sites that make good money, especially by targeting Trump supporters. However, Coler insists this is not about money. It's about showing how easily fake news spreads. And fake news spread wide and far before the election. When I pointed out to Coler that the money gave him a lot of incentive to keep doing it regardless of the impact, he admitted that was \"correct.\" Coler says he has tried to shine a light on the problem of fake news. He has spoken to the media about it. But those organizations didn't know who he actually was. He gave them a fake name: Allen Montgomery. Coler, a registered Democrat, says he has no regrets about his fake news empire. He doesn't think fake news swayed the election. \"There are many factors as to why Trump won that don't involve fake news,\" he says. \"As much as I like Hillary, she was a poor candidate. She brought in a lot of baggage.\" Coler doesn't think fake news is going away. One of his sites \u2014 NationalReport.net \u2014 was flagged as fake news under a new Google policy, and Google stopped running ads on it. But Coler had other options. \"There are literally hundreds of ad networks,\" he says. \"Early last week, my inbox was just filled every day with people because they knew that Google was cracking down \u2014 hundreds of people wanting to work with my sites.\" Coler says he has been talking it over with his wife and may be getting out of the fake-news racket. But, he says, dozens, maybe hundreds of entrepreneurs will be ready to take his place. And he thinks it will only get harder to tell their websites from real news sites. They know now that fake news sells and they will only be in it for the money. Below are highlights of NPR's interview with Coler. Tell me a little about why you started Disinfomedia? Late 2012, early 2013 I was spending a lot of time researching what is now being referred to as the alt-right. I identified a problem with the news that they were spreading and created Disinfomedia as a response to that. The whole idea from the start was to build a site that could infiltrate the echo chambers of the alt-right, publish blatantly false or fictional stories and then be able to publicly denounce those stories and point out the fact that they were fiction. What got you engaged in this? My educational background is in political science. I've always enjoyed the ideas of propaganda and misinformation. Then I coupled that with an interest in what makes things go viral. So that led me to finding those groups and ultimately to finding contributors. But it was just something I had an interest in that I wanted to pursue. When did you notice that fake news does best with Trump supporters? Well, this isn't just a Trump-supporter problem. This is a right-wing issue. Sarah Palin's famous blasting of the lamestream media is kind of record and testament to the rise of these kinds of people. The post-fact era is what I would refer to it as. This isn't something that started with Trump. This is something that's been in the works for a while. His whole campaign was this thing of discrediting mainstream media sources, which is one of those dog whistles to his supporters. When we were coming up with headlines it's always kind of about the red meat. Trump really got into the red meat. He knew who his base was. He knew how to feed them a constant diet of this red meat. We've tried to do similar things to liberals. It just has never worked, it never takes off. You'll get debunked within the first two comments and then the whole thing just kind of fizzles out. How many domains do you own and run? Well, I would say there's somewhere around 25 domains that I am currently managing. National Report has been my bread and butter, where I've spent most of my time. I have people who work with me and for me in developing and maintaining the other sites and social media kind of stuff. [Coler later said not all his sites are fake news.] So I, for the most part, focus on National Report, and a lot of the other stuff is run by other folks on the team. So, you're the publisher of an empire. Well I wouldn't go so far as to call it an empire but, yes, it's several sites [chuckle]. How many people do you have writing for you? It comes and goes, and as for actual employed writers, again these guys sort of make their own money through ad code. So I don't say, 'Hey, you have to write 10 stories this week' and this and that. Really, we have a more free-form idea where people, when their creativity strikes them then they can write something. And if they're in a slump then they just go dormant for a while. With that said, at any given time there's probably 20, 25 contributors all over the country. ... Talk about the \"Denver Guardian.\" Well, it's kind of a side project. We have some people working on next steps in the fake-news industry, and that came from that whole discussion. We had purchased several domain names that sounded legitimate. ... More local news sort of stories. The idea was to make the sites look as legit as possible so the home page is going to be local news and local forecast, local sports, some obituaries and things of that nature, and then the actual fake news stories were going to be buried off the home page. We've tried lots of things in the past. The dot-com-dot-co domains were something I toyed in for a while. Those I quickly got away from because you don't get away long with borrowing someone's copyright or trademark. That was something that worked very well from a fake-news perspective. People were fooled into the domain name, but that wasn't so much what we were after. So again, the next step was to go after more city-type sites. And the \"Denver Guardian\" was one of those sites. You're talking about the future of this (fake-news business) which looks more insidious because it's more real? That's the way that it's going to be. Not just from where I am. I mean, this is probably going to be my last run in the fake-news biz, but I can promise you that it's not going to go away. It's even going to grow bigger and it's going to be harder to identify as it kind of evolves through these steps. ... Do you know who wrote the actual FBI Clinton story? I do know who wrote the story, but only through an anonymous pen name. Privacy is something that we take very seriously in our writers group. The actual reasonings behind that story ... it's one of hundreds that have been written about mysterious deaths of Clinton associates or political foes. This one kind of took off more than others, I believe, just because of the nature of the story. The people wanted to hear this. So all it took was to write that story. Everything about it was fictional. The town, the people, the sheriff, the FBI guy. Then, we had our social media guys kind of go out and do a little dropping it throughout Trump groups and Trump forums and boy it spread like wildfire. Why hide your identity? This isn't the safest business to be in, to be honest. Just the number of death threats I've received. I have a beautiful family, a beautiful life. Some of these people that we ... bait is probably the right word \u2014 are often \u2014 let's call them the deplorables, right? They're not the safest crowd. Some of them I would consider domestic terrorists. So they're just not people that I want to be knocking on my door. It seems like National Report is getting spoofier. If you went to National Report today, it's specifically satire. \"Chris Christie nominated to Supreme Food Court.\" \"Sarah Palin Banning Muslims from Entering Bristol Palin.\" They're a little bit more offensive than some people care for their satire. I mean fat-shaming and slut-shaming isn't something that is normally met with applause. But again, it's a lot more fun in nature. Do you make serious money? It depends on what you would call serious money. I think I do pretty well. Can you say how well? I would rather not. There have been some people who have been reported on recently. The folks in Long Beach that were doing just all right stuff. They were reporting $10,000 to $30,000 a month; I think that's probably a relative ballpark. So you're doing as well as those? Yes. You're making money through the ads? Yes. Who do you work with? We have several advertisers. Google was one, although they shut down my account last week. We've replaced them with other advertisers. Can I ask who? There are literally hundreds of ad networks. Literally hundreds. Last week my inbox was just filled everyday with people, because they knew that Google was cracking down \u2014 hundreds of people wanting to work with my sites. I kind of applaud Google for their steps, although I think what they're doing is kind of random. They don't really have a process in place for identifying these things. I happen to know a very successful site that, as of today, of this morning is still serving Google ads. So it seems to be a kind of arbitrary step that they're taking either based on, I don't know if it was my reputation within the industry or specifically the \"Denver Guardian\" site that angered them, or I don't know what it is, but back to your question, there's hundreds of people that will work with me. What can be done about fake news? Some of this has to fall on the readers themselves. The consumers of content have to be better at identifying this stuff. We have a whole nation of media-illiterate people. Really, there needs to be something done. Do you consider yourself an entrepreneur? Sure. Are you one of the biggest in the fake-news biz? If you look at someone who has specifically sometimes peddled in fictional news then I think that I would probably be considered one of the larger sites. As a liberal, do you have any regrets? I don't. Again, this is something that I've been crying about for a while. But outside of that, there are many factors as to why Trump won that don't involve fake news, right? As much as I like Hillary, she was a poor candidate. She brought in a lot of baggage. You don't feel responsible. I do not. Do you think you would have kept doing it if it wasn't so lucrative? Really, the financial part of it isn't the only motivator for me. I do enjoy making a mess of the people that share the content that comes out of our site. It's not just the financial incentive for me. I still enjoy the game I guess. Would you do this all over again? Well, I guess it came to a head here and we're talking about it. It'll be interesting to see what happens moving forward. If I had to, if I knew specifically the \"Denver Guardian\" situation, that would have been handled differently. But everything else, as far as the work I've done with National Report, I'm very proud of, and I'm going to continue doing it.",

            "article_content": "Distrust of the government drove many Donald Trump supporters to vote in New Hampshire. They hope changes at the White House will better support middle class Americans.  KELLY MCEVERS, HOST: Nearly a week after the presidential election, the Associated Press has now declared Hillary Clinton the winner in New Hampshire. Clinton beat Donald Trump by less than 3,000 votes. This news doesn't change the outcome of the race. Donald Trump is still president-elect. Exit polls in New Hampshire show that one of the main reasons many people voted for Trump was that they didn't trust the government. NPR's Hansi Lo Wang met some Trump voters in the Granite State. HANSI LO WANG, BYLINE: Jude Augusta will tell you he has trust issues with the government outside of his town of Hampton Falls, N.H. JUDE AUGUSTA: The town clerk is usually a pretty good egg around here, but the feds - not at all, zero. WANG: And that's why he started a Facebook group about a year ago. It's called the New Hampshire Seacoast Rebel-utionaries. Their page describes them as, quote, \"defenders of our Constitution and culture.\" AUGUSTA: It says, (reading) libertarians, conservatives and still-conflicted Democrats. The reason I wrote still-conflicted is because these same people that voted - my mom, my dad - for JFK voted for Donald J. Trump. WANG: And so did Augusta. The day after the election, he wore a navy blue Trump flag like a cape on his morning run. Though he admits his political hero is not perfect. AUGUSTA: He is a flawed individual. None of us would disagree with that. I'd say none of us would probably disagree with he's got a copious amount of flaws. However, his heart's in the right place. We don't think Obama's heart is in the right place. WANG: Augusta says one of his main fears is a porous U.S.-Mexico border that terrorists can cross. And he doesn't think Obama's policies have been protecting the country. There's a similar kind of distrust amongst other Trump supporters in New Hampshire, according to Andrew Smith. He's the director of the University of New Hampshire Survey Center. ANDREW SMITH: There is anger for the inability of the government to deliver on a lot of the promises that were made during the last couple election cycles. WANG: Smith says the economic recovery has not touched many Trump voters, especially those without college degrees. Still, that's not the whole story. New Hampshire has the country's lowest unemployment rate tied with South Dakota. But its population, which is about 94 percent white, is aging, and the fishing industry along the Seacoast has seen better days. Smith says Trump supporters have been funneling their frustration through campaign phrases like drain the swamp as anger towards the Democrats in power and Hillary Clinton. And now Smith says expectations for the Trump administration are high. SMITH: That's the problem that voters are going to have because a phrase that's as nonspecific as drain the swamp can be interpreted in many, many different ways. (LAUGHTER) WANG: Here at The Clay Dragon Tattoo Studio in Seabrook, N.H., draining the swamp begins with replacing Obama with Trump. How long does a Donald Trump tattoo usually take? BOB HOLMES: Usually about 45 minutes. WANG: Bob Holmes owns this studio. So far his shops have inked 76 tattoos of Trump's face or campaign slogans on his supporters for free. Holmes is 48 and says he gave his first-ever vote to Trump. He hopes Trump will get rid of Obama's health insurance mandate, cut taxes so he can open up another tattoo shop more easily and start running the federal government like a business. HOLMES: Yes, when you're a businessman, your word is everything. You do everything you possibly can for your employees, for your business. I know that because I'm the same exact way. So I like the fact that he's more like me. WANG: And not a career politician like Obama or Clinton whom Holmes says he cannot trust. HOLMES: I just hate the government thinking that we are just dumb sheep and that we're just going to allow them to keep doing this [expletive]. And our country stood up, voted Donald Trump into office because we're not that stupid. JAKE FALLAS: I voted for Obama in '08 because I was stupid. WANG: Jake Fallas is 29 and a member of New Hampshire Seacoast Rebel-utionaries. FALLAS: But I thought, why not have a black president? Why not have someone different because Bush disappointed me. WANG: Now Obama's disappointed him with an economy that he's not sure how to start a family in. He says that's why he voted for Trump. But he doesn't expect him to carry out all of his promises. Neither does Laura Soussan. She says she'll be happy if Trump can accomplish just half of his 100-day plan. All Americans, she says, should give him a chance. LAURA SOUSSAN: Now the shoe's on the other foot. We didn't trust the Obama administration. They don't trust the Trump administration. For every action, there's an equal-opposite reaction. It's a balance. But if anybody can straighten this mess out, it's him. WANG: And he'll have the next four years to make his case. Hansi Lo Wang, NPR News. Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.

The city is one of three in California, and four in the U.S., that passed taxes on sodas and other sugary drinks in Tuesday's election.\n                \n                    \n                    Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Bottles of Fanta are displayed in a food truck's cooler in San Francisco, Calif. The city is one of three in California, and four in the U.S., that passed taxes on sodas and other sugary drinks in Tuesday's election. Voters in three cities in California passed ballot measures to place a one cent-per-ounce tax on sodas and other sugar-sweetened beverages, a move aimed at tackling obesity. In San Francisco, 62 percent of voters cast their ballots in favor of the tax on sugary drinks. Similar measures passed in Oakland and Albany, Calif. In addition, the city of Boulder, Colo., passed a 2 cents-per-ounce tax. \"The growing worldwide movement to tax sugary beverages can no longer be stopped,\" wrote Harold Goldstein, executive director of Public Health Advocates in a release today. Goldstein pointed to the World Health Organization's recent report calling on nations around the globe to tax sugary drinks. As we've reported, after Berkeley, Calif., passed a tax on sugary drinks, one study found that consumption of sugary drinks dropped by about 20 percent. And, after Mexico imposed a tax on sugar-sweetened beverages in 2014, researchers documented a decline in sales. The CEO of the American Heart Association touted the passage of the soda tax measures as a big win for public health. \"We applaud voters for rejecting the big spending and false arguments of outsiders and standing up for what they knew was right for their community,\" wrote Nancy Brown, CEO of the American Heart Association, in a statement today. \"From sports drinks to sodas to fruit-flavored drinks, today's children are drinking their age in these sugary drinks each week. Reducing consumption will improve rates of diabetes, heart disease and tooth decay,\" Brown concluded. The American Beverage Association, which represents all the big soda brands, led the effort to oppose the soda tax measures. The group spent upwards of $9.5 million on a ad campaign, dubbed \"Don't Tax Our Groceries.\" \"Voters in the Bay Area have made a decision, and we respect their decision,\" Susan Neely, CEO of the American Beverage Association, told us by phone. But she says taxes are not the best way to pursue the public health objective of tackling obesity. \"Consumers don't want these taxes ... and we think there's a more effective way to go about it,\" Neely says. \"We are deeply and publicly committed to reducing calories and sugar from our beverages,\" Neely explains, pointing to a pledge to a 20 percent reduction by 2025. Neely explains that the industry has partnered with the Alliance for a Healthier Generation to work in communities with high rates of obesity to try to change the behaviors of people who may be getting too many calories from sugar-sweetened beverages. Currently, the group has efforts underway in Alabama and Mississippi, as well as communities in the Bronx and Brooklyn, N.Y. A billboard at a New York subway stop in Brooklyn nudges consumers to think about the calories they consume. It's part of a soda industry-funded campaign to target obesity.\n                \n                    \n                    Allison Aubrey/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption A billboard at a New York subway stop in Brooklyn nudges consumers to think about the calories they consume. It's part of a soda industry-funded campaign to target obesity. \"We're doing a double-down to try to change behavior to reduce [consumption of] calories and sugar from our beverages,\" Neely told us. Some of the efforts include offering taste tests and coupons for lower-calorie and zero calories options. Other strategies include a billboard campaign, Balance What You Eat, Drink & Do,\" aimed at nudging people to think about the calories they're consuming. The industry is also working with retailers to place lower-calorie options at eye-level, so that consumers may be more likely to notice them. Neely says she doesn't agree with public health advocates who argue that there's growing momentum for soda taxes. \"I just don't see middle-class tax increases spreading across the country. I don't think there's support by people, and I don't see this as a movement.\"",

At the end of October, Donald Trump spoke in Gettysburg, Pa., and released a plan for his first 100 days in office. The plan (below) outlines three main areas of focus: cleaning up Washington, including by imposing term limits on Congress; protecting American workers; and restoring rule of law. He also laid out his plan for working with Congress to introduce 10 pieces of legislation that would repeal Obamacare, fund the construction of a wall at the Southern border (with a provision that Mexico would reimburse the U.S.), encourage infrastructure investment, rebuild military bases, promote school choice and more. On Wednesday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell mostly made nice with Trump but also shot down or expressed little enthusiasm in some of his plans. On Trump's proposal to impose term limits on Congress, McConnell said, \"It will not be on the agenda in the Senate.\" McConnell has been a long-standing opponent of term limits, as NPR's Susan Davis reports. \"I would say we have term limits now \u2014 they're called elections.\" McConnell also threw some cold water on Trump's infrastructure plans, calling it not a top priority. McConnell did say repealing Obamacare is a \"pretty high item on our agenda\" along with comprehensive tax reform and achieving border security \"in whatever way is the most effective.\" But he also declined to discuss the Senate's immigration agenda further. \"We look forward to working with him,\" McConnell said. \"I think most of the things that he's likely to advocate we're going to be enthusiastically for.\" Below is the 100-day plan Trump's campaign released in October, called \"Donald Trump's Contract With The American Voter.\" What follows is my 100-day action plan to Make America Great Again. It is a contract between myself and the American voter \u2014 and begins with restoring honesty, accountability and change to Washington Therefore, on the first day of my term of office, my administration will immediately pursue the following six measures to clean up the corruption and special interest collusion in Washington, DC: * FIRST, propose a Constitutional Amendment to impose term limits on all members of Congress; * SECOND, a hiring freeze on all federal employees to reduce federal workforce through attrition (exempting military, public safety, and public health); * THIRD, a requirement that for every new federal regulation, two existing regulations must be eliminated; * FOURTH, a 5 year-ban on White House and Congressional officials becoming lobbyists after they leave government service; * FIFTH, a lifetime ban on White House officials lobbying on behalf of a foreign government; * SIXTH, a complete ban on foreign lobbyists raising money for American elections. On the same day, I will begin taking the following 7 actions to protect American workers: * FIRST, I will announce my intention to renegotiate NAFTA or withdraw from the deal under Article 2205 * SECOND, I will announce our withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership * THIRD, I will direct my Secretary of the Treasury to label China a currency manipulator * FOURTH, I will direct the Secretary of Commerce and U.S. Trade Representative to identify all foreign trading abuses that unfairly impact American workers and direct them to use every tool under American and international law to end those abuses immediately * FIFTH, I will lift the restrictions on the production of $50 trillion dollars' worth of job-producing American energy reserves, including shale, oil, natural gas and clean coal. * SIXTH, lift the Obama-Clinton roadblocks and allow vital energy infrastructure projects, like the Keystone Pipeline, to move forward * SEVENTH, cancel billions in payments to U.N. climate change programs and use the money to fix America's water and environmental infrastructure Additionally, on the first day, I will take the following five actions to restore security and the constitutional rule of law: * FIRST, cancel every unconstitutional executive action, memorandum and order issued by President Obama * SECOND, begin the process of selecting a replacement for Justice Scalia from one of the 20 judges on my list, who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States * THIRD, cancel all federal funding to Sanctuary Cities * FOURTH, begin removing the more than 2 million criminal illegal immigrants from the country and cancel visas to foreign countries that won't take them back * FIFTH, suspend immigration from terror-prone regions where vetting cannot safely occur. All vetting of people coming into our country will be considered extreme vetting. Next, I will work with Congress to introduce the following broader legislative measures and fight for their passage within the first 100 days of my Administration: On November 8th, Americans will be voting for this 100-day plan to restore prosperity to our economy, security to our communities, and honesty to our government. This is my pledge to you. And if we follow these steps, we will once more have a government of, by and for the people. To comment, go to this story on NPR's Facebook page.",

            "article_content": "Election Day is nearly upon us. So where does the electoral map stand? It's a close race, with Hillary Clinton retaining a broad and consistent but shallow advantage, according to the final NPR Battleground Map. Compared with a couple of weeks ago, when Clinton hit her peak lead, the race has tightened. So our map reflects that \u2014 almost all of the moves benefit Trump, though because of one potentially determinative move, Clinton still surpasses the 270 electoral votes needed to be president with just the states in which she's favored. It's worth noting that for all the vacillations in this race, Clinton has been above 270 with just Lean Democratic states in the NPR Battleground Map in every NPR map since May, except one. And even in that, she was just 2 electoral votes shy of 270. The big moves in the final map: Former Toss-ups Ohio, Iowa, Georgia and Arizona are now in Trump's corner; New Hampshire was moved out of Clinton's column and back into Toss-up. But Nevada has also shifted from Toss-up to Lean Democratic. Clinton has driven up the score with early voting there. That could prove crucial, because even if Trump picks up the remaining Toss-ups \u2014 New Hampshire, Florida, North Carolina and the two electoral votes between Maine and Nebraska \u2014 Trump would still come up short. Let's repeat that: Even with Florida and Ohio, Iowa, North Carolina and New Hampshire, Trump would still need to pick up one more Democratic-leaning state. It's why he's barnstorming the country with a dizzying final push, hoping to pick off one state \u2014 Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Virginia or even Minnesota, a state that's been closer in recent presidential elections than many might think. The Trump campaign all but acknowledges it's behind in the Lean Democratic states in NPR's map, but notes that many of the races are tight. If the Blue Wall holds, Clinton wins There's an important reason Clinton's campaign is focusing on turning out black voters in Philadelphia and Detroit in the final days. If the Blue Wall of states leaning Clinton's direction holds, she wins. Clinton continues to lead in Pennsylvania, though, by narrower margins than a few weeks ago. And polls have tightened in Michigan. President Obama is heading to Michigan and has acknowledged a lack of enthusiasm among black voters, whom he is strongly urging to turn out to protect his legacy. The Clinton campaign continues to be confident about both places, but acknowledges potentially close races, especially in Michigan. Campaigning in both states in the final days of the race is also a strategic move by the campaign, because there's no early, in-person voting in either state. All voters have to be mobilized on Election Day. Clinton isn't going back to Florida, and that's because almost 60 percent of the state's voters are expected to vote before Election Day, an increase from 40 percent in 2012. Even though we have Ohio as Lean R, and really only very slightly, Clinton isn't giving up on it. Some polls have shown the race to be within the margin of error there. The state has shifted slightly more in Trump's favor in the past two weeks, but the Clinton campaign is trying to mobilize voters in Democratic areas like Cuyahoga County, home to Cleveland. She has the backing of Cleveland Cavaliers star LeBron James, and the campaign held a concert focused on early voting, with Jay Z and Beyonce. \"I want my daughter to grow up seeing a woman lead our country and knowing that her possibilities are limitless,\" Beyonce said, backed up by dancers wearing blue pantsuits, a nod to Clinton's campaign fashion. \"And that's why I am with her.\" Early in-person voting in Ohio ends Monday. Political gravity and a race that has been, in some ways, very stable The contest between Clinton and Trump has been volatile in some ways, but remarkably stable in another \u2014 the views of both candidates remain largely unchanged since after the primaries ended. So perhaps it's not surprising that after the FBI's letter to Congress, all but reopening the investigation into Clinton's emails, that the race has snapped back to a natural position. FBI Director James Comey on Sunday closed the investigation for a second time, saying from what the bureau saw of the emails, he still wouldn't recommend prosecution. NPR's Carrie Johnson reported that the emails were duplicates of what the FBI had already seen. The FBI letter perhaps doesn't account for all the tightening in the past couple of weeks, though it certainly gave Republicans who were wary of Trump a reminder of why they distrust Clinton. Throughout this campaign, when a Trump controversy brewed, Clinton's lead expanded; but after a couple of weeks, the race slowly regressed to a natural position. Clinton's expanded leads \u2014 after the Democratic convention and the Access Hollywood tape just a couple of weeks ago \u2014 have proven to be soft. That's largely because of moderate Republicans. There is also a natural tightening that generally happens close to elections. Third-party support drops (and it has in this election), and people revert back to their party corners. There's no greater indicator of how someone will vote than how he or she has voted. It's a little like Thanksgiving \u2014 the kids might threaten to stay away, especially at tense family moments through the year, but most of the time, they go home. The NPR Battleground Map is based on a blend of historical voting patterns, demographics, on-the-ground reporting and polling.",

Polls show the presidential race in Texas is closer than it's been in decades. Some even show the two candidates within the margin of error. Does Hillary Clinton actually stand a chance in Texas? It's unlikely, but it could be closer than at any time in the past 20 years. The reason for how competitive the race looks lies in two demographic groups \u2014 Republican-leaning suburban women offended by Trump's comments about women, and Latinos, who are fired up to vote against him. Hillary Clinton waves to supporters at a \"Latinos for Hillary\" grass-roots event last year in San Antonio.\n                \n                    \n                    Erich Schlegel/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Hillary Clinton waves to supporters at a \"Latinos for Hillary\" grass-roots event last year in San Antonio. Suburban women cool to Trump Part of the answer might be found in the suburbs of Dallas. Jody Rushton is the former president of the Texas Federation of Republican Women and currently serves as precinct chair in Plano. This upper-middle-class, predominately white, suburban community is fertile Republican territory, and Rushton has been its party liaison for many, many years. On this day, she's walking her neighborhood for Donald Trump. At one house, resident Charlene Collins tells Rushton she's worried about the election. Rushton asks her what's motivating her to vote. Collins says one issue in particular is tipping the scale: \"Mainly it's the judges. I can tell you truthfully, this is a really sad situation for us to be in.\" Rushton agrees. Her first choice for president was Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. Like many Republican suburban female voters across the state, she will loyally support her party's candidate. But she knows others who hesitate and some who can't bring themselves to vote for Trump. \"Our candidate is not a politician,\" Rushton says. \"And, obviously, he's done things that are out there that we don't appreciate. There's no way I can condone what he's done and said in some of the areas. However, his words don't mean so much from 10 years ago as what he says he will do.\" This is the potential soft point for Trump's campaign: suburban Republican women. Carol Reed knows this all too well. She's been a Republican political consultant in Texas for more than three decades. She helped build the Texas Republican Party from a collection that could caucus in a phone booth to the powerhouse it is today. Reed says what's happening to the GOP nationally is happening in Texas, too. \"He has turned off women all over America,\" Reed says, \"and it really doesn't matter whether you are an R or a D. We're no different when it comes to that kind of thing. So, the soccer mom today, while she cares more about economic stuff, there comes a point where there's a bridge too far, and I'm seeing already in North Dallas a couple of the 'nasty woman' T-shirts.\" Reed believes Trump will carry Texas, but probably by a lot less than the 16-point margin Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney beat President Obama by in 2012. Reed is more focused on what happens to Texas Republicans after Nov. 8. \"If we see a huge split like I think is going to happen,\" Reed warns, \"if Republican moderates are driven further out of the party, and if the Republican Party doesn't change the way they approach people and sticks on these wedge issues, they're going to lose.\" Latinos appear fired up Carlos Zamora, with Mi Familia Vota, shows a voter registration card from a pile placed on the counter of the Tierra Caliente taco truck in Houston last month.\n                \n                    \n                    John L.

Democratic state Rep. Rafael Anchia from Dallas believes Trump's campaign could help change the balance of power in Texas. Anchia knows that in the past, Hispanic turnout in Texas has been a disappointment. But he believes this election is different. \"Where we stand today, Hillary Clinton winning Texas is very, very real,\" Anchia says. \"We have a candidate who has gone out of his way to alienate Hispanic voters. I think you not only going to see that at the top of the ticket, but you're going to see it down ballot. The efforts of Donald Trump and the Republicans, they're really delivering that vote in large percentages to the Democratic Party.\" The numbers from the first day of early voting in Texas were astonishing. Four years ago in Houston, 47,000 people voted on the first day. On Monday, 67,000 voted. In Austin, 16,000 voted four years ago; Monday, more than 35,000 voted. Every major city smashed its previous record. Something is going on. Texans just don't know what yet.",

Even after Nov. 8, no matter who is elected, many don't expect the partisan infighting that has highlighted this year's unusually ugly campaign to come to an end. But in an interview with NPR's Robert Siegel, Vice President Biden struck a hopeful tone, saying that Hillary Clinton and Democrats could be effective if she wins the presidency. \"I think when we appeal to the better angels of Americans, we've always succeeded. [Donald] Trump is out there doing something very dangerous,\" Biden said, pointing to a recent column from Charles Krauthammer. The conservative pundit wrote that \"such incendiary talk is an affront to elementary democratic decency and a breach of the boundaries of American political discourse.\" The 36-year Senate veteran argued later that even if Trump were to win, he might face opposition from his own party, many of whom have withdrawn their support recently as he faces allegations from multiple women that he forcibly kissed or groped them. \"I think you'll have first and foremost, [the] Republican Party saying how do we stop Donald Trump's policies,\" Biden predicted. The vice president didn't think that there would be traction to Trump's repeated claims that the election will be \"rigged,\" noting the Republican nominee said the same thing during the GOP primaries, which he ended up winning. \"There's one way to make sure there's no traction\" on the \"rigged\" claims, Biden said. \"Vote.\" Biden, who ran twice for president himself, had mulled over another run this election but ultimately passed. He was still mourning the death of his son Beau to brain cancer. He also talked to NPR about the cancer \"moonshot\" he is helping spearhead to try to find a cure for the disease. Biden said he doesn't have any regrets about not running and that it was \"the right decision for me and my family, and I'm confident Hillary will do a great job.\" \"Every election calls for a different set of attributes that are most sought after at that time, and right now it's how do we monopolize, capitalize on the progress we've made with this god-awful recession that brought us from crisis to recovery and now on the verge of real resurgence,\" Biden said. While he believes Clinton is the right candidate to do that, he acknowledged she has made missteps, especially with her private server she used at the State Department. \"Obviously they've hurt her campaign,\" Biden said. \"But there doesn't seem to be any there there. But that's why a lot of people thought it would have been better a year ago to say, 'Here's everything I did in my emails.' \" Regarding Russian hacking \u2013- U.S. intelligence believes Russia is the source for the emails of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, published recently by Wikileaks, and that Russia is also behind the hacking of Democratic National Committee emails in July \u2013- Biden said the intrusion \"warrants retaliation\" and the administration is trying to determine what type of measured response is appropriate. \"There are no rules. We're trying to, among the more democratic nations of the world, establish rules relating to cyberspace,\" Biden said. \"But it's clear that based on what the director of the intelligence community said, that the Russians are not engaging in any kind of effort to establish some rational rules for cyberspace.\" One major group Clinton has struggled to win over \u2014 blue-collar, non-college-educated, white voters \u2014 is one that Biden has been particularly strong with throughout his political career. He said that his party can do a better job of understanding their concerns and their economic anxieties. \"I think because we had to focus so much on keeping the economy from going over a cliff, we had to focus so much on rescuing people who were in extremis, that we did not talk enough about what I know \u2014 I'm middle-class Joe, I'm characterized as that, and I still get significant support according to the polls among those white, non-college-educated voters,\" Biden said. \"I don't think we've spoken enough about the plight they have.\" With Trump dogged by accusations he made unwanted sexual advances over the years, the former Senate Judiciary Committee chairman reflected on how he handled the Clarence Thomas confirmation hearings 25 years ago, after law professor Anita Hill alleged the Supreme Court nominee had once harassed her. Biden has come under increased scrutiny for his leadership during that time but said he would not have changed \"in a fundamental way\" how he ran those hearings. \"What Donald Trump did, I hope, is not a reflection of American public opinion, and the conduct of the vast majority of men,\" Biden said. \"I was a pretty good athlete. I spent a lot of time in a lot of locker rooms in high school and college. I never heard talk like that.\"",

Hillary Clinton on Tuesday rolled out a new tax break that, if enacted, would put more money into the pockets of working parents with very young children. The Democratic presidential candidate said she would push for a doubling of the current $1,000 tax credit for children ages 4 and under. An estimated 15 million children would be eligible. The new help would come in the form of a tax credit, which cuts the amount of federal taxes owed dollar for dollar. Translation: If you owe $3,000 in income taxes, but you have a new baby, your tax bill would fall to just $1,000. Even people who earn too little to owe income taxes would get cash back from the U.S. Treasury. \"It's just like the tax refund check that everyone else gets; it's dollars in your pocket,\" said Roberton Williams, a senior fellow at nonpartisan Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. \"It rewards work,\" because it starts to kick in with the first dollar earned on the job and keeps rising to the full $2,000 credit. \"It helps very low income families,\" Williams said. Under current law, families with children 16 and under are eligible for a tax credit of $1,000 per child. The credit phases out when income exceeds $75,000 for single filers or $110,000 for married couples filing jointly. Clinton's proposal is very different from Republican candidate Donald Trump's child care plan, which would provide most of its benefits as a tax deduction. In other words, such a benefit is worth more to wealthier taxpayers in higher tax brackets with youngsters in child care. Clinton's plan might be able to pick up some bipartisan support. For example, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio called for a child tax credit of up to $2,500 during his effort to become the Republican presidential nominee. What would it cost and how would it be paid for? The child-credit-expansion cost is estimated at $150 billion to $200 billion, spread over a decade. To offset that and other proposed middle-class tax breaks, Clinton would push for new taxes on Wall Street, the wealthy and corporations. The Tax Policy Center, which has been studying Clinton's plans, on Tuesday released an updated report, which includes the new child tax credit. It reached this conclusion: \"Her proposals would increase revenue by $1.4 trillion over the next decade. Nearly all of the tax increases would fall on the highest-income 1 percent; on average, low- and middle-income households would see small increases in after-tax income. Marginal tax rates would increase for high-income filers, reducing incentives to work, save, and invest, and the tax code would become more complex.\" The policy group said Trump's plans focus on tax cuts at all levels, but \"the largest benefits, in dollar and percentage terms, would go to the highest-income households.\" Those Trump tax cuts would impact the national debt. The Tax Policy Center said: \"Federal revenues would fall by $6.2 trillion over the first decade before accounting for added interest costs. Including interest costs, the federal debt would rise by $7.2 trillion over the first decade and by $20.9 trillion by 2036.\" The \"Tax Policy Center has wasted everyone's time with a fraudulent analysis,\" Trump senior policy adviser Stephen Miller said in a statement. \"The Trump plan is revenue neutral, massively cuts middle-class taxes, and has huge childcare benefits for low and middle-income families.\" Julie Wood, speaking for the Hillary For America campaign, said Clinton \"has been committed for a long time\" to expanding the child tax credit. Details were released now, because \"we wanted to put the numbers to it so that people can score it\" when they are calculating the impact on both family and federal budgets, she said.",

MICHEL MARTIN, HOST: We're exactly one month away from the election, and the big story out of politics today is about something that happened 11 years ago. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DONALD TRUMP: You know, I'm automatically attracted to beautiful. I just start kissing them. It's like a magnet. I just kiss. I don't even wait. And when you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything. MARTIN: That's Donald Trump in 2005 boasting to then Access Hollywood host Billy Bush while the two were getting ready to tape a segment. It was obtained by The Washington Post and released last night. Trump goes on to use graphic language to describe groping women and trying to pressure a married woman into having sex with him while he was himself newly married to his third wife. He released a statement on video at midnight apologizing for his remarks. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: Anyone who knows me, knows these words don't reflect who I am. I said it. I was wrong, and I apologize. MARTIN: But he then went on to attack former President Bill Clinton as he had earlier in the day in a written statement and delivered what sounded like a threat to address the former president's indiscretions in front of Hillary Clinton at the debate tomorrow night. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: We will discuss this more in the coming days. See you at the debate on Sunday. MARTIN: We're joined now by NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson. Hi, Mara. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Hi, Michel. MARTIN: So just last week, we were talking about Donald Trump's comments about women because it came up in the first debate. But this latest revelation seems to be having a real impact in a way that past comments did not. We've seen people pulling endorsements, for example. Why do you think that is? LIASSON: It's really interesting because these comments are different in degree but not kind. We have heard Donald Trump say denigrating, demeaning, offensive comments about women and other minority groups for months and months and months, but this time, he boasted about sexual assault. He talked about grabbing women by their genitals. And it seems this is a tipping point. Somehow or other, this one got Republicans really panicked. MARTIN: So talk more about the range of reactions among Republicans. LIASSON: Well, the interesting thing to me is we've been keeping a running count of how many Republicans have called on him to leave the race - not just condemned him because they've been doing that all along. We're up to about two dozen. And the most important ones on our list are Republican candidates - Senate candidates in battleground states. So Joe Heck in Nevada and Darryl Glenn in Colorado have both called on him to step down. So has Mark Kirk in Illinois, but Mark Kirk never endorsed him in the first place. Most other Republicans have either gone to ground, or they've condemned his remarks but not unendorsed. Paul Ryan, for instance, said he was sickened, but he's still supporting Trump. And I think the most interesting comment, the one that I think speaks for most Republicans' innermost feelings and fears is John McCain, who has withdrawn his support, but issued a statement saying quote, \"Trump alone should suffer the consequences.\" That is what Republicans really hope. MARTIN: Now, we know that there are Republicans who are calling Donald Trump to step aside. Like, for example, Carly Fiorina, former candidate, said that he should step aside. But is that even possible at this stage? LIASSON: It's very unclear if it's possible. GOP election attorney Ben Ginsberg was asked about this today on the NPR politics podcast. Here's what he had to say. BEN GINSBERG: People in the Republican Party are understandably nervous about a number of things. And so, yes, there are certainly people who are looking for an escape hatch at the moment. The rules do not provide a ready-made escape hatch, nor do the ballot rules in the different states, nor do the Electoral College rules. So that while people are looking for an escape hatch, in a very real sense, this die was cast in Cleveland at the convention that didn't become the brokered convention we talked about. LIASSON: The rules say that if a candidate is dead or incapacitated or voluntarily removes himself, yes, then they can put another candidate in his place. But so far, none of those criteria are in effect right now. And as a matter of fact, Donald Trump just tweeted (reading) the media and establishment want me out. I'll never drop out. I'll never let my supporters down. So defiance is now his brand. MARTIN: Obviously, there's an awful lot to talk about here, including the effect - the possible effect on other Republicans. But we have to ask you about the other political controversy of the weekend - the WikiLeaks release of what they claim are emails from the Clinton campaign. What's in there? And what kind of effect do you think that's going to have? LIASSON: Well, the alleged excerpts of her Wall Street speeches are what's in there. I think they are damaging to her. She does acknowledge that she's economically out of touch with middle-class people. She talks about her dream of having a hemispheric common market with open trade and open borders. And she talks about how it's good to have both public and private positions on issues when you're negotiating things. So probably those are some of the things she'll be asked about tomorrow night in the debate. MARTIN: That's NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson. Mara, thanks so much. LIASSON: Thank you. MARTIN: Please stay with us. We're going to talk more about this in the Barbershop. Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

The controversial whistleblower organization WikiLeaks on Friday released emails that they say are linked to Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta. While much of the new batch of hacked emails are benign newsletters and shared articles, one note in particular has gotten attention for offering a glimpse into Hillary Clinton's paid Wall Street speeches. The email depicts Clinton acknowledging the security issues with using her BlackBerry and suggests that she considers herself a political moderate. It also alleges that she dreams of \"open trade and open borders,\" among other topics. But some of the most intriguing excerpts come when Clinton is addressing issues of Wall Street while actually on Wall Street. In the hacked email, the Democratic presidential nominee discusses the \"rigged system,\" and the causes of and solutions to the financial crisis in an unguarded tone, framing large banks and investment firms as partners rather than problems. The email, sent last January from Hillary For America research director Tony Carrk to Podesta and other senior campaign officials, contain \"flags\" sent by the Harry Walker Agency \u2014 the firm that organized Clinton's Wall Street speeches after she was secretary of state. The flagged portions are positions that Carrk wrote needed \"an extra scrub\" and could prove problematic for the campaign in the future. While the Clinton campaign hasn't outright disputed the contents of the emails, they have not yet confirmed their authenticity. Podesta did take to Twitter questioning the veracity of some of the emails, though he didn't specify which ones. He wrote that he didn't have the time to verify which emails are true and which are fake, and he also blamed Russia for the hack, claiming the country has been issuing cyber attacks as a means to \"throw the election to Donald Trump.\" 1. While I'm in pretty good company with Gen. Powell & Amb. Marshall... 2. ...I'm not happy about being hacked by the Russians in their quest to throw the election to Donald Trump. 3. Don't have time to figure out which docs are real and which are faked... 4. ...But, for starters, Assange's first claim that I co-own the Podesta Group is completely false. In the hacked email containing excerpts of Wall Street speeches, the first flagged portion comes from a 2014 speech at a Goldman Sachs - BlackRock event and is titled \"Clinton admits she's out of touch.\" In the excerpt, Clinton describes herself now as being \"far-removed\" from the struggles of middle class life and acknowledges \"a growing sense of anxiety and even anger in the country over the feeling that the game is rigged.\" She does say that she had a \"solid middle class upbringing\" that she hasn't forgotten. Clinton also spoke of the \"rigged system\" in another 2014 speech to Deutsche Bank, saying, \"If the perception is that somehow the game is rigged, that should be a problem for all of us, and we have to be willing to make that absolutely clear.\" In public, Clinton has acknowledged that many voters feel the system is rigged against them. Just last week, she pointed to the Donald Trump's recently leaked 1995 tax returns as a sign that he embodies \"the same rigged system he claims he will change.\" Clinton also spoke to Wall Street repeatedly about the financial crisis and how to avoid it in the future. In an October 2013, speech at the Goldman Sachs AIMS Alternative Investments Symposium, Clinton said that blaming the banking system for the financial crisis was an \"oversimplification.\" \"I think that there's a lot that could have been avoided in terms of both misunderstanding and really politicizing what happened with greater transparency, with greater openness on all sides, you know, what happened, how did it happen, how do we prevent it from happening?,\" Clinton said. \"You guys help us figure it out and let's make sure that we do it right this time.\" In the 2014 Deutsche Bank speech, she said that Wall Street reform \"really has to come from the industry itself.\" In her Goldman Sachs AIMS Alternative Investments Symposium speech the year before, Clinton brought up a similar idea, saying,\"The people that know the industry better than anybody are the people who work in the industry.\" Clinton also highlighted her strong relationship with Wall Street while she was a senator during a 2014 speech at Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd, a securities law firm in San Diego. \"When I was a senator from New York, I represented and worked with so many talented principled people who made their living in finance,\" Clinton said, but added that she also worked to hold them to high standards, \"But even though I represented them and did all I could to make sure they continued to prosper, I called for closing the carried interest loophole and addressing skyrocketing CEO pay.\" Though Clinton has publicly called for tighter regulations on Wall Street, her tone in the speech excerpts contained in the leaked email are perhaps more conciliatory and friendly than she has publicly let on. RNC Chairman Reince Priebus zeroed in on this criticism in a statement: \"With today's WikiLeaks revelations we are finding out who Hillary Clinton really is, and it's not hard to see why she fought so hard to keep her transcripts of speeches to Wall Street banks paying her millions of dollars secret.\" However, the Podesta emails leaked the same day as a lewd tape of Trump claiming he could grope women because of his fame. As the backlash against Trump intensifies and more Republican leaders call for his resignation, Clinton's Wall Street speeches may not pack as strong a punch as Priebus had hoped.",

But how did the candidates get that message across to the economic middle when they themselves are wealthy? As part of our series The New Middle, we asked NPR's Tamara Keith to take a look at that. TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are not themselves members of the middle class, not by a long shot, which means they've searched for other ways to prove to voters that they care about their concerns and understand what middle class workers are going through. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DONALD TRUMP: Oftentimes they're working two jobs. KEITH: Trump says he's worth $10 billion. But at the Republican Convention, one of his sons referred to him as a blue collar billionaire. In a speech last month at the Economic Club of New York, Trump tried to show that he identifies with the challenges faced by the American middle class. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: So they're working harder, they're older and they're making less. It's like me, I'm working harder than I've ever worked also. But these are minor - nobody cares about that. That's - who cares about that? KEITH: Clinton and her husband, the former president, are of course by all measures quite wealthy as well, having earned tens of millions of dollars in book royalties and speaking fees in recent years. Which is why in speeches, she leans heavily on her family history. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) HILLARY CLINTON: I'm a proud product of the American middle class. KEITH: Her grandfather worked in a lace mill, and his son was able to go to college. Her father owned his own business making draperies, and his daughter was able to go to Yale Law School. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CLINTON: Every American family should be able to write a similar story for themselves and their children. And history has shown us... (APPLAUSE) CLINTON: ...Our history has shown us that the strongest growth in our economy is inclusive, broad-based growth. KEITH: The difference in the way Clinton and Trump talk about the middle class is stark. For Clinton, it's a story of hope. For Trump, it is a story of loss. This is how Clinton responded when I asked her to describe the middle. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CLINTON: The middle class is both real and aspirational. And I want to make sure that it remains strong and it gives people a sense of security and confidence and optimism about their futures. KEITH: Clinton has pledged not to raise taxes on the middle class. And by that, she means anyone making up to $250,000 a year. Her debt-free college, child care and paid family leave proposals are targeted directly at the things that have middle class families scrambling, and would be paid for with tax increases on the wealthy. Trump's campaign did not respond to a request to participate in this story. But this is what the Republican nominee said in his speech last month in New York. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: We have surrendered our middle class to the whims of foreign countries. We take care of them better than we take care of ourselves. KEITH: Trump was talking about trade deals he says have hurt American workers. As he rolled out the latest iteration of his plan for a massive tax cut, Trump claimed it would help the middle class the most. Nonpartisan tax analysts disagree. Trump has also stepped up efforts to appeal to suburban women with proposed tax breaks for childcare and paid maternity leave. But most of his campaign's message has been designed to appeal to workers without college degrees, left behind as the country's economy shifted toward skilled manufacturing and service jobs. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: They have been forgotten. We are not going to forget them. They have built our country. We will not forget. KEITH: Trump is asking middle class voters to go with a candidate who speaks to their frustrations. Clinton is asking them to pick her because of all the detailed proposals she's offered to address those concerns. Tamara Keith, NPR News. Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Much of the anger and anxiety in the 2016 election are fueled by the sense that economic opportunity is slipping away for many Americans. This week, as part of NPR's collaborative project with member stations, A Nation Engaged, we're asking the question: What can be done to create economic opportunity for more Americans? There are plenty of Springfields in the U.S. Thirty-three, according to one government count. The Springfield in Ohio is a blue-collar city with a lot of history, pain and pride: a place with an uncertain future. \"When you look at what makes America great, what makes America not great, our ups and our downs, Springfield represents all of that,\" says Kevin Rose, a historian with the Turner Foundation, a local philanthropy. For years now, the not so great seems to have the upper hand. \"Springfield is a rather typical small city that has grown poorer over the years,\" says Roger Baker, the city's mayor in the '70s and '80s. Poorer \u2014 a lot poorer. Median incomes fell an astounding 27 percent in Springfield between 1999 and 2014, more than any metropolitan area in the country, according to the Pew Research Center. Mike Calabrese has seen it closeup. He runs Opportunities for Individual Change, a job skills program in Springfield. \"Throughout the '90s we lost in Clark County, Ohio, 22,000 high-paying blue-collar jobs. We've never recovered from it.\" Jobs have come back to Springfield. The unemployment rate is pretty low \u2014 around 5 percent. But wages have been stuck in a trough. For many in town, a middle-class life is out of reach. And it's hard to see a way out. Take one of the big employers in Springfield \u2014 Navistar, a truck manufacturer. Jason Barlow, who represents Navistar workers for the United Auto Workers union, used to work on the assembly line. (Top) Workers on the factory floor at Pentaflex, a manufacturer of parts for heavy trucks, in Springfield. (Left) Kelly Curtis assembles parts at Pentaflex. (Right) Ross McGregor, the company's executive vice president, says many of the company's processes have been automated.\n                \n                    \n                    Maddie McGarvey for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption (Top) Workers on the factory floor at Pentaflex, a manufacturer of parts for heavy trucks, in Springfield. (Left) Kelly Curtis assembles parts at Pentaflex. (Right) Ross McGregor, the company's executive vice president, says many of the company's processes have been automated. \"When I hired in in 1995, I hired in at $17.65 an hour. ... Now an employee hires in at $15.68,\" he says. And that doesn't account for inflation. If you haven't graduated from college \u2014 and only 15 percent of the city's adults older than 25 have a bachelor's degree \u2014 the best jobs in town are still in manufacturing. But now they pay less than they once did, and they require more skills. \"People need to have a little bit more to be able to do the things on the shop floor,\" says Ross McGregor, vice president of Pentaflex, which makes parts for heavy trucks. \"We have processes ... that used to be completely driven by operators loading parts in and out. Now we have transfer systems. We have robots.\" McGregor points to a machine moving parts through a stamping operation. \"This is an automated assembly unit,\" he says. \"This is a process that required four operators before. Now only one operator needs to run it.\" All of the automation and keeping a lid on labor costs allow manufacturers like McGregor to compete with a low-cost country like Vietnam. But for workers, it's all part of what's put the squeeze on living standards. That squeeze on blue-collar workers \u2014 the march of automation and global competition \u2014 isn't just landing on Springfield. It's happening throughout the U.S. and the industrialized world. Rubble from where a factory once stood in Springfield. As the city transitions away from manufacturing, it relies more on low-paying service jobs like those at call centers and nursing homes.\n                \n                    \n                    Maddie McGarvey for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Rubble from where a factory once stood in Springfield. As the city transitions away from manufacturing, it relies more on low-paying service jobs like those at call centers and nursing homes. Gregg McGillivray has done different jobs at Pentaflex, where he has worked for 31 years. Now he loads and unloads trucks. He says he has made a good life in Springfield. But he can't imagine how it will be the same for young people. \"I think it would be very hard to be starting out with a family now like I did 31 years ago,\" he says. McGillivray chooses his words carefully, and they're pretty pessimistic. \"I don't think it's as good as it used to be. I just don't think it's as easy to get by in the world today.\" There's no doubt it's harder to get by in Springfield. \"We're in a tough time economically, trying to figure out how the new economy filters down to the majority of the population,\" says Warren Copeland, Springfield's mayor. As it transitions away from manufacturing, the city relies more on service jobs, like in call centers or nursing homes. But they don't pay well. So local officials are looking for something \u2014 anything \u2014 that gives the city an identity, a way to distinguish itself. Kids walk home from school in Springfield. The city's population has fallen over the years. Now many young people go to college and leave the city.\n                \n                    \n                    Maddie McGarvey for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Kids walk home from school in Springfield. The city's population has fallen over the years. Now many young people go to college and leave the city. One of them, quite modestly, is geography. Some trucking distribution companies have come to Springfield because it's convenient to two big interstates. And incomes did tick up last year. But that doesn't get Springfield closer to the knowledge economy of tech or finance or design. \"Quite honestly, that's a struggle,\" Copeland says. \"In Ohio, every city like us is in competition with Columbus, which is the go-go growth city in Ohio. They have the advantage of a large university, major medical facilities, a number of insurance companies. So they really have a lot of the well-paying paperwork jobs that are part of the economy that's performing well.\" Springfield's population is older, less educated and whiter than national averages. And that population has fallen over the years \u2014 from more than 80,000 in the 1970s to less than 60,000 today. Many young people go to college and leave \u2014 the brain drain. To help end the exodus, Springfield is banking on a revival of downtown. And on a recent warm weekday evening, a farmers market was in full swing as a good-sized crowd shopped for artisanal cheeses, locally grown produce and baked goods. The mood was friendly and relaxed. Exactly the kind of scene tourism and development officials dream about. Hundreds of millions of dollars have been invested in Springfield's downtown. And it shows. There's a new hospital, an ice rink, museums, a new brewery and a performing arts center. Molly Mattin pours beer at Mother Stewart's Brewing in Springfield. The new brewery, located in an old warehouse space, is part of the city's downtown revival that includes new shops and a farmers market.\n                \n                    \n                    Maddie McGarvey for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Molly Mattin pours beer at Mother Stewart's Brewing in Springfield. The new brewery, located in an old warehouse space, is part of the city's downtown revival that includes new shops and a farmers market. Kevin Rose, the local historian, says there's a big emphasis on cultural tourism that draws upon the city's history. Back in the 19th century, Springfield made more farm equipment than anyplace in the world. The Wright brothers patented their airplane here. And there's some notable architecture. \"So one of the big things we've had recently was the restoration of our Frank Lloyd Wright house,\" Rose says. \"A lot of our cultural tourism enterprise activities are based through that.\" A tire store on Selma Road in Springfield is near Many Pathways, an addiction recovery center. The center's Charles Rollins says it's in a \"pretty tough neighborhood.\"\n                \n                    \n                    Maddie McGarvey for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption A tire store on Selma Road in Springfield is near Many Pathways, an addiction recovery center. The center's Charles Rollins says it's in a \"pretty tough neighborhood.\" But less than a mile from downtown is a neighborhood where no tourist would venture. Charles Rollins welcomes me to Many Pathways, an addiction recovery clubhouse he runs with help from his twin brother, Michael. \"Drug and alcohol abuse hinder the people of this community severely,\" Charles says. The streets here are bleak, with dilapidated and abandoned buildings. Guys walk around looking lost or haunted. Some of them stop by Many Pathways for safety, companionship or to attend 12-step meetings. \"Definitely, an increase in young Caucasian men turning to heroin,\" Charles says. It's part of the opioid crisis sweeping this part of the country. Michael Rollins says addiction isn't just battering young people and their families. It harms the local economy, since addicts spend their cash on drugs and can't be relied on for steady work. (Left) Michael and Charles Rollins run the Many Pathways clubhouse for recovering addicts in Springfield. (Right) Mike Calabrese, executive director of Opportunities for Individual Change, a jobs skills program, says the city lost thousands of high-paying blue-collar jobs. \"We've never recovered from it,\" he says.\n                \n                    \n                    Maddie McGarvey for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption (Left) Michael and Charles Rollins run the Many Pathways clubhouse for recovering addicts in Springfield.

The drug crisis, and not just heroin, is hitting Springfield just as downtown revives and companies like the truck maker Navistar are starting to hire again. Employers say it's gotten harder to find job applicants who can pass a drug test. And it's not only big, impersonal forces like automation driving people out of the middle class. Self-destructive behavior holds people back. Mike Calabrese has as much perspective on Springfield's challenges as anyone. He has worked for the jobs skills program Opportunities for Individual Change for 39 years. And he says the multiple problems facing the city and young people here can be discouraging. \"But I get pumped back up when I hear a great story about a kid who got his GED and he's got job skills. He's legitimately working and bringing money into a household,\" Calabrese says. Blake Drummond works on a house in Springfield.

Blake Drummond is one of those great stories. He's 20, and a few years ago he was a high school dropout making $9 an hour in an unskilled factory job. \"We were assembling Corvette manifolds. And my only job was to just push two metal rods into the manifold,\" Drummond says. \"Every day, eight hours a day, two breaks and a lunch. But they wouldn't switch us around. Every day, I'm putting the two rods in. I kind of felt like a robot, honestly, just standing there doing the same thing. It was bad.\" After getting his GED and taking construction and building classes, Drummond now earns $21 an hour. He's supervising a crew renovating a historic building downtown. He enjoys his work and doesn't feel like a robot anymore. \"I always say I feel like I was a carpenter in my past life because I can just pick up a tool sometimes and immediately know what it's used for, what to do with it and how to use it.\" Tony Smith cleans an empty lot where a house once stood in Springfield.

            "article_content": "Donald Trump's presidential campaign is going into five more states with a new $10 million television ad buy. It's the largest for the Trump campaign so far, which has been relatively slow  to invest in TV ads, relying instead on free media coverage and the Republican nominee's large social media following. The campaign is now targeting the battleground states of New Hampshire, Iowa, Nevada, Virginia and Colorado, putting Trump on the air in a total of nine states. The campaign rolled out its first set of ads earlier this month in Florida, Pennsylvania, Ohio and North Carolina. The new Trump ad, called \"Two Americas: Economy,\" portrays Clinton's policies as bad for the middle class, while promising new jobs if Trump is elected. \"In Hillary Clinton's America, the middle class gets crushed. Spending goes up. Taxes go up. Hundreds of thousands of jobs disappear. It's more of the same, but worse,\" a narrator says. The ad buy comes at a time when Trump is polling behind Clinton in several key battleground states. In Colorado and Virginia, Clinton has a substantial lead in recent polls \u2014 so strong that a superPAC supporting her recently pulled ads from those states. In a statement, Trump spokesman Jason Miller took aim at Clinton for spending much of the week fundraising, saying, \"With Hillary Clinton off the campaign trail yet again this week and continuing to take many communities' votes for granted, we see this as the right time to show voters the benefits of an American economy under the leadership of Mr. Trump.\" The Clinton campaign responded later Monday saying that Trump's \"reckless approach to business has devastated working families and communities.\" \"He will do and say whatever is in his interest, even if it means swindling working families to make millions for himself,\" said Deputy Communications Director Christina Reynolds. \"Now Trump is promising the same reckless, self-centered approach to running the country's economy \u2014 with large tax breaks for the wealthy, and a plan that independent experts say would cost millions of jobs.\" Trump is also spending part of the week fundraising, with events scheduled on the West Coast early in the week.",

At a recent campaign stop in Philadelphia, Senate Democratic candidate Katie McGinty faced a tough crowd: 4-year-olds. \"Hi! How's everybody doin'?\" McGinty said, as she entered the Western Learning Center, an early-childhood program for local families. McGinty stopped here Tuesday to tout her economic agenda with a small group of local parents; but first, it was story time. McGinty selected \"King Bidgood's In The Bathtub,\" the tale of a king who refuses to get out of the tub. And just as he emerges from the tub, one of the children assembled at McGinty's feet shouted out: \"Eww, he's naked!\" And then, an adorable amount of chaos ensued. \"For the record, reporters, there is a towel around the king,\" McGinty said, laughing, as the teachers tried to quiet down the giggling group. \"I checked!\" Economic issues driving 2016 At a meeting afterward with mothers of children at the learning center, McGinty outlined her economic proposals, which include child care tax credits, paid family leave and a $15 federal minimum wage. It's clear that economic security is at the forefront of women's minds in this battleground state. LaToya Brewington, a married mother of two children, told McGinty how hard it's been for her family to make ends meet, even with good-paying jobs. She works at a local hospital. \"I cry so many nights not knowing how I'm going to pay for this, how I'm going to pay for that,\" she said, \"and I have a decent job. I make over $25 hour, and I still can't get child care assistance because I make that much. It's like if you've got nothing, you get it all, and if you've got a little bit of something, you get nothing.\" McGinty needs to maximize Democratic turnout in Philadelphia from voters like Sareeta Hoffman. A 40-year-old mother of five, Hoffman said support for higher wages is her No. 1 issue this November. \"Most likely my vote will be for [McGinty],\" Hoffman said. She had not heard of McGinty before Tuesday's event, but she felt like McGinty understood her struggle. \"My children are my everything,\" she said, \"and I like the fact that she's a parent and can relate to that as well.\" A different kind of security First-term GOP Sen. Pat Toomey is also campaigning on security, but through a different lens. Toomey has laser-focused his campaign on national defense and domestic safety issues. His support for enhanced background checks for gun sales \u2014 even though his bill ultimately failed in Congress \u2014 earned him the endorsements of two gun control groups, helmed by former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and former Democratic Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz., who was shot in the head at a 2011 constituent event. Bloomberg and Giffords are both household names who are influential among female swing voters. Bloomberg's group is airing a powerful ad in support of Toomey that features the daughter of the principal of Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. \"She died that day protecting the young children in her care,\" she says in the ad. \"When it came time to vote on background checks, Pat Toomey crossed party lines to do the right thing.\" McGinty has fired back with ads touting Toomey's A rating from the National Rifle Association. He has also won the endorsement of Pennsylvania's Fraternal Order of Police, which represents 40,000 law enforcement officers in the state. \"You have also shown a strong allegiance to the law enforcement community by fighting for legislation that helps protect law enforcement officers, while on and off duty,\" FOP President Les Neri wrote in a letter to Toomey. Rockin' the suburbs The Toomey campaign held a Monday fundraiser at the Dilworthtown Inn in West Chester, a mostly upper-middle-class suburb in Chester County. Chester is one of four counties \u2014 together with Delaware, Montgomery and Bucks \u2014 that will play a decisive role in Pennsylvania. Chester County Commissioner Michelle Kichline says endorsements from gun control groups help Toomey appeal to women in these suburbs. \"He is very rational,\" she said. \"He's very focused. I've seen him reach across party lines on a number of issues that I think affect not only all our residents but also particularly women and children, and that's important to me as a mother.\" Female voters here are often referred to as \"security moms,\" because national and domestic safety concerns drive their voting patterns. Carol Aichele is one of those moms. She's a retired local elected official who now works at nearby West Chester University. She also attended the Toomey fundraiser. \"I think Sen. Toomey's position with respect to keeping America safe is important,\" Aichele said. \"I can't think of any issue that's more important.\" Aichele, like many moderate Republican women in these suburbs, is unenthusiastic, however, about her party's presidential nominee. Recent polls show Donald Trump trailing Hillary Clinton by 40 to 60 percentage points in the Philadelphia suburbs. Aichele worries Trump could be a drag for Republicans down the ballot. \"We always worry about that,\" she said. \"You never can tell whether there's going to be down ticket or not. So, it is what it is.\" Seeking distance from the top of the ticket The Trump campaign has not walked away from Pennsylvania, despite Clinton's double-digit polling lead here as well as her leads in every poll of the battleground state since the conventions. Vice presidential nominee Mike Pence campaigned through the Philadelphia suburbs Tuesday. At a campaign rally in Pipersville, he endorsed Toomey. \"When Donald Trump and I take office we're going to work with members of Congress from here in Pennsylvania like your great Sen. Pat Toomey, who has got to go back to Washington, D.C.,\" Pence said to hundreds of cheering supporters. But Toomey was notably absent from the rally. He hasn't endorsed Trump in the presidential race. If Clinton stays on track to win Pennsylvania, Toomey is going to need women to split their tickets between her and him. There are signs he can do it. While Clinton has a sizable lead, Toomey and McGinty are running competitively, which means he is already winning over some Clinton voters. But McGinty has also taken a narrow lead in polls since conventions. The candidate who can win over undecided suburban women is likely to be the one who makes them feel the most secure.",

            "article_content": "Women are the decisive vote in the Pennsylvania Senate race, where Democratic challenger Katie McGinty is seeking to oust GOP Sen. Pat Toomey. They are competing for women voters worried about economic and national security. The battleground is the Philadelphia-area suburbs.  ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: Women often play deciding roles in elections, and this year, there may be no better example of their influence than in Pennsylvania. Hillary Clinton is leading Donald Trump with big leads from women in Philadelphia and the surrounding suburbs. But down the ballot, Republican Senator Pat Toomey and his Democratic opponent, Katie McGinty, are battling it out for the female vote. NPR congressional reporter Susan Davis hit the road this week to find out what's on the minds of women there. SUSAN DAVIS, BYLINE: It's story time at the Western Learning Center, in early childhood program on South Street here in Philadelphia. The guest reader is Democratic Senate candidate Katie McGinty. Her selection... KATIE MCGINTY: \"King Bidgood's In the Bathtub\" - woo-hoo (ph). DAVIS: It's about a king who doesn't want to get out of the tub. He eventually does, but that's when things go a little sideways at this campaign stop full of toddlers. UNIDENTIFIED CHILD #1: Now he's naked. (CROSSTALK) MCGINTY: For the record, reporters, there is a towel around the king. UNIDENTIFIED CHILDREN: Ew. MCGINTY: I checked. UNIDENTIFIED CHILD #2: Icky. DAVIS: Afterward, McGinty met downstairs with some of the kids' moms. It's clear economic security is at the front of their minds, like LaToya Brewington, a married mother of two. LATOYA BREWINGTON: I cried so many nights not knowing how I'm going to pay for this, how I'm going to pay for that. And I have a decent job. MCGINTY: Yeah, right. BREWINGTON: I make over $25 an hour... MCGINTY: Right. BREWINGTON: ...And still can't afford it. I can't get childcare assistance because I make that much. MCGINTY: Right. BREWINGTON: It's like either you have nothing and you get it all, and if you have a little bit of something, you get nothing. DAVIS: That's why McGuinty is campaigning this week on her support for childcare tax credits and paid family leave. She needs to maximize turnout in Philadelphia for women like Sareeta Hoffman. She had never heard of McGuinty before this event. She tells me afterward that McGinty's support of a $15 minimum wage won her over. SAREETA HOFFMAN: Most likely my vote will be for her because my children are my everything. And I like the fact that she's a parent, too, so she can relate as well. DAVIS: Republican Senator Pat Toomey is also campaigning on security but through a different lens. Here's a campaign ad a gun control group is running in his favor. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: My mom was the principal at Sandy Hook School in Newtown. She died that day protecting the young children in her care. When it came time to vote on background checks, Pat Toomey crossed party lines to do the right thing. DAVIS: Toomey's support of enhanced background checks for gun sales failed in the Senate, but it's one of the issues that is keeping this race close. It's earned Toomey the recent endorsement of two gun control groups run by people who could influence swing voters - former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and former Democratic Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords. Outside the Outside the Dilworthtown Inn in Westchester, I meet Michelle Kichline. She's a county Republican official here in this mostly upper-middle-class town. She says those endorsements help Toomey appeal to women in the suburbs. MICHELLE KICHLINE: He is very rational. He's very focused. I've seen him, you know, reach across party lines on a number of issues that I think affect not only all our residents but also particularly women and children. And that's important to me as a mother. DAVIS: Women voters in Philadelphia's four suburban counties are the decisive swing vote. They're often referred to as security moms. Carol Aichele is one of those moms. She's a retired local elected official who now works nearby at Westchester University. She also attended the Toomey fundraiser. CAROL AICHELE: And I think Senator Toomey's position with respect to keeping America safe is important. I can't think of any issue that's more important. DAVIS: Aichele, though, is undecided about Trump, and the polls show Trump is doing terribly among suburban women here. She worries Trump could be a drag down the ballot. AICHELE: We always worry about that. You never can tell whether there's going to be down ticket or not. So it is what it is. (CHEERING, APPLAUSE) DAVIS: The Trump campaign hasn't given up on suburban women. Vice presidential nominee Mike Pence campaigned Tuesday across the Philadelphia suburbs. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MIKE PENCE: When Donald Trump and I take office, we're going to work with members of Congress from here in Pennsylvania like your great Senator Pat Toomey, who has got to go back to Washington, D.C. DAVIS: Toomey has not endorsed Trump, and Toomey did not attend that rally. If Clinton stays on track to win Pennsylvania, he needs distance from Trump to win re-election, and that means convincing Clinton's suburban women supporters to choose him over McGuinty. And that support will go to the Senate candidate that makes women here feel secure. Susan Davis, NPR News, Pennsylvania. Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "Hillary and Bill Clinton outside their home in Chappaqua, N.Y., in January 2000. The couple paid $1.7 million for the home when they purchased it in 1999.\n                \n                    \n                    Chris Hondros/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Hillary and Bill Clinton outside their home in Chappaqua, N.Y., in January 2000. The couple paid $1.7 million for the home when they purchased it in 1999. Bill and Hillary Clinton moved into the White House in 1993 as a first couple of modest means. If they return in January, it will be as millionaires. Forbes estimates of their wealth range at $50 million; the Clintons got there through hard work, while also benefiting from their fame and their friendships. What they seem not to have done, contrary to Internet theories, is break any laws. \"The Clintons have always been very careful to walk about two inches inside the line,\" said Michael Johnston, a professor emeritus at Colgate University who is researching public perceptions of legal and illegal corruption. He said the wealthy have usually dominated American politics, and the system enables successful politicians to move up. \"Money is very, very familiar [in presidential politics] and so are the people who have it,\" he said. The Clintons built their wealth in two stages: first in Arkansas, and then on the East Coast after Bill's presidency ended. Arkansas As attorney general and then governor of Arkansas from 1976 to 1992, Bill Clinton was paid at most $35,000 a year. Hillary, a rising young lawyer and the governor's wife, became a partner at the Rose Law Firm; she also served on the boards of directors of Wal-Mart, TCBY and LaFarge, the American subsidiary of a French cement manufacturer. In 1991 she was paid $110,000 by the firm and $60,700 from the three corporations. Wal-Mart is now a donor to the Clinton Foundation. The Clintons invested, sometimes with help from friends. It brought mixed success and plenty of controversy. They borrowed to invest with friends in a vacation-home development called Whitewater. It triggered a scandal even as they lost money. Hillary had better advice and more success with commodities trading. Her guide was James Blair, a close family friend and a Little Rock lawyer whose corporate clients sometimes dealt with government agencies. He helped her turn a $1,000 investment into a return of nearly $100,000. The East Coast In 1999, Bill Clinton's second term was winding down and Hillary Clinton was preparing her Senate campaign in New York. They bought their post-presidency home, an 1889-vintage, five-bedroom house in Chappaqua, N.Y. It cost $1.7 million \u2014 also what it's worth today according to an estimate by the online real estate firm Zillow. The Clintons got a five-year, interest-only mortgage. By not paying down the principal, they would keep payments low until they were settled. The mortgage required a down payment of $350,000. For the borrowed amount, $1.35 million, the lending bank wanted some sort of guarantee. Again, a friend stepped in to help. Terry McAuliffe, a Democratic fundraising wizard and close friend of the Clintons who's now the governor of Virginia, put $1.35 million in a bank account to backstop the mortgage. The following year, barely a month after Hillary Clinton won the New York Senate race, the Clintons bought a second home: a red-brick Colonial, also with five bedrooms, near Washington's Embassy Row. The asking price was $3.5 million; they got it for $2.85 million. News accounts noted the sellers were registered Republicans. Zillow now values the house at $6.6 million. This was a period of financial stress. When Hillary Clinton famously said, \"We came out of the White House not only dead broke but millions of dollars in debt,\" she wasn't far wrong. The presidential salary of $200,000 had been overwhelmed by defense attorneys' fees for scandal investigations, the impeachment proceedings against Bill Clinton and action to suspend his Arkansas law license. Hillary Clinton's disclosure as a Senate candidate listed outstanding legal bills totaling between $2.3 million and $10.6 million. Her 2001 disclosure stated that she and her husband paid more than $13.1 million in legal fees \"for themselves and former staff members.\" By 2004, those debts had been erased. The primary money-making engine was Bill Clinton. In his first year as an ex-president, he gave 57 speeches, an average of more than one per week. He traveled from Salem, Mass. (for the standard fee of $125,000), to Stockholm, Vienna and Warsaw ($183,333 each), and Milan ($350,000). Their 2001 tax return reports $13.7 million in gross receipts for his \"speaking and writing\" business. An analysis by CNN early this year concluded that the Clintons were paid $153.7 million for speeches they gave between 2001 and 2015, when she launched her current presidential campaign. Also on the 2001 return, Hillary Clinton reported receiving $2.9 million, the first installment of an $8 million advance for her memoir, Living History. The contract was signed the day before she took her oath as a U.S. senator. Bill was already collecting a $10 million advance for My Life, and when Hillary stepped down as secretary of state, she got an advance of $14 million for Hard Choices. Subsequent tax records show both Clintons earning money as speakers and writers, and Bill also as a consultant. These have raised political questions: Why was Hillary giving well-paid speeches at big banks? Was Bill creating conflicts of interest for Hillary as secretary of state? But in 2014, the last year before Hillary Clinton started campaigning, their income from speaking, writing and consulting totaled $32.3 million. It's likely the speaking fees and book advances would have been smaller for politicians without the Clintons' larger-than-life reputations. Michael Johnston, the ethics scholar, said it's a symptom of the wealthy elite's rising prominence. \"We love the notion of the citizen politician,\" he said, but added this: \"You can't be a presidential candidate without some acquaintance with wealth and power.\"",

            "article_content": "Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton campaigned Monday with Vice President Joe Biden in his hometown of Scranton, Penn.  AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and Vice President Joe Biden had a homecoming of sorts today. For their first joint campaign appearance of the year, they went to Scranton, Pa. Both Clinton and Biden have family ties to the town, which sits in an important battleground state. NPR's Sarah McCammon reports from Scranton. SARAH MCCAMMON, BYLINE: At most presidential campaign events, the candidate is the keynote speaker. But today in Scranton, Hillary Clinton was the opener. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) HILLARY CLINTON: I'm here with the one, the only Vice President Joe Biden. (CHEERING, APPLAUSE) MCCAMMON: Biden was born in Scranton, as was Clinton's father, Hugh Rodham. Clinton said the visit was a nostalgic trip for her, and she reminisced about the neighborhoods where both her family and the Bidens have roots. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CLINTON: I was christened at the Methodist Church on Court Street. My grandfather went to work at the Scranton Lace mill starting as a teenager. MCCAMMON: A place, Clinton said, where employees were treated well and rewarded for hard work with good wages and benefits. Clinton seemed to implicitly contrast her family's middle-class background with that of her Republican rival Donald Trump, whose own father was a wealthy real estate developer. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CLINTON: I always remember I am the granddaughter of a factory worker and the daughter of a small business owner, and I am so proud of it. (APPLAUSE) MCCAMMON: Clinton talked up Biden as a fighter for working families and someone who's never forgotten where he's from, saying... (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CLINTON: So, Joe, I hope you know how much not just Scranton, but America loves you and your family. (APPLAUSE) MCCAMMON: That was clear as the vice president took the stage nearly stealing the show with his own memories of his youth in Scranton. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Hello, folks. It's good to be home. MCCAMMON: Biden was in typical form cracking jokes and effortlessly charming the admittedly friendly audience. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BIDEN: Matter of fact, one of the people on the reception line said, my aunt owns your house (laughter). (LAUGHTER) BIDEN: Tell her I'm coming. (LAUGHTER) BIDEN: I'm coming home. I was there when I was running, and up in the bedroom written on the wall still is Joe Biden slept here. (LAUGHTER) BIDEN: And then it said lived here. I'm glad they added the lived here part. (LAUGHTER) MCCAMMON: Biden praised Hillary Clinton as someone who understands people in Scranton and is made of the same stuff, as he put it. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BIDEN: And I want to make it clear that as Scranton has always had my back, we, in fact, all of us are going to have your back, Hillary. (CHEERING) MCCAMMON: Biden spent much of his speech going after Donald Trump, repeating his message that Trump is a person whose cynicism is unbounded, and who can't be trusted with the nuclear codes. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BIDEN: I was proud my son, Beau, served for a year in Iraq, came back a highly decorated soldier. I must tell you... (APPLAUSE) BIDEN: ...I must tell you had Donald Trump been president, I would have thrown my body in front of him. (LAUGHTER) BIDEN: No, I really mean it - to keep him from going if the judgment was based on Trump's decision. MCCAMMON: Aside from attacking Trump, part of Biden's mission today was to connect with voters here in a way Clinton has struggled to. He did that for Matt Gregorowicz, a 19-year-old college student and grocery store clerk from Catawissa, Pa. MATT GREGOROWICZ: He was incredible. Like, he just got down to our level, like - didn't make us feel like we were just a bunch of random people. He's from this area. You can't fake the fact that you're from this area, that you can relate to people. You can't fake that. MCCAMMON: Gregorowicz said he was on the fence about voting for Hillary Clinton until recently, but he walked out of the rally feeling confident about that choice.

            "article_content": "Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump delivers an economic policy address detailing his economic plan at the Detroit Economic Club.\n                \n                    \n                    Bill Pugliano/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump delivers an economic policy address detailing his economic plan at the Detroit Economic Club. When Donald Trump's daughter, Ivanka, introduced her father at the Republican National Convention, she emphasized gender equality, advocating for more equal pay and more affordable child care. That came as a surprise to some; those points made her speech sound more Democratic than Republican, as NPR's Asma Khalid noted. But now, the GOP presidential nominee is following through, offering the bare bones of a plan to help families afford child care. (And, as Trump told Fox & Friends on Tuesday, Ivanka was indeed a big part of the plan.) His proposal has some weaknesses \u2014 the deduction at its heart would mostly benefit middle- to upper-class families \u2014 but it also represents an evolution from the late-2015 Trump, who was at times dismissive of child care questions. What's in Trump's plan? Trump announced on Monday that his plan was going to allow families to \"fully deduct\" the \"average\" cost of child care. That would only benefit middle- to upper-class households, as economist Justin Wolfers pointed out on Twitter: By implementing his proposed childcare subsidy as a tax deduction rather than a tax credit, Trump effectively excludes all poor families. The difference is that a credit subtracts money from your tax bill, whereas a deduction reduces the income that you pay taxes on. Lots of Americans already pay no federal income tax \u2014 45 percent of households, according to a recent estimate \u2014 so what would help them more would be a refundable tax credit. The Earned Income Tax Credit is one example of a refundable credit, meaning if it makes a person's tax bill fall below zero, that person gets a refund. Among those people whom Trump's deduction would help, it would benefit richer people more than the poorer ones, because higher earners have higher taxes, as Michael Linden, an economics expert who formerly worked at the left-leaning Center for American Progress, pointed out Monday. 4. For example, a family in the top tax bracket would get a $400 subsidy for every $1,000 paid in child care costs. 5. Whereas a middle class family in the 15% bracket would get only $150 in savings for the same $1,000 in child care costs. However, after the speech, as many criticized the deduction, the Trump campaign described (albeit vaguely) a plan to help lower-income families. In a statement, the campaign said their proposal would benefit those families who don't pay federal income taxes by allowing those parents \"to exclude childcare expenses from half of their payroll taxes \u2014 increasing their paycheck income each week.\" They also said there would be a \"credit to stay-at-home caregivers.\" Trump said the next day that he'll provide more details on his plans soon. \"The exact details, and we have pretty good details, but the exact details we're gonna be announcing probably over the next two weeks,\" Trump told Fox and Friends on Tuesday. One big-picture reason this matters: childcare expenses may be helping to drive the growing number of stay-at-home moms, as the Pew Research Center reported in 2014. They noted that around 2000, 23 percent of moms weren't working outside the home, a figure that climbed to 29 percent by 2012. That means more affordable childcare could grow the labor force (the size of which Trump fretted about in his Monday speech). How does it compare to Clinton's? Trump's plan, as outlined thus far, has far fewer moving parts than Clinton's multi-pronged plan. Clinton has said she wants to limit a family's childcare expenses at 10 percent of its household income \u2014 for example, in some states, infant care can climb higher than 15 percent of the median income (and for single parents, the costs can be staggering \u2014 infant care is 88.5 percent of a single parent's median income in the District of Columbia, for example). Clinton would also aim to boost childcare workers' pay and boost spending on early Head Start. While Democrats have recently dominated the discussion on child care affordability, Trump could also draw from other ideas floated from the right wing. Aparna Mathur, a resident scholar at the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute, has proposed making the existing child and dependent care credit refundable, as well as \"allowing advance payments on the EITC, the child tax credit, and the dependent care credit.\" Trump's evolution on child care The Republican nominee's new proposal signals that he is trying to change his image and message surrounding family issues. In 2005, Trump notably told a radio host about his hands-off parenting style, saying that he expected his wife, Melania, to handle the child care, as Buzzfeed reported: \"I mean, I won't do anything to take care of them. I'll supply funds and she'll take care of the kids.\" He also has been dismissive of child care questions on the campaign trail. At a November town hall in Newton, Iowa, Trump said child care would be easy and inexpensive for businesses to provide, as the Washington Post reported: \"It's not expensive for a company to do it,\" Trump said during a town hall at a community college in this small town on Thursday afternoon. \"You need one person or two people, and you need some blocks and you need some swings and some toys. You know, surely, it's not expensive. It's not an expensive thing. I do it all over, and I get great people because of it... It's something that can be done, I think, very easily by a company.\" Of course, in his home state of New York, \"one person or two people\" wouldn't cut it \u2014 for a child care center with very young infants, there must be one caretaker for every three children, for example. Nor would \"some blocks and some swings\" \u2014 New York requires 35 square feet of play area per child (among many other requirements). Then in December, he brushed off a woman asking him questions about child care, as ThinkProgress reported: \"I love children,\" he responded, adding later, \"It's a big subject, darling.\" But child care has moved from a fringe issue to a major one in this election, and Trump seems to be paying it more attention. The narrative started to shift at this year's RNC, with Ivanka's speech. As Trump's poll numbers have plummeted since the DNC due to many unforced errors, he may be hoping that a more family-friendly stance can reach the voters who have abandoned him. UPDATE: This story was updated on August 9 to clarify that Trump was talking about the \"average\" cost of child care.",

The names include several people from the world of hedge fund and private equity firms, including Steven Feinberg, chief executive and co-founder of Cerberus Capital Management; Thomas J. Barrack, founder and executive chairman of Colony Capital Inc.; and John Paulson, president of a hedge fund company bearing his name. One major oil industry executive is on the list: Harold Hamm, CEO of Continental Resources, who made a fortune in Bakken Shale formation and is said by Forbes to be worth almost $13 billion. Among the real estate industry executives Trump named are Howard M. Lorber, president and CEO of Vector Group, and Steven Roth, chief executive of Vornado Realty Trust. The Trump campaign said in a statement that the team is comprised of the \"top economists in the country as well as the most successful industry leaders in finance, real estate and technology.\" \"I am pleased that we have such a formidable group of experienced and talented individuals that will work with me to implement real solutions for the economic issues facing our country,\" Trump said in a statement. He added: \"For too long we have watched as President Obama and Hillary Clinton have ruined our economy and decimated the middle class. I am going to be the greatest jobs President our country has ever seen. We will do more for the hardworking people of our country and Make America Great Again.\" He has an economic speech planned for Monday. He has not released detailed economic policy positions, but has proposed very large business and personal tax cuts and infrastructure spending. He has also made U.S. trade policy a central part of his campaign, saying he wants to renegotiate trade agreements and bring back manufacturing jobs to the U.S. Despite that, there is only one figure from the manufacturing world on the list: Dan DiMicco, the longtime CEO of Nucor Corp., the largest U.S. steel producer. Some of those Trump named are people he already has strong ties to, especially Steven Mnuchin, chief executive of Dune Capital Management, who serves as finance chairman of Trump's campaign. Among the only economists in Trump's inner circle are Peter Navarro, professor of economics and public policy at the University of California at Irvine, who has written about U.S.-China trade policy; and David Malpass, founder of the consulting firm Encima Global and a veteran of the Reagan and second Bush administrations. Asked on CNBC Friday about whether Trump has the judgment to be president, Malpass said, \"I think his judgment is great that the economy is supposed to do better, that the country can do a lot better than we're doing, and what we really need is a lot of change in Washington.\" Among the best-known figures on the list is Stephen Moore, founder of the conservative Club for Growth, and a frequent TV, radio and newspaper commentator.",

            "article_content": "Demonstrators in Philadelphia during this week's Democratic convention echo another presidential election year, 1968.\n                \n                    \n                    John Minchillo/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Demonstrators in Philadelphia during this week's Democratic convention echo another presidential election year, 1968. In so many ways, 1968 was a great year for middle-class Americans' wallets \u2014 and terrible for politics. On the one hand, gasoline was cheap and unemployment was low. Real estate values were rising, helping average homeowners build wealth. Good times! Still, many people were not feeling good \u2014 at all. In 1968, the tumultuous presidential-election year brought strident clashes at political events, third-party disruptions, calls for \"law and order,\" racial discord and worries about foreign enemies. Sound familiar? In terms of both the economy and politics, we seem to have a summer rerun playing out. Here are some of the parallels on the economic front: Of course, not everything is the same. These are two big differences: There's another difference: On Friday, the Commerce Department said gross domestic product, the broadest measure of goods and services produced in this country. rose at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.2 percent in the second quarter. In 1968, GDP growth was running at 4.9 percent. So on the surface, growth appears far less robust than in the late 1960s. But the current sluggishness is related to weak business investment. On the consumer side, personal consumption expanded at a 4.2 percent rate, much more in line with 1968. And there's plenty of evidence of that at retail outlets. The National Retail Federation predicts back-to-school spending will hit $75.8 billion \u2014 up more than 11 percent from last year's $68 billion. \"We are optimistic that overall economic growth and consumer spending will continue to improve,\" NRF President Matthew Shay said in a statement. So when you examine data over many decades, both 1968 and 2016 look like good years for average Americans. They sure beat the Depression of the 1930s, or the inflation nightmare of the 1970s or the frightful foreclosure years of the Great Recession. No year is perfect, but there's no doubt you'd be happier working in the summer of 1968 or 2016, compared with 1974 or 2009. So why such intense political discord, both then and now? These parallels may offer clues: Maybe this year's political discontent can best be explained by a theory known as the \"revolution of rising expectations.\" The phrase was popularized in the 1950s to describe global upheavals in the wake of postwar decolonization. The idea was that rising economic expectations can made people restless and more open to insurgencies and revolution than during tough times when people are just trying to survive. In other words, just as the summer of 1968's political tumult came in the midst of good economic times, this year's intense political debates are playing out in an economic environment that's better for average families than at any time in many years.",

            "article_content": "1 of 8 What does it mean to be middle class in America? Nearly a century ago, in Detroit \u2014 which was then the burning core of the country's middle class \u2014 the answer might have looked like a hot dog: a Detroit Coney, to be precise. At its most basic, a Detroit Coney is a kind of chili dog \u2014 \"a steamed bun, with a natural-casing hot dog, beef and pork,\" explains Joe Grimm, author of the book Coney Detroit. \"And on top of that hot dog \u2014 which should be grilled, not boiled, not deep-fried \u2014 goes the sauce, the most important part.\" All along the streets of Detroit, you see big neon signs advertising Coneys \u2014 a word that refers not just to the hot dogs but to the hundreds of eateries that sell them. Eateries like Red Hots Coney Island, which has been serving up Coneys since 1921. Owner Rich Harlan has been working there for 48 years. He says his great-aunt and -uncle started the restaurant after immigrating to Michigan from Greece. \"We are a block away from the first assembly plant that was made by Ford Motor Co.,\" Harlan says. \"That's how they got started.\" Indeed, the story of how the Coney became Detroit's signature dish is deeply entwined with the history of the city's auto industry. In the 1920s and '30s, Detroit teemed with workers drawn there by Henry Ford's promise of a $5-a-day wage. \"People came here from around the world to get that money,\" Grimm says. As a result, \"the [city's] occupancy rate went over 100 percent.\" Housing became so tight that rooms were sometimes rented for eight-hour stints \u2014 long enough for one renter to sleep while another occupant was working a shift at the Ford factory, Grimm says. \"They called that hot boxing,\" Grimm explains, \"because the sheets never cooled off. So you had all these men living here, and they didn't have any place to be when they weren't at work. So they went around the city looking for hot lunches, fast lunches. And so we had a lot of lunch-counter-style restaurants.\" Coneys blossomed in this atmosphere. As The Salt has reported, among those streaming into Detroit during this era were newly arrived Greek immigrants like Harlan's great-aunt and great-uncle. But before heading to Michigan, they first had to pass through New York's Ellis Island \u2014 \"not too far from the famed amusements of Coney Island, where Nathan Handwerker was already peddling his famous hot dogs.\" These Greek immigrants, Grimm notes, saw the hot dog as an all-American food \u2014 one perfectly suited to the demands of bustling Detroit. And hot dogs, he says, were a relatively cheap business to break into, especially for workers with limited English skills. \"So I think they said, 'We're gonna make the hot dogs we saw people eating when we got here, and we're gonna add this sauce to it,' \" he says of the Coney's signature chili sauce. \"If you go to Greece, you can't find a Coney Island. But you'll find something called a red sauce, and I think this is descended from that Greek red sauce.\" Coney fever took off. In the 1920s and '30s, says Harlan, Detroit workers with \"20 minutes or so for lunch\" would cram into Red Hots and similar Coney shops. \"You could see them swarming here to get two hot dogs,\" Harlan says. \"And they would run to the bar, which was across the street, get a shot and a beer, and then run to the plant and read their paper and eat their two hot dogs. Because they were not to be late or you got fired, back then.\" Carol Harlan, Rich's wife and co-owner of Red Hots, says that \"back in its heyday, this little Coney was open 24 hours a day \u2014 didn't even have a lock on the door.\" \"When they could hear that whistle blow at the Ford plant,\" she adds, \"they would put two Coneys in a bag and set them on the steam table. And the guys would run in, throw their money in a box \u2014 it was all honor system \u2014 and just grab the bag of Coneys and run back, because they were not gonna be late for work.\" This story is part of The New Middle, a series examining what it means to be middle class in America.",

As it turns out, it's not wrong. Last year was the first recorded year that middle-income families no longer made up the majority in America, according to the Pew Research Center. What this actually means economically is a mixed bag, but \"middle class\" in the U.S. has historically stood for something less concrete: the American dream. Between now and the election, All Things Considered will be looking at what it means to be middle class in America today. Here is a brief timeline of how the concept and foundation of the American middle class has shifted over the past century: April 1939: For the 1939 World's Fair in New York, the Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Co. commissions a one-hour film telling the story of a family called the Middletons. The Indiana family visits the fair and is won over by the Westinghouse exhibit's futuristic display of middle-class lifestyle and leisure. June 1944: The GI Bill (known formally as the Servicemen's Readjustment Act) is signed into law by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, providing World War II veterans benefits that include payments for education and loans for starting businesses.

January 1975: The Jeffersons premieres on CBS, running for 11 seasons and 253 episodes. One of the longest-lasting sitcoms in American television, the Norman Lear-created show stars an affluent African-American family adjusting to its shift from working class to upper middle class and beyond. January 1980: Beginning of the \"double-dip\" recession, which will last through November 1982 and hit the Midwest and Rust Belt the hardest. The economy is affected in particular by \"stagflation,\" in which high inflation is coupled with low or negative growth.

Each weekend, we highlight some of the best stories. History for people who like having fun! #NPRreads https://t.co/aRCrk22KGL There's way more to Louisiana than its legendary food and music traditions. It's a fascinating state that both lives in the moment and revels in the past. I'm always ready to live a little, so I couldn't resist reading this history of the Evangeline Downs race track when it floated through my Twitter feed recently. Evangeline Downs opened in 1966 in the small town of Carencro, just outside of Lafayette. It's the heart of Acadiana, a place dotted with names like Opelousas and Breaux Bridge. It's also horse racing country, as Alan Broussard and Conni Castille explain in their piece: \"For more than a century, long before the lights blazed above Evangeline Downs, South Louisiana's landscape was scattered with unsanctioned, rural dirt tracks, often adjacent to a barroom with a dance floor. When young Cajun boys weren't working their horses on the headlands of sugarcane fields, they were racing them, barefoot and bare-chested, at those bush tracks.\" With quotes from Calvin Borel, Lyle Lovett and Eddie Delahoussaye, this is no dry history of a long-forgotten local attraction. This is a fun cultural history full of personality and good times. So head on over to the Know Louisiana website, supported by the Louisiana Endowment for the Humanities, and enjoy getting to know a part of the country that's so much more than the stale Cajun and Creole stereotypes we often see in the national media. \"The people least likely to want upheaval are those who have struggled to gain access to the status quo\" #NPRReads https://t.co/j0qg8D4bdh Roberto Suro, a professor at the University of Southern California who often offers fascinating perspectives on Latinos/immigration/demographics, has a new piece in Politico this week called \"Clinton's Latino Firewall.\" And, it's a #MustRead for folks trying to understand the motivations of Hispanic voters this election season. Throughout much of the primary season, we got a glimpse of how indicative demographics were of voter behavior, and Suro explains why minorities, Latinos in particular, supported the conventional candidate in a year when so many voters were craving an \"outsider.\" His theory is that Americans who have historically felt excluded are more likely to vote for Clinton. He suggests that middle-class Latinos are more concerned with finding a candidate who will defend them than a candidate who is honest and likable. As he writes, \"What's emerging is a realization that the people least likely to want upheaval are those who have struggled to gain access to the status quo, and who have succeeded at least a bit.\" The carefree black man #nprreads https://t.co/2ftKfmNtTQ Last summer seemed like the rise of the carefree black woman. Now, The Fader's Killian Wright-Jackson is making a case for the carefree black man, with both living under the ever-present question, \"Can I live?\" Wright-Jackson describes being different than most black boys at his high school. His accent was Southern, he expressed feminine mannerisms and he had a closet that didn't quite resemble his classmates.' He was the other and he was carefree. In his piece, Wright-Jackson points to the systemic societal \"caging\" of black men and their ability to express anything other than coarse masculinity. He provides Odell Beckham Jr., the footballer who loves dancing on the field, Jaden Smith in his Louis Vuitton skirt and Drake's admiration of Lil Wayne as examples of black men who have been chastised for stepping outside of the hyper-masculine stereotype. Wright-Jackson even points out how the sexuality of these men becomes \"suspect.\" Because, of course a black man expressing how much he is in awe of a rapper like Lil Wayne means he is gay. But, the point that stood out to me the most was this: with the world looking down on black men, why make their self expression a burden? \"The men we love, the boys we love; they're dying \u2014 at the hands of police, private citizens, and individuals like Omar Mateen who use hate as a reason to kill. Who then are we to limit them in living their lives on their terms?\" ",

            "article_content": "Vice President Joe Biden traveled to Ohio on Wednesday to announce a new overtime rule the White House hopes will make millions more American workers eligible for overtime pay.  AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: Vice President Biden campaigned today in the battleground state of Ohio. He was promoting a new Obama administration rule that will make millions of additional Americans eligible for overtime pay. At a time when wage growth has been slow, the new rule is one of the government's most potent tools to boost workers' income. But NPR's Scott Horsley reports it's going to be challenged by some employers. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Biden dropped into the headquarters of Jeni's Splendid Ice Creams - a Columbus, Ohio, company that's made a name for itself with its generous compensation of employees. The vice president is a big fan of ice cream and also what he calls Jeni's commitment to fairness. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JOE BIDEN: There used to be a basic bargain in the country. If the outfit you worked for increased its productivity, increased its profits, you got to share in the benefits. You got to be a part of it. HORSLEY: The administration says it's trying to restore part of that bargain with its new overtime rule, which will make more than 4 million Americans eligible for time-and-a-half pay when they work more than 40 hours a week. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHVIED RECORDING) BIDEN: The step we're taking today is about something my dad used to always say. He'd say, Joey, a job 's about a lot more than a paycheck. It's about your dignity. And you're deprived your dignity, in my view, when you know you're working much, much harder and much, much longer than you're getting compensated for. HORSLEY: The new rule is designed to help workers like Joseph Guiragossian, a former retail manager from Chicago, who recalls working up to 70 hours a week during the holiday season, with up to 30 of those hours unpaid. JOSEPH GUIRAGOSSIAN: The way it was posed to me is that I'm a manager, and I should be salaried, and this is my job. HORSLEY: Guiragossian was making just over $30,000 a year. His white-collar manager's title made him ineligible for overtime pay. GUIRAGOSSIAN: You feel really important. You're like, I'm a manager. I'm almost living the American dream, in some sense, but when you get down to the nitty-gritty and you really - you really start realizing that it really wasn't much to be a salaried person. It ended up doing me worse. HORSLEY: Under the new rule, anyone making up to around $47,000 a year will have to be paid overtime if they work more than 40 hours a week. Labor Secretary Tom Perez says the rule's intended to restore some bargaining power to workers by adding teeth to a New-Deal-era labor law. TOM PEREZ: When I was a kid, you know, when my friends' parents were a manager, they were in the middle class. And they weren't in the middle class by chance. They were in the middle class by design because the Fair Labor Standards Act was designed to say that, if you work more than a 40 hour week and you have these additional responsibilities, you should be in the middle class. HORSLEY: The rule faces opposition from some employers who say it goes too far. David French of the National Retail Federation is asking Congress to step in and block the measure. DAVID FRENCH: Employees are going to lose flexibility. In some cases, they may even lose hours. They may be eligible for overtime pay, but it doesn't necessarily mean they're going to be making overtime pay. HORSLEY: Perez agrees. Employers have a variety of ways to comply with the new rule. They can pay overtime, they can boost employees' base salary so it's above the new threshold or they can limit time spent working to 40 hours a week while hiring new workers or giving part-timers extra hours to fill the gap. PEREZ: People are going to get at least one of three benefits. They're either going to get more money, they're either going to get more time with their family, or everybody is going to get clarity. HORSLEY: The new rule is set to take effect December 1. Scott Horsley, NPR News, Columbus, Ohio. Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Millions more American workers will soon be eligible for overtime pay under a rule being finalized Wednesday by the Labor Department. The rule says anyone who makes less than $47,476 per year must receive time-and-a-half pay for hours worked beyond 40 hours a week. That's roughly double the current threshold of $23,660. The measure is one of the most sweeping moves the Obama administration has made so far in its efforts to boost slow-growing incomes. But it's sure to face opposition from some business owners. According to the Labor Department, the higher income threshold will make 4.2 million salaried workers newly eligible for overtime pay. The rule could also benefit millions of others who are already technically eligible but not receiving overtime. \"Our whole mission here is about strengthening and growing the middle class,\" Labor Secretary Tom Perez told NPR. \"In order to do that, we need to ensure that middle class jobs pay middle class wages.\" The rule change is authorized under New Deal-era legislation called the Fair Labor Standards Act. As recently as 1975, more than 60 percent of salaried workers were eligible for overtime. Inflation and regulatory changes under the George W. Bush Administration eroded that protection, and today, only about 7 percent of salaried workers receive time and a half when they work extra hours. Managers at many retail stores and fast food restaurants making as little as $24,000 have not been eligible for overtime, even when they work 60 or 70 hours a week. \"The angst that people feel across this country is so frequently the product of the fact that they're working hard and falling further behind,\" Perez said. \"They feel like they lost leverage. And the reason they feel that is because in the case of the Fair Labor Standards Act, they indeed lost a lot of leverage.\" The new rule has been more than two years in the making. The Labor Department initially proposed an even higher income threshold of more than $50,000 but scaled that back in response to complaints that it didn't reflect pay scales in low-wage parts of the country. The new threshold will cover about 35 percent of salaried workers, Perez says. Some employers have welcomed the change, and Vice President Joe Biden will meet with one of those on Wednesday. But others complain that the Labor Department is moving too quickly. \"What our members have told us, what many other employers have told us, is there's not a golden pot of money out there sitting in employers' pockets where they can all of a sudden pay a lot more overtime pay,\" said David French, vice president of the National Retail Federation. \"Instead, they're going to make the rational change and they're going to change jobs.\" Critics are urging Congress to block the new rule, but any such push would face a certain veto by President Obama. Secretary Perez says employers have a variety of ways they can comply with the new rule when it takes effect Dec. 1. \"People are going to get at least one of three benefits,\" Perez said. \"They're either going to get more money ... more time with their family, or everybody is going to get clarity.\"",

The former teacher and chemist took office as president in November and has pledged to fight corruption. His nickname: \"the bulldozer.\" What's the best way to help out someone in need? Just give money? Or try to make sure they'll spend the money effectively? That's a dilemma that's faced anyone confronted by someone begging on the street. And it's an international problem as well. When rich countries give aid to poor countries, how do they know the money will go to good use? The Millennium Challenge Corporation has come up with one strategy. MCC, as it's called, is a U.S. government foreign aid agency created by Congress in 2004 to fight global poverty. Its mission says: \"MCC forms partnerships with some of the world's poorest countries, but only those committed to good governance, economic freedom and investments in their citizens.\" To be selected for aid that can help reduce poverty, countries are evaluated by a scorecard drawn from third party data gathered by groups like Freedom House, the World Bank and UNICEF. If there are concerns \u2014 say, evidence of corruption or a lack of democratic rights \u2014 then a country would not be eligible for an MCC compact. So far, MCC has signed compacts with 32 countries and handed out about $11 billion. The average compact is around $350 million. But partnerships do not always go smoothly. Of those 32 compacts, six have been suspended or terminated for falling short of MCC's expected commitment to good governance. The latest suspension is Tanzania. A $463 million grant \u2014 designated to improve the access of rural residents to electricity \u2014 was suspended this spring. It shouldn't have come as a surprise to Tanzania. MCC doesn't issue \"warnings\" says Beth Tritter, vice president for policy and evaluation, but there are \"open and honest conversations with partner countries when we take an action like this.\" The problem is that the country hasn't lived up to the MCC definition of \"good governance.\" An election on March 20 on the island of Zanzibar (a semi-autonomous part of Tanzania) was deemed \"neither inclusive nor representative\" by MCC. What's more, says Tritter, \"the Government of Tanzania has also not taken measures to ensure freedom of expression and association are respected in the implementation of the Cybercrimes Act.\" The question is: Is this linking of aid to government behavior a good way to encourage countries to change for the better? Tritter thinks so. A case in point is Malawi. In March 2012, an MCC compact that would have provided funding for electricity was formally suspended because of concerns about \"democratic rights and human rights,\" she says. When the president passed away in April, the new president \"took actions to deal with the human rights issues and fairness issues, the treatment of protesters, freedom of speech.\" The MCC board reconvened in June of that year and reinstated the compact. Sarah Rose, a senior policy analyst at the think tank Center for Global Development, agrees with MCC's mission statement. Rose worked at MCC from 2007 to 2010 in the department of policy evaluation. There are studies that show that \"aid could be more effective [if it is delivered to] countries that are well governed,\" she says. Although she concedes that this theory \"is not widely held as a complete truth.\" The steps to qualify after a suspension are up to the government, Rose notes. MCC does not provide a list of needed reforms. But in her experience, governments believe it is a \"mark of distinction\" to be eligible for MCC funding. So there's motivation to live up to the aid group's standards. Could an analogy be drawn to a parent who promises to pay for a child's college tuition if the child lives up to certain standards and doesn't get into trouble? Rose didn't think the analogy was appropriate: \"It's a partnership, an aid partnership. MCC provides a chunk of money to invest in poverty reduction and economic growth, and there are expectations associated with that chunk of money.\" On the other hand, Phyllis Pomerantz, a professor of the practice of public policy at Duke University, says the analogy is apt. \"If it's a partnership,\" she says, \"somebody is a junior partner.\" \"If your intent is to reduce poverty and promote honest growth, the [MCC approach] is not helpful,\" Pomerantz says. Consider the Tanzania example. The country is dependent on foreign aid but \"doesn't know under what circumstances and conditions a donor is going to stop giving money,\" she says. Meanwhile, she says, the rest of the donor community is still giving aid to Tanzania even if MCC stops. Cutting off aid in this manner \"sours [the donor's] relationship with the country,\" Pomerantz says. And if the reason for the cutoff has to do with elections, she says, \"this is a violation of their political sovereignty.\" She does agree that \"countries that don't have good governance don't use resources as effectively as better governed countries.\" But the relationship between governments and economic development is a \"chicken and egg situation\" that is much debated in academic circles, she says. Maybe good governance can help spur economic growth, she explains, but maybe if a country is making economic progress because of aid, \"a rising middle class and private investors put pressure on the government to improve and get its act together.\" So in her view, there's no clear answer to the question: Does the MCC approach work? There's been no definitive response yet from the government of Tanzania. Mujobu Moyo is an economist who is a research fellow at the Center for Global Development \u2014 whose specialty is managing natural resources in developing countries. She sent an optimistic e-mail, citing the comments of finance minister Dr. Philip Mpango, who's said that the government will engage with MCC to understand what Tanzania should do to be reconsidered. \"There is reason for hope,\" Moyo wrote. \"It is hard to doubt the sincerity of President Magufuli's intentions to bring positive change to Tanzania. His actions to increase accountability and curb corruptions within the government speak for themselves. He will take action, but in his own time. He's not the kind of man that can be pushed around.\" So she has faith that the president can restore freedom of expression and other citizen rights. And if that does happen, then Tanzania will have both people power and electrical power.",

Donald Trump has made various statements about his tax plan in recent days that have left some people pretty confused about just what he'd like to do. Here's a guide to interpreting his remarks. \"In other words, it's going to cost me a fortune.\" \u2014 News conference, Sept. 28, 2015 At a news conference at Trump Tower, Trump unveiled a series of proposals to dramatically simplify and cut business and personal taxes. The proposals would have reduced the top marginal tax rate from 39.6 to 25 percent for couples with annual income above $300,000, which would have meant big cuts for high-income people. A poster outlining Trump's tax plan, titled \"Tax Reform That Will Make America Great Again,\" hung behind him at a September news conference.\n                \n                    \n                    Dominick Reuter/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption A poster outlining Trump's tax plan, titled \"Tax Reform That Will Make America Great Again,\" hung behind him at a September news conference. Trump maintained that the cuts would benefit middle-class families and that the rich would actually end up paying more in taxes, because he would eliminate unspecified deductions and loopholes. Analysts who studied the proposals say they would increase the federal budget deficit by as much as $11 trillion over the first decade. \"For the wealthy, I think, frankly, it's going to go up. And you know what? It really should go up.\" \u2014 NBC's Meet the Press, May 7 Last weekend, during appearances on NBC's Meet The Press and ABC This Week, Trump appeared to suggest that he favors higher taxes on wealthy individuals. If true, it marked a significant departure from longtime Republican dogma on taxes, and many in the GOP were, to say the least, confused. \"Even this morning, you know, he's talking about changing his tax policy and raising taxes,\" said Rep. Sean Duffy, R-Wis., a Trump supporter. \"We want to button him down and say, 'Where are we going to go, Mr. Trump, if you're president?' \" \"I'm not talking raise from where they are now. I'm talking raise from my low proposal.\" \u2014 Fox Business Network, May 9 Starting Monday, Trump sought to clarify his remarks, with interviews in The Wall Street Journal and on Fox Business Network, among others. Trump said he absolutely does not favor raising taxes on the wealthy, or anyone else for that matter. But he acknowledged that in negotiations with Congress, he would almost certainly have to concede on some points, and his plan might have to be scaled back a bit. The rich would still get a tax cut, but it wouldn't be as big as he first proposed. \"The interesting thing about how Trump looks at this stuff is, he sort of compromises his negotiating position right upfront by admitting that he doesn't really think this is really his plan, and that's something unusual, something I've not seen from other political candidates,\" says Alan Cole, an economist at the Tax Foundation. Stephen Moore, a prominent conservative commentator and founder of the Club for Growth, who met with Trump several weeks ago, says he remains convinced that the candidate is committed to tax cuts. \"He told us in the meeting he wants to cut tax rates. He believes this is the way to grow the economy, and I take him at his word on that. I think that's been a centerpiece of what he's been talking about on taxes,\" Moore said. But Moore says he and other conservatives, including Larry Kudlow and Arthur Laffer, have met with Trump staffers to discuss ways to tweak Trump's tax cuts, to mitigate their impact on the deficit. While Trump hasn't actually endorsed their ideas, his staff seems willing to consider them, Moore says.",

Economists say that to a large degree, the decline in middle incomes reflects the loss of factory jobs. Studies have been showing for years that this country's middle class is shrinking. Now, the nonpartisan Pew Research Center has added another dimension to the story: Its examination of government data shows the problem is not confined to the Rust Belt or Appalachia. In fact, the middle is shrinking from coast to coast. Middle-class families are \"losing ground in the vast majority of metropolitan areas in the country,\" with 203 out of 229 U.S. metropolitan areas seeing a decline in middle-income households from 2000 to 2014, the Pew study said. About 3 out of 4 Americans live in those 229 metro areas. Here's an important point: The change is not just a consequence of people getting poorer. Rather, the study found that while some Americans are falling from the middle to the lower class, others are rising from the middle into the upper-income households. So while 160 metropolitan areas saw an increase in the share of households with lower incomes, 172 metropolitan areas had an increase in the share considered upper income. With so many people either moving up \u2014 or down \u2014 the middle has been getting whittled away. In general, economists say the trends reflect the loss of well-paying factory jobs and the growth of high-paying positions for college graduates. The study singles out Springfield, Ohio, as an example of a town that has been losing its middle class because of the erosion of factory jobs, not because of a surge in college degrees. The shutdown of factories \"definitely has been hard on everyone here\" in the southwestern Ohio town, said Josh Rider, co-owner of Kid Enterprises, a small business. Rider's company provides coffee services to factories and offices in the Springfield area. As plants have closed, his coffee business has felt it. \"For me personally \u2014 I've been through it,\" he said in a phone conversation. \"But at this point, people have gotten used to it now, so it's normal\" to have less income, he said. He doesn't expect the lost blue-collar jobs to return. And he sees better educated and higher skilled Ohioans doing well while others fall behind. \"You either have money or you don't,\" Rider said. Pew defines middle-income households as those having three people and an annual income between about $42,000 to $125,000, adjusted for the cost of living in a metro area and the number of household members. Overall, between 2000 and 2014, \"the share of adults in the upper-income tier increased from 17 percent to 20 percent, and the share of adults in the lower-income tier increased from 28 percent to 29 percent,\" Pew said. While the loss of manufacturing jobs has hurt Springfield, the cities with the largest middle classes remain located in the upper Midwest. So many cities in Wisconsin and Indiana, which still have many manufacturing jobs, are hanging on to their middle-income households. The cities with high concentrations of low-income households tend to be located in the Southwest along the border with Mexico, and in the South, where furniture and textile jobs have disappeared. Metro areas with lots of upper-income households are more likely to be located in the Northeast \u2014 from Boston to Washington, D.C. \u2014 or along the West Coast. Economists generally say that income inequality slows overall economic growth by reducing middle-class buying power.",

Bernie Sanders has some of the most ambitious and sweeping policy proposals of all the presidential candidates. His campaign has centered on a promise of \"revolution.\" But revolution would be really expensive, according to a new report. The Tax Policy Center estimated on Monday that Sanders' taxation-and-spending plans \u2014 including outlays for programs like Medicare for all and free college tuition \u2014 would together add $18 trillion to the national debt over a decade. In addition, the center's Howard Gleckman wrote, it would add $3 trillion in interest costs. He called it an \"unprecedented increase in government borrowing.\" The center had already estimated that Sanders' tax plan alone would add $15.3 trillion in revenue over 10 years. What happens to that big bump in revenue? The main expense: Sanders' health care plan. The Health Policy Center (like TPC, a project of the Urban Institute, a D.C. think tank) estimated that Sanders' health proposal would cost the government an additional $32 trillion to what it pays now. That's well more than twice as much as the Sanders campaign says the health plan would cost. The campaign put it at $13.8 trillion over a decade. Bigger benefits for the 95 percent; big tax hikes on wealthiest According to TPC, Sanders' plans would increase taxes across the board, but they would provide bigger benefits than tax hikes for many Americans as well, particularly the lowest-income. People in the bottom 20 percent of income would pay an average of $209 more in taxes, for example, but receive nearly $10,300 in benefits, on average. Benefits would outweigh the tax costs for the bottom 95 percent in TPC's breakdown. The highest-income people, meanwhile, would pay in a lot more than they'd receive. On average, people in the top 5 percent would pay $130,275 more in taxes and receive $19,281 more in benefits. Hillary Clinton had attacked Sanders earlier in the campaign for calling for a \"tax hike on middle-class families.\" However, the Sanders campaign countered that the plan would ultimately save people money, giving them \"better care at less cost,\" as Politico reported in November. Sanders' plan might benefit lots of people on the individual level, but according to TPC, the additional spending could cause broader macroeconomic problems. According to Roberton Williams, a fellow at the center, the effects of this level of government spending would \"undoubtedly be pretty severely negative,\" as it could crowd out private investment, raise interest rates and slow down economic growth. 'Wildly overestimates the cost'? In a statement, the Sanders campaign said TPC \"wildly overestimates the cost of Senator Sanders' health care plan,\" saying that the center \"underestimates the savings in administration, paperwork, and prescription drug prices\" that the U.S. might realize under Sanders' plan. In addition, the Sanders campaign said TPC assumed state and local governments would stop spending on health care and just hand over their obligations to the federal government. Gunnels said that under Sanders' plan, state and local governments would keep spending at current levels. The center's estimate isn't really comparable with its other analyses of candidate plans, because this one includes both Sanders' taxation and spending plans. TPC has analyzed most other major candidates' tax plans, for example, but not the accompanying spending (or spending-cut) plans. For example, the center measured that Donald Trump's tax plan would cost the government $9.5 trillion in revenues over 10 years. However, they did not know exactly how Trump would cut spending to try to offset those revenues. (When Fox's Chris Wallace pressed him on this in one debate, Trump didn't have a full explanation.) Likewise, the center estimated that Clinton's plans would bring in $1.1 trillion over 10 years. But, according to TPC fellow Williams, because the Clinton camp hasn't released all of its tax proposals in one go, it's hard to compare her plans to Sanders'. For example, when the center estimated Clinton's tax plan in March, it noted that a middle- and low-income tax cut was still coming.",

            "article_content": "Voters in Indiana are at the polls Tuesday in a presidential primary that could largely determine the outcome of the GOP race, while Bernie Sanders fights on to influence Democrats.  AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: Republicans and Democrats in Indiana vote for presidential candidates today, and to explain what's the - what this race means in a national context, we're joined by Mara Liasson, NPR's national political correspondent. And Mara, to start, why has Indiana become such an important state for the Republicans in particular? MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: This is the last stand of the stop-Trump movement. If Trump performs in Indiana as he's been polling and wins pretty big, that will probably dry up the money behind the stop-Trump movement, and it will be a huge psychological blow to Ted Cruz. Cruz has said Indiana is do or die for him, but he's also said, I'm in it for the distance. Now, both of those things can't be true. It doesn't necessarily mean that Cruz will drop out, but for Cruz, the goal of stopping Trump from getting 1,237 delegates before the convention - that dream will probably die if he can't win Indiana tonight because Trump is just simply so close to the number. CORNISH: And in the meantime, there's been this really strange dustup between Donald Trump and Ted Cruz where Trump essentially repeated and unfounded, unverified National Enquirer story that suggests, of all things, that Ted Cruz's father might have known JFK's assassin. Now, what do you make of Trump picking up this line of attack? LIASSON: Well, this is really extraordinary. Trump calls himself the presumptive nominee. He's been talking about unifying the party. He almost has the nomination sewed up. So why not be magnanimous and conciliatory? He brought up the story unprompted, took it as total truth, suggested that Ted Cruz's father somehow was involved with Lee Harvey Oswald. And why would he do that on a day - on a week when so many parts of the Republican establishment are accepting his inevitability? They're coming to accept him as the nominee, talking about, now is the time to unite the party. So why would he do this? CORNISH: What are the running theories? LIASSON: One explanation is he just can't help himself. But it does suggest that the general election is going to be like this. He's talked a lot about pivoting to being more presidential, but he hasn't actually done that. And the question is, will Hillary Clinton respond the way that Ted Cruz did today by saying that Trump was amoral and a pathological liar and a serial philanderer? Or will she find another way of responding to him and making the contrast? CORNISH: Speaking of Hillary Clinton, what could happen today in Indiana's Democratic race? LIASSON: Her campaign has been downplaying Indiana, suggesting that she very well might lose there. If Bernie Sanders wins Indiana, he gets a little bit of oxygen. He gets to say he has some momentum. But he doesn't get to change the math. Hillary Clinton could lose all of the remaining contests by 20 points, including tonight's, and still win the nomination. CORNISH: Right. She's already moved on from Indiana (laughter), and she's campaigned in West Virginia today. And that's a state that Democrats have very little reason to hope for in the general election. Am I right about that? I mean, why is she there? LIASSON: Well, she's there for three reasons. First of all, there are upcoming primaries in West Virginia and in Kentucky, and she also on this trip went into the coal country part of Ohio, which is a big battleground state. And she is trying - and the third reason is that she's trying to correct the record about a very unfortunate statement she made previously where she said, we're going to put a lot of coal miners out of work. She said that that was taken out of context. But she made a speech in Athens, Ohio, today where she offered a very heartfelt mea culpa. She said she wanted to come to this region where Democrats don't do very well to say directly to the people of Appalachia that she doesn't disrespect them, that she will fight for their families even if they don't vote for her and that she wouldn't overpromise but that she'd would work hard to make sure that people everywhere, including Appalachia, have a chance to get jobs that pay enough to stay in the middle class, to create strong communities that you can grow up in and grow old in. And this was a warmer, more authentic Hillary Clinton than we've seen recently and may be the beginning of a pivot to a more effective general election message. CORNISH: That's NPR's Mara Liasson.

            "article_content": "California Republicans are holding their state convention this weekend. It's a chance for Donald Trump, Ted Cruz and John Kasich to make their case to party leaders.  RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: This is WEEKEND EDITION from NPR News. I'm Rachel Martin. In most election years, the nominating contest is generally wrapped up by the time California's June primary rolls around. But in this election season where nothing is normal, California is a crucible where Donald Trump will either clinch the nomination or where his rivals will stop him and force an open convention. And that's where we found the three remaining GOP candidates this weekend, in California wooing the party loyalists at the state Republican Convention. NPR's Ina Jaffe was there too. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) INA JAFFE, BYLINE: You could say that Donald Trump drew the biggest crowds if you count the hundreds of protesters that surrounded the convention site and delayed his arrival. In the meantime, Trump supporter Luisa Aranda said she, too, had been confronted by protesters on her way into the convention. Maybe it was her T-shirt that said Latinos for the wall. LUISA ARANDA: Yelling in my face, calling me a traitor, a sellout. How could I be there? I should be joining them. And I said no, my problem is I'm tired of the middle class paying for people like you. JAFFE: When Trump finally arrived, he had little to say about immigration or the border wall he wants to build or really anything you would call an issue. Mainly, he touted his many recent victories and treated his winning the nomination as a done deal. Still, he complained about delegates being, quote, \"bought\" and said he'd been unfairly treated by the nomination process. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DONALD TRUMP: It's a rigged system. It's a rigged system, OK? It's a horrible, horrible, disgusting system. JAFFE: That evening, John Kasich delivered a warmer message about helping people with mental illness and drug addiction and working with Democrats. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JOHN KASICH: And I don't know about you, but I'm worried about a divided, polarized country. JAFFE: Speaking to reporters, Kasich was even more blunt about the divisions he feels Trump is exploiting. A Trump candidacy, he said, would be a disaster. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KASICH: Do the Republicans actually think that they can win an election by scaring every Hispanic in this country to death, scaring them to the point where they're afraid their families are going to be torn apart and disrupted? Do you have any idea what those folks are going to do in a general election? JAFFE: In California, Latinos began deserting the Republican party more than 20 years ago. That's when former Republican Gov. Pete Wilson backed Proposition 187. The initiative denied public services and education to immigrants without documentation. Well, Saturday, Wilson made a surprise appearance at the convention. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PETE WILSON: And I am here today to announce to you my wholehearted endorsement and my wholehearted support of that winning Republican leader who will be the next president of the United States, Ted Cruz. (APPLAUSE) JAFFE: When Cruz spoke, he reminded supporters that the only way he'll be nominated is if Trump is stopped in California, where delegates are doled out based on the winners of each congressional district. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TED CRUZ: We are all in. We are going to be competing for all 172 delegates in California in all 53 congressional districts. It is going to be a battle on the ground, district by district by district. JAFFE: In the evening, Carly Fiorina, Cruz's running mate if he gets the nomination, did not mince words, telling California Republicans that in this three-way contest, a vote for Kasich is the same as a vote for Trump. And a vote for Trump is the same as a vote for Hillary Clinton. Both, she said, represent the establishment. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CARLY FIORINA: He will not challenge the system. He will not fight the system. He is the system. He will protect it. He will preserve it. And he will use it to his own benefit, which is what he has done all his life. JAFFE: If this Republican Convention is a preview of what's to come, California voters should have a bloody political battle to witness over the next few weeks.

            "article_content": "Indiana is the leading manufacturing state in the country. In one corner is Gary, an old steel city with roots to Donald Trump, who tried to jumpstart the city's economy in the late 1990s and early 2000s. And about two hours south is Kokomo, an old auto town resuscitated by the Obama Chrysler bailout. But the presidential politics of these two towns don't exactly align with their benefactors.  AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: The country's number one manufacturing state is Indiana. It's home to Gary and Kokomo - two cities with very different economic fortunes. NPR's Asma Khalid reports that those economic fortunes affect presidential politics in an unexpected way. ASMA KHALID, BYLINE: We're going to take a road trip to two cities. First stop - Gary, Ind., a city built by U.S. Steel on the shores of Lake Michigan. In the 1970s, tens of thousands of people worked in the mills. But like other steel cities, it got rusty. Jobs were lost, buildings abandoned. Then, in the '90s, a businessman came in and promised a new future. CHUCK HUGHES: I met him. And, you know, I mean, at the time, everybody was excited, man. It was rumbling - man, Trump's coming. Donald Trump, you know - hey, I was excited like everybody else. KHALID: That's Chuck Hughes. He was a city councilman when Donald Trump got a license to build a casino in Gary. HUGHES: Trump promised that he'd build the tallest, greatest hotels. I heard him say this out of his own mouth. KHALID: But Hughes says, that was just talk. He drives me to the harbor to show me. HUGHES: That's the hotel over there. KHALID: This hotel looks more like a motel - a drab shade of tan with boxy windows, no gilded walls or crystal chandeliers. HUGHES: Yeah, I mean, he didn't stick around long enough to make an impact in this community. No, he left. I mean, he left (laughter). KHALID: Trump ran the casino here for about a decade before he sold it. And that was not his only investment. Twice he brought the Miss USA pageant here. Trump came to Gary during dark days. There was high crime and few jobs. But most people in the city don't think Trump's investments paid off. Gary is still struggling. There are weeds growing out of boarded-up houses on nearly every block. But it wasn't always this way. SAM WOODS: You know, all you really needed was a strong back and do what you're told. KHALID: Sam Woods started working in the steel mill here in the early 70s. WOODS: Jobs were so plentiful, if you got fired from one steel mill, you can go and put an application and get started working the next week at another steel mill in northwest Indiana. KHALID: But now, he says, those middle-class jobs are disappearing. Fewer people work in the mills. Woods is one of the lucky ones who still has a job here, and he's a longtime Democrat. WOODS: Bill Clinton was one of the best presidents we've ever had, but he sucker-punched us. The worst thing he did was he pushed NAFTA. KHALID: Woods thinks Hillary Clinton will also try to push through trade deals like TPP that will hurt manufacturing. And so he's going to vote for Bernie Sanders. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) KHALID: On this weekend, the mayor, Karen-Freeman Wilson, is talking up Hillary Clinton at a black church. After the service, I meet her outside. And she says Trump's investments in Gary taught them a lesson about the businessman-turned-candidate. KAREN-FREEMAN WILSON: He's gotten in, pulled as much equity as he can out of a project and gone on to the next thing. You have to have a long attention span if you're the president. I just don't think he has it. KHALID: These days, gaming is one of the major employers around here. But for Trump and his early investments, there are no fond memories. (SOUNDBITE OF CAR DOOR CLOSING) KHALID: Let's drive two hours south to another manufacturing hub - Howard County. The auto bailout pushed by President Obama had a direct impact here. So we're driving around the main Chrysler transmission plant in Kokomo, Ind., and it's massive - kind of like island on the southeast edge of town. Thousands of people work here. I mean, even on the weekends there are loads of cars in the parking lot. But there was a point in 2009 when unemployment was around 20 percent. And these parking lots - they were pretty empty. This city got hammered during the recession. Randy Rusch used to work for the auto electronics company Delco. I met him at this popular local brewery. RANDY RUSCH: I just remember when I got, you know, notified that I was let go, 800 people were let go on the same day. KHALID: He came here the day he got laid off. RUSCH: So there were a bunch of people meeting right here, so their - that whole bar section was full of people, all of whom were leaving Delco. KHALID: People in Kokomo say the city felt like a ghost town. But then in 2008 and 2009, the federal government intervened with the auto bailout. It rescued Chrysler and GM - two major employers here. And the unemployment rate now is down below 5 percent. Rusch is a conservative planning to vote for Ted Cruz. And he tells me he feels conflicted about the bailout. RUSCH: It's like, you know, you sort of see - I see the negatives here. I see some positives here. KHALID: His pension got cut, and he blames the Obama administration for that. There are, of course, plenty of Democrats around here who say the auto bailout saved Kokomo from a depression. But there are also union guys, like Ted Kenworthy . TED KENWORTHY: A lot of guys, they - when they hear me say this, I really catch a lot of flak. They want to say, well, if wasn't for Obama, we wouldn't even have a job. And I go, bull. That is not - I don't believe that. KHALID: Kenworthy says Chrysler would have survived without help from Washington. KENWORTHY: We would have been better off had they let us go through the regular process of bankruptcy and come back and build our company back up instead of the government stepping in and bailing us out. KHALID: Kenworthy did not vote for Obama and neither did most of Howard County. Despite the auto industry's recovery, in the last election, Obama lost this county by about 15 points. Kenworthy plans to vote Tuesday. He's still undecided, but he knows for sure whom he will not vote for. KENWORTHY: I will not vote for Hillary. I think she could probably be the worst thing this country has ever seen. KHALID: Kenworthy wants a Republican in the White House. KENWORTHY: She scares me to death. She's too much of a liberal. Put people to work. Quit giving people everything. KHALID: And so even though Hillary Clinton is the candidate running on President Obama's record and the legacy of the auto bailout, some people here will not support her. And maybe that's the lesson of these two cities - economic investment, in Donald Trump or President Obama's case, isn't always enough to buy political goodwill. Asma Khalid, NPR News.

            "article_content": "A likely contested convention has Republicans hunting for delegates everywhere, including some of the most democratic Congressional districts in America.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: The expectation that this summer's Republican National Convention will be contested has all of the candidates hunting for delegates anywhere they can find them. NPR's Scott Detrow reports on that search from one of the deepest blue Democratic pockets of the country, the Bronx. SCOTT DETROW, BYLINE: There are a lot of things in the Bronx - a zoo, a baseball stadium, 1.4 million people. There's one thing that's pretty rare though - Republican voters. BRUCE BERG: They're nonexistent. DETROW: Bruce Berg is a political scientist at Fordham University in the Bronx. BERG: If I was going to give you a flippant response, I would say we can probably name them. DETROW: In the one congressional district entirely in the Bronx, Democrats outnumber Republicans by a 19 to 1 margin. In the 2012 presidential primary, less than 300 Republicans voted in that district. But Bronx Republicans - they do exist. MICHAEL RENDINO: Michael Rendino, the vice-chairman of the Bronx Republican Party and part owner of Stan's Sports Bar, the legendary bar in the shadows of Yankee Stadium. DETROW: This week, Rendino is very, very popular. RENDINO: Inundated with phone calls, emails, contacts on Facebooks from the strangest, most random people such as yourself - not that you're strange and random. DETROW: That's because New York distributes most of its 95 delegates by congressional district. Each district has three to give out, even heavily Democratic districts like the ones in the Bronx. That means the small handful of Republicans who vote here next week will kind of be super voters. RENDINO: Figure we have seven delegates for this borough for 10,000 or less votes. DETROW: For presidential campaigns, that means swinging a couple dozen voters one way or another could lead to one or two extra delegates, and that could be the difference between a clinch nomination and a floor fight. That's why Trump's campaign manager is calling Rendino and why both Cruz and Kasich were making campaign stops in the Bronx. Most Bronx Republicans appear to be leaning Trump. As the subway rumbles over the sports bar, Rendino says he appreciates Trump's focus on blue-collar issues he thinks the party has ignored. RENDINO: It's all been about the special interests, the big corporations and the social right-wing social conservatives, more about religion and gay marriage - things that aren't as big an issue to people who're living in an urban area like us. DETROW: At a meeting of the Bronx Republican Party, Linda Schiffren was one of the few attendees backing Cruz, and she was kind of sheepish about it. LINDA SCHIFFREN: I'm a hundred percent committed, but I do think he could use a speech coach and some better suits. DETROW: Schiffren lives in Riverdale, a high-income pocket of the Northwest Bronx. She isn't too comfortable with the borough's super voter status. SCHIFFREN: Look, normal, middle-class Republicans find it kind of funny and also kind of irritating that people who live in the least Republican district in the United States of America have more influence. DETROW: But that's a dynamic Schiffren and other Republicans will have to get used to. There's no way Trump can clinch a majority of delegates until June 7, the very last day of the primary calendar. That's when California awards 172 delegates, mostly on a district by district basis. So whether or not Republicans head to a contested convention could come down to the handful of Republican voters in deep blue places like Berkeley, Los Angeles and San Francisco.

This was supposed to be a quiet week for Mike Rendino. He manages Stan's, the bar across the street from Yankee Stadium, and the Yankees are in Toronto. Instead, it's been bedlam. Rendino said he's \"been inundated with phone calls, emails, contacts on Facebook from the strangers, most random people. The New York Times, the Washington Post.\" That's because Rendino is also the vice chair of the Bronx Republican Party. And with Ted Cruz and Donald Trump scrapping for every delegate ahead of an expected contested Republican National Convention, Bronx Republicans are suddenly very popular people. I tell people I'm the vice chair, and they're like, 'Yeah, but it's The Bronx.' \" Mike Rendino, vice chairman of The Bronx GOP Normally, Rendino said, \"I tell people I'm the vice chair, and they're like, 'Yeah, but it's The Bronx. So there aren't that many Republicans.'\" This week, however, \"Trump's campaign is all over us. I talked to [campaign manager] Cory Lewandowski yesterday,\" said Rendino as the 4 train rumbled over the bar. Cruz held his first campaign event after the Wisconsin primary in the Bronx, and John Kasich showed up one day later to dig into Italian food on Arthur Ave. New York State divides up the bulk of its 95 convention delegates by congressional district. Each one awards three \u2014 even heavily, heavily Democratic districts like the Bronx-based 15th, where Democrats outnumber Republican 19-to-1. Only 1,682 Republicans voted borough-wide in the 2012 presidential primary. In the one district comprised solely of Bronx voters \u2014 the other two bleed into neighboring counties and boroughs \u2014 just 285 Republicans cast ballots last time. \"I figure there are seven delegates in this borough for 10,000 voters or less,\" Rendino said.

April 6. Which means Bronx Republicans are essentially super-voters. Swing a couple dozen one way or another, and a candidate could pick up an extra two or three delegates. With Trump's path to the 1,237 delegates needed to avoid a floor fight offering little room for error, those three delegates could be the difference between a clinched nomination and a messy floor fight. (And 81 of New York's 95 delegates on the GOP side are allocated this way, three from each of the state's 27 congressional districts.) While it may seem almost farcical for Cruz, Kasich, and Trump to troll for votes in one of America's most deep-blue counties, it's a situation that will play itself out again at the end of the primary calendar. California awards nearly all of its 172 delegates in the same fashion. That means Republicans in places like Berkeley, San Francisco and Los Angeles will play the role of super voters when the primary is racing to the finish line. \"Well look, normal, middle-class Republicans find it kind of funny \u2014 and also kind of irritating \u2014 that people who live in the least-Republican district in the United States of America have more influence than those of us who are actually real Republicans,\" said Lisa Schiffren, who lives in Riverdale, a higher-income pocket of the northwest Bronx. Waiting for a meeting of the Bronx Republican Party to get underway, Schiffren said she's backing Cruz. \"I know that's not a popular choice in New York,\" she said. \"I'm 100 percent committed, but I do think he could use a speech coach \u2014 and some better suits.\" Schriffren said she admires Cruz's approach to constitutionalism, but could do with a little less evangelicalism on the campaign trail. \"I'm happy they're solid Christians,\" she said, \"But, eh, maybe we don't' need to hear so much about it.\" Nearly everyone else at the party meeting was backing Trump, and everyone expects the New York native to do very well here on Tuesday.

More about religion and gay marriage \u2014 things that aren't as big an issue to people living in urban areas like us.\" He added, \"Most of us are Roman Catholic, but we kind of have that separation of church and state.\" Rendino said he and Lewandowski had discussed the possibility of Trump making a surprise campaign stop in The Bronx ahead of Tuesday's primary. One possible location: the borough's Trump Golf Links at Ferry Point, which many Bronx Republicans mentioned as an example of Trump's business success. \"I grew up 10 minutes away from it,\" Rendino said, \"and I watched for 35 years of my life be a toxic dump until Donald got involved and made it a success.\" New York City paid for the vast majority of construction costs. Cruz further hurt his chances with Bronx GOP loyalists by keeping them out of the loop on last week's Bronx campaign stop, where he appeared alongside a Democratic state senator. \"We're all annoyed,\" said Fred Brown, who chairs the National Black Republican Congress. Regardless of Tuesday's outcome, Bronx Republicans are reveling in their relevance. \"Just having three Republican candidates coming to The Bronx is amazing,\" Rendino told the meeting of about 20 party activists. \"This is a high point for us.\" He continued, \"It actually means something for us. You need to tell people that. You need to tell your neighbors that.\"",

It has been a turbulent week for Mexico's diplomats in the U.S. The reason for the shakeup can be summed up in two words: Donald Trump. This week, the Republican presidential front-runner released details of one of his oft-repeated campaign promises \u2014 to make Mexico pay for construction of a border wall. The plan, which involves blocking billions of dollars that Mexicans working in the U.S. send back home, seemed to shake up Mexico's top officials and cause a break in their months of relative silence about Trump's anti-Mexican comments. With swift aim, Mexico gave its ambassador in Washington the boot, replacing him with a career diplomat. And a key operative known for his public relations acumen took over one of the highest profile jobs in Mexico's Foreign Ministry. What is in Trump's plan? Trump says as president, he would block the estimated $24 billion in remittances that Mexicans in the U.S. send back home until Mexico pays $5 billion to $10 billion for the construction costs of the wall. Once the money is deposited, he says he would allow the flow of remittances to resume to Mexico again. In his campaign memo outlining the plan, Trump writes, \"It's an easy decision for Mexico. Make a one-time payment of $5 - $10 billion to ensure that $24 billion continues to flow into their country year after year.\" Why did Mexico pull its ambassador from Washington? Mexico's Foreign Minister Claudia Ruiz Massieu told Mexico's El Universal newspaper Tuesday that there has been an \"exacerbated mood\" against Mexicans in the U.S. She said there is fear \"that this spirit can grow and overflow and may generate hostilities.\" The same day, Ruiz announced the shake-up in Mexico's U.S. diplomatic staff, presumably to encourage a more aggressive response to counter perceived anti-Mexican sentiment in the U.S. after Trump's rhetoric.

His plan to block billions in remittances seemed to shake up Mexico's top officials and cause a break in their relative silence about Trump's anti-Mexican comments. Out is current Ambassador Miguel Basa\u00f1ez Ebergenyi, who had held the top diplomatic post only since September. Basa\u00f1ez, an academic who taught at Tufts University, had taken a quiet approach to Trump's comments \u2014 even predicting that the Republican front-runner would soon apologize for making disparaging remarks about Mexicans. Like most Mexican officials until now, Basa\u00f1ez has often said he didn't want to dignify Trump's increasingly hostile comments with a response and wanted to stay out of the domestic U.S. political fray. In as new ambassador is Carlos Manuel Sada Solana, a career diplomat who is accustomed to posts in North America. He's currently consul general in Los Angeles and previously held the same job in New York, Chicago, San Antonio and Toronto. Meanwhile, Paulo Carre\u00f1o will move from the president's communication's staff to become head of North American affairs in the Foreign Ministry. Tasked with improving Mexico's image abroad, Carre\u00f1o is well-versed in public relations and is not shy at confronting reporters, especially from the foreign press, when he feels Mexico is not portrayed in a positive light. What is Mexico hoping its new crop of diplomats will achieve? Mexico wants to protect its image and hit back harder than in the past, and the government appears to be letting the Foreign Ministry take charge of this effort. Mexico will use its 50 U.S. consulates and its embassy to promote the country and the role of Mexicans in America. It is also offering free citizenship workshops at many of those consulates, to help Mexican immigrants become U.S. citizens \u2014 and voters.",

The first few minutes of the Democratic debate on CNN between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders were quite cordial. But that didn't last long. Taking place in Flint, Mich., the town that has been thrust into the national spotlight amid its water crisis, the two candidates took questions from the audience about their plans to help the heavily African-American city recover and restore clean water to all its residents. But as the debate wore on, the two rivals had one of their testiest exchanges yet as discussion moved to trade policies, the auto bailout, Michigan's struggling economy and gun control. Michigan is an important political test for both Democratic candidates. Its 147 pledged delegates will be up for grabs on Tuesday, where polls show it's the former secretary of state who has an edge over the Vermont senator. Here are some of the top moments. Focus on Flint water crisis Both candidates used their opening statements to address the devastating water crisis in Flint. Sanders reiterated his earlier call for Republican Gov. Rick Snyder to resign over the scandal, saying \"his dereliction of duty was irresponsible.\" \"Amen,\" Clinton echoed, calling for the first time as well for Snyder to step down or to face a recall election. \"We must focus on what should be done for people of Flint,\" Clinton said, reminding the audience it was her idea to hold a debate in Flint. \"It is raining lead in Flint, and the state is derelict in not coming forward with the money that is required.\" Sanders told one woman from the audience, who were questioning the candidates, that it was a disgrace that his water bill in Vermont was lower than ones in Flint right now. \"The first thing you do is say people are not paying a water bill for poisoned water,\" Sanders thundered. Both were pressed on whether they had waited too late to visit the embattled community and whether they were only pushing the issue for political gain and would abandon the fight after the election. \"When I heard about it, I immediately sent people here to find out what was going on. It was almost unbelievable,\" Clinton said. She pledged that as president she would rid the country of lead pipes everywhere within five years to prevent another Flint-like crisis and would stay with the city \"in whatever capacity I am.\" Sanders dings Clinton on trade: She's \"found religion\" Questions from Flint residents moved on to how to protect jobs in the state, especially the state's troubled auto industry. Clinton explained how she would incentivize manufacturing. But Sanders pounced, calling her out on having an inauthentic change of heart on one of his most passionate issues. \"I am very glad that Secretary Clinton discovered religion on this issue, but it's a little bit too late,\" he argued. \"Secretary Clinton supported virtually every one of the disastrous trade agreements written by corporate America.\" He slammed her for past support of trade agreements like the North American Free Trade Agreement, which was implemented under President Bill Clinton, and for being late in opposing the more recent Trans-Pacific Partnership. But Clinton turned the tables, arguing that Sanders opposed the auto bailout that helped to salvage many jobs in the state. \"The money was there, and had to be released in order to save the American auto industry and 4 million jobs, and to begin the restructuring. We had the best year that the auto industry has had in a long time. I voted to save the auto industry,\" Clinton said. Sanders underscored his passion for the issue, though, embracing a frequent criticism that he's too focused on inequality during his campaign. \"I'm a one-issue person, well, I guess so,\" he said. \"My one issue is trying to rebuild a disappearing middle class. That's my one issue.\" The two also disagreed on whether the Export-Import Bank should be renewed \u2014 something conservatives oppose and that Sanders has been a lone voice of Democratic opposition on. He argued that the bank benefits big corporations, such as Boeing and Caterpillar, while Clinton argued it's necessary to protect American jobs and keep them in the U.S. Things get testy: \"Excuse me, I'm talking\" The trade issue prompted one of the most tense exchanges between the two candidates. As Sanders tried to rebut Clinton's claims, he interjected, \"Excuse me, I'm talking.\" \"When billionaires on Wall Street destroyed this economy, they went to Congress and they said, 'Please, we'll be good boys, bail us out,' \" Sanders continued. \"You know what I said? I said, 'Let the billionaires themselves bail out Wall Street.' It shouldn't be the middle class of this country.\" Clinton tried to interject, but he again cut her off, telling her, \"Wait a minute. Wait. Could I finish? You'll have your turn, all right?\" Later, when the conversation turned to gun control, he again jumped in: \"Can I \u2014 can I finish, please? All right?\" The succession of exchanges recalled Clinton's first campaign for office in 2000, when Republican Rep. Rick Lazio was criticized for going after Clinton during their New York Senate debate in a way some saw as sexist. That's a comparison the pro-Clinton group Correct the Record was happy to make, blasting out the clip and calling it Sanders' \"Rick Lazio moment.\" Historically, male politicians have had to walk a fine line in coming across as too aggressive against female politicians \u2014 and if Clinton is the nominee, it's an issue Republicans will have to find a way to handle as well. While this hasn't been a big problem for Sanders before, it was clear Clinton was getting under his skin on issues he's very passionate about. And it's a moment you can expect to see again, more than likely. Wall Street speeches dog Clinton One thing Clinton still hasn't found a good answer to is why she won't release transcripts of speeches she was paid to give to Wall Street groups. And as talk turned to bailouts, Sanders saw another opening to hammer her on it. \"Now, I kind of think if you get paid a couple hundred-thousand dollars for a speech, it must be a great speech. I think we should release it and let the American people see what that transcript was,\" he said. \"And I have said and I will say again, I will be happy to release anything I have as long as everybody else does too, because what really is behind that question, Republicans and Democrats, is where I can stand up to Wall Street,\" she argued, putting the onus on potential GOP rivals to release full records as well. But for Sanders, the comeback was easy. \"All right, look, Secretary Clinton wants everybody else to release it, well, I'm your Democratic opponent, I release it, here it is,\" he said, throwing his hands up in exasperation. \"There ain't nothing. I don't give speeches to Wall Street for hundreds of thousands of dollars. You got it.\" Gun control trips up Sanders If Clinton's Wall Street ties are her Achilles' heel, then Sanders' past opposition to some gun control measures is his. The father of a girl who was shot in Kalamazoo, Mich., by an Uber driver last month pressed the candidates on stricter gun control measures, noting the alleged shooter had no criminal or mental health background that would have prevented him from getting a gun. \"We've got to have a public discussion, because we have created a culture in which people grab for guns all the time,\" Clinton said, criticizing Sanders for a past vote for immunity from lawsuits for gun sellers. Sanders argued there was no \"magic solution to this problem.\" \"Any lunatic tomorrow, any person can walk into a theater and do something horrific. And you know what? For us to tell you that that absolutely will not happen would be untrue,\" he said. Pressed on the immunity vote by moderator Anderson Cooper, Sanders was forced into a full-throated defense of it \u2014 not something that usually plays well in a Democratic primary. \"If you go to a gun store and you legally purchase a gun, and then, three days later, if you go out and start killing people, is the point of this lawsuit to hold the gun shop owner or the manufacturer of that gun liable?\" Sanders argued. \"If that is the point, I have to tell you, I disagree. I disagree because you hold people \u2014 in terms of this liability thing, where you hold manufacturers' liability, is if they understand that they're selling guns into an area that it's getting into the hands of criminals, of course they should be held liable.\" Clinton went for the emotional heartstrings in her response, though. \"I want people in this audience to think about what it must feel like to send off your first-grader, little backpack, maybe, on his or her back, and then the next thing you hear is that somebody has come to that school using an automatic weapon, an AR-15, and murdered those children,\" she said. \"Now, they are trying to prevent that from happening to any other family.\"",

Sanders promotes the idea of free college education for all.\n                \n                    \n                    Evan Vucci/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders speaks during a town hall at the University of South Carolina. Sanders promotes the idea of free college education for all. Since he first announced his presidential campaign, Bernie Sanders has stuck to one simple promise. One that has many young people, in particular, #feelingthebern: free college. As Sanders put it in his New Hampshire victory speech: \"When we need the best-educated workforce in the world, yes, we are going to make public colleges and universities tuition-free.\" The Pitch There's a reason this promise has such powerful appeal. Earning some sort of postsecondary degree or certificate is more and more considered a necessity if you want to earn a middle-class living. Meanwhile, on a percentage basis, by some measures, college tuition has increased in cost more than any other good or service in the U.S. economy since 1978. It rises at two or three times the rate of inflation every single year. And student loans have grown in tandem, to a total of $1.2 trillion. There's rising concern that this debt is stopping young people from buying homes, starting families or businesses, saving for their futures and generally being launched into their lives. The Critics As with many other elements of his platform, critics of Sanders' free-college proposal have charged that it is unrealistic and that he hasn't fully explained how to pay for it. Funding free college can be tricky because, as with other government benefits, the very act of promising to pay can drive up costs in a couple of different ways. Andrew Kelly, a prominent critic of the idea at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, has written that capping tuition at zero \"limits college spending to whatever the public is willing to invest. But it does not change the cost of college, or what institutions actually spend per student. If the past is any guide, that cost will continue to grow, and an influx of federal money may lead profligate administrators to spend even more. Enrollments will also increase, further multiplying the cost of free college.\" The Short Answer But let's assume that, somehow, it gets done. Would getting rid of tuition at public colleges and universities, by itself, really give the United States \"the most educated workforce in the world\"? Probably not. Let's look around the world and find out why. The Long Answer The United States currently has the ninth-most-educated workforce in the world, with 45 percent of young adults having earned some form of diploma or certificate. That's according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which compiles detailed statistics on developed countries. The U.S. is above the OECD average, making modest progress over the past decade, even as tuition has risen steadily. \"The most educated workforces in the world,\" though, are smoking us. They are found in South Korea, where a whopping 67 percent of adults have some postsecondary education, and Japan and Canada (both at 58 percent). Now, here's the problem with Sanders' claim that free tuition is necessary: All three countries charge tuition at their universities, which are overwhelmingly public. The numbers are roughly on par with in-state tuition at many public universities here. In fact, Canada's recent graduates have student loan burdens similar to those of U.S. students, and they're not happy about it. So whatever the differences in education systems, policy, culture and demographics among these three countries and the United States, it's clear, at least on the face of it, that free tuition is not required to produce \"the most educated workforce in the world.\" The Other Side Now, let's look at the question a different way. As Sanders points out on his website, Germany recently abolished college tuition, and \"Finland, Norway, Sweden and many other countries around the world also offer free college to all of their citizens.\" This is true. But again, there's a catch: Only one of these free-college countries does better than the United States when it comes to educational attainment. Germany and Finland are both below the OECD average (Germany is a bit of a special case because of its extensive training and apprenticeship system, which tracks students as early as high school). Sweden's rate is almost identical to that of the United States. Norway is just a tick higher: 47 percent. And two more free-college countries, Brazil and Slovenia, are below the average too. So \"the most educated workforces in the world\" today don't have free college. And countries that do have free public universities don't necessarily have more educated workforces than we do. Is it an open-and-shut fact-check case? Maybe not. Andreas Schleicher, a top education analyst at the OECD, had some final thoughts for NPR Ed. \"It is not possible to establish meaningful relationships between the cost of higher education and attainment, as there are too many intervening variables,\" he said. (Translation: This armchair exercise is a bit futile.) \"However, it is clear that growth in attainment in the U.S. has been particularly low and cost is likely an impediment to this. Many European countries provide free public higher education and in virtually all of these countries taxpayers benefit from this (in the sense that the additional tax revenues paid by better educated workers far outweigh the public expenditure on higher education).\" In other words, we probably could get some more people through college by footing the bill. Not only that, it would probably pay for itself. Schleicher also suggests that there's a cheaper way to get the same benefits: by expanding our current Pell Grant program and student loan repayment options, similar to steps the U.K. has taken. Sanders has some ideas on that too, of course.",

Now it's time for Wall Street to return the favor. Sanders has proposed something he calls a speculation tax, a small levy on every stock, bond or derivative sold in the United States. The revenue would go toward free tuition at public colleges and universities and would also be used to pare down student debt and pay for work-study programs, as well as other programs, Sanders says. While Hillary Clinton has proposed a similar tax on high-speed trading, Sanders' plan would go much further. Both candidates say their tax would cut back on computer-generated, high-speed trading, which is often accused of destabilizing the markets and giving an unfair advantage to large firms. \"These high-frequency traders ... make enormous amounts of money, billions and billions of dollars, and do nothing of any social value for the economy,\" said Len Burman, co-director of the Tax Policy Center, a joint project of the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution. \"They're just kind of the modern-day equivalent of skimming pennies out of the till.\" The idea of a tax on financial transactions is anything but new. Over the years, versions of it have been proposed by economists John Maynard Keynes and James Tobin. The United States actually had such a tax until 1966, as do numerous countries today. The European Union is expected to impose one as soon as next year. Under the Sanders proposal, trades would be taxed at a rate of 0.5 percent for stocks and 0.1 percent for bonds. A stock trade of $1,000 would thus incur a cost of $5. Burman believes the tax \"would have mixed effects.\" \"On the one hand, it will raise the cost of investment,\" he said. \"It's going to be a little bit more costly to get capital to businesses and others who have got useful things they want to do with it, and that's a cost to the economy. \"On the other hand, to the extent that it discourages unproductive trading ... that's a good thing for the economy.\" Given the huge size of the financial markets and the enormous volumes of trading that take place today, such a tax could also raise a lot of revenue, although estimates of exactly how much vary widely. Robert Pollin, co-director of the Political Economy Research Institute at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, who has studied the issue for years, said the Sanders proposal mirrors a tax proposed by Democratic U.S. Rep. Keith Ellison of Minnesota in a bill called the \"Inclusive Prosperity Act.\" Pollin believes such a tax could raise as much as $340 billion a year over the next decade. But the Tax Policy Center said the potential revenue would be less than one-tenth of that. One reason for the big disparity between the estimates is that no one really knows how Wall Street firms would respond if such a tax was imposed. John Cochrane, senior fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University, said many firms would find ways to get around the tax, by routing transactions through overseas markets, or trading options instead of stocks, for instance. \"It'll induce some very clever financial innovation of how to get around it,\" Cochrane said, \"because there's ways to trade without incurring the tax, and, as a result, I don't think it'll gain much revenue.\" \"The cleverness of our financial engineers shouldn't be underestimated,\" he added. Although the tax would be imposed on big banks and other large financial institutions, at least some of the pain would end up getting passed on to small investors, through higher costs to pension and insurance funds that invest in Wall Street, Burman said. But Warren Gunnels, policy director for the Sanders campaign, argued that if Wall Street firms pass on the cost to investors, tax credits would be available to help low- and moderate-income people defray the cost.",

They met at Sylvia's, the Harlem soul food restaurant that's held a special place in African-American politics for decades.  KELLY MCEVERS, HOST: African-American voters are a big part of the Democratic Party, but they did not play a big role in either the Iowa or New Hampshire primary contests. That is about to change in future primaries. Today, candidate Bernie Sanders visited Reverend Al Sharpton in New York, as NPR's Joel Rose reports. JOEL ROSE, BYLINE: The morning after his first primary victory, Bernie Sanders made a pilgrimage to Sylvia's, a soul food restaurant that's been a fixture of Harlem politics for decades. UNIDENTIFIED CROWD: (Chanting) Feel the Bern'. Feel the Bern'. Feel the Bern'. ROSE: Screaming fans, including fourth-graders from a local charter school, greeted Sanders as he shook hands with Sharpton on the sidewalk. Sanders smiled and waved in his rumpled black overcoat. Then they met privately for about 20 minutes. Afterwards, Sharpton offer no endorsement, but he did praise Sanders for showing up. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) AL SHARPTON: In January of next year, for the first time in American history, a black family will be moving out of the White House. I do not want black concerns to be moved out with them. And Senator Sanders coming here this morning further makes it clear that we will not be ignored. Our votes must be earned. ROSE: Sanders didn't take any questions from reporters, but he sent a clear signal that he wants to improve his standing with African-American voters. Sanders' rival for the Democratic nomination needs no introduction in Harlem. Hillary Clinton represented New York in the Senate, and her husband's foundation had its headquarters in the neighborhood for a decade. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BILL PERKINS: There is an impression that this is Clinton land, and it's not. ROSE: Bill Perkins represents Harlem in the State Senate, and he's endorsing Sanders. Perkins thinks the Vermont senator has more support with African-American voters than polls suggest, voters like Janine Buckley (ph) of Manhattan. JANINE BUCKLEY: I love Bern'. I love him. He's talking about the working people and people who doesn't have money and the people struggling and the young people that are growing up. ROSE: But Clinton still has her share of support here, too. SYLVIA RICHARDSON: Hillary is going to take it. Trust me. She's going to take it. ROSE: Sylvia Richardson (ph) was born and raised in Harlem. RICHARDSON: There's no longer middle-class. There's poor, and there's rich. And she understand that in order for us to have equality, things have to change.

This story was originally posted on the website of member station NHPR: If you want to know whether Hillary Clinton will stay close to Bernie Sanders in New Hampshire on Tuesday or are looking for an early hint of how the Republican race will end up, here's a tip: Keep an eye on Rochester. This blue-collar city, evenly split between Republicans and Democrats, has picked the winners in each party's presidential primary since 1972 \u2014 with one exception: the 1992 Democratic race, when it chose Bill Clinton (who lost the primary to Paul Tsongas). But there are places other than Rochester to watch, if you want an early read on the statewide results. When polling places close Tuesday night, you can cut through many of the incoming numbers and focus on just a handful of towns whose voting histories provide a lens through which to read this year's results. The maps below guide you through those towns, providing a cheat sheet of sorts for primary night. Towns Democrats Are Watching The main categories of key communities in the Democratic race are: Hover over a colored-in city or town on each map for details on that community's electorate and why the results there matter. These places all played critical roles in determining the outcome of the 2008 Democratic primary between Clinton and Barack Obama. Also, each represents a different segment of the Democratic electorate: young voters, middle-class voters and educated professionals. There's also Manchester, which provided the foundation of Clinton's 2008 primary victory. A strong performance by either candidate here could wipe out advantages across much larger geographic areas by his or her opponent. Towns Republicans Are Watching Republican primaries in New Hampshire are won or lost in just a handful of regions: there's the city of Manchester, which no presidential primary winner has failed to capture in more than 40 years. There's also the chunk of suburban towns between Manchester and the Massachusetts border, rich with Republican voters. But Manchester and its suburbs have very different voting patterns when it comes to GOP politics. And much like in the Democratic race, the state's old mill cities may also play a crucial role in this year's GOP race. As we said earlier, don't take your eye off Rochester if you're eager for an early read on the state of the race.",

            "article_content": "Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders meet for a debate Thursday night in New Hampshire. It comes just days after the two were paired in the closest contest in Iowa caucus history.  KELLY MCEVERS, HOST: Less than 24 hours after the appeared together in a town hall on CNN, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders will be on stage tonight for a TV debate on MSNBC. That happens in Durham, N.H. The two Democrats face very different challenges in the vote in New Hampshire next week, and joining us from Manchester to talk about those challenges is NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson. So tell us, Mara. What are the stakes in the Democratic race on Tuesday? I mean, for a long time, Sanders has been ahead in this state. I mean, doesn't he have it all wrapped up? MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Well, he does have a huge lead - 20 points in the latest NBC poll. Sanders really needs a big win here. He needs to win the way he's polling, given how the next couple of contests are going to be in much less friendly electorates for him in Nevada and South Carolina. The stakes, however, are much higher for Hillary Clinton. Her campaign is not saying her goal is to win here, but she simply needs to narrow Sanders' margin as much as possible. She's already trying to kind of pre-spin his victory by saying he's a neighbor; he's from Vermont. But a big loss here would really be stinging for her. And you know, New Hampshire has been very, very good to both Clintons in the past, and Hillary Clinton has been trying to drum up some of that old good will again this week. MCEVERS: What are you watching for in the debate tonight? LIASSON: Well, for Hillary Clinton, I'm watching to see how she uses the debate to address the deficits that her battle with Sanders has exposed. She seems to not be able to appeal to young people. She lost them 9 to 1 in Iowa. She will be on a college campus tonight. Also, she hasn't been able to give a good answer about her ties to Wall Street, her paid speeches to investment banks. And also, I'm watching to see how she connects her critique of Sanders as a pie-in-the-sky idealist as opposed to her, pragmatic progressive who can get things done. How does she connect that to a bigger, more aspirational message about the middle class and the future? MCEVERS: What are you look for from Sanders? LIASSON: Well, Sanders has been relatively restrained. He has attacked her for her ties to Wall Street, for being establishment, not being a pure-enough progressive. He hasn't made an issue of her emails or the Foundation. He hasn't connected that to her character or her trustworthiness. He doesn't seem to want to be a left-wing Pat Buchanan, who really did undermine the first George Bush's efforts to win the White House, to win a second term in 1992. You know, what is, to me, the most interesting thing about this Democratic battle - it was supposed to be something that would toughen up Hillary Clinton - having a sparring partner, not having a coronation. That was supposed to make her a better general election candidate. Instead, she's getting roughed up rather than toughened up, and Democrats are really worrying. MCEVERS: Do you think there's a chance that Bernie Sanders could overplay his advantage in New Hampshire? I mean, does he need to be thinking ahead about audiences in places like South Carolina and other primary states? LIASSON: Well, yes, and I think that's why he's being relatively restrained. I don't think that the Democratic Party wants to see a battle - a personal battle or a battle over character. They want to keep it on issues. MCEVERS: You mentioned this is on a college campus. I mean, that's not the most typical community in any state. There's also been a lot of talk about New Hampshire overall being less than a perfect reflection of the U.S. as a whole. Are we hearing that again this week? LIASSON: We certainly are. New Hampshire, like Iowa, is much whiter, more rural and more prosperous than a lot of the rest of the country. But for people who feel that New Hampshire and Iowa are unworthy first-line vetters (ph), just hold on because in a week or two, the candidates are headed to South Carolina and Nevada where there are a lot more African-American voters, Hispanic voters, union members. The electorate is a lot more like the general population. MCEVERS: That's NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson. Thanks so much. Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Harry Rubenstein is deep in a thought about a log cabin when he pauses, mid-sentence, and disappears down a corridor. He returns a moment later brandishing a large wooden ax. Rubenstein is the chair of the political history division at the Smithsonian Museum of American History, and he's standing in a room that's packed with about 100,000 items from previous presidential elections. The collection, he says, ranges \"from a little bit before the American Revolution, to probably last week.\" From his vantage point in this locked, windowless room in the Smithsonian, Rubenstein is able to draw parallels between signs, hats and other tchotchkes crafted decades \u2014 even centuries \u2014 apart. Valeska Hilbig (left), deputy director of communications and marketing at the National Museum of American History, passes along clothing that represents the spirit of campaigning in the '70s to curator Jon Grinspan.\n                \n                    \n                    Brandon Chew/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Valeska Hilbig (left), deputy director of communications and marketing at the National Museum of American History, passes along clothing that represents the spirit of campaigning in the '70s to curator Jon Grinspan. The cabin? It's from the original 1840 \"log cabin campaign\" \u2014 an attempt by William Henry Harrison's supporters to paint their candidate as a regular American with humble beginnings. \"This is really the beginning of trying to create some sort of simple identity for candidates,\" Rubenstein says. That's why he goes and grabs the ax. It's from another, more consequential election 20 years later, when the newly formed Republican Party was pushing a common-man narrative, as well. Its candidate: the \"rail-splitter,\" Abe Lincoln. \"Fear not,\" the ax reads. \"Old Abe is ours.\" \"This has become a real staple of campaigning, and you can see that being played out in contemporary campaigns today,\" Rubenstein says. Candidates may no longer grow up in log cabins or split firewood, but Republican presidential hopefuls like Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz talk up their parents' immigrant roots, and Hillary Clinton reminds voters of the struggles her mother went through growing up in a neglected household. Today's Tchotchkes, Tomorrow's Exhibits That continuity is why Rubenstein is preparing to send a team of curators to Iowa and New Hampshire over the next couple of weeks. They'll scour the early primary and caucus states for artifacts that help tell the story of the 2016 campaign to future generations, and then bring them back to the museum. This year's memorabilia will join an impressive collection. On a table in the room, there are jacket buttons commemorating George Washington's inauguration. A cast-iron elephant featuring a picture of William Howard Taft. From more recent campaigns, there are John Kerry flip-flops Republicans used to taunt the 2004 Democratic nominee, as well as \"Deanie Babies\" boosting Howard Dean. Rubenstein talks about memorabilia from different presidential campaigns.\n                \n                    \n                    Brandon Chew/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Rubenstein talks about memorabilia from different presidential campaigns. That's right. Today's \"Make America Great Again\" hat could be tomorrow's rail-splitter ax. Curators Lisa-Kathleen Graddy and Jon Grinspan will visit campaign headquarters and attend rallies. Later this year, they'll hunt for artifacts at party conventions. \"We know that we're going to try and get the standard materials that each campaign is putting out,\" Graddy says. \"The signs, posters, the bumper strickers, the buttons.\" We're the most brazen people on earth...'I love that shirt you're wearing....I don't suppose you'd want to give it to me, would you?' Lisa-Kathleen Graddy, Smithsonian curator They'll also be looking for homemade items that supporters bring with them. \"We're the most brazen people on earth,\" says Graddy. \"Hi, I'm Lisa-Kathleen. I'm with the Smithsonian Institution. I love that shirt you're wearing. Can you tell me why you have it? I don't suppose you'd want to give it to me, would you?\" She says that on that last question, the answer is usually a no \u2014 at least right there in the moment. \"If it's something that's meaningful to you right now, you might not want to give it to us right in the moment. Because one, you're still using it. I'm still at this rally. I still have this sign. I still have my shirt on.\" \"We distribute a lot of business cards,\" she adds. 228 Years Of History ... And Continuity But as more and more of the political process shifts to the digital space, the Smithsonian has made a decision not to curate the images, memes and hashtags that increasingly define the campaign conversation. \"This is a debate, and I'm sure that our future curators might curse some of us of the past\" for not doing so, concedes Rubenstein. (Left) An old banner for Thomas Jefferson's campaign in 1800 has printed on it \"T. Jefferson President of the United States of America / John Adams is no more.\" (Right) For the 1972 presidential election the age to vote was lowered to 18. Clothes were used to bring in younger voters.\n                \n                    \n                    Brandon Chew/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption (Left) An old banner for Thomas Jefferson's campaign in 1800 has printed on it \"T. Jefferson President of the United States of America / John Adams is no more.\" (Right) For the 1972 presidential election the age to vote was lowered to 18. Clothes were used to bring in younger voters. But, he argues, the Smithsonian is seeing other institutions create that digital archive, \"and so we decided we would focus, in a sense, on our strength, which are strange pins and funny hats and signs of all shapes and forms.\" \"These are the things that make you know that history's real,\" says Graddy. \"It happened. We touched it. We used it. We wore it. These are the things that memories are really made of.\" And those items, all together, also tell the story of American politics. For all the changes that have happened since the country first elected a president, Rubenstein says he's struck by how much remains the same. The form itself may shift \u2014 a brass elephant from 1912 morphs into a plush George W. Bush elephant in 2000 \u2014 but, he says, the main idea remains the same. \"It gets embellished and changed but the continuity is still there.\" Rubenstein holds an old shovel that was used to clear snow away from people's front yards, then left as a campaign advertisement.\n                \n                    \n                    Brandon Chew/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Rubenstein holds an old shovel that was used to clear snow away from people's front yards, then left as a campaign advertisement. So far, 2016 has stood out as an especially angry election. I ask if there's anything in the collection that typifies the personal vitriol of some of America's early elections. Graddy smiles. \"Should we show them the banner?\" she asks. Rubenstein disappears, and comes back with a large portfolio-type folder. He clears some space and unveils a banner from Thomas Jefferson's 1801 inauguration. Jefferson's victory against incumbent President John Adams was a nail-biter that was so close it served as one of the first tests of the country's new Constitution. Jefferson supporters have drawn an image of their candidate. Next to it, an eagle holds a sign proclaiming Jefferson as the new president. Its second line, however, reads: \"John Adams is no more.\" As Graddy puts it, \"gloating is also an American tradition.\"",

NPR's campaign reporters have spent months on the trail listening to and analyzing the candidates' movements, speeches and policy. But you don't need months, because three of those reporters \u2014 Tamara Keith, Don Gonyea and Sarah McCammon \u2014 have distilled what you need to know to just 100 words and 60 seconds. Click above or read \u2014 and listen \u2014 on:  Ben Carson leaves the State House in Concord, N.H., after filing GOP primary paperwork in November.\n                \n                    \n                    Darren McCollester/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Ben Carson leaves the State House in Concord, N.H., after filing GOP primary paperwork in November. Dr. Ben Carson is a renowned pediatric neurosurgeon who performed historic surgery separating conjoined twins. Carson runs on that resume \u2014 an outsider who can pull together smart people to solve difficult problems. He rose in politics after criticizing President Obama's policies in a 2013 speech, with Obama two seats away. Carson's soft-spoken manner and Christian faith won him the admiration of many evangelicals. He rose as a prime challenger to Donald Trump in the fall and fell back when his lack of foreign policy experience became a vulnerability. Some advisers were quoted expressing concern about his mastery of the subject. \u2014 NPR's Sarah McCammon  Ted Cruz at a second amendment rally at the Granite State Indoor Range and Gun Shop in Hudson, N.H., earlier this month.\n                \n                    \n                    Darren McCollester/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Ted Cruz at a second amendment rally at the Granite State Indoor Range and Gun Shop in Hudson, N.H., earlier this month. Ted Cruz is known for fiery rhetoric in the U.S. Senate and on the campaign trail. He is famously unpopular in Washington, but that's an asset this year, helping to boost Cruz to the top of the race. The Texan, born in Canada, campaigns as an outsider taking on Washington from the inside. Cruz claimed the mantle of religious liberty, and his evangelical following has been a source of strong fundraising and ground organization \u2014 especially in Iowa. Cruz's hawkish foreign policy message often focuses on a strong rebuke of President Obama for avoiding the phrase \"radical Islamic terrorism.\" \u2014 NPR's Sarah McCammon  John Kasich speaks during a campaign stop in Concord, N.H.\n                \n                    \n                    Darren McCollester/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption John Kasich speaks during a campaign stop in Concord, N.H. Ohio Gov. John Kasich can be brusque with voters and reporters, but he's very popular at home. He has overseen Ohio's economic recovery, pledging to bring job growth nationwide with reduced regulations and taxes. Kasich was the House budget chair in the mid-1990s and talks of balancing the federal budget with Bill Clinton. An establishment Republican, he has aggressively criticized Donald Trump. Kasich frequently notes that no Republican has ever won the White House without carrying Ohio, a place where he has always won. But Kasich's expansion of Medicaid under Obamacare and support of Common Core education standards as governor are nonstarters with conservatives. \u2014 NPR's Don Gonyea  Marco Rubio is the son of Cuban immigrants and the youngest candidate. He was elected to the Senate from Florida as a Tea Party favorite in 2010. He talks about building a 21st century economy to compete with China and aggressively argues that President Obama has been weak in fighting ISIS. A favorite of establishment Republicans for his potential to compete with Hillary Clinton, Rubio often promises to repeal Obama's executive orders and enforce the nation's immigration laws. But his role in crafting a 2013 immigration bill that included a path to citizenship is unacceptable to many conservatives. \u2014 NPR's Sarah McCammon  Donald Trump at a campaign rally in Grand Rapids, Mich., in December.\n                \n                    \n                    Scott Olson/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Donald Trump at a campaign rally in Grand Rapids, Mich., in December. Billionaire businessman Donald Trump's brand includes reality TV (The Apprentice, Miss Universe) and books (The Art of the Deal). He mixes bluntness with unapologetic bravado. After toying with a run for years, he now promises to \"Make America Great Again.\" He's the best-known nonpolitician since Eisenhower to seek the GOP nomination. A surprisingly skillful campaigner who ignores political decorum, Trump's rhetoric on immigration (\"deport them all\") and terrorism (\"bomb the s*** out of\" ISIS and ban Muslims from entering the U.S.) draws fierce criticism while channeling the anger of his backers. It makes for a formidable, unpredictable candidate. \u2014 NPR's Don Gonyea  Hillary Clinton greets supporters following a town hall in Rochester, N.H.\n                \n                    \n                    Darren McCollester/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Hillary Clinton greets supporters following a town hall in Rochester, N.H. A former secretary of state, New York senator and first lady, Hillary Clinton has been a polarizing figure since she entered the national stage in 1991. Supporters praise her experience, intelligence and longtime focus on women and girls; detractors question her accomplishments and exclusive use of a private email server for official business. Also, #Benghazi. Clinton ran for president in 2008, losing to Barack Obama in the primary. She went on to join Obama's administration and was in the situation room during the operation that killed Osama bin Laden. Clinton is a policy wonk who says her campaign will focus on fighting for middle-class families. \u2014 NPR's Tamara Keith  Bernie Sanders at the King Day at the Dome earlier this month in Columbia, S.C.\n                \n                    \n                    Sean Rayford/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Bernie Sanders at the King Day at the Dome earlier this month in Columbia, S.C. Independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders says he is leading a people-powered political revolution funded with small-dollar donations. His supporters say they #feelthebern. A self-described democratic socialist, Sanders made his name over 40 years in public life with a speech penned on a yellow legal pad about income inequality, the billionaire class and health care access. As Burlington mayor from 1981 to 1989, he prided himself on keeping streets well-plowed. In the U.S. House, and later the Senate, Sanders has advocated breaking up big banks, providing Medicare for all and free public college. Critics say Sanders' agenda would be impractical and prohibitively expensive. \u2014 NPR's Tamara Keith  Jeb Bush pauses during an event at La Casa de Esperanza in Waukesha, Wis., in November.\n                \n                    \n                    Bloomberg/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Jeb Bush pauses during an event at La Casa de Esperanza in Waukesha, Wis., in November. Jeb Bush would be the third member of his family to become president. That helps with organization and fundraising, but can be a burden given George W. Bush's legacy in Iraq and the 2008 economic crisis. It all makes him the classic \"establishment Republican\" just as \"outsiders\" are suddenly surging. Bush stresses his decades in private business and two terms as Florida governor, featuring job growth, tax cuts and education reforms. He highlights his conservative record as a governor who could get things done, but Bush's support for immigration reform and Common Core education standards is loathed by conservative activists. \u2014 NPR's Don Gonyea  Chris Christie speaks at a town hall meeting at the Loudon Fire Department in Loudon, N.H., last November.\n                \n                    \n                    Darren McCollester/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Chris Christie speaks at a town hall meeting at the Loudon Fire Department in Loudon, N.H., last November.

He took on teachers unions and starred in YouTube videos of his combative town halls. An in-your-face success story was beset by scandal. Traffic lanes on a bridge into New York were closed in an apparent act of retaliation against a local mayor. Christie wasn't implicated, but his presidential cachet was tarnished. Christie promises to provide strong, decisive leadership that he says President Obama lacks. A contender in New Hampshire, Christie is seen by many conservatives as too moderate. \u2014 NPR's Don Gonyea  Carly Fiorina at a barbecue in Wilton, Iowa, last November.\n                \n                    \n                    Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Carly Fiorina at a barbecue in Wilton, Iowa, last November.

Fiorina is running as an experienced business leader who will take on Washington from the outside. She presents herself as hawkish on foreign policy and talks about meeting many world leaders during her time in the business world.

            "article_content": "House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., speaks to the media during a briefing on Capitol Hill in September.\n                \n                    \n                    Mark Wilson/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., speaks to the media during a briefing on Capitol Hill in September. President-elect Donald Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan agree that repealing the Affordable Care Act and replacing it with some other health insurance system is a top priority.  But they disagree on whether overhauling Medicare should be part of that plan. Medicare is the government-run health system for people age 65 and older and the disabled.  Trump said little about Medicare during his campaign, other than to promise that he wouldn't cut it. Ryan, on the other hand, has Medicare in his sights. \"Because of Obamacare, Medicare is going broke,\" Ryan said in an interview on Fox News on Nov. 10. \"So you have to deal with those issues if you're going to repeal and replace Obamacare.\" In fact, the opposite appears to be true \u2014 Obamacare may actually have extended the life of Medicare.  This year's Medicare trustees report says the program would now be able to pay all its bills through 2028, a full 11 years longer than a 2009 forecast \u2014 an improvement Medicare's trustees attribute, in part, to changes in Medicare called for in the Affordable Care Act and other economic factors. And the irony of the Ryan Medicare plan, say some health policy analysts, is that it would turn the government program into something that looks very much like the structure created for insurance plans sold under the ACA. \"The way it works is comparable to Obamacare,\" says physician and conservative policy analyst Avik Roy, founder of the Foundation for Research on Equal Opportunity. Ryan's plan would set up \"Medicare exchanges\" where private insurance companies would compete with traditional government-run Medicare for customers. Obamacare exchanges sell only private insurance plans. People would get \"premium support\" from the government to pay for their insurance under the Ryan Medicare plan. The subsidy would be tied to the price of a specific plan offered by an insurer on the exchange, much like the Affordable Care Act subsidy is tied to the second-cheapest \"silver\" plans. And the payment would be linked to a recipient's income, so lower-income people would get a bigger subsidy. The subsidy would rise as beneficiaries get sicker, to ensure access to insurance. As with Obamacare, people who choose plans that cost more than the government subsidy would have to pay the balance. Insurers would have to agree to issue policies to any Medicare beneficiary, to \"avoid cherry-picking,\" and to ensure that \"Medicare's sickest and highest-cost beneficiaries receive coverage.\" The changes would start in 2024, when people who are now about 57 become Medicare eligible. Roy agrees with Ryan that Medicare is going broke and that a program structured in this way would save money through \"the magic of competition.\" \"If you have 10 insurers competing for that business, you're going to negotiate a better deal,\" he said. Medicare is already a dual public-private program. Most seniors today are enrolled in what's known as traditional Medicare, where the government pays for medical appointments, tests and hospital stays on a fee-for-service basis. Alongside that program is Medicare Advantage, an insurance plan provided by a private insurer that may offer seniors additional services like dental care at the same price. The government pays a fixed monthly fee to the insurer for each Medicare Advantage patient, rather than paying for every service separately, as it does in traditional Medicare. About half of Medicare's new enrollees choose Medicare Advantage plans, says Henry Aaron, a health care economist at the Brookings Institution. Aaron says Ryan's proposal aims to move almost all seniors into Medicare Advantage-style insurance by making traditional Medicare too expensive for the consumer. But, he says, there are risks to that approach. \"The real question here is whether the requisite safeguards are in place to ensure that the elderly and people with disabilities would be able to maneuver in such a system,\" he says. That's because the health care and health insurance systems are very complex. Doctors move in and out of networks, copayments can vary and plans can change. Millions of people on Medicare are also eligible for Medicaid, meaning they are poor and vulnerable, Aaron says. And at least 8 million Social Security beneficiaries have been declared financially incompetent and are assigned a representative to manage their money. \"What you've got here is a group of people who are very sick, poor, and often cognitively impaired one way or the other,\" Aaron says. \"Tossing people like that into a health care marketplace and saying, 'Here, go buy some insurance,' is a recipe for problems.\" Seniors may feel the same way. Researchers at Brown University last year found that as people get older and sicker, they tend to drop Medicare Advantage and opt for traditional Medicare. Ryan has been working on his plan to change Medicare for many years. A version of his \"premium support\" plan was included in several budget proposals he put forth when he was chairman of the House Budget Committee. The Congressional Budget Office says the proposals would reduce federal spending on Medicare. At this point it's unclear whether Trump shares Ryan's ambitions to upend the current Medicare system. Trump didn't include Medicare reform on his campaign website. But since his election, \"modernize Medicare\" has been included on the list of health care priorities on his transition site.",

            "article_content": "Following his win in Nevada, Donald Trump is looking more and more like he could be the GOP nominee in November. The Republican leadership in Congress is beginning to come to terms with what that might mean for the party.  AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: So far, Florida Senator Marco Rubio enjoys the most endorsements from members of Congress. But Republicans on Capitol Hill are coming around to the possibility that Donald Trump could be their nominee. NPR congressional reporter Susan Davis joins us now to discuss how the Republican establishment is adjusting to Trump's rise. And, Susan, we're talking about adjusting. What does that look like? SUSAN DAVIS, BYLINE: Well, you know, from the beginning of this race, the talk within the Capitol was always that Trump would eventually fall. But as the governors slowly fell out of this race and as he's come off three wins in the early states, there is this real palpable shift in the conversation on the Hill this week. The best way I can explain it is it's like the stages of grief, but Republicans are in stages of Trump. On one end of the spectrum, you have a South Carolina Republican Lindsey Graham, a senator who ran against Trump. And he's angry, and he's saying if Republicans don't stop Trump, he could break the party in two. Then I also talked to Congressmen like Adam Kinzinger. He's a Republican - a House Republican from Illinois who still believes that Marco Rubio has a chance to win. And, you know, we've also seen the first signs this week of acceptance. Donald Trump had a bit of a milestone. He got his first two congressional endorsements. The first was from Chris Collins, he's a Republican from New York, also a successful businessman, and Duncan Hunter, a Republican from California who's seen as a defense hawk. And he said, you know, Trump has the leadership skills to be president. If Donald Trump does really well on Super Tuesday, you might see more congressional endorsements coming out behind him. CORNISH: So how did the leadership say they would work with Donald Trump if he's the nominee? DAVIS: House Speaker Paul Ryan gets asked this question a lot. Most recently, he was asked this morning. This is what he had to say. PAUL RYAN: We'll cross these bridges when we get to it. But I do believe that we will be able to unify as a party. And I believe whoever our nominee's going to be, we'll be able to find a way to make a unified front work. DAVIS: But remember Ryan is on this long list of Republicans that Trump has ridiculed. He publicly blamed Paul Ryan for Mitt Romney's 2012 loss. As you remember, Paul Ryan was his running mate. Trump said it was Ryan's proposals on Medicare that cost Republicans that election. Trump disagrees with Paul Ryan on trade, on taxes, on entitlements like Medicare and Social Security. But, you know, when we pushed Ryan today, he said not all Republicans have to have the exact same ideas, and whoever the nominee is, they'll make it work. Now, Republicans in the House are working on their own policy agenda that they say they're going to roll out this fall, and that's what they're going to run on no matter who the nominee is. CORNISH: Run on, that's really the important thing, right? Election time... DAVIS: Exactly. CORNISH: What does the name Donald Trump at the top of a ticket do for Republicans in congressional races? DAVIS: So it could help Democrats. Republicans control both the House and the Senate, and the Senate has been in play. It will be in play no matter what. But the House has not been competitive for Democrats. They would need a massive wave to win the 30 seats they'd need for a takeover in the house. I talked to a top Democrat this morning that said, cautiously, Trump could be that seismic force that puts more House seats into play. What does that mean? It means that Republicans running in the swing, middle-of-the-road seats that might not always be competitive are suddenly competitive with a really volatile candidate at the top. But as of right now, Republicans are in firm control of the House, and it's not yet in question this fall. CORNISH: Susan Davis covers Congress for NPR. Susan, thanks so much. DAVIS: You bet.

A few weeks before the election, the Tri-Pro lumber mill in north Idaho shut down. It was the second mill to close in the area in six months, putting more than a hundred people out of work. While that's big economic loss for any community, it was especially tough for the tight-knit town of Orofino and its 3,000 or so residents. \"It's going to be a struggle, quite honestly,\" says Mike Reggear, the supply manager and only employee left on the Tri-Pro payroll. The mill officially closed Oct. 4, after operating on the site in one incarnation or another for nearly 60 years. The shuttered lumberyard is now eerily quiet as Reggear ties up some loose ends; the old mill, kilns and saws are ready to be hauled out. \"There were living-wage jobs [with good benefits] that have now been lost,\" Reggear says, shaking his head. Like most people in Clearwater County, where Orofino is located, Mike Reggear has spent his entire life working in the timber business. \"Clearwater County has taken a double shot to the nose,\" he says, following the closure of two mills that left more than a hundred people out of work.\n                \n                    \n                    Kirk Siegler/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Like most people in Clearwater County, where Orofino is located, Mike Reggear has spent his entire life working in the timber business. \"Clearwater County has taken a double shot to the nose,\" he says, following the closure of two mills that left more than a hundred people out of work. The story behind Tri-Pro's closure is an all-too-familiar one lately in north Idaho: Reggear says there just wasn't a steady enough supply of logs available locally to keep the sawmill running and profitable. The amount of federal land open to logging has dwindled since the 1980s, and imports from Canada are cheaper. But just like any economic story in rural America today, it's more complicated than that. And even in Idaho's deeply conservative timber country, there are mixed feelings over whether President-elect Donald Trump can do much to turn things around. Changing Times Timber towns like Orofino, situated along railroad lines and rivers, were put on the map more than a hundred years ago when it seemed like there was a limitless supply of timber in the Northwest woods. The federal government \u2014 and specifically the U.S. Forest Service, run as an extension of the U.S. Department of Agriculture \u2014 was in the business of actively promoting logging. Timber mill towns like Orofino were put on the map more than a hundred years ago when the timber supply in national forests seemed limitless. Today many federal lands are closed to logging, and unemployment rates in these towns are among the highest in Idaho.\n                \n                    \n                    Kirk Siegler/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Timber mill towns like Orofino were put on the map more than a hundred years ago when the timber supply in national forests seemed limitless. Today many federal lands are closed to logging, and unemployment rates in these towns are among the highest in Idaho. The environmental mood of the country is significantly different today. So is the economy \u2014 mechanization, for instance, has meant that fewer people are needed to log in the woods or work in the mills. At best, logging is a seasonal occupation, says Jerry Spencer, \"so you try to diversify a little bit \u2014 because you can't live on [work] eight months a year.\" One night over Coors Lights at the Ponderosa Restaurant, Spencer says he feels lucky he still can find work as an independent contractor, logging in the woods when he can. Spencer and one of his buddies had been splitting time between north Idaho and the oil fields in North Dakota and Wyoming, where they drove trucks. Then oil prices tanked. He's not too eager to talk politics, but Spencer says he's glad Donald Trump won. \"I'm Republican, almost everybody in this county's Republican,\" he says. \"It's a logging, resource-based county and that's how it is.\" Now that the election is over, Spencer says he's hopeful things can get better \u2014 \"but I'm not going to bet on it, just yet.\" The main reason for his pessimism, he says, is that even if Trump were to open up more federal land to logging, there are hardly any mills left here to handle all that wood. Still, the president-elect's talk of returning to a time when natural resources \u2014 mining, timber and oil \u2014 were king resonates here. \"Those resources is what built this country,\" Spencer says. \"You can say what you want, but it was all built off of mining, timber, oil ... the United States wasn't built off of tech companies.\" Urban-Rural Divide In the rural West, it's not unusual to hear jabs like that directed at city dwellers. But the divide seems even more pronounced since the election. Folks in Orofino are proud of their heritage as loggers and miners, but today, Clearwater County routinely has one of the highest unemployment rates in Idaho. In Orofino's quaint, small downtown, there are for-lease signs in empty store fronts. Locals will tell you they have to work two or three jobs \u2014 at the school, the Best Western, or for one of the local outfitters. Some are forced to commute 40 miles downriver to Lewiston. Still, when it comes to the latest mill closure, many of the same locals grudgingly say they saw this coming for years. \"The first thing you do is cuss and kick the ground and rant a little bit, but the second is, you pull yourself up by those bootstraps and figure, OK, where do we go from here?\" says Chris St. Germaine. In the 1980s, St. Germaine moved to Orofino to take a job with the U.S. Forest Service after ski-bumming her way across the West. Today she runs the county's one-person Office of Economic Development. St. Germaine's arrival in Orofino coincided with the time that the amount of federal lands available for logging started shrinking. The local timber economy subsisted because of logging on private lands, but even that has flat-lined. So St. Germaine and other civic leaders are pushing to diversify. Despite the mill closures, it hasn't been all doom and gloom: A rifle scope manufacturer opened recently, as did a company that makes jet boats. The hope is to draw more companies that cater to the fishing and hunting economy, and retrain mill workers. \"Clearwater County is a place where you can build it here, and test it out your back door,\" St. Germaine says. An Industry 'Strangled' But these are all long-term projects that likely won't help people like Pat Goetz, who is scrambling to find jobs right now. After working mostly as a bookkeeper in the timber industry since 1986, Goetz was laid off when Tri-Pro closed. So far the only jobs she's seeing advertised are minimum wage. Pat Goetz, 63, has worked in the timber industry since 1986. She lost her job and her health insurance when Tri-Pro abruptly shuttered in October.\n                \n                    \n                    Kirk Siegler/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Pat Goetz, 63, has worked in the timber industry since 1986. She lost her job and her health insurance when Tri-Pro abruptly shuttered in October. \"Once you take timber out of the equation in counties like Idaho County, Clearwater County, there isn't much else,\" she says. Losing her health insurance was the biggest shock. At 63, she's not yet eligible for Medicare, and she's not sure whether she can afford to go on the exchanges to buy a replacement plan. Goetz says she gets depressed watching, as she puts it, an industry being strangled to death. \"Young kids have to go somewhere else in order to make a living,\" Goetz says. \"My children had to move out.\" Like a lot of people in town, Goetz also didn't think twice about voting for Donald Trump. She's hoping he can help bring back timber towns like hers.",

            "article_content": "The number of doctors who each prescribe millions of dollars of medications annually in Medicare's drug program has soared, driven by expensive hepatitis C treatments and rising drug prices overall, federal data obtained by ProPublica show. The number of providers who topped the $5 million mark for prescriptions increased more than tenfold, from 41 in 2011 to 514 in 2015. The number of prescribers \u2014 mostly physicians but also nurse practitioners \u2014 exceeding $10 million in drug costs jumped from two to 70 over the same time period, according to the data. Most of the doctors atop the spending list prescribed Harvoni or Sovaldi, relatively new drugs that cure hepatitis C. Other providers on the list prescribed pricey drugs to treat cancer, multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis. Medicare's drug program, known as Part D, covers more than 41 million seniors and disabled people. In 2015, it accounted for $137.4 billion in drug spending, before factoring in rebates from drug companies. That was up from $121.5 billion a year earlier. \"The trends in this space are troubling and don't show any signs of abating,\" said Tim Gronniger, deputy chief of staff at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the federal agency that runs Medicare. \"It's going to be a pressure point for patients and the program for the foreseeable future.\" During the recent presidential campaign, both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump pledged to tackle the rising costs of prescription drugs. Since his election, however, President-elect Trump's transition agenda for health care hasn't featured the topic, a shift The Los Angeles Times  reported. Medicare has released top-level data on drug spending for 2015, including the number of doctors who prescribed medications worth more than $1 million. But the agency has only published data on individual doctors up to 2014. Dr. Ben Thrower, medical director of the Multiple Sclerosis Institute at the Shepherd Center in Atlanta, was near the top of the list in 2014. He prescribed medications costing $11.5 million that year, mostly for multiple sclerosis drugs. \"We get that it's very expensive,\" Thrower said. \"I think all the MS providers working in the U.S. would like to see the costs go down.\" But prices have climbed steadily in recent years for drugs used to treat the neurological condition, including medicines that have been on the market for quite a while. Most of the spending on Thrower's prescriptions \u2014 $8.5 million \u2014 was for MS drugs Tecfidera and Copaxone, which can slow progression of the neurological disease and reduce the chance of relapse. Thrower has received payments from the makers of those and other MS drugs, but said he cut ties with the companies in January of this year. \"It was kind of exciting when the first one came out,\" Thrower said. \"The problem we've seen is the cost for these drugs has just gone up and up and up.\" Thrower said he no longer prescribes Tecfidera to new patients because it can lower white blood cell counts, putting them at risk for infections. Just because a doctor prescribes costly drugs doesn't mean he or she has done anything wrong, Gronniger said. \"It's much more about drug pricing ... than it is about the behavior of any individual physician, many of whom are equally concerned about the price of these products as we are.\" Today, ProPublica is updating its Prescriber Checkup online tool, which allows you to look up your doctor and see how his or her prescribing in Medicare Part D compares to others in the same specialty and state. Our tool covers the year 2014. You can compare the percentage of each doctor's prescriptions that were for brand-name medications, the average cost per prescription and the average number of prescriptions per patient, among other things. Allyson Funk, a spokeswoman for the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, an industry trade group, said Medicare's figures leave out important context. \"It is important to note physicians' prescribing patterns are dynamic and based on individual patient needs,\" she said in a statement. \"When looking at Medicare Part D, government data on spending at the point of sale does not include the substantial rebates for brand name medicines negotiated between manufacturers and plans and therefore does not accurately reflect actual prescribing dollars or program spending.\" These rebates are confidential by law, but Medicare said this week that the average rebate for brand-name drugs in 2014 was 17.5 percent. The new data on high-spending prescribers is the latest indication of the burden of drug prices on government health programs. In the past couple years, Medicare's drug tab has surged, in large part because it picks up the vast majority of the cost of drugs once enrollees exceed a certain threshold each year. In 2015, beneficiaries over the limit, which was $4,700, spent $51.3 billion on drugs. In 2013, the figure was $27.7 billion, government data shows. (Taxpayers, through Medicare, pick up 80 percent of the cost of this so-called catastrophic benefit.) The Associated Press first reported the ballooning cost in July. Another sign could be seen in a drug dashboard released by Medicare this week. It showed that 1 percent of drugs prescribed in the Part D program accounted for more than one-third of the program's cost in 2015 (before rebates). Some drugs were incredibly expensive. The drug H.P. Acthar Gel, used to treat several conditions, such as multiple sclerosis relapses and a rare kidney disease, cost an average of $162,371 for each of its 3,104 users\u2014a higher per-user cost than any other drug in the program. That's up significantly from several years ago, when ProPublica flagged the drug's expense.

Harvoni, used by more than 75,000 people, cost an average of $92,847 per person, for a total cost of $7 billion (also before any rebates). Michael Chernew, a professor of health care policy and director of the Healthcare Markets and Regulation Lab at Harvard Medical School, said the number of high-dollar prescribers in Medicare doesn't surprise him. Given the increased cost of prescription drugs and the latest treatment advances, \"the entire distribution is shifting to the right.\" Chernew said that, in the long term, Medicare and insurance companies have to examine the total cost of caring for patients with certain diseases, taking into account drugs, hospital visits, medical tests and more. Only then can anyone tell if certain expenses, such as a pricey new drug, are justified. For now, he said, \"How do we know what's good or bad?\" Physicians say their top priority must be the patients in front of them, not the costs to the system. Dr. Bruce Bacon, a liver specialist at St. Louis University, had the highest total Part D drug costs in 2014, $22.7 million. He was a frequent prescriber of Sovaldi and Olysio, another expensive hepatitis C medication. Bacon didn't return a call for comment for this story. In a 2015 interview, he said he did not realize his prescriptions were so costly to Medicare. \"I really don't think about the cost,\" he said. \"I think about taking care of the patients. Should I not take care of the patients because the cost is expensive?\" Thrower, the multiple sclerosis specialist, said the high cost of drugs frustrates him and his colleagues, but ultimately the successful treatment of patients comes first. \"On one hand, we get that,\" he said. \"On the other hand, when you're sitting in the exam room and looking someone in the eye, you can't say, 'I'm not going to treat you because of the cost.' \" ProPublica is a nonprofit investigative reporting newsroom based in New York.",

No matter who wins the presidential election on Tuesday, it's nearly certain Congress will be more narrowly divided come January. And with no clear mandate likely coming out of 2016, there is little reason to be overly optimistic that the next Congress can escape the cycle of unproductivity and polarization that has gripped Washington in recent years. With little chance of a Democratic House takeover in the 2016 election, the two likeliest scenarios are: In the House, Republicans would continue to struggle to find a 218-member governing majority for even the most basic legislative responsibilities. But leaning on Democratic votes to pass bills sparks backlash and anger from the party's right flank. It's the dynamic that troubled former House Speaker John Boehner and ultimately played a role in his decision to resign. Speaker Paul Ryan has received high marks for his transition into the leadership, but the underlying challenge remains the same. 2017 will be a more interesting test of Ryan's leadership and governing abilities, particularly if Hillary Clinton wins and he considers a 2020 presidential bid. Ending the filibuster? In the Senate, the 60-vote threshold for essentially all major legislation is also a significant barrier to the majority party and gives the minority blocking power. There will likely be more debate over whether there needs to be filibuster reform to break the logjam. While ending the filibuster remains unlikely, it is a conversation that has gotten louder in recent years, particularly from liberal Democrats. The 2018 midterms (It's never too early to talk about the next election!) It's a particularly brutal map for Democrats, with the party defending seats in conservative-leaning states like Indiana, Missouri, Montana, North Dakota and West Virginia. That mix will present unique challenges for Democrats to work with or against the party in the White House. If Donald Trump wins ... If Trump wins and Republicans hold both chambers of Congress, there is a more clear possibility for legislative action. A Trump administration could shift tremendous power to the legislative branch. As president, Trump has indicated that he would defer to his vice president for policymaking. A Vice President Mike Pence would have strong relationships on Capitol Hill, particularly with Speaker Ryan. The speaker theorized recently that the only way for government to tackle big issues may be unified control. \"I'm tired of divided government. It doesn't work very well,\" Ryan said before Congress adjourned ahead of Election Day. \"We've gotten some good things done. But the big things \u2014 poverty, the debt crisis, the economy, health care \u2014 these things are stuck in divided government, and that's why we think a unified Republican government is the way to go.\" House Republicans have unveiled a legislative program, entitled \"A Better Way,\" that is the legislative road map for the next Congress if Trump wins. Its proposals are familiar, conservative positions on issues ranging from national security to health care. While Republicans still face a 60-vote hurdle in the Senate, they would have one powerful tool \u2014 budget reconciliation \u2014 to use if government is under GOP control. Budget reconciliation is how President Bush passed tax cuts and President Obama passed the Affordable Care Act. (It requires only a 50 percent-plus-one majority for passage but is limited in its permanence.) It could be a vehicle to repeal Obama's health care law or enact new tax laws, for example. If Hillary Clinton wins ... If Congress is under split control, she will face many of the same challenges President Obama did, particularly in the House, where conservatives hold deep reservations about working with a Clinton administration. Unlike Speaker Ryan, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell contends that split government can still work if key players are willing. \"Divided government is actually the best government,\" McConnell said recently, \"[It's] the best time to tackle really difficult things, because it requires both sides to buy into it to make progress.\" There is an expectation that a Clinton White House would be better than the Obama White House at \"wooing\" Republicans in Congress. There is some optimism that Clinton would be able to find middle ground with enough Republicans on centrist economic proposals, but it's simply too soon to assess whether that is realistic, or whether Clinton pivots to the center (lower business tax rates) or to the left (free college) with her economic priorities. The Supreme Court The next president will have to name a Supreme Court justice as a first order of business, as well as nominate Cabinet secretaries and navigate the Senate confirmation process. Issues: immigration, infrastructure, criminal justice, welfare? As far as issues go, there is little expectation across the political spectrum that 2017 will see resolution on legislation to overhaul the nation's immigration laws or the controversial Trans-Pacific Partnership. Any effort to pass TPP would likely need to be accompanied by a \"side car\" piece of legislation to address lawmakers' concerns about its impact on American workers. TPP itself cannot be renegotiated, despite candidates' assertions otherwise. Speculative areas of compromise include tax legislation, criminal justice reform, and infrastructure (re: jobs) legislation. Congress also has to reauthorize the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program, a federal cash assistance program for low-income families, by September 2017. A key dynamic to keep in mind is that Republicans are generally opposed to any new spending that is not offset elsewhere in the budget. So many of Clinton's spending proposals are dead on arrival in a GOP chamber. This standard also applies to a Trump administration. Any new proposals on new spending or new entitlements \u2014 like paid maternity leave \u2014 are highly unlikely to find the support they need to pass in the next Congress. Republicans have indicated a willingness to negotiate on taxes, but any effort to raise any tax rates would likely have to come at the expense of significant changes to entitlement programs like Medicare and Social Security, which most Democrats reject. In short, another two to four years of split government could produce incremental legislative progress, but grand bargains and sweeping overhauls are unlikely to find a critical mass of lawmakers on Capitol Hill to move forward. The lame-duck session is the name given to the two-month period after an election, but before the new Congress takes over. Here's what Congress likely will deal with \u2014 and what it won't: 1. Spending bills: The main legislative focus is to complete the 2016 spending bills. Only one of the 12 annual bills funding the federal government has become law, mainly due to internal GOP disputes over how much to spend. The current stop-gap bill expires Dec. 9. If Congress can't come to terms in the lame duck, they can punt another stop-gap bill into the next Congress. This is unusual, but not unprecedented. 2. The Cures Act: GOP leaders have said the 21st Century Cures Act, a bill to expand access to biomedical innovations, is a lame-duck priority. 3. Supreme Court, trade: There is no expectation for a Supreme Court nomination hearing for Merrick Garland, or action on the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal.",

When it comes to health care, the choice between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump comes down to whether to keep, or trash, the Affordable Care Act. Trump says he wants to repeal and replace the health care law that is responsible for insuring about 20 million people, while Clinton has vowed to retain it and even expand its reach. Here are the candidates' plans: Clinton's plan maintains the basic structure of Obamacare, with its expansion of Medicaid to more people with higher incomes and the ability to buy insurance through government-run exchanges. But she acknowledges problems with the program in its current form and offers changes to cut consumer costs, rein in drug prices, and ensure more uninsured people get covered. The so-called public option would allow consumers to buy health insurance directly from the federal government. It's proposed in most cases to ensure there are choices for buyers in places where only one insurance company offers policies through the Obamacare exchanges. An analysis of Clinton's plan by the Commonwealth Fund, a private foundation that supports independent health care research, concludes it would boost the number of people with health insurance by about 400,000. But the impact on the federal deficit is unclear: The report says it could range from a small decline to an increase of as much as $90 billion. The Commonwealth analysis doesn't account for Clinton's proposal to allow people to \"buy in\" to Medicare at 55 rather than waiting until 65. That could reduce premiums for younger people who buy insurance through the ACA exchanges but would increase the cost of Medicare, says Joe Antos, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. \"She says 'buy in' because that disguises the fact that there has to be more taxpayer money in the subsidy to work,\" Antos says. If the House remains under Republican control, there's little to no chance the public option or Medicare buy-in will become law. Trump, like most Republicans, says he wants to repeal Obamacare, but he hasn't offered many details about what will happen to the 20 million people who will lose their insurance if that happens. In a speech this week, his running mate, Mike Pence, said Obamacare subsidies would be phased out so consumers could have a smoother transition to new insurance. To buy that insurance, Trump wants to expand the use of health savings accounts, which allow people to save money tax-free to pay for health care costs. He also says allowing insurance companies to sell policies across state lines will cut costs, a notion economists question. The Commonwealth Fund analysis says Trump's proposal would increase the number of people without insurance by as many as 25 million. As with Clinton's plan, the estimates of this plan's impact on the budget is a big range, from no impact to an increase of as much as $41 billion. That's because much of his plan involves tax breaks to encourage people to buy insurance, while taking away the requirement to buy that's embedded in the Affordable Care Act.",

Some of the country's most prominent economists have signed a letter warning that Donald Trump is a \"dangerous, destructive\" choice for president and urging voters to choose someone else. The letter, first reported by The Wall Street Journal, was signed by 370 economists, including eight Nobel Prize winners. The text stops short of endorsing Democrat Hillary Clinton, though, and doesn't criticize Trump on ideological grounds. Instead, it says he has made repeated statements aimed at misleading the public about jobs and growth: \"He misinforms the electorate, degrades trust in public institutions with conspiracy theories, and promotes willful delusion over engagement with reality. If elected, he poses a unique danger to the functioning of democratic and economic institutions, and to the prosperity of the country.\" Among other things, Trump has told voters that renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement or imposing tariffs on China would increase manufacturing jobs, the letter says. \"In fact, manufacturing's share of employment has been declining since the 1970s and is mostly related to automation, not trade,\" it says. Trump has \"lowered the seriousness of the national dialogue\" by saying that the deficit can be reduced by eliminating government agencies such as the Department of Education and the Environmental Protection Agency. \"A credible solution will require an increase in tax revenue and/or a reduction in spending on Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, or Defense,\" it says. The Republican presidential candidate has also falsely claimed that the United States is one of the most heavily taxed countries in the world, the letter says. It added: \"His statements reveal a deep ignorance of economics and an inability to listen to credible experts. He repeats fake and misleading economic statistics, and pushes fallacies about the [value-added tax] and trade competitiveness. He promotes magical thinking and conspiracy theories over sober assessments of feasible economic policy options.\" Those signing the letter say they \"represent a broad variety of areas of expertise.\" They include Nobel winners such as Angus Deaton of Princeton, Oliver Hart and Eric Maskin of Harvard and Kenneth J. Arrow of Stanford, as well as many other prominent academics. A separate letter endorsing Clinton and signed by 19 Nobel laureates was released earlier this week. One of Trump's senior economic advisers, Peter Navarro of the University of California, Irvine, said in an email to NPR that the letter is \"an embarrassment to the corporate offshoring wing of the economist profession who continues to insist bad trade deals are good for America.\" He added: \"You don't need Econ 101 to know Hillary Clinton's plan to raise taxes, increase regulation, raise energy and electricity prices by shutting down our fossil fuel industries, and continue to ship our jobs and factories overseas through bad trade deals will reduce growth, continue stagnant wages, and leave our government without the economic growth it needs to pay for everything from new infrastructure to national defense.  \"You don't need a Ph.D. in economics to know Trump's plan to cut taxes, reduce regulation, increase oil, gas, and clean coal production, and eliminate our trade deficit by increasing exports and reducing imports will significantly increase growth, boost wages, and generate trillions in new tax revenues.\" Navarro also noted that a separate letter signed by 300 economists was released in September warning that Clinton's economic policies were wrong for the country.",

As part of our What's The Issue series, we look at the details.  RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: Health care - and Obamacare in particular - has dominated the debate between Republicans and Democrats for years, until this year. Candidates had plenty to say in campaign 2016 but rarely touched on the issue of America's health care system. Over the past few weeks, MORNING EDITION has hosted a series of conversations called What's The Issue, asking you to tweet us your top election issues with the hashtag #DearWashington. Many of you brought up health care. Here's a sampling. JODY THERON: Dear Washington, everyone in family has asthma. We need daily prescriptions and rescue prescriptions at all times plus regular checkups. COLBY KLAUSE: Dear Washington, I suffer from treatable mental health problems, but I can't afford the treatment. I just want medication to get me back to having a career. JIM FOTH: I can barely afford my health care premiums each month. It's roughly another car payment for me. It's depressing when I think about how good the rest of the world has it. MONTAGNE: How good - how good had the rest of the world has it. That was Jody Theron (ph), Colby Klause (ph) of Nebraska and Jim Foth (ph), just some of the people who reached out to us on how important the issue of health care was to them. With us now to talk about the two major candidates and what they're proposing is NPR health policy correspondent Alison Kodjak. Good morning. ALISON KODJAK, BYLINE: Good morning, Renee. MONTAGNE: Now, health care has not come up, a bit surprisingly, that much in this campaign, but it did come up this week after the Obama administration announced the new rates for insurance plans for 2017. Recap the news for the coming year. KODJAK: The overall rates for insurance bought through the Obamacare exchanges are going to go up an average of 22 percent across the country. Some states, the increases will be bigger, some will be smaller. But for consumers who qualify for subsidies, which are most of them, they won't really see an increase because those subsidies increase along with the rates. MONTAGNE: OK, so not exactly 22 percent there, maybe, for most people. But Donald Trump did come out at a rally in Florida yesterday with a reaction to this news. Let's take a listen. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DONALD TRUMP: Obamacare is just blowing up. And even the White House, our president, announced 25 or 26 percent. That number is so wrong. That is such a phony number. You're talking about 60, 70, 80 percent in increases, not 25 percent. MONTAGNE: Well, 60, 70, 80 - who's right here? KODJAK: Well, the 25 percent number that he's saying is basically the average increase for insurance policies sold on the federal exchange. There are also state exchanges. Their rates are going up a little less. So on average across the country, it's only 22 percent. However, on individual states, the increase could be much higher. In Alabama, for example, it's showing an increase of 58 percent on average. And in Arizona, they're more than doubling. But again, it's state by state. In Indiana, rates are actually looking to go down. But still, for consumers, the subsidies are going to cover most of the increases that are showing on these numbers. MONTAGNE: So let's stay with Donald Trump. What is he proposing to do? KODJAK: Well, let's listen to a bit more about what he said at that rally. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: Obamacare has to be repealed and replaced, and it has to be replaced with something much less expensive for the people. And, otherwise, this country's in even bigger trouble than anybody thought. KODJAK: So Donald Trump has repeatedly called Obamacare a disaster. And he says, like many Republicans do, that he wants to repeal it and replace it. However, he hasn't offered a lot of details about what he's going to replace it with. So he has a couple of specific proposals. One is to expand what are called health savings accounts. And those allow people to save money, tax-free, and use that money to offset their health care costs. And a second proposal he has offered is to allow insurance companies to sell insurance across state lines. Right now, they have to get licensed in every state and sell within different states. He says that by allowing them to sell insurance across state lines, it'll increase competition among insurers and therefore reduce the premiums that are sold. But he doesn't have a lot of details about what'll happen to that 20 million people who've gotten insurance so far under the Affordable Care Act. MONTAGNE: And Hillary Clinton, what is she saying? KODJAK: So Hillary Clinton has a much more detailed plan. Let's start by listening to what she said at the second debate. (SOUNDBITE OF PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE) HILLARY CLINTON: Now, with respect to the Affordable Care Act, I've been saying we've got to fix what's broken and keep what works. And that's exactly what we're going to do. I am committed to making sure that people retain coverage that they can afford. And that is going to require taking on premium cost and deductible cost and prescription drug cost. KODJAK: So what Clinton has said over and over again is that she wants to build on Obamacare - keep what works, get rid of what doesn't. And her central theme has been to figure out how to deal with the cost. Increasing health care costs are the major problem, so she's proposed putting a cap on what people's out of - out-of-pocket health costs can be, taking a look at a big insurance company mergers because she says that is reducing competition and also looking at increasing drug prices. It's been big in the news lately, and she wants to look at why drug companies are raising prices and whether those price increases are justified. MONTAGNE: So in a nutshell, Alison, what are the options that voters have here? KODJAK: Well, if Donald Trump has his way, he will repeal and replace Obamacare, and that will actually end up with 20 million people who have gotten insurance so far having to look for something new. And we don't really know what that something is going to be. If Hillary Clinton gets her way, there'll be a much bigger role of government in health care. She's proposed a couple of other things, including allowing people who are 55 years and older to buy into Medicare earlier than they are currently eligible. And she's brought up the public option again. That's the option of having the government offer health insurance in competition with private companies on the exchanges.

            "article_content": "A leaked video showed Donald Trump (pictured with 'Days of Our Lives' actress Arianne Zucker and then-Access Hollywood co-host Billy Bush) bragging about groping women.\n                \n                    \n                    The Washington Post/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption A leaked video showed Donald Trump (pictured with 'Days of Our Lives' actress Arianne Zucker and then-Access Hollywood co-host Billy Bush) bragging about groping women. How would you describe, in brief, the conversation Republican Presidential candidate Donald Trump had in 2005 with then-Access Hollywood co-host Billy Bush, a recording of which was leaked to the Washington Post last Friday? Lewd? Vulgar? Crude? NPR used all those words in newscasts and headlines when reporting the story, and it has continued to use them occasionally in reporting the continuing drip of allegations this week that Trump has repeatedly behaved improperly toward women. For readers and listeners who contacted my office, those descriptions do not go far enough. Cody McMahan, of Dallas, spoke for many, writing: \"Please stop referring to Donald Trump's comments as 'lewd comments' as though he was caught saying 'dirty words'. He was bragging about nonconsensual sexual behavior.\" And from Mark Swanson, of Evanston, Ill.: \"The NPR news reader refers only to Donald Trump's use of lewd or vulgar language. That is not the story. The story is that Donald Trump is actually bragging about groping women and getting away with it because of his celebrity status.\" Julie Vandenboom of Lansing, Mich., wrote specifically about the use of the word \"groping\" in NPR's reports: \"I'm not sure why you chose to use the word 'groping' rather than 'sexual assault' in your headline about Donald Trump bragging about forcibly touching women's genitals. What factors went into that decision?\" Merriam-Webster defines \"grope\" as \"to touch (someone) in an unwanted and unexpected sexual way.\" By that standard the headline is an accurate description, in my mind. NPR's standards editor Mark Memmott agreed. The descriptions of Trump's behavior as \"lewd\" or \"vulgar\" are also clearly accurate, and they have the advantage of fitting into newscasts and headlines, which have time and space limits. But I, too, felt the language was, at times, not nearly as forceful or complete as it could be. This was particularly the case in some of the weekend newscasts leading up to the Sunday debate where Trump was asked directly about the tape. I asked newsroom executives for their thinking. \"I hesitate for our anchors to make legal judgments about anything,\" Robert Garcia, the executive producer of NPR's newscasts, told me, referring to the listeners who wanted NPR to be clearer that the behavior Trump bragged about was \"sexual assault.\" Garcia explained that a newscast anchor's characterization of what happened \"is going to be buttressed by the next big thing that follows,\" meaning an excerpt from the tape, or audio of, say, presidential candidate debate co-moderator Anderson Cooper asking Trump directly about his remarks. But NPR felt restricted from running, in full, the most relevant parts of the tape where Trump is heard talking about grabbing women in their private parts, Garcia said, due to Federal Communications Commission concerns. (NPR programs are heard on member stations licensed by the FCC, which requires stations to uphold what it calls \"contemporary community standards.\" A detailed explanation of NPR's policy about use of the tape, in the context of FCC regulations, can be found here, in a memo from Memmott.) \"I would like to have had the freedom to put the whole thing out there but one of the considerations we have is the FCC,\" Garcia said. [NPR's media correspondent, David Folkenflik, on Monday disagreed with NPR's decision not to air certain parts of the tape, arguing, \"It's newsworthy for a leading presidential candidate.\" But he noted that the full tape was available at NPR.org and through myriad other news sources.] I understand the legal concerns cited by Garcia, and some of the alternatives that listeners suggested clearly went further than the NPR lawyers would have approved. But I do think there were other ways to more clearly characterize more of the content of the tape early on, without running into legal hurdles. \"Certainly by Sunday we could have figured out a way to tell listeners these comments weren't just lewd and vulgar,\" Memmott agreed. But, he added, he felt the totality of the coverage was clear. Indeed, in one of the first pieces NPR aired after the story broke, Weekend Edition Saturday host Scott Simon was very clear about what Trump said, telling listeners: \"In it, Trump brags in graphic, vulgar language of trying to commit adultery and forcing himself on women.\" After I spoke to Garcia earlier this week, he followed up to highlight the approach Lakshmi Singh took in Tuesday newscasts that he said he felt \"touched on the issue with the appropriate amount of nuance.\" In the 1 p.m., ET newscast that day, reporting House Speaker Paul Ryan's decision to distance himself from Trump, she said: \"...Ryan backed out to help focus on helping fellow Republicans get re-elected. He announced the decision after The Washington Post released a 2005 recording of Trump bragging about groping women, which without their consent, would be sexual assault. In the second debate with Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump told a moderator he never forced himself on women. NPR's Sarah McCammon reports Trump's vulgar remarks remain a politically explosive issue for the Republican party.\" Garcia said: \"This exposition reflects an if/then approach that avoids the declaration he is guilty of sexual assault while maintaining, it could well be if there was non-consent. It also represents Trump's position at the debate claiming that he never forced himself on women.\" I like that language; I just wish NPR had gotten there sooner and used it, or some variation, more often. On to the latest campaign tracking report from my office. As a reminder, we are tracking NPR's coverage of presidential candidates, online and on its morning and evening newsmagazines, in response to requests from listeners. From Sept. 25 through Oct. 8, 43 stories focused primarily on Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, compared with 22 stories focused mostly on Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson was the main focus of three stories during that period; none focused on Green Party candidate Jill Stein. Another 85 stories looked at more than one candidate, or general election issues. This tracking period included the first presidential debate and the sole vice presidential debate. The debates led to more coverage about the election in general rather than about the individual candidates, when compared to previous tracking periods. My office continues to field many complaints that there are simply too many stories about Trump and his troubles. The Democratic and Republican party candidates received almost equal coverage in the first week of the tracking period, but Trump received two-and-a-half times more coverage in the second week. That was the week when The New York Times first reported Trump's 1995 tax returns (showing his $916 million in business losses), followed by the early reports on the leaked Access Hollywood video. As we have been doing since early summer, this column is highlighting stories that rise above the day-to-day of the campaigns and examine the candidates' policy proposals and stances on specific issues. There were only a handful of such stories among the 153 stories we tracked over the course of the past two weeks, but they tackled important issues, looking at the candidates' plans for America's schools, gun regulations, nuclear weapons, and Social Security and Medicare. And one online-only story looked at where the vice presidential candidates differ from their running mates on the issues. Editorial researcher Annie Johnson and intern Anna Mazarakis contributed to this report.",

Social Security alone consumes nearly a quarter of the federal budget. At this week's vice presidential debate, Democrat Tim Kaine and Republican Mike Pence spoke about how the administrations they hope to join would deal with the challenges facing safety net programs like it. The Challenge Social Security is a pay-as-you-go program, in which benefits for retirees and others are largely funded through the payroll taxes collected from current workers. As baby boomers retire, there will be more people drawing benefits out of the system and relatively fewer workers paying in. The Social Security trust fund helps to cushion that gap. But forecasters expect the trust fund will be exhausted in about 20 years. Once that happens, there will still be enough money coming into the system from payroll taxes to cover about 75 percent of retirees' benefits. But in order to keep paying 100 percent, some changes will be needed. The sooner policymakers act, the less drastic those changes will need to be. The Fixes Lots of different fixes have been suggested for Social Security but they basically boil down to a few: cut benefits, increase taxes, or some combination of the two. Ideas such as raising the retirement age or adopting less generous cost-of-living adjustments are effectively benefit cuts. Likewise, tax increases could take many forms. Hillary Clinton Hillary Clinton has ruled out cutting benefits. In fact, she wants to increase benefits for some people, including widows and those who drop out of the workforce temporarily to care for family members. \"We have too many Social Security recipients right now who are barely making it,\" Clinton said in a town hall with MSNBC earlier this year. Clinton is banking on some form of tax increase to ensure Social Security can keep paying its bills. \"We need to get more money into the Social Security trust fund to keep it solvent far into the future,\" Clinton told MSNBC. \"There are a couple of different ways I'm looking at. And I'll have to talk with the Congress to try to figure out what's the best way forward.\" One idea Clinton has floated is lifting the cap on income subject to the Social Security tax. Right now, income over $118,500 is not taxed for Social Security. If that cap were eliminated and benefits were unchanged, that would solve about  88 percent of Social Security's long-run funding problem. (By comparison, adopting a less generous cost-of-living formula would solve about 20 percent of the problem and gradually raising the retirement age would solve about 40 percent.) Clinton has also suggested taxing capital gains and other investment income to help fund Social Security. Donald Trump Like Hillary Clinton, Trump has rejected any kind of benefits cut. Unlike Clinton, he's not looking to raise taxes. \"We're going to save Social Security,\" Trump told supporters at an Iowa campaign rally late last year. \"We're not going to raise the age and we're not going to do all the things that everybody else is talking about doing. They're all talking about doing it and you don't have to. We're going to bring our jobs back. We're going to make our economy incredible again.\" Stronger economic growth would help because more jobs and bigger paychecks would mean more payroll taxes flowing into the system. But many observers are skeptical that the United States can realistically achieve the kind of growth rates needed to fix Social Security without other changes. Trump's immigration policies could also aggravate the funding challenge. He's called for deporting millions of immigrants living in the country illegally. Many of those immigrants pay into the Social Security system but don't draw benefits, effectively subsidizing U.S. citizens. Medicare provides health benefits for older Americans. In recent years, Medicare costs have been rising more slowly than they used to, but they're still climbing faster than the overall economy. Unless policymakers get a handle on those costs, taxpayers will be on the hook for growing expenses. Clinton and Trump agree on some measures, such as trying to rein in the costs of prescription drugs. And both Clinton and Trump reject the idea of gradually converting Medicare to a voucher system in which the government subsidizes private insurance for future retirees. That plan is still an option in the GOP platform, however. Trump has also promised to repeal the Affordable Care Act, including pilot programs that aim to promote more efficient delivery of health care.",

It's a headline you can write every election year: FLORIDA THE BIG BATTLEGROUND IN THIS YEARS' RACE TO THE WHITE HOUSE But that banner belies significant changes taking place in rapid fashion. In fact, if your image of Florida politics is senior citizens peppering candidates with questions about Social Security and Medicare, it's time for an update. Or a new headline. Perhaps something like this: MILLENNIALS A RISING FORCE IN FLORIDA ELECTIONS Senior citizens \u2013 now mostly Baby Boomers \u2013 are still a large section of voters in the state. And it remains a popular retirement community for so-called snow birds from up north. But the census bureau figures show that the number of Floridians aged 18-34 now outnumber those over age 65. And those millennials are far more diverse and more liberal \u2013 especially on social issues \u2013 than their older counterparts. They also have very different expectations from government and from other institutions, including the media. But if millennials are indeed going to wield clout equal to their growing numbers, they are going to have to get out and vote. Their participation in this year's Florida primary was up but still lags behind overall turnout rates statewide. It's fair to say that the 2016 election is NOT something people are feeling inspired by. Certainly, that's true of young voters as well, with the added frustration that many of the issues they feel so strongly about aren't a major part of the discussion by the major party candidates. A group of seven young professionals from the Tampa area gathered to talk about the campaign on a recent weekday at a downtown restaurant. They varied in political ideology \u2014 but their shared thoughts about this election revealed disgust with the process, but also fascination. \"It's been very entertaining. Like a reality TV show almost,\" said Chris Chambers, a 33-year-old military veteran and Tampa power company employee. On one hand, 26-year-old Tampa attorney Rebecca Arends says \"I think it's fantastic that everyone is so passionate about it,\" but on the other hand she quickly adds \"This has been a pretty dirty campaign, it's been a circus, and that's what worries me going forward.\" Arends is an independent who supports Clinton, though she acknowledges that the once enthusiastic backing for the Democratic nominee is waning as the campaign wears on. Chambers, meanwhile, is a Republican who says he's undecided. But as an African-American, he adds that he's not a Trump fan, in part because of how Trump talks about race. He describes his own politics as, \"Republican. Not far right, in between.\" Dave Loos, 34, works in contract furniture sales in Tampa. After supporting Marco Rubio in the primary, Loos is now a Trump fan. While he likes Trump's business acumen and the strength he projects, he finds the tone of the election frustrating.\n                \n                    \n                    Meg Kelly/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Dave Loos, 34, works in contract furniture sales in Tampa.

Dave Loos, 34, works in contract furniture sales in Tampa and is a Donald Trump fan. Earlier in the year, he supported Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. He says he likes the strength Trump projects, but still gets frustrated at the tone of the campaign, saying at times the debate sounds like \"little children.\" Rachel Canipe, 25, listens to all of this from the end of the lunch table. She works in digital media and is a Clinton supporter, but says of the options this election, \"it's just an unfortunate selection that we have.\" Amplifying such millennial dissatisfaction is the fact that Hillary Clinton and Trump \u2014 age wise \u2014 are a throwback to the baby boom after the relative youthfulness of President Obama. Canipe adds, \"I am not satisfied that either of them really know what it's like to be a millennial or what we care about or value.\" She cites what she calls \"educational inflation\" \u2014 the idea that you need a college degree even for jobs that in the past wouldn't have required one. And for so many millennials, what comes along with that is \"crippling student debt,\" according to Canipe. One thing that really irks these young professionals who are eager to get ahead and are active in clubs and networking groups to help them do so \u2013 it's that frequent portrayal of millennials as pessimists who are detached from politics and other kinds of community involvement. \"Everyone says millennials are apathetic,\" said 29-year-old Megan Wade of Tampa. That's not true, she counters. \"I think people are getting more engaged.\" Still, she does say that her generation is more realistic than those before it \"when it comes to our expectations of government and what government going to do for us, versus what we need to do and take personal responsibility on.\" Wade does community outreach for a volunteer organization and is a Democrat who supported Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders before switching to Clinton after the primaries. Zach Lombardo, 26 is an attorney in Tampa, FL. This election, he's voting for Libertarian Gary Johnson. He's not surprised by Trump's use of media in this election noting, \"It's like what 24 hour news coverage plus one,\" referring to social media.\n                \n                    \n                    Meg Kelly/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Zach Lombardo, 26 is an attorney in Tampa, FL.

Despite the different ideologies represented around the lunch table \u2013 three Democrats, two Republicans, and Independent and a Libertarian \u2013 there was a consensus around Wade's skepticism about the effectiveness of government. For 26-year-old Zach Lombardo, an attorney who says he's voting for Libertarian Gary Johnson for president, there's another new reality. Just about everyone around this table grumbled about the tone of the campaign on social media. But, Lombardo said, \"get used to it\". \"It's like 24-hour news coverage plus one,\" he says. Adding that it shouldn't surprise anyone. \"This is just what an election looks like.\" Meaning what we're seeing in 2016 is just the beginning \u2013 and is likely a preview of elections to come.",

Rushing to establish the rules of the road for the upcoming national elections, federal courts in recent weeks have issued a cascade of decisions rolling back restrictive voting laws enacted in the aftermath of a major Supreme Court decision. In 2013, the high court struck down a key section of the 1965 Voting Rights Act. No longer would areas of the country with a history of discrimination in voting be required to pre-clear all changes in voting laws and procedures. \"Our country has changed,\" wrote Chief Justice John Roberts for the conservative five-justice majority. Nearly 50 years after the Voting Rights Act became law, he said, instances of blatant race-based discrimination were rare. But as soon as the covered state and local governments were freed from the pre-clearance mandate, Republican legislatures in some 17 states adopted new laws that civil rights groups said were targeted at suppressing the minority vote. Among the controversial measures: strict voter ID requirements, elimination of early voting days, and a variety of other provisions. The Supreme Court, for the most part, allowed those restrictions to remain in place for the 2014 elections, arguing that the fall of an election year is too late to intervene without causing chaos and confusion. This year the shoe is on the other foot. Courts have fairly consistently been striking down those restrictions, culminating in some big wins for civil rights forces in late July and early August. The biggest win for voting rights advocates was in North Carolina, where a federal appeals court panel unanimously threw out not only the voter ID requirements, but numerous other provisions that the court said were enacted with the intent of making it harder for minorities to vote. The judges pointedly observed that Republican leaders drew up the new laws in North Carolina only after receiving data showing that African-American voters would be the most significantly and adversely affected. \"We cannot ignore the record evidence that, because of race, the legislature enacted one of the largest restrictions of the franchise in modern North Carolina history,\" the panel wrote. The other huge win was in Texas, where the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, perhaps the most conservative federal appeals court in the country, balked at the Texas voter ID law, ordering the lower court to make it easier for people to vote. Similar rulings followed in Wisconsin, Ohio and South Dakota. And in Kansas, a state with a foreign-born population of 6.8 percent, courts have repeatedly rejected efforts by the Republican secretary of state to require voters to provide proof of citizenship to vote. When they were first proposed, voter ID laws sounded reasonable to lots of people, including the Supreme Court. The Justices upheld an Indiana voter ID law in 2008. But even the judges who wrote key opinions upholding the law in that case have since expressed concerns about how voter ID laws work out in practice. Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens and Judge Richard Posner have noted that the Indiana case came to them as a blanket challenge to the law, without an evidentiary trial. Both have since suggested that the proof offered subsequently in other states shows these laws are aimed at suppressing the minority vote. In defense of these laws, the states have said that they are aimed at preventing voter fraud, but court decisions this year have pointed to study after study showing there is virtually no evidence of so-called in-person voter fraud in modern times. While there may well have been such fraud at other points in American history, and while there have been limited examples of absentee ballot fraud, there are precious few examples today of people showing up at the polls to cast a ballot they are not entitled to cast. Indeed, judges have used words like \"phantom\" to describe the problem of voter fraud. The states maintain that it's easy to get a government ID to present at the polls, but the courts respond, in essence, \"not so fast.\" In Texas, for instance, the district court found that some 600,000 eligible voters didn't have one of the IDs required under state law to cast a ballot. Many people don't drive, and states may accept a hunting license or a military ID as legitimate identification, but not a government employee card or student ID, or a Medicaid or Medicare card. So this week Texas agreed that for this election it would allow people who don't have the requisite ID to sign an affidavit at the polls, swearing to their identity, as long as they have some form of identification. These voting battles are far from over, but for those states like North Carolina that are making an 11th hour pitch to the Supreme Court, asking the justices to block the appeals court ruling, there may not be the votes to do that. Many of the justices may already consider it too late to intervene. More to the point, the Supreme Court remains an eight-justice court since the death of Justice Antonin Scalia last February. So even if the court were to split along liberal-conservative lines, there would be a 4-4 tie, and the existing lower court decision would stand.",

The phrasing is significant, in that it references both Clinton's general-election campaign slogan, \"Stronger Together,\" and the animating issue and the heart of Sanders primary bid \u2014 income inequality. The question remaining is how enthusiastically does Sanders endorse Clinton? It has been 27 days since the last contest in the Democratic primary, and Sanders has held off from making an endorsement, though he has inched closer over the past couple of weeks. Over the weekend, Democrats came together in Orlando, Fla., to debate the party's platform. The platform now endorses a $15 minimum wage among other issues Sanders had been fighting for in his campaign. \"We have made enormous strides,\" Sanders said in a release from his campaign. \"Thanks to the millions of people across the country who got involved in the political process \u2014 many for the first time \u2014 we now have the most progressive platform in the history of the Democratic Party.\" On Saturday, Clinton's campaign announced an expansion of her health care proposals that brings her closer to Sanders' call for Medicare for all. \"Hillary will pursue efforts to give Americans in every state in the country the choice of a public-option insurance plan, and to expand Medicare by allowing people 55 years or older to opt in while protecting the traditional Medicare program,\" the campaign wrote. Negotiations over the platform, Clinton's health care announcement over the weekend and a college affordability announcement last week have been key in moving Sanders toward Tuesday's expected endorsement.",

Congress should move to slow spending in Medicare's drug benefit by adopting a package of changes that could save billions of dollars, but that would also add costs for insurers and have mixed effects on enrollees, an independent advisory commission said Wednesday. The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission warned in its June report to Congress that rising drug costs and other factors helped drive Medicare Part D spending up nearly 60 percent between 2007 and 2014. MedPAC recommendations are considered influential, but don't expect Congress to pursue those changes during an election year. Still, the commission makes proposals it estimates could save at least $10 billion over five years, partly by encouraging more use of generic drugs and also by creating incentives for insurers to negotiate better prices from drugmakers. The proposals would: Patient groups like the idea of reducing generic copayments for low-income enrollees and setting an annual cap, yet they fear that the proposal would mean patients would remain in the coverage gap known as the \"doughnut hole\" for longer periods. While in the doughnut hole, enrollees pay a higher percentage of drug costs. MedPAC estimates that its proposal would mean about half of beneficiaries whose drug spending is high enough to hit this gap would remain in it longer, paying about $1,000 more each as a result. \"We're pleased that some of the recommendations would protect beneficiaries from the rising cost of medications ... but we have concerns that fewer beneficiaries would benefit from the out-of-pocket maximum,\" said Stacy Sanders, federal policy director for the Medicare Rights Center. Some proposals have been rejected before, but the report could spark discussion under a new administration and Congress in 2017. \"Once MedPAC makes a recommendation, it gives it legitimacy,\" Sanders said. \"In future years, we could see the proposals as a starting point for some legislation.\" This year, the doughnut hole occurs after patients and their insurers combined have spent $3,310 on covered drugs. In the coverage gap, enrollees must pay a larger share of the cost of their drugs until catastrophic coverage kicks in. That happens when spending hits $4,850 and enrollees then pay 5 percent of the cost of their drugs. While 5 percent isn't much when a low-cost generic is taken, it can be substantial for expensive drugs, such as many used to treat hepatitis, cancer, multiple sclerosis and some forms of arthritis. The Affordable Care Act gradually phases out the coverage gap by requiring drugmakers to give enrollees discounts. This year, the discount is 50 percent of the cost of the drug. Even though enrollees are not paying that discounted amount out of their own pockets, the ACA allowed the dollar value to count toward the $4,850 threshold for catastrophic coverage to begin. Since the ACA took effect, the number of Medicare Part D enrollees who reach the catastrophic coverage level has grown from 400,000 in 2010 to 700,000 by 2013, according to MedPAC. That shift costs Medicare and taxpayers more because the program pays 80 percent of the costs for drugs after enrollees go through the coverage gap. Under the commission's proposal, enrollees would no longer be allowed to count those drugmaker discounts toward the total, meaning it would take longer to hit the out-of-pocket cap. Indeed, about half of enrollees might not reach the threshold in a given year and not benefit from the 100 percent coverage, the report notes. \"For many people, this will actually increase spending,\" said Caroline Pearson of consulting firm Avalere in Washington, D.C., which is in the process of analyzing the financial impacts of the MedPAC proposals. \"While our results aren't finalized yet, our generalized finding is that a small number of beneficiaries would save a lot of money ... but a lot would spend more.\" Other elements of the proposal would affect insurers. MedPAC recommends insurers shoulder more of the cost of prescriptions after enrollees exit the doughnut hole. That would encourage insurers to try to keep enrollees from hitting the coverage gap's upper limit by getting them to choose lower-cost drugs or by driving harder bargains with drugmakers, said Mark Miller, executive director of the commission. \"A good portion of that payment is because beneficiaries are either using more expensive drugs or the prices of their drugs are going up relatively aggressively,\" said Miller. \"We're trying to say ... you're going to want to negotiate as tough prices as you can.\" MedPAC says the proposals are needed because rising drug prices and other factors helped drive spending in the program to $73 billion in 2014, and more high-cost drugs will hit the market soon. Without action, the rising costs could drive up program costs and probably premiums for enrollees, MedPAC said. When MedPAC adopted its recommendations unanimously this spring, they drew mixed reviews and many comments from the drug industry, consumer groups and insurers. All the groups found elements they liked in the plans and parts they opposed. Little change was seen in the final version released to Congress. \"PhRMA remains concerned about the sweeping recommendations MedPAC approved in April and opposes changes to Medicare Part D that taken together could harm beneficiaries by eroding coverage and protections for many of the most vulnerable enrollees in the program,\" said Allyson Funk, spokeswoman for the drug industry's trade group PhRMA.

Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., on Tuesday in Carson, Calif.\n                \n                    \n                    Jae C. Hong/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Brooke Peterson poses for photos with a sign at a rally for Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., on Tuesday in Carson, Calif. For some weeks now, as Bernie Sanders has extended his remarkable and improbable run as a presidential candidate, people have been asking: \"What does Bernie want?\" That question is a distant echo of \"What does Jesse want?\" a relic of the 1988 runner-up candidacy of Jesse Jackson, another \"outsider\" challenger with a dedicated hardcore following. But more about Jackson in a moment. This week, the question took a different form. After a rowdy convention in Nevada prompted death threats against that state party chair, the question suddenly became: \"Are the Democrats coming apart?\" Uniting for the fall has always been an issue for both parties. But this year, it was supposed to be the Republicans, with their 17 candidates and their frustrated #NeverTrump rearguard action, who broke up over their differences. Now, it's working out quite differently. So we hear again that old nostrum: \"Democrats want to fall in love, Republicans want to fall in line.\" A remarkable number of Republicans have accepted, if not embraced, Donald Trump as their nominee. But a large contingent of Democrats continue to feel the Bern, or at least remain very much out of love with Hillary Clinton. Which brings us to this past weekend, which proved that sometimes what happens in Vegas does not stay in Vegas. The \"Nevada fracas\" has created a media meme and a conversational focus for the conflict roiling the Democratic Party. That is because it encapsulates the grievances felt on both sides. Sanders supporters see that some of their number were not seated in Las Vegas and see evidence that the system is rigged against them. Clinton supporters hear the epithets hurled at women on that stage, including the state party chair and Sen. Barbara Boxer, and perceive evidence of something else. Others will adjudicate what happened in Las Vegas, where both candidates' camps seem to think they were entitled to a majority of delegates. (Although Clinton won the initial round of caucuses back in February, Sanders had the upper hand in an intermediate round at the county level on April 2.) One camp wanted an open process; the other wanted respect for the rules. A voice vote was gaveled to a conclusion despite an uncertain outcome, which is bound to cause trouble. But in the end, the party chair herself has come to seem the principal victim \u2014 \"more sinned against than sinning\" \u2014 because of extreme phone and online harassment. Nevada's convention seems to have been an egregious case, an outlier. In other states where actual delegates are chosen in several phases, regular order has been followed without a similar outburst. But exceptions to the rule often make news. And in this case, cable TV and social media have endlessly repeated the raucous video shot at the convention and the toxic harassment that followed. As Nevada became a national story, Sanders was pressured to respond. The candidate has condemned violence generically, but has not apologized for his backers. Instead, Sanders and his retinue have denied responsibility for what happened and doubled down on their long-simmering resentments against Democratic Party officials. They say the entire process has been rigged against them, even parts that have been in place for decades. And the implicit message has been: Treat us fairly or expect there to be consequences. When this message is combined with Sanders' vow this week to \"carry our fight to the convention,\" it darkens the portents for the national convention in Philadelphia. So what does Bernie want? Let's start with the obvious: He wants to be nominated and elected. That's understood. Every candidate has a perfect right to continue fighting until the last ballot is cast, as Sanders vows to do. But even if he wins California, and several other states on June 7, Sanders would need vertiginous victory margins to win enough delegates to close the pledged delegate gap with Clinton. (The Democrats divide delegates proportionally according to the popular vote, which is just about as democratic a method as you can imagine.) So Sanders' one path is to persuade superdelegates to prefer him over Clinton, even though they currently prefer Clinton by more than 10-1. (The only superdelegate to flip so far deserted Sanders for the front-runner.) Sanders and his spokespersons say superdelegates should now ignore the overall vote and the pledged delegate totals and look at how much better Sanders does against Trump in hypothetical November matchups. The only problem is that hypothetical tests six months before the election are notoriously unreliable. Just ask President Perot. Moreover, many of the poll respondents who create this November differential right now are Sanders supporters who say they will shift to Trump in November. The likelihood of their actually doing so is problematic, given past experience with disgruntled backers of other candidates who fell short. (The most recent example would be the Clinton backers in 2008 who swore they would not vote for the man who beat her, Barack Obama, but wound up doing so in the fall.) So the \"path to the nomination\" for Sanders is not just uphill, it is essentially vertical. So what else might Sanders want? No one seems to think Sanders wants to be vice president or have any other role in a Clinton administration. He would return to the Senate, where he would be in a wholly new weight class of political influence. But he clearly wants to make a difference, to alter how the Democrats go forward in the fall campaign and beyond. And that is what the Clinton camp must manage. It is entirely possible that the Democratic convention in Philadelphia this July will vote to change party rules, shrinking the number of superdelegates or requiring them to follow the voting results in their states. It is also possible, if less likely, that the party would agree to allow more independents a role in its nominating process (although this would still depend on the will of the various states). Sanders supporters will also strive to make the party platform more progressive, raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour and expanding Medicare to cover people of all ages and perhaps calling for free tuition at public colleges. (The platform already calls for much of Sanders' program regarding the campaign finance system and other issues.) This might fall far short of the \"political revolution\" Sanders says his campaign is about. But it could still matter. And it could still point the party toward a far more progressive future. That is one way in which the 1988 precedent is relevant. Jesse Jackson arrived in Atlanta with about 30 percent of the delegates (not nearly as many as Sanders will have this summer). At the time, it was easily the best showing for an African-American presidential candidate. And although Jackson was not going to be nominated (Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis had a first-ballot majority), his message of racial and economic inclusion was popular and powerful within the party's base. The Dukakis forces recognized this and turned the proceedings over to Jackson on the second night of the convention. Thousands of Jackson supporters jammed the arena while delegates, alternates and journalists waited outside \u2014 unable to enter. Jackson gave an hourlong oration on the theme of common ground, a siege gun speaking for unity. Jackson did his part in the fall, helping Dukakis carry nearly 90 percent of the black vote and 70 percent of the then-minuscule Hispanic vote. Unfortunately for Dukakis, minority voters cast only about one ballot in seven in 1988. But by 2012, the share of the vote cast by people of color had nearly doubled. That stunning growth has turned a dozen states that were red in 1988 to blue in 2012 (California, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Michigan, New Jersey, Virginia, Maryland, New Mexico, Connecticut, New Hampshire, Delaware and Vermont). The same demographic trends have made Florida, Ohio and Colorado toss-ups in presidential elections. All had been solidly Republican in 1988. Sanders' hard base is not among minorities, of course, but among younger voters. His success has been built on winning three-fourths or even more of the voters under age 30. That is a group Clinton will need in the fall just as much as Dukakis needed Jackson's base in 1988. Sanders may not want a Jackson-style prime-time convention session all his own. He might be willing to settle for platform and rules revisions that would validate his campaign. But if he wants a Bernie night in Philadelphia when he can bring his political revolution to life \u2014 even for a few hours \u2014 it might be a small price to pay for peace.",

Older voters might wonder this campaign season whether presidential candidates are taking them for granted.

And I live on Social Security, so we need more,\" Pavini says. \"We need to live. We can't survive; we'll be out in the street.\" Ward lives with her niece because she says she doesn't get enough money from Social Security. \"If something should happen to her, I don't know what would happen with me,\" she says. To be fair, candidates have discussed Social Security some. Months ago, Republican candidates talked about cuts, though the apparent nominee, Donald Trump, has said he's against that. Democrats Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton both want to expand benefits, though their plans differ. And they've both talked about opening up Medicare to younger people. But at the senior center, people raised other issues, too, like continuing education for older adults and affordable housing. Without exception, Clinton was their choice for president. But concern about these issues \u2014 and their neglect in this campaign \u2014 cuts across party lines. David Cole, 60, was a delegate to the recent California Republican convention, so he follows politics pretty closely. \"I've heard nothing from any candidate other than some doublespeak we hear in every election,\" he says. Cole finds that's unfortunate. He has a particular interest in older Americans not just because of his own age, but because he's a developer of assisted living facilities. Those aren't cheap. But he notes that people now in middle age have saved next to nothing for retirement. \"Those people who are in their 60s, 50s and 40s, I don't know where they're going have the money to afford what I do for a living,\" he says. \"So there needs to be another model [for retirement] out there, and no one's talking about the future. And it concerns me a lot.\" It concerns Ken Dychtwald, too. He's the CEO of a research and survey company called Age Wave. By the year 2030, he notes, one in five Americans will be 65 and older. \"Are we prepared?\" he asks. \"No. Are the candidates addressing this age wave and offering innovative solutions? No.\" In a conference call with reporters, Dychtwald lists a host of issues that the candidates should be forced to address, including the retraining of older workers, finding a cure for Alzheimer's disease and combating ageism. \"I am absolutely outraged that these core issues have not been meaningfully covered, if covered at all, during the presidential debates and interviews,\" Dychtwald says. There's a good reason for that, says Jack Pitney, a professor of government at Claremont McKenna College. \"Hillary Clinton will be 69 on Election Day and Donald Trump will be 70. This will be the oldest pair of nominees that we've ever had,\" he says. Pitney said the candidates may not want voters to wonder how old is too old while they're making up their minds.",

            "article_content": "Hillary Clinton is floating a proposal to let people over the age of 50 \"buy in\" to Medicare, the federal government's health insurance for those 65 and older. The Democratic presidential contender mentioned the idea earlier this week at a campaign event in Stone Ridge, Va. She was responding to a woman who said her health insurance premiums \u2014 which she bought on the individual market \u2014 rose more than $500 last year. \"What you're saying is one of the real worries that we're facing with the cost of health insurance,\" Clinton said. \"The costs are going up in many markets.\" Clinton suggested that removing older people from the market would lower costs. And their own costs wouldn't necessarily go up, she said, because they'd be part of such a big group. \"If you were able to let people 55 or 50 [years old] and up who are the biggest users of health care into the Medicare program \u2014 they would have to buy in, but they would be buying into such a big program that the costs would be more distributed,\" Clinton said. Clinton's campaign hasn't offered any more details. But the mention has raised the possibility that Clinton may use the idea of a Medicare buy-in to rekindle the debate over the so-called public option \u2014 having a government health insurance plan compete with private companies. The idea could help control health care spending, advocates say. Jacob Hacker, director of the Institution for Social and Policy Studies at Yale University, says Clinton's idea could slow down health care inflation because Medicare is very efficient. \"While Medicare is often criticized as not being effective enough at cost control, in fact Medicare has done a better job than private plans in restraining prices,\" Hacker says. Hacker became known as the \"father of the public option\" during the 2010 debate over the Affordable Care Act because he was an early proponent of the idea. He says Medicare, or another government plan, is in the best position to lower overall costs because the government can best negotiate lower payments for doctor visits, tests and medications. \"Dealing with our health care costs crisis, and it is a crisis \u2014 it's the No. 1 threat to our budget \u2014 is going to require putting significant pressure on the medical industrial complex,\" he says. The public option died in 2010 when Republicans and some Democrats opposed the idea of having the government compete with the medical insurance industry. But Clinton, in her campaign materials, says she wants to bring it back. Letting people buy in to Medicare could be a first step, Hacker says. \"If you go into the health insurance exchange, you could conceivably choose between a range of private plans and the Medicare program,\" he says. Reaching Out To Sanders Supporters Clinton may also be broaching the idea to appeal to Bernie Sanders supporters who like his proposal to offer a government health insurance plan to everyone \u2014 which he calls Medicare for All. Sanders' plan has been criticized because of its potential cost. He says the plan will cost about $1.38 trillion a year and would be paid for by tax increases on individuals and employers. Many economists dispute his estimates. A new analysis by the Urban Institute says it would cost more than twice that amount. Linda Blumberg, a senior fellow in the Health Policy Center at the Urban Institute, says a Medicare buy-in may not be as simple as it sounds. Putting people ages 50 to 65 in a pool with the elderly could end up costing them more because they're associated with the biggest and most expensive health care consumers. And Medicare is more fragmented than regular insurance, with separate programs to pay for hospitals, doctors and prescriptions. So Clinton would have to decide whether to leave Medicare as is or create something more like traditional insurance for these younger customers. \"If we're going to provide something that looks like a cohesive package for the non-elderly through Medicare, then I think we need to be thinking about why we're not doing that for the elderly as well,\" Blumberg says. Tom Miller, a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, also sees unintended consequences in moving people from private insurance into Medicare. Doctors and hospitals charge private insurers more to make up for the low payments from Medicare, he says, and Clinton's idea just moves more of the costs from one group to another. \"It's like saying, 'Let's move this pothole over to another place where you're not driving and someone else will run into it,' \" Miller says. \"You can't hide the problem \u2014 you can move it around to a different set of pockets.\" Miller says health care for people over 50 just costs a lot of money. If Clinton wants to reduce those costs, he suspects people will end up with fewer benefits, or taxpayers will end up subsidizing their insurance even more.",

            "article_content": "House Speaker Paul Ryan met with the de facto nominee of the Republican Party Donald Trump Thursday and called the conversation encouraging and a good first step, while acknowledging that the two have legitimate policy differences.  ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: Donald Trump met with House and Senate Republican leaders today in a series of private meetings across Capitol Hill. The question at hand - can Republicans put aside their differences and unite behind a Trump candidacy? NPR congressional reporter Susan Davis starts us off with this report. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: (Chanting) R-I-P G-O-P. UNIDENTIFIED CROWD: (Chanting) R-I-P G-O-P, R-I-P G-O-P, R-I-P G-O-P. SUSAN DAVIS, BYLINE: The street surrounding the Republican National Committee were filled with the sounds of discord from anti-Trump activists like this impersonator who mocked Trump's indifference to the Washington establishment. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Me and my cohorts will bring a new future to Washington, D.C. Actually we're going to move it to New York, but I haven't told them that. DAVIS: Inside the RNC, the conversation was all about party unity. It was the first major face-to-face meeting between Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan. The speaker has very publicly declined to endorse his party's expected nominee. After nearly two hours of private meetings with Trump and other Republican leaders, Ryan sized him up this way. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PAUL RYAN: His personality I thought was - I thought he has a very good personality. He's a very, warm and genuine person. DAVIS: He's a person Ryan could see himself endorsing, but he's still not there. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) RYAN: I think we had a very encouraging meeting. Look, it's no secret that Donald Trump and I have had our differences. We talked about those differences today. DAVIS: Ryan wouldn't divulge the details of that part of the conversation, but their differences are well documented. Ryan has been a critic of Trump's call to ban Muslims from entering the country. He's also against Trump's proposals to raise the minimum wage, increase taxes on the wealthy and keep the current Medicare system as is - just to name a few. But Ryan said he and Trump agree on core principles for the party, the big ideas. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) RYAN: Principles like the Constitution, the separation of powers, the fact that we have an executive that is going way beyond the boundaries of the Constitution and how it's important to us that we restore article one of the Constitution. It's the principle of self-government. We talked about life and how strongly we feel about this core principle. We talked about the Supreme Court and things like this. DAVIS: And Ryan credits Trump for bringing new voters to the Republican Party. He says the challenge now is to welcome these newcomers without alienating more traditional party voters in the general election. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) RYAN: So the question is - and this is what we think we can be a party to helping - how do we unify it all so this is really a big and growing movement? How do we keep adding and adding and adding voters while not subtracting any voters? DAVIS: For their part, Democrats scoff at the suggestion that Republicans will be able to run on the parts of Trump's agenda they like and ignore the parts they don't. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi says too many House Republicans agree with Trump on his more controversial opinions to be able to draw any distinction between the top and bottom of the ticket this November. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) NANCY PELOSI: Whether it's insulting President Obama, women, immigrants, Muslims, LGBT Americans - there's not a dime's worth of difference between what Donald Trump says and what the House Republicans have been saying all along. DAVIS: Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn also took part in the Trump sessions. He says some of his colleagues did raise the issue of Trump's tone on the campaign trail. Cornyn told reporters Trump was receptive to those concerns. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JOHN CORNYN: I think he listened. Obviously he's never run for public office before, and so this is a new experience for him and for us. DAVIS: The next step in this unification process is for Ryan and Trump's respective policy teams to figure out more specifically what they can agree on. And that could require more meetings.

            "article_content": "Presidential candidates have been confronted by voters over the crisis of opioid abuse and heroin addiction. One major problem is accessing treatment when someone who needs it is ready to receive it.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: People who want help with their drug problems are dying while they're on waitlists for treatment. We've been looking at how campaign issues are affecting people in real life. And today, we want to focus in on one particular challenge - getting help for people struggling with opioid abuse and heroin addiction at the moment they need it. NPR's Tamara Keith is here and has been following both the campaign and the opioid issue. And, Tam, tell us what you found. TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: There is no safe use of heroin. Your next dose could kill you. And again and again, I heard from people that simply there is not enough capacity in treatment programs and that insurance, at times, doesn't cover the treatment that people want or need. SHAPIRO: You spent some time in New Hampshire, and I understand you brought back some personal stories that really reflect on these challenges. KEITH: Yes. First, I want to tell you about Courtney Griffin. She was 20 years old, addicted to heroin, ready to get help. Her mom, Pamela Griffin, thought that she had found that help at an inpatient treatment center about an hour from where they lived. And she told me about that night. PAMELA GRIFFIN: I told Courtney, we have an appointment finally. Pack your bag because you're going. I mean, I thought she was going to be admitted right in there. KEITH: Pamela waited in the lobby while Courtney went in to fill out her paperwork. And about 90 minutes later, she tells me, Courtney was back, shaking her head. Their insurance had been declined. This is the explanation she says they got. P. GRIFFIN: They declined, saying that it wasn't a matter of life and death. And Courtney said, this drug is going to kill me. She knew. She knew. And I sat there and I thought, are you kidding? And it was all about $12,000. They woman said, you know, can you call your dad? $12,000 - we really have the perfect program for you that will help you. We just need the money. SHAPIRO: We're hearing there from Courtney's mother, Pamela. What happened to Courtney? KEITH: She was devastated. They left that facility completely devastated. She got on a wait list for another program, and then her dad, Doug Griffin, says he got a call. DOUG GRIFFIN: When you're a parent of an addict, you're always afraid of the call. You know, you always know that the call is going to come. KEITH: And it did. It was about two months after she had been turned away from that first facility. Courtney was alone and overdosed. SHAPIRO: At age 20. KEITH: At age 20. SHAPIRO: How common is it for people to get turned away because their insurance won't cover the treatment that they say they need? KEITH: There's no good real-time tracking of either treatment availability or statistics about insurance denials. But one recent study found that only about 20 percent of people who have either moderate or severe drug use disorder receive treatment. And if you talk to family members like the Griffins, you hear this constantly. There are just countless completely wrenching stories just like theirs. SHAPIRO: You also said that, even when insurance will cover treatment, there's often not the capacity for the people who need it. How big is that problem? KEITH: One issue is that when people think of treatment, they think of a residential program, 28 days, abstinence, 12 steps. And there simply aren't enough beds available to help all the people that want that kind of treatment, and many folks don't realize that there are other options, like medication-assisted treatment -methadone, other drugs like that. But there aren't enough doctors that do that, so there are waitlists for all kinds of treatment. I want to tell you about another person whose story really brings that home - the issue of these waitlists. His name is Dean Lemire. And in 2012, he had been using heroin for about eighteen months when he decided he just needed to stop. DEAN LEMIRE: The heroin wasn't doing what I wanted it to. And when I wasn't high, I was suicidal. KEITH: So he went to a state-funded treatment center, and he said he was put on a waiting list. LEMIRE: And I had to call every day, three times a day for three weeks. You know, by the end of two and a half weeks, I gave up. SHAPIRO: So what happened? KEITH: He downed a fifth of cheap Canadian whiskey in a plastic bottle and got in his car looking for heroin. LEMIRE: And I got in three car accidents, totaled my car and another, woke up in a jail cell. And when I finally got back home, I called the rehab, and I guess they deemed me serious enough to require their services, so they bumped me up and got me and. SHAPIRO: And was that enough to solve the problem? KEITH: Yes. He's doing really well now. He's in long-term recovery. He's married with a young child. And he's now working as a substance misuse educator at Goodwin Community Health in New Hampshire. He's working to help other people like him. But here's the thing - he says the situation hasn't actually improved. LEMIRE: That wait period has not gotten better. It's actually gotten worse. SHAPIRO: All right, Tam, the problems are really clear. We're calling this series Politics in Real Life, so where does politics come in? What are elected leaders actually doing to fix these problems? KEITH: States are holding special legislative sessions. The U.S. Senate has already passed a bipartisan package of bills to deal with the opioid crisis. And the House this week is taking up 18 different bills related to opioids. SHAPIRO: But when you say related to opioids or to deal with the opioid crisis, is this actually going to get rid of waitlists? Is this actually going to force insurance companies to cover the treatment that, right now, they're not always covering? KEITH: Yes and no. There are bills that would expand treatment options. The CDC just came out with new guidelines for doctors that prescribe opioids to try to reduce abuse. There's a White House task force on insurance coverage. Their results are due in about six months. SHAPIRO: You actually talked to the new White House drug czar about this. KEITH: Indeed. I spoke to him yesterday. His name is Michael Botticelli. His official title - he doesn't really like drug czar - is the director of national drug control policy. MICHAEL BOTTICELLI: It's really tragic that people aren't able to get care and are often dying when they're on waiting lists. You know, every other disease, you get treatment on demand. And that's what we want. KEITH: He's hopeful that the things that are being worked on right now will make a difference. But this is moving in inches, not in miles at this point. SHAPIRO: In that case, it's likely to fall to the next president. And what have the candidates said about this? KEITH: The candidates were surprised. The candidates, when they started going into New Hampshire to campaign because that's what you do when you're running for president, they were hit over the head with this. They encountered family members like Doug Griffin. And even a makeup artist who was doing makeup for the candidates at debates had lost her daughter to an overdose and was talking to them about it. So they were confronted with this issue, and they rapidly started including in their stump speeches mentions of the crisis, talking about friends and family members who they knew who had been affected in some way. SHAPIRO: And it's not a partisan divide. Republicans and Democrats both see this as a problem, and they roughly, more or less, agree on the solutions. KEITH: Broadly - very broadly speaking. Everyone is basically now saying this isn't a war on drugs. This is not a law enforcement issue as much as it is a public health crisis. And that's a huge shift. But in terms of the specifics, Hillary Clinton has come out with a pretty detailed plan. A lot of what she's talking about is now part of what Congress and the White House are doing because there's sort of a limited universe of options. Bernie Sanders has been less specific about what he would do, but his Medicare-for-all plan would, in theory, cover all of this treatment for everyone. Donald Trump does the Trump thing. And he says his wall - his wall along the border - will help keep drugs out of the U.S. SHAPIRO: Prescription painkillers? KEITH: No, just heroin. The prescription painkillers is another thing. But he says he does want to get help for everyone. He doesn't exactly say how. And of course, he has said that he wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act. However, he does say he would replace it with something tremendous. SHAPIRO: That's NPR's Tamara Keith with the latest in our look at politics in real life.

            "article_content": "Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump held no public events Monday, but he nonetheless called into several cable television shows in an effort to clarify statements from last week about how he might negotiate federal deficit payments. His earlier remarks had plenty of economists in an uproar.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: Donald Trump is trying to clarify a remark that caused some angst in financial circles. He first seemed to suggest that the federal government could renegotiate its debt. He has since walked that back. NPR's Scott Horsley reports. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: This is a story about Donald Trump and haircuts, not Trump's own famous do. In this case, haircut is a financial term for the sacrifice a lender agrees to make when a borrower can't repay everything he owes. Trump was on the phone last week with CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" program when co-host Andrew Ross Sorkin posed a provocative question - should the U.S. government demand a haircut from the lenders holding $19 trillion dollars in federal debt? (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"SQUAWK BOX\") ANDREW ROSS SORKIN: (As himself) Do you believe that we - in terms of the United States - need to pay a hundred cents on the dollar or do you think there's actually ways that we could renegotiate that debt? DONALD TRUMP: (As himself) Yeah, I think - look, I've borrowed knowing that you can pay back with discounts, and I've done very well with that. HORSLEY: Trump acknowledged that he built his casino empire with a lot of borrowed money, and he cheerfully referred to himself as the king of debt. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: Now, of course, I was swashbuckling, and it did well for me, and it was good for me and all that. And, you know, debt was sort of always interesting to me. Now we're in a different situation with the country, but I would borrow knowing that if the economy crashed, you could make a deal. HORSLEY: Law professor Lynn LoPucki of UCLA says Trump repeatedly negotiated haircuts on his own company's debts, sometimes with the help of the U.S. bankruptcy code. LYNN LOPUCKI: The Trump casinos have renegotiated debt through bankruptcy four times. In a negotiation, both sides have to agree, so what undoubtedly happened was to the benefit of both the creditors and the Trump casinos. HORSLEY: LoPucki says when a borrower goes bankrupt, lenders have to ask themselves, are we better off negotiating and perhaps settling for a fraction of what we're owed or putting a borrower out of business in which case we might get nothing at all? LOPUCKI: The Trump casinos were simply worth more money with Donald Trump's name on them than without Donald Trump's name on them, and that gave him a lot of leverage. HORSLEY: So could the U.S. government use the same bare-knuckle negotiating tactics with the people to whom it owes money? Most financial experts say, no way. DOUGLAS HOLTZ-EAKIN: Anything less than full and timely repayment on U.S. Treasury is unthinkable. HORSLEY: Douglas Holtz-Eakin is former director of the Congressional Budget Office who now leads the Conservative American Action Forum. He warns if the U.S. government ever pays less than it owes, it'll be slapped with higher borrowing costs in the future. What's more undermining, treasury bills' rock-solid reputation would send shockwaves through the global economy. Trump himself quickly backed away from the idea. He told CNBC last weekend and CNN today he's not suggesting a debt default, but rather a kind of refinancing. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: In other words, if interest rates go up and we can buy bonds back at a discount - if we are liquid enough as a country, we should do that. HORSLEY: It's not clear how that would work, though, since the cash-strapped government would have to borrow more money at rising interest rates to buy back its old debt. Holtz-Eakin was left scratching his head. HOLTZ-EAKIN: This has been an interesting but not particularly illuminating couple of days. The proposals have been essentially all over the map, and they leave me at least wondering what he actually is proposing. HORSLEY: Holtz-Eakin says Trump would be better off focusing on what's behind the government's debt, namely the imbalance between government spending and revenue. So far Trump's offered a tax plan that would reduce revenue by an estimated $9.5 trillion over the next decade. And he's ruled out spending cuts to Medicare and Social Security.

            "article_content": "Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton took definitive steps toward solidifying their respective party's presidential nomination on Tuesday, making their rivals' task to beat them nearly insurmountable. Trump won all five of the delegate-rich GOP primaries in Connecticut, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Delaware and Rhode Island. Clinton notched four victories in Maryland, Delaware, Connecticut and Pennsylvania, while Bernie Sanders won the Rhode Island Democratic primary. In the Republican race, Trump's clean sweep is a major setback for the hopes of the #NeverTrump movement, which had aimed to stop the controversial real estate mogul's march to the GOP nomination. With his wins on Tuesday, Trump has crossed the 900 delegate threshold and will add more as the night goes on. And his victories were decisive, too \u2014 in each state he was winning with at least 57 percent of the vote. Speaking from Trump Tower in New York City, Trump argued that the GOP race was effectively decided. \"I consider myself the presumptive nominee,\" he said. \"As far as I'm concerned, it's over.\" Unlike after last week's New York primary \u2014 when a more restrained, cordial Trump took the stage following his big win \u2014 Trump's speech Tuesday night was in his usual freewheeling, unpredictable style. He reiterated his call for Sanders to run as an independent because he'd been treated unfairly by the Democratic Party \u2014 a schism that would benefit whoever the GOP nominee is. And he took his criticism of Clinton up to a new level, too, telling the crowd that she \"only thing she's got going is the women's card. If Hillary Clinton were a man, I don't think she would get 5 percent of the vote.\" Trump still has a way to go to officially reach the magic 1,237 delegate number before primaries wrap up in June. But his added delegates tonight mean neither Texas Sen. Ted Cruz nor Ohio Gov. John Kasich can get a majority of delegates on the first ballot at the GOP convention. Cruz and Kasich announced an informal alliance of sorts over the weekend, with Kasich ceding Indiana, which votes next Tuesday, to Cruz, while Cruz said he would not campaign in later primaries in New Mexico and Oregon. Trump's big wins Tuesday night make next week's Hoosier State primary even more crucial for Cruz, his next-closest challenger in the delegate count. Speaking from Indiana before polls closed on Tuesday, the Texas senator argued his best states are ahead. \"Tonight, this campaign moves back to favorable terrain; tonight this campaign moves back to Indiana,\" Cruz told the crowd. Kasich long has been mathematically eliminated from winning the 1,237 delegates needed, instead encouraging GOP delegates to flip his way at a contested convention by arguing he is the best general-election candidate. Kasich still has won just one primary \u2014 his home state of Ohio. Short of something extraordinary happening, Clinton will be the Democratic nominee. With four wins on Tuesday, she extended her pledged-delegate lead over Sanders to more than 300. Including superdelegates, the former secretary of state has crossed the 2,000 delegate threshold and is almost 90 percent of the way to the 2,383 delegates needed to secure the nomination. Speaking in Philadelphia \u2014 the same city where the Democratic National Convention will take place in July \u2014 Clinton cast an eye forward to the general election and praised Sanders and Democrats for unifying and agreeing on issues like climate change, LGBT rights and workers' rights. \"With your help we're going to come back to Philadelphia with the most votes and the most pledged delegates,\" she said to cheers. Going into Tuesday, an NPR analysis found that Sanders needed 59 percent of the remaining pledged delegates to erase Clinton's lead. While he did win in Rhode Island, Clinton's big margins in more delegate-rich states \u2014 including Pennsylvania and Maryland \u2014 make is almost mathematically impossible for him to overtake her. In a memo late Tuesday night, the Sanders campaign reiterated his commitment to taking the race all the way to July. \"The people in every state in this country should have the right to determine who they want as president and what the agenda of the Democratic Party should be. That's why we are in this race until the last vote is cast,\" he said in a statement. \"That is why this campaign is going to the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia with as many delegates as possible to fight for a progressive party platform that calls for a $15-an-hour minimum wage, an end to our disastrous trade policies, a Medicare-for-all health care system, breaking up Wall Street financial institutions, ending fracking in our country, making public colleges and universities tuition free and passing a carbon tax so we can effectively address the planetary crisis of climate change.\"",

The top House Republican took aim at the nature of American politics in remarks viewed as a rebuke of GOP presidential front-runner Donald Trump and the tone of his campaign. \"This has always been a tough business, and when passions flare, ugliness is sometimes inevitable. But we shouldn't accept ugliness as the norm,\" House Speaker Paul Ryan said in a speech Wednesday on Capitol Hill. \"Personalities come and go. But principles? Principles endure,\" Ryan added. The Wisconsin representative's address \u2014 hastily announced Tuesday before a two-week Easter break \u2014 comes as Trump and Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, continue to engage in personal insults on the campaign trail. The latest flare-up involves a spat over a Cruz-allied superPAC that used a semi-nude photo of Trump's wife, Melania, in an attack ad aimed at alienating the businessman from Utah's Mormon voters. Trump responded on Twitter with a vague threat to \"spill the beans\" on Cruz's wife, Heidi. In contrast on Wednesday, Ryan said he has made it his \"mission as speaker to raise our gaze and aim for a brighter horizon.\" Ryan has pledged to support Trump if he is the nominee, but he has also publicly rebuked the front-runner on several occasions. Ryan criticized Trump for calling to ban Muslims from entering the U.S., for not more swiftly condemning white supremacists that support his campaign and for not doing more to quell violent outbursts at his campaign events. \"It did not used to be this bad, and it does not have to be this way,\" Ryan said Wednesday. Trump at the top of the ticket has shaken up the political battleground for down-ballot races. Republicans are still favored to maintain House control; however, the nonpartisan Cook Political Report recently shifted 10 House races toward Democrats' favor. Trying to distinguish House Republicans from the politics of the presidential race, Ryan is driving an effort in the House to unveil a policy agenda later this year that will provide a platform for his members to run on in November. As speaker, Ryan will also chair the GOP convention in Cleveland this July. He has said House Republicans' policy efforts could also provide a platform for the eventual GOP nominee. But Trump and Ryan fundamentally differ on policies affecting trade, immigration and entitlements like Medicare and Social Security, and it is unclear how the two could reconcile their ideas to run as a unified party in the general election. The division in the party has led to wild speculation that Ryan, who ran on the 2012 ticket as Mitt Romney's vice president, could somehow exit the convention as the party's nominee if no candidate walks into Cleveland with the nomination locked up. Ryan has laughed off the chatter as ludicrous. \"As the chair of the convention, I'm going to be dispassionate,\" he told reporters Tuesday. \"Rules are rules. We're going to stick with the rules.\"",

Marco Rubio, R-Fla., left, Donald Trump, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and Ohio Gov. John Kasich, right, stand together during the signing of the National Anthem, before the start of the Republican presidential debate Thursday in Miami. This story is part of NPR's fact-checking series, Break it Down. Florida, which holds its presidential primary on Tuesday, is home to more than 3 million seniors who rely on Social Security. At the GOP debate in Miami Thursday night, candidates were asked about their plans for the program. All the Republican candidates say they want to leave Social Security as it is for people who are already retired, or soon will be. But Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz have proposed changes for younger workers. Donald Trump says he wants to preserve Social Security benefits and is counting on stronger economic growth to help pay for that. Dana Bash, CNN: \"According to the Social Security Administration, unless adjustments are made, Social Security is projected to run out of money within 20 years.\" Marco Rubio: \"Anyone who tells you Social Security can stay the way it is is lying. Any politician that goes around saying, 'We don't have to do anything; all we have to do is raise a few taxes or just leave it the way it is,' they're not being honest with you. Social Security will go bankrupt and it will bankrupt the country with it. So what it will require is people younger, like myself, people that are 30 years away from retirement, to accept that our Social Security is going to work differently than it did for my parents. For example, instead of retiring at 67 the way I'm supposed to retire, I'd have to retire at 68....If I've made a lot of money, my Social Security benefit will not grow a fast as someone who made less money.\" Ted Cruz: \"Social Security right now is careening towards insolvency, and it's irresponsible.....For younger workers, we need to change the rate of growth of benefits so it matches inflation instead of exceeding inflation. And as you noted Dana, we need to have for younger workers that a portion of your tax payments are in personal accounts like the 401(k) that you own, that you control, that you can pass on to your kids and grandkids.\" John Kasich: \"If you've had wealth throughout your lifetime, when the time comes to be on Social Security, you'll still get it. It will simply be less. And for those people who depend on that Social Security, they'll get their full benefit.\" Donald Trump: \"I will do everything in my power not to touch Social Security....I want to make our country rich again so we can afford it.\" 1. How big is the hole in the Social Security safety net? 2. What would it take to fix it? 1. The question from CNN somewhat overstates the problem. Social Security won't \"run out of money\" in 20 years. What will happen \u2014 somewhere around 2035 \u2014 is the program will exhaust its \"Trust Fund,\" which Social Security uses to help supplement money from payroll taxes. Even after the trust fund is gone, payroll taxes paid by workers will continue to flow into the system, and those funds will be sufficient to cover about three-quarters of all retirement benefits. In other words, if nothing is done, future retirees could still expect to collect 75 cents for every dollar of Social Security they're owed. (Social Security has a separate program that pays disability benefits, and it faces a more urgent cash crunch. If money from the retirement program is diverted to back fill the disability program, the trust fund will be exhausted a few years earlier.) 2. There are a number of ways to close the gap between the money Social Security expects to take in from payroll taxes (the sole source of revenue once the trust fund is exhausted) and what it's expected to pay out in retirement benefits. All of the fixes involve some combination of raising revenue and/or cutting benefits. If policy makers act now, the gap could be closed with relatively modest changes. The longer we wait, the larger the required changes will have to be. Some of the fixes proposed by the GOP candidates would help to narrow the gap, but none would close it altogether. The basic challenge facing Social Security is demographic. The system relies on payroll taxes from people who are working to pay benefits to those who are retired. That worked well when there were four or five workers for every retiree. But that ratio has now dropped below three workers per retiree and it's drifting towards two. Absent another baby boom or a massive influx of immigrants, that's not likely to change. If policy makers take no action, there will still be money coming in to Social Security from payroll taxes. It just won't be enough to cover all the benefits that retirees will be owed. (It will be enough to pay about 75 cents on the dollar.) Closing that gap will require cutting benefits, raising taxes, or some combination of the two. Rubio's proposal: Marco Rubio suggests gradually raising the retirement age at which younger workers like himself become eligible for Social Security. This is effectively a cut in benefits, since retirees would have fewer years to collect. Raising the top retirement age from 67 to 70 as Rubio proposed would fill about one-third of the Social Security shortfall. Rubio also suggested a form of \"means testing,\" in which wealthier retirees would see smaller benefit increases in the future. The Senator didn't offer any details, but other means testing proposals have been estimated to reduce the funding shortfall by about 10 percent. Cruz's proposal: Ted Cruz suggests a different form of benefit cut, in which future retirees would receive smaller cost-of-living adjustments. Some argue that the current inflation measure used by Social Security overstates the price increases seniors face, although others insist cost of living adjustments should be bigger, not smaller. The cut that Cruz suggests would fix about 15 percent of the funding shortfall. Cruz also proposes letting workers divert a portion of their payroll taxes into private retirement accounts. This may or may not be a good idea. It was hotly debated during the George W. Bush administration. But using payroll taxes for any purpose other than Social Security would make the system's solvency problems worse, not better. Kasich's proposal: John Kasich also advocates means testing with reduced benefits for wealthy seniors. Trump's proposal: Donald Trump argues against any cut in benefits or increase in taxes, instead relying on faster economic growth to close the Social Security funding gap. Kathleen Romig of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities says faster growth would help with this and many other challenges. But she warns it's not a \"magic bullet.\" Forecasters have tried to predict Social Security's fate under many different economic scenarios, and there's no realistic growth level that would close the funding gap on its own. Faster growth cuts both ways, increasing revenue from payroll taxes but also increasing benefits, which are tied to wages. Revenue proposals: None of the Republicans suggested raising payroll taxes, but that's another way policymakers could help to close the funding gap. Payroll taxes for Social Security are currently 12.4 percent, split between employers and employees. Raising that rate to about 15 percent would close the funding gap entirely. (There's a separate, 2.9 percent payroll tax for Medicare.) Alternatively, policymakers could apply the payroll tax to more income. Wages and salaries above $117,000 a year are currently exempt from Social Security taxes. If that cap were eliminated, it would solve about 90 percent of the funding gap. Any of these fixes can be thought of as items on a menu, to be mixed, matched, and combined in whatever way is most politically palatable. By acting now, policymakers could solve the Social Security gap with a relatively modest increase in taxes and modest adjustments to benefits. With each passing year of inaction, though, the gap to be filled gets larger.",

Bernie Sanders, a 2016 Democratic presidential candidate, has proposed a health care policy he calls \"Medicare for All.\" But some left-leaning economists say the plan doesn't pencil out.\n                \n                    \n                    Bloomberg/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Sen. Bernie Sanders, a 2016 Democratic presidential candidate, has proposed a health care policy he calls \"Medicare for All.\" But some left-leaning economists say the plan doesn't pencil out. When Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders stumps for health care for everyone, it always gets huge applause. \"I believe that the U.S. should do what every other major country on Earth is doing,\" he told a crowd at Eastern Michigan University on Feb. 15. \"And that is, guarantee health care to all people as a right.\" The Democratic presidential hopeful basically wants to nationalize the U.S. health insurance industry, and have Uncle Sam foot the bill for medical bills, office visits and prescriptions. Get rid of copays. Get rid of deductibles. Get rid of lots of forms. The voters love it. But the proposal has ignited a lively debate among left-leaning economists and policy analysts, and some are challenging his numbers. \"I like the goal of the plan,\" Jared Bernstein, formerly a top economic adviser to Vice President Biden, tells Shots. \"I'm not sure the numbers add up, but the aspirations add up.\" Though Sanders calls his plan Medicare for All, the system he proposes would be far more generous than the current health care program for senior citizens. It would cover more, and beneficiaries would pay far less out of pocket. Sanders says he can pay for it \u2014 by raising people's federal income tax by 2.2 percent and charging employers 6.2 percent of their payroll. The typical family would pay $466 more in premiums and save more than $5,000 in health care costs each year, according to the outline of the plan on his website. To back it up, he cites an analysis titled \"United States Can Afford Single Payer Health Care Program\" from Gerald Friedman, an economics professor at the University of Massachusetts. Longtime backers of single-payer health plans are circling Sanders to promote his proposal. His campaign office is circulating a statement signed by more than 130 economists, physicians and university professors endorsing the plan. \"The medical insurance industry is really a group of middlemen \u2014 there's no need to have middlemen between paying for care and actually receiving care,\" says Dr. Steffie Woolhandler, an internist and professor at the City University of New York's school of public health at Hunter College. Woolhandler signed the letter and has written several editorials defending Sanders' ideas. She says such systems operate around the world, and many countries spend as much as 40 percent less per capita than the U.S. spends on health care. Many liberal economists and policymakers, however, disagree with the practicality of the plan, and are challenging Sanders' math regarding the cost and savings. \"The government would make public something like 8 to 9 percent of the economy that's currently private,\" says Bernstein, who is now a fellow at the nonpartisan Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. \"That would be hugely disruptive to those on that private side.\" And Kenneth Thorpe, chairman of the health policy and management program at Emory University's school of public health, estimates that Sanders' plan will cost twice as much as the senator claims. \"A single payer plan would create enormous financial winners and losers among households and businesses,\" Thorpe writes in a recent analysis. Economist Henry Aaron of the Brookings Institution called the Sanders plan an impossible pipe dream in a widely reprinted story published last month. And four former White House economic advisers wrote an open letter to Sanders and Friedman describing the economic claims underpinning Sanders' proposal as \"extreme.\" \"As much as we wish it were so, no credible economic research supports economic impacts of these magnitudes,\" wrote the economists \u2014 all former chairs of the White House Council of Economic Advisers. One of the letter's authors, Austan Goolsbee, of the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, was chairman of President Obama's council of economic advisers. He says Sanders overestimates the savings from the single-payer program and underestimates the costs and necessary tax increases. \"If you promise, 'I'm going to take you to the finest French restaurant and give you Chateaubriand and it's only going to cost you $2.79,' it's right to be a little skeptical and say, 'How do I know you're not going to just give me a Wendy's spicy chicken wrap and call it a day?' \" Goolsbee tells Shots. Goolsbee and other skeptics admit they don't relish opening another gigantic fight over health care just a few years after Obama's Affordable Care Act was signed into law. \"I was there when we were doing Obamacare, and that was a really hard job,\" he says. \"The thought of re-fighting that battle? That does make me nervous.\" The Sanders campaign has dismissed such critics as \"establishment voices\" that just don't want to disrupt the status quo.",

            "article_content": "Democratic presidential candidates Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton debate in Milwaukee Thursday night. It's the first chance for voters to see them since Sanders' big win in New Hampshire.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: Tonight in Milwaukee, Democratic presidential candidates Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton will meet face-to-face for the first time since the Hampshire primary where Sanders thumped Clinton, winning by more than 20 percentage points. NPR's Tamara Keith is at the debate site in Milwaukee and joins us with this preview. Hey, Tam. TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Hey, Ari. SHAPIRO: The Clinton campaign has been pretty clear that they do not think Senator Sanders' record has been adequately scrutinized. What do you expect Secretary Clinton to do with that in the debate tonight? KEITH: Well, Clinton needs to slow Bernie Sanders' momentum, which he has a lot of right now. And as you say, the campaign feels like he really hasn't been pressed on his views on national security or how his Medicare for All plan would actually work. And so you can expect Clinton to draw contrasts with Sanders as she has in past debates on things like that. But as Hillary Clinton said in her concession speech on Tuesday night, she also has to work on her own message - the way she talks to young people, in particular. And so while drawing this - these contrasts, she also needs to find a way to deliver a more inspirational message, and this is her first chance since that drubbing in New Hampshire for her to do that on a national stage. SHAPIRO: Another part of the work she needs to do was apparent in the exit polls, which showed that Sanders won overwhelmingly among Democrats who said being honest and trustworthy was a top priority. How does Sanders keep capitalizing on that in the face-to-face conversation tonight? KEITH: He is likely not to want to talk about her damned emails, as he said in a past debate, but he will absolutely, unless something dramatic changes, talk about Wall Street and corporate influence and money in politics. This is something that he's talked about in past debates, and it's been a very effective line of attack against Clinton. It's definitely hurt her. In conversations that I've had with voters at both Clinton and Sanders events, they say that her ties, her campaign contributions from corporate interests are a big concern, and I think that has been part of that honest and trustworthy issue. SHAPIRO: Now, the next two states to vote, Nevada and South Carolina, have much more diverse electorates than Iowa and New Hampshire. We have seen both candidates piling up endorsements from African-American prominent folks and having surrogates on the campaign trail. How do you expect their message to reflect that tonight at the debate? KEITH: You can definitely expect to see them talk, I think, in more depth about things like water crisis in Flint, criminal justice reform, voting rights, immigration reform. And as you mentioned with these endorsements, just today, here's a sign of how important these candidates feel African-American voters are. Bernie Sanders was out with a web video with Harry Belafonte endorsing him, and the Congressional Black Caucus Political Action Committee had a press conference where people like civil rights leader and congressman John Lewis praised Clinton and took a swipe at Sanders' civil rights credentials. SHAPIRO: Have the debates actually mattered that much in the Democratic race until now? We've heard so much about the Republican debates. Have these made a difference? KEITH: There have been no real game-changing moments in the Democratic debates thus far, nothing as dramatic as what happened with Marco Rubio in New Hampshire in last weekend's Republican debate. But debates are really an opportunity for candidates to be pushed, to take strong, firm positions on things. And those positions that these candidates could take in tonight's debate could potentially become problematic in a general election. The positions that you take in a primary don't necessarily play as well in a general election audience, and any debate is an opportunity for something like that to happen. SHAPIRO: That's NPR's Tamara Keith. Thanks, Tam. KEITH: You're welcome, Ari. Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "Democratic presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders has revived the debate over a single-payer health care system. NPR explores the arguments for and against it.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: Part of that revolution is the idea that the government should provide health insurance for everyone. The so-called single-payer model is used in other countries like Canada and South Korea. But policy makers in this country have never given it a serious look. NPR's Scott Horsley looks at why. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Bernie Sanders make a simple argument for overhauling the health care system. The United States spends more than twice as much as other countries do on health care, but Americans aren't any healthier. And tens of millions of people here have no health insurance. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BERNIE SANDERS: Our vision must be to guarantee health care to all people in a cost-effective way. And that, to me, means a Medicare-for-all single-payer program. HORSLEY: Advocates claim a single-payer system would do a couple of things to lower the cost of health care. With just one bill-payer covering everyone, it would dramatically streamline paperwork. Gerard Anderson of Johns Hopkins says health care administrative costs here are two to three times what they are elsewhere. GERARD ANDERSON: We're paying quite a high amount for having a lot of choice among different health insurance systems. So Americans like choice; we just have to pay for it. HORSLEY: Needless paperwork is only part of what's keeping health costs high. Anderson says the most important factor in America's costly medical bill is prices. ANDERSON: If you got to the hospital, you're going to pay a lot more. You go to a doctor, you're going to pay a lot more. You buy a prescription drug, you're going to pay a lot more. And it's because we don't have anybody negotiating the prices as one entity as they do in Canada or they do in the U.K. HORSLEY: Backers say a single payer would have the bargaining power needed to force doctors, hospitals and drugs companies to accept lower prices. Advocates tried to make that case in the early days of the Obama administration, though single-payer was never really part of the conversation. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: My question is, why have they taken single-payer off the plate? (APPLAUSE) BARACK OBAMA: We got the little single-payer advocates up here. HORSLEY: President Obama told this town hall audience back in 2009 single-payer might make sense if the U.S. were starting from scratch, but it's not. Obama was leery of causing too much disruption to one-sixth of the U.S. economy, and Hillary Clinton makes much the same argument today. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) HILLARY CLINTON: I'm not interested in ideas that sound good on paper but will never make it in the real world. HORSLEY: Harold Pollack of the University of Chicago says, while it's easy to imagine an idealized single-payer system, it's harder to sketch out the roadmap that would take the U.S. from here to there. HAROLD POLLACK: You cannot close down the American health care system on a Friday and say we're going to open it on Monday as a single-payer system. HORSLEY: Ongoing opposition to the Affordable Care Act shows just how resistant Americans are to tinkering with their health care. What's more, Anderson says, the government doesn't have a great track record of pushing cost containment. ANDERSON: Any time we've tried to negotiate prices, what you basically see is, oh, we want to negotiate with hospitals, except for that one hospital in my district that really deserves the money. HORSLEY: Multiply that by 535 lawmakers and a powerful army of lobbyists. There are a lot of jobs riding on our $3 trillion health care system, and Pollack says the doctors, insurers and drug companies aren't likely to take a pay cut quietly. POLLACK: That's going to be a knife fight. That doesn't mean that we shouldn't do that, but it's a very, very big challenge. HORSLEY: Even so, Pollack sees the argument over single-payer as a healthy debate, one we didn't have back in 2009. Former Sen. Max Baucus says, in hindsight, Democrats might have been wise to keep single-payer on the table, if only as a bargaining chip. It would have made Obama's push for a public insurance option look moderate by comparison. Scott Horsley, NPR News, Washington. Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Hillary Clinton encountered rougher seas Sunday night in her latest meeting with her rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination. Both Sen. Bernard Sanders and former Gov. Martin O'Malley questioned her veracity and intensified their criticism of her policy positions and campaign financing. This was the last time these candidates will debate before the Iowa caucuses on Feb. 1. But the mood of this meeting was more portentous than those of their previous three debates, if only because Iowa no longer looks like an easy win for Clinton. She has seen almost all her polling advantage vanish in that state. She also continues to trail in polls in New Hampshire, which will hold a primary on Feb. 9. The Sunday night debate was held in Charleston, S.C., which will hold its Democratic primary on Feb. 27. The event was co-sponsored by NBC, YouTube and the Congressional Black Caucus Institute. O'Malley was included despite his rather humble standing in national polling (an average of roughly 2 percent support among Democrats) because he did reach the 5 percent in Iowa. By the rules for inclusion, that was sufficient. All three candidates paid tribute to the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday by citing King's influence on their lives. Issues of specific interest to African-Americans surfaced often through the nearly two-hour event. All three candidates talked of inequities in the criminal justice system affecting black men in particular. Sanders generally agreed on these points and also said any death in police custody should automatically trigger an investigation by the Justice Department. Asked why he was trailing Clinton by more than 2-1 among black Democrats, Sanders replied with a recitation of how well he was doing in other polls and how far he had come. African-Americans, he said, would come along once they got to know him and his issues. Among those issues was his repeated critique of Wall Street banks and of the campaign finance system, which he said perpetuated income inequality and other distortions of the nation's economic life. \"When the African-American community becomes familiar with my congressional record,\" said Sanders, \"and with our agenda, and with our views on the economy, and criminal justice \u2014 just as the general population has become more supportive, so will the African-American community, so will the Latino community.\" Clinton, when asked what issue she wanted to talk about but had not been asked about, cited the lead poisoning crisis in Flint, Mich., an older industrial city with a largely African-American population. A recent decision to use river water there has led to widespread lead poisoning, including nearly all the city's younger children. Sanders began the debate on the defensive regarding his past stands on gun rights and immunity for gun makers. \"He voted for immunity from gun makers and sellers which the NRA said was the most important piece of gun legislation in 20 years,\" said Clinton. \"He voted to let guns go onto Amtrak, guns go into national parks. He voted against doing research to figure out how we can save lives.\" Said Sanders in reply, \"I think Secretary Clinton knows that what she says is very disingenuous,\" adding that he only had \"a D-minus rating from the NRA\" so he couldn't be that good a friend. Sanders then took the fight to Clinton on a number of other issues \u2014 especially the regulation of Wall Street, her ties to Wall Street banks, including $600,000 in speaking fees from Goldman Sachs. Clinton at several points defended her stands by linking them to President Obama's \u2014 an ironic tactic given her bitter fight with him over the 2008 nomination. \"The comments that Sen. Sanders has made,\" said Clinton, \"[they] don't just affect me, I can take that, but he's criticized President Obama for taking donations from Wall Street, and President Obama has led our country out of the Great Recession.\" And she did not leave it there. \"Sen. Sanders called [Obama] weak, disappointing,\" Clinton said. \"He even, in 2011, publicly sought someone to run in a primary against President Obama.\" She highlighted her work with Obama on foreign policy as his secretary of state (2009-2013) and argued for maintaining and defending Obamacare rather than reaching for a Sanders-style revision of the system that she said would \"force the country back into another contentious debate.\" Sanders said he would be replacing existing government programs and private insurance with what Franklin D. Roosevelt had wanted: \"health care for every man, woman and child as a right.\" To finance the government as the new \"single payer\" for health care, Sanders would raise taxes substantially on higher incomes in the U.S., imposing rates of over 50 percent on the incomes of the wealthiest. Capital gains would also be taxed at the same rate as wages and other forms of income. The payroll tax that now covers Social Security and Medicare would also be enlarged and extended to more income that is currently exempt, were Sanders to prevail. \"It's one thing to say I'm raising taxes,\" said Sanders. \"It's another thing to say that we are doing away with private health insurance premiums. So if I save you $10,000 in private health insurance and you pay a little bit more in taxes in total, there are huge savings in what your family is spending.\" Foreign affairs came up at several points but did not dominate the evening as in some of the Republican debates. The candidates noted that several individuals with dual American-Iranian citizenship who faced prison terms in Iran had been released over the weekend after 14 months of negotiations between the two countries. The U.S. has also just lifted sanctions on that country pursuant to the larger agreement negotiated and completed in 2015. Those arrangements, and the easing of legal cases brought by the Justice Department against several Iranians, had been roundly criticized by several Republican candidates for president on Sunday. Clinton in particular praised her successor, Secretary of State John Kerry, for his efforts to free Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian and the other detainees and for negotiating the recent nuclear agreement with Tehran. Much of the social media attention paid to the debate focused on the more aggressive tone and approach taken by all three contestants. Sanders had been urged to drive home his contrasts with Clinton to close the sale in Iowa and New Hampshire. He was expected to do that in part because the Clinton campaign had sharpened its own attacks on him in recent days. Chelsea Clinton had accused him of trying to \"dismantle\" the existing health care system, and a superPAC run by a Clinton ally had run an ad asking whether Sanders, now 74, is healthy and vigorous enough to serve four or eight years in the Oval Office. The heightened tension also reflected the relatively unsettled state of the race. After months of seeming the clear favorite and likely nominee, Clinton has seen her national approval ratings fall in the past month. And while Sanders has not risen to a corresponding degree in national polls, he has improved his standing in both Iowa and New Hampshire. A resident of Vermont for nearly half a century, Sanders has always had a certain appeal to Democrats, especially the more liberal ones, in neighboring New Hampshire. But his ascent in Iowa, where he began with far less name recognition, has raised eyebrows throughout the political world. It was in Iowa that Barack Obama began his string of upset victories over Clinton in 2008, when she had once been thought nearly as inevitable as she seemed last fall. Hillary Clinton maintains leads in some national polls of Democrats and those who lean toward the Democrats. The latest reading by the respected tandem of NBC and The Wall Street Journal most recently found her ahead of Sanders by 25 points countrywide. But last week a CBS News/New York Times poll had her national edge at just 7 points. All agree that in Iowa and New Hampshire the race is too close to call. Clinton has a lead of four points when all Iowa polls are averaged, while Sanders has a six-point advantage by the same measure in New Hampshire. Sanders found a moment to crow about this: \"As Secretary Clinton well knows, when this campaign began she was 50 points ahead of me. We were all of three percentage points. Guess what? In Iowa, New Hampshire, the race is very, very close. Maybe we're ahead [in] New Hampshire.\" Clinton seems comfortably ahead in the next two states that also test party sentiment in February \u2014 Nevada and South Carolina. But such leads have melted away in the past when a frontrunner has failed to win in Iowa or New Hampshire. In 2008, the last time the Democrats had a contested nomination, Clinton saw her early polling dominance challenged when Obama, then a senator from Illinois, gained a solid win in Iowa. Even though Clinton recovered to win in New Hampshire the following week, her support declined in South Carolina and Nevada. This enabled Obama to gain the upper hand, fight her to a draw on the big primary day (Super Tuesday) and then outlast her through the spring. Could that happen to Clinton again this year? It seems less likely, as Sanders lacks Obama's natural advantage among African-Americans and other minority voters in South Carolina and elsewhere. So even if he wins both Iowa and New Hampshire, he might still struggle in the later February states. Thereafter, as the contest move to other Southern states on March 1, black voters will continue to represent a larger portion of the Democratic turnout. O'Malley could also be a factor in the Iowa contest, which is conducted as an open caucus at the precinct level. At these events, caucus participants hold a preliminary vote, and candidates whose support falls short of a viability threshold are dropped. Their supporters are then free to support others in the final vote. So in those precincts where O'Malley has backers, but not enough to qualify for the final vote, the second-choice preference of those backers could prove critically important. A similar dynamic has made a difference to the outcome in the Iowa caucuses in some recent cycles \u2014 notably 1984, 1988, 2000, 2004 and 2008.",

            "article_content": "A feisty Bernie Sanders defended his positions on gun control and his newly released health care plan in Sunday night's Democratic presidential debate. Just two weeks before the Iowa caucuses, the NBC News debate had a new urgency, with the Vermont senator closing the gap with Hillary Clinton in Iowa and New Hampshire. The two had mostly held their punches in their previous meetings, but much of their differences were laid bare during the face-off in Charleston, S.C. \"He has voted with the NRA and the gun lobby numerous times,\" Clinton charged, citing Sanders's past support for the Brady Bill, immunity for gun manufacturers and for the \"Charleston loophole\" that allowed Dylann Roof to allegedly get a gun to kill nine African-American churchgoers down the street at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church last June. Sanders announced Saturday evening he would now back a bill in Congress that would repeal that immunity for manufacturers, but Clinton argued it wasn't enough. \"There's no other industry in America that was given a total pass,\" Clinton said. Sanders argued that his opponent's argument was \"disingenuous,\" pointing to his D- rating from the NRA, and said all along he had said he would \"re-look\" at the issue. Former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, still struggling to get momentum in the race and to jump into the skirmishes between the two frontrunners, argued he was the only one who had been consistent. \"I've never met a self-respecting hunter that needed an AR-15 to down a deer,\" O'Malley said. Another flashpoint between Sanders and Clinton was on health care. Just two hours before Sunday's debate, the progressive favorite released his \"Medicare-for-all\" plan. The universal health care proposal \u2014 which would have no co-pays or deductibles for patients \u2014 would be paid for with a new 2.2 percent health care premium, a 6.2 percent health care payroll tax paid for by employers, and an estate tax. It would also be funded by a change in federal tax brackets \u2014 individuals making $250,000 to $500,000 a year would be taxed at a rate of 37 percent. Those earning $10 million or more a year would be taxed at 52 percent \u2014 but would only include about 13,000 households in the U.S. Clinton attacked the plan though, saying it would \"tear up\" everything President Obama had accomplished with the Affordable Care Act, which should instead be improved upon. \"We finally have a path to universal health care. We have accomplished so much already. I do not want to see the Republicans repeal it and I do not want to start over again with another contentious debate,\" Clinton said. Sanders shot back that her fears were \"nonsense\" and that something had to be done about the 29 million people who still did not have health care. He blamed big money and lobbyists for blocking bigger reforms, saying blocking money in politics would help fix the problem. \"A little more in taxes, do away with private insurance premiums, it's a pretty good deal,\" Sanders argued, saying he didn't want to do away with the president's health care plan he had helped write. Clinton shot back that Sanders has been inconsistent on what he wants though, asking if he supported \"the plan you just introduced tonight or the plan you introduced nine times in the Congress.\" In a city and a state that's faced recent racial strife \u2014 from the Charleston shooting to the killing of Walter Scott, an unarmed black man who was shot by a police officer \u2014 all the candidates also tackled the issues of policing and racial justice. The debate was hosted by the Congressional Black Caucus and came on the eve of Martin Luther King Day. O'Malley defended his record as mayor of Baltimore, which has come under scrutiny in the wake of the death of Freddie Gray while in police custody last year. Sanders said any death in police custody should automatically trigger a federal investigation. \"If a police officer breaks the law, like any public official, that person must be held accountable,\" he proposed. But Sanders is losing African-American voters by a large margin, according to polls \u2014 one big reason he's trailing Clinton in South Carolina where black voters dominate the primary. When pressed by moderator Lester Holt on his weakness, Sanders demurred, pointing to how far he had come from when he first entered the race. \"When the African-American community becomes familiar with my congressional record and with our agenda and with our views on the economy and criminal justice, just as the general population has become more supportive, so will the African-American community, so will the Latino community,\" Sanders said. One demographic Sanders does have a commanding lead with is younger voters. In response to a YouTube question about how she'd work to win over millennials, Clinton pointed to her work on women's issues and civil rights. But she also seemed to tacitly acknowledge her opponent's strength with that bloc, saying she \"respected\" his support there. Sanders frequently returned to one of his most salient attacks against Clinton \u2014 that she's too cozy with big businesses and Wall Street. \"I don't take money from the banks. I don't take personal speaking fees from Goldman Sachs,\" Sanders said, slamming Clinton for the $600,000 she took from the private corporate equity firm. Clinton jabbed back that there's \"no daylight\" between herself and Sanders on financial reform and took issue with Sanders criticizing the president's leadership on banking reform. \"I'm going to defend Dodd-Frank and I'm going to defend President Obama,\" Clinton said. While the first hour of the debate focused on domestic policy, the trio of Democrats did tackle foreign policy in the second half \u2014 a stark departure from Republican debates, where national security has dominated. All three Democrats said they supported how Obama was handling tensions with Syria and the rise of ISIS in the region but none said they supported sending U.S. ground forces to assist. Sanders echoed calls to bring more allies into the fight against the terrorist organization. \"They have got to start putting some skin in the game, and not just ask the United States to do it,\" he said. Sanders also said he was open to a \"warm up\" of relations with Iran as the U.S. did with Cuba this year, but cautioned against moving too quickly. \"Can I tell that we should open an embassy in Tehran tomorrow? No, I don't think we should,\" he said. \"But I think the goal has go to be as we've done with Cuba, to move in warm relations with a very powerful and important country in this world.\" Clinton also pointed to her experience as secretary of state, saying she was \"proud\" of the Iran nuclear agreement\" and \"was responsible for getting those sanctions imposed.\" She also did little to distance herself from the president, even as Republicans have argued a Clinton presidency would be the same as a third term for Obama. \"I know a little bit about this,\" she said when talking about Obama's Syria policy, \"having spent many hours in the situation room, advising President Obama.\"",

            "article_content": "As voting nears and polls suggest a tightening race, the leaders for the Democratic presidential nomination are sharpening their focus on one another.  KELLY MCEVERS, HOST: On the Democratic side, the nice, polite race for the presidential nomination changed this week into more of a battle. NPR's Tamara Keith reports that with voting just over two weeks away, the frontrunners - Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton - are making what you might call their closing arguments. TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: In television interviews and press releases, tweets and hastily arranged conference calls, the campaigns of Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders are doing battle over policy with a hint of something more fundamental about who the candidates are and what they stand for. Take this ad released today by Bernie Sanders contrasting himself with Hillary Clinton on Wall Street reform. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BERNIE SANDERS: There are two Democratic visions for regulating Wall Street. One says it's OK to take millions from big banks and then tell them what to do. My plan - break up the big banks. KEITH: This follows a newly sharpened stump speech and a whole series of ads from Hillary Clinton this week. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) HILLARY CLINTON: It's time to pick a side. Either we stand with the gun lobby, or we join the president and stand up to them. KEITH: In addition to guns, Clinton and her surrogates are also going after Sanders on taxes and how he'd pay for his Medicare For All plan. This, as a Des Moines Register Bloomberg Iowa poll out today, shows Clinton up in Iowa by only two pints, a major erosion of her lead in just a month. Meanwhile, in New Hampshire, Sanders is pulling firmly ahead. At the Brown and Black Forum on Fusion Television on Monday, Sanders told moderator Jorge Ramos, this may well explain a change in the intensity of the rhetoric. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JORGE RAMOS: Have you noticed lately that she's been getting more aggressive with you? SANDERS: Yes. RAMOS: Why is that? (LAUGHTER) SANDERS: I don't know. It could be... RAMOS: You tell me. SANDERS: It could be that the inevitable candidate for the Democratic nomination may not be so inevitable today. KEITH: And maybe it was inevitable that these two candidates would start calling each other out by name in political speeches, attacking each other's policy positions and making sure voters know their differences. As Clinton put it in a speech on Tuesday... (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CLINTON: We're getting into that period before the caucus that I kind of call the let's-get-real period. KEITH: Clinton's closing argument is a combination of electability, continuing President Obama's legacy and job readiness. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CLINTON: This is a very consequential caucus because it will set the tone for whether or not we're going to be able to hold onto the White House, build on the progress we've made or watch it get ripped away. KEITH: For Sanders, the argument is, why settle for the Washington establishment and policy proposals that only go halfway? Join the political revolution, and Bernie Sanders really can win. His campaign manager, Jeff Weaver... JEFF WEAVER: It's a false case that she's the most electable candidate in the general election. Polls are coming out which show the exact opposite. He did far better against every Republican, right? And in some cases, he was winning against Republicans against whom she was losing. KEITH: But there are risks in the new tone the campaign has taken on, especially for Sanders, says Bill Burton, who worked on President Obama's campaign in 2008 and is now a Democratic consultant at SKDKnickerbocker. BILL BURTON: I mean, they made such a big deal out of how they weren't going to attack Hillary Clinton at the beginning of this campaign. So to get to the end and see that the finish line is in sight and suddenly lose sight of that principle - it's not great for the brand. KEITH: Clinton's brand, for better or for worse, he says, is that of a political creature not afraid to scrap with an opponent, and that's exactly what she's doing now. Tamara Keith, NPR News.
