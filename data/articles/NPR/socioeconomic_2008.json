Female voters from all socioeconomic backgrounds are expected to play a big role in the Pennsylvania primary on Tuesday. While both blue-collar and professional women have supported New York Sen. Hillary Clinton in past contests, polls show that Illinois Sen. Barack Obama is starting to make inroads with this voting group. But many of these women expressed frustration with the tone of the debate and the way the moderators rehashed what they saw as minor points from the campaign trail. Instead, the women said, they would have preferred to hear more substance from the candidates. \"It just seemed like at the beginning, it was not a debate,\" said Shauna Ponton, who works as a child advocate at a nonprofit. \"It was a 'bash Obama' campaign, and I think all of that was seriously unnecessary. I would have liked to have heard more about the key issues: gas, taxes, housing crisis \u2014 all of that.\" Many of these women describe themselves as living paycheck to paycheck. Lawrenceville has a history as a blue-collar community, where generations of steelworkers lived. Now, many of the steelworkers' children remain in the community, along with Pittsburgh commuters lured by the lower rents. Bonnie Bridge is a Lawrenceville native who handles the payroll for an education company. \"Once they started getting into actual issues, versus what I'm going to call 'gently mudslinging' at each other and things like that, I liked the end of it a lot better than the beginning,\" she said. After the debate, Bridge said she was leaning toward Clinton because she liked Clinton's confidence and the way she marshaled facts. Annie Burke, a public school teacher, had a different reaction to the candidates and thought Obama held up well when Clinton talked about his pastor or about his comment about \"bitter\" people in little towns. \"At first, I thought, 'Why are we rehashing these comments that have been made?' But it gives him the opportunity to show how he handles these situations,\" she said. \"Often, he comes out stronger even than he was before. He really has been able to refine some of his answers to these controversies.\" Once the candidates did begin addressing the issues, voter Betsy Coleman said she was glad to hear them outline their policies for bringing troops home from Iraq. \"I would wonder if you could make a blanket statement that you would definitely do it within 60 days, but I liked the idea that they were going to try to do it that way,\" she said about the candidates' troop-withdrawal plans. All the Lawrenceville women were impressed with both candidates' command of the issues. Though few minds in this particular group of women were really changed by the debate, all seemed eager to see a Democrat win the general election.",

While Illinois Sen. Barack Obama and New York Sen. Hillary Clinton are still fighting a state-by-state battle for the Democratic nomination, McCain told attendees at a town hall meeting at Youngstown State University that he has the freedom to look ahead to the November election and to court voters in swing states such as Ohio. \"It's a big news day in politics, with the Pennsylvania primary and all,\" McCain said. \" And I've been left recently in the unfamiliar position of facing no opposition within my own party,\" McCain locked up the Republican nomination in March, after a remarkable comeback. \"It was a different story last year,\" he said. \"I could claim the unqualified support of [his wife] Cindy and my mother \u2014 and Mom was starting to keep her options open.\" The Arizona senator suggested that Youngstown and other financially distressed parts of the country are due for a similar comeback, which he promised to fuel with \"pro-growth policies,\" including sizable tax cuts. McCain promises to balance those tax cuts with deep cuts in government spending. Independent observers are skeptical and warn the tax cuts are likely to widen the federal deficit. McCain also stressed the need for better job training to help displaced workers adapt to a changing economy. \"Our workers will be given options, and training relevant to need, and at every turn treated with the respect and consideration they deserve,\" he said. McCain's Youngstown visit is part of a week-long tour of America's \"forgotten areas,\" where he primarily courted voters in Alabama and Louisiana. In Youngstown, about 1 in 4 residents lives below the poverty line, and 1 in 13 is unemployed.",

            "article_content": "How to achieve universal health coverage is a major issue in this year's presidential campaign. Massachusetts has implemented a 2006 law requiring nearly every citizen to sign up for health insurance or pay a tax penalty. Read about the candidates' positions on health care.  STEVE INSKEEP, host: Much of the presidential campaign is focused on the candidates' personal stories, but you can find differences on the issues, and this morning we are going to examine one of those issues, healthcare. Barack Obama and John McCain contend we do not need sweeping mandates to get all Americans insured. Senator Hillary Clinton, however, favors a health plan similar in some ways to a law in Massachusetts. That 2006 law requires nearly every citizen to sign up for health insurance or pay a tax penalty. This morning NPR's Richard Knox checks in on how the Massachusetts plan is doing. RICHARD KNOX: Dee Cook is just the kind of person the Massachusetts insurance law is aimed at.  She's a 59-year-old hairdresser. Ms. DEE COOK (Hairdresser): I've don it for 40 years. Yeah. Yeah, in March it will be 40 years since I got out of hair dressing school. KNOX: Cook hasn't had health insurance for 13 years. Her current employer doesn't provide it and she hasn't been able to afford it. Ms. COOK: My children have been on me about it. You know, Mom, you really need to get some health insurance. But up until last year, I just got out of debt management last year. I finished paying everybody off. KNOX: Finally, last November she signed up just under the deadline. Ms. COOK: I had to get it because of the new laws. KNOX: Cook is one of 16,000 or so Massachusetts workers to sign up for health insurance that they pay for entirely by themselves. Most of those who've signed up in Massachusetts are poor and near poor people who get coverage heavily subsidized by the state. Leslie Curwen(ph) is the state's top budget official. She also chairs the new agency set up to implement the new insurance law. Ms. LESLIE CURWEN (Budget Official, Massachusetts): I think it's a great success so far. We've celebrated 300,000 people newly enrolled in health insurance, which is a real milestone. KNOX: In fact, you might say the Massachusetts plan has been too successful. Tens of thousands more people have signed up for state subsidized coverage for poor and near poor than state officials expected. In effect, the new law has smoked out far more uninsured citizens than the state knew existed. That's led to some confusing headlines implying cost overruns in the range of $400,000,000. In fact, Curwen says, most of that was planned growth. The overrun is closer to $120 million - a worry, she says, but not a catastrophe. Ms. CURWEN: Is it without concern? Certainly not. We know that the sustainability of it financially is a concern. We need to work on that. KNOX: Massachusetts' biggest worry at the moment is whether the Bush administration will renew a Medicaid waiver that allows the federal government to pay for about half the program. Recently the administration has told other states they can't use federal money for similar subsidies of the near poor. Ms. CURWEN: It is absolutely critical that we maintain the support of the federal government for this program. KNOX: Beyond the details, though, the Massachusetts program poses a question at the heart of the national debate. Is it going to be necessary to mandate that all individuals buy insurance in order to get to universal coverage? Hillary Clinton thinks so. Jonathan Gruber, an MIT economist who's on the board of the new Massachusetts agency, agrees. Mr. JONATHAN GRUBER (Department of Economics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology): If you just simply said, we are going to take the kind of Massachusetts-style plan, you know, subsidies and a new reformed insurance market. And we are not going to have a mandate; you can at best cover about half the uninsured. KNOX: Without a mandate he says, people with higher medical expenses will sign up, but many who don't expect to need care will stay out. Mr. GRUBER: The right way that insurance works is that people have insurance all the time so that when they are healthy, they pay more than they would spend in that given year. When they're sick, they collect more than they pay in that given year. That's the whole idea of insurance. KNOX: Barack Obama doesn't like mandates, except for covering children. He says penalties have to be too stiff to force people to buy coverage. John McCain doesn't propose mandates at all. Instead, he favors tax credits. Both believe if health insurance is made affordable, people will buy it, although Obama and McCain have major differences on how to do that. But the debate over how to achieve universal coverage isn't just to the right of Clinton; many to her left also oppose mandated health insurance, like Bob Kuttner, co-editor of the American Prospect magazine and a Boston Globe columnist. Mr. BOB KUTTNER (Co-editor, The American Prospect; Columnist, Boston Globe): It's a very bizarre position for a liberal to be in, to say to the citizen, rather than providing a service that's tax-supported because you as an American ought to have this service, we are going to make you go out and find something or you pay a penalty. This is exactly the sort of thing that causes people to resent government. KNOX: Kuttner favors government sponsored health coverage, sort of Medicare for all. But he acknowledges that some kind of intermediate step, perhaps a mandate on employers to buy insurance, might be necessary. It seems safe to say that the debate won't be settled by November's election, so the Massachusetts experiment will remain relevant. Dee Cook, the newly insured hairdresser, is reserving judgment on it. I asked her if she thinks the Massachusetts law is a good thing. Ms. COOK: Check back in a couple of years. See how it's working. KNOX: Even staunch supporters of the Massachusetts plan say it's too early to declare it a success and it's too soon to call it a failure. Richard Knox, NPR News, Boston. INSKEEP: We'll look more deeply at this issue on Monday when we will check the differences between the two leading Democrats on how they would achieve health coverage for all Americans.

Barack Obama was educated at top-notch schools: Occidental College, Columbia University and Harvard Law School. But the presidential candidate has repeatedly said that he got his best education as a community organizer at Altgeld Gardens, a public housing complex in Chicago. The phrase \"community organizer\" conjures up do-gooder images, soup kitchens and Meals-on-Wheels programs. But it doesn't quite capture the bare-knuckle aspects of the job. Obama organized residents at Altgeld Gardens to pressure the city to improve education and dangerous environmental conditions in the area. His aim was to turn grievances into action, which took a combination of motivation and intimidation in the form of votes, protests and organized boycotts. In Chicago, community-organizing is often how things get done politically. And the organizers often lock horns with the city's entrenched political machine. At Altgeld, Obama became frustrated when change was slow in coming. Eventually, he decided to leave Chicago to attend law school at Harvard. \"We could change people's lives on a one-on-one basis and change small things in neighborhoods,\" says Jerry Kellman, who hired Obama at Altgeld. \"But if you were interested in transformation of race and poverty, it would take a long time doing that by community-organizing \u2014 and many, many generations.\" Successful community-organizing campaigns are viral in nature. Enthusiasm or anger spreads from person to person, eventually building a groundswell. Politics has always worked much the same way, but Kellman says Obama added a new twist. From text message voting-day alerts to the My Obama Weblogs, the candidate used technology to spread his message in new ways. \"It's the first campaign that we've ever had that has depended on some lessons from organizing,\" Kellman says. \"And it couples that old-fashioned organizing with new technologies. ...It's changed the face of politics forever.\"",

Daley had amassed a force of 12,000 police officers, 6,000 National Guard members and 6,000 Army troops. He assured convention delegates that all would be well. One of the chief organizers of the anti-war demonstrations, Tom Hayden, says protest leaders worked for months to get permits from the city to march, to rally and to camp in the parks. \"We were used to the idea that authorities would stall on permits, but I think some of us thought that the permits would come through at the end, so we went forward,\" he says. But the permits didn't come. So there was almost nothing protesters could do without violating the law. The massive crowd that the organizers hoped for didn't materialize. \"When the week started, there were only 600 or 700 people in the park,\" Hayden says. \"It grew to about 10,000, nearly all of them from Chicago.\" Violence became a daily event, with marches and rallies broken up by police with nightsticks and tear gas. It was the same most nights in the parks. Protesters would gather, and after the 11 p.m. curfew, the police would move in with clubs and gas, chasing them into the streets. Violence In The Street On one of those nights, Vivian Stovall and a mixed-race group of friends sat down in Grant Park and formed a human chain. \"Next thing we knew, we were being kicked, being pulled apart and some very racial statements being made. And then I looked up, and when I looked up that's when I got hit. I still have the scar right here,\" Stovall says, pointing to her eyebrow. \"I remember feeling that warm wet stuff on my face, and I was bleeding.\" She was 19 years old in 1968. She'd been driving from Washington, D.C., to Louisiana to start the new semester at Grambling State University when she and some classmates decided to take a detour to Chicago. \"We were talking while we were on our way there about the assassination of Robert Kennedy, the assassination of Martin Luther King [Jr.]. We talked about the Vietnam War,\" Stovall says. \"We just felt nobody was listening to us at that time anyway, and we wanted to just have our say or at least be part of something.\" The most infamous battle took place on Aug. 28 outside the Conrad Hilton hotel. It wasn't the most violent confrontation that week by most accounts, but it's the one that got the most news coverage, because the Hilton was where the media were stationed. As it unfolded, CBS engineer Fred Turner described what he saw from his fifth-floor window: \"Now they're moving in, the cops are moving and they are really belting these characters. They're grabbing them, sticks are flailing. People are laying on the ground. I can see them, colored people. Cops are just belting them; cops are just laying it in. There's piles of bodies on the street. There's no question about it. You can hear the screams, and there's a guy they're just dragging along the street and they don't care. I don't think ... I don't know if he's alive or dead. Holy Jesus, look at him. Five of them are belting him, really, oh, this man will never get up.\" It's not the sort of experience anyone would want to repeat. But there are people who see something in those days worth reviving. The Spirit Of The '60s Mark Cohen is the co-founder of the activist group Recreate '68. Although he wasn't in Chicago in 1968 \u2014 he was in Africa with the Peace Corps \u2014 Cohen says his organization's name was meant to get attention and recall the spirit of the '60s, not the violence. He's been planning to protest at this week's Democratic convention since he heard it was coming to his hometown of Denver. \"The reason we're protesting is because Mr. Obama's reputation as a progressive is not really deserved,\" Cohen says. \"For example, his so-called anti-war stance involves a program to remove combat troops from Iraq over a period of 16 months. The majority of American people want those troops removed immediately. As soon as possible.\" He was standing in what will be the official demonstration zone for the convention. He and the rest of Recreate '68 will be in parking lot A, nearly 300 yards from the convention hall. \"We call it the freedom cage,\" says Cohen, 62. The zone will be ringed by two layers of fencing behind a huge white tent set up for the media. And for protest marches, the sanctioned route will leave marchers more than a quarter of a mile from the convention site. Recreate '68 and other groups sued the city of Denver and the Secret Service to get closer to the action, but a federal judge upheld the city's plans. Katherine Archuleta, Denver's lead planner for the convention, said the demonstration zone provides a fair and safe platform for activists. \"People can go and come as they like. The other thing that we are doing in the demonstration zone is to provide a stage and speakers and microphone, so that they can be heard [at] a greater distance,\" Archuleta says. \"And that's the city's role \u2014 finding a balance between safety and security and the rights of those who would come and want to raise their voices.\" Hayden doesn't see it that way. \"I don't mean to exaggerate, but it is the end of freedom. This is the freedom to protest as designed for you by any authoritarian state under the direction of the police,\" he says. Expanding Agenda Caged or not, when demonstrators raise their voices in Denver, they will be talking \u2014 or singing or shouting \u2014 about more than the war in Iraq. The environment will be on the agenda, as well as poverty, health care, immigrant rights and more. Michael Heaney, a political scientist at the University of Florida, says that because of 1968, \"we've now become a 'movement society.' \" \"What 1968 demonstrated was that protest could be an effective tactic for bringing about social change,\" he says. \"So important new protest tactics were invented: the sit-in, the large demonstration. And people learned that this was a way they could effectively influence the government.\" Heaney's been studying the current anti-war movement and has noticed something interesting about who's in it. He says there are essentially two groups \u2014 one made up of people who were active in the anti-war movement 40 years ago, and the other made up of people in their 20s \u2014 and very little in between. The convention protests planned in Denver will have a kind of retro quality. In addition to Recreate '68, there's another activist group called Tent State University, a reference to Kent State in Ohio, where four students were killed while protesting the war in Vietnam. Outsiders Moving In Meanwhile, the organization that Hayden helped found in the 1960s, Students for a Democratic Society, is springing up again on college campuses. Over the past four decades, Hayden has gone from outside agitator to Democratic Party insider. He served in the California state Legislature for 18 years and has been a delegate to national Democratic conventions six times. Stovall has also become a party activist. She's been to four conventions, and she'll be in Denver as a delegate for Barack Obama. It's kind of silly, she says, to try to keep protesters away from the delegates, many of whom have put in time on picket lines and marches just like she has. \"A large percentage of those delegates have people out there who are rallying or protesting issues that they care about,\" Stovall says. \"And as a matter of fact, as a delegate, I might get out there myself.\"",

            "article_content": "Barack Obama's presidential campaign said Wednesday that Jim Johnson, the head of Obama's vice-presidential selection team, resigned. Presumptive GOP presidential nominee John McCain has said Johnson was the type of Washington insider the Illinois senator promised to campaign against.  STEVE INSKEEP, host: It's MORNING EDITION from NPR News. Good morning. I'm Steve Inskeep. RENEE MONTAGNE, host: And I'm Renee Montagne. Both presidential candidates won their nominations by promising something different. In a word: change. And we'll hear more about that word in a moment. We begin with something that hasn't changed. Both John McCain and Barack Obama depend on veteran Washington insiders, and one of those insiders has just been forced to resign. He was the man leading Barack Obama's vice presidential selection team. Joining us now for some analysis is NPR's Juan Williams. Good morning, Juan. JUAN WILLIAMS: Good morning, Renee. MONTAGNE: So Jim Johnson came under scrutiny over his personal and professional financial dealings almost as soon as his name was announced. You know, why did he end up resigning? WILLIAMS: Well, he'd become a distraction to the Obama campaign, just as the campaign was trying to get in gear for the general election. Senator Obama is trying to raise the question of how the Republicans have dealt with the economy and to focus on that issue and the idea of reform. Jim Johnson had received several favorable rates on loans for houses from Countrywide Financial, which is now the target of federal scrutiny in the subprime mortgage crisis. He also served on the boards of several companies that have given lavish pay packages to executives. So, technically, Jim Johnson has done nothing illegal, Renee, but his mere presence gave the McCain campaign the opportunity to say that Senator Obama was close to the kind of insiders and special interest groups that he often charges are part of the McCain campaign with the Republicans, and that he's trying to push out of Washington. So, all of the sudden, charges of hypocrisy were everywhere in the air. MONTAGNE: And it makes you wonder why Obama selected Jim Johnson in the first place. WILLIAMS: Well, you know, Jim Johnson is a guy who is seen as the quintessential Washington insider. He had served as a Senate staffer to Walter Mondale back and then chief of staff when Mondale became vice president. He's the past head of Fannie Mae, the Kennedy Center, the Brookings Institution. As I say, a real player in Democratic Party politics. And he was a man also, I might say, in charge of vetting vice presidential candidates for Walter Mondale in '84 and John Kerry in '04. So he had experience in exactly this line of business that Obama was concerned with, finding the right vice presidential nominee. MONTAGNE: Of course, we've heard a lot about the McCain campaign having lots of lobbyists and insiders in charge of its various political activities, including its vice presidential selection team. WILLIAMS: Well, that's right. Arthur Culverhouse, Renee. And at the top of the McCain campaign, you have people like Rick Davis and Charlie Black. All of them have ties to major lobbying operations. In fact, a few weeks ago, one of McCain's top aides had to resign because he had lobbied for Burma/Myanmar and the junta there. And there's pressure already on the McCain team to push out people like the Charlie Black and Rick Davis because of their past lobbying connections. So, what happened here was that Johnson raising his profile and his lavish lifestyle in Washington gave the McCain camp an opportunity to say, hey, wait a second. You're pointing fingers when you're guilty of the same sin. MONTAGNE: Juan, thanks very much. WILLIAMS: You're welcome, Renee. MONTAGNE: NPR's Juan Williams. Copyright \u00a9 2008 NPR.

            "article_content": "Amid continued post-election violence in Kenya, at least 50 people are killed when a mob sets fire to a church west of the capital, Nairobi. Opponents to re-elected President Mwai Kibaki, who was sworn in Sunday, say the vote was rigged.  MICHELE NORRIS, host: From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Michele Norris. And we start this part of our New Year's Day program in Kenya. At least 250 people are now reported killed in post-election violence there. The conflict began on Sunday when election results returned incumbent President Mwai Kibaki. But the challenger, Raila Odinga, has refused to concede the vote. And the nation has been paralyzed by ethnic conflict and a de facto state of emergency. NPR's Gwen Thompkins is in Nairobi. GWEN THOMPKINS: What began as a political contest in Kenya has become a reckoning. Since President Mwai Kibaki took the oath of office on Sunday evening, much of the nation has been burned and looted, and people raped and killed. The ethnic groups that supported challenger Raila Odinga are in conflict with those that supported Kibaki. Earlier today in western Kenya, a Catholic church harboring women and children who had been burned out of their homes was itself burned. Aid workers estimate that at least 50 people were killed. Mr. MAINA KIAI (Chairman, Kenya National Commission on Human Rights): Innocent Kenyans did not do anything wrong. They exercised their right to vote whichever way they did it. And that's - they're not the problem. THOMPKINS: Maina Kiai heads the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights. The commission is calling on Kibaki and Odinga to do more to end the violence. Mr. KIAI: What we suggested is for Nelson Mandela moments, where the political leadership reaches out to the other side in dramatic gestures. THOMPKINS: On the face of it, Kenya is experiencing a backlash against Kibaki's tribespeople, the Kikuyu, and the other tribes that are seen as Kibaki supporters. The Kikuyu are the nation's largest ethnic group. They are perceived by Odinga's supporters to have prospered unfairly during Kibaki's first term. Cecilia Wanjira, a Kikuyu in the Kalanguari slum of Nairobi, watched her neighbors from different ethnic groups burn everything on her plot of land. Ms. CECILLA WANJIRA (Kikuyu): We want peace. We don't want that war because they are our brothers and sisters. THOMPKINS: But the dead and wounded across Kenya include many of Odinga's people as well, the Luo and other tribes sympathetic to the Luo. Across the nation, people are being told to stay in their homes or at some other shelter where they feel safe. Most businesses have not been open since Christmas Eve. Hooliganism is rampant. Hunger is increasing. The government has banned public demonstrations. Live television broadcasts are off the air, and security forces are on red alert. As Kibaki and Odinga remain at a standstill, so does everyone else. Mr. ALEXANDER GRAF LAMBSDORFF (Chief Observer, Election Monitoring Delegation, European Union): We find that these elections have fallen short of key international and regional standards for Democratic elections to which Kenyans committed themselves. THOMPKINS: Alexander Graf Lambsdorff heads the European Union's election monitoring delegation. He says Kibaki may have had the most votes, but the mistakes made in the tallying have eroded his confidence in the veracity of the final count. He's calling for an independent investigation into the matter. Kiai, of the Commission on Human Rights, is calling for a recount. But for now, Kiai says, he would sell for some goodwill food. Mr. KIAI: So it's just, for example, the government sends foods to the Kibera slum, which is perceived to be a Raila Odinga stronghold, to show that they care for every Kenyan, and vice versa for Raila Odinga to reach out to Kurasoi(ph) in Molo, which is perceived to be a Kibaki stronghold, and take some food there. THOMPKINS: As of now, no one can tell if the situation is getting better or worse. On Wednesday, many Kenyans expect to go back to work. And some say that normalcy will prevail. One Kikuyu tour operator in Nairobi seemed confident that his tribespeople will quickly recover from this time of trouble. We Kikuyu are so many, he said, we are mighty.

            "article_content": "Charges of voter fraud have been growing in recent weeks, most notably with Republican attacks against an anti-poverty group known as the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, or ACORN. The group, which has submitted more than 1 million voter registrations, has come under fire after several thousand of the submissions were found to be phony. But the intensity of the attacks from the Republican National Committee and Sen. John McCain's campaign has also raised questions about Republican motives. Critics said that ACORN is part of an effort to steal votes and possibly throw the outcome of the election into doubt. Former Missouri Sen. John Danforth co-chairs the McCain campaign's Honest and Open Election Committee, and he said whoever loses on Nov. 4 could feel cheated and want to challenge the results in court. \"If there are a number of states where the election is close and there have been many, many people registered by this organization, ACORN, and where there are numerous cases of fraudulent registration, then the contest could go on for a very long time,\" he said. Rick Hasen, an election law expert at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles, said he thinks Republicans are leveling the criticisms in case they lose. \"I think this is just part of a kind of a long-term Republican strategy to play up allegations of voter fraud,\" Hasen said. \"As a kind of insurance policy in case there's a very close election.\" He said there is little evidence that voter registration fraud translates into fraud at the polls, even though that may be beside the point. \"The allegations alone certainly wouldn't be a basis for overturning an election, but I think they prepare the public for an aggressive kind of litigation strategy,\" he said. Republicans continue to mount the pressure, with their presidential nominee at the helm.   McCain himself has called for an investigation into ACORN's voter registration program, and Nevada authorities last week raided ACORN's Las Vegas office after the group submitted registrations for the starting lineup of the Dallas Cowboys. But ACORN officials defended their efforts, saying they're the ones pointing out problem registrations submitted by their canvassers, whom they pay by the hour, not by the registration.  They also said they're required by law to turn in every form they collect, even if it's signed by Donald Duck. ACORN spokesman Brian Kettenring said that although he knows the registration drives are far from perfect, \"there is absolutely no doubt in our mind that the attention being paid by the right at this time is tremendously disproportionate to the problem and is distracting from a litany of other issues.\" He and other voter advocates said the Republican attacks are all the more striking because allegations of widespread voter fraud have been repeatedly discredited. Most recently, in a report on the firings of U.S. attorneys accused of failing to pursue voter fraud cases, the Justice Department's inspector general found that such cases were generally dropped for lack of evidence. Republicans denied that they're only trying to lay the groundwork for a legal challenge, and they said that registration fraud is a serious threat. \"It very well could result in unqualified people voting. It could also result in people voting more than once,\" said former New Hampshire Sen. Warren Rudman, who co-chairs the McCain election committee with Danforth. \"And most importantly, because of the clog of paperwork of some of these registrations, it could deny election officials the time they need to get their registration lists in order.\" Rudman said that such an overload of paperwork might block legitimate voters from voting.  He and Danforth said they would like to work with Barack Obama's campaign to monitor polls on Election Day for irregularities. But Obama campaign officials said they'd prefer Republicans to clean up their own act.   They said Republicans are the ones trying to prevent legitimate voters from going to the polls by scaring them, pointing to an incident last week in Greene County, Ohio, where a sheriff sought the records of 302 people who had registered and voted early, because he said he was worried about possible fraud. Democrats called it a fishing expedition directed at newly registered college students.  The sheriff later dropped his request.",

            "article_content": "From The Federalist Papers to The Feminine Mystique, Jay Parini's Promised Land examines 13 books that shaped and changed America. Maureen Corrigan has a review.  TERRY GROSS, host: President-elect Barack Obama has plenty enough to do to ready himself for inauguration day. But if Jay Parini had his way, he'd probably give Obama a copy of his new book, \"Promised Land.\" In \"Promised Land,\" Parini, who's a novelist, poet, and scholar of American literature, has chosen the 13 books that he thinks are crucial to an understanding of American identity. Book critic Maureen Corrigan has a review. MAUREEN CORRIGAN: This election night, we added a few lines of update to one of our most cherished national myths, the belief that America is a land of limitless opportunity where anybody can become anything. Granted, Ben Franklin could never have imagined a President Barack Obama. But in broad strokes, Obama's story of a hard-won rise from obscurity is as old and as American as our founding father Franklin's own autobiographical tale, that begins with him landing in Philadelphia as a nobody with just a few cents and three puffy rolls in his threadbare pockets. The stories that we tell about ourselves as Americans shape our national identity. That's the self-evident truth of Jay Parini's latest book \"Promised Land,\" subtitled \"13 Books that Changed America.\" Parini's book comes out shrewdly, just in time for what promises to be a season of national self-reflection. In it, he explores not the great American canon, no \"Moby Dick\" or \"Leaves of Grass\" lurking here, but those works, mostly non-fiction and popular, that helped to define or consolidate our idea of what it means to be an American. Of course, as Parini acknowledges, the number 13 is a gimmick, echoing the number of original colonies. In his appendix, he lists 100 additional influential books, and he says even that list could have gone on and on. But given his self-imposed limit, Parini has made mostly thoughtful choices - Franklin's autobiography, \"The Federalist Papers,\" Thoreau's \"Walden,\" Stowe's \"Uncle Tom's Cabin,\" Friedan's \"The Feminine Mystique.\" A few of his picks are surprising, but he makes convincing cases for them - Mary Antin's immigrant memoir, \"The Promised Land,\" and Dr. Spock's \"Common Sense Book of Baby and Child Care.\" In every instance, Parini side steps the pitfall of a project like this one, that is feeling obliged to supply plot summaries for those books that lots of Americans once read, but that these days, lots of Americans only feel like they've read. Parini's background as a poet comes in handy here. He's able to do justice to the voice, tone, and thesis of, say, a book like W.E.B. Du Bois' \"The Souls of Black Folks\" in just a few charged paragraphs. List books like Parini's are invitations to readers both to discover new treasures and to quibble. First, the treasures. Parini's haunting discussion of \"The Journals of Lewis and Clark\" made me not only want to go out and buy a copy, but to grab a canoe and start paddling upstream into the forest primeval. Here's one of the insights Parini offers about the journals. In the tradition of nature writing, Lewis and Clark rank high as practitioners. Their close observation of the western landscapes still inspires awe. They offered the first descriptions of grizzly bears, prairie dogs, antelope and mountain goats, and, alas, mosquitoes.' These moments in the journals dazzled readers and established a mode of reporting about the natural world that persists in writers like Barry Lopez and Gretel Ehrlich. Less reverential but just as revelatory is Parini's lively discussion of Dale Carnegie's 1936 blockbuster, \"How to Win Friends and Influence People,\" a book, Parini says that's squarely in the enterprising small businessman spirit of Franklin's autobiography. Parini also points out that, between 1989, when Communism failed in Russia, and 1997, Carnegie's self-help tome went through 68 editions in Russia. So the quibble, Jack Kerouac's 1957 run-on monument to his own narcissism, \"On The Road.\" I've read it numerous times and remain unmoved. I know there are good reasons for the pick, and Parini makes all the logical arguments. But since he devotes so few chapters to American novels, I would have voted for Gatsby or even for Dashiell Hammett's great mystery, \"The Maltese Falcon,\" given that hard-boiled detective fiction is a homegrown American genre. But Parini's list is his own autocratic creation, not a democracy. Especially at this time in our history, readers will benefit from dipping into Parini's book and reacquainting themselves with the nation's bedrock myths and stories, even as new American stories are about to be written.

Read an excerpt of Grand New Party. The Republican Party has often been stereotyped as the party of wealthy, old white men, but conservative writers Ross Douthat and Reihan Salam think that can change. Their new book, Grand New Party, offers a vision of a new era of conservatism. According to the book, the Republican Party must widen its base to include independent, working-class voters if it is to compete with the Democratic Party. These \"Sam's Club voters,\" as the book refers to them, have been responsible for a number of Republican victories, but they are not a core constituency for the party and often support Democratic candidates. In order to court this demographic, the Republican Party must balance policy that is oriented toward cultural values with economic inequality, say Douthat and Salam. The two argue that Democratic cultural liberalism alienates working-class voters, but the Republican Party's pro-business economic policy is unfriendly toward this swath of voters. By shifting their economic stance and continuing to promote family values, the GOP can actively reclaim the \"silent majority.\" Both Douthat and Salam are editors at The Atlantic. They have collaborated on pieces for The National Review and The Weekly Standard. The two have also worked together on The American Scene blog. Douthat is also the author of Privilege: Harvard and the Education of the Ruling Class, a memoir and critique of his alma mater.

            "article_content": "When nearly 300 bishops from Africa, South America and breakaway churches in the U.S. gathered in Jerusalem last week, the big question was: Will they declare schism from the more liberal churches in the West? The answer turned out to be easy. \"We all sat around the table, and pretty well with one voice, we said, we are not leaving the Anglican Communion,\" Archbishop Greg Venables, who oversees several countries in South America, said from Jerusalem. \"We are not going to break away and form another church.\" There had been talk preceding the meeting of a theological divorce. The group did not split because, Venables says, \"we are the true Anglicans.\" \"We don't accept that we can hand over the franchise of Anglicanism to people who suddenly, without consulting anyone, decided to create a new version of Anglicanism,\" he says. Shots Across The Bow That new version that liberal Anglicans embrace, of course, is a modern interpretation of Scripture that allows for gay clergy and same-sex blessings. With the two sides unwilling to compromise, the conservative leaders aimed two shots across the bow. First, they declared that they no longer see the archbishop of Canterbury as the one who decides who is Anglican or not. Second, they said they intend to form an alternative church or province in North America \u2014 one that would compete with the Episcopal Church for members, money and church property. \"Things don't become so because they say they're so,\" says Jim Naughton, the canon for communications at the Diocese of Washington, D.C. \"They can decide that they are naming their collection of churches a province, but that doesn't mean the rest of the world will regard them that way. All these folks have managed to do is put a bow on the status quo, and call it a present.\" Naughton says neither the archbishop of Canterbury nor the rest of the worldwide communion would allow foreign bishops to carve out a new church in the U.S. without permission from the Episcopal Church. Rowan Williams, the archbishop of Canterbury, warned conservatives that they were treading on thin ice: \"Any claim to be free to operate across provincial boundaries is fraught with difficulty,\" he said in a statement. He urged them to \"think very carefully.\" 'Who's Going To Stop Us?' Martyn Minns, who moved his Virginia parish from the Episcopal Church to the more conservative church of Nigeria, asks: \"Who's going to stop us? We don't have ecclesiastical jails these days; there's freedom of religion, there's freedom to associate and freedom of religious expression.\" And, Minns says, freedom to let people choose which form of Anglicanism they like. Which brings us to an important undercurrent of this debate. \"Let's not be too naive about this all being theological and biblical argument,\" says Gene Robinson, the openly gay bishop of New Hampshire whose election sparked the current crisis. \"This is also about money and property.\" Dozens of parishes have left the Episcopal Church and moved under the authority of foreign bishops, and some have tried to keep their property and buildings, worth millions of dollars. Some have lost, but others have won. On Friday, for example, a Virginia judge ruled that 11 breakaway churches have a constitutional right to keep their properties. If conservative churches can create an alternative province in the U.S., Robinson says, that would strengthen their arguments in the courts. But Robinson and others are taking a historical view. He says time and again \u2014 in debates over things like the prayer book or women's ordination \u2014 conservatives have said the end is near. \"There have been lines drawn in the sand before, or a donnybrook predicted, and then it doesn't happen,\" Robinson says. Still, the conservatives claim close to two-thirds of practicing Anglicans, and their numbers are growing. Eventually, they say, their views will prevail.",

Yemen occupies an often-forgotten corner of the Middle East, but it has been getting attention recently as an unreliable partner in the Bush administration's war on terrorism. American aid to Yemen is down and political pressure is up as the U.S. presses for tougher punishment for militants, including some involved in the bombing of the USS Cole in 2000 \u2014 one of the earliest al-Qaida strikes against America. But Yemeni officials say the government isn't strong enough to defeat the extremists militarily, and warn that the hard line from Washington, D.C., could backfire. Yemen Unable to Keep Militants in Custody Yemen is a land endowed with stunning physical beauty and a long and rich human history as the ancestral heartland of the Arabs. It also is burdened with crushing poverty and explosive population growth, and is viewed with mistrust by its wealthy Persian Gulf neighbors. Lately, Washington has been taking an even dimmer view. Inside the walled capital city of San'a, the late-afternoon sun casts a gingerbread-house glow on the mud brick buildings that rise as high as nine stories above the narrow streets. Shopowners call out to the few European tourists wandering through one of the oldest continuously inhabited places on Earth. Americans are even scarcer here: The State Department has issued a travel advisory, and the U.S. Embassy evacuated nonessential personnel after a mortar attack in March. Perhaps most damaging to Yemen's reputation in Washington has been the government's failure to keep convicted Islamist militants in custody. In 2006, a prison break freed a number of militants, including Jamal al-Badawi, one of the organizers of the 2000 USS Cole bombing at the port of Aden that left 17 American sailors dead \u2014 one of al-Qaida's more significant pre-Sept. 11 attacks. Badawi was returned to custody, but then quietly released after agreeing to help locate other militants. U.S. officials demanded his extradition, without success. \"Yemen is at a crossroads,\" says a senior diplomatic source in San'a, who adds that there has been \"a series of internal problems that have reinvigorated al-Qaida in Yemen, and as yet there has been no real injection of governmental effort to stop it.\" That, he says, has to happen. Security Problems Acknowledged Former Yemeni Prime Minister Adbul Kareem al-Eryani says security is a serious problem for his struggling country. \"We do have a problem with terrorists. There's no question about it. We have a view about how to handle some of the cases, which is not the right policy as far as the United States is concerned. But I think the debate should continue,\" he says. Yemeni officials argue that for one thing, their constitution bars the extradition of Badawi; and for another, handing over Yemeni citizens to the Americans is politically impossible with elections looming next year. Government Tries Dialogue with Militants As for confrontation, one senior Yemeni official says they tried that a few years ago in the mountainous north, and the ensuing stalemate served mainly to weaken the army's image and embolden other antigovernment groups. Analyst Abdullah al-Fiqah at Sana'a University says he initially opposed the government's effort to open a dialogue with the militants, but now he is unsure whether there is any other option. \"Some people in the West think, 'The Yemeni government is making friends with al Qaida.' If you cannot make them enemies, then it's better for you to make them friends,\" he says. \"I don't think the government is in a position that it can confront al Qaida. They can overrun the government if they want to.\" Unfortunately for Yemen, its Gulf neighbors seem to prefer it in a weakened state. When formerly socialist south Yemen fought a civil war for independence from the north in 1994, all six members of the Gulf Cooperation Council sided with the rebels. Perhaps not unexpectedly, the Bush administration's foreign policies have made it as unpopular here as anywhere in the region. Yemenis say sermons at Friday Muslim prayers frequently condemn both America and Israel. San'a Squeezed Internally, Externally Meanwhile, a series of other conflicts continues to distract the government. To the north, Islamist militants are increasingly aggressive, and in the oil-producing parts of southern Yemen, infighting has sprung up between tribes vying for jobs and revenues. Eryani, the former prime minister, says he understands the American desire to see terrorists brought to justice. But suspending aid to a country as desperately poor and volatile as Yemen could rebound in unexpected ways: It would be, in his words, \"totally unproductive.\" \"Yemen is a very critically positioned country. Disruption of public life in Yemen is very serious to its neighbors. And the same is true in the interests of the United States, so squeezing is not the answer,\" he says. At the moment, Yemen is being squeezed by a severe drought and critical water shortages, soaring food prices and plummeting tourism revenues. With the U.S. deeply involved in its own election-year drama, Yemenis don't expect much change in their status as a place that doesn't get much attention until something goes very wrong.",

The full text of the speech is available after the jump. Tell us what you think of the speech and how it will impact the campaign. \"A More Perfect Union\"March 18, 2008Philadelphia, Pennsylvania \"We the people, in order to form a more perfect union.\" Two hundred and twenty one years ago, in a hall that still stands across the street, a group of men gathered and, with these simple words, launched America's improbable experiment in democracy. Farmers and scholars; statesmen and patriots who had traveled across an ocean to escape tyranny and persecution finally made real their declaration of independence at a Philadelphia convention that lasted through the spring of 1787. The document they produced was eventually signed but ultimately unfinished. It was stained by this nation's original sin of slavery, a question that divided the colonies and brought the convention to a stalemate until the founders chose to allow the slave trade to continue for at least twenty more years, and to leave any final resolution to future generations. Of course, the answer to the slavery question was already embedded within our Constitution -- a Constitution that had at is very core the ideal of equal citizenship under the law; a Constitution that promised its people liberty, and justice, and a union that could be and should be perfected over time. And yet words on a parchment would not be enough to deliver slaves from bondage, or provide men and women of every color and creed their full rights and obligations as citizens of the United States. What would be needed were Americans in successive generations who were willing to do their part -- through protests and struggle, on the streets and in the courts, through a civil war and civil disobedience and always at great risk -- to narrow that gap between the promise of our ideals and the reality of their time. This was one of the tasks we set forth at the beginning of this campaign -- to continue the long march of those who came before us, a march for a more just, more equal, more free, more caring and more prosperous America. I chose to run for the presidency at this moment in history because I believe deeply that we cannot solve the challenges of our time unless we solve them together -- unless we perfect our union by understanding that we may have different stories, but we hold common hopes; that we may not look the same and we may not have come from the same place, but we all want to move in the same direction -- towards a better future for of children and our grandchildren. This belief comes from my unyielding faith in the decency and generosity of the American people. But it also comes from my own American story. I am the son of a black man from Kenya and a white woman from Kansas. I was raised with the help of a white grandfather who survived a Depression to serve in Patton's Army during World War II and a white grandmother who worked on a bomber assembly line at Fort Leavenworth while he was overseas. I've gone to some of the best schools in America and lived in one of the world's poorest nations. I am married to a black American who carries within her the blood of slaves and slaveowners -- an inheritance we pass on to our two precious daughters. I have brothers, sisters, nieces, nephews, uncles and cousins, of every race and every hue, scattered across three continents, and for as long as I live, I will never forget that in no other country on Earth is my story even possible. It's a story that hasn't made me the most conventional candidate. But it is a story that has seared into my genetic makeup the idea that this nation is more than the sum of its parts -- that out of many, we are truly one. Throughout the first year of this campaign, against all predictions to the contrary, we saw how hungry the American people were for this message of unity. Despite the temptation to view my candidacy through a purely racial lens, we won commanding victories in states with some of the whitest populations in the country. In South Carolina, where the Confederate Flag still flies, we built a powerful coalition of African Americans and white Americans. This is not to say that race has not been an issue in the campaign. At various stages in the campaign, some commentators have deemed me either \"too black\" or \"not black enough.\" We saw racial tensions bubble to the surface during the week before the South Carolina primary. The press has scoured every exit poll for the latest evidence of racial polarization, not just in terms of white and black, but black and brown as well. And yet, it has only been in the last couple of weeks that the discussion of race in this campaign has taken a particularly divisive turn. On one end of the spectrum, we've heard the implication that my candidacy is somehow an exercise in affirmative action; that it's based solely on the desire of wide-eyed liberals to purchase racial reconciliation on the cheap. On the other end, we've heard my former pastor, Reverend Jeremiah Wright, use incendiary language to express views that have the potential not only to widen the racial divide, but views that denigrate both the greatness and the goodness of our nation; that rightly offend white and black alike. I have already condemned, in unequivocal terms, the statements of Reverend Wright that have caused such controversy. For some, nagging questions remain. Did I know him to be an occasionally fierce critic of American domestic and foreign policy? Of course. Did I ever hear him make remarks that could be considered controversial while I sat in church? Yes. Did I strongly disagree with many of his political views? Absolutely -- just as I'm sure many of you have heard remarks from your pastors, priests, or rabbis with which you strongly disagreed. But the remarks that have caused this recent firestorm weren't simply controversial. They weren't simply a religious leader's effort to speak out against perceived injustice. Instead, they expressed a profoundly distorted view of this country -- a view that sees white racism as endemic, and that elevates what is wrong with America above all that we know is right with America; a view that sees the conflicts in the Middle East as rooted primarily in the actions of stalwart allies like Israel, instead of emanating from the perverse and hateful ideologies of radical Islam. As such, Reverend Wright's comments were not only wrong but divisive, divisive at a time when we need unity; racially charged at a time when we need to come together to solve a set of monumental problems -- two wars, a terrorist threat, a falling economy, a chronic health care crisis and potentially devastating climate change; problems that are neither black or white or Latino or Asian, but rather problems that confront us all. Given my background, my politics, and my professed values and ideals, there will no doubt be those for whom my statements of condemnation are not enough. Why associate myself with Reverend Wright in the first place, they may ask? Why not join another church? And I confess that if all that I knew of Reverend Wright were the snippets of those sermons that have run in an endless loop on the television and You Tube, or if Trinity United Church of Christ conformed to the caricatures being peddled by some commentators, there is no doubt that I would react in much the same way But the truth is, that isn't all that I know of the man. The man I met more than twenty years ago is a man who helped introduce me to my Christian faith, a man who spoke to me about our obligations to love one another; to care for the sick and lift up the poor. He is a man who served his country as a U.S. Marine; who has studied and lectured at some of the finest universities and seminaries in the country, and who for over thirty years led a church that serves the community by doing God's work here on Earth -- by housing the homeless, ministering to the needy, providing day care services and scholarships and prison ministries, and reaching out to those suffering from HIV/AIDS. In my first book, Dreams From My Father, I described the experience of my first service at Trinity: \"People began to shout, to rise from their seats and clap and cry out, a forceful wind carrying the reverend's voice up into the rafters. ...And in that single note -- hope! -- I heard something else; at the foot of that cross, inside the thousands of churches across the city, I imagined the stories of ordinary black people merging with the stories of David and Goliath, Moses and Pharaoh, the Christians in the lion's den, Ezekiel's field of dry bones. Those stories -- of survival, and freedom, and hope -- became our story, my story; the blood that had spilled was our blood, the tears our tears; until this black church, on this bright day, seemed once more a vessel carrying the story of a people into future generations and into a larger world. Our trials and triumphs became at once unique and universal, black and more than black; in chronicling our journey, the stories and songs gave us a means to reclaim memories that we didn't need to feel shame about -- memories that all people might study and cherish -- and with which we could start to rebuild.\" That has been my experience at Trinity. Like other predominantly black churches across the country, Trinity embodies the black community in its entirety -- the doctor and the welfare mom, the model student and the former gang-banger. Like other black churches, Trinity's services are full of raucous laughter and sometimes bawdy humor. They are full of dancing, clapping, screaming and shouting that may seem jarring to the untrained ear. The church contains in full the kindness and cruelty, the fierce intelligence and the shocking ignorance, the struggles and successes, the love and yes, the bitterness and bias that make up the black experience in America. And this helps explain, perhaps, my relationship with Reverend Wright. As imperfect as he may be, he has been like family to me. He strengthened my faith, officiated my wedding, and baptized my children. Not once in my conversations with him have I heard him talk about any ethnic group in derogatory terms, or treat whites with whom he interacted with anything but courtesy and respect. He contains within him the contradictions -- the good and the bad -- of the community that he has served diligently for so many years. I can no more disown him than I can disown the black community. I can no more disown him than I can my white grandmother -- a woman who helped raise me, a woman who sacrificed again and again for me, a woman who loves me as much as she loves anything in this world, but a woman who once confessed her fear of black men who passed by her on the street, and who on more than one occasion has uttered racial or ethnic stereotypes that made me cringe. These people are a part of me. And they are a part of America, this country that I love. Some will see this as an attempt to justify or excuse comments that are simply inexcusable. I can assure you it is not. I suppose the politically safe thing would be to move on from this episode and just hope that it fades into the woodwork. We can dismiss Reverend Wright as a crank or a demagogue, just as some have dismissed Geraldine Ferraro, in the aftermath of her recent statements, as harboring some deep-seated racial bias. But race is an issue that I believe this nation cannot afford to ignore right now. We would be making the same mistake that Reverend Wright made in his offending sermons about America -- to simplify and stereotype and amplify the negative to the point that it distorts reality. The fact is that the comments that have been made and the issues that have surfaced over the last few weeks reflect the complexities of race in this country that we've never really worked through -- a part of our union that we have yet to perfect. And if we walk away now, if we simply retreat into our respective corners, we will never be able to come together and solve challenges like health care, or education, or the need to find good jobs for every American. Understanding this reality requires a reminder of how we arrived at this point. As William Faulkner once wrote, \"The past isn't dead and buried. In fact, it isn't even past.\" We do not need to recite here the history of racial injustice in this country. But we do need to remind ourselves that so many of the disparities that exist in the African-American community today can be directly traced to inequalities passed on from an earlier generation that suffered under the brutal legacy of slavery and Jim Crow. Segregated schools were, and are, inferior schools; we still haven't fixed them, fifty years after Brown v. Board of Education, and the inferior education they provided, then and now, helps explain the pervasive achievement gap between today's black and white students. Legalized discrimination - where blacks were prevented, often through violence, from owning property, or loans were not granted to African-American business owners, or black homeowners could not access FHA mortgages, or blacks were excluded from unions, or the police force, or fire departments -- meant that black families could not amass any meaningful wealth to bequeath to future generations. That history helps explain the wealth and income gap between black and white, and the concentrated pockets of poverty that persists in so many of today's urban and rural communities. A lack of economic opportunity among black men, and the shame and frustration that came from not being able to provide for one's family, contributed to the erosion of black families -- a problem that welfare policies for many years may have worsened. And the lack of basic services in so many urban black neighborhoods -- parks for kids to play in, police walking the beat, regular garbage pick-up and building code enforcement -- all helped create a cycle of violence, blight and neglect that continue to haunt us. This is the reality in which Reverend Wright and other African-Americans of his generation grew up. They came of age in the late fifties and early sixties, a time when segregation was still the law of the land and opportunity was systematically constricted. What's remarkable is not how many failed in the face of discrimination, but rather how many men and women overcame the odds; how many were able to make a way out of no way for those like me who would come after them. But for all those who scratched and clawed their way to get a piece of the American Dream, there were many who didn't make it -- those who were ultimately defeated, in one way or another, by discrimination. That legacy of defeat was passed on to future generations -- those young men and increasingly young women who we see standing on street corners or languishing in our prisons, without hope or prospects for the future. Even for those blacks who did make it, questions of race, and racism, continue to define their worldview in fundamental ways. For the men and women of Reverend Wright's generation, the memories of humiliation and doubt and fear have not gone away; nor has the anger and the bitterness of those years. That anger may not get expressed in public, in front of white co-workers or white friends. But it does find voice in the barbershop or around the kitchen table. At times, that anger is exploited by politicians, to gin up votes along racial lines, or to make up for a politician's own failings. And occasionally it finds voice in the church on Sunday morning, in the pulpit and in the pews. The fact that so many people are surprised to hear that anger in some of Reverend Wright's sermons simply reminds us of the old truism that the most segregated hour in American life occurs on Sunday morning. That anger is not always productive; indeed, all too often it distracts attention from solving real problems; it keeps us from squarely facing our own complicity in our condition, and prevents the African-American community from forging the alliances it needs to bring about real change. But the anger is real; it is powerful; and to simply wish it away, to condemn it without understanding its roots, only serves to widen the chasm of misunderstanding that exists between the races. In fact, a similar anger exists within segments of the white community. Most working- and middle-class white Americans don't feel that they have been particularly privileged by their race. Their experience is the immigrant experience -- as far as they're concerned, no one's handed them anything, they've built it from scratch. They've worked hard all their lives, many times only to see their jobs shipped overseas or their pension dumped after a lifetime of labor. They are anxious about their futures, and feel their dreams slipping away; in an era of stagnant wages and global competition, opportunity comes to be seen as a zero sum game, in which your dreams come at my expense. So when they are told to bus their children to a school across town; when they hear that an African American is getting an advantage in landing a good job or a spot in a good college because of an injustice that they themselves never committed; when they're told that their fears about crime in urban neighborhoods are somehow prejudiced, resentment builds over time. Like the anger within the black community, these resentments aren't always expressed in polite company. But they have helped shape the political landscape for at least a generation. Anger over welfare and affirmative action helped forge the Reagan Coalition. Politicians routinely exploited fears of crime for their own electoral ends. Talk show hosts and conservative commentators built entire careers unmasking bogus claims of racism while dismissing legitimate discussions of racial injustice and inequality as mere political correctness or reverse racism. Just as black anger often proved counterproductive, so have these white resentments distracted attention from the real culprits of the middle class squeeze -- a corporate culture rife with inside dealing, questionable accounting practices, and short-term greed; a Washington dominated by lobbyists and special interests; economic policies that favor the few over the many. And yet, to wish away the resentments of white Americans, to label them as misguided or even racist, without recognizing they are grounded in legitimate concerns -- this too widens the racial divide, and blocks the path to understanding. This is where we are right now. It's a racial stalemate we've been stuck in for years. Contrary to the claims of some of my critics, black and white, I have never been so naive as to believe that we can get beyond our racial divisions in a single election cycle, or with a single candidacy -- particularly a candidacy as imperfect as my own. But I have asserted a firm conviction -- a conviction rooted in my faith in God and my faith in the American people -- that working together we can move beyond some of our old racial wounds, and that in fact we have no choice is we are to continue on the path of a more perfect union. For the African-American community, that path means embracing the burdens of our past without becoming victims of our past. It means continuing to insist on a full measure of justice in every aspect of American life. But it also means binding our particular grievances -- for better health care, and better schools, and better jobs -- to the larger aspirations of all Americans -- the white woman struggling to break the glass ceiling, the white man whose been laid off, the immigrant trying to feed his family. And it means taking full responsibility for own lives -- by demanding more from our fathers, and spending more time with our children, and reading to them, and teaching them that while they may face challenges and discrimination in their own lives, they must never succumb to despair or cynicism; they must always believe that they can write their own destiny. Ironically, this quintessentially American -- and yes, conservative -- notion of self-help found frequent expression in Reverend Wright's sermons. But what my former pastor too often failed to understand is that embarking on a program of self-help also requires a belief that society can change. The profound mistake of Reverend Wright's sermons is not that he spoke about racism in our society. It's that he spoke as if our society was static; as if no progress has been made; as if this country -- a country that has made it possible for one of his own members to run for the highest office in the land and build a coalition of white and black; Latino and Asian, rich and poor, young and old -- is still irrevocably bound to a tragic past. But what we know -- what we have seen -- is that America can change. That is true genius of this nation. What we have already achieved gives us hope -- the audacity to hope -- for what we can and must achieve tomorrow. In the white community, the path to a more perfect union means acknowledging that what ails the African-American community does not just exist in the minds of black people; that the legacy of discrimination - and current incidents of discrimination, while less overt than in the past - are real and must be addressed. Not just with words, but with deeds -- by investing in our schools and our communities; by enforcing our civil rights laws and ensuring fairness in our criminal justice system; by providing this generation with ladders of opportunity that were unavailable for previous generations. It requires all Americans to realize that your dreams do not have to come at the expense of my dreams; that investing in the health, welfare, and education of black and brown and white children will ultimately help all of America prosper. In the end, then, what is called for is nothing more, and nothing less, than what all the world's great religions demand -- that we do unto others as we would have them do unto us. Let us be our brother's keeper, Scripture tells us. Let us be our sister's keeper. Let us find that common stake we all have in one another, and let our politics reflect that spirit as well. For we have a choice in this country. We can accept a politics that breeds division, and conflict, and cynicism. We can tackle race only as spectacle -- as we did in the OJ trial -- or in the wake of tragedy, as we did in the aftermath of Katrina -- or as fodder for the nightly news. We can play Reverend Wright's sermons on every channel, every day and talk about them from now until the election, and make the only question in this campaign whether or not the American people think that I somehow believe or sympathize with his most offensive words. We can pounce on some gaffe by a Hillary supporter as evidence that she's playing the race card, or we can speculate on whether white men will all flock to John McCain in the general election regardless of his policies. We can do that. But if we do, I can tell you that in the next election, we'll be talking about some other distraction. And then another one. And then another one. And nothing will change. That is one option. Or, at this moment, in this election, we can come together and say, \"Not this time.\" This time we want to talk about the crumbling schools that are stealing the future of black children and white children and Asian children and Hispanic children and Native American children. This time we want to reject the cynicism that tells us that these kids can't learn; that those kids who don't look like us are somebody else's problem. The children of America are not those kids, they are our kids, and we will not let them fall behind in a 21st century economy. Not this time. This time we want to talk about how the lines in the Emergency Room are filled with whites and blacks and Hispanics who do not have health care; who don't have the power on their own to overcome the special interests in Washington, but who can take them on if we do it together. This time we want to talk about the shuttered mills that once provided a decent life for men and women of every race, and the homes for sale that once belonged to Americans from every religion, every region, every walk of life. This time we want to talk about the fact that the real problem is not that someone who doesn't look like you might take your job; it's that the corporation you work for will ship it overseas for nothing more than a profit. This time we want to talk about the men and women of every color and creed who serve together, and fight together, and bleed together under the same proud flag. We want to talk about how to bring them home from a war that never should've been authorized and never should've been waged, and we want to talk about how we'll show our patriotism by caring for them, and their families, and giving them the benefits they have earned. I would not be running for President if I didn't believe with all my heart that this is what the vast majority of Americans want for this country. This union may never be perfect, but generation after generation has shown that it can always be perfected. And today, whenever I find myself feeling doubtful or cynical about this possibility, what gives me the most hope is the next generation -- the young people whose attitudes and beliefs and openness to change have already made history in this election. There is one story in particularly that I'd like to leave you with today -- a story I told when I had the great honor of speaking on Dr. King's birthday at his home church, Ebenezer Baptist, in Atlanta. There is a young, twenty-three year old white woman named Ashley Baia who organized for our campaign in Florence, South Carolina. She had been working to organize a mostly African-American community since the beginning of this campaign, and one day she was at a roundtable discussion where everyone went around telling their story and why they were there. And Ashley said that when she was nine years old, her mother got cancer. And because she had to miss days of work, she was let go and lost her health care. They had to file for bankruptcy, and that's when Ashley decided that she had to do something to help her mom. She knew that food was one of their most expensive costs, and so Ashley convinced her mother that what she really liked and really wanted to eat more than anything else was mustard and relish sandwiches. Because that was the cheapest way to eat. She did this for a year until her mom got better, and she told everyone at the roundtable that the reason she joined our campaign was so that she could help the millions of other children in the country who want and need to help their parents too. Now Ashley might have made a different choice. Perhaps somebody told her along the way that the source of her mother's problems were blacks who were on welfare and too lazy to work, or Hispanics who were coming into the country illegally. But she didn't. She sought out allies in her fight against injustice. Anyway, Ashley finishes her story and then goes around the room and asks everyone else why they're supporting the campaign. They all have different stories and reasons. Many bring up a specific issue. And finally they come to this elderly black man who's been sitting there quietly the entire time. And Ashley asks him why he's there. And he does not bring up a specific issue. He does not say health care or the economy. He does not say education or the war. He does not say that he was there because of Barack Obama. He simply says to everyone in the room, \"I am here because of Ashley.\" \"I'm here because of Ashley.\" By itself, that single moment of recognition between that young white girl and that old black man is not enough. It is not enough to give health care to the sick, or jobs to the jobless, or education to our children. But it is where we start. It is where our union grows stronger. And as so many generations have come to realize over the course of the two-hundred and twenty one years since a band of patriots signed that document in Philadelphia, that is where the perfection begins.",

            "article_content": "The Age of American Unreason is Susan Jacoby's eighth book. She began her writing career as a reporter for the Washington Post.  Jacoby's previous books include the 1984 Pulitzer Prize finalist Wild Justice: The Evolution of Revenge and Freethinkers: A History of American Secularism.\n                \n                    \n                    Chris Ramirez\n                    \n                \nhide caption Book Tour is a Web feature and podcast. Each week, we present leading authors of fiction and nonfiction as they read from and discuss their work. When scholar, blogger and author Susan Jacoby traveled the country to lecture on the history of American secularism, the subject of her 2004 book, Freethinkers, she made an important discovery: Anyone who came out to see her already agreed with her. The idea that no one was willing to hear a contradictory viewpoint \u2014 to see, as she says, \"if the devil has horns\" \u2014 inspired her new work, The Age of American Unreason. The book is about the anti-intellectual, anti-rational strains that Jacoby believes have overtaken our culture. She sees The Age of American Unreason as something of a sequel to historian Richard Hofstadter's 1963 analysis of the American mindset, Anti-Intellectualism in American Life. That book won the Pulitzer Prize for non-fiction. But where Hofstadter, who died in 1970, ends on what Jacoby describes as a \"guardedly optimistic\" note, she writes that \"the scales of American history have shifted heavily against the ... intellectual life so essential to functional democracy.\" Unafraid of laying blame, she offers a harsh indictment of a failing educational system, religious fundamentalism and the American addiction to mass media \u2014 from TV to the Web. Jacoby, who began her career as a Washington Post reporter, describes herself not as a cultural conservative, a term she says has been \"hijacked by the religious right\" to apply to someone \"preoccupied with ... the preservation of the phrase 'under God' in the Pledge of Allegiance.\" Instead, she is a self-described \"cultural conservationist, committed ... to the preservation of the culture 'from destructive influences.'\" The author of eight books, she has written for magazines and newspapers for more than two decades on topics ranging widely from women's rights to Russian literature. She is currently the program director of the Center for Inquiry-New York City, a nonpartisan think tank that promotes science. She also writes a political blog called \"The Secularist's Corner\" on the Washington Post's Web site. The Age of American Unreason offers numerous examples of what Jacoby sees as the debased state of American culture. One for which the author expresses particular disdain is the current use of the word \"folks\" by politicians and pundits. Such casual language, she writes, denies \"the seriousness of whatever ... is being debated.\" Jacoby adds, \"[Franklin] Roosevelt would no more have addressed his fellow citizens as 'folks' than he would have uttered obscenities on the radio. I want him back.\" This reading of The Age of American Unreason took place in February of 2008 at the Politics and Prose bookstore in Washington, D.C. by Susan Jacoby Hardcover, 356 pages | Your purchase helps support NPR programming.

The councils reflect the ethnic makeup of a neighborhood and act as a local government.\n                \n                    \n                    Spencer Platt/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Iraqis vote in an election for a Tribal Support Council in the East Doura district of Baghdad on March 6. The councils reflect the ethnic makeup of a neighborhood and act as a local government. In Iraq, two of the country's main Shiite political parties are locked in a bitter struggle ahead of provincial elections set for early next year. Dawa, the party of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, and the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq are allies at the national level as partners in the ruling coalition in Baghdad. But at the local level, in the Shiite heartland of southern Iraq, competition between the two parties is increasingly fierce \u2014 and local tribal leaders are finding themselves caught in the middle. Empowering The Tribes On one particular day, dozens of men with deeply lined faces framed by checkered headdresses chant in support of their sheik, Nabeel al-Ubadi, the head of the al-Fatla tribe. Ubadi has gathered his people to protest in the southern province of Diwaniyah. \"Last Monday, our house was raided,\" Ubadi says. \"There was no legal reason for it.\" The sheik was hosting a celebration to mark the end of the holy month of Ramadan when six vehicles bearing Iraqi special police forces surrounded the mudhif, or tribal reception hall. Ubadi says they were targeted because he recently joined a tribal support council. Sponsored by Prime Minister Maliki, these newly created councils are made up of members of important tribes across the south. The councils are funded and directed by Maliki's office, and their ostensible aim is to give the tribes a role in maintaining local security and the provision of services. Ubadi says the creation of the councils has caused trouble. \"Those that oppose these tribal councils believe that they are biased, favoring Maliki's Dawa party,\" he says. He and other tribal leaders believe Dawa's main rival, the Supreme Islamic Council of Iraq, was behind the police raid and others that have targeted the tribal councils. The Supreme Council currently controls many of the provincial governments in the south, including the local police forces. Supreme Council leaders have called Maliki's move to establish the tribal councils a blatant attempt to garner votes for the Dawa party. Sheik Mukhles al-Budairi, the deputy head of one the tribal councils, says that a tribe's endorsement of a particular party or candidate can have a huge effect. \"The tribes are the base of society here, and without them no one can get to power,\" Budairi says. And now, he says, the tribes are at the center of the struggle between the two Shiite parties. \"They are trying to provoke us and intimidate us to vote one way or another.\" A Test Of Iraq's Democracy The upcoming provincial elections, tentatively set for the end of January, will be a test of Iraq's nascent democracy. There has already been a rise in the number of political assassinations in the south ahead of the vote, which is a source of concern, says Maj. Gen. Michael Oates. Oates oversees southern Iraq for the U.S. military. \"When the results are announced, some people who currently hold power will no longer hold power,\" Oates says. \"Do they transfer power peacefully, or do the people who were voted out of office decide to hold onto it by other means?\" The Supreme Council was founded in Iran in the early 1980s by Shiites who had fled the oppression of Saddam Hussein's regime. It has extensive funding, vast power in the provinces and maintains close ties with the Iranian government. But it's now being blamed for many of the continuing problems in the south \u2014 the lack of infrastructure, few services and grinding poverty. Maliki's party has been gaining in popularity of late, thanks largely to a string of successful security operations ordered by the prime minister in the south and in Baghdad's Sadr City. With the additional backing of the tribes, Dawa could do very well at the polls. And Supreme Council officials are now demanding that the support councils be disbanded. \"These support councils are illegal and unconstitutional,\" says Abdurrazzaq al-Nasrawi with the Supreme Council in the southern Babil province. \"We do not want the tribes to become politicized.\" Back at the tribal reception hall, the head of the al-Fatla tribe, Ubadi, says he expects more trouble. \"It is an election period, so the rivalry between the two parties is going to increase,\" he says. \"Each side is going to try and win in any way possible.\" He has already made up his mind though \u2014 he will vote for candidates belonging to Maliki's party. And he will tell the members of his tribe to do the same.",

            "article_content": "Pakistani officials are trying to arrange a peace deal with tribal elders in northwest Pakistan. Previous attempts have failed, but there is optimism this time because a Pashtun nationalist party, the ANP, is involved in the negotiations.  STEVE INSKEEP, host: Iraq is not the only place where the future may rest on armed groups with murky allegiances and murky goals. In Pakistan, the government is trying to find a new way to deal with tribal leaders. Those leaders hold great power in the areas near Afghanistan where extremist groups are based. Pakistan's new government is now holding peace talks with tribal elders, and today a Pakistani newspaper reports that talks are moving closer to success. Here's NPR's Philip Reeves. Unidentified Man: (Foreign language spoken) PHILIP REEVES: A line of white-clad men stand side by side in a field. They're praying before a coffin. There have been many funerals around here in recent months on the plains that lead to the Kyber Pass and the mountains that separate Pakistan's untamed western frontier from Afghanistan. The area's been the focus of a suicide bombing campaign by Islamist extremists. Hundreds have died. But this funeral is for a prominent local dignitary who died peacefully. The men look unusually relaxed, despite the scorching sun. The bombings have mostly stopped, at least for now. The Pakistani Taliban's called a ceasefire while peace negotiations go on between the government and tribal elders from Waziristan. Peace agreements have been tried before and failed. This time there's some new players on the scene. Two months ago the Islamist parties who ran the provincial government were kicked out by the electorate and replaced by a Pashtun nationalist party, the ANP. (Soundbite of praying) REEVES: Some of the ANP's senior members are among the mourners today, including Kwaja Mohamed Kahn Harti(ph). Harti says his party knows how to reach out to the tribal militants, not least because the party seeks to champion their ethnicity. Mr. KWAJA MOHAMED KAHN HARTI: He's a Pashtun and I'm a Pashtun. I shall sit down and talk with him. You have to make them believe that we and you are brothers and we are alike and we are a part of each other. REEVES: Political analyst Khalid Aziz(ph) is from the tribal areas and for years worked as a government political agent there. He thinks the election of Pashtun nationalists helps in peacemaking. Mr. KHALID AZIZ (Political Analyst): They have linkages, they understand each other. It makes getting an agreement easier. REEVES: The talks are with elders from the Mesud(ph) tribe in south Waziristan, one of the most hard-line areas. One member of that tribe is Baitullah Mehsud, leader of the Taliban in Pakistan and head of an umbrella group of militants. The CIA and Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf say Baitullah Mehsud was behind the assassination of Benazir Bhutto, although many Pakistanis are unconvinced. The U.S. is worried that if the Taliban and al-Qaida are no longer fighting the Pakistani army, more militants will be able to set off to fight in Afghanistan. They say that's what happened before. The proposed peace deal requires Pakistan's army to pull back from south Waziristan, in return for promises that the tribes will stop attacking the government, throw out foreign militants and end infiltration to Afghanistan. U.S. officials want Pakistan to ensure any agreement it strikes with the tribes produces concrete results. Khalid Aziz, the veteran of the tribal areas, agrees a peace agreement brings some risk. In fact, he thinks it could mean more militants infiltrate into Afghanistan and that they may rearm. But he doesn't believe Pakistan has much choice but to try to find a solution. He says the war with the militants exacted too high a price, severely damaging the Pakistani army's morale and threatening the stability of the entire country. Mr. AZIZ: So the equation that is coming up is whether you give more credence to protection of the larger interests of war on terror or to look after survival within Pakistan. Because if you lose the structures within Pakistan, there won't be anything left to protect. REEVES: Aziz believes the problem in the tribal areas is profound poverty. He says it's time for fundamental reforms, though it's hard to understand the enormity of that task. But that's a way off. In the meantime, the U.S.'s position has become more complicated. Before, when Musharraf was in direct charge of Pakistan's government and the military, Washington knew whom to pressure. Now it must deal with a fragile coalition government and a separate army chief. Hamid Dullah Jan Alfreedi(ph) is a government minister and from the tribal areas. He thinks it's time for the U.S. to back off. Philip Reeves, NPR News, Islamabad. Copyright \u00a9 2008 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "It will be weeks before the Democratic presidential nominee is decided, and that time lag is hurting the party. The battle between Sens. Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama seems to get nastier every day. Meantime, the immigration debate haunts McCain and the GOP.  STEVE INSKEEP, Host: Good morning to you both. KEN RUDIN: Good morning. MARA LIASSON: Good morning, Steve. INSKEEP: How big a problem is it for Republicans if McCain has a very different position on immigration than many of the candidates he's running with? LIASSON: But the fact is that the standard bearer of the Republican Party is the sponsor of the infamous McCain/Kennedy bill. Everybody does know where he stands and he is, for that very reason, the strongest Republican to contest the Democrats with the Hispanic vote and in a lot of parts of the country where an anti- immigration candidate could not. INSKEEP: Ken Rudin. RUDIN: But don't forget that last month at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington, John McCain was booed by the conservative delegates there when he mentioned his role in the immigration debate. So before he woos these Independents in November, the hopes to break up, you know, the Democratic coalition, he's going to have to assemble a Republican coalition. LIASSON: Yeah, I agree with that. But the fact that the Republicans did lose Denny Hastert's seat and it was quite a shock to them. Newt Gingrich called it a loss of Watergate-style proportions in the outlook that it suggests for the fall, I think people might be - Republicans might be more open to what McCain has to offer. INSKEEP: Do you think that Republicans have a chance to do well in the Hispanic vote, better than they did in 2006 anyway? RUDIN: Well, I think they do, only because John McCain has made that an important part of his candidacy. He's - similar to what George W. Bush did when he was governor of Texas. He reached out for Hispanic support and got it in both 2000 and 2004. INSKEEP: Well, let's move on to the other side here. We should mention that whatever awkwardness McCain has, he's free enough anyway to leave the country. He was seen in Iraq over the weekend. Democrats have a different situation, don't they? RUDIN: The battle between Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama does not seem to be lessening at all. The personal attacks seem to be going up. And while Barack Obama seems to be gaining delegates - this weekend, Saturday, the county conventions in Iowa, he picked up another nine or ten delegates, moving him ever closer to 2,025. But nobody seems to be reaching the magic number. And then therefore the wooing of the superdelegates begins. (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER) LIASSON: Yeah, and that's why Michigan and Florida, those contested primaries - that everybody's talking about a possible do over there - are so much more important to Hillary Clinton. Every day that Barack Obama picks up another Edwards delegate, as Ken talked about in Iowa, or another superdelegate makes it more important that she somehow find a way to get those primaries redone in Michigan and Florida so she can pick up - add to her popular vote totals and pick up some delegates. INSKEEP: Can I just mention, both of these candidates have insisted that race is not an issue, is not supposed to be an issue here. But last week we had a supporter of Hillary Clinton, Geraldine Ferraro, having to disassociate herself from the campaign after some remarks on race. And now it seems to be Barack Obama's turn to be in trouble on some racial issues. LIASSON: Race is definitely an issue in this campaign. Of course, both candidates say they don't want it to be, especially Barack Obama, who has really run to transcend racial divisions. But you do see a very strong racial divide in the primary results. Something that Hillary Clinton, in an indirect way, says is one of the reasons why Barack Obama would not be as good a general election candidate because he can't carry those working class white votes.

Months ago, pundits wondered whether white working-class voters in Ohio would support an African-American candidate.  RENEE MONTAGNE, Host: Now here's a bit of the scene last night from Democratic headquarters in the state of Ohio from NPR's David Greene. DAVID GREENE: When Governor Ted Strickland came onstage to celebrate Obama's victory, he had this to say. (SOUNDBITE OF CELEBRATION AT DEMOCRATIC HEADQUARTERS, OHIO) MONTAGNE: Ohio is a welcoming state. America is an inclusive country. (SOUNDBITE OF APPLAUSE) GREENE: Remember back in March? That's when Obama lost the Ohio primary, and the pundits wondered whether white, working-class voters here would go for an African-American candidate. Jill Mercer(ph) is an attorney who grew up in the Appalachian region of Ohio. She said she had her doubts about how Obama would do. MONTAGNE: That's something that kind of concerned me, was the racism issue. And I mean, even, you know, talking to friends and family down there and kind of what the attitude was, I mean, there certainly was that buzz going around. GREENE: Maybe there's racism left in pockets of Ohio. Jill said enough voters just put other issues first. MONTAGNE: You know, they're getting foreclosed on, they're losing jobs and everything else. And people just wanted something different. GREENE: Jill was celebrating in the hotel ballroom here. Just steps away was a woman named Judy Reed(ph) who works for Ohio's state government. Judy was soaking up the symbolism. MONTAGNE: This man represents us, you know. He represents us as a people. He's - a white mom, a black father. That's a beautiful thing. It's us. It's you and me, you know what I mean? So it feels good. It's beautiful. Don't you think? (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER) GREENE: David Greene, NPR News, Columbus. Copyright \u00a9 2008 NPR.

            "article_content": "Democratic presidential hopeful Barack Obama made his case to voters Wednesday in the battleground state of Virginia. He brushed off rival John McCain's accusations that his tax plan amounts to socialism. It was his last full day of campaigning before taking time out to head to Hawaii to visit his ailing grandmother.  RENEE MONTAGNE, host: Democratic candidate Barack Obama spent much of his day responding to the criticisms from the Republican ticket. Obama made his case to voters in rallies in the battleground state of Virginia. It was his last full day of campaigning before taking time out to head to Hawaii this afternoon to visit his sick grandmother. NPR's Audie Cornish reports. AUDIE CORNISH: The Democratic nominee drew some 35,000 people to an evening rally in Leesburg, Virginia. The city's in that voter-rich and Democratic-leaning section of the state that's often considered suburban Washington, D.C. A McCain campaign spokeswoman recently dismissed the area as not real Virginia. Voter and Loudoun County firefighter Karrie Boswell very much disagrees. Ms. KARRIE BOSWELL (Firefighter, Loudoun County, Virginia): Yeah, it is - it is real America. That's what I think. Yeah, this is it. This is what - you look at the trends and what's happening and what people's expectations are of their candidates. Yeah, I think it is a true snapshot of what's going on in this country. CORNISH: And Senator Barack Obama swooped in to the battleground state to take advantage of the perceived misstep. (Soundbite of Democratic campaign rally, Virginia) Senator BARACK OBAMA (Democrat, Illinois; Democratic Presidential Candidate): On this beautiful fall day, it is good to be back in Virginia. (Soundbite of crowd ovation) Senator OBAMA: I know some folks may not think so, but this looks like the real Virginia to me. (Soundbite of crowd ovation) CORNISH: John McCain may be embracing the role of underdog, but Barack Obama says he's too superstitious to embrace frontrunner status. The Democratic nominee warns voters at every turn of Republican attacks. Senator OBAMA: We've seen it before, and we're seeing it right now. The ugly phone calls, the misleading mail and TV ads, the careless, outrageous comments, the constant negativity, all aimed at keeping us from working together, all aimed at stopping change. CORNISH: And then, point by point, he takes them on. For instance, in response to Governor Sarah Palin's comments about so-called pro-American areas of the country, Obama says... Senator OBAMA: There are no real or fake parts of this country. (Soundbite of crowd ovation) Senator OBAMA: We're not separated by the pro-America and anti-America parts of this country. (Soundbite of crowd ovation) Senator OBAMA: We all love this country no matter where we live or where we come from. CORNISH: And when John McCain goes after Obama's tax platform, Obama counters... Senator OBAMA: John McCain has called my tax plans socialistic. That's what he said. And here's the irony. Back in 2000, back in 2000 John McCain himself opposed the Bush tax cuts on the very wealthiest. CORNISH: The senator even manages to throw in a rebuttal to the McCain camp's favorite voter, Joe the Plumber. Senator OBAMA: All I want to do is give Joe a tax cut. (Soundbite of crow ovation) Senator OBAMA: That's all I want to do. So let's be clear about who John McCain's fighting for. He's not fighting for Joe the Plumber. He's fighting for Joe the Hedge Fund Manager. CORNISH: Senator Obama does work in some key domestic policy points in between the digs. The Democrat reiterates his call for a federal economic stimulus package for families. He proposes a tax credit for each new employee a company hires on American soil over the next two years. And Obama promises a three-month moratorium on home foreclosures, and more. But will it be enough for the undecided voters like Leesburg town administrator Scott Parker? Mr. SCOTT PARKER (Administrator, Leesburg Town): I think I've heard a lot of it before - taxes, health care, education - we've heard it for years, we've heard it for years from both sides. And there's a lot of cynical people out there. There's a lot of skeptical people out there. CORNISH: Which may be why Virginia is still very much a tossup state. Audie Cornish, NPR News, traveling with the Obama campaign. MONTAGNE: Here's something the candidates rarely mention but that's apparent every day. One of the major party nominees is black. Win or lose, Barack Obama has sparked widespread conversation about race, which we're sampling at NPR News. INSKEEP: Tomorrow we resume our talks with voters in York, Pennsylvania. In that swing state, campaign ads show Obama's white relatives. (Soundbite of interview with voters in York, Pennsylvania) Unidentified Man #1: When you talk about a Barack Obama who they show you these pictures of his family and who he grew up with, what it's basically saying to the American people is, don't worry. You don't have to worry about him doing these things that you might think he might do that comes from this African-American culture. MONTAGNE: And then there's the voter that Republican Sarah Palin has described. INSKEEP: When you hear the phrase Joe Six-pack, who is that? Who do you imagine? Unidentified Man #2: Common, everyday, working man. Unidentified Woman: When I hear Joe Six-pack, I think of the hunter and his gun. And that's a definite white man out in the countryside. INSKEEP: I'll join Michele Norris of NPR's All Things Considered and a roomful of voters in York, Pennsylvania, and we will dissect race in this election tomorrow morning and afternoon.

            "article_content": "Democratic presidential hopeful Barack Obama is on a two-day swing through Florida, which voted for President Bush in 2004. Obama got some campaign help Monday from members of the Tampa Bay Rays, who hours before clinched their first trip to the World Series, and later from former rival Hillary Clinton.  RENEE MONTAGNE, host: This is Morning Edition from NPR News. I'm Renee Montagne. Barack Obama and John McCain are hunting for votes in big, battleground states. Lately, it seems they've been tracing each other's paths across the electoral map. Yesterday, they focused on a pair of states that have gone Republican twice in a row. McCain was in Missouri; Obama was in Florida. We have two reports, first with Don Gonyea traveling with the Obama campaign. DON GONYEA: Barack Obama held two events in the hotly contested Sunshine State Monday. At each, there was a very special guest or more. In Tampa, the town has baseball fever. Barely 12 hours earlier, the once-lowly Tampa Bay Rays had clinched a trip to their first World Series. So how do you get crazed fans to think about politics on the morning after? Well, you hold the rally on a baseball diamond and... (Soundbite of Democratic campaign rally in Tampa, Florida) Unidentified Announcer: To introduce the next president of the United States, please welcome American League champs: the Tampa Bay Rays. (Soundbite of crowd ovation) GONYEA: Six members of the team took to the stage, including star outfielder Fernando Perez, who made a pitch for early voting, which started yesterday in Florida. (Soundbite of Democratic campaign rally in Tampa, Florida) Mr. FERNANDO PEREZ (Baseball Player, Tampa Bay Rays): Barack Obama can win this election. (Soundbite of crowd ovation) Mr. PEREZ: But he can't do it without your help. GONYEA: Obama made his entrance, exchanging hugs and high fives with the players. (Soundbite of Democratic campaign rally in Tampa, Florida) Senator BARACK OBAMA (Democrat, Arizona; Democratic Presidential Candidate): So when you see a White Sox fan showing love to the Rays, and the Rays showing some love back, you know we're onto something right here. GONYEA: Later in the day, it was another rally at twilight with 50,000 people in Orlando. The guest this time? (Soundbite of Democratic campaign rally in Orlando, Florida) Senator HILLARY CLINTON (Democrat, New York): Thank you. Thank you, Orlando. GONYEA: Senator Hillary Clinton, making her first joint appearance with Obama since July. During the primaries, Clinton was very popular among working-class voters and senior citizens. Florida has lots of each. She reached out to those who once backed her candidacy. (Soundbite of Democratic campaign rally in Orlando, Florida) Senator CLINTON: If you made phone calls for me, make them for Barack. If you walked streets for me, make them for Barack. If you talked to your friends and your neighbors, do it again for Barack. We cannot risk four more years of the same failed Republican policies. GONYEA: Today, Obama continues to work Florida with events in Palm Beach and Miami. Don Gonyea, NPR News. Copyright \u00a9 2008 NPR.  All rights reserved.

John McCain reaches out to supporters during a rally in Blue Bell, Pa., on Oct. 14, 2008, where he sought to retake the election initiative with his latest economic plan.\n                \n                    \n                    Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Sen. John McCain reaches out to supporters during a rally in Blue Bell, Pa., on Oct. 14, 2008, where he sought to retake the election initiative with his latest economic plan. John McCain has been struggling to find his footing on the shifting sands of the United States economy. With just three weeks left before the election, McCain is trailing Barack Obama \u2014 who is more trusted on economic issues. But as McCain told supporters in Blue Bell, Pa., today, a lot can happen in 21 days, in politics and in business. \"Over the last 21 days, we have seen once-sturdy Wall Street institutions vanish, we have seen huge swings in the market both down and up, and we have seen new federal commitments in the hundreds of billions of dollars,\" McCain said. \"We have seen how suddenly a crisis can unfold these last several weeks, and how great the costs can be in jobs, savings, lost opportunities and taxpayer dollars.\" McCain's Platform McCain added several new wrinkles today to his basic economic platform of low taxes and reduced government spending.  They're aimed primarily at investors with substantial assets and designed to build confidence in the nation's financial system.  Together the proposals would cost the government about $50 billion. The bulk of that cost would be in the form of a tax break to seniors in higher tax brackets who withdraw money from retirement accounts. McCain wants to tax those withdrawals at the lowest rate of 10 percent to help offset the pain of recent stock market declines. \"Retirees have suffered enough and need relief,\" he said. McCain also proposed a temporary cut in the capital-gains-tax rate, which he says would prompt more people to buy stocks.  He contrasted his plan with one that would let cash-strapped workers tap their retirement plans without a penalty \u2014 an idea that was floated yesterday by Obama. \"This is an invitation to capital flight, and therefore to continued instability in the market, at a moment when exactly the opposite is needed,\" McCain said. Potential Flaws While McCain's plan is designed to encourage investment, it could backfire with a wave of stock sales two years from now, unless the temporary tax cut is made permanent. That would substantially increase the cost of the plan to the government. Obama's allies complain that McCain's proposals are tilted toward the wealthiest Americans and offer little help for working-class families and those who don't own stock. Under McCain's plan, wealthy savers with more than a quarter-million dollars in the bank would enjoy a six-month government guarantee on their deposits. At the other end of the spectrum, McCain agrees with Obama that workers who have lost jobs shouldn't have to pay taxes on their unemployment benefits.",

            "article_content": "The tax proposals of presidential hopefuls John McCain and Barack Obama are markedly different. So NPR asked Roberton Williams of the Tax Policy Center to assess the financial situations of three voters from different income levels to see how their taxes would change under each plan. The voters then spoke with NPR's Andrea Seabrook about their reactions to the candidates' proposals. Marilyn Lyons, pictured here with her husband, Bill, lives in Stockton, Mo. She works as a forklift driver on the night shift and also has a part-time job, which means she usually sleeps between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. Her latest paycheck was for $263 \u2014 she makes $8.04 an hour, or approximately $16,000 a year. Under McCain's plan, Lyons' taxes wouldn't change because she has no children or dependents. Obama's plan, however, would save her about $2,300. \"That sounds pretty darn good, if it actually works,\" Lyons said. She said it seems that no matter how much is taken out of her paycheck in taxes, she ends up paying even more at the end of the year. \"Ten dollars extra a week taken out of my paycheck, and I still end up having to pay,\" Lyons said. \"Well I already gave them plenty, I think.\" But she said she is concerned about a tax increase on businesses, because the company she works for is uncertain about its future. \"The more companies that have to shut down, the more people that are out there without jobs,\" Lyons said. \"And that's not going to help the economy a bit.\" Adam Terio lives in Reston, Va., with his wife and 2-year-old son. He is a civilian engineer for the Army and makes about $100,000 a year. The candidates' tax plans would have nearly identical effects on Terio: McCain's would save him about $900, and Obama's about $1,000. \"When I look at the two candidates, I don't really see that anything that they're going to offer would have drastically changed my financial situation one way or the other,\" Terio said. \"I assumed that being in the middle class, I would probably do well under either of them.\" Terio said he is comfortable with the amount of taxes he currently pays, and while he wouldn't be happy if his taxes were raised, he would understand. \"We've got two wars going on; we've got this $700 billion plan to save the economy,\" he said. \"And I would understand if somebody told me, 'We can't cut your taxes right now because we've got all this stuff to deal with,' and we have people like Marilyn [Lyons], who obviously are much more in need of this than I am.\" Kevin Childress owns a natural gas exploration and production company in Kansas City, Mo. He has a wife and two children, and his is the sole income in his household. Last year, he had between $500,000 and $550,000 in taxable income, though he said \"a significant amount of that was reinvested in my business and didn't come home.\" Under McCain's tax plan, Childress' taxes would stay the same; under Obama's, he would pay approximately $3,700 more a year. Childress said he is concerned about the effects of a tax increase. \"I paid approximately $200,000 in federal income taxes last year, and that seems like enough to me,\" he said. \"The 5 percent of us on whom the taxes will be raised in order to fund the Obama plan are already paying about 60 percent of the federal income tax burden.\" Childress said his business is already showing signs of slowing and that increased taxes would force him to make some difficult decisions. \"Primarily, it will either slow down or stop growth plans or it will cause us to contract somewhat,\" he said. \"We've seen the price of our natural gas product collapse by about 60 percent in the last three months. Adding to that an increased tax burden will inhibit me from hiring new people or taking on new projects, and that's already starting to happen right now.\"",

            "article_content": "Democrat Barack Obama has wrapped up a tour of smaller cities in Ohio, telling big crowds the Bush administration bears responsibility for the mortgage meltdown and financial crisis. He has said Republican John McCain represents more of the same.  ROBERT SIEGEL, host: Barack Obama spent time this week in states that he failed to win in the primaries. Places like Indiana and Ohio where many white working class voters did not back him. Well now with less than four weeks to Election Day, many of those voters are showing up at Obama rallies. NPR's David Greene chatted with some of them as he followed the Democratic nominee. DAVID GREENE: Obama gave his stump speech this week at the muddy Indiana State Fairgrounds.  This is where I met James Thompson. He'd been listening to Obama from a distance away from the crowd.  He handed me his business card through a fence. Mr. JAMES THOMPSON: Well, I'm a handyman. GREENE: Turns out, a self-employed handyman. Mr. THOMPSON: I assist the do-it-yourselfer. I tried to create a recession-proof business about eight years ago. And it's working. GREENE: For people who are doing like working on their houses and stuff like that... Mr. THOMPSON: Yes, I help them. GREENE: James is 49 and as a handyman in Indiana, he's the kind of voter Obama struggled to connect with earlier this year. But James says he'll vote for Obama. He says it's been touching to hear Obama talk about his mom and her losing battle with ovarian cancer. Mr. THOMPSON: I mean, my father died when I was young and so that kind of gives me more - I feel he's of that cloth that I'm from, man.  You know, I feel like I connect with that.  I can't connect with John McCain.  That's why we're here today. GREENE: If Obama can keep getting people like James on board, it could bode well for the Democrat.  And as people have become more worried about the economy, Obama's turned more personal, talking about his mom, his family and about how he feels like the product of an American dream that he wants to protect. Senator BARACK OBAMA (Democratic Presidential Nominee): Thank you. It is good to be back in Dayton. GREENE: He spent time this week in Indiana and then Ohio, both red states and both states he lost in the primaries. Senator OBAMA: We're going to win this election and you and I together, we're going to change this country and change the world. Thank you everybody. God bless you and God bless... GREENE: Obama says he's superstitious. He avoids phrases like when I'm president as if to say I'm not there yet. (Soundbite of song \"Signed, Sealed, Delivered\") Mr. STEVIE WONDER: (Singing) Here I am, signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours. GREENE: OK. That song does end every event. But to be fair, the campaign has been using it for months, including at a rally this week in Dayton where I met Larry Spanky(ph). He is a carpenter. Mr. LARRY SPANKY (Carpenter):  Well, at the moment, I'm laid off but I'm expecting to start work another week or two as... GREENE: Larry voted for John Edwards back during the primaries. But now he's an Obama guy. He says he's over the talk about Obama not connecting with working people. Mr. SPANKY: I think it was a bunch of baloney, really. I think that they were talking down to people and I think that most people would prefer to have somebody that is intelligent, that can speak... GREENE: As for the elitist label some give to Obama... Mr. SPANKY: The people talk about him being elite, but you know, who wants a president that isn't elite?  We want to have elite military forces, we want to have elite athletes, you know, I think we really need to have an elite president. Senator OBAMA: How are you? What's your name?  Holly? HOLLY: That's me. Senator OBAMA: Good to see you. I am going to have a piece of coconut cream pie. GREENE: Yesterday Obama made a pit stop at a diner in Georgetown, Ohio and reality intervened.  One customer Terry Hunley was finishing her fried shrimp and french fries when Obama came to shake her hand. She smiled. Snapped photos of Obama on her cell phone. As for voting for him... Ms. TERRY HUNLEY: No. Probably not. GREENE: Why not? Ms. HUNLEY: Well, I don't know why. I'd rather not say, just, I'm a McCain fan. GREENE: A few more handshakes later, Obama was on his way again to his next stop an hour up the road.  David Greene, NPR News traveling with the Obama campaign. Copyright \u00a9 2008 NPR.

A top U.S. labor leader is making an unusually blunt pitch to working-class white voters in key battleground states. Longtime United Mine Workers President Richard Trumka, who is now secretary-treasurer of the AFL-CIO, is making the case for Sen. Barack Obama. For the past several months, Trumka, 59, has been giving speeches on the issue of race and the presidential election. It's a reaction to racist comments he has personally encountered. In an interview, he said he felt compelled to personally challenge anyone in the labor movement who may not vote for Obama because he is black. Obama's status as the first African-American ever to win a major party presidential nomination means race has taken on a prominent role this year. That said, it's still rare to hear the topic confronted quite so directly as Trumka has. An Impassioned Speech In a speech before the national convention of the United Steelworkers in Las Vegas in July, an emotional Trumka said, \"We can't tap dance around the fact that there are a lot of white folks out there\" \u2014 a lot of them are good union people, he added \u2014 who \"just can't get past this idea that there's something wrong with voting for a black man.\" In the speech, Trumka went on to say that while there are many reasons to vote for Obama, there's \"only one really, really bad reason to vote against Barack Obama. And that's because he's not white.\" A recording of that speech has been widely circulated, thanks to YouTube. Since then, Trumka has repeated it at union halls around the country. Trumka is white. Asked why he is giving this speech, he told the story of a conversation he had the day of the Pennsylvania primary in his hometown of Nemacolin in the southwest corner of the state. \"This woman walks up to me. I'd known her for a long time,  and I ask her 'Have you decided who you gonna vote for?' \" \"There's no way I'd ever vote for Barack Obama,\" the woman responded. Trumka said he pressed her as to why. First, she said it's because Obama is \"a Muslim.\" Trumka responded that Obama is actually a Christian. Then, she told him Obama never wears an American flag pin on his lapel. Trumka told her that, too, is false, then asked her why she wasn't wearing one if that is such an important issue. Trumka said he continued to push, until \"her eyes dropped down and she said to me, 'Well, he's a black man.' \" Trumka said he told her to look around at their town, the mining community where they both had lived for so long. \"And I said to her, 'This town is dying \u2014 literally dying.' \" It's a line that he includes, verbatim, whenever he delivers his speech. \"Our kids are moving away because there's no future here,\" Trumka said in the United Steelworkers convention address. \"And here's a man, Barack Obama, who's going to fight for people like us, and you won't vote for him because of the color of his skin? Are you out of your ever-loving mind?\" The audience erupted in applause. Labor's Civil Rights Role Confronting this, Trumka said, is labor's responsibility \"because we know, better than anyone else, how racism is used to divide working people.\" Trumka pointed out that this is hardly new territory for the labor movement. In the 1960s, United Auto Workers President Walter Reuther and others in organized labor marched with the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. Trumka also pointed out that labor was deeply involved, through boycotts and educational activity, in the effort to end the era of apartheid in South Africa. In Cleveland, Trumka stopped by a hulking steel mill not far from the union hall. The plant was down while undergoing regular repairs and maintenance of the giant machines that roll out hot sheets of steel. The plant visitor dropped into the lunchroom, better known as the \"fishbowl\" in the parlance of the mill. After a brief pitch for votes for Obama, there was time for some questions before the lunch hour ended. On this day, the topic of race did not come up. It doesn't come up every time Trumka speaks to a group of workers. This time he was asked why the union isn't supporting Republican John McCain, since the husband of Sarah Palin is a member of the Steelworkers Union in Alaska. Trumka had a ready reply: \"McCain and all of his policies are bad for us.\" But the questioner, 50-year-old Dave Moeller, persisted, switching to another topic: abortion. He said Obama, a supporter of abortion rights, wants to keep babies from being born. Trumka disagreed with the characterization. Then Moeller switched topics again, to an issue near and dear to many blue-collar Americans. \"We don't need our guns taken away, either, but he [Obama] wants to do that,\" Moeller said. Trumka shot back, \"That's not true. That's absolutely not true. He believes in the Second Amendment. He has a better position than John McCain.\" Then, to bolster his credibility on the topic, Trumka added, \"And by the way, I'm a sportsman.\" After a few minutes of that, everyone shook hands. Trumka headed outside. He said such encounters are valuable, whether the discussion is guns or something like abortion, which also comes up frequently \u2014 or Obama's race. \"Personally, I enjoy that kind of stuff,\" Trumka said. \"I mean, you never get a chance to find out what's on people's mind if they don't talk to you. So those kind of interchanges are really helpful. And it's actually what it's all about.\" From there, Trumka headed to a union-operated phone bank at the United Food and Commercial Workers local on Euclid Avenue in downtown Cleveland. About a dozen volunteers called union members to encourage them to vote for Obama. Among those at the union hall was Graylon Keeton, a Cleveland municipal worker and member of the Amalgamated Transit Union Local 28. The 58-year-old Keeton, who is African-American, walked up to Trumka and thanked him for the speech he has been giving to union audiences. \"I've got a copy of it at my house,\" he told Trumka. Keeton says Trumka is doing a great thing this election. Race, Keeton says, \"is the big elephant in the room. It's there, but nobody wants to see it. But you have to.\"",

Like many towns across the country, Uniontown, Pa., is struggling through tough economic times. The voters there have historically been friendly to Democrats, but Sen. Barack Obama faces some challenges in this part of the swing state \u2014 Sen. Hillary Clinton won nearly 80 percent of Fayette County's vote in the Democratic primary, and a recent Time magazine poll shows Republican Sen. John McCain with a 20-point lead among white male voters nationwide. Fayette County is the area of Pennsylvania that once powered the steel industry. Coal was taken from the ground in places like Uniontown and then burned into fuel. Sam Wood, 84, worked in those now defunct coal mines. \"You couldn't see the stars at night,\" he recalls. \"All you saw was red sky.\" Nowadays, Wood sells ears of sweet corn by the roadside in Uniontown. They're so sweet that customers can eat them uncooked while Wood talks about things like the election. \"I think our country's in bad shape,\" he says. \"See, I remember the other Depression. I was only about 8 years old, but I got a good memory. We always had a man for the time when this country was in bad shape. I don't see any now.\" Wood says he has thought about McCain but is unsure about him. \"Now, I like his vice president. Not because she's good looking, but I think she's got a lot of common sense,\" Wood says. \"And you know what? She don't owe anybody anything in D.C.\" Although he is a registered Democrat, Wood says he'll vote for the Republican ticket. He says Obama hasn't impressed him much and that it was Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin who really made the difference in his choice. Rich Miner pulls up to the corn stand. He says he has thought long and hard about the election. Miner, 68, works for the local sewage authority and voted for Hillary Clinton in the primary. These days, he says, he looks at McCain and sees a carbon copy of President Bush, which he doesn't like. \"Obama? I guess we take a chance on him. He's a rookie. But he sounds good,\" Miner says. But this isn't an easy decision for him. He says there was a time he might not have supported a black candidate. \"I myself was one time very prejudiced,\" Miner says. \"But I ain't no more. I just changed my attitude. I've always been around colored people. I work with them. I've always worked with them, and I found early on that blacks sort of took advantage of the situation. I don't know, anymore \u2014 I think they're OK as long as they do their end of the job. I don't see nothing wrong with that.\" Miner says he's optimistic about the job Obama would do as president. \"He sounds like he's working for the middle-class people,\" Miner says. \"That's where he comes from. Hopefully he'll do us some good.\" Industries and businesses come and go in this part of Pennsylvania, but Fayette Engineering has hung on. Russell Mechling Jr. recently retired after 46 years as president of the company, and he says although he's voting for Barack Obama, he doesn't go around boasting about it. \"You know it's a little hard when you think about back in the primary, when 80 percent of your neighbors didn't vote for him, to go around telling people, 'You made a big mistake, you should have voted for him,' \" Mechling says. But he says there's another reason he's careful to not be too vocal about his support. \"You know, there still seems to be the race issue. Nobody admits it \u2014 nobody. ... But I think there is a racial component there,\" he says. \"It's there. And it shouldn't be.\" Mechling says he hopes people take a look at the other differences between Obama and McCain. \"I think there are people who've been telling themselves, and telling their friends and neighbors, they just wouldn't vote for Obama, who are thinking now that, wait a minute \u2014 given the choice they may vote for Obama,\" he says. \"I think he may do better in Fayette County than you may have expected.\" Democratic candidates are used to doing well there. Bill Clinton, Al Gore and John Kerry all won Fayette County in their respective presidential election years, and Barack Obama hopes to add his name to that list.",

            "article_content": "Read about the poll that shows Barack Obama and John McCain in a dead heat in swing states \u2014 and which kind of voters they're going after. In Colorado, where Republicans have carried the past two presidential elections, a new poll shows Democratic Sen. Barack Obama edging rival Sen. John McCain by four percentage points. Of the more than 1,400 likely voters surveyed for the Quinnipiac University/Wall Street Journal poll 49 percent preferred Obama, compared with 45 percent for McCain. One reason for the Illinois senator's lead is his appeal among Colorado's Hispanic voters. The poll, released Sept. 23, showed support for Obama among this group at 68 percent to McCain's 26 percent. Two key Hispanic politicians have been out trying to muster support in the swing state for their respective candidates. The Democratic Campaign Last Sunday afternoon, as the Denver Broncos were barely surviving the passing attack of the New Orleans Saints, a local political star returned to the ground game of political campaigning. Former Cabinet Secretary Federico Pena, Denver's first Hispanic mayor, was out knocking on doors in the working class, mostly Hispanic neighborhood he used to represent. Pena found a startling variety of responses. At one door, there was an enthusiastic greeting; at another just barking dogs. One homeowner engrossed in watching the Broncos game told the former mayor in no uncertain terms to \"f*** off.\" There were also many who were indifferent or caught feeling guilty because they weren't registered to vote. Through it all, Pena retained the cheery air of a politic pro. His canvassing team helped those who weren't registered  fill out applications. They also distributed several applications for absentee ballots. Twenty percent of Colorado's population is Hispanic, and most of them typically vote Democrat. But Hispanic turnout is usually low, so the \"get out the vote\" effort is crucial. And most Coloradoans are expected to vote early by mail this year, so it's vital to get out applications for mail-in ballots. Historically, that has been a Republican strong suit, but Democrats are narrowing the gap this year. In a conference room at his investment firm in downtown Denver, Pena said the major issues for Hispanics are the same as for everyone else, except for one: immigration. He says the immigration debate and immigration crackdowns have made many Latino citizens feel they have been discriminated against. \"That's an issue that is slightly below the surface, but it's resonating when it comes to Barack Obama vs. Sen. McCain, because people see Sen. McCain has abandoned his position on immigration,\" Pena says. \"[McCain's] conversion to the right wing of the Republican party has now aligned him with the very negative rhetoric of many of the members of his party and the anti-immigrant forces. And that has gotten out to Latinos around the country, and that's why Sen. McCain is doing poorly with Latinos around the United States.\" In order for Democrats to carry Colorado, Pena says, they have to win big in Denver. They also have to win or run even in the swing counties outside the city, and they have to run in the high 30s or low 40s in GOP strongholds. \"The one unknown here is voter turnout,\" Pena says. \"Four years ago, we had a very large voter turnout in Colorado. I predict this year we will beat that record. The other unpredictable is the youth vote. We're going to have an extraordinary youth vote. We've registered many, many people under the radar screen. Those two factors have not been polled \u2014 by either the state polls or the national polls \u2014 and that's, I think, the silver lining in our campaign.\" The Republican Campaign Former state Sen. Larry Trujillo, a Democratic officeholder turned Republican activist, has driven more than 100 miles from his home near Pueblo to visit the town of Monte Vista, about four hours southwest of Denver. From the motel rooms at Kelloff's Best Western Movie Manor, customers can watch a movie through the windows on a giant screen outside. But Trujillo hasn't come to see a movie. He has come to distribute yard signs and bumper stickers to a dozen Republican activists from the San Luis Valley. Local Republicans express enthusiasm about McCain's choice of running mate, Sarah Palin, but seem frustrated by what they see as a slow start to the campaign effort in Colorado. \"Where have you been?\" one man asks. \"Where has the McCain campaign been?\" In the meeting room at Kelloff's Restaurant, with a spectacular view of the San Juan Mountains behind him, Trujillo talks to the local leaders \u2014 several of whom are Hispanic, like him. This is an old crowd. Trujillo introduces Rudolfo Silver Jaramillo, a retired county school supervisor who was a pilot in World War II. \"As a World War II veteran, and seeing what a concentration camp was all about in Weimar, Germany, and knowing what the next president, McCain, went through, makes me say that every veteran in the United States is committed to voting for him for what he went through for his country,\" Jaramillo says. There are Colorado veterans who are vehemently opposed to McCain for voting against some Veterans Affairs spending, but the appeal to patriotism goes a long way with a group that has a strong history of military service. At the McCain campaign office in Colorado Springs, one of 10 in the state, Trujillo talks about the Arizona senator's appeal in Colorado. (The Obama campaign has 26 offices throughout the state). \"McCain, I think, wanted to have good strong borders, but also have a work program to allow people to come in, be identified and then go back,\" Trujillo says. \"And I think that's a plus-plus for McCain in Colorado.\" Although Colorado Republicans assume they will lose the Hispanic vote, the question is by how much. \"I think you've got to get at least 25 percent of the Latino vote to do good,\" Trujillo says. \"I think McCain will surpass that.\" It looks like it's going to be close in Colorado.",

            "article_content": "As Wall Street continued to be rocked by turmoil, the presidential candidates touted economic reforms to voters. Republican John McCain, campaigning in the battleground state of Michigan, told a crowd there he would fight for working people.  RENEE MONTAGNE, Host: We go now to the presidential campaign, to where the nation's faltering economy was inevitably the main topic of the day. Both Barack Obama and John McCain styled themselves as champions of the worker yesterday, and distanced themselves from policies that may have brought on the current crisis. We have two reports form the campaign trail, first NPR's David Greene traveling with the McCain campaign in the hotly contested state of Michigan. DAVID GREENE: As soon as John McCain landed in Michigan yesterday, he headed for a GM plant outside Detroit. (SOUNDBITE OF JOHN MCCAIN SPEAKING BEFORE GM WORKERS IN DETROIT) JOHN MCCAIN: I'm here to send a message to Washington and to Wall Street. We're not going to leave the workers here in Michigan hung out to dry while we give billions in taxpayers' dollars to Wall Street. We're going to take care of the workers. The workers, they are the ones that deserve our help. (SOUNDBITE OF APPLAUSE) GREENE: As the focus of the campaign has turned to the economy, McCain's been sounding like a populist who knows how to connect with people and fight for them. McCain appeared alone at the GM plant, but by the time he arrived last night in Grand Rapids, he'd brought in some backup. (SOUNDBITE OF REPUBLICAN TOWN HALL MEETING IN GRAND RAPIDS, MICHIGAN) MCCAIN: ...the next vice president of the United States, Sarah Palin. (SOUNDBITE OF CROWD OVATION) SARAH PALIN: Thank you. Michigan, thank you so much. GREENE: The two candidates were holding a town hall meeting together, and once again, Palin took center stage as she told the audience about her time as mayor of Wasilla, Alaska. (SOUNDBITE OF REPUBLICAN TOWN HALL MEETING IN GRAND RAPIDS, MICHIGAN) PALIN: What I focused on, first on a local level, was getting into a community that I had grown up in, a small town - and there's nothing wrong with small towns... (SOUNDBITE OF CROWD OVATION) GREENE: For one thing, Palin said, her small town taught her the importance of cutting taxes to attract investment. (SOUNDBITE OF REPUBLICAN TOWN HALL MEETING IN GRAND RAPIDS, MICHIGAN) PALIN: Those things that I could do to invite business in and hang that shingle on the wall, if you will, that said \"We are open for business.\" And I'm ready to take that experience, that example, on to, now, a national level. GREENE: The evening marked a first for Palin since joining the ticket. She'd never publicly fielded questions from voters. One question at last night's town hall came from Kimberly King(ph). (SOUNDBITE OF REPUBLICAN TOWN HALL MEETING IN GRAND RAPIDS, MICHIGAN) KIMBERLY KING: Governor Palin, there has been quite a bit of discussion about your perceived lack of foreign policy experience. And I want to give you your chance. If you could please respond to that criticism and give us specific skills that you think you have to bring to the White House to rebut that or mitigate that concern. PALIN: Well, I think because I'm a Washington outsider that opponents are going to be looking for a whole lot of things that they can criticize and they can kind of try to beat the candidate here who chose me as his partner to kind of tear down the ticket. But as for foreign policy, you know, I think that I am prepared. And I know that on January 20, if we are so blessed as to be sworn into office as your president and vice president, certainly we'll be ready. I'll be ready. I have that confidence. I have that readiness. And if you want specifics with specific policy or countries, go ahead and you can ask me, you can even play stump the candidate if you want to. But we are ready to serve. GREENE: I caught up with Kimberly King after the event. She said she wanted to give Palin a chance to blunt some of the criticisms swirling around her. Kimberly said she wasn't playing a game of foreign policy gotcha. KING: I think that she knows and the campaign knows that she is lacking in that area. And you know what? So be it. But let's be upfront about it. GREENE: Kimberly calls herself an independent voter, and says she hasn't made up her mind for this fall. Since Palin joined the ticket, Kimberly said she has sensed an effort by team McCain to cast Obama as elitist. KING: I don't know that I think that's a fair assessment of him, but I do think that they are trying to build a case that he's even less connecting with the people, and hence, we're your guy. GREENE: Or gal, as it were. I asked Kimberly if McCain had found a good messenger in Palin. KING: The definition of genuine is to be who you are no matter what circle you're in, and I do think that she is that person. GREENE: I'm David Greene, NPR News, traveling with the McCain campaign.

Obama said the plan continues to give Iraq's leaders a \"blank check\" instead of pressing them to take responsibility. \"What has been clear throughout this process is that until we have a political reconciliation and stabilization, that we are going to continue to have problems in Iraq,\" he said. \"And the fact that this deployment \u2014 redeployment \u2014 is small and isn't taking place for five months, the bulk of it, I think indicates the degree to which the central problem still has not been solved.\" Obama spent the rest of his day in rural southwest Virginia, courting mostly white working-class voters in a congressional district that has an interesting presidential voting record \u2014 voting twice for Bill Clinton and then twice for George W. Bush. Trying to bring these voters back into the Democratic fold, Obama left the stage and hit the streets of historic Abingdon to shake hands and hobnob in an old-fashioned soda shop. Later, in a steamy high school gymnasium in Lebanon, Va., Obama reaffirmed his belief in the Second Amendment right to own guns.",

Now that the national conventions are over and John McCain and Barack Obama have chosen their running mates, it's time to take a fresh look at the battleground states. But what are those states? For a while it looked as if this would be a year when Obama, riding a Democratic wave, could compete in a host of previously reliably Republican states: Virginia, North Carolina, Georgia, Montana, even Alaska were on his list, in addition to the old standbys of Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Florida. But as the dust settles from the conventions, the map appears to be shifting back to a more traditional configuration. Here's a look at which states are in play at this moment in the race. For the purposes of this post, we define battleground state as one where current statewide polling shows the race to be within the margin of error, which is usually 5 points or less. Northeast The Northeast is traditionally Democratic territory, and with the exception of New Hampshire and Pennsylvania, that is still the case. In statewide polling, Obama and McCain are tied in New Hampshire. And it's a real battleground this year for two reasons. The state itself has been turning blue: John Kerry won it in 2004, and in 2006 Democrats knocked off both Republican House members, re-elected a governor by a record margin and took control of the state Legislature for the first time in more than a century. This year, Republican Sen. John Sununu is fighting for his political life. But John McCain has deep roots in the state, having won the Republican presidential primary there in both 2000 and 2008. Pennsylvania is a state that Obama can't afford to lose \u2014 and he does have a small lead there. But he lost the state's April primary to Hillary Clinton by nearly 10 points. The McCain camp feels its \"Wal-Mart mom\" VP candidate, Sarah Palin, has made its ticket more competitive with the white working-class voters in places like Scranton that have been so hard for Obama to win over. South North Carolina and Georgia are about to fall off the battleground list now that the Republican base has solidified. But Florida, the uber-battleground from 2000, is still very competitive. McCain has a small lead there, and Republicans are very confident of holding it. But Obama is spending lots of money in the state (he did not compete there in the primaries). And this week, Hillary Clinton campaigned in Florida on his behalf. Virginia is brand new to the battleground list this year, and the candidates are tied there. The state should be tailor-made for McCain \u2014 it hasn't voted for a Democrat in a presidential race since 1964. But the state seems to be in the process of turning blue. It replaced a Republican senator with a Democrat two years ago and seems primed to do it again this year. Democrats have also won back-to-back gubernatorial races. Obama has hired a lot of the same people who won the state for Mark Warner (the former governor who is expected to win a Senate race in November) and Tim Kaine (the current governor), and he has built a huge ground organization there. Midwest Ohio is always a battleground state, and this year is no exception. McCain can't win without it \u2014 no Republican ever elected president has. Current polling shows the Ohio race to be a tie. The bad economy and Democratic gains in 2006 make Democrats cautiously optimistic about the state. But Palin has helped McCain energize the Republican base that pulled Ohio through in a squeaker for George W. Bush in 2004. Palin and McCain are focusing on Michigan as a possible state they could pick up from Democrats. It's one the GOP hasn't carried since 1988. But Obama has a small lead there. The resignation of Detroit's embattled African-American mayor has removed a distraction for the Obama campaign. West The Rocky Mountain West is a huge battleground this year. The Democrats decided to hold their convention in Colorado for a reason: The race there is tied, with both candidates spending lots of time and money. Bush won the state in 2000 and 2004, but Democrats believe Colorado is slowly becoming more hospitable for Obama. He's also got a small lead in New Mexico, while McCain has a tiny lead in Nevada. All three states will see a lot of both candidates by Nov. 4. Democrats had hoped to compete in Alaska, given that Republican Sen. Ted Stevens is under indictment and Republican Congressman Don Young is under FBI investigation. But Sarah Palin puts the state back where it has traditionally been \u2014 in the GOP column. On the other hand, while Washington and Oregon were once considered swing states, at this time, Obama's lead in both is outside the margin of error. As of Sept. 9, Obama still has a lead in the electoral map. But it's a lot smaller than it was two months ago. Still, whatever effect the addition of Palin has made to the equation may change several times between now and Oct. 2, when she and Joe Biden hold their VP debate in St. Louis.",

            "article_content": "John McCain is running neck and neck with Barack Obama in polls and has a 10-point lead in one poll. But Obama is still strongly pursuing Ohio, Colorado, Iowa, New Mexico and Virginia; McCain is looking at New Hampshire, Michigan and Pennsylvania.  MELISSA BLOCK, host: This is All Things Considered from NPR news. I'm Melissa Block. ROBERT SIEGEL, host: And I'm Robert Siegel. Now, the state of the presidential race. Judging from the polls, the race between John McCain and Barack Obama is extremely tight, although a USA Today-Gallup poll has McCain up by 10 points among likely voters. That's a huge jump for the Republican nominee. Here to talk about the polls, the electoral map, the running mates and the convention bounce is NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson. Hi Mara. MARA LIASSON: Hi, Robert. SIEGEL: Let's start with the polls. Before St. Paul, before Denver most polls gave Barack Obama a slight edge, often within the margin of error, but an edge. John McCain now seems to have gotten a big bounce out of his convention. What accounts - is it all Sarah Palin that accounts for it? LIASSON: I think Sarah Palin is a big part of it. She definitely energized his base. And polls now show that the enthusiasm gap is closing. It had been strongly leaning to Democrats. Now Republicans are coming up to meet it. We don't know yet if this a true McCain surge or a Palin-fuelled convention bounce. And Obama got a bounce, too, out of his convention, and it faded. So we have to wait for that. But since 1960, we should point out that post convention bounces are - only been predictive of the outcome about a half the time. SIEGEL: About half the time. OK. LIASSON: Yeah, so\u2026 SIEGEL: There are two candidates... LIASSON: Yeah, yeah. SIEGEL: ...major candidates, running. By the way, enthusiasm gap - you mean until this time more of the people who supported Obama were more enthusiastic about doing so. LIASSON: Yes, by big margins. Yes. SIEGEL: If Sarah Palin helped energize and make Republican voters more enthusiastic, will that help John McCain win over independent voters - and disaffected Democratic voters, for that matter? LIASSON: That is the big question. I think with a certain group of downscale white voters - some of them were the Hillary Clinton voters in the primaries, Wal-Mart moms, for instance - she should do well, and the Republicans have very high hopes for her. But among pro-choice, more upscale Hillary Clinton women, for instance, probably not. So far, the polling around Palin is very partisan. No surprise. Democrats don't like her very much, and Republicans do. I think the big question for McCain is whether she can help him with independents or whether he can find a way to do better with them, because there are not enough Republicans this time around to have a base strategy election. He needs independents because, of course, Democrats lead in party ID by about 10 points this year. ..TEXT: So can McCain start moving to the center now with just 50-odd days left? And also the question is there for Obama. Can he make up for his deficits with small-town, white, rural voters by expanding the electorate, or does he have to do something different with his message? SIEGEL: Now, one of the axioms of reporting about presidential elections is that after everyone spends a month or so obsessing over the running mates, it is always pointed out that people vote for the top of the ticket, not for the running mate, and that, indeed, if vice presidents elected presidents then Lloyd Bentsen would have dragged Michael Dukakis into the White House in 1988. It doesn't happen that way. LIASSON: It usually doesn't happen that way, although Palin did something for McCain that was absolutely necessary. You can't go into battle for those crucial independent voters without having your base locked down. So she at least did that for him. But I think that in the end, we probably will find the same thing about Palin and Joe Biden. The differences, though, that the way vice presidents are used, usually they're sent to secondary markets. The ticket campaigns together for like one or two days, and then they separate. That's not happening here. She not only fired up the Republican base, she seems to have fired up John McCain. They have stuck together... SIEGEL: She draws crowds. LIASSON: She draws crowds. And so they've been campaigning together, which shows some of the strength that she brings to the ticket. SIEGEL: And on the other side, Joe Biden as the running mate for Barack Obama. LIASSON: Joe Biden, I think, is being used in a much more traditional way -  trying to reach out to those white, blue-collar voters where he has some roots. SIEGEL: Let's talk about the electoral map. We don't have a single national election. We have 51 separate elections in the states and in the District of Columbia. How is the map of where the candidates are going to contest this the most, how is it altered by the post-convention situation? LIASSON: Well first of all, the map had been favoring Obama. He had a number of previously red states to compete in. Some of them, of course, have dropped off the list, like Alaska. But there are states that Republicans can't win without, that Obama is looking to win. And polls show he's very competitive. Ohio, Republicans have to win Ohio. If he can't get Ohio, he could still make up the gap by winning other states where Kerry fell short - some combination of Colorado, Iowa, New Mexico, Virginia. On McCain's part, he's looking at New Hampshire, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. I think of the big three battleground states - Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Ohio - both candidates need to win two. And I think that white, working-class voters in all those states, all three states, are waiting to hear a stronger economic message from both candidates. SIEGEL: Finally and briefly, 57 days to go, the big events will be presumably the debates. LIASSON: I think the debates are hugely important this year. Forty million people watched both Obama and McCain on television. McCain broke records, actually, for a convention speech. And I think the audience for the debates will also break records.

AUDIE CORNISH: And I'm Audie Cornish with the Obama campaign. Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama spent nearly all of his time on the trail this week trying to make headway with the white, working-class voters he failed to reach during the primaries. He toured factories like this glass manufacturer just outside of Scranton, Pennsylvania. Unidentified Man: That's true. And some glass pipes... CORNISH: And in his speech to workers here, Obama pointed to the record unemployment rate and claimed John McCain and the Republicans had nothing to offer on the economy. Senator BARACK OBAMA (Democrat, Illinois; 2008 Democratic Presidential Nominee): John McCain, the other day, said that he thought that the economy was fundamentally sound, the fundamentals of the economy were sound. Now, what's more fundamental than having a job? CORNISH: But when Obama took questions from the audience, the economy took a back seat, especially when voter Joan O'Neal(ph) voiced doubts about another issue. Ms. JOAN O'NEAL (Glass Manufacturer Factory Worker, Pennsylvania): But there's one thing that seems to really be bothering people. Senator OBAMA: Right. Ms. O'NEAL: There's rumors going around. Senator OBAMA: Oh no. There's so many rumors. Let's see which one you're talking about. Ms. O'NEAL: This one I know. That you're going to take away the guns. Because people love hunting. CORNISH: Obama said the Second Amendment is a right he would not undermine. But it later prompted the senator to play defense against other unspoken doubts. Senator OBAMA: The temptation is to say, you know what? I don't - the guy hasn't been there that long in Washington. You know, he's got a funny name. We're not sure about him. And that's what the Republicans, when they say this isn't about issues, it's about personalities, what they're really saying is, we're going to try to scare people about Barack. CORNISH: Obama ran through the list of innuendoes that he's Muslim, or connected to radicals, or unpatriotic. He told voters, ignore the attacks. Senator OBAMA: If you give me this opportunity, I promise you we are not going to solve everything overnight. But at least you're going to have somebody in the White House who's waking up every day thinking about you and your lives and your kids' lives and your grandkids' lives. And I think that's how change is going to start in America. CORNISH: With that, he wrapped-up Pennsylvania and prepared to take on the next round of voters in Indiana today. Audie Cornish, NPR News.

            "article_content": "Social conservatives have warmed to John McCain, thanks in large part to his vice-presidential pick, Gov. Sarah Palin. Delegates from the battleground state of Florida and moderate Republicans reflect on Palin and their place in the GOP.  MICHELE NORRIS, host: From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. Im Michele Norris. MELISSA BLOCK, host: And Im Melissa Block. In St. Paul, they speak of Sarah Palin preparing to make the speech of her life tonight. The Alaska governor will accept the vice-presidential nomination before a big national audience. Our co-host, Robert Siegel, is in St. Paul at the Republican convention. And, Robert, great expectations for the speech there tonight? ROBERT SIEGEL: I think so, yes. Sarah Palin has worked in television. She demonstrated in Dayton, when the announcement of Senator McCains pick was made public, that she seems comfortable on television. This is a very big event before a huge crowd, but its a very controlled event. No matter what she does, therere going to be thousands of people waving placards and applauding her every word. So Id say that moderate Republicans whom Ive been talking with are very interested in hearing what she has to say. And for her conservative admirers in the party, this is a guaranteed lovefest tonight. BLOCK: She has had a rough couple of days, Robert, the announcement that shes hired a lawyer for the Troopergate scandal, the announcement that her 17-year-old daughter Bristol is pregnant. Do you get any sense there in St. Paul that enthusiasm for her has been shaking at all? SIEGEL: No, I dont. In fact, theres been so much coverage of her daughter, of the Trooper investigation, but also you read about who belonged when to the Alaska Independence Party? What did she do when she was mayor of that small town to the town librarian? I mean, thereve been so many stories that - as two Florida delegates put it to me, they regard the press coverage of Sarah Palin as so unfair that it is a gift to the GOP. BLOCK: Hmm. SIEGEL: Nothing unites Republicans like feeling that the press is treating them BLOCK: Yeah. SIEGEL: unfairly. (Soundbite of laughter) SIEGEL: So, they say  and someone said to me, the same papers, you know, that wouldnt touch the John Edwards baby story for months were out there asking very inappropriate questions about pregnancies in the Palin family. So, right now, it seems to have drawn Republicans together on her behalf. BLOCK: You mentioned earlier, Robert, youve been talking to Robert - moderates as well. What are they saying about the McCain-Palin ticket? SIEGEL: Yes. Ive been talking - and actually, by incredible coincidence, I brought you recordings of what they said to me a while ago. (Soundbite of laughter) BLOCK: Yes, Im not surprised. SIEGEL: Ill play excerpts of them. Theyre making the most of what they like about the presidential candidate, John McCain, his willingness to break with party leaders, his greenness on occasion that is environmentalism. And theyre also stressing Sarah Palins executive experience rather than the socially conservative views of hers that have so endeared her to the socially conservative wing of the party. One of the people I spoke with was Christie Whitman, who used to be governor of New Jersey and then head of the EPA in the Bush administration. She is now involved with a new centrist Republican group called the Republican Leadership Council. She and former Missouri Republican senator John Danforth run that. The group is trying to win back state legislatures by running moderate Republican candidates. As she acknowledges, it is the social conservatives who were galvanized by the Palin nomination. This is what she said: Ms. CHRISTIE WHITMAN (Former Governor, New Jersey; Co-Founder, Republican Leadership Council): No, theres no question that she has energized a base, and thats what the campaign was looking for. But you have to remember thats against the fact that John McCain did not have their unequivocal support because he wasnt conservative enough for those that are truly litmus test. He is more of a free thinker on those issues. Yes, he has always been very strongly pro-life, but he believes in stem-cell research and things like that. So, hes broken with them, and thats really why theyve been so disaffected or unhappy up til now. SIEGEL: So, members of the Republican Leadership Council have to stress the very things that have made conservatives a little iffy about John McCain. Those are the things you take heart in? Ms. WHITMAN: Yeah. Thats what we look at. The Republican Leadership Council is focusing primarily on the state and local races. And what were looking for is candidates who say, you know, look, I understand and I have strong values, but Im not going to feel that youre evil because we dont agree on every position and adhere to the other basic Republican tenets. But thats about it. SIEGEL: Has it been a distraction that were learning so much about, perhaps more about Sarah Palins family than we might have wanted to know a couple of days ago? Ms. WHITMAN: I think we probably always would have learned all of this at one point or another, so at least its, you know, coming out now and people can judge it as how they feel about it. SIEGEL: Another argument to moderates on behalf of this very conservative GOP ticket runs this way: Think about pragmatic, centrist leadership. Carly Fiorina, the former Hewlett-Packard boss, has campaigned prominently alongside John McCain. And she says shes been doing a lot of talking to middle-class independents and Democrats. Ms. CARLY FIORINA (Former CEO, Hewlett-Packard): Many Democrats have conservative social values. Ive spent a lot of time in Pennsylvania and Ohio, and working-class families in Pennsylvania and Ohio appreciate conservative social values. But they also are very concerned that an Obama-Biden ticket would take their party way too far to the left. And what they see in John McCain is actually a centrist in terms of his governing philosophy. And they see a track record of someone who has consistently reached his hand across the aisle on issues like immigration reform, on issues like campaign finance reform, on issues like climate change, and cap and trade system. They see him as a centrist with a governing philosophy of bipartisanship. SIEGEL: At a Florida delegation breakfast this morning, state legislative leaders from Tallahassee addressed the delegates. State Senator Jeff Atwater of Broward and Palm Beach Counties is about to become the Republican leader in the upper chamber. And he was echoing the theme of last nights speeches to the convention - speeches putting service to country over party orthodoxy. State Senator JEFF ATWATER (Republican, Florida): When Sarah Palin saw   corruption in the government of Alaska, in our own party, she didnt vote present. She knew what was at stake in the integrity of governance by self-rule. She stood up, and she voted country first, and we should be proud of Sarah. (Soundbite of cheering) SIEGEL: Jeff Atwater is considered a moderate in the Florida party. And when he told me the case that he can make to moderates on McCains behalf, again - as with Christie Whitman - it sounded like everything that makes GOP conservatives mistrust McCain. State Senator ATWATER: The man was willing to take the scorn of his own party to go campaign finance reform, to think broader about the prospects of what immigration could and may look like in this country, to be thoughtful about -lets not just be forcing down our moment in time on judgeships, lets create the Gang of 14 and find a way to work through it. The man has been extraordinarily willing to look at, as I would say today, at country first. SIEGEL: The dean of GOP moderates is Pennsylvania Senator Arlen Specter, the pro-choice senior Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, which confirms federal judges and justices. He says Palins place on the ticket will help the Republicans appeal to some independent voters, but what about pro-choice, moderate voters? Senator ARLEN SPECTER (Republican, Pennsylvania; Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee): People will understand that Senator McCain felt he had to solidify the base. People understand the pragmatism of politics. SIEGEL: At a Q&A session with reporters today, Specter was pressed. Would Palin hurt the ticket in the suburban counties near Philadelphia where he typically runs very well? Sen. SPECTER: Its all the matter of balance out. And I think that Senator McCain has made a careful calculation. I know John McCain to be a careful, a careful man, and I think hes made a calculation. SIEGEL: I asked Senator Specter if Supreme Court justices will be an issue, and if hes satisfied with Senator McCains promise of more nominees like Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito. Sen. SPECTER: The Supreme Court justices will be an issue in the campaign. And I think that Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito have brought to the court the kind of professional qualifications which are traditional on the court. SIEGEL: And judicial philosophy? Sen. SPECTER: Well, were  theyre at an early stage in their careers on judicial philosophy, but they withstood the questioning of many diverse points of view. SIEGEL: Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania. Like many Republicans here, moderate and conservative, he says he is eager to hear what Governor Sarah Palin of Alaska has to say in her speech tonight, her speech accepting the Republican nomination for vice president.

But McCain hopes to steal Obama's thunder with an announcement of his vice presidential pick.  MELISSA BLOCK, Host: From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Melissa Block. ROBERT SIEGEL, Host: And I'm Robert Siegel. After three nights of political hoopla and speeches, tonight Barack Obama finally takes the stage to accept the Democratic presidential nomination. The stage is a new one. It's Invesco Field at Mile High. It's the football stadium where Denver's football team, the Broncos, play. And Senator Obama's speech comes on the 45th anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr.'s I Have a Dream speech. We'll hear more about that anniversary in a few minutes, and we'll hear what some of the people in Denver hope their candidate will say tonight. BLOCK: Also, there's soon to be news on the Republican front. John McCain is expected to appear tomorrow at a rally in Dayton, Ohio, with his pick for vice president. NPR's Mara Liasson joins us from Invesco Field in Denver to talk about both these events. And Mara, let's talk first about the Democrats. You're there at Invesco Field. What's expected tonight? Barack Obama wowed the crowd four years ago. MARA LIASSON: He did. And Obama's campaign manager, David Plouffe, said that Obama has four goals tonight. He wants to tell people where he comes from, who he's going to fight for, what his change means, and he wants to make a contrast with McCain. And Obama himself has said that tonight's speech is going to be a lot more workman-like and less lofty rhetoric than people are used to hearing from him. He clearly wants to say in very concrete terms how he's going to help middle class families who are struggling economically. The Obama campaign is also trying to do something to make this very grand venue more intimate. I'm on the floor or the field of the stadium right now, and I'm looking at the set they built. It's kind of a faux Greco-Roman colonnade. It looks like one of those restaurants in Las Vegas. I'm sure it looks great on TV. But they have been thinking about how to make it seem like he is with ordinary people instead of just a lone gladiator with a huge adoring crowd. BLOCK: And the expectation would be that coming out of the convention, Barack Obama should get a substantial lift in the polls. LIASSON: Well, he's already gotten one. The Gallup's tracking poll today shows that he is 48 to 42 above McCain. And don't forget, he came in to this convention in the Gallup tracking poll with McCain ahead by one, so he had gotten no bump from his announcement of Joe Biden as the vice president. Most national polls, he's still running neck-and-neck. But in the electoral map, it is now the closest it's been since early June. Obama still has about 260 electoral votes based on state polling. McCain has 221. That's pretty good shape for a Democrat. And I should say there is this silly game that goes on with expectations and polls. The McCain campaign put out a press release where they said we expect Obama to get a 15-point bounce out of Denver, and that of course is ridiculous. BLOCK: Well, John McCain is coming right up on Barack Obama's heels now with this vice presidential announcement. And there's some speculation it could come out before tomorrow and then steal some thunder. What are you hearing about that? LIASSON: Well, stealing thunder is the McCain's modus operandi this week. He's been very adept tactically at not seeding the spotlight to Obama. He's released ads during this convention, throwing back Hillary Clinton's words against Obama in the primary. Tonight he's going to air an ad right during Obama's speech where he speaks directly to the camera addressing Obama himself. And I think the vice presidential announcement tomorrow, and possibly a leak of it tonight, is more of the same. The two finalists seem to be Tim Pawlenty, governor of Minnesota, and Mitt Romney, of course McCain's rival in the primaries. And those are two very different directions. I mean, you've got McCain - you've got Romney, who of course has a lot of experience; might measure up well against Biden in a debate. On the other hand, he probably has a lot of houses. BLOCK: Yes. LIASSON: And maybe Pawlenty with working class roots, and he's talked about how important it is to appeal to Sam's Club Republicans, not just country Republicans, would be a better choice, I don't know. BLOCK: Mara, looking ahead briefly to St. Paul, what are you expecting next week from the Republicans? LIASSON: I am expecting what the Republicans always do. They come out with a message. They deliver it with a sledgehammer. It's relentless. It's efficient. It's disciplined. They get their message out on the first day and they hammer it home, day after day after day. That is what I expect them to do. They've done it in the past and they'll probably do it again. BLOCK: That's NPR's Mara Liasson at Invesco Field in Denver. Copyright \u00a9 2008 NPR.

            "article_content": "The Democratic National Convention gets underway Monday in Denver. Sen. Hillary Clinton is expected to formally release her delegates to Barack Obama. But will that move unite the party? Co-host Renee Montagne talks with NPR News Analyst Cokie Roberts about whether the party can come together.  STEVE INSKEEP, host: It's MORNING EDITION from NPR News. Good morning. I'm Steve Inskeep. RENEE MONTAGNE, host: And I'm Renee Montagne. When the Democratic National Convention begins today in Denver, Michelle Obama will be the primetime speaker. There will also be a tribute to Senator Ted Kennedy, who's fighting a brain tumor. The convention starts after Senator Barack Obama introduced his vice presidential pick over the weekend, Senator Joe Biden of Delaware. And joining us to talk about that from Denver is NPR news analyst Cokie Roberts. Good morning. COKIE ROBERTS: Good morning, Renee. It's early here. MONTAGNE: It's early, so I guess I won't ask you what the weather is like. You probably haven't walked around yet. But this convention... ROBERTS: Oh, I've been out, I've been out. It's quite nice. MONTAGNE: Well, this convention is a moment for Democrats to come together. That would be the idea. Where do things stand with Hillary Clinton's strongest supporters? ROBERTS: Well, of course, that is kind of the story of this convention, and according to a couple of national polls out in the last few days, an NBC/Wall Street Journal poll, an ABC/Washington Post poll, both still say that about a third of her voters are still having trouble landing behind Barack Obama. They say they're either undecided or voting for McCain. Now, the McCain campaign is doing its best to stir up those voters against Barack Obama. After he picked Joe Biden over the weekend, they released immediately an ad saying he didn't pick Hillary Clinton because she criticized him and it showed her critique. And there have been some Clinton voters who have been quoted saying that they're upset that she was not even really thought about as a vice presidential pick, that she wasn't even vetted. She's been trying to tamp that down. She says that she, Senator Clinton, will vote for Obama as a superdelegate, and that she will release her delegates to vote for him. There's some talk that there would not even be a roll call, that Obama would be nominated by acclimation. But last night the chairman of the convention, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, said there would be a roll call. And Hillary Clinton herself is making it very clear that when that time comes she will be a good soldier and she will set an example for her delegates to vote for Obama. MONTAGNE: Is all of this working? I mean, are we likely to see any rebellion in the convention on the part of her supporters? ROBERTS: You know, I really don't think so. This is a convention of committed Democrats who want to win. Now, the New York Times had a poll today of delegates and only five percent said they still don't support Obama. Forty-three percent said they'd vote for him in a roll call; about the same as the 42 percent who said they'd vote for her. Fifteen percent haven't decided yet. But the question here is not about these delegates; it's about voters as a whole. And a big part of what Obama has to do at this convention is convince Democrats to vote for him. I mean, right now Democrats have a ten-point lead in party identification over Republicans. He just has to make sure to get all those Democrats. MONTAGNE: Well, those Democrats who say they won't vote for him and will vote for McCain, what are we talking about? Women, lower-income Democrats that went with Hillary Clinton. Exactly who is that? ROBERTS: You know, well, that's a good question and the truth is everybody's focused on the women, but Barack Obama's doing very well among women. In fact, that's - his lead such as it is in the polls is because of his support from women. In the ABC poll, it was 55-37 among women Obama over McCain. And similarly with lower income whites, he is leading among those. Less than $50,000 in the household, split 49-40 to Obama. His big problem is white Catholics, and there McCain is winning in the ABC poll with a 50-39 percent advantage and that's very, very significant, Renee. Because as white Catholics go, so goes the election. They tend to vote for the winner. MONTAGNE: Enter Senator Joe Biden, vice presidential pick, white Catholic, also roots in a middle-class Pennsylvania family - might even call him working class. Will that help? ROBERTS: Well, that's always the hope and that's certainly - on Obama's part - and that's certainly one of the reasons he picked him aside from foreign policy experience. You know, it won't hurt, but vice presidential picks generally don't do it in terms of convincing voters. So we'll see. Joe Biden will certainly do his best. MONTAGNE: NPR's Cokie Roberts, thanks very much. And Cokie joined us from Denver where the Democratic National Convention opens today. Copyright \u00a9 2008 NPR.  All rights reserved.

When the Democratic National Convention begins Monday in Denver, the woman wielding the gavel will be House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. In January 2007, when the Democrats took over the House of Representatives after a dozen years in the minority, the outgoing Republican speaker presented the gavel to Pelosi, and she held it up over her head. Pelosi loves to show visitors the view from the tall windows of her office in the Capitol, which stretches down the Mall to the Washington Monument. And she plainly enjoys her power. On the opening night of the convention, she will have a lot of it as she faces thousands of Democrats in Denver's Pepsi Center and, beyond them, millions of people tuning in to find out what the Democrats are about at this convention. One big challenge facing Pelosi is that almost half the people in the arena are delegates who supported the ultimately unsuccessful presidential campaign of New York Sen. Hillary Clinton. There's no chance, Pelosi says, that this convention will swing out of control. The convention will belong to Obama. \"I am very pleased that we're going to have the roll call vote. I think that was very important to do. But I don't think that means those people are against Barack Obama,\" she says. \"There may be some who are still unhappy about the outcome \u2014 and that is understandable \u2014 but as I say, they are Democrats, and they understand that if we are going to take the country in a new direction, we cannot have four more years of George Bush. And that's what John McCain would be.\" And does she share in their disappointment that there is no woman on the ticket? \"I would love to see a woman president, a woman vice president, a woman on the ticket every single time,\" she says. \"But it's no use discussing it. We have a candidate.\" Nancy Pelosi \u2014 who grew up Nancy D'Alesandro in Baltimore's little Italy \u2014 learned politics from her dad, who was Baltimore's mayor.  Their neighbors, she says, were the same type of people whom vice presidential candidate Sen. Joe Biden grew up with in Scranton, Pa. Pelosi thinks that Biden is the right person to deliver the Democrats' message to people who've been dealt out of the game \u2014 whom she calls everyday people.  She says Obama needs that kind of help, because of the way he has been characterized throughout the campaign. \"The challenge, then, is for people to better understand who he is,\" she says.  \"If others will criticize him because he is lofty in his aspirations, we have to make sure that people know that those aspirations are not for himself, but for working families.\" Pelosi's first convention was a long time ago: She attended with her parents in 1952, carrying a toy donkey that she named Adlai after that year's nominee, Adlai Stevenson. Now, she has bigger things on her mind. She says that when the Democrats win larger majorities in the House and Senate, her first priority will be to end the war in Iraq \u2014 and then rebuild the economy.",

The 2008 Democratic National Convention gets under way in Denver Monday with a surprise guest at the party.  Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-MA) arrived in Denver Sunday night.  Kennedy, who has been battling a malignant brain tumor, is the subject of a Ken Burns-produced video tribute that will be shown at the Pepsi Center Monday night. It's not known whether Kennedy will address the convention, but his spokeswoman said Kennedy is \"truly humbled by the outpouring of support and wouldn't miss it for anything in the world.\" The four-day convention concludes Thursday when Illinois Senator Barack Obama formally accepts his party's nomination, the first time a major political party has chosen an African American as its presidential candidate.  But beneath the undeniably historical nature of the event are some nitty gritty political challenges for the 47-year-old candidate. Recent polls show the race between Obama and Republican John McCain to be extremely close, despite a number of factors that should favor the Democrats, including an unpopular war and an economy dragged down by high gas prices and a housing crisis. Many supporters of Democratic Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton remain unhappy that Obama won the nomination and have yet to transfer their allegiance. Not surprisingly, white working-class voters, whom Clinton did well with in the primary campaign, remain skeptical of Obama. So the Obama campaign realizes it must still make the sale to millions of Americans, and their effort begins today. Monday: One Nation Day One of the convention will be devoted to the theme of \"one nation.\" It might also be dubbed \"a family affair.\" The featured speaker will be Michelle Obama, the candidate's wife. Also speaking will be Michelle's brother, Craig Robinson, the former basketball coach at Brown University and new coach at Oregon State University; and Barack's half sister, Maya Soetoro-Ng. Their job is to tell the story of Obama's roots.  That he was raised by a single mother, was a disaffected teenager who none the less got into Harvard Law School and became editor of the prestigious Harvard Law Review, and turned down lucrative job offers to become a community organizer in Chicago. House Speaker and convention co-chair Nancy Pelosi will address the gathering, as will Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill, an early Obama supporter. Tuesday: Hillary's Turn Former Virginia governor and current U.S. Senate candidate Mark Warner will deliver the convention's keynote address on Day Two. Virginia hasn't been in the Democratic presidential column since 1964, but Obama hopes to change that trend this year, perhaps with a down-ticket boost from Warner, who holds a commanding lead in his race. But the highlight of the evening is likely to be the speech of Hillary Rodham Clinton, whom Obama edged out for the Democratic nomination and whose supporters are still smarting over her loss. The theme for Tuesday is the party's new direction for energy and economic policy. The question for the Obama campaign will be whether it can count on the energy of Clinton's supporters. Clinton herself is likely to call for party unity against John McCain, and it will be interesting to see the reaction from her backers. Wednesday: Biden's Debut Wednesday night's theme is listed as \"securing America's future,\" but a figure from the party's past, former President Bill Clinton \u2014 whose support of Obama has been tepid at times \u2014 will have his turn to speak. The evening's other speakers, including the 2004 nominee, Sen. John Kerry, will highlight \"a new, tough foreign policy approach that is neither Republican nor Democratic.\" That dovetails nicely with the major speech of the night, from Obama's newly minted running mate, Sen. Joseph Biden. Biden is chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and his expertise on foreign policy matters was presumably one of the reasons Obama chose him. (Biden recently traveled to Georgia at the request of that country's president, after the Russian invasion.) Biden is also well-known for his verbosity. It will be fun to watch whether his speech can be contained within the bounds of the TV networks' primetime coverage. Thursday: Obama's Big Night On its final night, the convention moves from the Pepsi Center over to Invesco Field, the outdoor home of the NFL's Denver Broncos. The theme will be \"change we can believe in,\" as Obama will deliver his acceptance speech before an audience expected to measure some 75,000 people.  It comes on the 45th anniversary of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s famous \"I Have A Dream\" speech, in which the civil rights leader spoke of his vision for a colorblind society. Obama is well aware of the historical parallel. In an interview with USA Today last week, Obama said his address will be an opportunity for \"taking pride in how much this country has transformed itself in my lifetime.\"  He called it \"a remarkable thing, perhaps unequaled in modern history. I don't think we have to shy away from the significance of that.\" Obama will deliver his address from the 50-yard line of the football field, surrounded by more than 300 first-time delegates, \"everyday Americans and BarackObama.com contest winners,\" according to the party's Web site. Preceding Obama will be former Vice President Al Gore, the party's nominee in 2000. The GOP's Denver Defense While the spotlight will be on Democrats during the coming week, Republicans will be hanging around Denver, too, with a well-coordinated campaign to counter Obama. Dubbed Not Ready '08, the GOP effort includes two prominent former competitors of McCain, Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney. They'll be giving TV interviews from a studio within walking distance from the Democrats' convention site, and attacking Obama's proposals on national security (Giuliani) and the economy (Romney). McCain himself will be appearing on The Tonight Show Monday. And on Friday, as Democrats depart Denver, McCain is widely expected to announce his running mate at a big rally in Dayton, Ohio.",

            "article_content": "Democratic candidate Barack Obama's choice of Sen. Joseph Biden shows he's pragmatic, says NPR's national political correspondent Mara Liasson. She discusses with Scott Simon some of the positives and negatives of Obama's vice presidential selection.  SCOTT SIMON, Host: NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson joins us now to talk about reflections on the new Obama-Biden ticket. Good morning, Mara. MARA LIASSON: Good morning, Scott. SIMON: What does this pick say, perhaps, about Senator Obama? LIASSON: Well, it tells us exactly what he wanted it to tell us. You know, candidates are a lot more transparent than you think. And in the last couple of days, he has said that his vice presidential pick would tell voters that he wanted someone who complemented him, not supplemented him, brought experience in an area, in this case, where he has very little, somebody who wasn't a yes man, who'll say what he thinks - we certainly know that about Joe Biden - and someone who would also help him govern. In other words, he was looking for a vice president more than a running mate. And I think that's what this tells us. It also tells us that he is a pragmatic person. He did not go for someone who would - who's out of the box, someone new, someone who epitomized change to reinforce his message. He feels he does that very well just on his own. He picked a very pragmatic choice. He didn't want to take a big risk. SIMON: I think we'll talk about - there's some people, obviously, who'd tell you that Senator Biden, for all of his wonderful assets, sometimes can't find the off switch when he's talking. But he can be a really gifted and sharp campaigner, can't he? LIASSON: There's no doubt that Biden brings a lot to the ticket. You know, this reminds me a lot of the Dick Cheney pick in 2000. At that time, Cheney was from a small, electorally insignificant state, Wyoming. So is Biden, Delaware. But he is a working-class Catholic. He has roots in Scranton, Pennsylvania, which is ground zero of those white working-class voters that Obama still hasn't been able to bring to his side. He has long experience as the chairman of the Judiciary and Foreign Relations Committee. And as you say, although he is known for his verbal missteps, he did impress Obama during his short run for president with his crispness in the debates. And he - one of the most important roles of the vice presidential candidate is to make the kind of attacks that a presidential candidate can't make, and here he is attacking one of the Republicans who was running. SIMON: Rudy Giuliani. There's only three things he mentions in a sentence: a noun and a verb and 9/11. I mean, there's nothing else. SIMON: On the other hand, he sometimes says things that he has to explain later. (SOUNDBITE OF INTERVIEW) SIMON: I mean, you've got the first, sort of, mainstream African-American... U: Yes. SIMON: Who is articulate, and bright, and clean, and a nice-looking guy. I mean, that's a storybook, man. SIMON: I - there's... LIASSON: Ouch. SIMON: Yeah, ouch. The clean stuff, and there was something about 7-11s and Indian accents, if you recall that. LIASSON: Oh, there's been a long list of them. And he had a problem with plagiarism in the 1988 race when he ran for president. In the past, he's had what late-night comics might call a truthiness problem. He misrepresented his college record. But clearly, all that is overwhelmed in Obama's eyes by the strengths that he brings to the ticket. SIMON: And how does the McCain campaign respond? LIASSON: Well, the McCain campaign has already responded, and they've responded in an ad. It's already on YouTube, and it opens with a clip from the Democratic primary debate showing Biden standing next to a relatively grim-faced-looking Obama. (SOUNDBITE OF MCCAIN CAMPAIGN AD) U: What does Barack Obama's running mate say about Barack Obama? U: You were asked, is he ready? You said, I think he can be ready, but right now I don't believe he is. The presidency is not something that lends itself to on-the-job training. SIMON: I think that I stand by the statement. LIASSON: Well, there you have it, and the ad goes on to quote Biden saying that John McCain is a personal friend, a great friend, and I would be honored to run with or against John McCain, because I think the country would be better off. So you're going to hear a lot more of Biden's past statements used against him. I think at least on Obama's readiness, he probably has a pretty quick comeback now. He'd say, well, I might not have thought he was ready then, but he certainly is now. SIMON: Yeah. Well, it has been several weeks later.

NPR's Ina Jaffe, who is traveling with the Obama campaign, talks with Scott Simon about the choice.  SCOTT SIMON, Host: This is Weekend Edition from NPR News. I'm Scott Simon. Check your text messages because you may have gotten the lead story of the day just as soon, if not sooner, than most reporters. Senator Barack Obama revealed his choice for running mate earlier this morning in text messages. Senator Joseph Biden of Delaware will join Mr. Obama on the Democratic ticket. NPR's Don Gonyea joins us from Springfield, Illinois, where there's going to be a rally in about three hours for the Democratic ticket. Don, thanks for being with us. DON GONYEA: Hi, glad to be here, Scott. SIMON: You're on the grounds of the Old State Capitol? GONYEA: Well, I'm in a long queue with hundreds of other reporters, Scott, waiting to get onto the grounds of the Old State Capitol. The event is still about three hours away. The senator - I should say the senators are not here yet, the presumptive nominees. So, what you have now is kind of, you know, all the hubbub that takes place before one of these carefully planned events. SIMON: We heard a beep. Is your battery dying? Not your personal battery, but the one on your cell phone. GONYEA: Well, I hope not. It should be good. But I can't tell you how many pagers and buzzers and beepers are within about five feet of me. So it could have been any one of them. SIMON: Where does the Obama campaign see Senator Biden as making them stronger? I think the phrase they are putting out today is \"completing Senator Obama.\" And where do you, as a reasoned analyst, see some holes left to fill? GONYEA: Well, in terms of where he makes them stronger, it is, you know, the question that lingers there about Senator Obama, and we see it in poll after poll. If he has a weakness, it's that people think he's such a newcomer. They don't know a lot about him. They're not sure that his time in the Illinois State House, just a few blocks from here, and less than one term in the United States Senate qualifies him to take on the really tough global challenges that are out there. Senator Biden, of course, six terms in the Senate, a foreign policy expert, very highly regarded in that area. He provides the balance. What we don't know is what holes there (unintelligible) are to fill. I mean, he does not bring, you know, real connections to a big swing state like Ohio or Michigan or Pennsylvania or Florida. So Senator Obama is going to have to, you know, speak to those states largely on his own. Of course, Senator Biden does have a lot of blue-collar appeal that might play well in those states. But that, I think, is still the big question mark. SIMON: Almost half the delegates meeting in Denver, whom you will meet later, were sent there pledged to Senator Hillary Clinton. What does this do to reconcile their affection for the ticket? GONYEA: That is another thing that we just don't know at this point. I mean, in the past few days, Senator Clinton has been out there campaigning for Senator Obama, doing events. And, you know, it's fair to say that the response she gets when she urges them to support the ticket and support Senator Obama is not always as strong as the Obama folks would like it to be and, I should add, as strong as they perhaps will need it to be, especially in swing states. Now, Senator Biden is the kind of guy who would have a lot of natural appeal with those voters. But, you know, it's still going to take time, as the Obama campaign says, and as Senator Clinton herself says, for a lot of these folks to come around. Some are still licking their wounds after her loss. SIMON: NPR's Don Gonyea at the grounds of the State Capitol - the Old State Capitol in Springfield, Illinois. You know, they invented the corndog there, Don. GONYEA: I'll try to have one, just for you. Copyright \u00a9 2008 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Joseph Biden (D-DE) speaks during a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on July 9. Biden has served several terms as chairman of the committee. Through four decades in the U.S. Senate, Joseph Biden, 65, has honed a reputation as a heavyweight on foreign policy and national security and a strong debater, if one sometimes prone to verbal gaffes. Biden was born in Scranton, Pa., to a working-class family \u2014 his father was a car salesman \u2014 and was raised in the suburbs of Wilmington, Del. He attended Syracuse Law School. In 1972, at age 29, he became one of the youngest people elected to the Senate. A month later, he faced personal tragedy when his wife and daughter were killed in an automobile accident, leaving Biden a single father of two young sons. Biden remarried five years later. Biden is unarguably a Washington insider, yet he's never actually moved to the city, instead commuting home to Delaware by train every night. He is Roman Catholic, yet favors abortion rights. Biden has twice run for president himself, first in 1988, when he dropped out after being accused of plagiarizing British Labor Party leader Neil Kinnock. Soon after he suffered an aneurysm, but he fully recovered. Early in his 2007 bid for the presidency, Biden found himself apologizing to rival Barack Obama after a remark some found racially insensitive. He had called Obama \"the first mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy.\" During the primaries, Biden also claimed Obama was \"not yet ready\" to serve as president, a line that will no doubt be rehashed now by Republican rivals. Biden never went far with his candidacy, coming in fifth in Iowa. Biden's legislative career is long and varied. He helped write landmark legislation that set up shelters and a national hotline for abused women, and another law that put 100,000 police on the streets in the mid-1990s. He served as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee from 1987 to 1995, leading opposition to the controversial Supreme Court nominations of Robert Bork and Clarence Thomas. Biden has served several terms as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which he heads now, and has substantial contacts with world leaders. Just last weekend, he accepted an invitation from Georgian leader Mikhail Saakashvili to visit the former Soviet republic during its tense standoff with Russia. Biden originally voted for the Iraq war but has since come to be a fierce critic of President Bush's policies in Iraq. Biden complements a Democratic ticket in areas that polls show Obama is weak \u2014 he has gravitas, foreign policy experience, knowledge of the inner workings of Washington, and an appeal to working-class voters. While he has clearly harbored presidential ambitions, Biden would presumably be too old to run again if Obama were elected and served two terms. Where Obama is nuanced, Biden may also have a greater ability to talk tough against rivals in public debate. But the senator is also known to get carried away with the sound of his own voice, digressing into irrelevant personal anecdotes. Referring to this during the recent series of Democratic debates, moderator Brian Williams asked Biden if he had the \"discipline\" to be president, to which Biden delivered perhaps the best-received line of his candidacy: \"Yes.\" Biden is up for re-election to his Senate seat this year but could run for this spot while also campaigning on the Democratic ticket.",

            "article_content": "What do you think of Barack Obama's choice of running mate? Share your thoughts on NPR's 'Vox Politics' blog. Read a profile of Delaware Sen. Joseph Biden. Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama has chosen Sen. Joseph Biden \u2014 a man with working-class roots, but a long record of working in Washington's halls of power \u2014 as his vice presidential running mate. At their first campaign appearance together, in Springfield, Ill., Obama praised Biden as \"that rare mix \u2014 for decades he has brought change to Washington, but Washington hasn't changed him.\" Obama stressed the aspects of Biden's biography that make him a valuable balance to the ticket. He touched on the Delaware senator's blue-collar roots and his Roman Catholic faith. Obama also praised Biden's strength in foreign policy and defense matters and his history of working on issues in a bipartisan way. Elements of Biden's legislative career that Obama chose to highlight included his work on the 1994 crime bill and the Violence Against Women Act. \"Joe Biden is what so many others pretend to be \u2014 a statesman with sound judgment who doesn't have to hide behind bluster to keep America strong,\" Obama said. In his speech, Biden sought to link Republican rival John McCain squarely with the policies of the unpopular President Bush. Biden also displayed another asset he could bring to the Obama campaign, his wit as a political adversary. Biden spoke of discussing the nation's problems over his kitchen table, then drew attention to the flap over the number of homes McCain owns, saying McCain can't decide which of seven kitchen tables to sit at. The Obama campaign made its announcement on its Web site and in text messages early Saturday morning, after news reports said Biden had emerged as the likely choice. That came after three other contenders, Virginia Gov. Tim Kaine, Indiana Sen. Evan Bayh and New York Sen. Hillary Clinton, reportedly were told they had not been selected. Biden brings the Obama campaign name recognition that might have taken longer to develop for some of the candidates who have been on the vice presidential short list. One source of that name recognition, however, is that Biden has run for president twice himself, and both those bids offer ammunition for Obama's opponent. As Obama's rival in 2007, Biden also criticized the youthful senator from Illinois as \"not ready\" to be president and lacking in foreign policy judgment, comments the McCain camp pounced on for use in its first television ad after Biden's name was announced. Obama's choice of Biden as his running mate has drawn praise from fellow Democrats, including the one whose opinion may matter most, Hillary Clinton. Obama's rival for the Democratic nomination was mentioned for the second spot, but never appeared to be in the running for it. She hailed Biden as \"an exceptionally strong, experienced leader\" who will make a \"dynamic vice president.\" Republican response ranged from sour to gracious. House GOP leader John Boehner criticized Biden for his stand on energy issues, saying Biden has \"proven his opposition to an 'all of the above' energy reform strategy to lower fuel costs for families and small businesses.\" Sen. Dick Lugar, Biden's Republican colleague on the Foreign Relations Committee, congratulated Obama on his choice and praised Biden for his bipartisan approach to U.S. foreign policy. A key question remaining is how Obama's choice of Biden is likely to affect McCain's running-mate decision. Biden is known as a forceful and sometimes blunt campaigner who could mount effective attacks against the Republican team while Obama remains above the fray. McCain may go with someone who can also talk tough, such as GOP Sen. John Thune of South Dakota. Since Obama balanced his relative youth with the experience of the 65-year-old Biden, McCain may seek to balance his age with a young candidate, such as Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal. Jindal, 37, would bring the added advantage of being a governor in a field of senators. If Obama's choice of an older white man could be seen as an effort to reassure older white voters, Jindal's heritage as an Indian-American could bring diversity to the McCain ticket. McCain is thought to be looking at several other governors or ex-governors, among them Tim Pawlenty, the governor of Minnesota, who is a Catholic and social conservative. Mitt Romney and Tom Ridge could bring the McCain campaign business and gubernatorial experience. In a game that's already extremely close, Obama has now played his VP card, and it's a sure bet that McCain is taking a close look at his own hand.",

            "article_content": "Sen. Barack Obama is expected to announce his pick of a running mate. Among the front-runners being mentioned are Sens. Joe Biden (D-DE), Evan Bayh (D-IN), and dark-horse candidate Rep. Chet Edwards (D-TX). Obama will appear with his pick in Illinois Saturday.  ROBERT SIEGEL, host: From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Robert Siegel. MICHELE NORRIS, host: And I'm Michele Norris. No text message yet. Barack Obama is expected to appear tomorrow at the Illinois state capitol in Springfield with his pick for vice president, and he's expected to announce that pick in a text message alert to supporters, but who that pick is remains a tightly held secret, quite a feat in an age where leaks are so commonplace. Joining me now is NPR's national political correspondent, Mara Liasson. Hello, Mara. MARA LIASSON: Hello, Michele. NORRIS: Well, we know that we don't know who the pick is, but what do we know? LIASSON: We know, right. We know that he's decided who it is, because he said so himself. He's also left a trail of clues in interviews with news organizations. He told Time he wants someone who's not a yes-man and not a press hog, someone who compliments him. That's a clue, not necessarily augments his strength but compliments them. He told USA Today that he wants somebody who's independent, who can challenge him so he can have a robust debate in the White House, and that's pretty much what we know. NORRIS: There had been the expectation or perhaps even the hope among some in the Democratic Party that Senator Obama would announce his pick earlier in the week, spend the week campaigning with him or her. Now we're looking at only a couple of days before the convention actually begins. Help us understand the strategy here. LIASSON: Well, I think that the Obama camp feels that you can't get a whole lot of days of news coverage out of a vice-presidential pick. You've only got a couple, so why not do it right up against your convention so you start - you command the spotlight for instead of four days in Denver, for an extra two, and you kind of have this seamless flow right into the convention. The other thing that they did is they created a press frenzy about the vice-presidential pick, a lot of attention to this. I don't know how many conversations you and I have had about it on the air. And also, in that time period, they did a lot of organizing. By deciding to leak it - to announce it in a text message, you could go to the Web site, sign up. I don't know how many more new names they've gotten with that ploy, but everything the Obama campaign does is used as an organizing tool, and the frenzy and the curiosity around the vice-president pick was no exception. NORRIS: The campaign has been very careful not to let this name leak, and as we said, which is quite a feat in itself. How have they been able to pull this off? LIASSON: Well, I think they pulled it off by just having very few people in the room. Only about six people have been involved in these discussions. They are all top-level people in the Obama campaign, and they're very disciplined. That's what this campaign is known for. NORRIS: As for Senator McCain, we've heard that he's likely to announce his running mate next Friday. That's the day after the Democratic convention concludes. Are you hearing any more about that, Mara? LIASSON: Well, that certainly makes the most sense. It would be the Friday before his own convention. It would be the Friday, the day after that big INVESCO Field speech that Barack Obama is going to give. Certainly McCain has an incentive to step on whatever bounce Obama gets out of his convention. And it's interesting. John McCain has been floating some vice-presidential picks that have caused a lot of angst in his own party. He's been floating names of two pro-choice potential vice-presidential nominees, Joe Lieberman and Tom Ridge. I suspect that if he was left to his own druthers, he would pick one of them, but his staff has been kind of aghast at the notion that he would choose a pro-choice pick, and they have been dutifully floating these names to see what the reaction is, and the reaction has been pretty negative in the Republican Party. But it's interesting. Just as the introduction of a new foreign policy crisis in Georgia may have boosted the stock of Democratic vice-presidential possibilities, like Evan Bayh or Joe Biden, I think this latest flap about John McCain's houses has boosted maybe the stock of someone like a Tim Pawlenty, governor of Minnesota, with real working-class roots, who talks about the importance of having the Republican Party speak to Sam's Club Republicans, not just country club Republicans. NORRIS: That's NPR's national political correspondent Mara Liasson. Always good to talk to you, Mara. LIASSON: Thank you, Michele. Copyright \u00a9 2008 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "Barack Obama has been making news traveling around the Middle East in an effort to strengthen his foreign policy experience. John McCain is at home polishing his credentials on domestic economic issues.  STEVE INSKEEP, host: And let's go next to Barack Obama's home base - Chicago - which is where we found NPR's Juan Williams for some analysis, live. Juan, good morning. JUAN WILLIAMS: Good morning, Steve. INSKEEP: We just heard from Don Gonyea that this visit to Iraq didn't necessarily change Obama's position on the war. Do you think it is changing political perceptions of Obama at home? WILLIAMS: It's not clear yet. I think this thing is still in the offing, if you will. So far, so good. No stumbles. And I think a lot of people were looking to see if there was any gaffe that would embarrass him as he mounts the international stage. The key political question, Steve, is, you know, what American voters think, because polls have shown that foreign policy is a major point of doubt that voters have about Senator Obama. In polls, Senator John McCain is thought to know more about world affairs and more prepared to be commander-in-chief. In specific, if you want to break it down, blue-collar voters in swing states are really looking at Obama here. They want to see is, you know, is this a fact-finding trip, is he listening? Or, as the McCain campaign has been suggesting, is it a photo op with Obama using the war zone and American soldiers as props. And I think his own supporters want to know if this is really the first indication that he may change his position, his commitment, to ending the war. So lots of issues there. INSKEEP: Why would blue collar voters be the ones that would be particularly concerned about Obama's foreign policy credentials? WILLIAMS: Well, you know, I think they have the greatest doubts. He had the hardest time winning them in the primary process. And what you see when you look at the polls now is, again, this whole notion of experience is one that's creating the sense of risk or doubt about Senator Obama. And what's preventing him from, if you will, closing the sale with them, convincing them that, yes, they can trust him on domestic issues, but they can also trust him in terms of dealing with world affairs. INSKEEP: So when you say blue collar voters, is that another way of saying white working class voters, as it was often put during the primary campaign? WILLIAMS: You're so blunt, Steve. INSKEEP: I guess so. I guess so. I'm curious about something, Juan Williams. I wonder if these candidates, on Iraq at least, are almost seeing a convergence in their views and their policies. John McCain thinks the surge has worked, that the increase in U.S. troops over the last year or more has worked. Iraqis seem to think so too and seem to think that that means that U.S. troops can prepare to get out of Iraq, which is what Barack Obama wants. Did they end up on the same page at some point, even though they would never agree to that? WILLIAMS: Well, of course they would never acknowledge it. I think what you heard was Prime Minister Maliki over the weekend saying something like that. President Bush is now talking about horizons. Senator McCain saying with the surge working we can consider that, but we have to be sensitive to issues on the ground. So he would never - Senator McCain would never agree to any kind of deadline or timeline for withdrawal, but what he is talking about is, again, emphasizing the success of the surge and making the point that Senator Obama was opposed to the surge. So it's a back and forth there. But I think that the clear point - and here's the benefit for Senator Obama - he's driving much of this conversation. His emphasis on a timeline, it was not part of the conversation until he forced it to be. And now you have President Bush and Prime Minister Maliki talking in his terms. INSKEEP: One other question before we let you go, Juan Williams. I want to ask about John McCain and the economy. His campaign has been in a little bit of trouble in recent days, as you know. Has McCain stabilized his message there? Do his advisors feel that he's - do his advisors feel that he's in a good position as far as the economy goes and the election approaches? WILLIAMS: Well, no. I mean, they're still working on it. you know, he's - this week he's spending lots of time in swing states. And where is he going? He's going to grocery stores, hardware stores. He's going to talk about energy issues, health care. That's his way of trying to get a grip on that economic message that he's having trouble with. And there's also some thought that maybe this week he would appoint or name a vice presidential candidate to try to steal some thunder from Obama while Obama's on his trip. And the names that are out there include people who would offer some expertise on the economy. People like Mitt Romney or Rob Portman. INSKEEP: Juan, thanks very much. WILLIAMS: You're welcome, Steve. INSKEEP: Analysis this morning from NPR's Juan Williams. Copyright \u00a9 2008 NPR.  All rights reserved.

President Bush made serious inroads with this traditionally Democratic group. In the 2008 presidential election, presumptive Republican nominee John McCain and his Democratic opponent, Barack Obama, both are bidding for their support. The increasingly aggressive battle for Hispanic voters accelerated when President Bush first sought the White House in 2000. And it continued after his election, when, in February 2001, he traveled to Mexico and had a news conference at a ranch owned by President Vicente Fox. \"Mexico is the first foreign country I have visited as president, and I intended it to be that way,\" he said then. \"Our nations are bound together by ties of history, family, values.... \" Many Hispanics later complained that Latin America and issues such as immigration fell from the Bush administration priority list after the Sept. 11 attacks. But in 2004, President Bush won some 40 percent of the Latino vote \u2014 a major accomplishment for a Republican. Many in the party hoped it represented the beginning of a sea change. Issues Energizing Voters Mark Lopez of the Pew Hispanic Center, which tracks this demographic, says it is not a homogenous group. Hispanics from Mexico are distinct from those from Central America, who are different from Cuban-Americans in Florida. But Lopez adds that whatever their differences, this year there are 18 million eligible Latino voters \u2014 an increase of 2 million from four years ago. Lopez says two things seem to have energized these voters. One is the emergence of immigration reform as a major issue. \"If you look at the protest marches in 2006, you saw a lot of people holding up signs and a lot of groups pushing for 'Let's become citizens. Let's get registered. Let's express our votes. Today we march. Tomorrow we vote,' \" he says. And there was the long and hard-fought Democratic primary battle, which included well-organized and well-funded registration drives targeting Hispanics. Economy, War Among Top Worries Several things threaten the inroads that Republicans have made with Latino voters under President Bush. One is that polls show Hispanics list worries about the economy and the war among their top issues. \"Hispanics, like all Americans, are heavily against the war in Iraq. And, secondly, the economy is devastating Hispanics, who by and large are lower income, more middle class, more working class,\" says Federico Pena, who served in Bill Clinton's Cabinet and now heads Latino outreach for the Obama campaign. Ana Navarro, co-chairwoman of the Latino voter advisory committee for McCain, argues that Hispanics will be receptive to McCain's message on family values \u2014 and on trade \u2014 as well as the importance he places on relations with Latin America. She points to the senator's trip to Colombia and Mexico last week as an example of that. But Navarro acknowledges that the immigration debate has hurt the image of Republicans in many Latinos' eyes. \"Let's be frank here: The immigration debate at times has been offensive and hurtful to Hispanics and immigrants. But John McCain has never once in his life engaged in negative, offensive rhetoric against any group,\" she says. Reaching Out Navarro notes that for all of McCain's popularity with Latinos back home in Arizona, the campaign would be more than happy to match the 40 percent that President Bush captured in the last election. To that end, McCain has been running ads speaking to the patriotism of Latinos. \"My friends, I want you, the next time you're down in Washington, D.C., to go to the Vietnam War memorial and look at the names engraved in black granite. You'll find a whole lot of Hispanic names. When you go to Iraq or Afghanistan today, you're going to see a whole lot of people who are of Hispanic background,\" McCain says in one ad. Obama, meanwhile, has used a state-of-the-art, grass-roots organization to reach out. Outside groups have also joined in on the Internet. A video produced independently by Latino musicians and actors features an Obama jingle and a message to register to vote. Polls show that for all the problems Obama had with Latino voters during his battle with Hillary Clinton in the primaries, he is getting their support for November. Much of the focus will be in swing states, such as Florida, Nevada, Colorado and New Mexico. Each has a sizable Latino population. And any candidate who exceeds expectations among Hispanics there could be the one who wins the White House.",

            "article_content": "One of John McCain's top lieutenants is getting a battlefield promotion. Steve Schmidt is taking control of day-to-day operations at McCain's presidential election headquarters in Virginia. Campaign manager Rick Davis is keeping that title. But spokesman Brian Rogers says the 300 or so campaign staffers will report to Schmidt. \"Steve will have broad authority in terms of running the day-to-day operations of the campaign, including political and strategy and communications,\" Rogers says. He described the organizational shuffle as a \"natural growth\" of the campaign. But it comes amid criticism in some Republican circles that McCain has been slow out of the starting gate, especially since he locked up his party's nomination three months before his Democratic opponent. There have been rumors that former McCain strategist Mike Murphy might join the campaign. In an interview before Wednesday's shake-up, Murphy was noncommittal.  But he agreed that there is room for improvement. \"Campaigns are amplifiers. And they sometimes have to choose what they amplify,\" Murphy says. \"And I think the challenge to the McCain campaign ... is getting a simple message strategy that amplifies the best of McCain, which is that he is a different kind of Republican. \"And I think they do that to some extent, but I think it's a little murky. There are some mixed signals coming out of the messaging of the campaign. And I think the campaign could maybe use a little more of that focus going forward.\" The man who has been tapped to provide that focus is no stranger. Steve Schmidt's shaved head was a regular sight on McCain's campaign bus, until he was called back to headquarters a couple of weeks ago. Schmidt was also a spokesman for President Bush's re-election campaign four years ago, and he ran California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger's re-election bid in 2006. Matthew Dowd, who worked on both of those campaigns, says Schmidt brings both operational skills and good instincts to the job. \"One of the things that's great about Steve is that Steve is just a sort of regular guy from New Jersey, and he understands real people \u2014 and especially working-class, middle-class folks \u2014 and that has always helped him in the campaign not lose sight of who the voters are that they need to affect,\" Dowd says. Dowd also expects that Schmidt will add some much-needed discipline to McCain's political message. \"They've gone off track a number of times, and I think someone of Steve's ability is absolutely needed in having a plan and sticking to the plan and not letting the day's happenings change that plan,\" Dowd says. \"And John McCain understands that, which is why Steve's role has been elevated.\" Democrats were quick to seize on the promotion of Schmidt, who also worked for Vice President Dick Cheney. The Democratic National Committee called it more evidence that McCain would continue the policies of the Bush-Cheney administration. Campaign manager Davis has also been a lightning rod for his role as a Washington lobbyist. With Schmidt in charge of day-to-day operations, Davis will focus on longer-term issues, such as convention planning and the search for a running mate. That's roughly the same role he held before the last big shake-up a year ago, when McCain's campaign was nearly out of cash, and his political future was in jeopardy.",

On the campaign trail this week, Illinois Sen. Barack Obama and Arizona Sen. John McCain have focused on the economy, including their tax proposals. According to an independent analysis of their plans by the Tax Policy Center in Washington, both would cut taxes overall. The analysis concludes that McCain's tax cuts would primarily go to high-income Americans, while Obama's would favor low- and middle-income households. A big chunk of the tax-cutting done by both McCain and Obama would result from simply continuing President Bush's big tax cuts \u2014 which would otherwise expire at the end of 2010. McCain would extend them for everyone. Obama would extend them only for households making less than $250,000 a year. If you're among the richest Americans, the top one-tenth of 1 percent, the difference between McCain or Obama in the White House could be stark. Len Burman, director of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, says that under McCain, those rich taxpayers would, on average, get a $270,000 tax cut from McCain, but with Obama in the White House, they'd face a $700,000 increase in their tax bill. So if you're rich, you could see nearly a million-dollar swing in your tax bill, depending on who wins the election. Burman says a big share of McCain's tax cuts for the wealthy come from his proposal to cut corporate income taxes, which would benefit people who own stocks. Speaking to a small-business association in Washington this week, McCain portrayed that corporate tax cut as a job creator. McCain said he would reduce the U.S. corporate tax rate \"from the second-highest in the world to one on par with our trading partners.\" Doing so, he said, would keep \"businesses and jobs in this country.\" McCain also proposed faster depreciation for business equipment and said he wants to increase the standard deduction for dependents by two-thirds. Burman says McCain's tax cuts are clearly aimed at boosting the economy. He would lower marginal tax rates on personal income and cut corporate tax rates by a lot. \"Normally, you would expect those would encourage more economic activity,\" he says. But according to Burman, if those tax cuts produce larger federal deficits, the positive growth effects could disappear. McCain claims he will end the deficits by scrubbing the budget of earmarks and wasteful spending, but Burman says that realistically, the savings are not likely to come close to ending deficits. While McCain's tax plan focuses on growth, Obama's tax plan places its priority on reducing income inequality. \"The share of [U.S.] income going to the top 1 percent and top 0.1 percent of the population has grown to almost unprecedented levels in the past 20 years,\" Burman says. Meanwhile, the bottom 80 percent has had very modest income growth. Throughout the campaign, Obama has made clear he wants to close that income gap. Obama has called for ending \"the Bush tax cuts to the wealthy\" and proposed \"tax breaks [for] middle-class Americans and working Americans who need them.\" Among Obama's proposals is a tax credit of up to $1,000 for two-earner couples and $500 for individuals to offset their Social Security and Medicare payroll taxes. Obama would also expand the earned income tax credit to aid low-income workers. All households, except those in the top 5 percent of the income scale, would benefit from Obama's tax cuts. Households making under $20,000 a year would, on average, get a $570 break from Obama's plan. They'd get a $19 break under McCain's. In the end, the Tax Policy Center's Burman says, both Obama's and McCain's plans would add to the national debt. One important area left out of the center's analysis is health care. McCain's health care plan is based on big tax credits. Obama has not been clear about how his health care plan will be financed.",

New York Sen. Hillary Clinton ended her historic bid to become the first female president on June 7, 2008. At an event in Washington, D.C., that day, she told a throng of supporters that she was suspending her campaign, urging them to throw their support to former rival Barack Obama. The announcement marked the end of a long, and at times, bitter primary season that spanned more than 50 contests. Clinton announced her candidacy on Jan. 20, 2007, and throughout much of that year, as the race for the Democratic presidential nomination was beginning to take shape, she enjoyed a comfortable lead in the polls. It was not unfounded, given Clinton's eight years as first lady, her sizable war chest, her voluminous Rolodex and her historic candidacy as this country's first serious female presidential candidate. It was not to be. Ultimately, as the primaries and caucuses showed, Democratic voters decided against the idea of having a Clinton in the White House.  And although Sen. Clinton won impressive victories late in the season, including big wins in Ohio and Pennsylvania, it wasn't enough. By the end of February, Obama had accumulated an insurmountable lead in delegates, popular vote, and states won. The hard math did not stop Clinton, though, from waging what critics saw as a rough campaign. For weeks, her campaign focused on the controversy surrounding the inflammatory comments made by Obama's former pastor, the Rev. Jeremiah Wright. The issue of race became a central subtext of the campaign, culminating in May, when Clinton told a USA Today reporter how she was attracting the support of the important working-class, white voters. Exit polls from the primaries and caucuses showed a deep divide among Democratic voters, along the lines of race, class, gender and age, which Obama, as the presumptive nominee, will have to work to overcome. Clinton generally received the support of women, Hispanics, low-income/less-educated voters, senior citizens, and those who valued experience, while Obama earned the support of more affluent voters, African-Americans, young, first-time voters, and those who valued change. In the final weeks of Clinton's candidacy, particularly in blue-collar primary states, she portrayed herself as a populist: an everyday American who vacationed outside of Scranton, Pa., as a child and who learned the value of hard work. This populism, though, was in sharp contrast to other parts of her biography: her Ivy League education, her work as a corporate lawyer, and the fact that her belatedly released tax returns showed that she and her husband earned a total of more than $109 million since he left office after 2000. This personal wealth helped Hillary Clinton as her campaign began to falter financially. She had to loan her campaign roughly $6 million, in addition to the $5 million she lent it before Super Tuesday. From the outset, it was female voters who gave Clinton's campaign the boost it needed, including in the later states of Indiana and Pennsylvania, when many were already counting her out. In Pennsylvania, for instance, six out of 10 women supported Clinton, which helped her carry the state by nearly 10 points. The significant role of female voters also became apparent on the day before the New Hampshire primary. There, a woman asked Clinton how she managed to carry on after the attacks on her, and Clinton responded by tearing up, earning her the sympathy and overwhelming number of votes from New Hampshire women. It helped propel her to an upset win. Still, the first chink in Clinton's armor came several days earlier, in the Iowa caucuses, where Clinton finished third to Obama (John Edwards came in second), nine percentage points back. Then came the four-day period between Feb. 9 and Feb. 12, when Obama swept Louisiana, Nebraska, Washington state, the Virgin Islands, Maine, Maryland, Virginia and the District of Columbia \u2014 all by convincing margins. Obama extended that winning streak on Feb. 19 with victories in Wisconsin and Hawaii. There are few people \"neutral\" about Hillary Clinton. People love her or hate her. They love her sharp intelligence, her grasp of a breadth of issues and her past experience in the White House. Others, however, felt she may be too much of a lightning rod to win a general election.  Exit polls confirmed that a majority of voters found her lacking in honesty and trustworthiness. Earlier in the campaign, before the economy took the center stage, Clinton found herself on the defensive over her 2002 vote authorizing President Bush to go to war in Iraq. Clinton has since said that if she knew then what she knows now, she never would have voted for the war. She also refused to call for a timetable for the withdrawal of U.S. troops, which has angered and disappointed some on the left. But she has been a strong critic of the Bush policy on Iraq. By most accounts, Clinton has been a serious, hard-working and earnest lawmaker in her more than seven years in the Senate, more apt to do her homework than pose before the TV cameras. At the tail end of her husband's presidency, Clinton announced that she would move to New York to run for the Senate seat being vacated by retiring Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan. Republicans called her a carpetbagger, and she was. But she was also a far superior candidate than the GOP nominee, Rep. Rick Lazio, and she won handily. In her 2006 bid for a second term, Republicans failed to run a competitive race against her.",

Hakeem Jeffries, an African-American assemblyman in New York City, discusses this historic moment.  MADELEINE BRAND, host: Senator Obama has inspired millions of young voters and at least one young politician. His name is Hakeem Jeffries; he's on the line now from New York. He's a Democratic New York State assemblyman from Brooklyn. And Assemblyman, you and Senator Obama - you two share a lot of similarities. Tell us, what's your background? Assemblyman HAKEEM JEFFRIES (Brooklyn, New York City, New York): Well, I was raised in Brooklyn, New York. After graduating from college, went on to graduate school, law school, practiced law for several years and then in 2006, was elected to represent several neighborhoods in Brooklyn in the New York State Assembly. BRAND: But you share a similar political philosophy, correct? Assemblyman JEFFRIES: Well, absolutely. I think it was particularly inspiring to me when I had run for office. Initially I challenged an incumbent, came out of an insurgent movement much like Senator Obama did in Chicago. And some folks said, well, someone with a name like Hakeem Jeffries, you might have a problem getting elected in my little assembly district in Brooklyn, but it became clear to me that if a Barack Obama could be elected to the United State Senate, first out of Illinois, and then secure the nomination last night for a major political party, that certainly anything was possible. So it's inspiring for me, it was inspiring for my two young sons. I think it was inspiring for a lot of African-Americans across this country in terms of what's possible. BRAND: What did you say to your two young sons last night? Assemblyman JEFFRIES: Well, you know, it's been interesting because I think prior to the start of this campaign, Nickelodeon was the preferred channel in the house, but that's slowly giving way to CNN and MSNBC. And I wasn't at home yesterday because we're in session in Albany, but I talked to my oldest son and told him that today was the day, it appeared, that Senator Obama would become the nominee. And he's followed this campaign, he's known that he was competing against someone named Hillary Clinton, and that whoever won was going to then face John McCain to become the president. And I could tell that there was a gleam in his voice as a result of what I projected to my son would be this primary victory. BRAND: What about emotionally? How is it for you seeing this historic moment, an African-American man, achieve their party's nomination? Assemblyman JEFFRIES: I'm very optimistic about where we go as a country in the future, because folks under 45 have not been through the same racial wars as those in the older generations and I really believe see the country, see our communities through a lens that is increasingly color-blind. And that is perhaps one of the reasons why Senator Obama has done so well, particularly with younger Americans. BRAND: He does, though, still have that problem with older, white, working- class voters. Assemblyman JEFFRIES: I think he can increasingly connect with white,working-class voters on issues which are important to them. The Republicans often, I believe, have gotten folks to vote against their own economic interests by using wedge cultural issues, sometimes wedge racial issues, sometimes promoting foreign policy fears. But we have an important opportunity this year to change all of that, to move in a different direction. BRAND: Hakeem Jeffries represents Brooklyn in the New York State Assembly. Assemblyman, thank you for joining us. Assemblyman JEFFRIES: Thank you, always a pleasure. Copyright \u00a9 2008 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "A local election to fill a vacant seat in Parliament could spell more bad news for British Prime Minister Gordon Brown. The outcome is being closely watched for an indication of his declining popularity.  RENEE MONTAGNE, host: A local election in Britain today could give Prime Minister Gordon Brown more headaches. A member of Parliament in a northern district died recently. That opened up what's known in Britain as a by-election for the vacant parliamentary seat. And it's being called the most crucial by-election of the last decade because it's expected to measure just how unpopular the prime minister has become. NPR's Rob Gifford reports. ROB GIFFORD: The class war is over, declared Tony Blair in 1999, as well he might. Educated at the poshest private school in Scotland, Blair shifted the traditionally working class Labour Party firmly into the middle class. Now, though, with Blair's successor Gordon Brown in trouble, and the main opposition conservative party smelling blood, senior Labour Party figures like Frank Dobson have been up Crewe and Nantwich campaigning. Their main line of attack on the wealthy privately educated Conservative candidate and his leader David Cameron has been to issue posters of them wearing top hats and deriding them as out of touch with common people. Mr. DAVID CAMERON (Leader of the Conservative Party): We need to get our act together, and we need to better, but I'm confident that we will. And I think that when it boils down to it, British people would rather they had a careful, thoughtful man as the prime minister rather than a flippity-gibbet toff. GIFFORD: Flippity-gibbet toff, for those needing interpretation, is a light-weight posh person. Toffs are undergoing something of a resurgence these days in the Conservative Party. David Cameron went to Eaton and Oxford, so it seems did half his party's front bench and the new mayor of London, Boris Johnson. But Cameron has so far been relatively successful in neutralizing the toff factor by presenting himself as just a regular guy. Now it's the conservatives saying the class war is over. Mr. CAMERON: The Labour Party's approach to, you know, dress people up in top hats and play games of class war, they're hugely mistaken. I think the whole country's moved on from that. People actually want a party that's trying to bring the country together and wants everyone to have aspirations, not to talk about the past and divisions. GIFFORD: But all of this is masking a much bigger issue, that the Labour Party is very worried indeed that it could lose the seat of Crewe and Nantwich for the first time since World War II. Critics say for the ruling Labour Party to restart the class war is an act of desperation in a by-election that's being seen as something of a referendum on the leadership of Gordon Brown. With the housing market stalling, the global outlook bleak, and having made some major gaffs recently on economic issues, the Labour Party leader is coming under increasing attack. John Curtice, professor of politics at Strathclyde University, says defeat today would be a disaster for Gordon Brown. Professor JOHN CURTICE (Politics, Strathclyde University): He is already now getting opinion poll ratings where he's something like 14, 15 points behind the Conservatives. We had assertive local elections earlier this month in which Labour Party put in its worst performance for at least 40 years. If we now get the government losing a by-election, it would confirm the impression we already have, which is at the moment, at least, the government is potentially heading for defeat in the next general election, and the doubts that many people have as to whether or not Gordon Brown is capable of turning around his party's position are likely to be reinforced. GIFFORD: And that could even mean a challenge to Gordon Brown's leadership from within his own party. The problem for the Labour Party is that it's been in power 11 years already, and by the time the next election comes around, that'll be more like 13 years. Even if there is some kind of economic recovery, and even if the Labour Party candidate holds onto the seat in Crewe and Nantwich today, it make take more than trying to reignite the class war in Britain to keep the Labour Party in power.

Hillary Clinton is promising to stay in the Democratic race and keep fighting for the nomination. But so much has changed for her in the past year and a half, when she has gone from being the dominant front-runner to the likely runner-up. When Clinton launched her campaign in January 2007, the announcement said that she was in it to win it. For several months, it looked as though she would win. She had money, endorsements and a huge lead in the polls \u2014 everything she needed to convince most of the political world that her nomination was all but inevitable. Her campaign set out to prove that she could be a tough, credible commander in chief, a very high bar for a female candidate. Clinton cleared that bar by dominating the field in debate after debate.  She also made Illinois Sen. Barack Obama look weak and inexperienced in South Carolina, where he answered a question about a hypothetical Sept. 11-style attack and said he would respond by first checking in with the first responders. Clinton's answer, in contrast, communicated strength and experience. \"I think a president must move as swiftly as is prudent to retaliate,\" she said. \"If there were nations that supported or gave material aid to those who attacked us, I believe we should quickly respond.\" But Democratic strategist Mark Mellman, who is not affiliated with any candidate, said Clinton made a fundamental, strategic mistake. \"She clearly went with the wrong message at the beginning,\" he said. \"She ran under the banner of experience. We've known for two years that the Democratic primary voters would rather have a candidate of change than the candidate of experience by 2 to 1.\" \"She didn't have to do that, but she did. It was a serious mistake,\" he added. It's true that Clinton was not as new on the scene as Obama. But even former President Ronald Reagan, running for re-election at age 73, managed to run as the candidate of change. Clinton Out-Organized by Obama After a disappointing third-place finish in the Iowa caucuses, Clinton bounced back in New Hampshire. Then she could not do any more than tie Obama on Super Tuesday, when he focused his efforts on smaller, mostly red states that she ignored. \"The Clinton campaign acted as if they didn't know the rules, acted as if only large states counted,\" Mellman said. \"And the truth is they came out fairly even in delegates in large states and allowed themselves to get creamed in smaller states. And that's really where Obama built up his delegate lead.\" The Clinton camp made another false assumption by thinking that the race would be wrapped up by Feb. 5. Pollster Stan Greenberg, who worked for former President Bill Clinton's 1992 campaign, said everyone assumed the Democratic primary race would be finished much earlier. But when it continued, he said, the Clinton team was tough and experienced but not flexible enough. \"They were not willing to regroup and move to the second plan, Plan B, until after they were out of money and after they were deep in a hole on elected delegates,\" he said. Clinton Discovered Her Populist Voice Too Late Clinton's Plan B, which worked in later primaries such as Ohio and Pennsylvania, was full-throated populism. Clinton became a tenacious, gritty fighter for the crowds of blue-collar voters who became her base of support. Democratic strategist Bill Carrick, also unaffiliated with either candidate, said that approach might have saved her if there were more votes left to be won. \"I don't think it was until, really, it was almost too late to reverse the outcome that she found her own voice, which was as a tribune for hard-working people and blue-collar voters, which she's done quite effectively. But it was very late in the game,\" he said. The Michigan and Florida Factor There was another quirk of fate, Carrick said, that hurt Clinton: Michigan and Florida. The two huge states took themselves off the playing field by breaking the rules and holding their nominating contests in January instead of mid-February, as originally scheduled. \"Once again, the calendar is destiny in primary politics,\" Carrick said. \"The Michigan decision to try to go early was a disaster for her. The Florida decision was a disaster for her.  It would have been much better if they had stayed in the calendar, where they would have helped her.\" Obama as a Formidable Opponent Bob Kerrey, who ran for president in 1992 and lost the nomination to former President Clinton, says Clinton's tactical errors in her campaign pale in comparison with a much bigger, much simpler reason for her troubles \u2014 mainly, that her opponent is a great politician. \"I'm not sure Bill Clinton could have beaten Barack Obama,\" he said. \"Every mistake that she made, if she had not been running against Barack Obama, wouldn't even be a footnote. They're exaggerated. They're magnified because he kept out-raising her, because he was drawing enormous crowds, because he kept getting better.\" Now Obama is fewer than 70 delegates away from the nomination. Clinton is left making hopeful declarations like the one she made at her victory rally Tuesday night in Louisville, Ky.: \"I'm going to keep making our case until we have a nominee, whoever she may be.\" It's an extraordinary reversal of fortune for a candidate who seemed unbeatable less than six months ago.",

            "article_content": "Voters go to the polls for Democratic primaries Tuesday in two different parts of the country \u2014 Oregon and Kentucky. The fight between Sens. Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama continues, although Obama is working to sound ready for a fall campaign.  STEVE INSKEEP, host: It's MORNING EDITION from NPR News. I'm Steve Inskeep. Senator Barack Obama drew a massive crowd yesterday in Portland, Oregon. It's one of two states, along with Kentucky, where Obama competes against Hillary Clinton in a primary tomorrow. Oregon is also a state that Democrats expect to carry in November, which makes it a perfect place for Obama to spend his time right now. The Democrat does not want to act like he thinks the nomination is decided, yet he's also working to sound ready for a fall campaign. NPR's David Greene reports. DAVID GREENE: Barack Obama has seen some large crowds, but the 75,000 people gathered in the sunshine in Portland, Oregon yesterday seemed to catch him by surprise. Boaters and kayakers out in the river were pulling up as close as they could to get a listen. Senator BARACK OBAMA (Democrat, Illinois): This is the most spectacular setting for the most spectacular crowd that we have had in this entire campaign. This is unbelievable. GREENE: Obama praised Hillary Clinton. He said Clinton's been a formidable candidate and has worked as hard as she can; then it was on to the subject of John McCain. Sen. OBAMA: I don't think we've made great progress over the last seven and a half years, and that's why we can't afford four more years of George W. Bush's ideas in the White House. GREENE: Speaking of President Bush, he offered another signal that the general election's approaching. Last week Mr. Bush decided to go on the attack against Obama for suggesting a U.S. president should meet with leaders of countries like Iran. Mr. Bush said Obama's idea amounts to appeasement. His remark gave Obama the kind of opening he's been looking for to lump the president together with his party's presumptive nominee. This was Obama Saturday at another event in Oregon. Sen. OBAMA: If George Bush and John McCain have a problem with direct diplomacy led by the president of the United States, then they can explain why they have a problem with John F. Kennedy, 'cause that's what he did with Khrushchev, or Ronald Reagan, 'cause that's what he did with Gorbachev, or Richard Nixon, 'cause that's what they did with Mao. That's exactly the kind of diplomacy we need to keep us safe. GREENE: Obama's expected to win Oregon tomorrow while losing to Clinton in Kentucky. By night's end, Obama will likely have a majority of the delegates, allocated based on voting. Still, with plenty of superdelegates undecided, Obama told reporters he'll refrain from declaring victory, and that'll suit John McCain just fine. He had a message for Democrats that he delivered live from New York on Saturday night. (Soundbite of TV show, \"Saturday Night Live\") Senator JOHN MCCAIN (Republican, Arizona): You have two incredibly talented candidates. Why not take every possible second to weigh each of their pros and cons? For all you know, there're a bunch of cons you don't even know about yet. (Soundbite of laughter) Sen. MCCAIN: Cons that won't reveal themselves should you choose a candidate too early. GREENE: The joke, of course, is that McCain may benefit from a divided Democratic Party. One person who says he won't is Hillary Clinton. She was asked in an interview that aired on CNN yesterday if she's worried that if Obama's the nominee, her supporters might back McCain. Senator HILLARY CLINTON (Democrat, New York, Presidential Candidate): You know, in the heat of a primary campaign, people get - their passions are high, they feel intensely. That's all understandable. But once we have a nominee, we're going to have a unified Democratic Party. GREENE: But not so fast, is her message on the campaign trail, especially in Kentucky, where she's expecting rural working-class voters to put another state in her win column. Sen. CLINTON: If we get everybody turned out, it's going to send a great message to our country that you don't stop democracy in its tracks. You don't tell some states that they can't vote and other states that have already had the opportunity that they're somehow more important. I don't believe that. I want everybody to vote and everybody to help pick our next president. GREENE: Clinton noted Obama's absence in the Bluegrass State. Sen. CLINTON: I am proud to be campaigning in Kentucky. Now, my opponent said the other day he wasn't coming back, so I've got the whole state to myself. What a treat. GREENE: Clinton planned to stay in Kentucky through election night. Obama plans to watch election results in Iowa, a state that had its caucus back in January and gave Obama his first big win. Obama said he chose Iowa to, quote, \"kind of bring things full circle.\" David Greene, NPR News, Washington. INSKEEP: You can get a preview of the Oregon and Kentucky primaries at NPR.org/Elections.

Democrat Barack Obama didn't fare as well.\n                hide caption In head-to-head match-ups, the rural voters surveyed split evenly between Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican McCain. Democrat Barack Obama didn't fare as well. Pollsters included possible negative campaign themes for each party this fall. They included one question for John McCain and one for Barack Obama. No question was asked about Hillary Clinton.\n                hide caption  This week (May 13-15), 682 likely voters were surveyed by telephone in non-metropolitan counties in 13 \"battleground\" states (New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, Florida, Virginia, Colorado, New Mexico and Nevada). The polling was sponsored by the Center for Rural Strategies, a nonpartisan group trying to attract candidate and voter attention to rural issues. The Democratic polling firm of Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research conducted the survey, which was jointly devised and analyzed with William Greener of Greener and Hook, a Republican political consulting firm. The survey carries a margin of error of +/- 4.0 percent, at a 95 percent confidence level. Overwhelming support in the nation's least populated counties was key to Republican victories in the last two presidential elections.  But a new bipartisan survey indicates rural voters are not so reliably Republican in 2008. The poll indicates that Arizona Sen. John McCain, the presumptive Republican nominee, cannot count on rural voters to provide him a winning margin in the November presidential election. Double-digit margins in places beyond cities and suburbs are credited with giving President George W. Bush his margins of victory in 2000 and 2004. In head-to-head match-ups, the rural voters surveyed split evenly between Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican McCain. Each garnered 46 percent of the rural vote in the poll. That's a stunning reversal for Clinton, who rated as unpopular as \"illegal aliens\" in a similar rural survey done just last year.  Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, have worked hard since then to win over rural voters. But Democratic Sen. Barack Obama didn't fare as well, trailing McCain by nine points among the rural voters surveyed.  McCain is favored by 50 percent of those polled; Obama gets 41 percent. But a single-digit lead over Obama, who many consider to be the likely Democratic nominee, is not what Republicans expect or need from the voters in rural counties \u2014 which have been the reddest regions on the political map in the last decade. \"The message for Sen. McCain is, 'You're off to a strong start in rural America,'\" says William Greener, a Republican political consultant who helped devise the survey.  But McCain \"can't take the region for granted,\" Greener adds.  \"If [McCain] doesn't continue to build upon the advantage, it's hard to see how the math comes up that we win on Election Day.\" \"Rural voters have been base supporters in the last two election cycles for George Bush,\" notes Anna Greenberg, the Democratic pollster who conducted the survey.  \"And if John McCain can't win rural voters by the same kind of margin that George Bush did, it's hard for me to see how he wins the election.\" President Bush won rural counties by 16 percentage points in the 2000 election and 19 points in 2004. Those margins helped overcome Democratic dominance of urban areas and tighter contests in suburbs. \"This poll is more good news than bad news for Obama,\" says Alan Abramowitz, a political scientist at Emory University in Atlanta.  \"Because he's only losing rural voters by nine points. ... He's pretty well-positioned to do very well in these swing states.\" Abramowitz analyzed the survey at NPR's request, including questions about issues. The responses indicate that the economy is the issue that can give Democrats greater gains among rural voters. \"That's where the Republicans are most vulnerable,\" Abramowitz concludes.  \"If the Democrats can't capitalize on that, particularly among these white working-class voters, they may as well pack up their bags and go home.\" The survey asked whether Obama or McCain would do a better job with the economy. Forty-four percent of the respondents chose Obama; 36 percent chose McCain. The rural voters polled were also asked whether they agreed or disagreed with this statement: \"John McCain served his country honorably, but he does not seem to understand my economic problems.\" More than half agreed with that dismal assessment of McCain's economic sensitivity. The economy, the price of gas and the loss of American jobs to foreign countries are the big issues for Chris DeYoung, who participated in the survey and works for a radio bible ministry in Dorr, Mich.  He voted for President Bush twice, but he's leaning toward Barack Obama now. \"I think [McCain] has not been able to relate to what the American public is going through at this time,\" DeYoung says.  \"He has his head in the game more for foreign policy than Obama. But as far as the economy and jobs, I don't know that [McCain] has shown too much on that over the years.\" \"This is going to sound shallow,\" DeYoung admits.  \"But I'm also probably worried about [McCain's] age.\" The survey didn't ask about age, gender or race as issues, but it did ask about values, which is what many Republican and Democratic strategists consider key to the Republican victories in 2000 and 2004, especially among rural voters. When asked which candidate they saw as \"sharing your values,\" 44 percent chose McCain and just one-third chose Obama. This statement was also included in the poll:  \"Barack Obama says he wants to represent all of America, but he does not share my values.\"  More than half of the people surveyed said they agreed with that statement, including Shirley Jarvis, a registered nurse in Van Wert, Ohio, who would vote for Hillary Clinton if she appears on the November ballot. \"I have a sense of distrust of Obama,\" Jarvis says, citing the controversial statements of the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, Obama's former pastor. \"Barack Obama chose not to leave that church or not to speak up against [Wright] until it became a political issue.\" So, Jarvis is leaning toward Republican McCain.  \"I can at least trust [McCain's] convictions more than I can trust Obama.\" Republican political consultant William Greener says the survey responses indicate McCain can increase his rural margin. \"The challenge is to continue to build upon the matter of values, while at the same time, demonstrating the ability to address and solve the economic challenges that confront rural America.\" The survey's sponsor plans to measure the success of the rural appeals of the candidates with two more rural polls before the November election.",

Hillary Clinton won a landslide victory in West Virginia's Democratic primary Tuesday, defeating Illinois Sen. Barack Obama by a margin of more than 2 to 1. The state's demographics favored Clinton: West Virginia voters are older, less educated and overwhelmingly white, groups which have flocked to her in past voting. But the results will do little to change the course of the race for the Democratic nomination for president. In her victory speech, Clinton seemed to be addressing Democratic Party superdelegates and voters in the five upcoming contests, more than the cheering throng of supporters in front of her in Charleston, W. Va. \"I want to send a message to everyone still making up their mind,\" she said.  \"I am in this race because I believe I am the strongest candidate. ... I can win this nomination if you decide I should, and I can lead this party to victory in the general election, if you lead me to victory now.\" But Clinton also was conciliatory toward Obama. She said she admired the Illinois senator and that they shared \"a commitment to bring America new leadership.\" Obama all but conceded the state the day before the election. His dramatic loss to Clinton in West Virginia is likely to revive lingering doubts about his lack of appeal for white, working class voters and his electability in November. Clinton campaign chairman Terry McAuliffe told NPR that the New York senator would \"absolutely\" continue to campaign through the final primaries on June 3. \"We're winning this,\" McAuliffe said. \"We will be ahead in the popular vote by the end of it. We will be very close on delegates. ... And then the superdelegates will have to make up their minds.\" Delegate Math Favors Obama But increasingly, the superdelegates are moving into the Obama camp. He gained 30 in just the past week, negating any advantage Clinton might have had from the 16 or more pledged delegates she won in West Virginia. So while the drubbing in West Virginia may be embarrassing for Obama, he still leads Clinton by any tangible measurement: pledged delegates, superdelegates and the popular vote, and there just aren't enough contests left for her to catch up. And while Obama is setting new fundraising records, Clinton's campaign debt is estimated to be more than $20 million and rising. In a conference call Tuesday, Roy Romer, a superdelegate and former chair of the Democratic Party, announced his support for Obama, saying, \"This race, I believe, is over.\" It's up to Clinton, he said, to decide when to drop out. Obama Looks to General Election Obama is increasingly focusing on the general election and courting the white, blue-collar voters who have tended to favor Clinton. He visited the swing state of Missouri on Tuesday, holding a town hall meeting on the economy at a clothing factory in Cape Girardeau. There he went after the presumptive Republican nominee, Arizona Sen. John McCain, saying, \"A vote for John McCain is a vote for George Bush's third term.\" On Wednesday, Obama campaigns in Michigan. He'll stop by a Chrysler plant and hold another economic town hall. A rally in Republican-dominated Grand Rapids is planned for the evening. Over the next week, Obama also plans to visit politically neglected Florida and Michigan, which were stripped of their delegates to the Democratic National Convention after they broke party rules by moving their primaries up to January. Both will be important swing states in November. Clinton has no campaign appearances for Wednesday. Thursday she campaigns in South Dakota which, along with Montana, closes out the primary season with a vote on June 3. The Demographic Story West Virginia's voters are typical of those that have been drawn to Clinton from the beginning. The state is 96 percent white. Only Florida has a higher percentage of seniors. A mere 16 percent of West Virginians hold a college degree, the lowest percentage in the nation, and 25 percent lack a high school diploma. West Virginia also ranks near the bottom nationally in median household income. According to Associated Press exit polls, about 60 percent of voters picked the economy as the most important issue. Clinton voters were more likely than those who supported Obama to say the economy had significantly hurt their families. Seventy percent of Clinton voters supported her proposal for a summer gas tax holiday. Obama has called the idea a gimmick. Only about a fifth of voters picked the war in Iraq as their top issue. About half of West Virginia voters told pollsters that they believe Obama shares the views of his controversial former pastor, the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, either \"a lot\" or \"somewhat,\" though Obama has repudiated Wright's inflammatory statements. And about one fifth of Clinton's supporters said race was a factor in their vote, a higher percentage than in most of the states that have voted so far. About 60 percent of whites who said race didn't matter also voted for Clinton. The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

Barack Obama won a decisive victory in North Carolina's Democratic primary Tuesday, while rival Sen. Hillary Clinton held on to win a squeaker of a race in Indiana. The split result means that the epic struggle for the Democratic presidential nomination will likely continue through the last primaries on June 3. Clinton campaigned aggressively in the Hoosier State, trying to build on her victory in Pennsylvania last month. She had a large lead in early returns, but saw it shrink as the results came in from Indianapolis, Bloomington and Gary, which were Obama strongholds. She won by a margin of about 22,000 votes out of more than 1.2 million cast. In North Carolina, the largest prize remaining in the nomination fight, Obama had 56 percent of the vote to Clinton's 42 percent. The Illinois senator received more than 90 percent of the African-American vote and about 40 percent of white votes in the state, according to Associated Press exit polls. He also won among every age group except voters older than 65. Indiana exit polls showed that Clinton got the majority of votes from white men, as she did in Pennsylvania and Ohio. And she made gains with a couple of groups that have been part of Obama's core support, splitting the votes of younger white voters and voters with incomes of at least $100,000 a year. There were a total of 187 delegates at stake in Tuesday's primaries \u2014 115 in North Carolina and 72 in Indiana. Obama Calls for Unity Addressing his supporters in Raleigh, N.C., Obama predicted that Democrats will be unified in November, no matter whom the party nominates. \"Yes, there have been bruised feelings on both sides,\" Obama said. \"This fall, we intend to march forward as one Democratic Party, united by a common vision for this country. Because we all agree that at this defining moment in history \u2014 a moment when we're facing two wars, an economy in turmoil, a planet in peril \u2014 we can't afford to give John McCain the chance to serve out George Bush's third term.\" Indiana superdelegate Joe Andrew, who served as Democratic National Committee chairman during Bill Clinton's second term and who recently switched his allegiance from Clinton to Obama, called the address \"the first speech of the general election.\" Clinton Declares Victory in Indiana Even before the Indiana primary's outcome was decided, Clinton told supporters in Indianapolis that she intended to fight on. \"Tonight we've come from behind,\" she said. \"Thanks to you, it's full speed ahead on to the White House.\" She vowed to work her heart out in West Virginia and Kentucky, which hold primaries later this month. With her options for overtaking Obama in the delegate count dwindling, Clinton once again called on the Democratic Party to count the contests in Florida and Michigan, which were stripped of their delegates as punishment for moving their primaries up to January. Clinton won in both states, but neither candidate campaigned in them and Obama's name was not on the ballot in Michigan. Economy on Voters' Minds Two-thirds of Indiana voters and nearly as many in North Carolina said the sputtering economy was their top issue, according to exit polls. Clinton and Obama have sparred in recent weeks over what to do about the skyrocketing cost of gasoline. Clinton, like presumptive Republican nominee McCain, advocates eliminating the federal gas tax for the summer. Obama has called it a gimmick and said a tax cut would be the way to help the middle class deal with rising costs. Only about 20 percent of voters in both states said that the war in Iraq was their top issue and even fewer picked health care. The State of the Race Obama's victory in North Carolina \u2014 his first win in a large-state primary in nearly three months \u2014 came on the heels of several rough weeks for his campaign. His loss to Clinton in Pennsylvania by just over 9 points was followed by renewed controversy over inflammatory remarks by his former pastor, Jeremiah Wright. Exit polls indicated that voters in both North Carolina and Indiana were equally divided on whether the controversy mattered to them. Among white voters who said it did matter, roughly 80 percent went for Clinton. But by winning North Carolina and keeping Indiana close, Obama demonstrated that he's a survivor and still a strong contender. He eased the worries of some Democrats that he would use his pledged delegate lead to \"run out the clock,\" so to speak, and just limp across the finish line when the primaries ended in June. Clinton was hoping that Tuesday's primaries would be a \"game changer.\" Instead, the contests were seen as a lost opportunity to cut into Obama's apparently insurmountable lead in pledged delegates. More importantly, she'd hoped a strong showing would convince the unpledged superdelegates that she would be the best candidate to take on McCain in November because of her support among white, working-class voters. Clinton campaign strategist Geoff Garin says she still can make that argument. \"On the crucial issue of the economy and among the crucial swing voters, I think there's a very strong and persuasive case that she offers a lot more to the Democratic Party in terms of a victory in the fall and offers more to the country,\" Garin told NPR. McCain Campaigns in N.C., Too Perhaps wanting to be where the action is, McCain has been campaigning in North Carolina for the past couple of days. At Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem on Tuesday, the Arizona senator blasted Obama for being one of 22 senators to vote against the confirmation of John Roberts as chief justice of the Supreme Court and vowed that he would appoint conservatives to the bench. Obama spokesman Tommy Vietor responded that McCain was promising \"four more years of out-of-touch judges that would threaten a woman's right to choose, gut the campaign finance reform that bears his own name and trample the rights and interests of the American people.\" Clinton also voted against Roberts. Her campaign accused McCain of pandering to the right wing by \"elevating the interests of big business over the rights of workers and consumers, affirming executive branch power grabs, and undermining our common core freedoms.\" From NPR reports and The Associated Press.",

            "article_content": "Hillary Clinton and Bill O'Reilly hashed it out on The O'Reilly Factor Wednesday night. The conservative news host quizzed the Democratic presidential candidate about her plans for health care and taxes.  STEVE INSKEEP, host: Hillary Clinton gets talked about on the \"O'Reilly Factor,\" but it was rare that she appeared on it last night. She made an appearance on the most popular show on the Fox News Channel. Bill O'Reilly kicked off last night's interview in Indiana, which hosts this primary next week. (Soundbite of TV show, \"O'Reilly Factor\") Mr. BILL O'REILLY (Show host): And also, we're in the land of the fighting Irish. Senator HILLARY CLINTON (Democrat, New York; Democratic Presidential Candidate): Well, I'm a fighter. So, you know, we have something in common there. Mr. O'REILLY: And I'm Irish. So we've got the thing going on. INSKEEP: NPR media correspondent David Folkenflik was watching as they had the thing going on. David, good morning. DAVID FOLKENFLIK: Good morning. INSKEEP: Haven't Democratic presidential candidates been avoiding Fox News largely? FOLKENFLIK: Well, you think during the primary's that's not the place that's going to be most rich in Democratic voters. You know, last year, John Edwards, who had recanted his vote against authorizing the invasion of Iraq, you know, made a big deal of saying, look, we're not going to go to Fox. It's not a fair place. And Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama pulled out of a debate in Nevada that had been scheduled on Fox News after a lot of pressure from the anti-war group MoveOn.org. It was seen as not a place to go. But, you know, there're these primaries you're mentioning in Indiana, as well as North Carolina. It's a place where Independents and perhaps more conservative working-class ethnic white Democrats might be more likely to watch. Hillary Clinton's had some success in places like Pennsylvania, you know, in getting voters like that, and she's trying to court them. INSKEEP: So what did those voters see last night? FOLKENFLIK: Well, O'Reilly started off with a hot button issue of the radical views of the Reverend Jeremiah Wright, who's, after all, somebody who's been cited - until very recently - as this sort of spiritual advisor and mentor of Senator Obama. Aside from about a minute or two of that, though, he kind of let it drop. He played, I don't know, a sharp-tongued interrogator, the role that he presents himself as every night. But Clinton was at ease much of the time, as in say, for example, this exchange, I think we have, about her plans on health care. (Soundbite of TV show, \"O'Reilly Factor\") Mr. O'REILLY: You know, you're going to bankrupt the country with Hill Care, right? The health care program. Do you have any\u2026 Sen. CLINTON: Oh, no I'm not. No I'm not. Mr. O'REILLY: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. You're going to bankrupt the country. Sen. CLINTON: No, I'm not. That is so untrue. Mr. O'REILLY: Look, California\u2026 Sen. CLINTON: If we don't get to universal health care, we will continue to bleed money. FOLKENFLIK: So she hit her talking points without sounding like somebody who was hitting her talking points. She was completely at ease in, you know, what Democrats would think of as the lion's den. INSKEEP: And we should mention that Bill O'Reilly also asked this candidate who's seeking working-class votes about her own wealth. (Soundbite of TV show, \"O'Reilly Factor\") Mr. O'REILLY: You know, your husband and I make a lot of money. Did you know that? Sen. CLINTON: I've heard that. Mr. O'REILLY: Yeah. We make a lot of money. (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. O'REILLY: And you, if you're president, are going to take more of my money and your husband's money away, away. Okay. Now I'm paying 33 percent Fed tax now. You're going to raise that to what? Sen. CLINTON: You know what? Rich people - God bless us - we deserve all the opportunities to make sure\u2026 Mr. O'REILLY: All right. So I'm going to assume\u2026 Sen. CLINTON: \u2026our country and our blessings continue to the next generation. (Soundbite of laughter) INSKEEP: David Folkenflik, did they resolve that argument? FOLKENFLIK: Well, I don't know about that, but when is the last time you had a candidate not named Mitt Romney admit she was rich? You know, that's something that as you're trolling for working-class votes you don't try to dwell on that much. O'Reilly managed to extract that from her. INSKEEP: Can I ask what's in it for Fox News to have a Democratic candidate on like this? FOLKENFLIK: Well, there's been a little bit of anxiety about what Fox's role is in the post-George W. Bush world if Democrats, for example, take the White House. If people are on an anti-war swing, where do they go? You know, there's been a lot of viewer and voter interest in this political season, but Fox has been lifted perhaps less than its competitors on cable, which, after all, have more ground to make up. In this case, Fox gets to show it's relevant. It just had on Senator Obama for the first time in 700-something days. Here they're back in the swing of things. INSKEEP: David, thanks very much. FOLKENFLIK: You bet. INSKEEP: NPR media correspondent David Folkenflik. Copyright \u00a9 2008 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "Republican presumptive presidential nominee John McCain has been campaigning this week in poor communities often overlooked by the GOP. He may not win much support in the mostly Democratic neighborhoods, but the tour may attract moderate voters who are McCain's real target.  RENEE MONTAGNE, Host: NPR's Scott Horsley reports. SCOTT HORSLEY: The McCain campaign billed this week as its Time for Action tour. But from its very first day in Selma, Alabama, McCain made it clear he wasn't talking primarily about action by the federal government. HORSLEY: I'm not going to tell anybody about how government can make their choices for them, but how we can help grow our economy so that people have better choices to make for themselves. HORSLEY: He says that will help foster new jobs and new industries, where the U.S. is most competitive. HORSLEY: Today, for example, 1.3 million people in the world make a living off eBay. Most of those are in the United States of America. HORSLEY: Youngstown Mayor Jay Williams likes the idea of enhanced training. But Williams - a Democrat who's supporting Barack Obama - says McCain has an uphill battle, especially since his platform on taxes and health care is very similar to President Bush's. MONTAGNE: If it was just John McCain absent the last eight years, he might have a better opportunity. But I think he's going to be hard pressed to really distance himself from what's been going on over the past eight years. HORSLEY: Still, Williams gives McCain credit for showing up in Youngstown. Like many of the stops on McCain's tour this week, the city is heavily Democratic, and heavily African-American. MONTAGNE: Even if he didn't win a lot of people over, he did at least put himself in a position to say, well, I came and brought my message there. I wasn't going to run away from the fact that this was a, historically, been a Democratic area. HORSLEY: And that's the whole point, says political analyst Jack Pitney of Claremont McKenna College. P: John McCain really isn't expecting to get any more than a sliver of the black vote or do well among poor voters. What he's hoping to do is reach out to moderate white voters who want to see a presidential candidate showing compassion. So, his real audience consists not of the people in front of him, but of the people watching in the media. HORSLEY: On Wednesday, McCain drew an overflow crowd to the Martin County Courthouse in Kentucky. Republican State Senator Brandon Smith thinks his experience as a prisoner of war may have helped McCain, one of the nation's wealthiest senators, to connect with his poor Appalachian audience. HORSLEY: We were pretty much isolated here in these mountains, and I don't think, a lot of people felt we were left, you know, behind. And I think, obviously, being a POW, you're left behind. You know, you're there on your own. And if there's one thing he connects with people there is he knows what it feels like to be abandoned or to be left behind and to have to be on your own and have to have the inner strength to put it together to come out of that. HORSLEY: That may help to account for McCain's strong showing with white working-class men. In a recent Wall Street Journal/NBC poll, McCain did better with those men with either Obama or Hillary Clinton did, but political analyst Pitney warns the sagging economy could erode that support. MONTAGNE: His appeal to white working-class voters is partly cultural and partly a matter of his status as a war hero. But if the economy is still in recession on Election Day, then he's going to have a very, very hard time, no matter how many tours he makes. HORSLEY: Scott Horsley, NPR News.

            "article_content": "John McCain has asked the North Carolina GOP not to run a television ad that brings up Barack Obama's controversial former pastor. North Carolina Republican Party officials insist the ad will run as planned, starting Monday.  RENEE MONTAGNE, host: Along with Indiana, North Carolina is next up in the presidential primary stakes, so it shouldn't come as a surprise that a new attack ad is about to air. It portrays Barack Obama as, quote, \"too extreme for North Carolina\" and features Obama's controversial former minister Jeremiah Wright. This ad isn't produced by the Hillary Clinton campaign, it's the product of the North Carolina Republican Party. And one critic of the ad is the Republican's own presumptive nominee, John McCain. Joining us now for some analysis on this is NPR's Juan Williams. Good morning. JUAN WILLIAMS: Good morning, Renee. MONTAGNE: What is it in this ad that offends Senator McCain. WILLIAMS: Well, you know, there's a video of Reverend Wright, in full fury, damning America. And, as you said, saying that he's too extreme for North Carolina - about Senator Barack Obama. There's also a photo of Barack Obama with Wright - the implication being that Senator Obama heard just this kind of language coming from Reverend Wright. The Republican National Committee chairman, Mike Duncan, has also joined John McCain in condemning the ad, asking that it not run - although the state party and their chair, Linda Davies, say that they are going to run it. They say that this is a matter of patriotism and judgment. But, you know, when you hear Senator McCain and the Republican National Committee chair trying to pull it, I think it suggests that they sense that this could backfire on the party and on Senator McCain if it becomes perceived as an overtly racial attack on the potential Democratic nominee, Senator Obama. MONTAGNE: But wouldn't John McCain, in a sense, get it both ways here? He takes the high ground, condemns the ad, but also gets some benefit from it. WILLIAMS: Well, that's exactly right, you know, you can't read his mind but clearly what's going on here, is that he's preparing himself - positioning himself for a general election against Senator Obama and protecting against the possibility that people would say that he's playing on racial antagonism. Senator McCain this week was in Selma, Alabama at the Edmund Pettis Bridge. He's also touring the Lower Ninth Ward, this week, in New Orleans - that suffered such damage in Hurricane Katrina. He's visited the King Museum in Memphis. He wants to be able to say he has clean hands in the fall, especially given Senator Obama's problem with working class white voters. Just look at what happened this week in Pennsylvania, Rene, where  Senator Clinton won 65 percent of white women, 55 percent of white men. I think that you could see where this thing could become very racial, very quickly. MONTAGNE: Juan, is there a shift among Republicans in terms of which Democratic candidate would be easier to beat. WILLIAMS: Over the last few days, Renee, it looks as if Republicans now have come to the conclusion that Senator Obama would be easier to beat. As you know, for a long time, the thought was that Senator Clinton - given that she can be polarizing and she had lots of baggage relating back to her husband, Bill Clinton, was really the ideal candidate for Republicans to line up and defeat. But now the sense is that Senator Obama has some real liabilities. Earlier this month, there was an AP poll that showed that eight percent of white Americans said that they would be uncomfortable voting for a black person to be president. So, you have to also factor in all that happened in Pennsylvania with White working class voters and it looks like what you're going to see here is a real struggle for the Democrats to stand behind Senator Obama, if he's the nominee, and try to make sure that working class white voters - the so-called Reagan Democrats - are not lost to Senator McCain.

Hillary Clinton greets a crowd at a campaign event Wednesday in Indianapolis. Despite New York Sen. Hillary Clinton's win in Tuesday's Pennsylvania primary, Illinois Sen. Barack Obama remains the front-runner for the Democratic nomination. In the remaining primaries, Clinton has few opportunities to overtake him. Still, as Obama loses one big state after another, his potential weaknesses as a general-election candidate are being exposed. Obama lost Pennsylvania the same way he lost Ohio: by losing big to Clinton among white Catholics, white union members and white voters without college degrees. Those losses might not prevent him from winning the nomination, but Peter Brown of the independent Quinnipiac University poll says it certainly will matter in November, particularly in the big swing states that Democrats need to win. \"What Ohio and Pennsylvania have shown is that he has a serious problem with white, working-class Democrats,\" Brown says. \"If he has a serious problem with white, working-class Democrats, how do you think he is going to do with white, working-class independents and white, working-class soft Republicans?\" Missing a Key Constituency Some Democrats worry that as Obama inches closer to the 2,025 delegates he needs to win the nomination, his electoral coalition is looking hollowed out \u2014 missing the \"lunch bucket\" Democrats who are the foundation of the party's hopes for the White House. But Democratic strategist Steve McMahon isn't worried at all. \"The notion that Democrats won't come home \u2014 to Barack Obama or to Hillary Clinton \u2014 is, I think, a notion that's just not been proven true over time,\" he says. \"The Republicans who supposedly wouldn't come home for John McCain are coming home right now. That'll happen on the Democratic side, too.\" Strategist Anticipates Party Unity Another Democratic strategist, Peter Fenn, is worried about Obama's limited appeal to blue-collar voters, but he thinks that problem can be solved when and if the party unites behind Obama. \"I think there's no question that Barack Obama is going to have to appeal to those folks,\" Fenn says. \"The key now, I think, is for the Democrats not to take this race three, four, five more months into a basic circular firing squad. If that happens, and it gets more petty and more nasty and more bitter, then it is going to be difficult for either of the candidates to emerge with unity.\" Right now, the Democratic race is so divisive that unity looks elusive. Exit polls in Pennsylvania show that 43 percent of Clinton's voters would stay home or vote for McCain, the likely Republican nominee, if Obama were the Democratic nominee, and 29 percent of Obama's voters would do the same if Clinton were the nominee. Democratic consultant Tad Devine thinks Obama could compensate for losing a certain number of white, working-class votes because he has expanded the electorate. \"Sure, he's got work to do,\" Devine says, \"but ... he's demonstrating a lot of strength in a lot of areas. I mean, first of all, he's bringing new people into the process \u2014 we've got unprecedented registration. Secondly, the turnout is incredible in these primaries.\" Race Remains a Factor But there's another potential problem for Obama in Tuesday's exit polls: One in five white voters said race was a factor, and three in five white voters chose Clinton. \"A lot of voters in a lot of these states have never voted for an African-American candidate before,\" Devine says. \"This is simply a new experience for them, and many of them are going to have to confront this in the course of the campaign. I think right now, Hillary Clinton for them is sort of either a way station, you know, toward Obama or a signal that they're not quite ready to make that step. I don't think anybody knows the answer to that yet.\" That answer won't be apparent until after the party is able to unite behind a nominee \u2014 and that won't happen until one of these two heavyweight contenders figures out how to knock the other out of the race. Although Clinton was hoping her solid win in Pennsylvania would convince superdelegates to at least stay neutral until the end of the primaries in June, Obama picked up endorsements on Wednesday from Gov. Brad Henry of Oklahoma \u2014 a state Clinton won \u2014 and Audra Ostergard, a superdelegate from Nebraska, where Obama won. Clinton also added a superdelegate to her column: Rep. John Tanner of Tennessee.",

            "article_content": "Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton won the Pennsylvania primary Tuesday night with a 10 percent victory margin.  The win gives her momentum as the race moves to North Carolina and Indiana.  RENEE MONTAGNE, host: This is MORNING EDITION from NPR News. Good morning. I'm Renee Montagne. STEVE INSKEEP, host: And I'm Steve Inskeep. When Bill Clinton was president, his advisers sometimes spoke of a permanent campaign. Maybe it took Hillary Clinton to show what that really meant. She won Pennsylvania by 10 points yesterday, which is just impressive enough to keep going against Barack Obama. She still trails in delegates and money, but can claim momentum entering into the next primaries. We'll start our coverage this morning with NPR's David Greene. (Soundbite of song, \"I Won't Back Down\") DAVID GREENE: Hillary Clinton came into the ballroom to the strains of Tom Petty. (Soundbite of song, \"I Won't Back Down\") Mr. TOM PETTY (Singer, Songwriter): (Singing) You can stand me up at the gates of hell, but I won't back down. GREENE: Clinton said she and Barack Obama have spent much of the past six weeks traveling from town-to-town, chatting with voters. Senator HILLARY CLINTON (Democrat, New York; Democratic Presidential Candidate): You listened, and today you chose. (Soundbite of cheering) GREENE: Pennsylvanians chose in large numbers. Clinton won among women and voters older than 60, and she carried many of the state's smaller working class communities. Last night, she suggested she understands what it's like to be in an uphill battle. Sen. CLINTON: I'm in this race to fight for you. To fight\u2026 (Soundbite of cheering) Sen. CLINTON: \u2026to fight for everyone who's ever been counted out, for everyone fighting to pay the grocery bills or the medical bills, the credit card and mortgage payments, and the outrageous price of gas at the pump today. (Soundbite of cheering) Sen. CLINTON: You know, the pundits questioned whether Pennsylvanians would trust me with this charge, and tonight you showed you do. GREENE: The race turned negative in the final days, and voters interviewed at polling stations more often blamed Clinton than Obama. But Clinton and her advisers said the lesson from Pennsylvania should be that Obama failed to close the deal. Sen. CLINTON: He broke every spending record in this state trying to knock us out of the race. Well, the people of Pennsylvania had other ideas. (Soundbite of cheering) GREENE: One of those people is Shug Davis. She was at the victory party and didn't want a reporter to interrupt her celebration. Ms. SHUG DAVIS: Make it fast, buddy. I've waited a long time for this. GREENE: Davis is 58 years old. She is a professional dog trainer in Philadelphia, and she said too many people get the wrong impression of Hillary Clinton. Ms. DAVIS: She talks to you and she listens. I don't know why people feel that she's a bad person or insecure. She's a mensch, you know? She's a real person. GREENE: Davis acknowledged Clinton has a tough path to the nomination. Ms. DAVIS: But she has tenacity. She has fight. And she's not going to give up, and neither are we. She's going to win. It's not impossible. GREENE: You think it's okay if the superdelegates end up deciding the nomination for her? Ms. DAVIS: I personally don't care who ends up deciding who gives her the nomination. She deserves it. GREENE: Next up to decide who deserves it: the voters of North Carolina and Indiana. David Greene, NPR News, Philadelphia. Copyright \u00a9 2008 NPR.  All rights reserved.

The result: Little has changed in the race between Sen. Hillary Clinton and Sen. Barack Obama. Clinton was expected to win the state's Democratic primary. And she did. She was expected to do well with women and older voters and blue-collar households. And she did. Obama kept his demographic coalition together as well, winning the votes of African-Americans, young people and the more educated and affluent. \"What Ohio and Pennsylvania have shown is that [Obama] has a serious problem with white, working-class Democrats,\" said Peter Brown of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute. Brown says this may hurt Obama in the general election if he becomes the Democratic nominee. \"If he has a serious problem with white, working-class Democrats, how do you think he'll do with white, working-class independents and white, working-class soft Republicans?\" Brown says. Despite Clinton's 10 percent margin of victory, the delegate math may not change much for her. Because of the way the Democratic Party divvies up the state's 158 pledged delegates, she is likely to get perhaps 10 or 12 more than Obama. Before Pennsylvania, he had an edge of more than 160 pledged delegates. So it's on to North Carolina and Indiana. Both states vote on May 6, and together they offer nearly 30 more delegates than were at stake in Pennsylvania. North Carolina's demographics favor Obama. He leads in the polls there by an average of about 20 percentage points. Indiana, however, is a toss-up, and was the next campaign stop for both candidates. Addressing Supporters Before heading to Indiana, Clinton thanked her supporters at a victory party in Philadelphia for a strong showing that allows her to stay in the race for the Democratic nomination. Eight contests remain through June 3. \"I'm in this race for you, to fight for everyone who's ever been counted out,\" Clinton told a cheering crowd of supporters. She added that \"the American people don't quit, and they deserve a president that doesn't quit, either.\" \"Because of you, the tide is turning,\" Clinton added. The New York senator noted that she won in Pennsylvania despite being outspent substantially by Obama.  So she wasted no time in appealing to her supporters for funds, telling them to log on to her Web site and contribute. \"Tonight more than ever,\" she said, \"I need your help to continue this journey. ... The future of this campaign is in your hands.\" She left the stage to the strains of  John Mellencamp's \"This is Our Country.\" Meanwhile, the real Mellencamp was playing at an Obama rally in Evansville, Ind. Obama congratulated Clinton on her victory. Perhaps referring to the negativity of the Pennsylvania campaign, he added, \"It's easy to get caught up in the distractions and the silliness and the tit-for-tat that consumes our politics; the bickering that none of us are immune to, and that trivializes the profound issues \u2014 two wars, an economy in recession, a planet in peril.\" \"We're here,\" the Illinois senator added, \"because we can't afford to keep doing what we've been doing for another four years. We can't afford to play the same Washington games with the same Washington players and expect a different result.\" Stepped-Up Attacks In the days leading up to the contest, the candidates unleashed increasingly nasty attack ads. Clinton released a television ad in which an announcer says, \"It's the toughest job in the world,\" as images of the White House, Osama bin Laden, Hurricane Katrina and the attack on Pearl Harbor appear on the screen. \"Who do you think has what it takes?\" it asks. Obama's campaign countered with its own advertisement, \"He Has What It Takes.\" It characterizes Obama as someone who does not use fear to \"divide us.\" He has argued that Clinton's ads play to the \"politics of fear.\" The Long Campaign Political analysts are divided over the impact of a campaign that looks likely to last through the final contests on June 3. Democratic Party officials worry that the protracted race may be wounding both candidates in the eyes of voters. On balance ... this prolonged Democratic fight is a good thing for [presumptive Republican nominee Sen. John] McCain,\" said Dan Schnur, a GOP strategist who was McCain's communications director during his 2000 presidential bid. \"But there is no question,\" added Schnur, \"the one downside for him is that he is going to face a much better-prepared and better-tested opponent in the general election.\" But many veteran Democrats, such as strategist Bill Carrick, would like to see the Clinton-Obama duel come to an end. \"If I had a magic wand, I would end it,\" Carrick said, \"because I think this gets to be kind of like a fourth overtime in a basketball game. The players are exhausted; they're going to make mistakes. A lot of people in the Democratic Party would like to ...start preparing for the general election.\"",

            "article_content": "In preparation for Tuesday's primary, Hillary Clinton has been aggressively campaigning in Pennsylvania. She has worked to shore up support with women and working-class voters.  DAVID GREENE: I'm David Greene, traveling in Hillary Clinton. You know that one line Obama uttered about John McCain in Reading? Clinton decided to hammer him for it. Senator HILLARY CLINTON (Democrat, New York; Democratic Presidential Candidate): Senator Obama said today that John McCain would be better for the country than George Bush. GREENE: She began to work that crowd. Sen. CLINTON: Senator McCain thinks it's okay to keep our troops in Iraq for the next 100 years. Is that better than George Bush? Unidentified Group: No. Sen. CLINTON: Senator McCain will finish - will continue the failed economic policies of George Bush that have brought us deficits and increasing debt. Is that better than George Bush? GREENE: Clinton was in Johnstown, a hard scrabble community in western Pennsylvania where she's counting on support. Clinton's also hoping women turn out for her Tuesday, and she has spent time courting them these final days. At one town hall outside Philadelphia, she said her 15-month campaign has meant less time to go to the movies with her husband. Sen. CLINTON: So, you give up certain things, but it is well worth it. And then, of course, I always like to point out that I think I should get some extra points, you know, because it takes me so much longer to get ready than the men. (Soundbite of applause) Sen. CLINTON: Good to see you. Thanks. Unidentified Man #1: Pleasure to meet you. Sen. CLINTON: You guys look like you got some sun. Unidentified Man #1: We were down on the beach. Jersey shore\u2026 (Soundbite of laughter) GREENE: One stop yesterday was a family restaurant in the Philadelphia suburbs. Sen. CLINTON: Well, I'm glad to have your support on Tuesday. Great to see you all. Unidentified Man #1: Good luck. Unidentified Man #2: Thank you very much. Sen. CLINTON: Thank you. Unidentified Man #2: Very nice to meet you. GREENE: The senator, going table-to-table, met a nurse named Lisa Battersby(ph) who came to get breakfast and was surprised to find Clinton's entourage. Ms. LISA BATTERSBY (Nurse): I don't know. I got a lecture in the bathroom from some lady that had a big Hillary thing on. So\u2026 GREENE: Lisa said she's been getting tired of politics. Ms. BATTERSBY: Too much fighting, too much bickering. Like, the bickering is really a turnoff, though I would never go to McCain. GREENE: So she said she's going to go right after work Tuesday and vote for a Democrat. She's just not sure which one. Ms. BATTERSBY: I'm working that day. I'm going to walk in there at 7:30 and decide. GREENE: David Greene, NPR News, Philadelphia. Copyright \u00a9 2008 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "Michelle Obama has been called the secret edge in her husband's presidential campaign because of her charm, wit and down to earth style. But her plain speaking has also created controversy. Regardless, she's out on the stump up to four days a week. Her mission is to let voters see Illinois Sen. Barack Obama through her eyes. She campaigned in Indiana with the state's primary just three weeks away. In the middle of a workday afternoon, hundreds of people lined up to see her at Chapel Hill Junior High School in Indianapolis. The T-shirts and campaign buttons flew off the tables set up outside the school gym. The button that showed Michelle Obama with the words \"America's next first lady\" was especially popular. Kim Mills already had her outfit together. The Kokomo resident had a T-shirt that she had made showing her standing with Barack Obama in front of the Capitol. \"It looks like we're chummy,\" she said. Mills was part of a mixed-race crowd that was somewhat more black than white, more female than male. Many of these people left work to be here because they adore Barack Obama, and they're pretty crazy about Michelle, too. The reason for that's simple, said Mills. \"She's real.\" Real, maybe, but hardly average: Michelle Obama is nearly six feet tall.  She is a Harvard-educated lawyer like her husband and can deliver a 40-minute speech without notes. She routinely brought the crowd to its feet, especially when she mentioned her husband. Speaking in the school gym, Obama told supporters, \"I know the only person in this race who has a chance of creating a different version of this nation and how we work together, the only person who can do that is my husband, Barack Obama.\" This is part of the speech that she has been delivering for the past year, according to the campaign. But she throws in new details, depending on the current state of the race. In Indiana, she defended her husband \u2014 and herself \u2014 from the flak that came their way after Obama said that the economic frustrations of small-town Americans have left them bitter, so they \"cling\" to guns and religion. \"There's been a whole lot of talk about elitism,\" she said, \"so one of my jobs is to tell you who we are and how we look at the world.\" She said she looks at the world from the point of view of the working-class community she grew up in on Chicago's South Side. Every candidate's spouse plays a different role during a campaign. When Bill Clinton speaks for his wife, New York Sen. Hillary Clinton, the former president goes into wonkish detail on her policy proposals, unlike Michelle Obama. Instead, Obama uses details from her life story, and her husband's, to demonstrate the need for the policies he proposes, such as help for students struggling with the high cost of college. \"Barack and I know this all too well ,\" she said, noting that they each borrowed money to pay for two degrees from Ivy League schools. \"We are just a few years outside of paying down our student loan debt,\" she said, which was made possible because of her husband's two best-selling books. Her speech offers a lot of these little behind-the-scenes glimpses of the Obama family, such as when she explains that her campaign appearances are usually day trips because she'll only stay away from her two young daughters one night a week. Earlier in the campaign, some of Obama's efforts to humanize her family image fell flat. She was criticized for describing her husband as \"snore-y and stinky\" in the morning. One pundit called that \"emasculating.\" In February, Michelle Obama stirred up a bigger controversy when she said, \"For the first time in my adult life, I am proud of my country.\" She said she was referring to her pride in the grassroots support for her husband's campaign. But critics pounced, and Cindy McCain, wife of presumptive Republican nominee John McCain, commented that she has always been proud of her country. In the central Indiana town of Anderson, where Obama made her third speech of the day, supporter Michael Adkins said he understands the controversy.  He has a friend who thinks that Obama sounds angry, for instance, but he sees it differently. \"She's stoked up for the challenge ahead,\" he said. \"I think she's very dedicated. I don't think it's so much anger as real hope.\" In Indianapolis, DeBrice Walker put it this way: Michelle Obama needs to be outspoken. \"You have to be in this day and age,\" said Walker. \"We got crazy stuff going on.\" Anyway, said Walker, Michelle Obama's no more outspoken than former former first lady Hillary Clinton.",

Also this week, John McCain gave his first major economic speech as the presumptive GOP nominee. Polls show a desire for change of party in the White House, but McCain is running even with Democratic rivals.  This is MORNING EDITION from NPR News. I'm Lynn Neary. STEVE INSKEEP, host: And I'm Steve Inskeep. All three presidential candidates make time to meet today with a man whose vote they do not need. He's a man that each candidate would hope to work with after winning the White House. British Prime Minister Gordon Brown is in Washington. He meets the candidates late in a busy week. Republican John McCain announced his economic plans. Democrats Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama finished a debate in Pennsylvania last night. NPR's news analyst Juan Williams was listening. And Juan, do either of the Democrats have reason to be, shall we say, bitter? JUAN WILLIAMS: Well, Steve, you know, it's a - I think what you saw last night really is evidence of the tenor of the campaign as it stands right now. You know, there're no draws in politics. And at the moment neither side can win outright with the chessboard as it is. Clearly Senator Obama has the better position. He has the lead in terms of pledged delegates and votes. And so Senator Clinton is hard-pressed to catch him. And so it's like two chess players waiting for an opening to show the voters exactly how the game progresses. And at the moment what you have is Clinton looking for a stumble, you know, that would say he can't be elected. And you have Obama looking for her to stumble and saying it's time for her to get out. So the bitterness is pretty high right now. INSKEEP: And, of course, when we say bitter we're referring to Barack Obama's remark about white voters of a certain kind being bitter and turning to God and guns, among other things. Obama was asked about that last night. What did he say? WILLIAMS: Well, basically he tried to get away from it and say, you know, that he had been misunderstood. That he had spoken badly, was inarticulate, he said. Really the first 40 minutes of the debate they spent discussing the controversial Reverend Jeremiah Wright, and then as you said, this statement about bitter voters clinging to guns and religion. And so Senator Obama was on the defensive, and, you know, he got bruised - he got knocked up pretty good by both sides. INSKEEP: Although, let me ask about the complaint that the makes as I look at this account of the debate. He argued that it's really unfair of people to grab a single statement, just beat it into the ground and repeat it again and again. He even reminds Hillary Clinton of her statement about not being the kind of person who would bake cookies back in 1992. Is there something to that complaint? WILLIAMS: Well, no, because this is hardball politics, and what we saw yesterday is a real effort by the moderators - Charlie Gibson and George Stephanopoulos of ABC - as well as Senator Clinton to challenge Senator Obama on a really tight question. Is he electable in the fall versus John McCain? Can he withstand a barrage on these very difficult questions? Mrs. Clinton made it very clear that Democrats need to win in the fall, and seemed to make the case that Obama is not yet prepared. But when she was asked whether Obama can win versus McCain, she said yes, yes, yes. And when Senator Obama was asked whether or not Hillary Clinton can win in the fall, he said yes. Neither of them committed, however, to have the other one on the ticket. So it was interesting moment here in the balance. INSKEEP: And as they debate, what is John McCain saying that he would do if he is elected president as the Republican? WILLIAMS: Well, it's interesting. This week he gave a very important speech on the economy. John McCain is saying I am still a man who believes in tax cuts in the sort of Reagan/Bush supply-side theory of economics. He wants to eliminate the alternative minimum tax. He wants to slash corporate taxes. For working-class people, the only big offer he had was to suspend the federal gasoline tax for the summer from Memorial Day to Labor Day. INSKEEP: Does McCain also have conservatives in mind as he talks about tax cuts? WILLIAMS: Absolutely, because what he's trying to do is make it clear that, you know, while he's been a maverick and sometimes diverted himself from the Republican line, here he is saying now to corporate Republicans, here he is now saying to people who might be looking at a third party challenge - that John McCain is a Republican. You can trust him. You can trust him not only on the war, but you can trust him in terms of economic policy. INSKEEP: Analysis from NPR's Juan Williams. Juan, thanks very much.

            "article_content": "Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama on Sunday are attending a \"compassion forum\" in Pennsylvania. But compassion has been at a premium lately as the two spar over Obama's remarks about how working-class voters are \"bitter.\" What Obama said was that Pennsylvania's small town voters are bitter about losing jobs and that to explain their frustrations, they \"cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who aren't like them.\" Obama said Saturday that he deeply regretted if the way in which he worded his statement had offended people. Much of the talk on the Sunday TV news shows focused on the comment. \"This could be the kind of political issue that Karl Rove and the Republicans use to beat us over the head with and that would be a tragic thing,\" said Clinton supporter and Indiana Democratic Sen. Evan Bayh on CNN's Late Edition. Clinton is also giving Obama a verbal thrashing. At a campaign stop on Sunday in Scranton, Pa., Clinton told reporters that Obama's comment was \"elitist and divisive.\" \"What people are looking for is an explanation: What does he really believe? How does he see the people here in this neighborhood, throughout Pennsylvania, Indiana, North Carolina, other places in our country?\" Clinton said. Still, Sunday's Scranton Times Tribune endorsed Obama, calling Clinton \"a political lightning rod.\" Pennsylvania Democratic Sen. Bob Casey has also endorsed Obama, and he assured CNN's Late Edition on Sunday that voters in his state's primary a week from Tuesday will not judge Obama by one statement. \"I think they understand the point he was trying to make, and I think that in the end, they're going to vote for one or the other candidate based upon who they are, their record,\" Casey says. \"I have great confidence as we go forward, Barack Obama's values, his heart, his commitment to his faith and his commitment to change is going be a significant factor in him being the nominee,\" Casey said. And on the Internet, a video clip is now circulating of Obama talking about the same kind of blue-collar voters with interviewer Charlie Rose in November 2004. Pollster and Franklin and Marshall College political scientist Terry Madonna says Obama has a lot more explaining to do before the April 22 Pennsylvania primary. \"Unless he figures out a way to explain it in manner that makes more sense, I think this is probably going to damage his campaign in this state,\" Madonna said. Madonna said tonight's forum in Pennsylvania and a debate on Wednesday could be Obama's best chances to make further explanations.",

Barack Obama.\n                \n                    \n                    Evie Stone, NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Fred Chamberlain attempts to inflate a 'Boilermakers for Change' blimp across the street from an event in Levittown, Pa., for Illinois Sen. Barack Obama. The next presidential primary for the Democrats is in Pennsylvania on April 22.  It's a state that  appears to be tailor-made for New York Sen. Hillary Clinton: Its residents are whiter, older and less educated and affluent than the rest of the country. Clinton is counting on her strongest supporters \u2014 white working-class voters \u2014 to help her win the state. But Illinois Sen. Barack Obama, who has built his string of victories with the support of upscale affluent voters, is now trying hard to win support from the so-called \"lunch-bucket\" Democrats. Hard-pressed communities like Levittown, Pa., have been the bedrock of Clinton's support. The working-class suburb of Philadelphia was built in the 1950s for returning World War II veterans who wanted a house, a yard and a nice place to raise their kids. The residents held good jobs at nearby steel mills, rubber plants and car factories, but many of those jobs are gone now. Obama is trying to make inroads with these lunch-bucket Democrats, and residents like Fred Chamberlain, the vice president of the local boilermakers union, are campaigning for him. Nostalgic for Last Decade's Prosperity Chamberlain says he has encountered some resistance, in part because of Pennsylvania voters' nostalgia for the economic prosperity of the 1990s. \"The middle class \u2014 we've been taking it on the chin for a little while now,\" Chamberlain says. \"A lot of people don't like change. They like the Clinton years, and they felt comfortable with the Clinton years. And now they would like to have the Clinton years back.\" There is something else Chamberlain encounters when he canvasses door to door for Obama in Levittown: the issue of race. \"As we get out here, we hear all the time, 'You know, I'm not so sure about voting for an African-American,'\" he says. On a recent night at Bailey's Bar and Grille in Levittown, the place was filled with the type of voters Clinton can depend on and Obama wants to win. Michael Shefmyer, the bouncer, supports Clinton. \"She just seems more in touch with people than Barack Obama does,\" he says. But plumber Bill Goldy says he is inclined to support Obama. \"He doesn't take contributions from the \u2014 what do you want to call them? \u2014 the lobbyists. It's just time for a change, you know. She was already there. She made her money. The Clintons made $109 million since he left office.\" Clinton's Lead Narrows Clinton is still ahead in the polls in Pennsylvania, but her lead is shrinking, and Obama's efforts to reach out to voters in working-class suburbs like Levittown may help him narrow the gap. If Obama ends up winning the nomination, he may need these core Democratic voters in November much more than he needs them on April 22. Clinton has said Obama will be a weak nominee because he cannot connect with white working-class voters, and Democrats need to carry those voters in order to win big swing states like Ohio and Pennsylvania. If Obama wins or comes very close in Pennsylvania, he could prove her wrong. After Pennsylvania, he will not have many other chances.",

            "article_content": "The third of three reports In a three-part series, NPR's David Greene travels across Pennsylvania to find out what's on voters' minds ahead of the state's April 22 primary. Browse our previous reports: Part One:Pittsburgh voters at a local market tell NPR that Bill Clinton's legacy looms over the state's upcoming primary.  Part Two:Philadelphia voters talk about how race, the economy and the war have influenced their decisions ahead of the state's primary. Pennsylvania in three weeks will be the site of the next big contest between New York Sen. Hillary Clinton and Illinois Sen. Barack Obama. To get a sense of what's on Pennsylvanians' minds ahead of the April 22 primary, NPR talked to voters at food markets across the state. First we stopped in Philadelphia, a Democratic stronghold with a large African-American population, where voters spoke about the role that race has played in the campaign. In Pittsburgh, white working-class voters said that Clinton's candidacy is still closely tied to her husband's legacy. And in Lancaster, the heart of Pennsylvania Dutch Country, we talked to voters in what is largely considered a swing area of the state. At the Lancaster Central Market, Vicky Glosser works the register at an ice cream and salad retail food stand. Glosser says she is still undecided about which candidate to support. Although she is a registered Republican, she says she is leaning toward Obama. \"He's like Kennedy,\" Glosser says, adding, \"I think he's someone who could have made a difference if he really had had a chance.\" A few stalls away, a spice seller named Jim Zinc says he is leaning toward Clinton.  But he's still not clear whom he will support in the primary. \"I really didn't do a lot of prep, because I never thought we'd get to the point where Pennsylvania would matter a whole lot,\" he says. His customer Beth Becker has arrived to pick up ingredients for a soup and joins the conversation. She says that she has not made up her mind yet, and as a Democrat, she says that Obama still has more to prove. \"My concern with Barack Obama is, I haven't heard enough from him on the Middle East. And being a Jewish person, that is very important to me,\" she says. \"I want to hear support for a peace process \u2014 being engaged in a peace process.\" Pennsylvania voters discuss the presidential race and upcoming primary.

NPR talked to voters there about Pennsylvania's upcoming primary. Every city has a quirky neighborhood that everyone knows. In Pittsburgh, it's the Strip District, full of old warehouses and a different scent coming from each family-run shop. A visit to Wholey's Fish Market yielded some interesting perspectives on the candidates as Pennsylvania's Democratic primary approaches \u2013 and one of the biggest factors was Bill. Peggy Kisslinger, a retired schoolteacher, recently made a trip to Wholey's Fish Market. Like many white, working-class voters in Western Pennsylvania, she says she supports New York Sen. Hillary Clinton. The voting group has voted overwhelmingly for Clinton in primaries in states such as Ohio, Rhode Island and Wisconsin. \"It's time for a woman to get the job,\" Kisslinger says. \"I think that it's our turn, and Obama would make an excellent running mate. And I hope he won't be too proud to accept that.\" Like many voters in this area, however, she also worries that Clinton's candidacy is too tied up in her husband's legacy and his affair with then-White House intern Monica Lewinsky. If Clinton becomes the nominee, Kisslinger says, \"I think a lot of people are afraid they're going to get too much Bill Clinton.\" The former president's name comes up frequently at the fish market \u2013 even though Hillary Clinton has spent six years in the U.S. Senate and has waged a long presidential campaign. Another shopper and construction worker, Jim Gagich, is a registered Republican who voted for Bill Clinton. He says he would not vote for Hillary Clinton, largely because of the way she handled her husband's affair a decade ago. He believes it didn't demonstrate leadership on her part. \"I think a lot of people would have respected her more if she would have smacked him upside the head,\" Gagich says. \"I don't cotton to these wives standing there, acting like they are supporting their husbands through something like that. I don't think my wife would, and I wouldn't respect her if she did.\" Katerina Pavelle, who came to the fish market with her husband for sushi, says she is still undecided about who to vote for on April 22. She likes Illinois Sen. Barack Obama and has contributed $60 to his campaign, but she says she's now leaning toward Clinton because she disliked a speech Obama gave against the North American Trade Agreement. Pavelle is taking a closer look at what she calls Clinton's strength. \"I like the fact that she'll probably make a better president than Bill Clinton,\" Pavelle says. \"I think she's smarter of the two of them anyhow, and she pursues her goals with what some people call ruthlessness.\" But that same ruthlessness has given her husband, Scott, pause and makes him think he'll vote for Obama. He feels like Clinton can be a divisive figure, although she did impress him during her husband's affair. \"She was held up in a public spotlight as a woman scorned, and she didn't turn around and scream in the cameras or in public,\" he says. \"I'm sure he just lost a couple yards of skin in private about it.\" Katerina Pavelle says this behavior shows Clinton is professional and doesn't buckle under pressure \u2014 a trait she hopes Clinton would carry with her to the White House should she earn the nomination. When Clinton embarked on her run for president, she said she needed to reintroduce herself to the country. But Pittsburgh voters seem to be looking more closely at her past.

            "article_content": "Follow McCain's candidacy in photographs.\n                hide caption In a presidential election year in which a black man and a white woman are each staging historic candidacies, John McCain \u2014 the maverick Republican \u2014 may be the most radical party nominee. While both New York Sen. Hillary Clinton and Illinois Sen. Barack Obama are making unprecedented bids for the Democratic nomination, both are also orthodox party members who deviate very little from the mainstream. The same can't be said for McCain, the presumptive GOP nominee. As fellow Republican and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich sums it up: \"John McCain couldn't be a status quo person if his life depended on it.\" Gingrich knows something about boom-and-bust cycles in politics. Right now with the Republican Party in retreat, he thinks McCain might be just the change the party needs. \"McCain may turn out to be a surprisingly timely break in what would otherwise have been, I think, a Republican disaster,\" Gingrich said. \"His willingness to do what he believes in, and not care about the political conventions will certainly break up both the pattern of domination by the regular Republican establishment and the pattern of movement conservatives defining the party.\" McCain won the nomination in spite of opposition from large wings of the Republican establishment and the conservative base. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), one of McCain's closest allies in the Senate, says McCain could now have a profound effect on his party. \"There's aspects of John McCain's philosophy as a Republican that will tie us back to those principles that really made the party different from Democrats, and there's also an aspect of John McCain that will take the party in a new direction: global climate change, campaign finance reform, immigration reform, issues that present a new ideology. That we ought to be embracing Democrats, that it's not a crime in the McCain Republican Party to work with Democrats for the greater good,\" Graham said. McCain himself wears his bipartisan credentials on his sleeve. After the March 4 primaries, he said, \"The American people's patience is at an end for politicians who value ambition over principle, and for partisanship that is less a contest of ideas than an uncivil brawl over the spoils of power.\" \"McCainism,\" out of necessity, could be a rejection of the hyper-partisanship of President Bush's approach to governing and Karl Rove's approach to winning elections. As a president, McCain could not expect to govern without a lot of Democratic support in Congress. As a candidate, McCain could not win the White House without the votes of independent and swing voters. Gingrich says that McCain is determined to figure out how to have a governing coalition that encompasses about 60 percent of the country. \"He understands that the red-versus-blue base mobilization is crazy in the long run. It works for one election. Then it is destructive,\" he said. In 1992, former President Bill Clinton called himself a \"new Democrat\" when he wanted to move his party to the center. In 2000, Bush called himself a \"compassionate conservative\" when he wanted to break with the hard edge of the Gingrich revolution. There is no slogan yet for McCain's brand of conservatism. But his supporters describe him as a Republican reformer ready to tackle campaign finance, immigration, entitlements, earmarks and the tax code. And they say that he would also try to appeal to a group of swing voters who have been hard for more traditional Republican candidates to reach: the suburban working-class, or as Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty calls them, the \"Sam's Club Republicans\" \u2014 as opposed to \"country club\" Republicans. Sam's Club voters, Pawlenty says, care about getting their children a good education and a shot at a better life \u2014 without being overburdened with taxes. \"They're interested in school funding and reform, and they're worried about health care costs,\" Pawlenty says. \"And they want to know, without having the government take it over, can you do something to help them make health care more affordable. And on each of those, John McCain has spoken pretty strongly in ways that I think would be attractive to a Sam's Club Republican.\" When it comes to bread-and-butter issues, the Democrats have a long-standing advantage. McCain's supporters say in the next six months, he must unveil his own agenda on the mortgage market crisis, the economy and energy. Michael Gerson is a former Bush speechwriter and a McCain admirer who says McCain will need to focus more on domestic issues. \"The major criticism of John McCain you hear among colleagues on Capitol Hill and others is that he is engaged on the international front. He is not particularly intellectually engaged on this domestic front, and he is going to need to be in this election, because we've moved from an international focus to a much more domestic focus,\" he said. Others are even more skeptical for different reasons. Bill Galston, a former Clinton White House domestic policy aide and a supporter of Hillary Clinton, says the question is whether McCain can be a Theodore Roosevelt for the 21st century. \"And the answer is, it would depend on which President McCain showed up the day after his inauguration. Because his campaign right now is a promiscuous heap of ideas that will not cohere in one administration,\" Galston says. \"Does he represent a departure from encrusted Republican orthodoxy? And the answer is yes, absolutely. But then you can ask a different set of questions.\" Galston says despite McCain's break with his party on a long list of issues \u2014 from climate change to torture \u2014 the task of moving the GOP in his direction will be next to impossible. McCain's task will be even harder this year. He will try to chart a new path for Republicans in a campaign where the Democrats will be spending all of their energy trying to frame him as nothing more than a carbon copy of Bush.",

Adding Up the Pledged Delegates It has become increasingly unlikely that either candidate will be able to clinch the nomination on pledged delegates alone. Obama remains ahead on this count, with a lead of 142 pledged delegates over Clinton. There are 540 pledged delegates at stake in upcoming contests, according to The Associated Press. The Democratic Party awards pledged delegates proportionally, based on the popular vote. That will make it difficult for either candidate to roll up a huge lead in the pledged delegate count in the contests that remain. That's because in a close contest, the candidate who loses the popular vote could end up with as many delegates as the winner. (In Nevada, Obama actually got more delegates than Clinton, even though she won the state's caucuses.) To secure the nomination ahead of the convention, a Democratic candidate needs to accrue 2,025 total delegates \u2014 both the pledged kind and superdelegates. Neither candidate is close to the final tally needed. Shoring Up the Support of Superdelegates With the division of the pledged delegates so close, the nomination may come down to which candidate makes the most persuasive argument to the superdelegates. Clinton has commitments from more superdelegates than Obama, 242 to 207. There are roughly 800 superdelegates \u2014 mostly congressmen and governors, as well as members of the Democratic National Committee. While about half of the superdelegates have committed to a candidate, they are free to change their minds before the convention. (Rep. John Lewis, a prominent Civil Rights era leader, recently switched his support from Clinton to Obama). Will Michigan and Florida Count? The fight for the party's nomination is a muddle, in part, because the Democrats have not yet decided what to do with the delegates from Michigan and Florida. On Wednesday, the Democratic governor of Michigan and the Republican governor of Florida urged the national party to allow those delegates to count at the national convention. The chairman of the national party, Howard Dean, told NPR on Wednesday that, with regard to Michigan and Florida, \"If you change the rules in the middle of the game, you disadvantage one candidate.\" He added that the two states could petition the national party's rules committee by setting forth a new plan for selecting delegates. Or they could appeal to the party's credentials committee in July to ask for the delegates to be seated at the convention. The DNC stripped Florida and Michigan of their delegates when state party officials scheduled their primaries earlier than the national party would have liked. Clinton stayed on the ballot in those states. Obama remained on the ballot only in Florida but did not campaign there. Clinton technically \"won\" those contests, even though there were no actual delegates to award. If the Florida and Michigan contests end up counting, Clinton could win the delegates in those states and also be ahead in the popular vote by more than 40,000 votes. The Next Contests on the Calendar None of the upcoming contests are likely to be decisive. The Mississippi primary is on Tuesday; Obama could benefit from the state's 37.4 percent African-American population. African-Americans have overwhelmingly supported Obama in other Southern states, such as South Carolina and Louisiana. Neither contest, though, will provide enough delegates to significantly stretch Obama's lead. Clinton is expected to do well in the Pennsylvania primary on April 22, since the state has a large white, working-class, union-heavy population, much like the demographics of Ohio, where Clinton won on Tuesday. But she, too, is unlikely to pick up enough delegates there to significantly close the gap. The Money Chase Traditionally, a presidential candidate who lags in the polls this late in the nominating process sees his cash flow dry up. But both Clinton and Obama continue to have financial success, and there's no evidence that the intra-party battle will hurt campaign contributions. Obama and Clinton are raising more money than any candidate has ever raised in a contested primary contest. Clinton has said she raised $35 million in February; Obama's campaign says it took in substantially more than that. The real numbers \u2014 including the spending \u2014 won't be known until the next Federal Election Commission filings are due on March 20. The Obama campaign is hedging on whether it will take public financing in the fall, assuming he is the nominee. Public financing would give him $84 million from the government, or roughly $1.25 million per day between the convention and Election Day. But it seems clear that he could raise more money privately. Sharing the Democratic Ticket One way for the Democrats to settle this close race: The two candidates could share the Democratic ticket \u2014 with one candidate as the presidential nominee and the other as the running mate. The question then not only becomes who would receive the most prominent billing, but also whether it makes political sense to have the other as a running mate. On Wednesday, Clinton told CBS News that she would be willing to share the Democratic ballot with Obama, provided she is \"first on the ticket\" \u2014 that is, with him as her vice presidential running mate. She went on to say, \"The people of Ohio said very clearly it should be me,\" referring to her win the previous night. The Obama camp did not comment on Clinton's statement and has said that any vice presidential talks are premature. Multiple Ballots at the Democratic Convention There is a distinct possibility that neither candidate will arrive in Denver in August with enough delegates to sew up the nomination. That could cause problems for the Democrats \u2014 to have two candidates slamming each other for the next five months, while Arizona Sen. John McCain unifies the Republican Party and prepares for the nomination. History shows the pitfalls of such a scenario: The last time the Democratic convention went past the first ballot for a presidential candidate was in 1952, when the party needed three ballots to nominate Adlai Stevenson. Stevenson lost the election to President Eisenhower. One reason the Democrats have had more and longer-lasting multi-ballot nominating conventions is because, from their first convention in 1832 until they changed the rule at the 1936 convention, it took a two-thirds majority to decide the presidential or vice-presidential nomination. The Republicans have always used a simple majority. Reporting and research by David Greene, Don Gonyea, Peter Overby, Ken Rudin, Cory Turner, Laurel Wamsley. Written by Nancy Cook.",

Mike Huckabee and his wife Janet visit the Fort Worth Stockyards on Feb. 29. The Democratic presidential candidates spent the final day before the March 4 primaries in Texas, Ohio, Rhode Island and Vermont in a frenzy of last-minute campaigning and barb-trading. With just hours to go before the polls open, New York Sen. Hillary Clinton and Illinois Sen. Barack Obama were busy wooing a dizzying array of voting blocs \u2014 from Hispanics to women to veterans to the working class. Clinton started the day campaigning in Ohio before making her way to Texas midday. Obama focused his efforts on Texas, courting veterans in San Antonio and then wrapping up with a late-night rally in Houston. He told voters he is optimistic about winning the March 4 contests but has not discounted Clinton. \"Sen. Clinton is running a tenacious campaign,\" Obama said. \"She is a hardworking candidate who brings to bear enormous resources. We're working as hard as we can to try to do well.\" All the while, the two candidates attacked each other on foreign policy, the war, health care and international trade agreements. Tuesday's contests are seen as make-or-break for Clinton, who has lost 11 straight contests to Obama. The latest polls show Obama with a small lead over Clinton in Texas, though she retains a slight edge in Ohio. Ohio has 141 delegates at stake Tuesday; Texas, 193. Many observers believe Clinton must win both states if she is to remain in the race. \"I'm just getting warmed up,\" Clinton told the Associated Press on Monday, looking beyond the March 4 contests. Clinton will be under increased pressure to withdraw from the race if she fails to win both Texas and Ohio. Obama's task on Tuesday is two-fold: He hopes to pick up enough delegates to definitively portray himself as the party's inevitable nominee and at the same time force Clinton from the race. But just one day before the March 4 contests, he also had to defend his relationship with Chicago businessman and political fundraiser Antoin \"Tony\" Rezko, who is facing federal corruption charges in a Chicago court. Obama was questioned about his purchase of a strip of land adjacent to his house from Rezko. \"I have been very open about what I called a boneheaded move,\" Obama said. Obama also spent Monday fending off allegations that he had overstated his opposition to NAFTA to win votes in Ohio, where the North American Free Trade Agreement is highly unpopular. He told reporters that his campaign never gave Canada back-channel assurances that his criticism of NAFTA amounted to political posturing. Ohio has the seventh-highest unemployment rate in the country, after hemorrhaging its base of blue-collar manufacturing jobs. Further south, in Texas, a state with a large number of military bases, Clinton has renewed her argument that she is the more experienced candidate and, therefore, better prepared for the Oval Office. She has been running an ad in the Lone Star State that features a red phone ringing in the middle of the night with news of a national disaster. The ad asks viewers which Democratic presidential candidate they would prefer to have on the other end of the line. Obama has countered the experience argument by reminding voters that Clinton voted to authorize the use of force in Iraq \u2014 a vote that he calls an error in judgment on her part. The key March 4 states of Ohio and Texas are home to several different voting groups, including Hispanics, blue-collar workers, African-Americans and women. As the candidates traverse the states, they have adjusted their message to target the listener. For Hispanic voters, there have been Spanish-language radio advertisements. For the college-age voters, there are ads on popular radio stations, along with candidate pages on social networking sites such as Facebook. For blue-collar workers, rallies have centered on economic issues and NAFTA-bashing. The Republican candidates also campaigned in Texas, although in a less contentious battle. If Arizona Sen. John McCain wins there, he will finally have enough delegates to clinch the Republican presidential nomination. He ended the day in Lubbock and Waco. His chief rival, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, who has 252 delegates compared with McCain's 912, told supporters, \"It ain't over until Texas says it's over.\" He held campaign events in Dallas, Midland, San Antonio and Houston. Rep. Ron Paul of Texas remains in the race, but first things first: He has to dispatch a Republican challenger for his House seat in Tuesday's primary. From NPR reports and The Associated Press",

            "article_content": "Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton campaigned in Ohio on Sunday ahead of Tuesday's primary. Many analysts say the state is a must-win for Clinton if she wants to stay in the hunt for the nomination.  JACKI LYDEN, host: From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Jacki Lyden. Andrea Seabrook is away. Today the Democratic nominating contest came down to one town in South central Ohio - the town of Westerville, just outside of Columbus. Hillary Clinton spoke there at a morning rally at West High School. Senator HILLARY CLINTON (Democrat, New York; Presidential Candidate): And we need a president who can turn this economy around and get it working again to produce the jobs with rising income. (Soundbite of applause) Sen. CLINTON: That is especially important for Ohio. LYDEN: In the afternoon it was Barack Obama, not far away at Central High. Senator BARACK OBAMA (Democrat, Illinois; Presidential Candidate): We're going to start by addressing the cost crisis that so many families are going through. The fact that even though wages have been stagnant, people's expenses keep going up and up and up. And we want to make sure that we're making day-to-day life more and more affordable for the average person. LYDEN: NPR's David Greene and Don Gonyea are traveling at lightning speeds with the rival campaigns, and David Greene is on the line with me now. Hi there, David. DAVID GREENE: Hi, Jacki. LYDEN: I hope we don't lose you and the bus doesn't pull away in the middle of this little talk. GREENE: We're on a bus crossing the state of Ohio. I'm in a bus a couple of buses behind Hillary Clinton's bus. She just began a bus tour the rest of the day here. LYDEN: Well, we know that the senator from New York is trying to pull off the victory she won in New Hampshire eight weeks ago. Seems like a long time. What issues enabled her to win that race? GREENE: In the final days of New Hampshire, Jacki, you know, we had the tear-up. Hillary Clinton got teary eyed and a lot of voters in New Hampshire thought that that made a difference for them. But Barack Obama was really moving in the polls until the last couple of days. And then the Clinton campaign really feels like she was able to win over the very latest deciders. And voters said that they were really focusing on the issues as opposed to personality. And I think that's a model that they're hoping to recreate, especially here in Ohio. And if you listen to Hillary Clinton in these speeches, she finishes off by saying, you know, some people vote based on personality. I want you to treat this like a hiring decision. Talk to me about who you want to hire as president, both when it comes to the economy and foreign policies. So if they look back to New Hampshire, they'd love to recreate that in the final days. LYDEN: How is the Clinton campaign aiming at different voters in Ohio as compared to Texas? GREENE: Well, certainly there's more of an economic message in Ohio. The state has one of the highest unemployment rates in the country. In Texas, in contrast, in the last day or so she's focused much more on foreign policy, saying that she'd be a stronger commander-in-chief. She had an ad running with a phone ringing at the White House in the middle of the night, suggesting at three in the morning if that call comes through and there's a crisis, she'd be the person that Americans would want in there. And of course, there are different voters that the campaign is going after. White working class voters, the types of voters that have stuck with Hillary Clinton before, a lot of them in Ohio. And in Texas you have a large number of Latino voters and they have stuck with her. We look at a state like California, they helped Hillary Clinton pull off a victory there and they're hoping for the same thing in Texas. LYDEN: Speaking of the ads, Obama is running a lot more than Hillary Clinton. Is she taking note of this somehow? GREENE: Her campaign certainly is. The campaign actually had a memo to reporters, which suggested that the media has anointed Barack Obama the frontrunner. They say that he's like it, spending a lot more money, and they're using that to set expectations, suggesting now that since he is spending so much money he has been seen as the frontrunner. If he doesn't pull off wins in all the states on Tuesday, they're suggesting that might show he has a problem. LYDEN: Thanks a lot, David. That's NPR's David Greene with the Clinton campaign in Ohio.

In one of those states, Rhode Island, Hillary Clinton is hoping to win delegates and end Barack Obama's winning streak.  SCOTT SIMON, Host: NPR's Nancy Cook reports. NANCY COOK: Pawtucket, Rhode Island is a small working-class city full of old factories and mill buildings that are now being turned into fancy lofts. Most of the residents are immigrants or blue-collar workers who have lived here their whole lives in triple-decker houses or small bungalows that sit just a couple feet apart. Thirty-eight year old Toni Windcoup(ph) is trying to get out the vote for Barack Obama. She's never been politically active before, but even her 8-year-old daughter, Morgan(ph), who does not plan to vote on Tuesday, is jazzed about Obama. MORGAN WINDCOUP: Because he's really going to help kids learn more and I would like to see that to get into college so I can cook and do different recipes... COOK: (Unintelligible) an unscientific survey of voters living on Columbine Street, find some but not all agreeing with Morgan. Megan Wagner(ph) is a waitress at the Olive Garden restaurant. She has her hands full with trying to get her two young kids to sit down at breakfast. But she's not too busy to talk politics. MEGAN WAGNER: I think either way it's going to be just a good choice, I'm just a little torn up to what I'm going to be doing. Like, at first I was completely Hillary, but after her explained to me a little bit about the medical situation and what her plans are and what his plans are, I'm leaning a little more towards Obama. COOK: A few doors down Claire Lollier(ph) says she 82, a life-long Democrat and leaning towards Clinton. CLAIRE LOLLIER: She's real smart. She's a real smart lady. Anyway, she does know what she's talking about. Let's put it that way. COOK: One thing that few people here ever suspected would happen is that suddenly Rhode Island's primary is getting noticed, says Brown University's Darrell West. DARRELL WEST: Rhode Island always has been the off-Broadway political venue. Nobody really pays much attention to the state, so people here are very excited that suddenly our vote really matters. It actually could be decisive along with that of Ohio and Texas, so I think turnout is going to be up substantially. COOK: Earlier in the week, Clinton was here and talked about the economic issues important to Rhode Islanders, home foreclosures and jobs moving overseas. After the rally, Scott Duhamel, the business rep for the local painter's union said he's voting for Clinton. SCOTT DUHAMEL: We're supporting the Senator for a number of reasons and largely economical I would say. Some of the things that concern us most is the healthcare and the country's economy as, you know, most labor unions are concerned about that. We think that she's probably the most electable candidate although I will tell you quite clearly, the last Dem standing. We'll be there for whoever that may be. COOK: Nancy Cook, NPR News.

            "article_content": "Little noticed amid the hubbub over Texas and Ohio, the Ocean State holds its presidential primary March 4. Darrell West of Brown University looks at who's voting for whom.  ALISON STEWART, host: The smallest state in the union gets a big role next week. Rhode Island's 32 delegates are up for grabs on March 4th. Now, normally, Rhode Island, a land I love, I'm afraid to say would normally be just kind of a political blip. But this year, every delegate matters to Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. Darrell West is the director of the Taubman Center for Public Policy at my alma mater, Brown University. Hi, Darrell. Mr. DARRELL WEST (Director, Taubman Center for Public Policy, Brown University): Good morning. How are you? STEWART: I'm doing well. For people who don't know a lot about Rhode Island, the history is, shall we say, colorful. Roger Williams broke off or he was banished from Plymouth because of his extreme views on supporting freedom of speech, assembly and religion. He insisted the land must be purchased from the Indians rather than just taken from them. And you say that sort of independent spirit is still alive in Rhode Island; that it is, quote, \"Small but feisty.\" How do you think that's going to translate at the polls next Tuesday? Mr. WEST: It's a state that often has produced surprising results. I mean, Rhode Island should be Clinton territory because it's a state that has a lot of women, senior citizens and working-class voters who are exactly the types of people in other states who have supported Hillary Clinton. But the Obama campaign has been outspending Hillary Clinton by 3-to-1 in Rhode Island in terms of advertising. So if there is any place where there might be a surprise, it could be Rhode Island. STEWART: Now, Rhode Island has a higher percentage of people with bachelor's degrees and a more than - a higher median income, household income, than the nation as a whole. Has that been reflected in the candidates that the voters have chosen in the past for national or even local office? Mr. WEST: Rhode Islanders tend to be pretty independent-minded. I mean, the reputation of the state is that it's a Democratic bastion. But half of the electorate actually identifies itself as independent. And we have open primaries so those independents can go either into the Democratic or Republican primaries. Given the fact that the GOP contest is pretty much settled, most of those independents are going to flood into the Democratic primary. And in other states, Obama has done better the larger the independent vote is in a particular state. STEWART: Now, Texas and Ohio, they have more than three times the number of delegates up for grabs in Rhode Island, yet Obama have been pouring money into ads in Rhode Island. Hillary Clinton has Bill and Chelsea stumping there. Why do you think Rhode Island is a strategic must for both of them? Mr. WEST: It's such a close race. I mean, Obama has about a 100-delegate lead over Clinton right now. But, you know, this is a race that could come down to individual delegates. Rhode Island just has 32 delegates. But in a very tight race, every delegate matters. And also on election night on March 4th, there are going to be four states balloting, and if Obama happens to lose Ohio and Texas, he still wants to be able to say that he won Vermont where he now is leading and if he can pull off an upset in Rhode Island then he can say he went two for four. STEWART: We're speaking to Darrell West. He's the director of the Taubman Center for Public Policy at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island. And I wonder if the case of Rhode Island senator, Republican Lincoln Chafee, who was not re-elected in 2006 - he lost to a Democrat - is that instructive for Tuesday's primary or general election? Mr. WEST: Chafee has come out and endorsed Obama as has Congressman Patrick Kennedy. Today, Ted Kennedy is coming to the state. But in general, those types of endorsements, I think, are overrated. I mean, we saw the prominent example of the Kennedys endorsing Obama in Massachusetts, but Hillary Clinton won that state by a double-digit margin. STEWART: Now, only 11 percent of the state electorate is registered Republican. Does that sound right? Mr. WEST: Yes. STEWART: Did the candidates, the GOP candidates, have they even been present there? Mr. WEST: In the last two weeks, we have had visits both from McCain and Huckabee, but the GOP campaign is low-key, no phone calls, no television ads. All of the intensity and all of the excitement is really on the Democratic side just because that race is still undecided. It's very close and people feel their vote actually matters. STEWART: But what about all these independents you told us about, almost half of the state electorate? Could they possibly decide, you know what, I'm liking McCain. Mr. WEST: They could. And there certainly will be some independents who will go into the GOP primary. But independents tend to go for the exciting race. And that clearly, in this state, is on the Democratic side just because there's been so much money spent there and there's been a lot of voter mobilization. We have students going door-to-door for various candidates. So this campaign is at a fever pitch. Rhode Island often has been an off-Broadway venue. It doesn't really attract a lot of attention. But right now, for the next five days, Rhode Island is in the middle of this national story. STEWART: We saw in Texas and - we saw in Texas and Ohio so much discussion about health care and about NAFTA. What is the big campaign issue in Rhode Island? Mr. WEST: The two big issues here still remain Iraq and the economy. I mean, there has been some attention to NAFTA and health care but not nearly to the extent that you've seen in Texas and Ohio. Ohio, in particular, is a state with a lot of manufacturing jobs. They've been hurt by this trading agreement so both candidates have made a major push on that issue. That issue, though, hasn't really attracted too much attention in New England. STEWART: Now, I know you worked in a poll of Rhode Island voters, likely Rhode Island voters, and it showed that Clinton was ahead of Obama - 36 percent to 28 percent - but you don't think that Hillary Clinton necessarily has a lock. Mr. WEST: I don't think it's a lock because we've done a survey three or four months ago that showed her with a 19 percentage point lead so her margin had dropped by half. And of course, Obama now has won 11 states in a row, has a lot of momentum. There's a lot of excitement in his campaign. He's outspending Hillary Clinton in Rhode Island. So she shouldn't assume she's necessarily going to win. I mean, this state still is very competitive. STEWART: And could be full of surprises. Why I love Rhode Island. Darrell West is the director of the Taubman Center for Public Policy at Brown University. Nice to speak with you. Mr. WEST: Thank you very much. RACHEL MARTIN, host: Hey, stay with us. Next on the BPP, our regular movie guide. Daniel Holloway. He's here with a round-up of what you should see this weekend at the movie theater. STEWART: And I drink your milkshake. How lines from movies become iconic? This is THE BRYANT PARK PROJECT from NPR News. I drink to that. MARTIN: I'm still trying to figure out if that's an insult or if that's like a positive thing? Am I supposed to be happy drinking my milkshake or am I supposed to be very upset? STEWART: I don't think you're supposed to be happy about that, Rachel. MARTIN: Okay. STEWART: Yeah.

Republican Catholics often cite abortion as the top issue, but for Catholics who are Democrats, other issues are more dominant. In the Democratic race so far between New York Sen. Hillary Clinton and Illinois Sen. Barack Obama, Clinton has been the choice among Catholics. She will need their support to carry the crucial states of Texas and Ohio for the March 4 primaries. In contests held through Super Tuesday, exit polls indicated that Clinton overwhelmingly won the Catholic vote. In delegate-rich states such as California, Massachusetts, New York and Connecticut, the Catholic vote went for Clinton by a margin of 2 to 1. She also racked up big margins in New Mexico and Arizona and won the demographic in every state except Missouri and Georgia. In the coming Ohio primary \u2014 seen as a must-win for Clinton \u2014 the Buckeye State's large population of older, white Catholics is a strategic focus. Both campaigns know it, but that does not make their jobs easy, according to the Pew Center's John Greene, who studies the intersection of religion and politics. \"There certainly is no Catholic bloc vote these days, like there may have been, say, in the 1960 election, when John F. Kennedy was running for election and the first Catholic was elected to the White House,\" Green says. It could be that Clinton has done well with Catholics because so many are blue collar, or because they are older \u2014 two categories of voters that Clinton has carried. But, Green also points out that exit polls from the Wisconsin primary on Feb. 19 indicate that the \"Catholic gap\" that Clinton has enjoyed could be evaporating. There is a possibility that Clinton and Obama could split the Catholic vote. At Jug's Bowling Center in a heavily Catholic, mostly working-class section of Toledo, Ohio, Wednesday nights are league nights. Bob Gehler, 58, is bowling with his wife, her sister and her brother-in-law, along with a friend. Gehler is one of the Catholic voters whom Clinton is counting on in Ohio. \"Hillary's groomed. She has more experience to get the things done,\" he says. But Gehler is still considering Obama, too. \"It's a toss-up. They're both good. I like them both, to tell you the truth,\" he says. Gehler says the fact that he is a practicing Catholic has no bearing on his vote on primary day. Maureen Samberg, 61, who is also at the bowling alley, agrees with Gehler. These are voters who say their top issues are jobs, health care and finding a way out of Iraq. The next day at Toledo's Regina Coeli Catholic Church, Father Jim Auth presides over the daily 8 a.m. Mass. The majority of the three-dozen worshippers are retirees, including Sue Szyskowski, a retired homemaker. \"I think Hillary is smarter,\" Szyskowzki says. \"She's very intelligent. I think Obama is going to change everything. That's all he says. He's going to change this; he's going to do this. That's not possible. And he's too young and inexperienced. So I'll vote for Hillary.\" But Frank Desposito, a retired business manager, is drawn to Obama as \"a new face.\" \"[Obama] probably has new ideas \u2014 maybe turning back the clock to 1960, to a J.F.K.-type of situation,\" Desposito says. \"Hillary, I can't see how anybody can say ... you know, change. She's 35 years in the business. What kind of change is she going to give you?\" None of these Catholic Democratic voters mention what is generally assumed to be the big issue for Catholics, which is abortion. Father Auth says the issue is important to these voters, but he says that they also look at what he calls broader life issues, such as the war, the death penalty and services for the poor. Even if Catholics are not the voting bloc they were in generations past, their vote will be watched closely in Ohio and elsewhere. What they do in the primaries will be a sign of their direction in November \u2014 especially in a big swing state like Ohio.",

Illinois Sen. Barack Obama won Wisconsin's Democratic primary on Tuesday, extending his winning streak over his rival for the party's presidential nomination, New York Sen. Hillary Clinton. Taken together with Hawaii, Obama now has 10  consecutive wins against Clinton, counting eight states, the District of Columbia and the Virgin Islands. Exit polls showed that Obama continued to make inroads into Clinton's base by splitting the vote among women, union households and households with less than $50,000 in annual income.  He also managed a modest majority among white voters. In his victory speech, Obama wasted no time before looking ahead to the next contests, to be held on March 4 in Texas, Ohio, Rhode Island and Vermont. Speaking from a Houston stage and holding a sample ballot, he told supporters that early voting in Texas had already begun and asked them to help him secure more delegates. \"Houston, I think we've achieved liftoff,\" he said about his Wisconsin win. On the Republican side, Arizona Sen. John McCain easily defeated former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee in Wisconsin's presidential primary. McCain's victory is likely to increase pressure on Huckabee to drop out of the race so that the Republican Party can unite behind a single candidate. Huckabee has said he will remain in the race until either he or McCain secures the necessary delegates to win the GOP nomination. That would appear all but certain to happen on March 4. In his victory speech Tuesday night, McCain focused on the general election campaign. \"I will fight every moment of every day in this campaign to make sure that Americans are not deceived by an eloquent but empty call for change,\" he said, referencing one of the central themes of the Obama campaign. In recent days, Obama \u2014 who is known for his inspirational speeches \u2014 has come under attack from both McCain and Clinton for the content of his speeches.  On Monday, the Clinton campaign accused him of \"plagiarism\" for borrowing some of his rhetoric from other speakers. Clinton did not deliver a concession speech at her campaign event in Youngstown, Ohio.  Instead, she highlighted her own strengths as a candidate while also taking a swipe at Obama. At a rally, she told supporters that a presidential primary \"is about picking a president who relies not just on words but on work \u2014 on hard work to get America back to work.\" Exit Polls: Economy as Key Issue for Voters In presidential contests across the U.S., the economy has emerged as a top concern for voters, and the Wisconsin electorate was no exception. Exit polls there showed trade was also a key issue for the many working-class Democrats who voted. Seven in 10 voters said international trade has caused job losses in Wisconsin, while fewer than one in five voters said it created more jobs than it has eliminated. Independents cast about one-quarter of the ballots in the Democratic race. Roughly 15 percent of the electorate said they were first-time voters. On the Republican side, McCain received stronger support among moderate Republicans than among independents, a group that he has won easily in other contests. His rival Huckabee received more support among those who called themselves very conservative. Wisconsin has long nurtured its tradition of an open primary, meaning voters could easily vote for candidates in either party.  The state does not register voters by party, and new voters can even register at the polls on the day of the contest. Democrats Look Toward March 4 With the Democratic race still tight, Wisconsin and its 74 Democratic delegates took on greater importance in the battle between Clinton and Obama. But the candidates could not focus all of their attention on Wisconsin\u2014 given the other upcoming primaries and the task of winning over the party's superdelegates, who act as free agents and who can vote for any candidate regardless of the popular vote in their states. During his campaign stops in Wisconsin, Obama talked mostly about the economy and tried to court the state's white, working-class voters. He visited a General Motors assembly plant in Janesville, Wis., telling the workers, \"We have greater income disparity in this country than we've seen since the first year of the Great Depression.\" Clinton's campaign has always kept its focus on the upcoming primaries in the delegate-rich states of Ohio and Texas. The evening of the Feb. 12 \"Potomac Primary\" \u2014 in which she lost contests in Maryland, Virginia and the District of Columbia to Obama \u2014 Clinton delivered her concession speech from El Paso, Texas, where she hoped to do well with the region's large number of Hispanic voters. Clinton also began running ads in working-class Ohio, featuring images of a waitress working late, in which she expressed her sympathy for those who must work the \"night shift.\" McCain Looks to November Election On the Republican side, McCain has an impressive delegate lead over Huckabee and is largely perceived as the party's inevitable nominee. His campaign rhetoric during the past week has reflected this presumptive status: He has focused his attacks on his potential Democratic opponents, with an eye toward the general election, rather than on Huckabee, his chief remaining Republican rival. McCain received two key endorsements recently.  On President Day, former President George H.W. Bush threw his support behind McCain and urged other Republicans to do the same. Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, who dropped out of the GOP presidential race earlier this month, asked his pledged delegates to vote for McCain. Still, McCain has yet to fully win over his fellow conservative Republicans, who tend to view him as a renegade for breaking party rank over issues such as immigration.

            "article_content": "Wisconsin is the next battleground  in the Democratic nomination contest. Senators Hillary Clinton and  Barack Obama both campaigned in the state Saturday.  LIANE HANSEN, host: From NPR News, this is WEEKEND EDITION. I'm Liane Hansen. Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton are waging a bitter battle in Wisconsin on this weekend before election day. Wisconsin voters go to the polls Tuesday. Obama hopes to extend his winning streak of eight straight primaries and caucuses since Super Tuesday. Clinton hopes to put the brakes on Obama's momentum. It's her last chance before big contests in Texas and Ohio on March 4th. Both candidates were in Milwaukee for a Democratic Party dinner last night, and NPR's Scott Horsley was there. SCOTT HORSLEY: Hillary Clinton's been running TV ads in Wisconsin complaining that Barack Obama won't debate her in the state. It wasn't exactly a debate last night, but in back-to-back speeches to a crowd of party activists. Clinton and Obama did outline sharply different visions of what the job of president requires. Clinton talked about a hairdresser she'd met earlier in the day at a town hall meeting in Kenosha. The woman was worried about losing her home to foreclosure because her adjustable mortgage payments had nearly doubled, even as her own business was on the decline. Senator HILLARY CLINTON (Democrat, New York, Presidential Candidate): I am reminded every single day why I do this. It's not about speeches for me, it's not about the bright lights and the cameras. It is about the changes we can make that actually deliver results in people's lives. HORSLEY: Both Clinton and Obama had been reaching out to the large number of working class voters in Wisconsin where nearly four in ten Democrats say the economy is their biggest concern. Clinton promised that American workers would have a champion in Washington if she's the party's nominee. Sen. CLINTON: Here in Milwaukee and in cities across America, janitors are cleaning up, waitresses are pouring coffee, police officers are standing guard, and they need a president who stands up for them. HORSLEY: Both Clinton and Obama delivered lengthy talks on the economy this past week, outlining plans to help working families pay for housing, health care and a college education. Obama said last night while they differ in some areas, they have a lot of ideas in common. Senator BARACK OBAMA (Democrat, Illinois, Presidential Candidate): Let's be clear, the problem we have is not the lack of good ideas. It's not the lack of good ideas. It's that Washington is the place where good ideas go to die. (Soundbite of laughter) HORSLEY: Obama blamed that on lobbyists and on politicians who he says spend more time scoring political points then bridging their differences. Sen. OBAMA: All too often it ends up being business as usual where we put forward all kinds of detailed plans and they get filed in drawers somewhere and the dust starts accumulating. Because nobody can inspire the country and build a working majority to actually deliver on the promises. HORSLEY: Clinton countered that she knows better than anyone how hard it would be to carry out the Democrats' proposals. She peppered her speech with the phrase \"get real,\" and said she has the necessary toughness to bring about real change in both foreign and domestic policy. Sen. CLINTON: It's going to take strength and experience, something that goes along with the job. Change is going to happen. The question is are we going to get the right kind of change? Because what I'm interested is not just change for the sake of change, but progress. HORSLEY: Clinton said it would take more than just speeches to achieve that. But Obama got the last word, and he defended the power of words to get Americans excited about what works in government. Sen. OBAMA: Don't tell me words don't matter. I have a dream, just words? We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, just words? We have nothing to fear but fear itself, just words? Just speeches? HORSLEY: Polls show Obama and Clinton in a close race in Wisconsin, and undecided voters could tip the balance. Senator Russ Feingold said last night he's grateful to the candidates for keeping it close so his home state of Wisconsin really matters. Scott Horsley, NPR News, Milwaukee.

Some say these men could become the \"soccer moms\" of this election cycle \u2014 the demographic that tips the balance. Whoever captures most of them is likely to be the Democratic nominee. But Wisconsin is a big state with a mix of urban and rural, factory and farm.  It is a state with many blue-collar voters: men who are wondering what global economic changes are going to mean for them and their families long-term. In downtown Milwaukee on a recent morning, one of these men is working as a parking attendant in a garage, a half block from where Illinois Sen. Barack Obama is speaking to thousands of supporters. Gary Kerfes, 55, is directing traffic in front of the parking ramp in 11 degree weather. He says he would rather be in attendance at Obama's rally. Kerfes says he is an undecided voter, torn between Obama and New York Sen. Hillary Clinton. His big issue is the economy, but he also worries about what comes next in Iraq. He says he once supported the war, but now he doesn't know what to think. As for Clinton and Obama, Kerfes says they are saying the same thing in different ways. \"I think either one of them would be very good,\" he says. \"I don't know if America is ready for a woman president or an African-American president, but there is going to be change.\" Kerfes says Obama's message of hope is appealing, but he says Clinton's more practical approach makes sense to him, as well. In the nearby working-class town of Kenosha, Don Stella has owned a barbershop called \"The Mensroom\" for 40 years. One client is Stella's longtime friend, Jim Ventura, who is a retired heavy-equipment operator. For Ventura, health insurance is the issue. \"They're losing it so rapidly, with all these businesses leaving and the middle class disappearing,\" he says. Ventura likes Obama, but Stella is leaning toward Clinton. Stella says he had his health care canceled by an insurance company 20 years ago, following heart bypass surgery. He says he appreciates all the work Clinton has done trying to provide affordable insurance, going back to her husband's presidency. Even before they started talking about the issues that matter most to them, Ventura says this election is very different than previous ones \u2014 from his perspective as a 70-year-old white male. \"It's been quite a change \u2014 the fact that we've had a woman and a black man running.  I had a hard time deciding which candidate I was going to vote for,\" he says. Four years ago in Wisconsin, Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry won the Democratic presidential primary. Former North Carolina Sen. John Edwards finished in second. This year, there is no white male contender on the Democratic side. Obama reached out to Edwards' supporters at a General Motors truck plant in Janesville, Wis. Clinton did the same at her own auto plant campaign stop in Ohio. In Janesville, Leo Sokolic is an official in the local electrical workers union. \"I'm still an Edwards guy.  I believe he's a good and honest person,\" he says. \"That's where I was, but he's not here.  The Democratic Party has got Obama and Hillary, and we've got to choose between them. And we've got to be unified behind them.\" Sokolic says he is leaning toward Obama, but he admits that it is not so easy for everyone he knows. \"I have a couple of very close personal friends, and one said, point blank yesterday, that 'I'll never vote for a black man or a woman to be president of the United States.' And we wrestled for that over a couple of hours in conversation.  He's still my friend.  I still love him to death.  I just don't agree with his decision.  But that's America, too.\" For Obama and Clinton, the outreach to working-class men will continue. Obama has secured an important endorsement from a big activist union, the Service Employees International Union. Clinton has shown strength among teachers and other government employee unions. In Wisconsin, the deciding battle is over the older unions \u2014 the ones whose members bent the metal and shaped Democratic politics since the 1930s.",

John McCain, after his chief rival, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, dropped out of the race. But the race's underdog, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, has gained strength as he receives support from conservative Republicans and evangelicals. Although he is far behind McCain in the number of delegates needed to secure the nomination, Huckabee won early voting victories in the Kansas caucuses and Louisiana primary. On the Democratic side, Sen. Barack Obama scored major victories over the weekend by winning all of the contests, including the Louisiana primary and caucuses in Maine, Washington and Nebraska. The demographics of Maine were supposed to favor Clinton, since white, poor voters have supported her.  Instead, Obama won the state with 59 percent to Clinton's 40 percent \u2014 although he has done much better in caucuses. Clinton also shook up her staff Sunday, replacing her longtime campaign manager with another aide. A Mason-Dixon poll released Sunday showed Obama leading Clinton 53 percent to 37 percent, and McCain beating Huckabee 55 percent to 27 percent in the so-called \"Potomac primaries.\" The poll was conducted on Feb. 7 and 8. Both Huckabee and Obama's recent victories make the Potomac primaries even more significant for both parties.  Here, an overview of what's at stake on Feb. 12, when Maryland, Virginia and Washington, D.C., hold presidential nominating contests: The Democrats Candidates: New York Sen. Hillary Clinton; Illinois Sen. Barack Obama. What's at Stake: In  a word, delegates. When Super Tuesday's voting contests essentially ended in a draw, both Clinton and Obama refocused their campaigns on the  states that followed \u2014 and the opportunities these contests offered to pick up delegates.  The name of the game is now reaching the magic number of 2,025 delegates. On Tuesday, Virginia will offer the greatest number (83), followed by Maryland (70) and Washington, D.C. (15). Both sides concede that Obama is likely to win Maryland and D.C., given the large percentage of African-Americans in both locales.  The nation's capital has the largest concentration of blacks in the country, with close to 55 percent. Maryland has the fifth largest, with 28.9 percent. A more competitive battle is likely to take place in Virginia. About one-fifth of Virginia's Democratic primary voters are African American, and the Northern Virginia suburbs include large numbers of high-income and highly educated voters. The state has no registration by party, so any voter can choose to vote in either primary. And with the more or less disappearance of a true Republican contest, many independents and Republicans might decide to vote in the Democratic primary, and thus, vote for Obama. Independents have preferred Obama over Clinton in this year's Democratic primaries and caucuses. In addition, Obama has received the endorsement of key local politicians, notably Gov. Tim Kaine and Rep. Robert Scott, the state's only black congressman. But as we've seen throughout the election season, the value of endorsements is limited. Recently, the Clinton campaign has made a play for Virginia's working-class voters and whites \u2014 groups who have tended to support her in recent voting. The Republicans Candidates: Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee; Arizona Sen. John McCain; Texas Rep. Ron Paul. What's at Stake: Although McCain has effectively been anointed the de facto Republican nominee, the Arizona senator still has a struggle to win over many conservatives in his party. That is especially true regarding his position on illegal immigration, which many on the right see as \"amnesty.\" When McCain mentioned the word immigration at a recent meeting of the Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington, D.C., attendees booed him. Huckabee, who has shown no indication of pulling out of the race any time soon, has been very popular with Southern Republican voters and evangelicals. (On Super Tuesday, Huckabee carried Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee, West Virginia and Arkansas. The following Saturday, he won the Louisiana primary and the caucuses in Kansas.) Huckabee could benefit from any Republican opposition to McCain in Tuesday's primary. Issues: As it has been throughout the primary season, the economy is a top issue here. The Iraq war, health   care, terrorism and immigration also consistently have been important.",

            "article_content": "Even as Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois and Sen. Hillary Clinton of New York bring diversity to presidential politics, voters are lining up in well-defined racial and ethnic groups.  RENEE MONTAGNE, host: Some analysis now from NPR's Juan Williams, who joins us on the line. Good morning, Juan. JUAN WILLIAMS: Good morning, Renee. MONTAGNE: Now, we've just heard a range of views among Democratic voters in Maryland. How are these different views playing out among different constituencies? You have some numbers there. WILLIAMS: Well, you know, it's interesting, because there's a real racial divide becoming apparent that's been apparent for some time now, but becoming sharper. For example, over the weekend in Louisiana, blacks made up half of the electorate in Louisiana, and as you know, Senator Obama won the contest 57 percent to 36 percent for Senator Clinton. But among the African-Americans who voted in Louisiana - as I said, half of those Democratic votes - Senator Barack Obama got 86 percent of their votes. Among the remaining Louisiana voters, mostly white, Senator Clinton won about 60 percent. And as I say, that fits with what's been happening in recent contests, particularly in the southern states. If you remember, Renee, in South Carolina, Senator Obama got 80 percent of the black vote. He reached similar highs in Alabama and Georgia. Meanwhile, in several contests Senator Clinton has been winning more than 50 percent of white men. That's been going down a little bit recently. And close to 70 percent of white women. MONTAGNE: In an NPR interview over the weekend, Senator Obama was asked if he's concerned that voters are split along racial lines, and particularly between black and white. Let's listen to a bit of his response. Senator BARACK OBAMA (Democrat, Illinois, Presidential Candidate): You know, I think that's a very hard argument to make. There are not a lot of African-Americans in Nebraska the last time I checked, or in Utah, or in Idaho, areas where I probably won some of my biggest margins. So you know, I know the press has been obsessed with the racial divide, but you know, that's just not how it's playing out across the country. MONTAGNE: Well, maybe not across the country, but Juan, has it not played out already that way in some states, as you've just suggested? WILLIAMS: I think so, and I think, Renee, what you're hearing there is Senator Obama seeking to have it both ways. His campaign, as you know, made a concerted effort to win over black voters, and now he has them as the really - his leverage point in this contest. He can count on them as he can count on no other constituency. But at the same time he doesn't want to be defined as the black candidate in the race, realizing the possibility that white voters would be turned off to that. He wants to be someone who transcends race. But if you look, for example, at Latinos, if you look at Asians, you see this racial divide. It's not just black and white. For example, in California, Senator Clinton won 66 percent of the Latino vote, doubling Senator Obama's total, Renee. In New York she won Latinos with 74 percent of their vote; in New Mexico 56 percent of the Latino vote. Among Asians in California she won a whopping 73 percent of their vote. So this is consistent. It's not just black and white. What you have is Senator Obama winning the black vote, that being his base, and Senator Clinton then going towards the white vote, the Latino vote and the Asian vote. MONTAGNE: Although just briefly, there's studies showing that when Hispanics become familiar with Obama, they do regard him favorably. So this isn't all fixed in stone when you talk about the Latino, the Hispanic vote. WILLIAMS: No, but it's overwhelming, I think, you know, for Senator Obama to - the contest right from the start, even with black voters, was about him gaining name identification, people becoming familiar, people becoming excited about his candidacy. He had to persuade black voters, for example, that he could win white votes in order for them to take him seriously as a candidate, and that's what he's done. MONTAGNE: And Juan, what about Wisconsin and Ohio? Those are crucial big states coming up in the next few weeks. WILLIAMS: Well, what you can see, Renee, is that given the kind of divide that we've seen - and they're pretty much now a clear demarcation between the two, Senator Clinton holding on to white women, older voters, working class voters, as well as poor voters, so long as they're white; and Senator Obama winning black voters, as we've been talking about, upper income voters, highly educated voters, and especially young voters. So looking forward, going into Wisconsin, Ohio, and even Washington, D.C., Virginia and Maryland this week, he can count on that constituency as a base, and the question is whether or not he can expand it. MONTAGNE: Juan, thanks very much. WILLIAMS: You're welcome, Renee. MONTAGNE: NPR News analyst Juan Williams.

            "article_content": "The winner of the Iowa caucuses just one month ago, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee is now the clear underdog in the race for the Republican presidential nomination. He has spent much of the past week campaigning across the South, where he hopes the Evangelical base can give him a lift.  MICHELE NORRIS, Host: A quarter of the delegates at stake tomorrow on Super Tuesday are the south. Former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee hasn't won a Republican contest since Iowa, and he's been focusing on those southern states. NPR's Robert Smith reports from Chattanooga, Tennessee. ROBERT SMITH: A long-shot presidential candidate goes to five emotional stages on the eve of an election. In Chattanooga, Mike Huckabee began the day with denial, at least of the national polls that show him running behind. MIKE HUCKABEE: I think people ought to make up their own minds. If they think I represent their views, then vote for me and I'll be the winner. SMITH: It was followed by anger. HUCKABEE: I know Mr. Romney's been trying to do a little voter suppression by telling people that a vote for me is really a vote for John McCain. Let me tell you something. A vote for me is exactly what it is. It is a vote for me. And here's why I want you to help us. SMITH: There is the third stage of being a long-shot candidate - bargaining with your supporters to get the vote. HUCKABEE: Get on the phone. Go knock on their doors and find out. Are they going to vote for Mike Huckabee? If they say yes, you get them to the polls. If they say no, I'm not going to vote for him, don't let them go vote tomorrow. (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER) SMITH: But the underdog has to be realistic. So after pumping up the crowd at the Chattanooga convention Center, Huckabee moved on to the fourth stage - depression of expectations. He told reporters that there isn't a set number of delegates that he needs to win tomorrow. HUCKABEE: The main thing we have to do is to keep somebody from getting 1191 tomorrow. If we do that, you know, there's still a game going on. SMITH: The fifth emotional stage is acceptance, and Huckabee's already comfortable to where he stands on the eve of Super Tuesday. HUCKABEE: I don't know what it's like to be anything but the underdog. Maybe once in my life I'd like to start from the top, just to see how it feels. But I've never been there. SMITH: Now, these stages aren't necessarily negative. Huckabee used that underdog charm to win the Iowa caucuses. But since then, the campaign hasn't been able to replicate it. Huckabee's hoping a strong core of evangelical voters in the south may help revive the campaign. And just in case, he's also courting the good-old-boy vote in places like Macon, Georgia. (SOUNDBITE OF APPLAUSE) HUCKABEE: Let's get it done. (SOUNDBITE OF CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) SMITH: In trying to broaden his working class appeal by promising to shutdown the IRF. HUCKABEE: This is what you can do with your 1040. (SOUNDBITE OF CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) SMITH: The folks that show up at Huckabee events are so dedicated to the man that many of them have no second choice candidate. But others are coming to that stage of acceptance. Andrew Hoffman(ph) from Chattanooga hopes that voting for Huckabee will send the message even if he doesn't win. ANDREW HOFFMAN: We wanted to make sure that the Republican nominee has heard the voices of the Wal-Mart Republicans as Mike Huckabee said today. If John McCain can pay attention to that voice and give it a place in his campaign, that will be the second best possible outcome of the Mike Huckabee campaign. SMITH: The best possible outcome? Well, that would be the rare sixth emotional stage of being an underdog - victory. Robert Smith, NPR News, Chattanooga. Copyright \u00a9 2008 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "The economy took center stage as Republican presidential candidates held a debate Thursday in Boca Raton, Fla. They supported the Bush-Congress deal to stimulate the economy, but pressed for deeper tax cuts.  STEVE INSKEEP, Host: As NPR's Scott Horsley reports, this week's news guaranteed there would be just one leading topic. SCOTT HORSLEY: Former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney seized the opportunity to tout his credentials as a successful business consultant and private equity investor. M: I spent my life in the private sector. I know how jobs come and I know how they go, and I'll make sure that we create more good jobs for this nation. And one way to do that is by holding down taxes and making those tax cuts permanent. HORSLEY: Romney's campaign has been busy pointing out press clippings, in which his chief rival, Arizona Senator John McCain, confesses a limited background in economics. But McCain showed no such modesty during last night's debate. INSKEEP: And I have been a consistent fighter to restrain spending and to cut taxes. And my credentials and my experience and my knowledge of these economic issues I think are extensive and I would match them against anybody who's running. HORSLEY: Former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee expressed some reservations about the stimulus plan, which will send $600 tax rebate checks to most working Americans. He says the government might be better off building new highways to help traffic-weary Floridians and keep the money at home. M: One of the concerns that I have is that we'll probably end up borrowing this $150 billion from the Chinese. And when we get those rebate checks, most people are going to go out and buy stuff that's been imported from China. I have to wonder whose economy is going to be stimulated the most by the package. HORSLEY: Huckabee also reminded his rivals that a few months ago he was the only Republican sounding the alarm about the economic challenges facing working class voters. M: And if you pay attention to the people who are the single moms and the working people who barely get from paycheck to paycheck, you'd find out months in advance that this economy was headed for a downward turn. HORSLEY: Candidates also fielded questions on issues of special concern to Floridians, including a catastrophic insurance pool to help homeowners in hurricane prone areas. Romney said he'd back some kind of cooperative effort among high-risk states. McCain, however, was wary of too large a federal role. INSKEEP: I'm confident we can do it together working with the insurance companies, not setting up another huge federal bureaucracy of $200 billion, which still nobody has said how you're going to pay for. HORSLEY: Most recent polls show McCain holding a slight lead among Republicans in Florida, with Romney close behind. McCain has been forced to spend time away from Florida, raising money though, while Romney can partially fund his campaign from his own pocket. The multimillionaire refused to say last night how much of his own money he has put in. M: One thing's real clear. Given the contribution I made in this race, I know I owe no one anything. I don't have some group there that I have a special obligation to that raised money for me. HORSLEY: One-time front-runner Rudy Giuliani, meanwhile, has slipped in the polls to third or even fourth place. The former New York mayor insists his unconventional strategy of largely sitting out the earlier contests will pay off in Florida. M: I believe that I'm going to have the same fate that the New York Giants had last week... (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER) M: ...and we're going to come from behind and surprise everyone. We have them all lulled into a very false sense of security now. HORSLEY: Scott Horsley, NPR News, Boca Raton, Florida. Copyright \u00a9 2008 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "At Stake in Nevada Record turnout is expected for Saturday's Democratic caucuses in Nevada, where candidates are hoping to show their clout in the party's first western nominating contest and the first state contest with a significant minority population. Four years ago, fewer than 10,000 Democrats showed up \u2014 about 2 percent of those who were eligible. So this year, Democrats Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and John Edwards know they are vying for a lot of first-time caucus-goers. Political scientist David Damore of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, said coming after those votes in Nevada is not easy because the state does not have a tradition of intense political involvement. \"It's a transient place,\" Damore said. \"The iconic places in Las Vegas are full of a bunch of tourists. You're not going to spend your time there.\" He said Democratic politicians have developed a formula: visit a union hall, walk through a neighborhood and hold a rally in a high school gym. Desert Pines High School was the setting for Clinton's rally on Tuesday in a working-class neighborhood of Las Vegas. \"There are still a lot of people in the state who aren't quite sure what the caucus is,\" she told the crowd. \"So, you've got to get out and talk to as many people as possible: your friends, your family, your neighbors. And come to those caucuses on Saturday morning.\" Candidates have also been busy courting organized labor, which plays a larger role in Nevada than in either of the two previous contests in Iowa and New Hampshire. The state's biggest union, representing casino employees, has already endorsed Obama, triggering a court-fight over casino caucus sites. But there is no guarantee rank-and-file members will go along with that recommendation. Carla Jackson, a maid at the MGM Grand casino, is a precinct captain for Clinton. \"She won my support every day,\" Jackson said. \"Ever since Bill [Clinton] was in there, I had them on my side.\" Obama, meanwhile, is attracting some of the same kind of crossover support that helped him win in Iowa. Greg Wood showed up at an Obama town hall meeting in the town of Henderson. \"I thought it was very good. I'm a Republican and I came in thinking I needed to vote for John McCain but I think I've changed my mind,\" he said. Former North Carolina Sen. Edwards also hopes to make a strong showing in Nevada, where one newspaper poll shows a tight, three-way race. Edwards stuck to another part of Damore's formula on Wednesday night, speaking at the headquarters of the carpenters' union in Las Vegas. \"I am so proud to be in this union hall and to stand with the men and women of organized labor who helped build the middle class in this country and who are going to help reestablish the middle class in America when I'm president of the United States,\" he said to cheers. Nevada's caucuses will also be an early test of Latino voting power, in a state that's one-quarter Hispanic. Latino leader Ruben Kihuen, a member of the state Legislature, was heavily courted by all the Democrats. He ultimately endorsed Clinton but said the close contest with Obama and Edwards has been healthy. \"Regardless of who ends up getting the nomination, this is all good for the party,\" he said. \"There are people being energized who have never been energized before.\" There are now slightly more Democrats registered to vote in Nevada than there are Republicans.  The party hopes that will turn this Republican red state to the Democratic blue column in November.",

            "article_content": "Democrats made gains in the House and Senate for the second straight election, knocking off some prominent Republican incumbents and winning open seats that had been held by the GOP. But they came up short of the 60 Senate seats needed to end filibusters.  ROBERT SIEGEL, host: And while Obama was sweeping to victory yesterday, so too were congressional Democrats. As we mentioned earlier in the hour, they did well, but they didn't pull off the landslide that some had predicted. And there are some races that remain too close to call. NPR's Brian Naylor has this rundown of what happened in the congressional contests. BRIAN NAYLOR: After returning to the majority two years ago, congressional Democrats yesterday were able to add to their numbers. House Democrats will start next January with a gain of at least 19 seats. Several races remain undecided, and that number could go up. Democrats prevailed from Connecticut, where 11-term incumbent Chris Shays was beaten, leaving no Republican House member from New England, to Idaho, where first-term incumbent Bill Sally was ousted. Despite their larger majority, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said today, Democrats will govern as centrists. Speaker of the House NANCY PELOSI (Democrat, California): The country must be governed from the middle. The country must be governed from the middle. You have to bring people together to reach consensus on solutions that are sustainable and acceptable to the American people. NAYLOR: Centrism and bipartisanship was a mantra for Democrats across the country yesterday. Democratic Senate candidates picked up seats in every region, winning open seats held by Republicans and knocking off GOP incumbents. Democrat Kay Hagan ousted first-term incumbent Elizabeth Dole in North Carolina. Senator-elect KAY HAGAN (Democrat, North Carolina): And to the North Carolinians who didn't vote for me, I am going to be working hard for the next six years to earn your vote. (Soundbite of applause) Sen.-elect HAGAN: Because Democrats, Republicans, or independent, the ideas we need to create good-paying jobs and turn our economy around won't have a party label. NAYLOR: In Virginia, former Governor Mark Warner, elected to the seat being vacated by Republican John Warner, sounded a similar theme. Senator-elect MARK WARNER (Democrat, Virginia): A lot of you heard me say this before, but the challenges we face are much more about the future versus the past. And as long as we face that future and avoid the political divisions of the past, there is nothing we can't accomplish as Americans first and foremost. NAYLOR: Elsewhere in the South, Democratic challenger Jim Martin came up short in his bid to oust Republican incumbent Saxby Chambliss, but he held Chambliss to under 50 percent, necessitating a December runoff under that state's election laws. In another high-profile contest, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell held on to his Kentucky seat, despite Democratic efforts. In the West, cousins Mark and Tom Udall were elected to open Senate seats from Colorado and New Mexico respectively. Tom Udall said it's about jobs. Senator-elect TOM UDALL (Democrat, New Mexico): And the first task we have to undertake in this country is rebuilding our economy, putting all of our policies at the federal level, taxes, economic, trade, behind middle-class people, no more shipping jobs overseas, growing jobs here in America, in New Mexico. NAYLOR: A number of key Senate races remain too close to call today. In Minnesota, Republican incumbent Norm Coleman holds a slender 571-vote lead over Democrat Al Franken, and there will be a recount. In Oregon, Republican incumbent Gordon Smith leads challenger Jeff Merkley, but many votes remain to be counted. And in Alaska, Republican Ted Stevens, despite being convicted of seven felonies, leads Democrat Mark Begich with several thousand absentee ballots to be counted. As it stands, Democrats will have at least 56 seats in the new Senate. Brian Naylor, NPR News, the Capitol. Copyright \u00a9 2008 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "Barack Obama's path from underdog candidate to president-elect is among the most unlikely success stories in the history of American politics. The outcome is a tribute to his skills as an orator, an organizer and a politician.  But none of it would have happened without a well-organized, well-funded and well-disciplined organization that always seemed to know how to respond to crises. That's because a campaign is not a static thing. It's a process \u2014 and an unpredictable one at that. Things don't go as planned. So the real trick is to adapt. War, Then Wall Street Way back when, Obama was an underdog taking on front-runner Hillary Clinton. It looked like his big issue would be the war. \"Most of you know that I opposed this war from the start. I thought it was a tragic mistake,\" Obama said in February 2007 during the very first speech of his campaign. Discontent over the war did help propel Obama's early success in the Iowa caucuses and later on Super Tuesday. But during the general election, the war actually receded as an issue, replaced by a sudden jolt of dire news from Wall Street. \"We are in the middle of the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression,\" Obama said. Just before the economic crisis, the Obama campaign seemed to be slumping.  His long-standing lead in the polls had evaporated.  His supporters openly worried that potential victory might be slipping away. In September, Obama called an urgent meeting of his advisers to talk about the need to refocus. Then came the failure of the giant investment bank Lehman Brothers. Obama had long talked of the need to help American workers and the middle class. And then the economy became the centerpiece of his campaign. He blamed the policies of President Bush and his Republican rival, John McCain. \"They said they wanted to let the market run free, but instead they let it run wild,\" Obama said. Fundamental Flub Obama prepared to go hard after McCain on the economy to highlight McCain's own past statements about not being an expert on the issue.  But then McCain gave them fresh ammunition when he flubbed in reacting to the crisis on Wall Street. \"The fundamentals of our economy are strong,\" McCain said. Later in the day, McCain said the fundamentals were at risk. \"This morning, he said that the fundamentals of the economy are still strong,\" Obama said. \"Sen. McCain, what economy are you talking about?\" Then McCain suspended his campaign and called on Obama to do the same. It was a moment of decision for the Democrat. He chose to keep campaigning and to keep pressing his attacks on the issue. \"It is going to be part of the president's job to deal with more than one thing at once,\" Obama said. Exit polls show that the economy was by far the most significant issue for voters on Tuesday. That gave Obama a big edge.  He can credit his message, but also the huge organizational and financial advantages he used to keep McCain on the defensive the rest of the way. The Wright Test Over the course of the long campaign, there were other big tests Obama needed to overcome just to make it to the general election.  Perhaps the biggest challenge was the emergence of a voice from Chicago's South Side. In March, video footage surfaced of Obama's former pastor, the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, saying \"not God bless America. God damn America.\" Suddenly, race became the issue of the campaign. Obama responded with a lengthy speech on race in America.  His remarks were widely praised and very personal. \"Rev. Wright's comments were not only wrong, but divisive \u2014 divisive at a time when we need unity, racially charged at a time when we need to come together to solve a set of monumental problems,\" Obama said. Finally, another key part of Obama's success has been the securing of prominent endorsements along the way.  Sen. Edward Kennedy and President Kennedy's daughter, Caroline Kennedy, helped make the case to traditional Democrats.  And very late in the campaign came the backing of an iconic military figure, former Secretary of State Gen. Colin Powell. \"I think he is a transformational figure. He is a new generation coming in to the world stage, onto the American stage, and for that reason I'll be voting for Sen. Barack Obama,\" Powell said. It was one more piece of reassurance for anyone still wondering about Obama's readiness. And it provided an unexpected boost that complemented all of the planning, the organizing and the adapting that the president-elect's team did along the way.",

            "article_content": "Republican presidential hopeful John McCain is trying to keep red states voting Republican. McCain will be looking for votes in seven swing states Monday before he returns to his home state of Arizona.  SCOTT HORSLEY: And I'm Scott Horsley with the McCain campaign. After John McCain's presidential hopes almost collapsed in 2007, he traveled to New Hampshire to pick up the pieces. He eventually won the New Hampshire primary after holding more than a hundred town hall meetings there. Last night, with his campaign again facing long odds, McCain returned to the Granite State for one more town hall. (Soundbite of Republican town hall meeting, New Hampshire) Senator JOHN MCCAIN (Republican, Arizona; Republican Presidential Candidate): In the tradition of New Hampshire, I'd like to take a few minutes and respond to any questions or comments or insults that you may have for me. Thank you very much for coming tonight. HORSLEY: It was vintage McCain, answering questions about immigration, for example, or global warming with his signature frankness. Senior adviser Mark Salter says New Hampshire has long held a special place in McCain's heart. Mr. MARK SALTER (Senior Aide, McCain Campaign): As far as, you know, the presidential campaign part of his career began, it began in 1999 at the Peterborough Town Hall with - we had to give out free ice cream, and I think we had about 13 people show up. HORSLEY: There were a lot more than that cheering McCain on his return to Peterborough last night. (Soundbite of crowd chanting \"John McCain\") HORSLEY: Salter insists this visit isn't just about nostalgia. Mr. SALTER: Oh, no, no, no. We think it's a competitive state. We think a lot of these battleground states are within the margin of error. We're up in a couple. You know, we work real hard. Move some of these; we'll catch up to him by Tuesday. (Soundbite of Republican campaign rally, Scranton, Pennsylvania) Unidentified Man: Well, good afternoon, northeast Pennsylvania. (Soundbite of crowd cheering) HORSLEY: Pennsylvania is the blue state McCain has been working hardest to move over into the Republican column. He campaigned yesterday in Scranton alongside former Pennsylvania Governor Tom Ridge. (Soundbite of Republican campaign rally, Scranton, Pennsylvania) Mr. TOM RIDGE (Republican Politician; Former Governor of Pennsylvania): Well, we got some work to do. We got two days and a wake up. Take all this enthusiasm and grab a couple of friends and drag them to the polls as well. HORLSEY: The McCain campaign is working to mobilize conservative voters in western and central Pennsylvania in hopes of offsetting Barack Obama's advantage in the city of Philadelphia. Kansas Senator Sam Brownback tagged along to help drum up support from anti-abortion voters. McCain held another rally in the suburbs of Philadelphia where he stressed his record against taxes and government spending. (Soundbite of Republican campaign rally, Philadelphia) Senator MCCAIN: I have a plan to hold the line on taxes and cut them to make America more competitive and create jobs here at home. HORSLEY: McCain's rhetoric has not changed in the last couple of weeks, but his advisers say they see the race tightening as the campaign shakes off the effects of the financial crisis which coincided with significant gains for Obama. Polls still show McCain trailing in most major battlegrounds, albeit by shrinking margins. He told supporters in Scranton yesterday things are moving his way. (Soundbite of Republican campaign rally, Scranton, Pennsylvania) Senator MCCAIN: I can sense the enthusiasm and the momentum in these last 48 hours. We're going to win this race, my friends. We're going to win it. (Soundbite of crowd ovation) Senator MCCAIN: We're going to win it. HORSLEY: McCain wrapped up the last weekend of the campaign with a midnight rally in Florida. That left time for just a few hours sleep before today's seven-state dash to his home in Arizona. Scott Horsley, NPR News, Miami. Copyright \u00a9 2008 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "Election Day is Tuesday. Over the weekend, Democrat Barack Obama kept up a frenetic pace to motivate voters to go to the polls. Obama is concentrating on states that previously voted for President Bush.  STEVE INSKEEP, host: It's Morning Edition from NPR News. Good morning, I'm Steve Inskeep. RENEE MONTAGNE, host: And I'm Renee Montagne. Here's a truism of politics. Whatever the polls may say, it doesn't mean anything if your supporters don't vote. And on this final day before the election, Barack Obama and John McCain are hoping to win the contest on turnout. INSKEEP: Obama is focusing on states that voted twice for President Bush, states that he hopes to capture in 2008. John McCain is working to hold on to as many of those states as he can and also come from behind in the big state of Pennsylvania. MONTAGNE: Day after day this fall, we've been hearing campaign updates from NPR's Scott Horsley and Don Gonyea. You can listen now to two men who know the end is near. DON GONYEA: For Barack Obama Sunday, it was three major Ohio cities. First came Columbus where the crowd filled the State Capitol grounds and spilled down the block. In Ohio, the big issue is the economy. (Soundbite of Democratic campaign rally, Columbus, Ohio) Senator BARACK OBAMA (Democrat, Illinois; Democratic Presidential Candidate): In two days, you can choose policies that invest in our middle class and create new jobs, grow this economy so that everybody has a chance to succeed, from the CEO to the secretary and the janitor, from the factory owner to the men and women who work on the factory floor. In two days. GONYEA: Ohio has lost 213,000 jobs in the past eight years. Obama tailored his stump speech here to talk about the need to fix trade deals that he says are too often unfair to American workers. All weekend Obama also made sure everyone knew about comments by Vice President Dick Cheney Saturday at a Wyoming fundraiser. Cheney said that John McCain is the best choice for president. (Soundbite of Democratic campaign rally, Columbus, Ohio) Senator OBAMA: Cheney knows what you know, that with John McCain you get a twofer: George Bush's economic policies and Dick Cheney's foreign policy. But you know what? That's a risk we can't afford to take. GONYEA: From Columbus, it was off to Cleveland where a special guest warmed up an even larger crowd gathered downtown at dusk. (Soundbite of song \"The Rising\") Mr. BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN: (Singing) Come on up for the rising. Come on up, lay your hands in mine. GONYEA: Bruce Springsteen told the audience that over his entire career, he's tried to explore the stories of working people and those struggling to make their way. He spoke of the distance that exists between the American dream and the American reality. (Soundbite of Democratic campaign rally, Cleveland, Ohio) Mr. BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN (Singer-Songwriter): I believe that Senator Obama has taken the measure of that distance in his own life and in his own word. And I believe that he understands in his heart the cost of that distance in blood and in suffering in the lives of everyday Americans. I believe as president he will work to bring that promise back to life. GONYEA: Springsteen then introduced Obama who took the stage with his wife, Michelle, and daughters Malia and Sasha. The candidate in his speech again focused on jobs, but also on Iraq, promising to end the war. And he spoke of the need to turn the page on the Bush administration. Then, 12 minutes into Obama's speech, the skies opened up and the heavy rain began to fall. (Soundbite of Democratic campaign rally, Cleveland, Ohio) Senator OBAMA: No, that's all right. We've been through an eight-year storm, but a new day is dawning. Sunshine is on the way. We've just got two more days of these clouds. GONYEA: Obama wrapped up the day with a late rally on the football field at the University of Cincinnati. He again urged people to go vote and make phone calls and knock on doors to drive a huge turnout. Campaign officials seem relaxed and confident. They are expecting good news tomorrow night.

            "article_content": "U.S. Sen. Saxby Chambliss and the Georgia GOP are battling not only a strong Democratic challenger, but also the vast voter-registration drive of the Obama campaign. Libertarian candidate Allen Buckley is taking some votes away from Chambliss and could force a runoff election if no one gets a majority of the vote.  ROBERT SIEGEL, host: Now, another Republican senator in trouble, in Georgia earlier this year, the re-election of Republican Saxby Chambliss seemed to be a sure thing. But as the economy has faltered the race has tightened. Chambliss is facing Democrat Jim Martin, a former state representative, and national Democrats have been providing Martin with lots of attention and millions of dollars. From Atlanta, NPR's Kathy Lohr reports. KATHY LOHR: Republican incumbent Senator Saxby Chambliss was way ahead in the polls until the last few weeks, when his double digit lead evaporated. According to some voters, challenger Jim Martin has the edge for one main reason. Ms. REPONSEL MORRIS (Real State Agent): The economy. We got to get the economy moving. People have to have jobs. People have to feel secure. LOHR: Repunsel Morris is a real state agent in Atlanta, and exactly the kind of voter Jim Martin is trying to reach. At rallies across the state this week including one in Lawrence Ville, the Democrats stressed his opposition to the Wall Street Bailout package, a plan has opponent voted for. Mr. JIM MARTIN (Democrat, 2008 Senatorial Candidate,. Atlanta): Well, we got disaster.  And $700 billion of our money, of our children's money and our grand children's money is at stake, and that's just not right. (Soundbite of applause) LOHR: Like Barack Obama, Martin promises to look out for the middle class. Mr. MARTIN: And they see, nobody doing that in Washington. They certainly don't see Saxby Chambliss doing that. They see him as somebody who is basically been a rubber stamp for President Bush in his economic policies and they want that change. LOHR: Another factor for Democrats, retribution. Many are still angry about the Senate campaign in Georgia six years ago against Max Cleland, a Vietnam veteran and triple amputee. Chambliss ran ads that attacked Cleland as unpatriotic and soft on national security. So, this year, the National Democrats have poured nearly $3 million into Georgia to pay for their own TV ads. (Soundbite of political ad) Unidentified Man: Once Saxby Chambliss is been up to win Washington supporting George Bush's economic policies every step of the way. They gave us higher food prices, a $10 trillion national debt and the $700 billion Wall Street Bailout. LOHR:  Chambliss is fighting back. Senator SAXBY CHAMBLISS (Republican, Georgia): Thank you. Unidentified Man #2: Good luck, sir. Senator CHAMBLISS: Hi there.  How you all there? I'm glad to see you buddy. Unidentified Man #3: Thank you. Good to see you. LOHR: At the campaign stop in Conyers, Georgia this week, Chambliss talked about the economic crisis, but also focused on the need for off shore drilling and the continued threat of terrorism. He told folks this year one of their most important jobs is to get out to vote. Sen. CHAMBLISS: As you go around and talk to your friends, your colleagues you work with, you go to church with, you drink coffee with. Please tell them that we need them to vote for John McCain and for Saxby Chambliss. If by chance they are drinking something different that day and say they're not going to vote for John and me, tell him the election is November the eighth. LOHR: Chambliss acknowledges the economic crisis will helped democrats, making this race even more important. Sen. CHAMBLISS: The Democrats realize they're going to pick up seats and we're doing everything we can obviously to win. But for all the right reasons, one of the those reasons is that its imperative that we keep enough Senate seats in Republicans hands to make sure that we could stop bad legislation or help shape bad legislation into better legislation. LOHR: As for the negative tone of the campaign, Chambliss blames his opponent. But the national Republicans have spent $1.4 million on their own attack ads. (Soundbite of political ad) Unidentified Man #3: Our economy is in crisis. Georgia families are losing their homes, their savings, their retirements, and while Jim Martin talks about the middle class. He voted to hit Georgia families with the largest tax increase in state history. LOHR: All this ads have helped to make the race even more competitive. Political scientist at Emory University, Merrill Black, says the large number of newly registered black voters here will help the Democrat. Mr. MERRILL BLACK (Political Scientist, Emory University): We're going to see the largest turn out among African-American voters in the history of Georgia. Maybe 30 percent or more of registered voters may be African Americans. By the time we get these final numbers, I think that's going to produce a straight ticket, a Democratic vote that's comes down to Jim Martin. LOHR: There's also a Libertarian candidate in the race, Allen Buckley. He's not well-known but may provide another twist. If no candidate gets a majority of the vote, the race would go to a run off in December. And that would make Georgia, the focal point of both parties. Kathy Lohr, NPR News Atlanta.

            "article_content": "Republican presidential candidate John McCain has told supporters in Ohio that his Democratic rival, Barack Obama, will raise taxes on the middle class. With five days left for the presidential election, McCain is touring swing states.  MICHELE NORRIS, host: From NPR News, this is All Things Considered. I'm Michele Norris. ROBERT SIEGEL, host: And I'm Robert Siegel. We begin this hour on the campaign trail with the day's battleground state duels over taxes, socialism and whose policies will most help Joe the Plumber. First, John McCain is back on the Straight Talk Express. He spent the day traveling through Ohio. And NPR's Scott Horsley was with him. SCOTT HORSLEY: John McCain is in the midst of a two-day bus tour through Ohio. His first stop today, a town called Defiance. (Soundbite of Republican campaign rally, Defiance, Ohio) Senator JOHN MCCAIN (Republican, Arizona; Republican Presidential Candidate): We're a few points down, but we're coming back. HORSLEY: Polls do show McCain trailing in Ohio, but an enthusiastic crowd greeted the candidate on a chilly morning. Retired corn farmer Dick Martin drove in from nearby Fayette, Ohio. He thinks McCain has the right stuff. Mr. DICK MARTIN (Retired Corn Farmer): Well, he's been around a long time. He served his country very well for a long time. And I think he has the experience that I want to see in a man in there in office. HORSLEY: Martin thinks McCain's background will be useful not only for tackling foreign crises, but also for dealing with the nation's struggling economy. Mr. MARTIN: This economic thing kind of snuck up on most of us. It certainly did me. I had no idea that our world was this fragile in an economic way. HORSLEY: The economic turmoil of recent weeks snuck up on McCain, as well, and put the Republican at a disadvantage since more Americans say they trust Obama to deal with economic issues. In Florida yesterday, McCain briefly tried to change the subject. He held a roundtable on national security threats. Security may have taken a backseat to pocketbook issues, he said, but that's only temporary. (Soundbite of Republican national security roundtable, Tampa, Florida) Senator MCCAIN: These dangers have not gone away while we turned our attention elsewhere. And the next president will meet no greater test than defending America from these threats. HORSLEY: Turning back to the economy, in Ohio today McCain warned that Obama would raise taxes on the middle class. Obama's promised not to raise taxes on families making less than a quarter million dollars a year. But McCain's been challenging that pledge ever since Ohio plumber Joe Wurzelbacher, who makes far less, questioned Obama about his tax plan. (Soundbite of Republican campaign rally, Defiance, Ohio) Senator MCCAIN: Joe is with us today. Joe, where are you? Where is Joe? Is Joe here with us today? Joe, I thought you were here today. All right, well, you're all Joe the Plumbers. So all of you stand up and say - I thank you. HORSLEY: Joe did materialize at a later stop. His question and Obama's answer that he wants to spread the wealth around raises concerns with a lot of McCain supporters, like Todd Walters(ph) who attended a McCain rally in Pennsylvania earlier this week. Mr. TODD WALTERS: You know, Obama wants to take away our freedoms. He wants to turn the country into a socialist country. And you know, I think for once in my life, I'm trying to get everybody I can to stand for what's right. Otherwise, I think the country is in great danger. HORSLEY: Pennsylvania is one of the only blue states where McCain is still campaigning and hopes that a Republican upset there might offset Democratic gains elsewhere. Polls show McCain farther behind in Pennsylvania than either Ohio or Florida, but Walters thinks his state is not out of reach. Mr. WALTERS: You know, hopefully Pennsylvania will go for John McCain. I mean - and Sarah Palin. I mean, you know, we have two cities on either end that, you know, go Democrat, and everything else in between is rural. And I think, you know, we're John McCain country here. HORSLEY: McCain is hoping that's true next door as well, as he rolls through the stubbled cornfields of rural Ohio.

There were big outdoor events in North Carolina and Florida, a 30-minute prime-time infomercial, an appearance on Comedy Central and the first joint campaign rally with Bill Clinton.  STEVE INSKEEP, host: Barack Obama's record fundraising means record spending. And if it suddenly seems like he's everywhere, that's no accident. There were big outdoor events in North Carolina and Florida, network news interview, an appearance on \"Comedy Central,\" all yesterday on top of a 30-minute primetime infomercial shown on eight networking cable TV outlets.

Everywhere I go, despite the economic crisis and the war and uncertainty about tomorrow, I still see optimism and hope and strength. GONYEA: The half-hour program offered a big contrast to the gigantic rallies Obama has been holding. It featured a less iconic, more intimate version of the candidate. (Soundbite of Obama infomercial) Senator OBAMA: Mark Dowell and his wife Melinda have worked at the local plant for most of their adult lives. Recently the plant cut back Mark's work to every other week. Now they're struggling to make ends meet. GONYEA: Dowell's was one of four families featured in the program. (Soundbite of Obama infomercial) Mr. MARK DOWELL (Ford Employee): It was a lot better time back then. People thought they had security in their jobs. Senator OBAMA: In July, Melinda was laid off after eight years on the job. Mr. DOWELL: From the day I was born, I have been tied to Ford. So this is all I know. GONYEA: The 30 minutes wrapped up by cutting directly to a live in progress rally at a sports arena in Sunrise, Florida. (Soundbite of Democratic campaign rally, Sunrise, Florida) Senator OBAMA: America, the time for change has come. And to all of you and all of those who've joined us from across the country, in six days we can choose an economy that rewards work and creates jobs and fuels prosperity, starting with the middle class. GONYEA: And all day yesterday, Obama continued what his campaign calls his closing argument for the campaign. This is from Orlando. (Soundbite of Democratic campaign rally, Orlando, Florida) Senator OBAMA: Senator McCain still has not been able to tell the American people a single major thing that he'd do differently from George Bush when it comes to the economy. I am not - I'm not exaggerating. GONYEA: And Obama chided McCain and Sarah Palin. Senator OBAMA: Lately they've been calling a socialist. They found evidence that when I was in kindergarten I used to share my toys. When I was in fourth grade, I split my peanut butter sandwich and gave it to my friend. They said, look he's a redistributionist. GONYEA: In the past, this kind of all-day, all-out campaigning would be reserved for the last day before the election. But this year with millions of voters casting ballots early, every day in this final stretch is Election Day. Yesterday was a day unlike any other U.S. presidential candidate has ever staged. It is what Obama's record-setting fundraising has allowed him to do, kick things into a higher gear at this critical time to make sure the enthusiasm he's seen all year translates into actual votes.

Obama says President Bush has failed to address the crisis on Main Street, and that John McCain has failed to fully acknowledge it. The latest polls show Obama with a slight lead in Florida.  DON GONYEA: This is Don Gonyea in southern Florida where Barack Obama continues to make the economy the centerpiece of his campaign for votes in this battleground state. (Soundbite of economic forum, Palm Beach Community College) (Soundbite of crowd chanting \"Obama\") GONYEA: This event sounded like an Obama rally, but these supporters had come to Palm Beach Community College for an economic forum featuring Obama, several corporate leaders, and the governors of Colorado, Michigan, Ohio, and New Mexico. Obama offered a critical assessment of the current president and of the Republican nominee. (Soundbite of economic forum, Palm Beach Community College) Senator BARACK OBAMA (Democrat, Illinois; Democratic Presidential Candidate): While President Bush and Senator McCain were ready to move heaven and earth to address the crisis on Wall Street, President Bush has failed so far to address the crisis on Main Street. And Senator McCain has failed to fully acknowledge it. GONYEA: And while Obama himself pushed for and voted in favor of the recent congressional rescue plan for the financial sector, he said for middle-class Americans it's not enough. (Soundbite of economic forum, Palm Beach Community College) Senator OBAMA: Instead of common-sense solutions month after month, they've offered little more than willful ignorance, wishful thinking, outdated ideology. GONYEA: Next it was on to Miami and a big outdoor rally. The tally: 30,000 people. At this event, Obama noted that 115,000 jobs in Florida have disappeared just in the past year and that the state has sky-high foreclosure rates. But he also responded directly to recent attacks by John McCain, particularly the charge that some of Obama's proposals are socialism. (Soundbite of Democratic campaign rally) Senator OBAMA: Now first of all, I think it's hard to imagine that Colin Powell and Warren Buffett would endorse somebody socialistic. GONYEA: Latest polls do show Obama with a slight lead in Florida. Today Obama shifts his focus to foreign policy. He'll meet with his team of national security advisers in Richmond, Virginia.

            "article_content": "The western part of Virginia is supposed to be a Republican stronghold, but Barack Obama still managed to attract some 8,000 noisy supporters at a midday rally at the Roanoke Civic Center on Friday. Here's the Obama strategy at this late stage of the campaign: Hit Republican states hard, and if just one or two of them go Democratic, then John McCain's only path to victory is likely blocked. Virginia gives Obama one of his best chances to do that. The commonwealth hasn't voted for a Democrat for president since Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964. Since then, it's been red Republican for 10 straight elections. This year, however, the latest polls give Obama a lead here as big as 10 points. On Friday, Obama hammered away at McCain on health care. \"Sen. McCain has been eager to share some of the details of his health care plan, but not all of them,\" Obama called to the crowd. \"It's like those ads for prescription drugs. You know, they start off where everybody's running in the fields and everybody's happy. And then there's the little fine print that says, you know, side effects may include ...\" Obama then cited a Wall Street Journal article that said McCain's health care plan would be funded, at least in part, by cuts to the Medicare program. \"Eight-hundred-eighty-two billion dollars in Medicare cuts to pay for an ill-conceived, badly thought-through health care plan that won't provide more health care to people,\" he said. The McCain campaign says that figure is wrong and based on a study by a liberal think-tank. For Obama, it's an issue that he thinks will resonate with middle-class voters and the elderly. Ultimately, it's part of an economic argument that the Democrat hopes will help him win in Virginia and perhaps in other red states like Missouri where he campaigns Saturday.",

The final debate of the 2008 campaign featured some of the sharpest exchanges to date between Sens. Barack Obama and John McCain.  The tension between the two was heightened by the fact that for the first time in this debate season, the two men were seated right next to each other. Wednesday night's debate at Hofstra University in Hempstead, N.Y., focused primarily on domestic issues, and not surprisingly, the discussion turned immediately to the economy.  In his first question, moderater Bob Schieffer of CBS News asked the two candidates to compare their plans for solving the economic crisis. McCain defended his plan to buy up $300 billion worth of bad mortgages, and he criticized Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson for not taking this step. Obama said he wanted to focus his efforts on assistance to the middle class and quickly outlined his plans to create more jobs and cut taxes. McCain accused Obama of relying on \"class warfare\" and asked Obama why he would want to raise taxes at a time of economic distress. Obama insisted he is planning to raise taxes only for the richest Americans. Obama's tax plan would be better for the bottom 80 percent of Americans by income.  McCain's would favor the top 20 percent of Americans by income.  Obama said some Americans, such as investor Warren Buffett, could afford to pay a little more to finance a middle-class tax cut. The 90-minute debate began at 9 p.m. Eastern, just a few hours after the Dow Jones industrial average fell more than 700 points, nearly wiping out a record gain on Monday. Abortion And Judicial Nominees The two candidates had what may be their longest exchange about the issue of abortion.  They differed clearly in their answers to a question about whether they would apply a \"litmus test\" to Supreme Court nominees on whether they support the right to an abortion. McCain said that while he opposed the Supreme Court ruling in Roe v. Wade, he would not apply a litmus test to nominees.  But he said he believed the states should be allowed to decide abortion issues. Obama said that the right to an abortion should no more be open to states' interpretation then any other right, such as freedom of speech. He insisted that only a woman and her doctor should decide whether to choose abortion. Sparring Over The Bush Legacy McCain tried several times to seize the initiative and spoke directly to Obama. When Obama said that the Bush administration was responsible for the current budget deficit, McCain turned to him and said, \"Sen. Obama, I am not President Bush.  If you wanted to run against President Bush, you should have run four years ago.\" Obama linked McCain to President Bush over and over, saying that his Republican rival had backed the administration's economic policies. But McCain underscored his maverick status, saying he has the scars to prove that he has fought the president's policies when he felt it was important. McCain said he had opposed the administration by emphasizing the need to fight global warming and that he had fought the use of torture in the interrogation of suspected terrorists. Courting 'Joe The Plumber' On health care, the two went over some familiar ground. McCain accused Obama of planning to fine any business that does not provide health care to its employees. Obama reassured \"Joe the Plumber\" that small businesses would be exempt from such requirements.  The two argued throughout the debate over whether \"Joe\" would be better off under an Obama or a McCain administration. \"Joe\" is, in fact, Joe Wurzelbacher, who is trying to buy a plumbing business in Toledo, Ohio. Several days ago, Wurzelbacher told Obama that the Democrat's tax plan would keep him from buying that business.  Throughout the debate, \"Joe\" came to symbolize average Americans trying to run a business. The two candidates' positions on education are not that far apart, but during the debate they sought to emphasize their differences on a topic that has largely dropped out of the campaign. Obama said education was key to the country's economic future and outlined plans to give college students a $4,000 tuition tax credit. Obama also said that spending more on early childhood education would save money in the long run by producing higher student achievement. Obama also complained that No Child Left Behind was a good idea that was underfunded.  He said the federal government needs to step up with more funding for education. McCain said that throwing money at the problem was not the solution.  He said the answer for low-income parents was to give them the ability to choose another school if their local school was failing. McCain said that districts that have offered more choice have shown success and that charter schools offer an important alternative to failing public schools. Obama said that he, too, has been a supporter of charters. The Negativity Blame Game The two traded shots over who was responsible for the negative tone of the campaign.  McCain accused Obama of spending more on negative ads than any candidate in history.  He also denounced as \"hurtful\" remarks made by Rep. John Lewis of Georgia, a civil rights leader who compared some tactics of McCain supporters to those used by segregationist George Wallace. Obama said he had distanced himself from Lewis' comments. And he charged that every ad McCain had run in recent weeks was negative. According to the Wisconsin Advertising Project at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, \"nearly 100 percent\" of the ads that McCain ran in the week of Sept. 28 to Oct. 4 were negative. Obama's ads in that week were 34 percent negative. However, McCain was correct in saying that Obama has spent more on negative ads than he has. What McCain did not note is that Obama has spent more overall, since the Democrat opted out of the public financing system and can therefore raise unlimited amounts of funds. McCain also defended one of the more controversial charges that he has raised about Obama:  McCain said Obama's relationship with William Ayers deserves to be investigated.  Ayers is a college professor who has admitted to bombing the Pentagon while a member of the Weather Underground in the 1960s. He has served on a community board in Chicago with Obama. Obama tried to explain that he had only a distant association with Ayers, whose involvement with the Weather Underground dated back to when Obama was 8 years old. Obama said he would rather be known for his associations with leading military leaders and others who, he said, would serve as his advisers if he wins the White House. McCain was under intense pressure to use the debate as a springboard to overcome Obama's lead.  A Reuters/C-SPAN/Zogby poll released Tuesday showed Obama with a 6-point advantage, while a Washington Post-ABC News poll from Monday showed him with a 10-point lead among likely voters.",

            "article_content": "The issue that has taken over the upcoming election is the economy.  Uncertainty in the markets has forced presidential hopefuls Barack Obama and John McCain to adjust their economic proposals. Both candidates unveiled their plans this week \u2014 just in time for Wednesday's final debate.  RENEE MONTAGNE, Host: The financial-rescue plan is sure to be front and center tonight as the presidential candidates hold their third and final debate at Hofstra University in Long Island, New York. The focus is domestic policy, and the discussion is sure to be dominated by the turbulent economy. Both Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain retooled their economic proposals this week, just in time to debate them tonight. NPR's Don Gonyea reports. DON GONYEA: While both of these very different presidential candidates supported the president's rescue package for the financial sector with their votes in the Senate, their ideas on where to go from there diverge dramatically. For Barack Obama, the intense focus on the economy is a chance to heighten an issue on which Democrats have a distinct edge in the polls. On Monday, Obama introduced what he calls a rescue package for the middle class. And no surprise here, he did it in the battleground state of Ohio. S: So today I'm proposing a number of steps that we should take immediately to stabilize our financial system, provide relief to families and communities, and help struggling homeowners. It's a plan that begins with one word that's on everybody's mind, and it's easy to spell: J-O-B-S, jobs. (SOUNDBITE OF CROWD OVATION) GONYEA: McCain would allow senior citizens withdrawing cash from retirement accounts to pay taxes at the lowest income-tax rate for up to $50,000. He would also increase the dollar amount individuals can write off if they sell stocks at a loss. The current $3,000 limit would go to 15,000. And he revisits his longstanding call to cut capital gains taxes. S: This vital measure will promote buying, raise asset values, help companies, and shore up the pension plans for workers and retirees. GONYEA: McCain did endorse, if reluctantly, the Bush administration move to strengthen banks by using $250 billion federal to buy stock in banks and other financial institutions. Still, he offered this promise to taxpayers. S: We're going to get government out of the business of bailouts and equity stakes and back in the business of responsible regulation. Responsible regulation. (SOUNDBITE OF CROWD OVATION) S: We will learn from this crisis to prevent the next one, with much stricter oversight. GONYEA: A basic difference between these two plans is that McCain's measures do more for those who have been saving for a while: older people and those who are better off. McCain says his proposal will ultimately help business owners who can create jobs. And everyone, he says, will benefit from an improved job market. McCain added that his plan would reassure the country while, he says, Obama is the biggest risk the country has ever been asked to take. Yesterday afternoon, Obama held a brief news conference and reacted to one element of McCain's speech. S: I haven't looked at all the details of his capital gains proposal. I will tell you that nobody really has capital gains right now. So, if the idea is to cut capital gains taxes when I don't know anybody, even the smartest investors, who right now are going to be experiencing a lot of capital gains, that probably is not going to be particularly useful in solving the financial crisis. GONYEA: Obama did describe as a bad idea Senator McCain's earlier proposal to buy up mortgages from banks. That proposal would protect banks from losses but put taxpayers on the hook for those losses, at least temporarily. Tonight's debate will not be limited to the plans the two men laid out this week, but it will focus on the national anxiety those plans are intended to relieve. Don Gonyea, NPR News.

The plan was to rally votes for Barack Obama but much of the Clintons  speeches reminisced of Hillary's bid for the White House.  RENEE MONTAGNE, Host: This is Morning Edition from NPR News. I'm Renee Montagne. For the first time since Senator Hillary Clinton lost the Democratic presidential primary, she and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, campaigned together. That was yesterday, and it was for Barack Obama, the Democratic presidential nominee that they'd worked so hard to defeat earlier this year. The Clintons were joined Obama's running mate, Joe Biden, in Scranton, Pennsylvania where both Biden and Senator Clinton have family routes. NPR's David Welna was on hand and has this report. DAVID WELNA: Two big football games were televised at the same time as yesterday's Obama-Biden rally in downtown Scranton. Still, in the city where Hillary Clinton got nearly three-quarters of the votes in the Democratic primary, several thousand people did show up. They were greeted by one of Scranton's favorite sons, Pennsylvania Democratic Senator Bob Casey. BOB CASEY: We want to give a rousing Scranton and Lackawanna County welcome to President Clinton and Senator Clinton. (SOUNDBITE OF APPLAUSE) WELNA: The former president spoke first. He did not praise John McCain, as he did last month in a TV interview when he called the Republican nominee a great man. In fact, Clinton did not even mention McCain and he barely mentioned Obama. While he was generous in his praise for Biden, he spoke far more about his wife. BILL CLINTON: I just want to say something about what this election means to me and to Hillary and why we're here. I am profoundly grateful to all of you who helped me to serve and who supported her. More than you will ever know, I'm grateful. (SOUNDBITE OF APPLAUSE) WELNA: And in case anyone is keeping score, Bill Clinton pointed out that Hillary has done 50 events for Obama. CLINTON: She has not only done more to support him than any runner up in the Democratic primary process in my lifetime, she has done more than all the other runner ups come back, and that says a lot about why she ran for president and why she believes in him. (SOUNDBITE OF APPLAUSE) WELNA: Both Clintons will campaign this week in several states for Obama though Hillary, yesterday, sometimes still sounded like a candidate herself. HILLARY CLINTON: I haven't spent 35 years in the trenches fighting for universal health care, for children, for families, for women, for middle class people to see another Republican in the White House squander the promise of our nation and the hopes of our people. WELNA: Still, the New York senator did make clear she wants Obama to be the next president. CLINTON: And I am looking forward to being on the back lawn of the White House on a beautiful day like this when President Obama signs into law, quality affordable health care for you and you and you. (SOUNDBITE OF PEOPLE CHEERING) WELNA: She added that if Obama and Biden win Pennsylvania, there's no way they'll lose the White House. Biden for his part had only praise for both Clintons. But he disagreed with the image Hillary painted - standing on the White House lawn one sunny day. JOE BIDEN: No, no. She's going to be standing there handing the president the pen and taking the first pen when it's done because she, more than anyone else in America, will get it done. (SOUNDBITE OF PEOPLE CHEERING) WELNA: And Biden had a counter punch for Sarah Palin, who's criticized Biden for calling it patriotic to pay taxes. BIDEN: It is unpatriotic to take a hundred billion dollars offshore and not pay your taxes. That is unpatriotic. So I don't need a lecture on patriotism. I've had it to here. (SOUNDBITE OF PEOPLE CHEERING) WELNA: Polls show Obama leading McCain in Pennsylvania, but some voters have yet to decide. The owner of a Hoagie Sandwich shop just outside Scranton grinds a chunk of ham through a slicer. Chris, who does not give his last name, says he's still undecided. CHRIS: As for John McCain, I like John McCain. A lot of people do. As for Barack Obama, we all want him. We want change. We want good change, though. WELNA: Tomorrow, it's Sarah Palin's turn to campaign in Scranton. David Welna, NPR News. Copyright \u00a9 2008 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "If you have further questions regarding voting procedures, dates, deadlines or your registration, make sure to call your local election office or visit www.canivote.org. Listeners have submitted lots of questions about voting rules, and this Q&A attempts to answer some of those most frequently asked. Almost all states and many county election offices have good Web sites and toll-free phone numbers where you can find more specific answers. The National Association of Secretaries of State also has a Web site, www.canivote.org, where voters can check their registration status online, find their polling site and get other useful voting information specific to their state or county. \"I was told that it's illegal to wear any campaign 'paraphernalia' to the voting booth, even if it is simply a button or a T-shirt for your candidate. I was also told that if you wore this 'paraphernalia,' they can legally turn you away from voting. Is this true?\" \u2014 Rebecca Mielczarek, New York Many people asked similar questions, and unfortunately, the answer differs from state to state. In South Carolina, for example, voters are not allowed to wear any campaign paraphernalia, including T-shirts, at the polls. Alabama has no such clothing restrictions, though you can't loiter at the polls or leave any campaign material inside the polling place. In states that forbid campaign wear, officials usually will just ask the voter to remove the hat or button, and either cover up the shirt or turn it inside out. But in San Diego County, they've purchased several dozen paper smocks that voters can use to cover up any political messages. Otherwise, those voters will have to go home and change. It's best to check with your election office for the local rules, or else keep the campaign gear at home. \"I run into people who have served time in the penitentiary who think they are not allowed to vote. Is it true that after they have served their time and paid their debt to society, they do not get their full citizenship back?\" \u2014 Cathy Brec, Sioux Falls, S.D. It is true in some states. Former felons are permanently barred from voting in Virginia and Kentucky unless they can get the governor to restore their rights on an individual basis. Thirteen states and the District of Columbia automatically restore voting rights when an inmate is released from prison. Twenty states allow felons to vote only after they've completed probation and parole. Maine, Vermont and Puerto Rico allow convicted criminals to vote while they're still in prison. You can find a good analysis and a state-by-state breakdown here. \"Is it true that with early voting, which is the same as absentee voting in many states, the votes are only counted if there's a tie? Or are all votes counted regardless of the method used to cast them? I am seriously confused about whether I should vote early, or wait until Nov. 4.\" \u2014 Namita Biggins, Charlotte, N.C. All eligible absentee ballots and early votes are counted. It doesn't have to be a tie or even a close race for them to count. Usually they're tallied on Election Day, though sometimes absentee ballots \u2014 especially those from overseas \u2014 might not be counted until several days after the election. However, the votes are still included in the official results. Sometimes voters whose names aren't on the rolls or who don't have the proper ID will be asked to cast something called a provisional ballot. That ballot is counted only after election officials have verified that the voter is eligible. A fair number of provisional ballots get rejected, so it's best not to use one if you don't have to. \"I've heard of absentee ballots, but what is early voting, and how do the laws differ from state to state? \u2014 Rebecca Simmons, Phoenix Absentee ballots are usually done on paper and sent through the mail. In some states, you have to have an excuse to vote absentee, such as being out of town on Election Day. But in other states, anyone can vote absentee. Early in-person voting \u2014 allowed in 34 states \u2014 usually involves going to your local election office and voting on the same kind of equipment you'd be using on Election Day. It's one way officials hope to shorten the lines on Nov. 4. Here is a good breakdown of the state-by-state rules. \"My daughter is overseas right now and applied for an absentee ballot before she left. We asked that it be sent to her home address here in Bronx, N.Y., because she did not have an overseas address at that time. We still have not received it. When are absentee ballots typically mailed out? How can I follow up on her behalf to make sure we receive it in time to send it to her overseas, and then have her send it in to vote?\" \u2014 Mary Schiller, Bronx, N.Y. Getting absentee ballots out in time for overseas American voters is a common problem. Usually, states start sending out absentee ballots about 30 to 45 days before the election. You should probably call your local election office to see if they've been sent out yet. There's still time. Overseas ballots don't need to be received in New York until Nov. 17, though they must be postmarked by Nov. 3. And if your daughter doesn't get the ballot on time, there's something called the Federal Write-In Absentee Ballot that can be downloaded online and sent in instead. It will allow her to vote only in federal elections, though \u2014 for president and Congress. Two good sources for state-specific information on overseas voting can be found at www.overseasvotefoundation.org and at www.fvap.gov. \"Will the Postal Service deliver mail-in ballots that don't have sufficient postage?\" \u2014 Marilyn Gildea, Mountain View, Calif. This is a question that comes up a lot, because absentee ballots often weigh more than an ounce, which means more than a $0.42 stamp is required. Some jurisdictions note this on the envelope, but others don't. The U.S. Postal Service says it will deliver an absentee ballot even if it doesn't have sufficient postage, though the local election office could get stuck with the bill. \"What is being done to ensure that an appropriate amount of voting machines will be placed in voting districts? For the past couple of presidential elections, there were disproportionate voting resources available for African-American communities as opposed to white, middle-class communities across town.\" \u2014 Valdez Bravo, Portland, Ore. There have been problems, especially in 2004, with much longer lines in some precincts than in others. The worst problems were in Ohio, where some people had to wait up to 10 hours to vote in the last presidential election. The longest lines tended to be in urban areas and on college campuses. This year in Ohio, election officials are trying to make sure that there's at least one machine for every 175 registered voters and additional machines placed in areas that experienced heavy turnout in the past. There will also be paper ballots available for voters who want to use them. But every state is different. Virginia, for example, only requires a minimum of one machine for every 750 voters. A lot of it is just a guessing game. Officials never know who's going to show up, or how much the lines will be affected by broken machines, long ballots or confused voters. They're further hampered by the fact that they had to decide how many machines to purchase well before voter registration deadlines this month. So it's very possible you'll see some long lines this year, and that's why so many election officials are encouraging people to vote early if they can. \"What will happen on Nov. 4 if the polls are scheduled to close and there's still people waiting in line to vote. And what if there aren't enough paper ballots available?\" \u2014 Barbara Arnold, Boulder, Colo. Anyone waiting in line at poll-closing time should be allowed to vote. In some instances, when things have gotten out of hand on Election Day \u2014 with a lot of broken machines or confusion \u2014 parties and candidates have gone to court to have polling hours extended. In those cases, voters have to cast provisional ballots, which are counted later. As for places running out of paper ballots, that does happen. Some states or counties will allow you to write down your choices on any piece of paper if the regular ballots run out, but others won't. Voters might just have to wait until election officials can deliver more ballots to their precinct. Most jurisdictions have been increasing the number of paper ballots they have on hand to avoid such situations, but with this year's expected high turnout, it could be a problem. \"When is the best time of day for me to vote? I am slightly disabled and would like to avoid a long line.\" \u2014 Jean Dreifort, Beachwood, Ohio Generally, polls are busiest first thing in the morning and shortly before closing time, and there's often a spike at lunchtime. So the best time to avoid a long line would be mid-morning or mid-afternoon. It's also possible that your local poll workers will allow you to come to the front of the line instead of waiting. \"My husband is a recent citizen after being a legal resident for many years. He is voting for the first time in a presidential election. When he voted in the primary election, we found out that he was registered incorrectly, with his first and last names switched. They let him vote without any problem, but he wants to make sure there won't be one when he goes to vote on Nov. 4. Where would he go to correct the mistake?\" \u2014 Dorothea Naouai, Bloomfield, N.J. It's a good idea for voters, especially new ones, to make sure their registrations are in order, especially if they have not received a voter card or confirmation in the mail. You can check the status of your registration by calling your local election office or by going online. Thirty-one states allow you to check your registration online, and you can access those sites through canivote.org. You can also find out where your polling place is. This is important, because if you go to the wrong place, your name won't be on the rolls and they might have you cast a provisional ballot, which might not be counted if it's cast in the wrong precinct.

            "article_content": "New Mexico will be an important state in November's presidential election. It's among the states that could go for either Barck Obama or John McCain. Some Albuquerque voters remain, for the most part, decidedly undecided after watching Tuesday night's presidential debate.  ARI SHAPIRO, Host: This is Morning Edition from NPR News. I'm Ari Shapiro. STEVE INSKEEP, Host: And I'm Steve Inskeep. Good morning. Our colleague Renee Montagne is reporting from one of the states that may decide this fall's presidential election. She spent last evening at a debate party in Albuquerque, New Mexico. That's a state that went for George W. Bush in 2004 by just a few thousand votes. It went for Al Gore, the Democrat, in 2000 by just a few hundred votes. Now, New Mexico is among the states that could go either way, possibly depending on the decisions of voters like the ones who watched the debate with Renee. RENEE MONTAGNE: And Steve, this group of 15 undecided voters were undecided, it seemed, because they were taking their votes very seriously. Host Margaret Aragon De Chavez, herself an undecided Democrat because she's not quite over Hillary Clinton, had brought together registered voters from both parties. MONTAGNE: And I'd like to welcome everybody, and really quickly we have note pads for note-taking. If you want to just write down any information during the debate. You don't have to... MONTAGNE: Margaret Aragon De Chavez is used to giving political parties. She was once the first lady of Albuquerque when she was married to a three-term mayor. MONTAGNE: So I think everybody has introduced themselves. So the debates, I think, we have maybe a few more minutes. My clocks are always ahead because I'm always running late! (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER) MONTAGNE: And so, make yourself at home. This is an important debate. MONTAGNE: Aragon De Chavez had one main rule, civility. No hooting, no cheering, no groaning, and once it was over, everyone crowded around her kitchen table and offered opinions. Strikingly, a fair number who were leaning towards one candidate moved over last night to the other. MONTAGNE: OK, Dominic. MONTAGNE: Now, it was one of the things that was kind of annoying me is he kept bringing Bush, Bush, Bush, and I was like, well, I don't want to hear any more about what Bush did because it's over. He's a lame duck president. You know, what's the solution? How are we going to move forward? And really the only question that I - that was really answered from Obama that seemed clear-cut to me was the one that he had on health care. As far as John McCain though, the thing that really appealed to me about him is his idea of how to bail the housing market out, actually buy the values and renegotiate them. So really, at this point, I'm kind of leaning towards McCain. MONTAGNE: Dominic Aragon is a student in his late 20s who started a high=tech company. His switch from Obama to McCain was seconded by another young man at the table, and then challenged by a woman in her 30s. MONTAGNE: I actually heard something completely different than what you guys did in the sense that I thought McCain was pointing the finger a lot. And I did actually capture more solid answers from Obama than I did from McCain, such as like the tax credits that are going to be going on for businesses, for insurance, and his answer with health care, and how it's a right instead of a responsibility, and his priorities kind of align more with mine as far energy, health care and (unintelligible) security, so it's interesting that I heard something completely different. MONTAGNE: Valerie Quintana is a behavioral health outreach worker for the state. And she said she came in truly undecided. Now, she'll probably vote for Obama. And then, there's Martinique(ph) Chavez who surprised her Democratic mother by registering as a Republican. At 18, she'll be voting for the first time. MONTAGNE: I've been swaying towards McCain this entire election. And after watching these debates, I've become more undecided because I think that I need to wait till another debate and see and learn more of the facts. MONTAGNE: In New Mexico, right now, polls show 14 percent of the voters are undecided. That's about twice the national average. Barack Obama does have a five-point lead here over John McCain, but one guest at last night's debate party may well have predicted how long the uncertainty will last. Jim Rivera said he was leaving the party having made a decision and that decision is he still needs more information. MONTAGNE: So I will be looking and reading and following closely for the rest of the campaign here up until probably the day of voting. MONTAGNE: In Albuquerque, New Mexico, I'm Renee Montagne.

            "article_content": "Presidential hopefuls Barack Obama and John McCain debated Tuesday night at Belmont University in Nashville, Tenn. The two clashed over the economic crisis, taxes, health care, energy and foreign policy.  STEVE INSKEEP, Host: It's Morning Edition from NPR News. I'm Steve Inskeep. ARI SHAPIRO, Host: And I'm Ari Shapiro, sitting in for Renee Montagne. Senator John McCain's campaign spoke this week of turning the page from the economy to other issues. There was no chance of that at last night's presidential debate. The candidates met on the same day that the Dow Jones Industrials lost another 500 points. INSKEEP: Even as Barack Obama and John McCain took questions from voters, Asian markets were beginning another plunge. The drops came in response to more fears about the credit markets and talk of recession, and news like that provided the starting point of the discussion moderated by NBC's Tom Brokaw. Here's NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson. MARA LIASSON: It was clear from the very first question from Allan Shaffer what voters in the audience wanted to hear - specific solutions to help their families get through the economic crisis. ALLAN SHAFFER: With the economy on the downturn and retired and older citizens and workers losing their incomes, what's the fastest, most positive solution to bail these people out of the economic ruin? LIASSON: Barack Obama blamed the Bush administration and John McCain for pushing deregulation, and he said the first step was the rescue package for Wall Street that Congress passed last week. BARACK OBAMA: The middle-class need a rescue package. And that means tax cuts for the middle-class. It means help for homeowners so that they can stay in their homes. It means that we are helping state and local governments set up road projects and bridge projects that keep people in their jobs. And then long-term, we've got to fix our health care system, we've got to fix our energy system that is putting such an enormous burden on families. You need somebody working for you and you've got to have somebody in Washington who is thinking about the middle class and not just those who can afford to hire lobbyists. LIASSON: Senator McCain had a brand new policy proposal that he unveiled on the spot, saying the problem had become so severe that something had to be done to stabilize home values. JOHN MCCAIN: You know that home values of retirees continues to decline and people are no longer able to afford their mortgage payments. As President of the United States, Allan, I would order the Secretary of the Treasury to immediately buy up the bad home loan mortgages in America and renegotiate at the new value of those homes - at the diminished value of those homes and let people make those - be able to make those payments and stay in their homes. Is it expensive? Yes. LIASSON: Both Obama and McCain had promised to take off the gloves, but the back and forth last night was not nearly as harsh as the candidates' rhetoric on the campaign trail or in their ads. It's hard to be aggressive and personal when you're standing right next to your opponent answering questions from voters. Still, they managed to clash repeatedly over taxes even when the questions were about something else. MCCAIN: You know, nailing down Senator Obama's various tax proposals is like nailing Jell-O to the wall. There has been five or six of them and if you wait long enough, there will probably be another one. But he wants to raise taxes. My friends, the last president to raise taxes during tough economic times was Herbert Hoover. LIASSON: And McCain accused Obama of wanting to raise taxes on small businesses. MCCAIN: Small businesses across America will have to cut jobs and will have their taxes increase and won't be able to hire because of Senator Obama's tax policies. You know, he said some time ago, he said, he would forgo his tax increases if the economy was bad. I've got some news, Senator Obama, the news is bad. So let's not raise anybody's taxes, my friends. OBAMA: Senator McCain, I think the 'Straight Talk Express' lost a wheel on that one. LIASSON: Obama shot back that McCain wanted to give a hundred billion dollars in tax cuts to CEOs on Wall Street. OBAMA: I want to provide a tax cut for 95 percent of Americans. 95 percent. If you make less than a quarter million dollars a year, you will not see a single dime of your taxes go up. If you make $200,000 a year or less, your taxes will go down. Now, Senator McCain talks about small businesses. Only a few percent of small businesses make more than $250,000 a year. So the vast majority of small businesses would get a tax cut under my plan. LIASSON: McCain's poll numbers have been dropping ever since the economic crisis began. The Democrats' traditional advantage on the economy has given Obama a boost, nationally and in key battleground states. So, McCain came to this debate with the heavier burden. His goal was to raise doubts about Obama's ability to lead. He found an opportunity when Phil Elliot asked a question about foreign policy. PHIL ELLIOT: Senator McCain, how will all the recent economic stress affect our nation's ability to act as a peacemaker in the world? MCCAIN: That question has - can only be answered with someone with the knowledge and experience and the judgment, the judgment to know when our national security is not only at risk, but where the United States of America can make a difference in preventing genocide, in preventing the spread of terrorism, in doing the things that the United States has done, not always well, but we've done because we're a nation of good. LIASSON: And McCain compared his record on Lebanon, Bosnia and Iraq to Obama's. MCCAIN: Senator Obama was wrong about Iraq and the surge. He was wrong about Russia when they committed aggression against Georgia. And in his short career, he does not understand our national security challenges. We don't have time for on-the-job training, my friend. TOM BROKAW: Senator Obama, the economic constraints on US military action around the world. OBAMA: Well, you know, Senator McCain, in the last debate and today, again, suggested that I don't understand. It's true. There are some things I don't understand. I don't understand how we ended up invading a country that had nothing to do with 9/11, while Osama Bin Laden and Al-Qaeda are setting up base camps and safe havens to train terrorists to attack us. That was Sen. McCain's judgment and it was the wrong judgment. When Senator McCain was cheerleading the president to go into Iraq, he suggested it was going to be quick and easy, we'd be greeted as liberators. That was the wrong judgment, and it's been costly to us. LIASSON: In his closing statement, Obama relied on the classic question of a challenger. Are you better off now than you were eight years ago? And he answered it. OBAMA: Wages and incomes have gone down. People have lost their health care or are going bankrupt because they get sick. We've got young people who have got the grades and the will and the drive to go to college, but they just don't have the money. And we can't expect that if we do the same things that we've been doing over the last eight years, that somehow we are going to have a different outcome. We need fundamental change. That's what's at stake in this election. That's the reason I decided to run for president, and I'm hopeful that all of you are prepared to continue this extraordinary journey that we call America. But we're going to have to have the courage and the sacrifice, the nerve, to move in a new direction. LIASSON: Obama has been riding a wave of anger at Washington and fear about the economy. McCain has been fighting that same tide as it grew stronger and stronger all year. Last night, he had the last word and he offered himself and his record as the answer. MCCAIN: I know what it's like in dark times. I know what it's like to have to fight to keep one's hope going through difficult times. I know what it's like to rely on others for support and courage and love in tough times. I know what it's like to have your comrades reach out to you and your neighbors and your fellow citizens and pick you up and put you back in the fight. That's what America's all about. I believe in this country. I believe in its future. I believe in its greatness. It's been my great honor to serve it for many, many years. And I'm asking the American people to give me another opportunity. LIASSON: It's unlikely that last night's encounter will change the dynamic of the race, but there's still one debate left, next Wednesday night in Hempstead, New York at Hofstra University. The topic will be domestic and economic policy. Mara Liasson, NPR News, Nashville, Tennessee. Copyright \u00a9 2008 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama campaigned Monday in North Carolina, where he told supporters that Congress should pass an economic stimulus package to help American families. He also said John McCain lacks the understanding necessary to fix the troubled economy.  AUDIE CORNISH: And I'm Audie Cornish with the Obama campaign in Asheville, North Carolina. Senator Barack Obama stuck to his message on the economy yesterday. BARACK OBAMA: Before we go get barbecue, I just wanted to make a brief statement about the economy. CORNISH: Just before heading to a campaign stop at a barbecue joint, Obama told reporters that Congress should pass another economic stimulus package to help American families. He also fired back at comments by the McCain campaign on Saturday. A senior McCain aide then said that they were looking to, quote, \"turn a page on the financial crisis.\" OBAMA: And the notion that we would want to brush that aside and engage in the usual political shenanigans and smear tactics that have come to characterize too many political campaigns, I think is not what the American people are looking for... CORNISH: North Carolina went to George W. Bush in 2004, but this time Obama has worked to make the state competitive. At a rally on Sunday, Obama focused almost exclusively on issues such as health care reform, his job growth strategy and, of course, the economy. OBAMA: In 30 days, you are going to elect the next president. And you deserve, and you need a president who's going to wake up every single day and fight for you, fight for the middle class, fight to create jobs and grow our economy again. CORNISH: Asheville resident Evelyn Zebro(ph) was at the rally and said she liked what the candidate had to say, but she would like to see Obama step it up against his rivals tonight. EVELYN ZEBRO: I'd like him to, maybe if anything, without being an attack dog like John McCain, maybe be a little bit more aggressive. But I think he's done a good job so far, and I know he'll continue to do a good job. CORNISH: Some of that has already begun. In North Carolina and other battleground states, Obama is releasing Internet and TV ads at a dizzying rate. The ads go after McCain on everything from economic policy to health care and even raised the Republican's involvement in a savings and loan scandal two decades ago.

            "article_content": "Democratic hopeful Barack Obama campaigned Thursday in Michigan. That's where he began the week.  Michigan already seems to be a win for Obama. The McCain campaign confirmed Thursday that it is pulling out of Michigan.  RENEE MONTAGNE, host: After casting votes for the revised financial bailout plan in Washington, Senators John McCain and Barack Obama are back looking for votes. McCain headed to Colorado. Obama ended the week where he started it, in Michigan. ARI SHAPIRO, host: The state went for Kerry in 2004, and McCain had been working to put it in play for Republicans this year. At least he was until yesterday. The McCain campaign is pulling out of Michigan. MONTAGNE: In a moment, we'll hear from NPR's Scott Horsley on that decision. First, NPR's Audie Cornish reports on Senator Obama's stay. AUDIE CORNISH: Senator Barack Obama had Michigan all to himself. But you wouldn't know it from his schedule. The senator campaigned in the heavily Republican area of Grand Rapids and followed that up with a huge rally in East Lansing. After the crazy week on Wall Street, voter Karen Sprecher (ph) said more than anything, she needed to hear what Obama had to say about the economy. Ms. KAREN SPRECHER (Resident, Grand Rapids, Michigan): Well, I am totally convinced who I am voting for, so he doesn't need to convince me. What he needs to do in Michigan, I suppose, is give some hope to some people who - we're in just a bad state here, and there are so many people without jobs. It just really concerns me, because that's the nitty-gritty. That's the everyday... CORNISH: And for Sprecher and the thousands who rallied at Michigan State University, Obama didn't disappoint. (Soundbite of campaign rally) Senator BARACK OBAMA (Democrat, Illinois; 2008 Democratic Presidential Nominee): Can you retire with dignity and respect? Can you avoid bankruptcy when you get sick? Can you send your child to college so they can have bigger dreams than you did? Opportunity for every American, that's what we're fighting for. That's what this election is about. CORNISH: When it's time to get specific about his economic philosophy, Obama pitches both major spending and major cutting. For example, a pledge to spend $15 billion for a green energy manufacturing sector is followed by vague promises to save billions by cutting waste in government programs. And despite the multibillion dollar bailout and looming deficit, Obama says his platform is still doable. Sen. OBAMA: And there is no doubt that some programs or policies that I proposed on the campaign trail may require more time to achieve. But I reject the idea that you can't build a strong middle class at a time when our economy is weak. I believe building a strong middle class is the key to making our economy strong. And that's what we'll do when I am president. CORNISH: Obama hardly mentioned his rival, John McCain, which was fine with Joanne Westfall (ph). She says the Democratic nominee needs to stay focused on the things she believes he's stood for so far. Ms. JOANNE WESTFALL (Resident, Michigan): Honesty, accountability, courage and honor - and if he begins to hammer on those principals rather than on the values that the Republicans for that last eight years have touted and really have not delivered on, I think that will make the difference. CORNISH: For now, Obama has Westfall's vote and, according to the polls, the support of the majority of voters across the state. Audi Cornish, NPR News, Lansing, Michigan. Copyright \u00a9 2008 NPR.

Barack Obama greets supporters at a rally Wednesday in La Crosse, Wis. Obama's speech concentrated on the economy and the continued turmoil on Wall Street. Sen. Barack Obama and Sen. John McCain are back in Washington, D.C., where they are expected to cast ballots in support of the financial bailout legislation when the Senate votes Wednesday night. Obama flew from La Crosse, Wis., where he held a morning campaign rally, and landed in Washington just before 4 p.m. An hour and a half later, he was on the floor of the U.S. Senate, arguing in favor of passing the $700 billion package designed to rescue the financial sector and avert an even more dire situation for the nation's economy. Obama said the package is not perfect and that he remains critical of what he calls the mismanagement of the economy, but he said action now is crucial. \"It's clear that from my perspective this is what we have to do right now to prevent the possibility of a crisis turning into a catastrophe,\" the Illinois Democrat said. Obama said he understands that many of his colleagues in Congress \u2014 Democrats and Republicans \u2014 have problems with the plan, but he urged them to step up and support it or risk the nation's sliding into a deep and painful recession. He pointed to safeguards in the package and said it is not a welfare plan for CEOs. Taxpayers become investors under the plan, Obama stressed, adding that he expects every dollar spent to come back to the American public once markets stabilize and regain strength. Obama acknowledged this will take time and that there are no guarantees. As he wrapped up his 15-minute statement in the Senate, Obama invoked the words of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt during a fireside chat. \"During the great financial crisis of the last century, in his first fireside chat, FDR told his fellow Americans that there is an element in the readjustment of our financial system more important than currency, more important than gold, and that is the confidence of the people themselves,\" Obama said. \"Confidence and courage are the essentials of success in carrying out our plan.\" Earlier in the day, Obama was campaigning is Wisconsin, where he said people are right to be outraged at how much this will cost taxpayers. \"But it is clear that this is what we must do right now to prevent a crisis from turning into a catastrophe,\" he said during a speech in the town of La Crosse. \"That's why I've been reaching out to leaders in both parties to do whatever I can to help pass this plan.\" Obama clearly affixes blame for the crisis on what he calls a philosophy of deregulation in Washington that took hold in the 1980s and has escalated under the Bush administration. He says it's no accident that the nation's economy got into such deep trouble. \"Make no mistake: We need to end an era in Washington where accountability has been absent, oversight has been overlooked and your tax dollars have been turned over to wealthy CEOs and well-connected corporations,\" he said. \"You need leadership that you can trust to work for you \u2014 not for the special interests who have had their thumb on the scale.\" Obama's speech in La Crosse had a populist feel. He said middle-class Americans will step up and rescue Wall Street because the entire economy and millions of jobs depend on it.",

            "article_content": "Barack Obama campaigned in Reno, Nev., Tuesday before a crowd of 12,000 people. But he didn't give a rip-roaring, crowd-pleasing speech. Instead, the Democratic presidential nominee explained why middle-class Americans have a stake in the Wall Street bailout plan.  STEVE INSKEEP, host: Now let's take a sampling of the Obama campaign. Here's NPR's Don Gonyea. DON GONYEA: It looked like just another big outdoor \"Obama for President\" rally, this one on the campus of the University of Nevada, Reno. Bright sunshine, 12,000 people. But Obama cautioned that this would not be a, quote, \"rip-roaring campaign speech.\" That wouldn't be appropriate, he said, given the events of the day before. Speaking for some 40 minutes, he never once mentioned John McCain. Instead, he spent much of his time offering a sobering explanation of why middle-class Americans with all their justifiable outrage and anger have a great deal riding on the rescue package. Senator BARACK OBAMA (Democrat, Illinois; Democratic Presidential Nominee): And it wasn't just the wealth of a few CEOs on Wall Street. The 401(k)s and retirement accounts that millions of people count on for their families' futures are now smaller. GONYEA: He said state pension funds of teachers and government employees lost billions of dollars. Senator OBAMA: Hardworking Americans who invested their nest egg to watch it grow are now watching it disappear. GONYEA: He continued a grim litany, saying families will have a harder time getting loans for things like college. Businesses will have a harder time getting credit to make payroll or to pay suppliers. Senator OBAMA: What it means is that thousands of businesses could close around the country. Millions of jobs could be lost. A long and painful recession could follow. GONYEA: Obama said if Congress can't get a rescue deal passed, the consequences would be disastrous. He also called on Democrats and Republicans who voted against the package on Monday to step up with ideas they have. Senator OBAMA: It's not a time for politicians to concern themselves with the next election. It's a time for all of us to concern ourselves with the future of the country that we love. This is a time for action. (Soundbite of cheers and applause) GONYEA: Today, Senator Obama holds a rally in La Crosse, Wisconsin, where he'll talk about the new plan just before heading back to Washington to vote on it.

            "article_content": "John McCain and Barack Obama called for the government to raise the limit on federal insurance for bank deposits from $100,000 to $250,000. Both also tried to hammer home the importance of congressional action on the bailout.  MELISSA BLOCK, host: The financial crisis was also on the minds of the presidential candidates today, and we're joined now by two of our correspondents covering the campaign. Scott Horsley is with John McCain in Des Moines, Iowa, and Don Gonyea is with Barack Obama in Reno, Nevada. And, Don, let's start with you. The day began with a statement from Senator Obama suggesting that the government raise the limit on federal insurance for bank deposits. He wants it raised from $100,000 to $250,000. DON GONYEA: Right. They put out an early, early morning statement. They wanted to make sure it was on the news this morning. He said $100,000 is plenty for most families, but the concern is that for small businesses, that need to have more cash on hand. They have cash in bank accounts to make payroll or to pay suppliers. That $100,000 limit just isn't enough. It hasn't been adjusted for inflation in close to 30 years, so by boosting it to $250,000, they feel like they can help restore some confidence in the system for everybody. BLOCK: And, Scott Horsley, it wasn't long after that that we heard much the same idea coming from John McCain. SCOTT HORSLEY: Yeah, it's remarkable, Melissa. These two very different candidates arriving at the same place, the idea of being on the one hand to provide some additional protection for depositors and make the measure a little bit more popular with voters, and perhaps sway some reluctant lawmakers in the House. Senator McCain took turns today chastising House lawmakers for failing to show leadership during this difficult economic time, and then in almost the same breath, pleading for a bipartisan buy-in going forward. Senator JOHN MCCAIN (Republican, Arizona; Presidential Candidate): I know that many of the solutions to this problem may be unpopular, but the dire consequences of inaction will be far more damaging to the economic security of American families and the fault will all be ours. BLOCK: So that's John McCain. And, Don Gonyea, also a similar message today from Barack Obama. GONYEA: Well, you know, he talked about why this matters to Main Street and about how outrage is certainly being felt, maybe justifiably, anger at Wall Street that everybody is going down this road together in this country. And you know how Obama is often accused of using language that's too lofty, too professorial? Well, listen to this passage laying out what this means for the middle class, even if what's going on isn't their fault. Give a listen. Senator BARACK OBAMA (Democrat, Illinois; Presidential Candidate): Think about it. If your neighbor's house is burning, you're not going to spend a whole lot of time saying, well, that guy was always irresponsible. He always left the stove on. He always was smoking in bed. All those things may be true, but his house could end up affecting your house. And that's the situation we're in right now. We've got to make sure that we put the fire out and then we'll start making sure that these folks stop leaving the stove on. GONYEA: And if I might just add quick thing, this speech was mostly about the financial crisis today. It looked like a rally, 12,000 people, but Senator Obama did not once mention the name John McCain. BLOCK: Scott Horsley, let's turn back to you. The message from congressional Democrats is that it was Republicans who defeated this bailout bill in the House. What is John McCain doing to try to get his colleagues back on board? HORSLEY: That's right, Melissa. You know, two-thirds of House Republicans voted against this measure even though it had the strong support of the Republican president and the Republican standard-bearer. John McCain is trying hard to get more Republicans to come in line and support the rescue package. At the same time, he's saying there are things the administration can do on its own, with the stroke of a pen, he said. For example, the Treasury Department already has authority to buy up mortgage backed securities, to take steps to protect money market accounts, and Senator McCain urged the Treasury to use those powers creatively. BLOCK: OK, we've been talking with NPR's Scott Horsley in Des Moines, Iowa and Don Gonyea in Reno, Nevada. Thanks to you both. GONYEA: It's a pleasure. HORSLEY: Good to be with you.

One candidate is highly experienced, while the other is a relative novice. One is a new star in the political sky, while the other is a bit of an old hat. And if Republican Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin is not saying much on the campaign trail, Democratic Sen. Joseph Biden may be saying too much \u2014 or, at least, not always thinking before he spouts off. He recently criticized an anti-Obama ad, even though he had not seen it. His remarks on a rope line sparked a firestorm of controversy in coal states. He also asked a guy in a wheelchair to stand up during a rally. And then there was this remark, made at a fundraiser last week \u2014 on camera \u2014 to CBS: \"When the stock market crashed, Franklin Roosevelt got on television and didn't just talk about the princes of greed. He said, 'Look, here's what happened.'\" The problem with that statement: Roosevelt was not yet president when the market crashed in 1929, and there was no TV. Famous in the Senate for his long-windedness, Biden has disciplined himself more this year. But he still tends to loose lips that can, if not sink ships, at least make troublesome waves. In an interview with NPR, he dismissed his gaffes as not really serious. \"The real gaffes are McCain's gaffes,\" he said. \"McCain's gaffes affect people's lives. McCain going from, at 9 o'clock in the morning ... deciding the economy is strong, to 11 o'clock, deciding the economy is in crisis. I am who I am.\" Biden On The Campaign Trail Biden does not get anything like the crowds that Palin attracts. His rallies more typically attract a few thousand at best. But his schedule is backbreaking. From early in the morning to late at night, he is speaking at public rallies and at fundraisers, where in one day last week he raised $1.8 million. In the two days NPR spent with Biden, he was in suburban Virginia, Baltimore, Cincinnati, Louisville, southern Indiana, western Pennsylvania and, finally, Rhode Island. His speeches are long, but not boring. They are substantive and full of Democratic propaganda. Take his discussion of McCain's health care proposal, which he notes, accurately, would count employer health plans as income, meaning that the average family policy would add $12,000 to taxable income. \"If you're making $40,000 a year, you'll pay taxes on $52,000 a year. If you're making $50,000 a year, you'll pay taxes on $62,000 a year. Ladies and gentlemen, it's the largest tax increase in the history of America for the middle class,\" he said. This almost always provokes groans from the crowd, but what Biden fails to say is that McCain's proposal would more than offset the increase for most people with tax credits for privately purchased insurance. 'This Is Not The John McCain I Knew' As Biden often observes, he has known McCain for more than three decades. They've been pals since 1974, when the Navy assigned McCain to work as a staffer for Biden, then a young senator. Biden, in his NPR interview last week, conceded that he has grown increasingly uncomfortable with what he calls McCain's personal attacks on Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama. \"I try to keep telling myself that John really doesn't know what his campaign is doing and some of the scurrilous stuff that it's doing,\" Biden said. \"I mean, this is not the John McCain that I knew. The John McCain I knew, on the economy, I thought was wrong 25 years ago,\" he said. \"The ambivalence I have is thinking, 'Say it ain't so, John.' This can't be your campaign.\" Not that Biden has any difficulty attacking McCain's policies on, for example, the economy. \"Where was John a week ago?\" he says. \"Where was John a month ago? Where was John five years ago? Well, I'll tell you where he was. He was bragging to the Wall Street titans \u2014 that he now calls the merchants of greed \u2014 that he was shredding the regulations that were tying them down.\" An Instinct For Connecting With People Biden is the quintessential happy warrior. After a 30 or 40 minute speech, he usually spends as much time working the rope line: talking to people, hugging and kissing the women, holding the hands of the disabled, asking youngsters where they go to school and what they want to do, and hearing sad tales from veterans. A staff aide walks alongside, taking people's cameras from them, snapping a photo with Joe and then handing the camera back. You could call it a virtuoso political performance, but it seems to energize the candidate. He has an instinct for connecting with people. Talking about the thousands of foreclosures this year, he talks not just about the numbers. \"We Democrats know foreclosure is more than a word,\" Biden said at a recent campaign stop. \"It means turning to your son or daughter and saying, 'You've got to empty the bedroom, honey.' It means you can't come back to the neighborhood. You can't play in the same ball club.\" At every stop, he always finds a personal bond. At a sun-splashed outdoor rally in Jeffersonville, Ind., he points across the river to Kentucky. \"The best thing that ever came out of Kentucky was my sister-in-law from Owensville,\" he said. \"How she puts up with my brother, I don't know.\" At fundraisers in Baltimore and Louisville, he points to former senators and recounts how they taught him everything he knows. Before a national Jewish group, he talks about his first trip to Israel. And in Greensburg, Pa., after being introduced by the owner of the Pittsburgh Steelers, Dan Rooney, he remembered his first contact with the Rooney family. It happened in 1972, when Biden's first wife and his daughter were killed in a car accident, and his critically injured two sons were in the hospital. Two days before Christmas, Biden remembered that he left the boys' room for a couple of hours to buy a Christmas tree for them.  When he returned, each youngster had a football, signed by the Steelers \u2014 a gift arranged by Dan Rooney's father. As he told the story, Biden suddenly found himself choking back tears and wiping his eyes. Later, he said he'd not expected to find himself transported back to that moment. \"It really embarrassed me that I became emotional in doing it. I will not try to do it again,\" he said. Biden knows vice presidents usually have relatively little influence. As he puts it, in his job as chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, presidents have to go through him. If he is vice president, the president can just run over him. So why did he take the job? After all, if his ticket wins, this will likely be his swan song. After two terms, he would be 74. \"No matter how successful what I push for may be in the Senate, the only way we're going to fundamentally change the country is through the White House,\" he said. \"You need a president fundamentally changing the direction.\" Going Up Against Palin This week, Biden will be debating Palin. For the six-term senator, this might seem an easy task. But Biden has more than gaffes to worry about. Debating a woman has particular perils. He has to worry about looking condescending or like a know-it-all. And because of his long experience, people expect him to do better. Still, he maintains that he isn't worried. \"I'm used to debating strong senators who happen to be women, so I'm not going to do anything different than I have before,\" he said.",

            "article_content": "Democrat Barack Obama on Monday blamed lax oversight and loose regulation for the financial breakdown. The Illinois senator attacked comments made by Republican rival John McCain and his idea of trickle-down economics.  SCOTT HORSLEY: And I'm Scott Horsley in Colorado where John McCain's observation that the fundamentals of the economy are still strong drew an immediate rebuke from Barack Obama. Senator BARACK OBAMA (Democrat, Illinois; 2008 Democratic Presidential Nominee): Senator McCain, what economy are you talking about? What's more fundamental than the ability to find a job that pays the bills and that can raise a family? HORSLEY: Even after McCain rephrased his statement later in the day, saying it was the American worker he meant was strong, Obama didn't let up. We know what you meant the first time, Obama said, because McCain has said the same thing before. Senator OBAMA: So I congratulate Senator McCain for saying something good about American workers. I think it's good that Senator McCain is celebrating the American worker today. But it would have been nice if over the last 26 years that he's been in Washington, that he actually stood up for them once in a while. (Soundbite of crowd ovation) HORSLEY: Obama said he doesn't blame McCain personally for Wall Street's problems, but he does blame an economic philosophy that he says McCain subscribes to, a philosophy of lax oversight and loose regulation that rewards the wealthy while ignoring the middle class. He noted that McCain's former campaign co-chair, Phil Gramm, led the push for deregulation of the nation's banking industry when Gramm was a senator. Obama said relaxed banking rules have come back to haunt not only borrowers who can't pay their mortgages, but Wall Street lenders as well. Senator OBAMA: Now, instead of prosperity trickling down, the pain has trickled up from the struggles of hardworking Americans on Main Street to the largest firms on Wall Street. This country cannot afford four more years of this failed philosophy. (Soundbite of crowd ovation) HORSLEY: In between campaign stops yesterday, Obama was on the telephone with Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson about the turmoil on Wall Street. He also spoke with his own economic advisers, including former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker. Senator OBAMA: There's a lot of talk about how we're going to get the economy back on track and our financial institutions back on track. The last time we saw something like this was with the savings and loans crisis, and we are going to have a lot of rebuilding to do. HORSLEY: Obama drew big crowds yesterday in western and southern Colorado, two corners of this battleground state that are not its Democratic strongholds. While he was stressing the economy, running mate Joe Biden was talking campaign tactics in Michigan, criticizing McCain for a string of misleading campaign ads. Senator JOE BIDEN (Democrat, Delaware; 2008 Democratic Vice Presidential Nominee): The same campaign that once called for a town hall meeting a week is now launching a low blow a day. HORSLEY: Speaking at a high school gym outside Detroit, Biden said McCain had deliberately misrepresented Obama's record on sex education and taxes, charges that are backed-up by independent news outlets and fact-checking websites. Senator BIDEN: For every punch that's thrown at us, it's at attempt to distract you, to distract the American people, from the very important issues that face this country. (Soundbite of applause) HORSLEY: Obama meanwhile took McCain to task for billing himself and his running mate as reformers. If he and Sarah Palin are so interested in getting special interests out of Washington, Obama asked, why is McCain's campaign led by so many former lobbyists? Senator OBAMA: Lobbyists for the insurance and the oil industry, for Freddie Mac and foreign governments. And if you think those lobbyists are working day and night for John McCain just to put themselves out of work, well, let me tell you, I've got a bridge to sell you up in Alaska. (Soundbite of crowd ovation) HORSLEY: Obama joked about a new McCain campaign that even co-opts one of his own signature campaign lines, \"Change We Need.\" Surrounded by supporters holding signs with that very message, Obama said instead of borrowing my lines, McCain needs to borrow some of our ideas.

            "article_content": "Amid news of the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers and turmoil in the financial markets, Republican presidential nominee John McCain and his Democratic rival, Barack Obama, both say Wall Street's problems reflect a failure in Washington. And both promise to overhaul the rules governing financial markets. Campaigning Monday in Colorado, Obama called the current crop of economic problems another example of Main Street financial woes trickling up. For years, Wall Street eagerly financed high-risk mortgages, helping to inflate the nation's housing bubble.  Now the bubble has popped.  Many Americans can't repay their risky home loans \u2014 and Wall Street firms are stuck with gum all over their faces. \"Today offers more evidence, Colorado, that too many folks in Washington and on Wall Street weren't minding the store,\" Obama said. \"For eight years we've had policies that have shredded consumer protections, loosened oversight and regulation and encouraged outsized bonuses to CEOs while ignoring middle-class Americans.\" Obama says he doesn't blame McCain for these problems, but he does blame the economic philosophy that he says McCain subscribes to. \"It's the same philosophy we've had for the last eight years \u2014 one that says we should give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else,\" Obama said. Obama's comments today echoed remarks he made in March at New York's Cooper Union, where he criticized the banking deregulation of the late 1990s. Instead of a necessary updating of banking rules, Obama said, the government had adopted a \"winner-take-all, anything-goes environment that helped foster devastating dislocations in our economy.\" One of the leading architects of that deregulation effort was McCain's former campaign co-chairman, Phil Gramm.  As a Texas senator, Gramm helped write the law that relaxed the nation's banking rules. Then, after leaving the Senate, Gramm became an executive and lobbyist for the Swiss banking giant UBS \u2014 at a time when banks were fighting to loosen rules against predatory lending. Obama says that reliance on an unfettered free market is dangerous. \"It's a philosophy that says even common-sense regulations are unnecessary and unwise, and one that says we should just stick our heads in the sand and ignore economic problems until they spiral into crises,\" Obama said. Gramm has been one of McCain's key economic advisers, but he officially left the campaign this summer after making the impolitic comments that America was \"a nation of whiners\" and that the country was merely suffering from a \"mental recession.\" McCain himself initially seemed to downplay the severity of the economic slowdown Monday during a campaign appearance in Florida. \"Our economy, I think still, the fundamentals of our economy are strong, but these are very, very difficult times,\" McCain said. McCain's observation about strong fundamentals drew immediate fire from the Obama campaign.  Later in the afternoon, McCain was singing a different tune. \"I know Americans are hurting now. The fundamentals of our economy are at risk,\" McCain said. It's awkward for a Republican candidate to make that kind of charge during a Republican administration. But here again, McCain is hoping that he and his running mate will be seen as reformers \u2014 despite voting with President Bush nine times out of 10. \"The McCain-Palin administration will replace the outdated patchwork quilt of regulatory oversight and bring transparency and accountability to Wall Street,\" McCain said. \"We will bring transparency and accountability, and we will reform the regulatory bodies of government.\" McCain offered no details of what that overhaul would look like. But a spokesman said this is a time to update rules, not relax them, suggesting a break with Gramm. McCain also said in a written statement that he is glad the federal government isn't putting taxpayer money at risk to bail out Lehman Brothers. Although McCain endorsed the government's rescue of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac last week as necessary to prevent a financial breakdown, neither he nor the Bush administration sees Lehman's collapse as posing the same kind of systemic risk.",

            "article_content": "Sen. Barack Obama promised to double funding for charter schools and pay teachers based on performance. At an event in Riverside, Ohio, he also criticized President Bush's plan to withdraw 8,000 troops from Iraq.  MELISSA BLOCK, host: This is All Things Considered from NPR News. I'm Melissa Block. ROBERT SIEGEL, host: And I'm Robert Siegel.  We begin this hour on the campaign trail.  Both presidential hopefuls were in Ohio today trying to pick up votes in a crucial swing state this November.  Barack Obama focused on education, outlining a school reform plan that includes performance-based pay for teachers.  Obama was also critical of President Bush's announcement today that he is drawing down U.S. forces in Iraq.  NPR's Debbie Elliot reports. DEBBIE ELLIOT:  Senator Obama said the president's plan falls short and does not solve the central problem in Iraq, the need for political reconciliation. Senator BARACK OBAMA (Democrat, Illinois; 2008 Democratic Presidential Nominee):  In the absence of a timetable to remove our combat brigades, we'll continue to give Iraq's leaders a blank check instead of pressing them to reconcile their differences.  So the president's talk of return on success is a new name for continuing the same strategic mistakes that have dominated our foreign policy for over five years. ELLIOT:  Obama's comments came at a Dayton area-high school where he earlier gave what the campaign billed as a major policy speech.  He started with a shout out to the educators in the room. Senator OBAMA:  We appreciate what you do each and every day because there's no job that is more important. ELLIOT:  Obama said candidates always say education is a top priority but don't deliver.  He says the same tired debates have crippled progress and left schools and parents to fend for themselves.  And he said his opponent was part of the problem. Senator OBAMA:  John McCain doesn't get it.  He doesn't understand that our success as a nation depends on our success in education and our success in public education.  That's something I do understand. (Soundbite applause) ELLIOT:  Obama outlined an ambitious string of education proposals, more investment in early childhood education, a 4,000 dollar college tax credit for middle-class students who agree to public service, committing resources to No Child Left Behind and increasing school competition by funding charter schools.  He also tackled a thorny issue of teacher merit, promising to recruit top talent, start performance-based pay and... Senator OBAMA:  And one of the things that we are going to have to do, and this is something that I know sometimes is difficult, but teachers who are doing a poor job, they've got to get extra support.  But if they don't improve, then they have to be replaced. ELLIOT:  Some in the audience were skeptical about the teacher-pay proposal.  Marla Bell works for the Ohio Education Association. Ms. MARLA BELL (Labor Relations Consultant, Ohio Education Association):  You know, that is just so difficult to measure, to create.  We've done that, been there, and it just - it's a very difficult measure. ELLIOT:  Nonetheless, she'll vote for Obama.  And one of the biggest reasons, she says, is how Ohio's economy has suffered. Ms. BELL:  Well, you know, my husband and I have lived in Ohio our entire lives.  And our families are here.  But when our children graduate from high school, we don't know that there's a need to remain in Ohio.  It's almost - it feels like it's a dying state. ELLIOT:  Debbi Elliot, NPR News, Dayton, Ohio.

He's pushing for a Senate bill that would nullify a Supreme Court ruling that gives women a 180-day limit to file complaints about unequal pay. This year, the issue of equal pay for equal work has come up primarily because of Lilly Ledbetter, who shared her story at the Democratic National Convention last month. \"Late in my career, someone left a note in my box at work showing my pay versus three males,\" she says. \"We four were doing the exact same job, and their pay was drastically higher than mine.\" In fact, it was nearly double. That happened in 1998, the same year Ledbetter retired after two decades at the Goodyear tire plant in Gadsden, Ala. Her complaint eventually made its way to the Supreme Court. Last year, the court ruled that she needed to have filed her complaint within 180 days of when the discrimination occurred \u2014 and she had missed that deadline. The court's decision transformed Ledbetter from plaintiff to political cause. Now the Obama campaign is rallying around her case. But critics, including John McCain, say if the legislation passes, businesses will face frivolous lawsuits.",

The comments came in a campaign appearance in Duryea, Pa., a day after McCain became the GOP presidential nominee.  MELISSA BLOCK, Host: Now to the Obama campaign. Senator Obama brought up the unemployment numbers today at a visit to a glass factory outside Scranton, Pennsylvania. BARACK OBAMA: Now, you would think that George Bush and his potential Republican successor, John McCain, would be spending a lot of time worrying about the economy and all these jobs that are being lost on their watch. But if you watched the Republican National Convention over the last three days, you wouldn't know that we have the highest unemployment rate in five years, because they didn't say a thing about what is going on with the middle class. BLOCK: NPR's Audie Cornish is traveling with Barack Obama. And, Audie, did the senator offer any fixes of his own to this economic problem? AUDIE CORNISH: Senator Obama essentially said, look, I'm going to give you three concrete policies, and he went over what we've heard this week about a middle class tax cut for 95 percent of middle class families. He also talked about rebuilding infrastructure and developing green industries and talking about making college more affordable. He's got a plan to give sort of in- exchange-for-service tuition. But the idea here is Senator Obama's talking to people who are in manufacturing jobs or factories that are experiencing growth and saying, we can do more work like the kind of work you're doing if we put in a kind of broad investment in bringing jobs back. BLOCK: Audie, we saw the Republicans really come out swinging against the Obama ticket during their convention. What is the Obama campaign planning going forward? CORNISH: So far, what you're going to see from the campaign is female surrogates, women going out, speaking on behalf of Barack Obama in some key states. First up to bat is going to be Senator Hillary Clinton in Florida on Monday. You're also going to see people like Kansas Governor Kathleen Sebelius going out and campaigning on Barack Obama's behalf to sort of counter the Sarah Palin effect on the race. You won't be hearing Senator Obama mention the name of John McCain's running mate. He's going to continue to tie McCain to George Bush, although they are going to be using Palin's name when it comes to fundraising. So far, they've used the strength of her performance at the RNC to say to Democrats, look, help us out. And voters have responded with over eight million in donations to the Obama campaign since Governor Palin spoke at the convention. BLOCK: Okay, that's NPR's Audie Cornish traveling with the Obama campaign outside Scranton, Pennsylvania today. Audie, thanks so much. CORNISH: Thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2008 NPR.

            "article_content": "With Republican eyes on the convention in St. Paul, Minn., Barack Obama was in the key state of Ohio \u2014 picking up a trip through the Midwest that he had scaled back because of Hurricane Gustav. Gabrielle Nevin, a single mom and student, set the tone for the event on the Kent State University Tuscarawas campus, introducing Obama through her own story. \"I believe this man right here, Barack Obama, understands my struggle because he has seen it firsthand, as he was raised by a single mother who was juggling school and work,\" Nevin said. \"And I heard he has a plan to help women like me.\" More than 200 people \u2014 mostly women \u2014 turned out for the invitation-only event on the economy, set in a campus garden courtyard. Obama evoked the experiences of Nevin, his own mother, his grandmother and even his two daughters in drawing out his connections to issues that affect working women. \"We still have a situation where women are making 77 cents to every dollar that a man makes on the job. That's why what I've said is that when I am president of the United States, we are going to pass equal pay for equal work,\" Obama said. \"It is a simple principle. It is a basic principle. It is one we are going to make sure is in place when I am president.\" Obama followed that up with a hit list of economic platform issues, including his pledge to cut taxes for 95 percent of the middle class, and his plan to generate jobs for the economy by spending federal dollars on boosting green technology and rebuilding America's roads, bridges and other aging infrastructure. \"If people tell you we can't do it, you just remember that we are spending $10 billion a month in Iraq when the Iraqis have $79 billion in surplus that they have parked in a New York bank account and are getting interest for. I don't think that makes much sense,\" Obama said. Obama battled over women voters with Hillary Clinton in the primaries and will likely face another challenge with the introduction of Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin to the GOP ticket. Obama managed not to utter Palin's name more than twice all day, although it was clear that the Republican vice presidential nominee wasn't too far from his mind. \"People ask me, 'What have you learned about America as you have traveled through 49 states?' The one I've missed was Alaska, and I'm thinking now I should have gone up there,\" he said. Later in the day, Obama attended a barbecue across the state. He stood before hay bales and sunflowers doubled over from the heat, and he gave rural voters an earful about his rivals. \"Everybody talked about John McCain's biography,\" he said. \"But nobody talked about how are you going to make the middle class more stable and more solid, and how are you going to create jobs and how are you going to grow the economy? Nobody talked about that. And I wouldn't either, I guess, if I had the same record they had over the last eight years.\" Voters here say Obama will need to keep up those jabs if he wants to win over the state his predecessor failed to capture in the past few general elections.",

It might be surprising that a large number of Vietnamese support John McCain \u2014 a man who was shot down over Hanoi as part of the U.S. military operation during the Vietnam War. But these days, there are a lot of people who claim to have pulled John McCain from Truc Bach Lake 41 years ago. Some newly minted capitalists offer to tell their story for cash, but not Tran Van Tang. Tran insists he was the one who first reached McCain. Pointing out into the lake, Tran says he saw McCain's parachute and immediately started swimming toward it while a Vietnamese anti-aircraft battery onshore fired continuously. McCain was unconscious when he reached him, Tran says, and he grabbed McCain by the left hand \u2014 the one with a broken watch \u2014 and, with the help of others, dragged him to shore and cut the parachute away using the knife strapped to McCain's leg. Tran says the army and police then came and took McCain away. Tran says he hopes the man he helped save \u2014 the man who has visited Vietnam many times since \u2014 becomes the next U.S. president. \"He's been in the Senate for a long time, so he has experience,\" Tran says.  \"He may have come during the war to bomb us, but in the end he was saved by the Vietnamese. And if he becomes president, I think he will remember that and create more favorable conditions for Vietnam than the other candidate.\" Across town, the man who commanded the missile battery that brought down McCain's A-4 Skyhawk, Nguyen Xuan Dai, sits under a photo of himself taken with Vietnam's legendary general, Vo Nguyen Giap. The former missile battery commander, now 70, says he thinks it would be a \"beautiful thing\" if the man his crew brought down was trusted enough by voters to be elected president, but he is cautious of McCain's age. \"John McCain is now old,\" Nguyen Xuan Dai says.  \"Throughout the campaign he's done well, but he's not young. And I just wonder whether he can be elected.\" One of McCain's jailers, Nguyen Tien Tran, now lives in a small apartment not far from the infamous \"Hanoi Hilton\" where McCain and other U.S. airmen were kept and tortured repeatedly, they say, by their captors. Nguyen Tien Tran vehemently denies that John McCain or any of the others were tortured in prison, but he concedes that McCain was tough. He says he remembers going to the hospital with McCain after he was pulled from the lake with his leg and both arms broken. Nguyen Tien Tran says he doesn't care who becomes the next U.S. president \u2014 \"that's the American people's decision,\" he says. \"But the war is in the past. The U.S. and Vietnam are friends, and we see John McCain as a friend, too.\" Back at Truc Bach Lake, a dozen or so young people born after the war are drinking coffee at a lakeside cafe. \"Barack Obama doesn't have much experience in diplomacy or in foreign policy,\" says Nguyen Tien Nghi, a 27-year-old businessman. \"He's not as strong as John McCain on these issues.\" But Nguyen Tien Nghi still prefers Obama, whom he sees as a unifier and a man who appears to care more about the poor and the middle class. Nguyen's friend, 31-year-old Tuan, however, goes a step further. \"He is friendly and people oriented,\" Tuan says of Obama.  \"He seems to have a peaceful spirit and wants to unite the world \u2014 bring peace to the world, not create wars, so that's why I like Obama.\"",

Sen. Barack Obama accepted the Democratic Party's presidential nomination Thursday with \"profound gratitude and great humility.\" The historic moment was witnessed by a packed football stadium in Denver and an audience of millions watching and listening at home. Speaking for some 45 minutes, Obama said his Republican opponent, Sen. John McCain, \"doesn't get it.\" He responded to criticisms of his celebrity and outlined a list of programs he would enact, all with the soaring oratory for which he is known. Obama said the nation was at a defining moment, \"a moment when our nation is at war, our economy is in turmoil and the American promise has been threatened once more.\" He blamed \"the broken politics in Washington and the failed policies of George W. Bush. \"America, we are better than these last eight years,\" he said.  \"We are a better country than this.\" Obama thanked his rival for the nomination, New York Sen. Hillary Clinton, whom he called \"a champion for working Americans and an inspiration to my daughters and to yours.\" Obama also praised former President Bill Clinton, saying he had made the case for change Wednesday night \"as only he can make it.\" Talking Tough, Targeting McCain It was a celebratory atmosphere at Invesco Field, near downtown Denver.  Convention delegates and Obama supporters filed into the 75,000-seat stadium throughout the afternoon and sat under the sun, listening to musicians including Stevie Wonder, will.i.am and Sheryl Crowe. Volunteers signed up unregistered voters, and vendors did a brisk business in Obama T-shirts and pins. Obama was preceded to the stage by former Vice President Al Gore, who narrowly lost the 2000 race to President Bush. Gore said he knew something about close elections and said the 2000 election was close \"because defenders of the status quo are desperately afraid of the change Barack Obama represents.\" Speaking from a podium built over the football field, Obama outlined a list of proposals, answering calls for specific plans to address the ailing economy. Countering charges from the McCain camp, Obama emphasized he would \"cut taxes for 95 percent of all working families.  Because in an economy like this, the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class.\" For the sake of the economy, he said, he would \"set a clear goal as president: In 10 years, we will finally end our dependence on oil from the Middle East.\" However, he did not explain how. Much of Obama's speech was devoted to taking on his Republican opponent. He said McCain \"doesn't get it.\" Attempting to tie McCain to unpopular President George W. Bush, Obama said that next week, at the Republican convention in St. Paul, the \"same party that brought you two terms of George Bush and Dick Cheney will ask this country for a third. And we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look like the last eight.  On Nov. 4, we must stand up and say: \"Eight is enough.\" Obama served up tough talk on national security issues. He said McCain \"stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end\" what he called the \"misguided war\" in Iraq. \"If John McCain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament, and judgment, to serve as the next commander in chief,\" Obama said, \"that's a debate I'm ready to have.\" 'America, We Cannot Turn Back' The historic nature of Obama's candidacy, the first African-American to receive a major party's presidential nomination, was a theme of the night. Obama, the son of a white Kansan mother and a black Kenyan father, delivered his acceptance speech on the 45th anniversary of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s \"I Have a Dream\" speech, in which the civil rights leader outlined his vision for a colorblind society. Rep. John Lewis of Georgia, the only person still alive of those who spoke with King that day, told the crowd, \"With the nomination of Sen. Barack Obama tonight, the man who will lead the Democratic Party in its march toward the White House, we are making a down payment on the fulfillment of that dream.\" Obama referenced the \"Dream\" speech, calling King a young preacher from Georgia: \" 'We cannot walk alone,' the preacher cried. 'And as we walk, we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead. We cannot turn back.' \" \"America, we cannot turn back,\" Obama said. \"Not with so much work to be done. Not with so many children to educate, and so many veterans to care for. Not with an economy to fix and cities to rebuild and farms to save. Not with so many families to protect and so many lives to mend.  America, we cannot turn back. We cannot walk alone. At this moment, in this election, we must pledge once more to march into the future. Let us keep that promise \u2014 that American promise \u2014 and in the words of Scripture hold firmly, without wavering, to the hope that we confess.\" After the speech, Obama was joined on the podium by his wife, Michelle, his two young daughters, his running mate, Joe Biden, and Biden's family. Confetti rained down, and the sky was lit up with fireworks. The Democratic ticket will campaign over the next three days in the key swing states of Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania. McCain, meanwhile, has a rally scheduled Friday in Dayton, Ohio, in which he is expected to announce his running mate. McCain appeared in a TV ad Thursday night in which he congratulated Obama on his nomination. \"Sen. Obama, this is truly a good day for America. Too often the achievements of our opponents go unnoticed. So I wanted to stop and say, 'Congratulations,' \" McCain says in the ad. \"How perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day. Tomorrow, we'll be back at it. But tonight, senator, job well done.\"",

Barack Obama of Illinois and Joseph Biden of Delaware their 2008 presidential and vice presidential nominees, a historic ticket they hope will recapture the White House after eight years of Republican rule. It marked the first time that a major party has nominated an African-American as its presidential nominee. In an unscheduled bit of stagecraft, Obama briefly joined Biden onstage at the Pepsi Center, after the vice presidential nominee had revved the crowd up with his acceptance speech. \"I think the convention has gone pretty well so far. What do you think?\" Obama said, as delegates cheered and waved. Obama and his running mate embraced as members of Biden's family filed onto the podium. Earlier in the day, Obama officially secured his party's nomination after a dramatic, but carefully arranged show of party unity from Sen. Hillary Clinton, whom Obama narrowly defeated after a long and at times divisive primary campaign. Clinton called on the assembled delegates to unanimously support Obama by acclamation. Later, her husband, former President Bill Clinton, delivered a forceful speech of his own, asserting, \"I am here first to support Barack Obama.\" Biden's Line of Attack In his address accepting the vice presidential nomination, Biden talked about his upbringing in Pennsylvania and Delaware as the middle-class son of a car salesman. He said his father fell on hard economic times, but always told him: \"Champ, when you get knocked down, get up. Get up.\" Biden called Obama the great American success story. \"You learn a lot about a man debating him,\" Biden said of Obama, his onetime rival for the nomination. As he praised Obama, Biden also carried out the traditional running mate's role of taking on the opponent, presumptive Republican nominee John McCain. Biden called McCain, his longtime Senate colleague, a friend, and noted the Republican's sacrifice as a prisoner of war in Vietnam. But he said the challenges that the nation faces \"require more than a good soldier.\" Biden criticized McCain's foreign policy judgment on issues ranging from Iraq and Afghanistan to Georgia. \"Again and again, on the most important national security issues of our time,\" Biden said, \"John McCain was wrong, and Barack Obama was proven right.\" Historic Roll Call Biden and Obama's end-of-night appearance together capped a day filled with theatrical moments. Chief among them was Clinton's call during Wednesday's roll call of the states to give Obama the nomination by voice vote. \"Let us declare together in one voice, right here and right now, that Barack Obama is our candidate, and he will be our president,\" Clinton told the delegates on floor. It was a gesture that moved many in the convention hall to tears. Clinton's and Obama's names were both formally placed in nomination shortly after Wednesday's session of the convention began. There were nominating and seconding speeches, and then the traditional roll call of the states. As the roll call reached New Mexico, a carefully choreographed dance arranged by the Obama and Clinton camps played out.  New Mexico's delegates yielded to Illinois, Barack Obama's home state, which in turn yielded to New York. As TV cameras focused on the floor, Hillary Clinton walked through the throng and asked that the rules be suspended and Obama be nominated by acclamation. The chair of the convention, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, then asked the convention for those in favor of the motion to vote \"aye.\" A chorus of \"ayes\" rang through the hall. Pelosi then asked if there were any nays. Before anyone so inclined could respond, Pelosi banged down her gavel, settling the question. The Clintons Do Their Part That ended a delicate, drawn-out process between the Obama and Clinton camps. Clinton wanted to make sure her supporters got their due. Obama's campaign wanted to avoid divisive grumbling that it feared would hamper his efforts to win the White House in November. Wednesday's second Clinton moment came a couple of hours later, when former President Clinton addressed the convention. Answering those who say he has seemed tepid in his support for Obama, Clinton told the crowd, \"Last night, Hillary told us in no uncertain terms that she is going to do everything she can to elect Barack Obama. That makes two of us.\" Calling him the man for the job, Clinton said Obama has the intelligence and curiosity every president needs and has shown a clear grasp of foreign policy. The former president said Obama is \"ready to lead America,\" and he praised Obama's selection of Joe Biden as a running mate, saying, \"He hit it out of the park.\" Clinton made parallels between his campaign 16 years ago and Obama's, noting that in 1992, he, too, was painted as being too young and too inexperienced to occupy the Oval Office. \"It didn't work in 1992, because we were on the right side of history,\" he said. \"And it will not work in 2008, because Barack Obama is on the right side of history.\" Next Up: Obama's Big Night Obama has his own date with history Thursday night, when the convention scene shifts from the Pepsi Center to Invesco Field at Mile High, the football stadium where Obama will deliver his acceptance speech. During his brief appearance at the Pepsi Center Wednesday, Obama said the goal was \"to open up this convention to make sure that everybody who wants to come can join in the effort to take America back.\"  Some 75,000 people are expected to be in attendance. Obama's speech comes at a historic moment, the 45th anniversary of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s famous \"I Have a Dream\" speech, in which he outlined his goals for a colorblind society.  As the nation's first major party African-American presidential candidate, Obama is well aware of the parallel.  He is also doubtlessly aware of the last time a presidential nominee made an open-air acceptance speech, John F. Kennedy's address at the Los Angeles Coliseum in 1960.",

The group -- run by the firm of Rick Berman, who heads a number of industry-funded nonprofits -- is pushing a similar message as the Coalition for a Democratic Workplace. The two groups share twin goals: defeating the Employee Free Choice Act and damaging Democratic chances to pick up Senate seats. The new ads are running in Kentucky, Oregon, Maine, Mississippi and Colorado. On the other side, the union-backed American Rights At Work just launched a series of print and billboard ads promoting the legislation as a boon to a struggling middle class. Labor argues the measure would allow workers to choose a union without as much harassment from corporate management. The Service Employees International Union gave $250,000 to American Rights At Work in 2007.",

            "article_content": "Sen. Barack Obama spent the first night of the Democratic National Convention at the home of some of his supporters. Sitting on a couch in the living room of the Girardeau family in Kansas City, Mo., he watched his wife Michelle address the convention delegates. Obama then appeared before the arena crowd in Denver briefly via satellite. Kansas City was the latest stop in Obama's convention week tour of battleground states. He also had a news conference Monday on the tarmac at the Quad City Airport near Davenport, Iowa, where he made a pitch to independent voters at a town hall meeting at the local fairgrounds. He has had a lighter-than-usual schedule this week, allowing him time to rest and prepare for the convention. He told reporters outside Davenport that he had been retooling his own speech, set for Thursday night at the Denver Broncos football stadium before 75,000 people. When asked what he thinks he has to accomplish at the convention, he said he has two main goals: focusing on the choice voters have \u2014 \"I want to make the choice between myself and John McCain as clear as possible. I don't want people to be confused,\" he said \u2014 and conveying who he is. \"During the course of a 19-month campaign, I think that ... you're on the television screen, you're in big auditoriums, but sometimes who you are may get lost,\" he said. But there is another goal for this Democratic nominee. He must unite the party and erase battle lines carved out during his long primary slugfest with Sen. Hillary Clinton, who will speak Tuesday at the convention. She has urged her supporters to back Obama, but many are reluctant, and some have been openly bitter. Former President Clinton \u2014 a tough critic of Obama during the primaries \u2014 will speak Wednesday. Obama declined to preview his speech, but he did offer some clues, suggesting that he might not lean on the soaring rhetoric he sounded as keynote speaker at the Democratic convention in 2004 \u2014 the kind of speech that has been his trademark since the earliest caucuses and primaries in January. Obama said a different kind of speech is required this year. \"I think people know I can give the kind of speech that I gave four years ago; that's not the question on voters' minds,\" he said. \"I think they're much more interested in what am I going to do to help them in their lives. And so in that sense, I think this is going to be a more workman-like speech. I'm not aiming for a lot of high rhetoric; I'm much more concerned with communicating how I intend to help middle-class families live their lives.\"",

            "article_content": "The 2003 Medicare prescription drug bill had a hidden provision that's about to cause a huge political headache. If certain types of Medicare spending grow too fast, the provision calls for the administration and Congress to act to rein it in. Now, that action has been \"triggered,\" with potentially devastating \u2014 and politically unpopular \u2014 cuts coming in the middle of an election year.  MELISSA BLOCK, host: This afternoon, the Bush administration sent Congress legislation aimed at bringing down the overall cost of Medicare. But this is no routine Medicare bill. As NPR's Julie Rovner reports, it represents the first move in what could become an election-year brawl on Capitol Hill. JULIE ROVNER: Today's story actually began back in 2003, in a little notice section of the Medicare Prescription Drug Law. It was designed to force the president and Congress to take action if too much of Medicare spending was coming from general income tax revenues. Secretary MIKE LEAVITT (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services): We call it the Medicare trigger. ROVNER: That's Health and Human Services Secretary Mike Leavitt. The trigger requires the president to submit a bill to Congress to bring Medicare general tax spending back under 45 percent of the program's total. In a conference call with reporters, Leavitt acknowledged that the administration had some doubts about whether to comply with the mandate that it send up actual legislative language. Some White House advisers wondered whether that was constitutional. But in the end, Leavitt said, the desire to deal with the growing cost of Medicare won out. Sec. LEAVITT: The president feels that it's necessary and important that not only he but future presidents respond to this. And anything that can prompt, motivate, coax the Congress into dealing with this now while it's still solvable, is an important part of the law. ROVNER: The bill the administration is proposing has three parts. One would give the HHS secretary authority to impose relatively non-controversial programs aimed at getting better value for less money, things like electronic medical records. The second is a longstanding administration proposal to cap certain damages in medical malpractice lawsuits. The final piece would impose higher premiums for the prescription drug benefits for beneficiaries with higher incomes. Texas Congressman Jeb Hensarling, chairman of the conservative Republican Study Committee, says that will appeal to his wing of the party. Representative JEB HENSARLING (Republican, Texas): And the prescription drug benefit should have been geared towards those who needed it the most; those who did not have a benefit, those who are of low and moderate income. ROVNER: Democrats, however, oppose the proposal. In fact, they oppose the budget trigger in the first place. And they were quick this afternoon to call the measure dead on arrival. Part of the reason, says Richard Kogan, an economist at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, is that the trigger just calls for moving money around. It doesn't actually do anything to lower overall Medicare spending. Mr. RICHARD KOGAN (Economist, Center on Budget and Policy Priorities): It does nothing to address the fact that we have long-run budget problems including because of the rapid growth of health care costs in the society. ROVNER: In fact, he says, the way the trigger law is written makes it easy to raise regressive taxes like the Medicare payroll tax to replace progressive sources of funding like the income tax. Another thing the trigger does is make it easy to get this particular Medicare bill to the House and Senate floors. By law, the leaders of both houses must introduce the measure, and the relevant committees are required to act on it or a similar bill by specific dates this summer. And if the Democrats refuse to bring the bills to the floor, there are special provisions that make it fairly simple for the Republicans to force a debate. Hensarling says he and his conservative allies plan to do just that. Rep. HENSARLING: House conservatives would try to use every procedural tool that we have to ensure that the law, as we understand it, is followed and at least one plan that will comport with the original legislation is brought to the floor. ROVNER: But in the end, it may be moderate Republicans who could pay the price for a messy Medicare debate just weeks before election day. Democrats need only vote no on the bill. Republicans, however, may end up torn between a desire for fiscal responsibility and one of the government's most popular programs. Julie Rovner, NPR News, Washington. Copyright \u00a9 2008 NPR.

            "article_content": "In a discussion about the presidential candidates' health care plans, the starting point is the number $2 trillion. That's what the United States spends each year on health care. Plans by both Democratic Sen. Barack Obama and Republican Sen. John McCain aim to hold down costs and improve the quality of care. And both candidates propose to do so through the existing private health insurance system. The idea is that with more customers, insurers will compete for business by offering good policies and finding ways to make care more efficient and thus cheaper. But at least one health expert says that whatever savings their plans might provide won't be enough to offset rising care costs. McCain's Tax Credit McCain's approach is to provide tax credits to help people buy health insurance. The Arizona senator's economic adviser, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, says, \"It's going to be $5,000 toward every family's purchase of health insurance, something that basically would be a non-event for people already getting insurance from their employer. But for those who are buying it out of pocket, a lot of help there.\" Holtz-Eakin estimates that about 20 million to 30 million people who don't currently have insurance would buy coverage. He says the tax credit is budget-neutral from the government's point of view: It will be balanced by taxes on health insurance payments by employers. McCain has said his plan also is designed to help people who have a medical condition and can't find insurers that will cover them at a reasonable price. \"Our estimates are that that will cost about $20 billion, if you configure it along the lines of states like Minnesota that have been successful in reaching this population,\" Holtz-Eakin says. He won't project the effect on the nation's health care bill, however. Obama Looks To Employers Obama's health plan would require employers to contribute toward health insurance, a benefit that only half to two-thirds of workers now get. No one could be denied coverage. The Illinois senator's health adviser, David Cutler, says the plan would cut spending by 8 percent, though the savings could take several years. \"What we estimate is that Sen. Obama's health plan would reduce the cost of health care by about $2,500 for a typical family,\" Cutler says. \"That's a combination of direct out-of-pocket costs that the family no longer has to make and premium payments from their employers that families are now paying in the lower wages that they receive,\" he says. It also means less money paid out in taxes as the government needs less money for its own health plans, such as Medicare and Medicaid. Savings Questioned Both candidates are looking to some of the same places for cost savings. They've talked about the availability of preventive care \u2014 so that high-cost medical conditions might be avoided \u2014 and the promotion of less costly generic drugs. They also envision that the development of health information technology would not only simplify billing but prevent duplicate services and inform doctors about the best and most efficient care. Obama says he would provide government support to that end. Princeton University health economist Uwe Reinhardt says that while these initiatives might help people, there's not much evidence they'll save money. Reinhardt doesn't believe preventive care or chronic-care programs for conditions such as diabetes or high blood pressure will save money in the long run, but he says they will \"enhance quality of life\" and give people more value for the dollar. And he says health information technology is horrendously expensive to put into place and maintain. As for generic drugs, they are already widely used. The campaign officials say that taken together, the initiatives will result in a more efficient health care system. Meanwhile, polls show that interest in health care reform, once high, has slackened. Reinhardt says that if nothing changes, people will have more than health care to worry about. \"After 2025, if health care keeps growing like it has in the last 40 years, then there will actually be less money for education, roads, military, fashion, and everything else,\" he says. But by then, the problem of rising health care costs will belong to another set of candidates.",
