Bush. The law was introduced by President Lyndon Johnson in 1965 to help states level the playing field for students living and learning in poverty. Cross your fingers. Congress is trying to do something it was supposed to do back in 2007: agree on a rewrite of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. It's not controversial to say the law is in desperate need of an update. The ESEA is hugely important, not just to our nation's schools but to the social fabric. It pours billions of federal dollars each year into classrooms that serve low-income students. When President Lyndon Johnson first signed it in 1965, he declared the law \"a major new commitment of the federal government to quality and equality in the schooling that we offer our young people.\" The ESEA is supposed to be updated every few years but hasn't been rewritten since 2001, when another Texan, President George W. Bush, famously renamed it No Child Left Behind. Bush took Johnson's original vision, to help states level the playing field for students living and learning in poverty, and added teeth. \"We're gonna spend more money, more resources,\" Bush said at the time, \"but they'll be directed at methods that work. Not feel-good methods. Not sound-good methods. But methods that actually work.\" Those methods included a sweeping new federal system of testing and accountability \u2014 as strict as it was controversial. The message to states was clear: We don't trust you to do the right thing by your most disadvantaged students. Schools that fail to educate all kids should be fixed or closed. With its emphasis \u2014 obsession, critics would say \u2014 on standardized testing, the law became unpopular among many teachers and parents and technically expired in 2007. But it's on the books until it's replaced. Now, the challenge for lawmakers is figuring out what \u2014 if any \u2014 of Bush's tough-love methods worked. This week, NPR is trying to do the same. The Tough Guy President Lyndon B. Johnson signs the Elementary and Secondary Education Act in 1965 with Kate Deadrich Loney, his first schoolteacher.\n                \n                    \n                    Yoichi Okamoto/Lyndon B. Johnson Library\n                    \n                \nhide caption President Lyndon B. Johnson signs the Elementary and Secondary Education Act in 1965 with Kate Deadrich Loney, his first schoolteacher. Bush's tough-love approach was motivated by the sense that states weren't doing enough to fix their low-performing schools. NCLB created a new role for the federal government: Tough Guy. Right now, the House and Senate don't agree on much, but they do agree that the Tough Guy routine didn't work. The recent bills crafted by both chambers \u2014 and that must now be reconciled \u2014 leave it to the states to decide what to do about struggling schools. That includes how to fix them and whether or when to close them. But at least one researcher thinks the law, like the classic Tough Guy, is a little misunderstood. And that parts of the law did work. \"NCLB is usually regarded as a sledgehammer, but it's actually fairly complex and fairly nuanced,\" says Tom Ahn, who teaches at the University of Kentucky. Ahn has a Ph.D. in economics and writes papers with titles like, \"Distributional Impacts of a Local Living Wage Increase.\" In short, he's an unlikely guy to have written one of the go-to studies on NCLB. But he did. And it's an eye-opener. A few years ago, Ahn and his colleague, Jacob Vigdor, wondered: In spite of the controversy, did No Child Left Behind do some good? Did it improve low-performing schools? For answers, they studied the schools of North Carolina, though what they found can be applied just about anywhere. How It Worked Under NCLB, schools were judged on something called Adequate Yearly Progress. The goal was to get every child to grade-level in reading and math by 2014. It was an impossible goal that infuriated teachers and administrators alike because it held all children \u2014 and all schools \u2014 to the same timeline. The law didn't care if a child had begun the year three grades behind in reading and a teacher helped her make two years' worth of progress by May. According to NCLB's strict proficiency guidelines, that student was still a year below grade-level. The law also required schools to break down their student data into lots of little subgroups, including race, disability and socioeconomic status. Ahn says that was a game changer. \"If one group of disadvantaged students underperformed, the entire school was considered underperforming.\" Or, as Nancy Barbour puts it: \"Your high-fliers can't cover for your low-fliers.\" In 2002, Barbour was the principal of a very good school in Durham, N.C. She says the new law made her and lots of fellow principals and teachers nervous, thinking \"Oh no, oh no. In four years we're gonna be restructuring, and in six we're gonna be closed down.\" Some of that fear was justified. Because of the law's attention to these smaller groups of students, some of whom tended to underperform, many schools that had previously earned high marks suddenly got red flags. This is the first of two important lessons Tom Ahn learned studying NCLB. Lesson No. 1: Some Schools Didn't Need Fixing, Just Scaring \"The ones that had the capacity to shape up, they did,\" Ahn says. He found that many schools improved after that first warning with no sanctions at all \u2014 just the threat of sanctions. Because these schools had relatively few kids below grade-level and enough money and staff to focus on them. Ahn found a very different story among schools where lots of students were struggling. For these, often poorer schools, the law was like quicksand. Donna Brown is director of federal program monitoring and support for North Carolina's public schools, and she saw the quicksand firsthand. \"When I came to the department in 2004,\" Brown remembers, \"there were nine schools in the state that were identified for some level of improvement sanction. And, by 2008-9, there were 521.\" That's nearly half of all schools in the state that received federal Title I dollars. After two years of failing to make progress, a school had to offer students the right to transfer to a better school. The problem with this transfer policy, says Brown, is \"you're not really doing anything to address the needs of that school.\" It was more punishment than panacea. Schools often sank deeper into the quicksand. If they continued to fail to make Adequate Yearly Progress, they were also required to pay for tutoring services and, later, to choose from a list of \"corrective actions,\" including changing curriculum or lengthening the school day. And here begins the other great lesson of No Child Left Behind. Lesson No. 2: The Lobotomy For schools stuck in the quicksand, Ahn says, \"these sanctions start stacking up, and at the end of the day, they don't help the schools to improve.\" That is, until the last, most-feared sanction \u2014 restructuring \u2014 which Ahn likens to \"a lobotomy.\" After five years, schools \"in need of improvement\" were supposed to write a restructuring plan that could include firing teachers, reopening as a charter or handing over control to the state. And in Year 6, they were supposed to do it. In North Carolina, Ahn found the most common strategy was simply replacing the person at the top, the principal. The effect on student performance was significant, equivalent to \"reducing class size by a third to a half.\" Why did the lobotomy so often work? It's hard to say. Ahn points out that, to be forced into restructuring, a school had to be considered failing for six years. \"There's something seriously wrong with the way the school has been run,\" Ahn says. \"And, when leadership change occurs, basically there's a sea change.\" He says he could see it not only in student performance but in teacher satisfaction surveys. After the lobotomy, teachers were often happier. At least, that's what the data suggest. To really understand restructuring and why, Ahn says, it was the only sanction under NCLB that seemed to work, we need to see a lobotomy firsthand. We'll have that story later today.",

The premise is simple: Correspondents, editors and producers throughout our newsroom will share pieces that have kept them reading. They'll share tidbits on Twitter using the #NPRreads hashtag, and on occasion we'll share a longer take here on the blog. This week, we bring you four reads that illuminate a bit of history or pieces of regulation you may not have known about. From Brian Naylor, a correspondent on NPR's Washington desk: Time to end the white male dominance of US currency?  http://t.co/d1YCZcpNPV via @vauhinivara #nprreads What's in your wallet? No matter how much or little, the cash we carry has one thing in common-it's decorated with the faces of deceased white men. Two women in New York hope to change that: \"It wouldn't require a vote in Congress or Presidential approval to get a woman on the twenty-dollar bill. The Secretary of the Treasury is responsible for the designs that appear on paper notes, including the portraits. Nor do the people depicted on bills have to meet particularly stringent standards; according to U.S. law, they just have to be dead.\" From Chuck Holmes, NPR's deputy managing editor: Looking back at America's 1st suicide bombing ... in 1891 ... on Wall Street. #NPRreads http://t.co/mLNxcmrHpa There's something oddly fascinating about a suicide bombing in New York's Gilded Age. This historical piece is full of great details like this: the bomber, blown literally to bits, was identified by a Brooks Brothers suspender button found at the scene. A horrible, 21st Century-style crime in a quaint and simpler time. From Carline Watson, the executive producer of NPR's identity and culture unit: Over the years, black people have been \"colored,\" \"black,\" \"negroes,\" \"African-American\" and many derogatory and pejorative names in-between that I won't mention here. And it is no secret that there are some first names that immediately signify that the bearer is black, which, it is believed, can sometimes work to a person's disadvantage. In the continuing quest for who decides what black people call themselves, a recent story by Professor Brittney Cooper of Rutgers University caught my eye. She wrote: A new study from professor Erika Hall of Emory University's Goizueta Business School suggests that white people have a far more negative view of the term \"Black\" than they do of the term \"African-American.\" For instance, study participants routinely concluded that a person had a higher level of education and job status, if that person was referred to as African-American rather than Black...... Study participants also concluded that targets identified as \"African-American\" were perceived to have a higher socioeconomic status, to generally be more competent, and to have a \"warmer\" personality. Cooper points out that this debate is not new. Early in the 20th century, W.E.B. DuBois wrote in The Souls of Black Folk, about the double-consciousness of being black, \"this sense of always looking at ones' self through the eyes of others, of measuring one's soul by the tape of a world that looks on in amused contempt and pity. One ever feels his two-ness, An American, a Negro; two souls, two thoughts, two unreconciled strivings; two warring ideals in one dark body, whose dogged strength alone keeps it from being torn asunder.\" From Serri Graslie, a producer on NPR's All Things Considered: Lead here is solid gold: Inside the Powerful Lobby Fighting for Your Right to Eat Pizza http://t.co/NBotFAWqe6 #nprreads The lead to this story totally drew me in: \"There are 11,781 registered lobbyists in Washington, more than enough to represent even the most arcane special interests. The American Racing Pigeon Union has a lobbying firm to work on its behalf. So do the Interlocking Concrete Pavement Institute, the Owners of Ivory Miniatures, and the International Natural Sausage Casing Association. Within corporate America, food industry lobbyists represent particularly specific interests: Groups advocate for restaurants and frozen foods, franchise associations, and chains. Beef, dairy, corn, potatoes, and apples all have their champions. \"But there is nothing quite like the pizza lobby, a rare coalition of competitors who have banded together to advocate for a specific dish. There's no sandwich lobby, no burrito trade association. The macaroni-and-cheese people have yet to get their act together.\" The rather humorous story by Bloomberg's Andrew Martin traces the birth and and influence of the pizza lobby, known as the \"American Pizza Community.\" The lobby was formed in 2010, when new federal school lunch standards put pizza on the \"nutritional axis of evil\" (schools serve almost $500 million worth of pizza each year.) Growing menu-labeling requirements also don't sit well with the pizza industry, because it knows that no one wants to see 10,000 calories listed for the large pepperoni they were about to order. When it comes to politics the pizza industry tends to prefer Republicans, giving $1.3 million to federal candidates in the last two election cycles.",

Vice President Joe Biden's speech to Yale University graduates two weeks ago is taking on new meaning after his office announced Saturday that his son Beau died after battling brain cancer. In the May speech, highlighted Sunday by the Washington Post, Biden spoke about Beau, the importance of family, compassion and building real relationships with people who disagree with you. \"It's not all that difficult, folks, to be compassionate when you've been the beneficiary of compassion in your lowest moments ... because when you know how much it meant to you, you know how much it mattered,\" Biden said. \"It's not hard to be compassionate.\" The key to being successful and happy, he told graduates, is balancing ambition with perspective. \"It's about being engaged,\" Biden said. \"It's about being there for a friend or a colleague when they're injured or in an accident, remembering the birthdays, congratulating them on their marriage, celebrating the birth of their child. It's about being available to them when they're going through personal loss. It's about loving someone more than yourself.\" Speaking about an earlier car accident that claimed the life of his wife and infant daughter, and seriously injured Beau and his brother Hunter, Biden told graduates to keep in mind that \"things can change in a heartbeat. I know.\" He said by focusing on his young sons during that time, \"I found my redemption.\" \"The incredible bond I have with my children is the gift I'm not sure I would have had, had I not been through what I went through,\" he said. Beau also spoke about his father being there for him after that fatal 1972 accident. He was introducing his father in 2008 at the Democratic National Convention, and said his dad was always at his side during that time, \"My brother and I, not the Senate, were all that he cared about ... he said then Delaware can get another senator but my boys can't get another father.\" Here is Joe Biden's full speech from May 17, courtesy of the White House: Yale UniversityNew Haven, Conn. THE VICE PRESIDENT: Hello, Yale! (Applause.) Great to see you all. (Applause.) Thank you very, very much. Jeremy and Kiki, the entire Class of 2015, congratulations and thank you for inviting me to be part of this special day. You're talented. You've worked hard, and you've earned this day. Mr. President, faculty, staff, it's an honor to be here with all of you. My wife teaches full-time. I want you to know that \u2014 at a community college, and has attended 8,640 commencements and/or the similar versions of Class Day, and I know they can hardly wait for the speaker to finish. (Laughter.) But I'll do my best as quickly as I can. To the parents, grandparents, siblings, family members, the Class of 2015 \u2014 congratulations. I know how proud you must be. But, the Class of 2015, before I speak to you \u2014 please stand and applaud the ones who loved you no matter what you're wearing on your head and who really made this day happen. (Laughter and applause.) I promise you all this is a bigger day for them than it is for you. (Laughter.) When President Obama asked me to be his Vice President, I said I only had two conditions: One, I wouldn't wear any funny hats, even on Class Day. (Laughter.) And two, I wouldn't change my brand. (Applause.) Now, look, I realize no one ever doubts I mean what I say, the problem occasionally is I say all that I mean. (Laughter.) I have a bad reputation for being straight. Sometimes an inappropriate times. (Laughter.) So here it goes. Let's get a couple things straight right off the bat: Corvettes are better than Porsches; they're quicker and they corner as well. (Laughter and applause.) And sorry, guys, a cappella is not better than rock and roll. (Laughter and applause.) And your pundits are better than Washington pundits, although I've noticed neither has any shame at all. (Laughter and applause.) And all roads lead to Toads? Give me a break. (Laughter and applause.) You ever tried it on Monday night? (Laughter.) Look, it's tough to end a great men's basketball and football season. One touchdown away from beating Harvard this year for the first time since 2006 \u2014 so close to something you've wanted for eight years. I can only imagine how you feel. (Laughter.) I can only imagine. (Applause.) So close. So close. But I got to be honest with you, when the invitation came, I was flattered, but it caused a little bit of a problem in my extended family. It forced me to face some hard truths. My son, Beau, the attorney general of Delaware, my daughter, Ashley Biden, runs a nonprofit for criminal justice in the state, they both went to Penn. My two nieces graduated from Harvard, one an all-American. All of them think my being here was a very bad idea. (Laughter.) On the other hand, my other son, Hunter, who heads the World Food Program USA, graduated from Yale Law School. (Applause.) Now, he thought it's a great idea. But then again, law graduates always think all of their ideas are great ideas. (Laughter.) By the way, I've had a lot of law graduates from Yale work for me. That's not too far from the truth. But anyway, look, the truth of the matter is that I have a lot of staff that are Yale graduates, several are with me today. They thought it was a great idea that I speak here. As a matter of fact, my former national security advisor, Jake Sullivan, who is teaching here at Yale Law School, trained in international relations at Yale College, edited the Yale Daily News, and graduated from Harvard \u2014 excuse me, Freudian slip \u2014 Yale Law School. (Laughter.) You're lucky to have him. He's a brilliant and decent and honorable man. And I miss him. And we miss him as my national security advisor. But he's not the only one. My deputy national security advisor, Jeff Prescott, started and ran the China Law Center at Yale Law School. My Middle East policy advisor and foreign policy speechwriter, Dan Benaim, who is with me, took Daily Themes \u2014 got a B. (Laughter.) Now you know why I go off script so much. (Laughter and applause.) Look, at a Gridiron Dinner not long ago, the President said, I \u2014 the President \u2014 \"I am learning to speak without a teleprompter, Joe is learning to speak with one.\" (Laughter.) But if you looked at my speechwriters, you know why. And the granddaughter of one of my dearest friends in life \u2014 a former Holocaust survivor, a former foreign policy advisor, a former Chairman of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, Congressman Tom Lantos \u2014 is graduating today. Mercina, congratulations, kiddo. (Applause.) Where are you? You are the sixth \u2014 she's the sixth sibling in her immediate family to graduate from Yale. Six out of 11, that's not a bad batting average. (Laughter.) I believe it's a modern day record for the number of kids who went to Yale from a single family. And, Mercina, I know that your mom, Little Annette is here. I don't know where you are, Annette. But Annette was part of the first class of freshman women admitted to Yale University. (Applause.) And her grandmother, Annette, is also a Holocaust survivor, an amazing woman; and both I'm sure wherever they are, beaming today. And I know one more thing, Mercina, your father and grandfather are looking down, cheering you on. I'm so happy to be here on your day and all of your day. It's good to know there's one Yalie who is happy I'm being here \u2014 be here, at least one. (Laughter.) On \"Overheard at Yale,\" on the Facebook page, one student reported another student saying: I had a dream that I was Vice President and was with the President, and we did the disco funk dance to convince the Congress to restart the government. (Laughter.) Another student commented, Y'all know Biden would be hilarious, get funky. (Laughter.) Well, my granddaughter, Finnegan Biden, whose dad went here, is with me today. When she saw that on the speech, I was on the plane, Air Force Two coming up, she said, Pop, it would take a lot more than you and the President doing the disco funk dance. The Tea Party doesn't even know what it is. (Laughter.) Look, I don't know about that. But I'm just glad there's someone \u2014 just someone \u2014 who dreams of being Vice President. (Laughter and applause.) Just somebody. I never had that dream. (Laughter.) For the press out there, that's a joke. Actually, being Vice President to Barack Obama has been truly a great honor. We both enjoy getting out of the White House to talk to folks in the real America \u2014 the kind who know what it means to struggle, to work hard, to shop at Kiko Milano. (Laughter and applause.) Great choice. (Laughter.) I just hope to hell the same people responsible for Kiko's aren't in charge of naming the two new residential colleges. (Laughter and applause.) Now, look, folks, I spent a lot of time thinking about what I should day to you today, but the more I thought about it, I thought that any Class Day speech is likely to be redundant. You already heard from Jessie J at Spring Fling. (Laughter.) So what in the hell could I possibly say. (Laughter.) Look, I'm deeply honored that Jeremy and Kiki selected me. I don't know how the hell you trusted them to do that. (Laughter.) I hope you agree with their choice. Actually I hope by the end of this speech, they agree with their choice. (Laughter.) In their flattering invitation letter, they asked me to bring along a sense of humor, speak about my commitment to public service and family, talk about resiliency, compassion, and leadership in a changing world. Petty tall order. (Laughter.) I probably already flunked the first part of the test. But with the rest let me say upfront, and I mean this sincerely, there's nothing particularly unique about me. With regard to resilience and compassion, there are countless thousands of people, maybe some in the audience, who've suffered through personal losses similar to mine or much worse with much less support to help them get through it and much less reason to want to get through it. It's not all that difficult, folks, to be compassionate when you've been the beneficiary of compassion in your lowest moments not only from your family, but from your friends and total strangers. Because when you know how much it meant to you, you know how much it mattered. It's not hard to be compassionate. I was raised by a tough, compassionate Irish lady named Catherine Eugenia Finnegan Biden. And she taught all of her children that, but for the grace of God, there go you \u2014 but for the grace of God, there go you. And a father who lived his motto that, family was the beginning, the middle, and the end. And like many of you and your parents, I was fortunate. I learned early on what I wanted to do, what fulfilled me the most, what made me happy \u2014 my family, my faith, and being engaged in the public affairs that gripped my generation and being inspired by a young President named Kennedy \u2014 civil rights, the environment, trying to end an incredibly useless and divisive war, Vietnam. The truth is, though, that neither I, nor anyone else, can tell you what will make you happy, help you find success. You each have different comfort levels. Everyone has different goals and aspirations. But one thing I've observed, one thing I know, an expression my dad would use often, is real. He used to say, it's a lucky man or woman gets up in the morning \u2014 and I mean this sincerely. It was one of his expressions. It's a lucky man or woman gets up in the morning, puts both feet on the floor, knows what they're about to do, and thinks it still matters. I've been lucky. And my wish for all of you is that not only tomorrow, but 20 and 40 and 50 years from now, you've found that sweet spot, that thing that allows you to get up in the morning, put both feet on the floor, go out and pursue what you love, and think it still matters. Some of you will go to Silicon Valley and make great contributions to empower individuals and societies and maybe even design a life-changing app, like how to unsubscribe to Obama for America email list \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 the biggest \"pan-list\" of all times. Some of you will go to Wall Street and big Wall Street law firms, government and activism, Peace Corps, Teach for America. You'll become doctors, researchers, journalists, artists, actors, musicians. Two of you \u2014 one of whom was one of my former interns in the White House, Sam Cohen, and Andrew Heymann \u2014 will be commissioned in the United States Navy. Congratulations, gentlemen. We're proud of you. (Applause.) But all of you have one thing in common you will all seek to find that sweet spot that satisfies your ambition and success and happiness. I've met an awful lot of people in my career. And I've noticed one thing, those who are the most successful and the happiest \u2014 whether they're working on Wall Street or Main Street, as a doctor or nurse, or as a lawyer, or a social worker, I've made certain basic observation about the ones who from my observation wherever they were in the world were able to find that sweet spot between success and happiness. Those who balance life and career, who find purpose and fulfillment, and where ambition leads them. There's no silver bullet, no single formula, no reductive list. But they all seem to understand that happiness and success result from an accumulation of thousands of little things built on character, all of which have certain common features in my observation. First, the most successful and happiest people I've known understand that a good life at its core is about being personal. It's about being engaged. It's about being there for a friend or a colleague when they're injured or in an accident, remembering the birthdays, congratulating them on their marriage, celebrating the birth of their child. It's about being available to them when they're going through personal loss. It's about loving someone more than yourself, as one of your speakers have already mentioned. It all seems to get down to being personal. That's the stuff that fosters relationships. It's the only way to breed trust in everything you do in your life. Let me give you an example. After only four months in the United States Senate, as a 30-year-old kid, I was walking through the Senate floor to go to a meeting with Majority Leader Mike Mansfield. And I witnessed another newly elected senator, the extremely conservative Jesse Helms, excoriating Ted Kennedy and Bob Dole for promoting the precursor of the Americans with Disabilities Act. But I had to see the Leader, so I kept walking. When I walked into Mansfield's office, I must have looked as angry as I was. He was in his late 70s, lived to be 100. And he looked at me, he said, what's bothering you, Joe? I said, that guy, Helms, he has no social redeeming value. He doesn't care \u2014 I really mean it \u2014 I was angry. He doesn't care about people in need. He has a disregard for the disabled. Majority Leader Mansfield then proceeded to tell me that three years earlier, Jesse and Dot Helms, sitting in their living room in early December before Christmas, reading an ad in the Raleigh Observer, the picture of a young man, 14-years-old with braces on his legs up to both hips, saying, all I want is someone to love me and adopt me. He looked at me and he said, and they adopted him, Joe. I felt like a fool. He then went on to say, Joe, it's always appropriate to question another man's judgment, but never appropriate to question his motives because you simply don't know his motives. It happened early in my career fortunately. From that moment on, I tried to look past the caricatures of my colleagues and try to see the whole person. Never once have I questioned another man's or woman's motive. And something started to change. If you notice, every time there's a crisis in the Congress the last eight years, I get sent to the Hill to deal with it. It's because every one of those men and women up there \u2014 whether they like me or not \u2014 know that I don't judge them for what I think they're thinking. Because when you question a man's motive, when you say they're acting out of greed, they're in the pocket of an interest group, et cetera, it's awful hard to reach consensus. It's awful hard having to reach across the table and shake hands. No matter how bitterly you disagree, though, it is always possible if you question judgment and not motive. Senator Helms and I continued to have profound political differences, but early on we both became the most powerful members of the Senate running the Foreign Relations Committee, as Chairmen and Ranking Members. But something happened, the mutual defensiveness began to dissipate. And as a result, we began to be able to work together in the interests of the country. And as Chairman and Ranking Member, we passed some of the most significant legislation passed in the last 40 years. All of which he opposed \u2014 from paying tens of millions of dollars in arrearages to an institution, he despised, the United Nations \u2014 he was part of the so-called \"black helicopter\" crowd; to passing the chemical weapons treaty, constantly referring to, \"we've never lost a war, and we've never won a treaty,\" which he vehemently opposed. But we were able to do these things not because he changed his mind, but because in this new relationship to maintain it is required to play fair, to be straight. The cheap shots ended. And the chicanery to keep from having to being able to vote ended \u2014 even though he knew I had the votes. After that, we went on as he began to look at the other side of things and do some great things together that he supported like PEPFAR -\u2014 which by the way, George W. Bush deserves an overwhelming amount of credit for, by the way, which provided treatment and prevention HIV/AIDS in Africa and around the world, literally saving millions of lives. So one piece of advice is try to look beyond the caricature of the person with whom you have to work. Resist the temptation to ascribe motive, because you really don't know -\u2014 and it gets in the way of being able to reach a consensus on things that matter to you and to many other people. Resist the temptation of your generation to let \"network\" become a verb that saps the personal away, that blinds you to the person right in front of you, blinds you to their hopes, their fears, and their burdens. Build real relationships \u2014 even with people with whom you vehemently disagree. You'll not only be happier. You will be more successful. The second thing I've noticed is that although you know no one is better than you, every other persons is equal to you and deserves to be treated with dignity and respect. I've worked with eight Presidents, hundreds of Senators. I've met every major world leader literally in the last 40 years. And I've had scores of talented people work for me. And here's what I've observed: Regardless of their academic or social backgrounds, those who had the most success and who were most respected and therefore able to get the most done were the ones who never confused academic credentials and societal sophistication with gravitas and judgment. Don't forget about what doesn't come from this prestigious diploma \u2014 the heart to know what's meaningful and what's ephemeral; and the head to know the difference between knowledge and judgment. But even if you get these things right, I've observed that most people who are successful and happy remembered a third thing: Reality has a way of intruding. I got elected in a very improbable year. Richard Nixon won my state overwhelmingly. George McGovern was at the top of the ticket. I got elected as the second-youngest man in the history of the United States to be elected, the stuff that provides and fuels raw ambition. And if you're not careful, it fuels a sense of inevitability that seeps in. But be careful. Things can change in a heartbeat. I know. And so do many of your parents. Six weeks after my election, my whole world was altered forever. While I was in Washington hiring staff, I got a phone call. My wife and three children were Christmas shopping, a tractor trailer broadsided them and killed my wife and killed my daughter. And they weren't sure that my sons would live. Many people have gone through things like that. But because I had the incredible good fortune of an extended family, grounded in love and loyalty, imbued with a sense of obligation imparted to each of us, I not only got help. But by focusing on my sons, I found my redemption. I can remember my mother \u2014 a sweet lady \u2014 looking at me, after we left the hospital, and saying, Joey, out of everything terrible that happens to you, something good will come if you look hard enough for it. She was right. The incredible bond I have with my children is the gift I'm not sure I would have had, had I not been through what I went through. Who knows whether I would have been able to appreciate at that moment in my life, the heady moment in my life, what my first obligation was. So I began to commute \u2014 never intending to stay in Washington. And that's the God's truth. I was supposed to be sworn in with everyone else that year in '73, but I wouldn't go down. So Mansfield thought I'd change my mind and not come, and he sent up the secretary of the Senate to swear me in, in the hospital room with my children. And I began to commute thinking I was only going to stay a little while \u2014 four hours a day, every day \u2014 from Washington to Wilmington, which I've done for over 37 years. I did it because I wanted to be able to kiss them goodnight and kiss them in the morning the next day. No, \"Ozzie and Harriet\" breakfast or great familial thing, just climb in bed with them. Because I came to realize that a child can hold an important thought, something they want to say to their mom and dad, maybe for 12 or 24 hours, and then it's gone. And when it's gone, it's gone. And it all adds up. But looking back on it, the truth be told, the real reason I went home every night was that I needed my children more than they needed me. Some at the time wrote and suggested that Biden can't be a serious national figure. If he was, he'd stay in Washington more, attend to more important events. It's obvious he's not serious. He goes home after the last vote. But I realized I didn't miss a thing. Ambition is really important. You need it. And I certainly have never lacked in having ambition. But ambition without perspective can be a killer. I know a lot of you already understand this. Some of you really had to struggle to get here. And some of you have had to struggle to stay here. And some of your families made enormous sacrifices for this great privilege. And many of you faced your own crises, some unimaginable. But the truth is all of you will go through something like this. You'll wrestle with these kinds of choices every day. But I'm here to tell you, you can find the balance between ambition and happiness, what will make you really feel fulfilled. And along the way, it helps a great deal if you can resist the temptation to rationalize. My chief of staff for over 25 years, one of the finest men I've ever known, even though he graduated from Penn, and subsequently became a senator from the state of Delaware, Senator Ted Kaufman, every new hire, that we'd hire, the last thing he'd tell them was, and remember never underestimate the ability of the human mind to rationalize. Never underestimate the ability of the human mind to rationalize \u2014 her birthday really doesn't matter that much to her, and this business trip is just a great opportunity; this won't be his last game, and besides, I'd have to take the redeye to get back. We can always take this family vacation another time. There's plenty of time. For your generation, there's an incredible amount of pressure on all of you to succeed, particularly now that you have accomplished so much. You're whole generation faces this pressure. I see it in my grandchildren who are honors students at other Ivy universities right now. You race to do what others think is right in high school. You raced through the bloodsport of college admissions. You raced through Yale for the next big thing. And all along, some of you compare yourself to the success of your peers on Facebook, Instagram, Linked-In, Twitter. Today, some of you may have found that you slipped into the self-referential bubble that validates certain choices. And the bubble expands once you leave this campus, the pressures and anxiousness, as well \u2014 take this job, make that much money, live in this place, hang out with people like you, take no real risks and have no real impact, while getting paid for the false sense of both. But resist that temptation to rationalize what others view is the right choice for you -\u2014 instead of what you feel in your gut is the right choice \u2014- that's your North Star. Trust it. Follow it. You're an incredible group of young women and men. And that's not hyperbole. You're an incredible group. Let me conclude with this. I'm not going to moralize about to whom much is given, much is expected, because most of you have made of yourself much more than what you've been given. But now you are in a privileged position. You're part of an exceptional generation and doors will open to you that will not open to others. My Yale Law School grad son graduated very well from Yale Law School. My other son out of loyalty to his deceased mother decided to go to Syracuse Law School from Penn. They're a year and a day apart in their age. The one who graduated from Yale had doors open to him, the lowest salary offered back in the early '90s was $50,000 more than a federal judge made. My other son, it was a struggle \u2014 equally as bright, went on to be elected one of the youngest attorney generals in the history of the state of Delaware, the most popular public official in my state. Big headline after the 2012 election, \"Biden Most Popular Man in Delaware \u2014 Beau.\" (Laughter.) And as your parents will understand, my dad's definition of success is when you look at your son and daughter and realize they turned out better than you, and they did. But you'll have opportunities. Make the most of them and follow your heart. You have the intellectual horsepower to make things better in the world around you. You're also part of the most tolerant generation in history. I got roundly criticized because I could not remain quiet anymore about gay marriage. The one thing I was certain of is all of your generation was way beyond that point. (Applause.) Here's something else I observed \u2014 intellectual horsepower and tolerance alone does not make a generation great: unless you can break out of the bubble of your own making \u2014 technologically, geographically, racially, and socioeconomically \u2014 to truly connect with the world around you. Because it matters. No matter what your material success or personal circumstance, it matters. You can't breathe fresh air or protect your children from a changing climate no matter what you make. If your sister is the victim of domestic violence, you are violated. If your brother can't marry the man he loves, you are lessened. And if your best friend has to worry about being racially profiled, you live in a circumstance not worthy of us. (Applause.) It matters. So be successful. I sincerely hope some of you become millionaires and billionaires. I mean that. But engage the world around you because you will be more successful and happier. And you can absolutely succeed in life without sacrificing your ideals or your commitments to others and family. I'm confident that you can do that, and I'm confident that this generation will do it more than any other. Look to your left, as they say, and look to your right. And remember how foolish the people next to you look \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 in those ridiculous hats. (Laughter.) That's what I want you to remember. I mean this. Because it means you've learned something from a great tradition. It means you're willing to look foolish, you're willing to run the risk of looking foolish in the service of what matters to you. And if you remember that, because some of the things your heart will tell you to do, will make you among your peers look foolish, or not smart, or not sophisticated. But we'll all be better for people of your consequence to do it. That's what I want you to most remember. Not who spoke at the day you all assembled on this mall. You're a remarkable class. I sure don't remember who the hell was my commencement speaker. (Laughter.) I know this is not officially commencement. But ask your parents when you leave here, who spoke at your commencement? It's a commencement speaker aversion of a commencement speaker's fate to be forgotten. The question is only how quickly. But you're the best in your generation. And that is not hyperbole. And you're part of a remarkable generation. And, you \u2014 you're on the cusp of some of the most astonishing breakthroughs in the history of mankind \u2014 scientific, technological, socially \u2014 that's going to change the way you live and the whole world works. But it will be up to you in this changing world to translate those unprecedented capabilities into a greater measure of happiness and meaning \u2014 not just for yourself, but for the world around you. And I feel more confident for my children and grandchildren knowing that the men and women who graduate here today, here and across the country, will be in their midst. That's the honest truth. That's the God's truth. That's my word as a Biden. Congratulations, Class of 2015. And may God bless you and may God protect our troops. Thank you. END3:37 P.M. EDT",

One of the first issues he'll confront is how far to take his pledge to roll back parts of the state's Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act. One of the first issues Matt Bevin will confront as the new governor of Kentucky is how far to take his pledge to roll back parts of the state's Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act. The effects could be particularly dramatic in places such as Jackson County, one of the poorest counties in Kentucky. Half of the population of 13,000 is on Medicaid, the state and national program that provides health care insurance to low-income Americans. According to Census figures, 34 percent of Jackson County's residents live below the poverty line, compared to almost 19 percent of the population statewide. But even as many in the county depend on government help to access health care, residents overwhelmingly voted for Bevin, a Republican who called the state's expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, \"unsustainable\" and \"unaffordable\" and has vowed to dismantle Kentucky's health insurance exchange. Among those on Medicaid in Jackson County is Angel Strong, an unemployed nurse in McKee, Ky. \u2014 one of roughly half a million Kentuckians who received health insurance after outgoing Gov. Steve Beshear, a Democrat, embraced the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion. Kentucky saw one of the sharpest declines in the rate of uninsured adults. \"I had never had Medicaid, because I had insurance at my job,\" said Strong. \"Now I am out of a job and I am looking for another job, but in the meantime I had no income.\" Religious beliefs \"outweigh\" having health insurance Bevin's lack of support for expanded Medicaid didn't faze Strong, who voted for Bevin because she supported his socially conservative stands against gay marriage and abortion. \"My religious beliefs outweigh whether or not I have insurance,\" Strong said. Most Jackson County residents are in Strong's shoes and need some kind of financial help to get health insurance coverage, said Doug Justice, who helps locals sign up for insurance. \"I do have some who are subsidized,\" he explained. \"They get some help there but the majority of [my cases are] Medicaid. A lot of it is. And it's helped a lot of people.\" Justice said many in Jackson County did not have the future of Medicaid in their state in mind when they went into the voting booth last month. \"They are not getting into the details of that either,\" Justice said. \"Maybe because they don't understand the ramifications of that should it happen, or they're just thinking, 'I'll deal with it when it takes place.'\" Shane Gabbard, a county administrator and a local pastor, was also not surprised that Medicaid didn't play a bigger role in this year's election. \"I don't think that people were really worried about the health care swing of it because it wasn't a hot topic here,\" Gabbard said. Tough love In Jackson County, the lack jobs and other day-to-day issues related to poverty loom larger than health care, Gabbard said. \"Unfortunately we don't have a lot of factories here right now. We are working on that \u2014 trying to get some industry going,\" said Gabbard. \"We don't have a movie theater. We don't have a skating rink. We don't have a bowling alley. We don't have nothing.\" If Bevin does try to reduce Kentucky's Medicaid rolls, he'll get plenty of support from Strong, who said tough love might be good for some people in Jackson County as she was getting a haircut around the corner from the public library where Justice was signing up people for health insurance. Strong, and her hair stylist, Stephanie Wilson, both voted for Bevin because they believe too many people in Jackson County rely on the government. \"They want everything they can get for free,\" Strong said. \"They think somebody owes it to them \u2014 just because,\" chimed in Wilson. \"Nobody owes you anything. You earn what you get.\" With a nursing background, Strong said she plans on finding a new job soon so that she can leave Medicaid. Both women are optimistic Bevin, a former businessman, will improve the economy in their corner of the state \u2014 which has yet to catch a break.",

The area is active for smugglers bringing their product north from Mexico into the United States. This week, NPR examines public corruption in South Texas. The FBI has launched a task force to clean up pervasive misconduct by public servants in the Rio Grande Valley. But as NPR's John Burnett and Marisa Penaloza report, the problems are entrenched. The Rio Grande Valley of Texas is a world apart, isolated by empty ranch land to the north, the Gulf to the east, and Mexico to the south. A million-and-a-half people live there amid dazzling wealth and stark poverty. \"Corruption's always been an issue here in the Valley. It has always been the compadre system: You scratch my back, I'll scratch yours, so to speak.\" Carlos Gomez But federal authorities say \"the Valley\" is steeped in corruption of every stripe: drug smuggling, vote stealing, courthouse bribery, under-the-table payoffs and health care fraud. Late last year, the feds launched the Rio Grande Valley Public Corruption Task Force to clean up South Texas. It's housed in the FBI building, a three-story, bunker-like edifice in an office park across the street from public housing in McAllen, Texas. \"The public's perception is that the problem is inordinately grave and that it is worse here than other places,\" says FBI supervisory special agent Rock Stone. \"We're being very vocal and very public about the fact that [public corruption] is wrong, it is immoral, and you're betraying the public's trust.\" Rock Stone \u2014 that's his actual name \u2014 looks the part: 6 foot 3 inches, buff, career FBI agent and son of a cop. He says the task force has five times the number of investigators compared with years past, including Texas Rangers and agents of the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Homeland Security. Since his office opened its doors last November, they've gotten a steady stream of tips from the public about corrupt officials. \"And we're going to pursue all of these people: school board, city, county, state, judicial, executive, legislative. We're going to pursue them and we're going to lock them up,\" Stone says. The Justice Department created its newest anti-corruption task force as a result of the continuing numbers of big and little fish getting nabbed down on the border. In 2013, more public officials were convicted of federal crimes in South Texas \u2014 83 of them \u2014 than in any other region of the country. Jonathan Trevi\u00f1o shows seized contraband.

The former police narcotics squad leader is currently serving 17 years in prison for reselling narcotics back to drug dealers. In the past two decades, no fewer than five sheriffs have been busted for corruption. And from 2000 to 2013, 13 U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents went to prison. \"I was a cop who went drug dealer. That's what it is,\" says Jonathan Trevi\u00f1o, a former police narcotics squad leader who is serving 17 years in a federal penitentiary. Last year, his entire unit went to prison for seizing dope and selling it back to traffickers in Hidalgo County. \"No one forced us. No one held a gun to our heads. No one threatened the families, saying, 'You better participate in illegal activity.' No, we all decided to abuse our position,\" he said in an interview inside the prison. Jonathan Trevi\u00f1o's father, Lupe, who was Hidalgo County's powerful and popular sheriff, is serving a five-year prison term for a separate conviction. He admitted taking $10,000 in illegal campaign contributions from a drug trafficker known as The Rooster, with ties to the Gulf Cartel. Corruption also reaches into local elections. Five campaign workers, known as politiqueras, pleaded guilty to election fraud in Hidalgo County in a case involving votes bought with cash, beer and cocaine. In a separate case in neighboring Cameron County, nine politiqueras have been charged with manipulating mail-in ballots. \"A politiquera will get a person's vote by simply taking the ballot and filling it out themselves, or they will instruct the voter: 'Go ahead and mark your ballot right here.' And they don't even know who they are voting for,\" says Mary Helen Flores, founder of Citizens Against Voter Abuse, which is trying to reform Valley elections. The Rio Grande Valley is known in law enforcement circles as a \"high-temptation environment.\" Al Alvarez figures he has represented more indicted politicians than any other lawyer in the Valley. He sips a beer after work at a tavern in the Hidalgo County seat of Edinburg. \"Look,\" he says, \"border cities are complex. The Valley is complex.\" It's certainly complex economically. In the tip of Texas, there's a Maserati and a Jaguar dealership. Yet a third of the population lives below the poverty line and receives food stamps. For years, this tropical river delta was known mainly for ruby red grapefruit, snowbirds and unauthorized immigrants. Today, the Rio Grande Valley is booming with new construction of bank branches, hospital complexes and luxury homes. Where does all the money come from? \"You know, there is an underground economy,\" Alvarez says, lowering his voice. \"Drugs fuel 20 percent of the economy here in the Valley.\" His estimate that a fifth of the local economy floats in drug money may be high. There's a lot of legitimate money in circulation from agribusiness, hospitals, rich Mexicans who have relocated here, and the big state and federal border security payrolls. But there's no denying that the local economy benefits from the existence of the Gulf Cartel headquartered in Matamoros, just across the river from Brownsville, even as the cartel's proximity also contributes to drug crimes, kidnappings and homicides in the region. The Valley is a major trans-shipment zone for marijuana, cocaine and methamphetamines destined for northern cities. And there's a brisk local market for cheap narcotics in the Valley. \"There is a lot of dirty money in the Rio Grande Valley,\" says Chad Richardson, emeritus sociologist at the University of Texas Pan American in Edinburg. He estimates that 5 to 10 percent of the Valley economy is rooted in illegal activity, primarily drugs. Richardson co-wrote a book about the underground economy of the South Texas borderlands that did not endear him to the chambers of commerce. \"And that money is available to corrupt public officials, including officers at the border, including sheriffs, including judges,\" he says. On a soft, muggy night, some friends have gathered on the porch of a graceful old home in West Brownsville. They are talking about corruption in the Valley. Ruth Wagner, a retired college instructor, says corruption and contraband have been a feature of the border going back to Civil War times, when confederate cotton was smuggled through Mexican ports to avoid Union blockades. \"It was cotton, it's arms, it's people, it's drugs,\" she says. \"It's something that's gone on forever because it's a part of a border culture.\" In the 27 years Wagner has been in the Valley, she has noticed the frequent images of public servants being led away in handcuffs. \"I think the FBI is down here more. I think the bigger guys are just getting caught. I think there's more of a focus on what's going on on the border right now,\" she says. Her friend, Carlos Gomez, is not so sure. \"They'll clean up for a while, and then it'll just fall back into order because that's just the way things are. Nobody's ever really done anything long term about this,\" says Gomez, a Valley native and a social worker. \"Corruption's always been an issue here in the Valley,\" he continues. \"It has always been the compadre system: You scratch my back, I'll scratch yours.\" Maybe things are starting to change in small ways.

SpaceX is breaking ground on a commercial spaceport east of Brownsville, and the University of Texas is building a major new medical school in the Valley. \"We're here to plant the flag and show that it all ends now,\" says the FBI's Rock Stone. \"I don't want to hear anymore, 'It's always been that way.' Well, it's not going to be that way anymore on my watch. I plan to be an instrument of change.\" It's too early to say how much of a change the Rio Grande Valley Public Corruption Task Force has made. Stone says they're working a large volume of cases covertly. \"You'll know we're coming after you,\" he adds, \"when we show up with an arrest warrant.\" Next in our series: John Burnett and Marisa Pe\u00f1aloza talk more with Jonathan Trevi\u00f1o.

There are many ways to describe Bernie Sanders: a democratic socialist, an independent senator, a Democratic presidential candidate. But the best adjective may just be: consistent. No matter how you label it, Sanders' worldview is locked in. Over 40 years, Sanders has built his political career on a very focused message about what he calls a \"rigged economy.\" Now he's running for president, which typically means reacting to what's happening in the world, in real time. But even in the wake of terrorist attacks by ISIS, Sanders' primary focus is still where it's been since the 1970s. The \"1 percent\" On the advantages enjoyed by the richest Americans, over the years, the numbers Sanders cites have changed. But the intensity and message have not. Income inequality It's a theme that runs through every speech Sanders gives. And over the course of a decade, the way he describes the \"unfair distribution of wealth\" has changed very little. In a 2005 speech on the House floor and 10 years later at his campaign kickoff rally in Burlington, Vt., this past spring, he delivered essentially the same line. Voter turnout Listening to speeches and debate performances going back to 1976, another theme emerges: his concern with voter turnout. Sanders attributes this to politicians not talking about the real issues facing the working people of America, kowtowing to corporate interests instead of helping the poor and middle class get ahead. Their needs and struggles have been a near single-minded focus of Sanders since his earliest days in politics. \"His concerns have always been about families and their economic problems, and when people say that Bernie is consistent, that is what he's consistent about,\" said Huck Gutman, one of Sanders' oldest friends from Vermont. Gutman spoke about his friend in a wide-ranging interview earlier this year, as Sanders prepared to kick off his campaign. And Gutman said the laser focus isn't just there when the cameras are rolling. \"When we talk, that's what he talks about all the time,\" said Gutman. Asked if he ever tries to change the subject to something like sports, Gutman said it doesn't work. \"I bring up things sometimes. It doesn't stay there very long,\" said Gutman. \"Bernie and I go for walks every weekend. We have long talks. And it's always about economics and politics.\" The question now is whether this consistency, this focus, is an asset or a problem for Sanders' candidacy. His supporters say that's one of the things they love about him. They don't want him to get distracted by the latest news. Sanders held an event this week in a Baltimore neighborhood where riots broke out in April. His press secretary asked reporters to keep the questions to the issues the senator was there to discuss \u2014 poverty, unemployment and the criminal justice system. \"Don't ask about ISIS today,\" said Symone Sanders, the campaign's press secretary. So, as the press conference was wrapping up, a reporter asked Bernie Sanders if there was a reason he didn't want to talk about ISIS. Sanders scoffed. \"What I have said is that obviously ISIS and terrorism are a huge national issue that we've got to address, but so is poverty, so is unemployment, so is education, so is health care,\" said Sanders. \"So is the need to protect working families. And I will, I will continue to talk about those issues.\" That's what he's always done. Whether that continues to work for his presidential campaign depends on whether voters' top concern remains the economy or if it is displaced by fear of terrorism and ISIS.",

In an interview with Iowa Public Radio, she discussed the minimum wage, oil pipelines and the future of the Affordable Care Act.\n                \n                    \n                    Charlie Neibergall/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton visits the Iowa State Fair on Saturday. In an interview with Iowa Public Radio, she discussed the minimum wage, oil pipelines and the future of the Affordable Care Act. Continuing to keep an eye on the general election, Hillary Clinton would not endorse a $15 minimum wage like her Democratic rivals for the presidential nomination in an interview with Iowa Public Radio. She also would not rule out approving controversial oil pipelines in a Clinton administration, if she were to become president. (You can hear her full interview with Iowa Public Radio here.) She also addressed the controversy surrounding her use of a private email server while secretary of state. \"It would have been probably smarter not to\" have used a private server, she said. Despite Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., appearing to gain on the presumed Democratic front-runner in key states, Clinton told Iowa Public Radio's Clay Masters she would support a Senate proposal to raise the minimum wage to $12 an hour, far above the current wage of $7.25 but not as far as the $15 wage backed by rivals Sanders or former Gov. Martin O'Malley, D-Md. She said she supported efforts in high-cost cities to raise the wage higher but added of raising the federal wage, \"I don't think that is in any way enough to deal with the income stagnation that we face in our country.\" Clinton said she did not see political risk in the move. \"No, I think it's a recognition of the reality of the economy in different parts of the country,\" Clinton said. \"And I think it's important to get the federal minimum wage up, but to appreciate the differences in cost of living and job markets in other places.\" Clinton's comments in Iowa, where she addressed Democratic activists in Clear Lake on Friday and attended the state fair in Des Moines on Saturday, were firmer than what she offered last month after meeting with labor leaders in Silver Spring, Md. Then, she said the $12 proposal by Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., was more realistic than the $15-an-hour plans proposed by Sanders and O'Malley. \"Let's get behind a proposal that actually has a chance of succeeding,\" Clinton said then. Clinton was also asked if she would support building oil pipelines. While she said she leaned toward states coming up with clean energy plans, she would not completely rule out pipelines. \"I'm not saying 'No,' but I'm saying my heavy bias is in favor of moving away from fossil fuels, however they are delivered,\" said Clinton, whose State Department was evaluating the Keystone XL pipeline from Canada to the U.S. She has not taken a position on the pipeline and whether she would approve it as president if President Obama does not. \"I mean, if it's not a pipeline, it's going to be railroad cars or it's gonna be trucks, and so it's not like the pipeline's the only way it can be delivered. And we should ask the bigger question, 'How can we move more quickly to a clean energy future?' \" Clinton again defended her use of a private email server as secretary of state, contending, \"I did what other secretaries of state have done.\" She also again pledged to fight for Obamacare, though she said prescription drug prices and deductibles are too high. \"We have work still to do on the Affordable Care Act,\" she said. \"No. 1, I have to defend it. Obviously if a Republican were, heaven forbid, to be elected president, it would be repealed; they've all promised it. And if the Congress stays Republican, we would be starting all over again. And I have the scars to show from how hard it is to get to where President Obama and the Congress brought us.\" Clinton declined to take shots at her Democratic rivals, saying she was more concerned with Republicans. \"I think it's great that we're having such a vigorous Democratic primary,\" she said, \"and I think what we're talking about and the issues that we're focused on are so different than what's being talked about on the other side. So I'm now really concerned about the Republican debate.\" Below is the full transcript: Clay Masters, Iowa Public Radio: So you've been spending a lot of time in Iowa recently, making a lot of weekend trips. Tell me what are two to three words that you would use to describe Iowa? Hillary Clinton, Democratic presidential candidate: Open, committed, and beautiful. CM: Plain and simple? HC: Yea, absolutely. CM: You mention your education policy. You introduced some policy regarding higher education affordability. A big discussion in Iowa right now are some recent vetoes of $56 million that Gov. [Terry] Branstad instituted for K-12 education. You've been critical of the governor's action. As you see it, what's he messed up here? HC: Well I have been critical because I know how difficult it is for a legislature \u2014 one body controlled by Republicans, the other body controlled by Democrats \u2014 ever to reach a consensus, and in this case, on two very important issues to the people of Iowa \u2014 funding education and providing mental health services. The Legislature reached such an agreement and sent a bill to the governor to deal with both of those issues. Unfortunately, the governor vetoed them. And in particular, the funding of education had been a big issue throughout this whole legislative session; I heard about it from the first trip I made to Iowa in April. And people were expecting if the Legislature reached agreement, they could make plans. School districts were looking at what they needed to do with material, equipment, teacher salaries and contracts. And then when it was vetoed, that was a very unfortunate decision by the governor. Both because the Legislature had believed and a lot of people had relied on their belief, that once they reached agreement, they would see this through. I think it said a lot about some of the priorities and values that the Republican administration here in Iowa has. CM: So you've talked a lot about pre-K, you've talked a lot about college affordability, there's a big gap in between those two time periods in a child's life that are pretty important. What needs to be done with K-12 funding, when we look at No Child Left Behind, which not very many people love, there's a lot of debate over Common Core, what would a policy from you to get K-12 funding, K-12 education back on track? HC: Well, I think that the federal government has a couple of very important roles to play. First, with special education, which is an increasing part of the budget of a lot of school districts. When special ed became the law of the land and children with disabilities were to be mainstreamed into classrooms, the federal government promised to pick up 40 percent of the cost. So far as I remember, the feds have picked up no more than 17 or 18 percent of the cost. I have as a senator, I would as a president, work to get that number up. We made a commitment which we have never fulfilled. Secondly, I think the federal government has an important role in trying to help low-income students do better, help poor districts be more competitive, and that was the original idea behind the Elementary [and] Secondary Education Act back in the 1960s, that there would be money from the [federal] government that would provide more equity; I think we've kinda gotten off track on that. And there are, in many places in the country, and even in a few places in Iowa, urban and rural districts that are unable to really meet the many needs that their kids bring to school. And then finally, I'm a big believer in looking at what works, and we have reams of educational research, but instead of really zeroing in about what is it we should do in partnership, the federal, state, local governments and school districts working with families and parents and communities, for the betterment of a student's education, we kind of go from fad to fad and I think we ought to take a hard look about what works and there should be incentives for doing more of what works and let's stop some of these faddish ideas of the moment that don't really hold up under scrutiny. CM: Another big topic in the state, moving a little bit to environmental issues, there's a company that wants to build a crude oil pipeline from the Bakken Shale in North Dakota through Iowa. Of course there's the Keystone XL pipeline, which you've said you're not weighing in on at this point. We're in a state, you pull the lens back, we're in a state that almost 30 percent of its energy comes from wind. The Iowa Corn Growers Association says almost 50 percent of the corn grown here goes to ethanol. Does it make sense to be building more oil pipelines when you and many other Democrats talk about moving more to clean energy? HC: I think that's one of the questions we should be debating in this campaign, because I want to see us put our resources and our political will behind clean renewable energy. And every time we deviate from that, we fall behind in what we're capable of doing. I support the president's clean power plan and I would like to see us begin a transition away from fossil fuels. Now, the specifics of that are important, because some parts of the country are better able to make that transition than others. I would argue Iowa is better positioned to make that transition. You're at 30 percent on wind; you're beginning to do more investments in advanced biofuels for a number of advanced power uses. When I visited the new bus station in Des Moines, you're using solar. And you're also getting economic benefit because you're using old factories and plants to manufacture turbines and other technology that can be used for clean energy. So I would like to say, as president, to every state, \"Let's have a clean energy plan, don't be citing pipelines, don't be citing anything having to do with coal or fossil fuel, until you've really looked at both the economic and the environmental necessity.\" CM: So you're not saying, \"No new pipelines\"? HC: I'm not saying \"No,\" but I'm saying my heavy bias is in favor of moving away from fossil fuels, however they are delivered. I mean, if it's not a pipeline, it's going to be railroad cars or it's gonna be trucks, and so it's not like the pipeline's the only way it can be delivered. And we should ask the bigger question, \"How can we move more quickly to a clean energy future?\" CM: Your biggest opponent in this race right now is Bernie Sanders. He's gone after you on a couple issues, trade, Keystone XL pipeline, just to name a couple. When do you start taking him [on]? HC: I think it's great that we're having such a vigorous Democratic primary, and I think what we're talking about and the issues that we're focused on are so different than what's being talked about on the other side. So I'm now really concerned about the Republican debate. I mean, you could watch that debate the other night, 17 candidates all together for four hours. You didn't hear much about college affordability or debt, you didn't hear much about what we were going to do to get incomes rising again, because they only have one solution \u2014 cut taxes on the wealthy and get out of the way of corporations \u2014 which doesn't work. So I'm really focused on laying out my policies and explaining them and drawing the contrast with Republicans. CM: At the same time too, this is a swing state, you're going to have to excite voters for, what, another 16 months here. I've talked to some Iowa, some Iowans, some Democrats who have said that they're not excited to caucus, or that they've said that they've signed up to volunteer for you but they're saying, \"Eh, I'm not going to do it right now.\" Some people have talked to me about trust issues because of the email fiasco. How do you keep people engaged? HC: Well first, let me say on trust, I don't like reading that obviously. But I am absolutely confident that by the time the caucuses roll around on Feb. 1, Democratic and independent voters here in Iowa are going to know that when it comes to fighting for them, standing up for them and their families, being on the front lines on the issues that matter to them economically, especially how to get incomes rising, that I'm the person who is not only on their side, but can actually deliver results. Y'know, we're in the middle of August, there's a lot of other things to do besides get really revved up about politics, but we have an enormous volunteer base, I get reports every day of the number of people signing up, they're making phone calls, they're canvassing, they're hosting organizing parties. We have a dedicated supporter in every precinct in Iowa. Look, anecdotal evidence doesn't really cut it with me; I want to know what the data shows, what the facts are, and the facts are pretty clear that we're building a really strong organization in Iowa that I think is going to do really well on Feb. 1. CM: Is there another shoe to drop with the email fiasco? HC: No, no, look, I understand why people are confused about this, it's a very confusing issue. I think there's just a couple things that people need to know, which is, I did what other secretaries of state have done. I was permitted to and used a personal email and, obviously in retrospect, given all the concerns that have been raised, it would have been probably smarter not to. But I never sent nor received any classified email, nothing marked \"Classified.\" And I think this will all sort itself out. And in a way, it's kind of a interesting insight into how the government operates. Because if I had not asked for my emails all to be made public, none of this would have been in the public arena. But I want people to know what we did, I'm proud of the four years I was secretary of state. So I know this is all just going to work itself out as we go forward. CM: Another big issue in the state seems to be almost every year, a minimum wage bill comes up in the statehouse. Sen. Sanders supports a $15-an-hour wage. These bills come up year after year; they don't go anywhere. You've discussed the value of cities and states setting it. What should the federal standard be for the minimum wage? HC: I support the bill introduced by my good friend and former colleague, Sen. Patty Murray from Washington, and sponsored in the House by Congressman Bobby Scott from Virginia, setting the federal minimum wage at $12. But I also strongly support cities and states looking at their own particular circumstances. The cost of living in New York is not the same as it is in Little Rock, Ark. And therefore, I supported a $15 minimum wage in New York City. And similarly, Los Angeles has just voted for a $15 wage, but I don't think that is in any way enough to deal with the income stagnation that we face in our country. So let's raise the federal minimum wage \u2014 I supported that when I was a senator \u2014 let's encourage cities and states to see what more they can do, and let's remember that two-thirds of all minimum wage workers are women, many of whom are single moms raising their kids. So this is an economic issue, it's a fairness issue, it's an economic justice issue and it's a women's issue. CM: So would you endorse a lower federal minimum wage than your Democratic opponents \u2014 HC: No, I support the $12. I support the $12 that is in the bill that Sen. Murray and Congressman Scott have introduced. I think it's a good floor and that would mean that Iowa would have to go up. And I strongly support cities and localities, even states, that want to raise it beyond $12. CM: Do you think there's a political risk in endorsing a lower minimum wage than some of your opponents support? HC: No, I think it's a recognition of the reality of the economy in different parts of the country. And I think it's important to get the federal minimum wage up, but to appreciate the differences in cost of living and job markets in other places. So Seattle, LA, New York, places like that where there's a big job market, there's a lot of opportunities for new entrants into the workforce, going to $15 makes sense economically. But there are lots of places in other parts of the country where that would not. So let's get to $12, that's going to be hard enough with a Republican Congress, and let's encourage more states to look at themselves and see what more they could do to try to make it possible for people who work full time and are paid minimum wage to actually bring home enough pay to support themselves and their family. It should not be in America that when you work full time you are still mired in poverty. That's wrong. I want to encourage work. I want to get back to the basic bargain, where, in America, if you work hard and you do your part, you should be able to get ahead and stay ahead. And the minimum wage is that: it's minimum. And we should be layering on top of it. And we should keep the pressure on a lot of big employers, who, in my view, have not moved fast enough to increase wages for all their workers. So I think we have some real opportunity ahead of us and it's a big part of my agenda. CM: We have time for one more? You gained the support, the endorsement of Sen. Tom Harkin, former Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa, he talks a lot about, or has, at that final Steak Fry, he said, \"The Affordable Care Act: Hillary Clinton's fingerprints are all over that.\" In a Clinton administration what would be next for the Affordable Care Act? HC: Well, first of all, I am so honored and delighted to have Tom Harkin's endorsement; he's a friend, he was my colleague for the eight years I was in the Senate, and to have him give me his seal of approval and talk about the common commitment we have to social and economic justice, just means the world to me. And I agree with him completely. We have work still to do on the Affordable Care Act. No. 1, I have to defend it. Obviously if a Republican were, heaven forbid, to be elected president, it would be repealed; they've all promised it. And if the Congress stays Republican, we would be starting all over again. And I have the scars to show from how hard it is to get to where President Obama and the Congress brought us. I do think it can be improved and I'm looking at ways to do that. For example, I think the cost of drugs is way too hard for so many people to afford. These high prices are putting necessary drugs out of the reach of a lot of people. I think the deductibles are too high in many of the policies and the out-of-pocket costs are too high. So we're going to be looking at how we defend the Affordable Care Act but how we go to the next level, to make sure its promise is fulfilled. And I'm excited about that, because I'm thrilled that we have 16 million Americans that finally have health care that didn't have it before. I just want to make sure it's affordable for everybody. CM: All right, Secretary Clinton, thanks for taking the time to talk with us today. HC: My pleasure. Good to talk to you. Thanks.",

            "article_content": "Argentines voted Sunday in what they are calling the vote of the generation. This is Argentina's first run-off presidential election between two well-known candidates.  MICHEL MARTIN, HOST: More politics now, this time in Argentina. Argentines voted today in the country's first-ever runoff presidential election. Two candidates are facing off in this second round of voting. We're expecting to hear the results soon, as the polls have closed for the day. And at stake is the leadership of the country with Latin America's third-largest economy. NPR's South America correspondent Lourdes Garcia-Navarro will tell us more. Hi, Lulu. LOURDES GARCIA-NAVARRO: Hi there. MARTIN: So do you want to tell us about what neighborhood you're in and what people are saying? GARCIA-NAVARRO: Yeah, I'm in Buenos Aires. It's a really lovely, almost summer day here. And we've been seeing people going to the polling stations all day. The sitting president, Cristina Kirchner, she just cast her vote. And she did not stay quiet. She spoke for almost half an hour to the press, calling it a historic election which was made possible by her government's economic and political policies - so of course, campaigning to the last - even though she is not up for re-election. Her chosen successor who's running today is behind in the polls, and the people I spoke to who are going to vote for the opposition and the right-of-center candidate say they want change. MARTIN: Tell us a little bit more about her. She has a favorite candidate in the race, so tell us a little bit about him, and then tell us about the frontrunner. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Yeah. Daniel Scioli is the anointed successor of Cristina Kirchner. He's former governor of the province of Buenos Aires. He's promising continuity with Kirchner's policies. And that means, you know, social spending, spending on programs that have targeted the poor. But the fight right now is between people who want change or continuity. The right-of-center candidate is Mauricio Macri. He's the son of a wealthy construction magnate. He's the former president of a famous soccer club here. He cut his political teeth as the mayor of Buenos Aires. So what makes his candidacy so electrifying for many is that he comes from sort of outside the political ideology of Peronism. And that's been the sort of overwhelming philosophy in Argentina since the 1940s. And this really could mean that we will see some profound political changes if he wins. MARTIN: So talk a little bit more about that. People are calling this - and you mentioned that the current president - the outgoing president - is noting how important this election is. People have been calling it the most important vote in a generation. Why is that? GARCIA-NAVARRO: Yeah. You know, the Kirchners - Christina and her late husband Nestor - have been these overwhelming powers in politics in Argentina for the last twelve years. They even have sort of a movement named after them - Kirchnerism. They call her Queen Cristina here. She is just this sort of larger-than-life figure. And we now see opposition politicians in many key political positions inside Argentina for the first time in a long time, and they are right of center. So if the right of center takes the presidency, we're going to see some drastic changes, say analysts. You have to remember Argentina's economy is in trouble right now. People really remember only 15 years ago, there was a big economic crisis that plunged 60 percent of the population into poverty, so there's a lot at stake. And people are really, really concerned about the future of Argentina. And so there is a real sense that the vote matters because these two candidates represent two very different paths for the country. MARTIN: Before we let you go, one assumes then that there are implications for U.S. policy. Can you talk a little bit about that? GARCIA-NAVARRO: Yeah. I mean, you know, Argentina under Cristina Kirchner has not had a good relationship with the United States. She's been a vocal critic. And Mauricio Macri - the right-of-center candidate who might win - he's already said that he's going to be taking a lot harder line against Venezuela and its leftist leadership, for example. And analysts say he will be a much better ally of the United States. MARTIN: That's NPR's Lourdes Garcia-Navarro in Buenos Aires. Thank you. GARCIA-NAVARRO: You're welcome.

Keam was the first Asian-American immigrant elected to the Virginia Legislature.\n                \n                    \n                    Tracy A Woodward/The Washington Post via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Mark Keam (left) is sworn in as a freshman delegate to the Virginia General Assembly in 2010 in Richmond, Va. Keam was the first Asian-American immigrant elected to the Virginia Legislature. During the past half-century, 59 million immigrants have moved to the United States, making it the No. 1 immigrant destination on the planet. Much of the influx is a result of the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act, which opened America's doors to all nationalities on a roughly equal basis and ended the infamous national origins quota system, under which immigrants from Northern and Western Europe were heavily advantaged, and people from Asia, Africa and the Middle East were mostly shut out. The people who moved here after the 1965 act made the United States a truly multicultural nation. The immigrant inflow has altered the U.S. labor market, reshaped the political landscape and prompted new consideration of what it actually means to be American, given how the country's European character is diminishing in relative importance. By 2015, immigrants constituted about 14 percent of the U.S. population, a level not seen since the major immigrant inflows of the early 20th century. An Asian-American Politician Few places in the United States have felt the impact of immigration as dramatically as Fairfax County in Virginia, on the edge of the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area. In 1970, less than 3 percent of the county population was foreign-born. By 2010, the immigrant share had risen to nearly 30 percent, and immigrants were playing prominent roles in the county's civic and private institutions. The county was partially represented in the Virginia House of Delegates by an immigrant from South Korea, Mark Keam, the first Asian-American immigrant elected to the Legislature in its 400-year history. Keam moved with his parents to the United States at age 14, settling first in Southern California. After graduating from law school, Keam moved to the D.C. area and became involved in politics, inspired by Jesse Jackson's vision of a \"Rainbow Coalition\" of immigrants, minorities and other marginalized constituencies. A young Mark Keam with his political hero, the Rev. Jesse Jackson, when Jackson visited the Democratic National Committee headquarters during his 1988 bid for the presidency.\n                \n                    \n                    Keam Family Collection/Simon & Schuster\n                    \n                \nhide caption A young Mark Keam with his political hero, the Rev. Jesse Jackson, when Jackson visited the Democratic National Committee headquarters during his 1988 bid for the presidency. Keam married Alex Seong, a Korean immigrant like himself, though one who was raised in a more insular environment. \"We ate Korean food all the time, watched Korean TV, did everything Korean, spoke Korean,\" she says. Her parents \u2014 who worked for low wages in a chicken processing plant in southern Maryland \u2014 hadn't encouraged Alex and her three brothers to think of America as their home. But the man she married had a different view. He said Korean-Americans had every right to be involved, to compete for office and represent their people. And Alex's father was impressed. \"When he met Mark and saw what good he could do for our community and for America, he just really was proud, and he really wanted to support him ... (to) go as far as he could,\" she says. But just how far is that? Immigrants compete with other workers, sometimes other minorities, for jobs and resources. Keam witnessed the 1992 riots in Los Angeles, when many Korean-owned stores were destroyed in a frenzy of rioting and looting in Latino, African-American and Asian neighborhoods. The riots have been a formative experience for Keam. \"It was from helplessly watching fellow minorities rise up against us,\" he wrote in a commentary a decade later, \"that Korean Americans finally learned the value of building bridges with others in America.\" Keam launched his own political career in 2009 and was elected that year to the Virginia Legislature, gaining strong support from the burgeoning Asian-American population in Fairfax County. He has been re-elected twice and now sees himself as representing a broader constituency, including immigrants of other nationalities, whom he sees as sharing a common bond. \"They made a decision, individually or as families, that their lives back home were too miserable for them to endure,\" Keam says. \"All of us, we came here for that one mission, which is we want to have a free life and a better life than where we came from.\" When he first ran for office, Keam's opponent in his party primary was another immigrant, Esam Omeish, a Muslim from Libya with his own exceptional story. A Lay Muslim Preacher In every period of high immigration to the United States, some group has encountered prejudice and hostility. In the 18th century, Irish immigrants were scorned. In later years, Jews and Italians were marginalized. In the 21st century, after the Sept. 11 attacks, Muslim immigrants found themselves under suspicion. At the Dar Al-Hijrah mosque in northern Virginia, the Friday sermons often touch on conditions faced by American Muslims, especially when they are led by Omeish, a surgeon at a nearby hospital and frequent guest preacher at the mosque. Dr. Esam Omeish, chief of general surgery at Alexandria Inova Hospital in Alexandria, Va., emigrated from Libya as a child. Now, he is a political activist and prominent lay leader of the U.S. Muslim community.\n                \n                    \n                    Omeish Family Collection/Simon & Schuster\n                    \n                \nhide caption Dr. Esam Omeish, chief of general surgery at Alexandria Inova Hospital in Alexandria, Va., emigrated from Libya as a child. Now, he is a political activist and prominent lay leader of the U.S. Muslim community. \"In this season of elections,\" Omeish noted during a recent service, \"bigotry and hatred for Islam has become rampant.\" Without naming names, he alluded to the arrest of a 14-year-old Muslim youth from Texas who was arrested after bringing a homemade clock to school that his teachers mistook for a bomb, and he cited Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump for failing to rebuke a voter who said Muslims are \"a problem in this country.\" But Omeish, who immigrated to America at age 15 from Libya and became a naturalized U.S. citizen, chose not to criticize his adopted country. Instead, he said it was up to the Muslim community to defend themselves against calumny. \"It will take us, the Muslims in America, to be the ones that stand for what Islam stands for,\" he said. Though working long hours as a general surgeon, Omeish has long been active in civic and political affairs in Fairfax County. When he ran against Keam in 2009, he emphasized his commitment to American values. \"The main reason why I love America more than anything else and consider it to be home, for me and for my children, is not just because I've lived here for as long as I have,\" he says. \"It's more because it nurtures what I believe defines me as an individual, which is my Islam.\" This mainly Christian country nurtures his Islam, Omeish argues, because it allows people to pursue their own identities. Omeish started U.S. high school speaking barely any English but graduated on time, with high honors. He thanks his teachers and credits his principal for supporting his push for a Muslim student group. After high school he went to Georgetown University, a Jesuit school, where one of his first courses was called \"The Problem of God.\" \"I'm like, 'What the heck?'\" he recalls. \"And the professor was a Jesuit who was very much questioning his own faith.\" It was that support for free thinking that sold Omeish on America. The woman he married is also a devout Muslim, also from Libya. Their two daughters, now in college, are also observant, also free thinkers. Omeish points out that in America his daughters have the freedom to express their opinions; that's not the case in many other countries. In his recent sermon at Dar Al-Hijrah, Omeish complains about candidates who say bad things about Islam, but argues that such comments are not so much anti-Muslim as anti-American. \"It's not just what we worry about as a community. It is about fundamentally what this country is. We're proud Americans,\" he tells his fellow worshippers, \"who understand what America is about.\" Mark Keam and his wife, Alex, are both lawyers, with successful professional careers. Esam Omeish is a general surgeon. His wife, Badria, has a Ph.D. in molecular biology and teaches at a local community college. All are leaders in their immigrant communities. But in the 1980s \u2014 when Keam and Omeish arrived in the United States \u2014 most immigrants had a high school education or less, and many lived in poverty. A Persevering Family Alvaro Alarcon works as a gang prevention counselor at Northern Virginia Family Service, a social service agency in Fairfax County that served the low-income immigrant community. His own experience growing up in a gang-plagued Fairfax County neighborhood enables him to relate to his clients. Alvaro arrived in the U.S. with his parents from Bolivia when he was 5, and for several years his family struggled in ways that are familiar to many immigrant families. His father, Victor, and mother, Rhina, decided to leave Bolivia in the early 1980s during a period of hyperinflation, when people often stood in line for hours to buy bread and milk. Rhina's sister lived in northern Virginia; except for her, the Alarcon family had no connections in America. Victor Alarcon Sr. smokes a cigar with his three sons Alvaro (left), Victor Jr. and Miguel. The elder Alarcon emigrated from Bolivia in the 1980s.\n                \n                    \n                    Alarcon Family Collection/Simon & Schuster\n                    \n                \nhide caption Victor Alarcon Sr. smokes a cigar with his three sons Alvaro (left), Victor Jr. and Miguel. The elder Alarcon emigrated from Bolivia in the 1980s. \"We decided to change our lives, change everything, leave everything behind,\" says Victor. He came first, alone, and moved in with his with sister-in-law and her husband. \"I worked every day, often for pennies,\" he recalls. When Rhina joined him, they looked for a place of their own, despite having almost no savings. Good fortune came when Victor ran into a childhood friend from Bolivia who offered a corner of the small apartment he shared with his wife. \"It was maybe 4 feet to 10 feet,\" Victor recalls, \"just a little place to put a bed and nothing else. But ... my friend opened his house to us when we most needed it.\" Rhina remained miserable, largely because she had left her two sons behind with her mother when she joined Victor in the U.S. \"Whenever we sat down to eat, every single time, she was crying,\" Victor says. \"[She said] 'I think about my kids, all the time.'\" Years later, as a counselor, their son Alvaro would find that family separation is a major reason for adjustment problems in immigrant communities; overcrowding is another. The Alarcon experience in the United States was not atypical. The family nevertheless persevered. Learning English was a chore, but they kept at it. They badgered school administrators to make sure their sons got the attention they needed. Rhina worked as a housekeeper in a nursing home. Victor learned new skills, turning to an American institution: the public library. \"For me the library was a second house,\" Victor says. \"Everything that I needed to learn about anything, I [found in] the library. I learned to fix cars, any at all. I can do anything in the house \u2014 electrical, A/C, plumbing, water heating.\" Victor worked hard at a series of jobs in restaurants and retail, and he and Rhina bought a house and made sure their boys got an education. Theirs is not a rags-to-riches story, but they were upwardly mobile, and they identified with the American experience. Alvaro, their second-born, says he picked up more than academic skills from his upbringing in Fairfax County, where three out of 10 residents are foreign-born and his classmates come from the Middle East, Asia and other Central American countries. \"I've gotten to experience not only new languages and new cultures, but new foods, new ways of thinking that I probably wouldn't have been exposed to if I'd stayed in Bolivia,\" he says. Alvaro now identifies himself as an American, but hyphenated \u2014 a \"Latino-American.\" In high school, his closest friends were a boy from Pakistan and a boy from South Korea. Between them, they share a new identity, even with their own languages and cultures. \"It's Latino-American, Pakistani-American, Korean-American,\" he explains. \"That's what we have in connection, the American part. But we have this little thing extra that makes us individuals.\"",

Hillary Clinton is wrapping up what's been a difficult summer for her campaign with a memory of a standout moment in her political career. In Portsmouth, N.H., this weekend, Clinton recalled a \"special anniversary\" \u2013 her speech on Sept. 5, 1995 to the United Nations World Conference on Women in Beijing, China. Hillary Clinton addresses the United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing on Sept. 5, 1995. \"If there is one message that echoes forth from this conference, let it be that human rights are women's rights, and women's rights are human rights, once and for all,\" Clinton famously said 20 years ago in a speech confronting Chinese leaders over their poor record on women's rights. Clinton talked about poverty, violence, and lack of access to health care. Marking the occasion Saturday in New Hampshire, Clinton echoed that message from 1995 \u2014 and linked it with issues she's been stressing on the campaign trail in 2015. \"What's good for women is good for America,\" she said, adding that equal pay, childcare, and family leave are not just women's issues, but economic ones. \"Too often these are called women's issues,\" Clinton said. \"If you can't afford to go to work or find a safe place to leave your kids, you're not gonna have the kind of economic opportunity you deserve.\" Clinton said men also have a stake in such policies, pointing out that many men are now caring for children and aging parents. The speech allowed Clinton to showcase one of her strong suits, at a time when she needs to energize her base - which includes a significant share of female voters. Clinton's campaign continues to be dogged by questions about her private email server during her time as Secretary of State. In the past week, she's dealt with a new release of emails in response to an open records request, and the news that one of her former aides will exercise his Fifth Amendment right not to testify about the server before Congress. Hillary Clinton kicked off a campaign initiative targeted at female voters on Saturday in Portsmouth, N.H., where she received the endorsement of Sen. Jeanne Shaheen.\n                \n                    \n                    Darren McCollester/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Hillary Clinton kicked off a campaign initiative targeted at female voters on Saturday in Portsmouth, N.H., where she received the endorsement of Sen. Jeanne Shaheen. Clinton is also launching a \"Women for Hillary\" initiative this weekend. She picked up an endorsement from New Hampshire Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, the first woman in U.S. history to be elected both senator and governor. Clinton drew cheers and applause from the crowd for lines attacking Donald Trump, who is leading Republican polls, for his statements about women. \"Mr. Trump insults and dismisses women,\" Clinton said, and mocked Trump's statement that he would be \"far better\" at addressing women's health issues than she would. \"Now that's a general election debate that's going to be a lot of fun.\" It's not just the general election, though, that Clinton needs to win. She's also up against an increasingly robust challenge for the Democratic nomination. Independent Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont has been drawing large crowds all summer with his message of reducing the gap between rich and poor. His poll numbers are rising in key primary states. On the stump, he's talked about child malnutrition and called for paid family leave for new parents. Speaking in New Hampshire, Clinton said she's been talking about issues affecting families and children for years. \"I believe that raising incomes and supporting families is the defining economic challenge of our time,\" Clinton said. \"And these are not new fights for me.\"",

            "article_content": "#NPRreads is a weekly feature on Twitter and on The Two-Way. The premise is simple: Correspondents, editors and producers throughout our newsroom share pieces that have kept them reading. They share tidbits using the #NPRreads hashtag \u2014 and on Fridays, we highlight some of the best stories. This week, we bring you five reads. From Jessica Taylor, NPR political reporter His wife & sons disagree w/@ScottWalker on gay marriage-will it be a problem? A good piece from @mattklewis http://t.co/HZzOil5NYp #NPRreads Sometimes, the most interesting people in politics are those standing beside the candidates. That's the case of Tonette Walker, the wife of Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, who is set to launch his GOP presidential bid Monday. But could some of her political differences hurt her husband \u2014 and how much will voters hold him accountable for her own personal views? I've long been intrigued by Tonette Walker and edited a story about her when I was at The Hill. She endured immeasurable loss early in her life: Her grandmother who raised her, her brother and her first husband all died by the time she was 30, the same age I am. She later would meet her second husband, Scott \u2014 12 years her junior \u2014 in a BBQ joint, and he eventually won her over with his persistence in wooing her. She had a different background from Walker, the son of a Baptist preacher. She came from a union, Democratic household. And as the Daily Caller's Matt Lewis points out, some of those early differences could become flashpoints now in cultural debates. His take is based on a Washington Post story also profiling Tonette, noting her marked shift from her husband in the reaction to the Supreme Court decision legalizing same-sex marriage. She described how she was torn on the issue, especially since she has a cousin who is gay and who \"is like a sister to me\" and that their son was the best man at her wedding. Lewis, who often has some of the most pragmatic takes on the conservative movement, notes that first ladies and other political spouses breaking with their husbands on social issues is not new. But in a deeply divided Republican Party, it could be more damaging than in years past. \"Regardless, for social conservatives who already feel like they're on the ropes, this revelation is even more serious than you might think. For obvious reasons, social conservative leaders have little interest in alienating Walker, but even before this most recent interview came out, one leading socon told me his rule of thumb for evaluating candidates: The trick is to always look at the wife when gauging whether or not a male politician will hold true to his stated social values.\" So could his wife's candid revelations hurt Walker? Possibly. But it could also humanize him to more establishment conservatives, who want their party to be more inclusive, and in a general election if he makes it that far. It's a problem the GOP is struggling with across the board \u2014 how to be empathetic, especially as more and more people have gay friends and relatives or want gay conservatives to be included more within the party. He also notes that Walker's wife isn't the first to break from her husband: Laura Bush supported same-sex marriage and abortion, and both Dick and Lynne Cheney, whose daughter Mary is gay, were also supportive of same-sex marriage. Walker has staked much of his path to the GOP nomination through Iowa, where he needs social conservatives in order to win and carry on. The beliefs of both his wife and sons could call into question how much he would champion a rollback if he were in the White House, Lewis writes: \"[H]ouses are divided against themselves \u2014 where, on this issue, at least, Republican politicians and their wives are unequally yoked. It's hard to be outnumbered in your own family. They may not flip on the issue, but pols seem less likely to champion an issue when the people closest to them vehemently oppose it.\" From Alice Fordham, NPR Middle East correspondent The situation in Syria is so complicated it has moments of tragic absurdity, which Erika Solomon highlighted in this great piece. Both opposition-leaning and regime-linked TV production companies have tackled Syrian versions of the Godfather this Ramadan. The opposition one sounds edgy, playing on the widespread view among Syrians opposed to President Bashar Assad that he leads from amid a Mafia-like ring of corrupt and violent cronies. \"This Godfather, played by Jamal Suleiman, a staunch opposition supporter and TV star, is modelled on government officials who traded influence to cut business deals. Mr Wahbe [the director] says they struck the same kind of fear as Vito Corleone. 'The Godfather was a violent and powerful person, yet we never see him practise that violence. We see his strength by way of others' reactions \u2014 that's part of his magic,' Mr Wahbe says. 'There were definitely people like that in Syria, who created so much fear people whispered their names to avoid drawing attention.' \" The regime-linked version sounds a little ... tamer: \"The adaptation produced by Sama revisits some scenes from the Coppola film, but in Arabic. There are no clear political references, and some flashback scenes to old-time Syria could almost be mistaken for Sicily.\" Solomon visited the set of the opposition show \u2014 it's filmed in Lebanon because Syria is much more dangerous than Sicily ever was. I liked the part where the director had to yell at the gangster-actors to look more menacing. \"Don't hop around. You're mafia!\" From Elizabeth Blair, a reporter on NPR's Arts Desk \"Mass hysteria is usual led by fools getting things wrong.\" -Johnny Rotten @WSJ #nprreads http://t.co/YatyATvnke In high school and college, I was in awe of punks like Johnny Rotten (John Lydon) and The Sex Pistols. In the late 1970s and early '80s, punks were pissed off. They spit on social conventions and flipped authority the finger. Many of them were also smart and paid attention. Punk purists say the Pistols weren't the real thing, that the band was fabricated by London culture vultures Malcolm McLaren and Vivienne Westwood. To quote one friend, the Sex Pistols were \"like the Monkees of punk.\" I still thought they were pretty outrageous, but also accessible. With pop hooks and a sense of humor, their vitriolic rants were both shocking and danceable. Anarchy never sounded so fun. In Quentin Fottrell's lively Q&A with Lydon, we get a glimpse of the man's amusing, still provocative personality, and the rat-infested living quarters of his childhood. \"MarketWatch: You don't look angry at all on the cover of your book. You look adorable. \"John Lydon: I was trying to look like a dreadful World War I admiral from the German navy. It's a face that represents many things to many people. There is severity there, but humanity in the eyes if you look close enough. Have we spoken before? Your voice sounds familiar. \"MarketWatch: No, but I'm Irish. You're half-Irish. Maybe it's that. \"Lydon: I have a lot of friends in Ireland. I have an Irish passport. I also have an English one and an American passport. I'm looking for a round dozen.\" Lydon, now 59, also addresses some of the criticisms that he and the Sex Pistols were someone else's punk puppets. \"I'm not a manufactured pop star. Lies stick like that to you like glue. There's an awful lot of jealousy behind comments like that. I had a process of eliminating liars from my life. We will never achieve anything if we lie about each other.\" True to the punk tradition of challenging everything, here's what Lydon told Fottrell about the controversy surrounding the Confederate flag. \"MarketWatch: The future of the Confederate flag is in doubt. Some people say it symbolizes a resistance against federal powers, while others see it as belonging to a racist, bygone era. What do you think? \"Lydon: Mass hysteria is usually led by fools getting things wrong. Whenever something thing is represented so obviously as a negative I'm always suspicious because that represents a deeper, darker truth. I don't think that it's right to assume that it's a racist flag having studied American history in order to become an American. The next logical steps would be to eliminate all of these flags. Bad people have misrepresented these flags for as long as I've studied history. There's also a movement in Britain to eliminate the Union Jack. You can't eliminate the past. The truth will never kill you. The truth will set you free. Transparence in all things will lead to a greater sense of humanity. I belong to planet Earth. Let's have a worldwide flag.\" No doubt there's more to piss people off where that came from in Lydon's new memoir, Anger Is An Energy: My Life Uncensored. Can't wait to read it. From Ted Robbins, NPR supervising editor for arts, culture and books #nprreads the quiet racism of Instagram filters. And Kodak film http://t.co/VLYsvJ5S9N This piece came to me as a suggestion from Vox. Here's the passage that hooked me into reading the whole thing: \"Kodak's film was so bad at capturing the different hues and saturations of black skin that when director Jean Luc Godard was sent on an assignment to Mozambique in 1977, he flat-out refused to use Kodak on the grounds that its stock was 'racist.' Only when the candy and furniture industries began complaining that they couldn't accurately shoot dark chocolate and brown wood furniture did Kodak start to improve its technology.\" As an amateur photographer and former television news reporter, I knew that dark skin absorbs more light, so requires more lighting. But I had no idea that film stock was biased toward lighter tones. Now, it seems, digital tools like the wildly popular Instagram filters are doing the same thing. The author, Morgan Jerkins, is a 20-something writer in New York. She thoughtfully looks at the phenomenon of Instagram filters being used by women and, I presume, men of color to lighten their skin in photographs. And she is critical of it. \"In the name of enhancing or beautifying our photos, filters inevitably alter our appearances beyond recognition,\" she writes. Jerkins shows how filters change photographs with interactive features in the article. She even asked women to alter their images and recorded their reactions. What started me reading was my surprise about old technology: film. What kept me reading was how the same truism applies to new photographic methods: We may think technology is just an unbiased tool, but at least in this case, it has bias built into it. From Kirk Siegler, an NPR reporter who covers California and the West good piece here from @TheMisreadCity on the middle class being priced out of Los Angeles http://t.co/YgKhYE54Sg #nprreads Journalists who have lived in Los Angeles \u2014 or any other expensive city for that matter \u2014 can't help but see a bit of themselves in Scott Timberg's story. A former reporter with the Los Angeles Times, Timberg writes poignantly in LA Observed about being priced out of the city he grew to love. Timberg lost his job covering books and authors for the newspaper during a wave of layoffs amid the financial crisis of 2008. He has since struggled to scrape by with enough freelance gigs to make ends meet, losing his house in the process and being forced to squeeze his young family into a much smaller apartment. The piece begins and ends as Timberg wrestles with his rocky love affair with Los Angeles \u2014 a city, he says, he quickly grew to love and now frankly, can't afford to love. \"The area's pull is as strong as ever. Sandal-wearing Silicon Valley types are buying up midcentury Westside homes from which to commute to Mountain View because it's cheaper here than South of Market. With so many art schools and galleries in Greater Los Angeles, the city is attracting striving artists who, willing to live on a shoestring, would have once considered New York the only place to be. For them, trading one high-rent city for another isn't that difficult. For prominent creatives like Moby, Chlo\u00eb Sevigny, and Lena Dunham, relocating (or at least buying property) here means more square footage and sunlight than in New York, which, conventional wisdom holds, has become blander as the middle class has been pushed out by exorbitant property values. And thousands of wealthy Chinese nationals are buying into the San Gabriel Valley, making a newly mansionized Arcadia 'the Chinese Beverly Hills.' \" This description pretty much nails it. Los Angeles is booming and as dynamic and interesting and exciting as ever right now. But as Timberg goes on to note, this boom is also leaving many people on the margins. The disparity between wages and market prices is worse here than in the Bay Area or New York, he writes. A recent survey showed homelessness is up by 12 percent and the number of homeless encampments in this city has increased by a startling 85 percent. A recent study for City Hall further noted that nearly a quarter of Angelenos are living below the federal poverty line. Not exactly an easy place to be living as a freelance writer without a steady paycheck, right? The rub here for Timberg is that LA, like for so many other people, has long been a draw in our national psyche for creatives: People come here to make it, make something or just be different and explore new things. Reading this, it's clear that Timberg is sour on the prospects of this continuing in a city that he says is pricing so many people out: \"If L.A. began as a love affair with a beautiful and engaging (albeit neurotic) young woman, the city now seems like the girl who cheated on me and passed on a disease.\" I did come away puzzled about one thing after I finished this piece. The top choice for Timberg to move to appears to be Santa Fe, N.M. But won't he essentially be trading one expensive city for another? Albeit not as expensive, but Santa Fe isn't without its share of inequalities. Perhaps that's fodder for a future piece of his we'll most surely be on the lookout for.",

The former editor of the Los Angeles Times died Sunday at age 73.\n                \n                    \n                    Vince Bucci/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption John Carroll speaks at the International Women's Media Foundation's 15th Annual Courage in Journalism Awards in 2004 in Beverly Hills, Calif. The former editor of the Los Angeles Times died Sunday at age 73. I have written precisely one letter that made any notable difference to my life. I mailed it to John Carroll, the editor of The Baltimore Sun, when I was 24 years old. I had covered higher education for several years in Durham, N.C., and I wrote, presumptuously, that Carroll's pages gave the colleges and universities of Maryland short shrift. Naturally, I offered myself as the solution to a problem that I had so helpfully identified. Carroll, who died Sunday morning, became my editor for six years at the Sun, where he revived the paper's standards and national profile; he then went on to restore the Los Angeles Times to distinction after scandal and leading it to 13 Pulitzer Prizes in just five years. That's an almost unimaginable record for a paper west of the Hudson or Potomac rivers. The man who took a chance on me (and who reminded me of that fact when I once came up short on a story) proved at once ambitious, charismatic, curious, drily witty, exacting, genteel, hard-driving, and inspiring. He radiated unusual calm, even as he was infuriating editors and reporters with yet another request for more reporting, more writing, more editing. \"A journalist's work is a counterweight to the misuse of power,\" Carroll said in an address to the Committee to Protect Journalists in 2004. \"A journalist lives or dies by that humblest form of knowledge, the simple fact. And a journalist, when things get tough, can serve only one master: the public.\" He covered Vietnam and Watergate as a reporter for The Baltimore Sun before leading regional papers. But had he gone on to edit The Washington Post or The New York Times, he'd have been a legendary figure instead of an editor honored largely inside his profession. Carroll's dedication to the civic purpose of journalism instilled pride in many journalists that such editors work elsewhere. Many of the newsrooms he led walked a bit taller. In Philadelphia, as city editor, John helped the Inquirer overcome a corrupt past to become one of the nation's preeminent papers. He personally oversaw an investigative series on police brutality against suspects there, rewriting the lead to give it more punch \u2014 a piece made all the more vital given the power the police wielded in that city. In Lexington, Ky., where he first became executive editor, Carroll championed an investigation that proved boosters had paid cash \u2014 against NCAA rules \u2014 to recruits for the beloved University of Kentucky basketball program. Protests against the investigation included a bomb threat and a gunshot fired inside the paper's pressroom. A journalist's work is a counterweight to the misuse of power. A journalist lives or dies by that humblest form of knowledge, the simple fact. And a journalist, when things get tough, can serve only one master: the public. John Carroll, in an address to the Committee to Protect Journalists in 2004 At The Baltimore Sun, he sent a black city columnist and a white foreign correspondent to expose systemic slavery in Sudan. To prove the point, the pair bought two slaves and released them to freedom. After reading a piece on a sidelined vessel in the Baltimore harbor, Carroll commissioned what would become a Pulitzer prize-winning series on shipbreaking, the deadly practice of dismantling discarded ships. In Los Angeles, he unified a demoralized staff by focusing energies on its journalism. One front-page project exposed the incompetence with which an inner-city hospital gave care to patients. Recognizing an overlooked industry's importance to his region, he assigned the paper's first beat reporter to cover pornography \u2014 and then enjoyed putting playful headlines on some of the first stories that ensued. (The LA Times recalled one of them in its obituary: \"Lights, Camera, Viagra!\") He warned against liberal bias creeping into headlines and copy. But he liked a scrap regardless of partisan stripe: Just days before the election that transformed Republican action movie star Arnold Schwarzenegger into the governor of California, Carroll published an extensive report documenting allegations of sexual harassment. Carroll wrote that voters deserved to know about the behavior of candidates they vote for and warned readers who disagreed that they might not want to keep subscribing. He disdained business meetings, a virtue that these days would be seen as a vanity, and denounced newspaper executives who sought to prop up profits despite structural shifts in the industry and tossed underperforming properties aside. \"These papers are like cards in a deck; you shuffle them, you deal them, you fold them,\" he told me after the collapse and sale of the Knight Ridder newspaper chain, which had included the Inquirer and the Lexington Herald-Leader. \"And the meaning of them as an institution in the community seems to have been lost.\" When asked by the LA Times' owners at the Tribune Co. in Chicago to make yet another budget cut in 2005, Carroll resigned. He said the push to boost profits came at too high a journalistic cost. John did not lack for gumption. **** Like all editors, Carroll had his blind spots. In Baltimore in the mid-1990s, Carroll had a falling out with David Simon, already an accomplished police reporter. Carroll believed the poverty, crime and addiction that plagued Baltimore required incisive coverage. But he found certain articles dwelled too much on the city's dysfunction. Simon developed a powerful piece on an addict who stripped copper pipes from row houses in Baltimore's residential neighborhoods. His astonishing story served as a metaphor for the invisible hollowing out of the city. Carroll objected that it lionized the addict's criminal activities, a kind of poverty porn. The piece was delayed and ran in the paper's diminished magazine section rather than on the front page. In Simon's masterful HBO series The Wire, the addict appeared as a hopeful character tottering on the edge of redemption. Carroll was lampooned as a waspy, patronizing figure from a different age, out of touch with his newsroom and his city. Carroll later privately told me he should have worked harder to harness Simon's drive, though the reporter's enormous talent and anger destined him for bigger things anyway. But Simon's fictionalized depiction was unfair to Carroll as well. Simon believed Carroll was focused on prizes at the expense of meaningful journalism. Carroll also had a blind spot about his industry's future. I remember asking John once \u2014 it must have been around 1997 or 1998 \u2014 what he thought of The Washington Post's website. The site was a dazzling effort to offer a fresh experience beyond print. John told me he'd settle for competence and let the Graham family spend $70 million or so a year on the website until they figured out a way to make money from all those bits and bytes. He was wrong about the importance of digital transformation to the profession. But at the same time, he had a point. Don Graham's team never did crack that code. His family sold the paper to someone they believed had a better chance to do so: Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. **** We were not close friends, but John was always welcoming on the phone or in person. When I last saw him, in December, we lingered over lunch in Lexington, where he and his wife Lee had returned to retire. We swapped stories about children (his and mine) and grandchildren (his) and journalism (everyone's). That said, I noted he was somewhat frailer than before. About a month later he was diagnosed with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, a rare and incurable neurological disease. On that afternoon, however, he showed flashes of the vigor and verve that defined his years in newsrooms. After lunch, we took a quick drive and walked about the University of Kentucky. With pointillist detail, he identified telling elements of the atrium of the library, where he was burrowing into the archives in pursuit of the book that was to be his final project. Once again, he had decided to focus on the university's athletics program. Once again, he had uncovered scandals with hilarious twists spanning as far back as a century ago. He laughed at the punch lines to his own anecdotes. But he was intent on nailing down all the facts just so. The man loved a good story. And he wanted it to be bulletproof.",

When Leila Steinberg was 25 years old, she met a 17-year-old named Tupac. She became involved in his career in a managerial role, which she had stepped away from by about 1993. The next time Steinberg agreed to a management relationship with a musician was almost 20 years later. At the request of Earl Sweatshirt's mother, she began working with him while he was still in Samoa. And then she went and got him, brought him home. We spoke to Leila about her relationships with both rappers, and the work she's done apart from them. ALI SHAHEED MUHAMMAD: Welcome, Leila. FRANNIE KELLEY: Thank you. LEILA STEINBERG: Thank you. KELLEY: We are glad to be in warm California in January talking to you. STEINBERG: Right? It is -- KELLEY: I mean, I am. STEINBERG: It's beautiful outside. KELLEY: 75. Not bad. Good life choices get you to places like this, I think. MUHAMMAD: Hm. STEINBERG: I'm still doing a rain dance though. KELLEY: Weirdos. All of you. So we wanted to talk to you about your history and what you're doing now, but I wonder if we might start with where you guys first crossed paths. MUHAMMAD: Leila and I? KELLEY: Yeah. MUHAMMAD: My only recollection of the first time we met was at the Hammerstein ballroom, backstage. KELLEY: In New York. MUHAMMAD: In New York. And this was \u2014 was it two years ago? STEINBERG: Two years ago. MUHAMMAD: It was two years ago. Oh. Not bad, brain. STEINBERG: I think we've been back two-and-a-half years. You're good. KELLEY: OK. MUHAMMAD: And it was the first concert of Earl Sweatshirt with Odd Future since his mysterious disappearance. STEINBERG: His return from Samoa. MUHAMMAD: Yeah. STEINBERG: Yes. That was a big one. KELLEY: OK. STEINBERG: I've \u2014 we've crossed paths, not officially, for years because music, and I'm a huge fan. So. MUHAMMAD: Thank you. STEINBERG: And I was quiet, always in the cut, so there were many times I was places that people wouldn't know I was there. KELLEY: Right. I feel you. STEINBERG: So. MUHAMMAD: I identify with that. That's how I like to roll too. KELLEY: That's why this is a -- STEINBERG: I've been in your path so many times. You just didn't know. MUHAMMAD: Yeah, right. KELLEY: This is the podcast for quiet people, that see you, though. STEINBERG: But that, that show, that was like my first coming back out into music in a long time in a work capacity and -- KELLEY: After 20 years away, basically. STEINBERG: Well, no, I'd say ten years, really not active. At least ten, at that point. So, yeah. MUHAMMAD: That show, that was interesting for me because of the relationship with my attorney, Julian Petty, who was also \u2014 I don't know what the relationship is with you and Julian now. STEINBERG: He's Earl's lawyer, yeah. MUHAMMAD: OK. And I've been following Odd Future. And so when Julian asked me about Earl and linking up with him, I was like, cool. But just seeing him in that environment was like \u2014 it made me feel really aged. Only because \u2014 but in a good way \u2014 because I saw his nervousness. How are you able to help him deal with that? Like, there was a lot happening in that moment. STEINBERG: With Earl, there's \u2014 it's \u2014 what a journey. I wouldn't even know how to describe this journey. I'm thankful. He gave me something back that I really appreciate. I love music. I think music is one of our most important vehicles on the planet, always has been. And \u2014 so my work, my life, has been in the development of art that can transform the planet. And so my introduction to Earl was so different because it was really through my work in law and my connection to his mom. So I came in as a parent, not as a music businessperson. And really the plan was that I would help him transition into a healthy life back in LA pursuing his dream, but not that I would be really active in his business. And I think that because we have such a warped idea about business and it's a toxic world, the music business, that I realized, as I wanted to transition out, that maybe I was supposed to be in here to help bring the lessons I learned from all the artists I loved and lost to Earl. So I haven't been able to leave. I've gone through all of the rollercoaster ride with him, as someone who loves him and as a family member that's now part of his musical family also. And there'll be a day that I won't be as active. I do see my active role as transitional, but I think we need more people like me in the business I've decided. As I copped out and left, I realized that I was doing disservice. We have to reframe what we do with business and the arts. And so, yeah. Here I am, after a long leave. KELLEY: So can you tell us the story so that we can, like, make sure it's all out there accurately -- STEINBERG: The story of Leila and Earl? KELLEY: Yeah. I mean, I can go and you can tell me what's wrong or which is overstated. So somebody on the board at his school approached you? STEINBERG: Well, I have a long relationship with Larry Brezner who has a film and management company. He basically started with Robin Williams, Billy Crystal. He's been in the business a long time and he was very active at Earl's school, New Roads. And I've been working very closely with my non-profit and professor Jody Armour. He heads the department at USC. He's not just an educator in the law department and a law professor but he's done a lot in music also. He's done some really amazing things. So there are all these intersections and working with Jody, we studied a lot of Cheryl Harris' work, Professor Harris at UCLA. KELLEY: Earl's mom. STEINBERG: Earl's mom. And so I wanted to connect with Cheryl for a long time and her work. And out of the blue one day, Larry Brezner calls me and says, \"Leila, I've got this kid from New Roads. There's been some issues and I want to talk to you. We need your help.\" I do a lot of intervention \u2014 people can call me any hour of the day or night. They have a kid that gets arrested in juvenile hall. They need intervention. They need guidance. So I've done a lot in navigating criminal justice and families. And so I went to a meeting and it ended up being a meeting with Larry and Earl's mother. And the funny thing is I showed Earl's video \u2014 a while before, his first video \u2014 in our class in the law department to talk about just the power of youth culture in one artist and the ability for that artist to drive movement and the intersection of punk and hip-hop. And so I was commenting on this video and suddenly I'm in a meeting with the woman I've been wanting to meet forever and admired her work and Larry telling me about this kid whose story I know because my son was a big Earl fan. And when I saw the video, I was like, wow. And then I began to study the whole OF movement. I have a son from the Westside who kept saying, \"Mom, you want to know about lyrics,\" you know. And I was like, \"I don't know if I'm feeling this.\" So I had a moment with my son and I dived in. And I felt like I called him to me because his mom said that she really wanted to give him motivation to complete his program. He wasn't cooperating very well. There was a lot going on. Would I be interested in building a dialog and maybe doing my curriculum and my workshop that I do, my Mic Sessions, with him through the phone and Skype and whatever? And I had never done this before. So I thought what a challenge. And the other challenge was that I couldn't tell anyone including my kids because there was a big campaign to free Earl and where was he. And everyone I know wanted to know where he was. So it was so intriguing. I couldn't say no. And I would have done anything for Cheryl. So that's really how it started. I said, you know, \"Your son has to want to do something with me and if he does and he completes his levels, I'll go get him.\" I just said that. I didn't know. I always say things. I speak 'em. You know, Samoa \u2014 I hate flying. KELLEY: Oh, really? STEINBERG: I'm terrified of flying. I fly all the time. But those 20 hour flights, like South Africa, Samoa, I'm not feeling. KELLEY: It's all the drugs. All of them. STEINBERG: We had our first conversation and he said, \"Oh, I just read the Mike Dyson books. Someone had it in here. I can't believe --\" KELLEY: Holler If You Hear Me. STEINBERG: \"--you're talking to me.\" So we built from that first conversation. We began to have office hours every week. It was like, \"You're really gonna come get me?\" And so we made an agreement. I said that if he completed his levels and did the assignments and would write back and forth with me, I would come get him. But that he had to make arrangements that I could introduce my curriculum and my work in that facility. I could come do some workshops. And then, in the facility, you always get a community service that relates to your issues. And a lot of the issues people had with Earl were around his lyrics and just the accountability and violence and sexual lyrics. And so he ended up having to work in a facility called \"victim's support,\" which is the only center on the island that serves sexually assaulted youth. So every day he'd have to go and spend time with these kids and it was having a profound impact on him. And so, hearing about it I was like, I got to get to those kids too. So he made the agreement and he kept telling me and doing so that the kids in the facility were going to hate me. \"They won't feel \u2014 they're going to hate you. You don't understand. These aren't the kids you serve in struggling neighborhoods or juvenile hall, kids catching cases for gang issues or violence. These are privileged kids whose parents send them away and they don't want to hear you.\" So me, I know the power of music. I spent 20 years building this curriculum where I use art for emotional education and emotional healing. And you can penetrate any wall in anybody if you understand how to utilize the tools. So he completed his levels. He said he was ready long before I imagined a trip to Samoa. And I had to honor my word. And Larry and his mom were fully ready to support my going. They were like, \"Go. Take some time.\" And I said, \"No. I can't go without my team. I'm going to work.\" And it's really expensive to take ten people to Samoa and document it. So I don't know how but in three weeks we raised the money and we all got on a plane. And it was one of the most \u2014 I have to thank Earl all the time. I've traveled all over, but to be able to go to Samoa and actually spend time there, work there, and be embraced by a lot of the indigenous people \u2014 and one of the most powerful things that happened on that trip is I did a lot of work with gangs in Long Beach. So I had a kid from Long Beach who was in my group. He had a pretty hard history. His family was from the village that we were going to in Apia, but he had never been out of Long Beach. And so I said, you know, \"We're going to the village your family's from. We'll have to work pretty hard --\" My partner, Marisol, who's a teacher in Long Beach, did a lot of work so that he could get approved to go. But we brought him with us to the village his family's from and Earl was his guide in his home. So it was really amazing. Just to take all the kids I brought from LA and around \u2014 you know, there were other kids from outside of LA \u2014 but this group of artists who got to have the experience of service and just \u2014 it was so deep. It was beautiful. I want to go back. MUHAMMAD: You make me want to go. STEINBERG: It was an amazing place. So, yeah. KELLEY: So then, when you got back \u2014 OK, so, first of all, I read somewhere \u2014 I can't remember where \u2014 that when you guys landed at LAX the cops were screaming Earl's name? STEINBERG: Yeah, that was really crazy. KELLEY: That's bananas. How many people -- STEINBERG: Everywhere we went \u2014 he left and he wasn't a celebrity. And he came home \u2014 not only was he isolated and had no technology available for a year-and-a-half but his friends were all famous. He was in a position where he had to navigate a very difficult relationship with his mother and her feelings about the group. She was really vilified because she just wanted to help her son. She felt like he was in trouble. And I'm a parent who \u2014 my daughter that's 28 now, my grandson's about to be 10. Out of all my kids, she's the one that put me through the most. An amazing, beautiful young woman that had a time where I was like, I could lose my daughter. So as a parent, you do what you have to do. And, at that point in time, removing him from people, places, and things, and saying, \"You're going to finish school. You're not going to abuse your body. You're going to get focused,\" was what she did. And his friends didn't understand that cause they're kids and they miss their friend. So I'd say one of the roles I also played was helping mediate relationships and I'm still doing it because there's so much pain when you grow and you grow apart at times and you have to come back together. So you have a large group of \u2014 you know, it's a huge collective. And at a different points, different people get the attention. And that's some of the work I want to do in developing artists now. Is just to really help artists understand their humanity and power and what happens when you get power quickly and, you know, just the process of money. KELLEY: Right. STEINBERG: And so, that's the Earl -- KELLEY: I have one more question about this. And I'm sorry. I know I'm \u2014 so, you \u2014 but you were vilified also. STEINBERG: Oh, yeah. For sure. KELLEY: I remember the boards on February 8th, 2012. STEINBERG: The OF -- KELLEY: Yeah. So what happened was he put a teaser video. And he said, I'll give you the whole song if I get to 50k followers and the Internet just loses their minds. First of all, whose idea was that because it was \u2014 it was just so adept. STEINBERG: Well, there's a \u2014 I have such a large collective of young people that I mentor in my Mic Sessions. And I actually met a young man named Asher Underwood who runs Truth About Tupac, the website. And what I realize is when we lose people, we have to think about how to maintain their legacy and especially someone like Tupac. And so there are all these kids who are devoting their life to his legacy. And I like Asher because he was committed to the truth about Tupac. And he had a real great sense of technology in a way that I will never and don't care to. But he didn't try to appease me and he \u2014 in his seeking truth, it wasn't a one-dimensional truth. So out of everybody that I've seen that wants to grow the legacy \u2014 even in how he approached me, he asked me questions I didn't like, things that were uncomfortable. And so I began to reel him in and pull him in just because I think that we have to let \u2014 it's youth culture so we have to give them their voice and get out of the way. So when I was going to get Earl, I would \u2014 I started talking to Asher just about, you know \u2014 it's scary when you've been away and you have to jump in and deal with technology. And I wanted to give Earl the opportunity to think about how he wanted to grow his career, but to let his fans and he have ownership. And so I asked Asher and he's the one that did that and came up with the plan for Earl to get everybody to follow him. But not to do anything but to have a landing place because I knew that the guys in Odd Future did a lot. They worked their butts off for him to have an opportunity and so they had to be validated also, even though they felt like I was the enemy, and who was this who-ever coming to take him. I always wanted to find a way to bring everybody to a place where they were all validated, all communicating, and move forward. And so, you know, Chris \u2014 I went with through a lot with Chris and Kelly. They worked really hard. I totally understood why people were mad -- KELLEY: The Clancys. Yeah. STEINBERG: \u2014 and had issues with me. Because the other thing I would always encourage people to do \u2014 and I'm not a good example. I'm pretty much the hypocrite here. If you don't tell your own story, other people will tell it for you. And I've been silenced so much because I don't like the media. And so many times things were misrepresented that I didn't do justice to my part in the truth and I don't want to do that anymore. And so, because I didn't communicate and other people virally started seeing things \u2014 and I was not allowed to talk about what I was doing. So I couldn't talk about it. And then I think what happened was Ray Luv, who is my dear friend and who is really the reason I worked with Tupac, he got so excited because he felt like Earl was so gifted. And he found out I was going to Samoa and he said something on Twitter, which was really \u2014 he was excited and wanting to empower me. It wasn't exactly accurate because nobody got the information directly from me. And then, rightfully, OF was like, \"What the --\" KELLEY: What did he say? STEINBERG: Something like, \"Oh, now Earl's part of the family.\" Some kind of whatever. And he had already had a family here. KELLEY: Right. A family. STEINBERG: So, it was weird. And it was probably good because it forced the conversation faster. And we all had to sit down and have an emotional he-say, you-blame, whatever. KELLEY: Yeah. STEINBERG: And I love all of them, you know? I've built a close relationship with many members of the group, some I don't know as well. Hodgy used to come to my Mic Sessions long before there was an OF. I taught at the school that Tyler went to. It's crazy. We started realizing that we were all in the family. So. KELLEY: Yeah. Well, I mean, so \u2014 and this is my last question about this \u2014 but so, Professor Harris is vilified. Sorry. She's a professor, right? STEINBERG: Yeah, she's actually UCLA. She -- KELLEY: Yeah. So Professor Harris is vilified. You're vilified. In a weird way, they were both \u2014 you were both taking care of him and then you went and got him \u2014 you freed Earl. I mean, Earl freed himself with some assistance from you. And what is it like to move in a world \u2014 and by world, I don't mean rap world or even the industry, I mean everybody's everyday world, like, society, American society \u2014 to try to be working with people who are disrespectful to you, like, constantly. That was the feeling in the forums, was that you were the enemy and that Earl had no agency. Like, Earl couldn't possibly have made this decision on his own. STEINBERG: Earl was in a really difficult position because he had his mom here. He had a music family and his family. And nobody really understands how painful it is to sit at that crossroads. And I think that when I told you earlier that I was always identity-challenged and racially-challenged in our family \u2014 I have a father who came from a Polish family. They immigrated. Jewish. And my dad married my mom very young. My mom's family immigrated from Mexico. I'm first-born here. She's got family from Turkey, Middle East. So we have this very interesting family. And then my father re-married 30 years ago, a black woman. So I have a black stepmother, mixed kids. And many family members on either side that were never OK with these unions. So when you come in in conflict, you either are damaged and you let the pain affect you or you step outside and take these challenges and realize your work is in making a difference in these areas. So I would say that I've always navigated that territory. I've always been kind of in a position to either be a voice and help mend the situation or not do anything. I think that some of us are born and that's part of the work we do in this life. With Earl, because of the lack of understanding and what happened early on, there wasn't much budging on either side. I think that to be his mother \u2014 I would never be OK until I got some sort of acknowledgment and apology, and in a forum that the conversation started. So she was really hurt. Her son at some point has to defend his mom if he knows her decision was right or not. Remind me to tell you about Ted Nugent's son before we're done because it reminds me of -- KELLEY: Writing it down. STEINBERG: \u2014 we, at some point, have to stand with our parents or stand up. And so, in this situation, Earl knew that his mother did what she felt was the best thing for her son. So it complicated it because he didn't articulate it the way he might have needed to at that time for his friends to understand. So there was this big lack of communication and a kid \u2014 cause he's a kid when he got back \u2014 being pulled both directions. So what he made the decision to do, because he was in a position to do a deal anywhere. They did the work, which we all know, and built their following up and helped him be in a position to go get a deal. What he chose to do was do a deal that would allow him to be part of the family, where they would benefit. He spent the last two years doing any and everything, pretty much, that they asked. But also, he had to have some autonomy so his mom could feel that he handled his business and did what he was supposed to do. So being in a position where you're pulled from both directions, he sat in the middle and kind of worked to bring everybody to him. And he's still working it out. It's not all worked out. It's a lifetime journey to be a strong communicator. Anybody who masters communication can have anything they want. So, I think they did better than some of the evolutions of the groups that I worked with early on cause things got really volatile with OF. They're all finding their own voice but everyone's at least still communicating. So. KELLEY: Good job, everybody. STEINBERG: Does that answer? MUHAMMAD: It makes me wonder why you're not called \u2014 or maybe you are called on to be a part of musician's careers in that regard, especially groups. Cause as you're speaking, I'm sitting here thinking about my own group and the breakdown in communication and how we were able to overcome that but how we were a little bit older, you know? But often, you are younger and don't have those faculties to be able to manage a situation. And I'm thinking of everyone else from EPMD, Fugees, and stuff like that and it just makes wonder: are you called more often? STEINBERG: No, not really. You know, I don't think we look at \u2014 and as we look at race and we look at the truth about education and how dysfunctional we are, I think that white males primarily are conditioned to seek everything possible for advancement, whether it's business growth and planning to strategies for families to getting therapy. And so in the communities that I grew up in, you know, therapy is like \u2014 no one wants to get therapy. We don't ask for mediation. We don't go take the classes that would advance us. It's very hard to invest in ourselves. And I would say Tupac was an amazing teacher for me, as one of the first artists I worked with, because he was so brilliant and he read so much. He was all about learning strategies, but he was still too young to implement. He was in a real studying space. But he motivated me to understand my power, and that I sat in a really key position to be at the tables people couldn't get at, to get into doors that were difficult for others. And I didn't appreciate my privilege. I ran from that. Tupac really told me off, you know. When I first started working with him \u2014 I never went after anybody. I was an artist in my young motherhood days. In high school, I always wanted to be in the band. And my mom left when I was young. My dad raised me. My mom moved to the Bay. So my dad as my primary parent raised me kind of like his oldest son. So I got some great messages from having a man raise me but I didn't necessarily have a sense of worth and value in the ways that I needed to really have success. And so I always vacillated. I wanted to do everything but I never just felt like I'm going to put 200% in. So I was in bands and I was a young mother and I went to school for sports therapy. I worked with athletes in the '80s. So, when I met Tupac, I had little girls and he was like, \"How are you going to really parent and be the parent that you want to be and not the parent your mother was and run around in a band? You say you want to touch the world and you want to \u2014 you got to learn business. And I could be your first business.\" And so I was like, \"That's crazy. I don't know anything \u2014 I'm not good at business.\" KELLEY: Can we just say really quickly that at this time he's 17 and you're 25. STEINBERG: Yeah. Something like that. KELLEY: That's bananas. STEINBERG: Yes. And he definitely was older than me. And I said no, I couldn't do it, wouldn't know how. And he was like, \"Are you kidding? Your last name. The access you have. You understand art. You have everything it takes. Read some books.\" So that was my beginning of transitioning into doing business for people. And it was guided by \u2014 it was all needs-based, someone that needed me to do something and thought I could do it, convinced me, and I did. And kept going. KELLEY: Can you tell a story of a specific time cause I wrote down that \u2014 oh, I don't have it right here but \u2014 you told XXL, like, four years ago, \"He made me the white woman that he needed me to be when I needed to be that or the Mexican woman who spoke Spanish.\" Do you have a specific memory of a time when you were like, \"OK. Today I got to do this. I got to be this.\" STEINBERG: Oh my gosh, all the time. We wanted to have his first show at the Santa Rosa Fairgrounds. It's this great place. My \u2014 and this is where it really started \u2014 but my ex would try to rent facilities and he'd go and say, \"I want to do a show. How much is it?\" And they were always booked. We could never get a facility. So I began to be, \"Hi. I'm Leila Steinberg. I'm doing an event to benefit kids. Da-da-da.\" And suddenly the date would be open. And we began to document the many times that Tupac or Bruce or Ray or people that were young and black couldn't access, couldn't get a facility, couldn't get an interview, and how easy it was for me to walk in and get that same place for rent, that apartment, that car, that loan. And the funny thing is my credit was often not as good as some of the young black males that were turned down just on appearance so. I don't know if that was specific but -- KELLEY: It was. It was plenty. MUHAMMAD: I'm just wondering do you still have Microphone Sessions? STEINBERG: I do. MUHAMMAD: How are you able to convey to \u2014 I don't know the type of kids that come to your sessions. First of all, are there older people that come and volunteer? STEINBERG: So, just for \u2014 yes. Just so I can put this out: you can find out about my non-profit at aim4theheart.org. And I've been doing workshops for almost 30 years now. It's been a long time. I never stop. I had a class last night. And the great thing is that I now have a curriculum. I do a training once a year and so it happens whether I'm there or not. Someone last month said when my son taught the class he was so much better than me. And I had to laugh. So it means that we have a process that works. It's kind of the intersection. It's kind of like me and who I am. So I have kids that come from privilege, kids that come from poverty, kids that are still active in gangs, kids that have never seen outside of Brentwood. And I have 13 year olds and 60 year olds. Like, you know, going to church or temple or the mosque, you have everybody there and our common denominator is our love of art and whatever the word of the week is. This week it's direction. There might be a classical artist or an opera artist or a rapper and everyone has to marinate on that same word. And then we have a conversation through our art, as a group. And, you know, kids come for artist development. I still believe in artist development but I believe everyone's an artist, whether you're a lawyer, doctor, whatever it is. And that we have to live our lives understanding that whatever our passion is is our art, and how do we craft a life around that. And so they don't know they're coming to class for emotional education or emotional literacy. But as we look at the issues right now that are most prevalent, the two areas were most damaged in is our hearts and our pockets. Like, as a people, globally, we have \u2014 everybody has a damaged heart. All we want is to feel value and loved. I mean, at the core of every human being that's all that matters and we need to sustain ourselves and survive. I'm definitely not the model for financial education, but it's as important as emotional. But I understand that geography very well. And so I've packaged a way to teach kids and put words to feelings and navigate those feelings so that we can manage our pain and behavior and we don't have to shoot up schools and act out. And suddenly when you become human beings to one another in a shared space, it makes it hard to go outside on the block and see your neighbor as an enemy. And I've worked so much with gangs. My dad was a criminal defense attorney. He raised me around criminal defense and the imbalance in our laws. So I really had a front row seat. I was very groomed to understand this dynamic. I still work in San Quentin. I have a program with the lifers since 1990, No More Tears. So I'm all about bringing balance and truth to these very painful subjects. MUHAMMAD: I'm sure that you've made such an impact in ones that, you know, may be highlighted in a famous sense like Earl, like Tupac, maybe there's some others that we don't know about. I'm wondering \u2014 because you said something earlier about how there's a difference in what is taught based off of race. And so \u2014 not necessarily for the people who come who are able to impact and interact with you and benefit from the environment that you have created, but more so the outside people who may be looking in or you may have some sort of relationship, do they really understand that there is a lack of opportunity \u2014 from an emotional sense, from an economic sense \u2014 that it's not an excuse, that it is something that's really blocking different people \u2014 you know, young, raced, black, Hispanic, and that is a real \u2014 it's not, like, a facade. It's tangible. STEINBERG: It's why I do the work I do. It's so painful to me. It's so imbalanced and I'm so tired of \u2014 even my own family members \u2014 \"Oh, it's choice.\" No, it is not choice. Choice is based on your formative opportunities and access to things that we don't have any balance in. I know. I lived on 64th and Vermont and I lived on Las Flores Beach in Malibu. As a kid, I know how hard it was to let go of my friends and the guilt I felt because my father had a booming criminal law practice, this very young lawyer, and we had upward mobility. And I began to see that when you go to school in Santa Monica or you're in Malibu at a really young \u2014 \"Oh my god, they live like this?\" MUHAMMAD: Have there been any \u2014 like, maybe from a corporate level or maybe from a legislative position \u2014 who understand that and who has been quietly instrumental in helping bring forth change? STEINBERG: Very, very little. It's really difficult. And I don't want to point or shine light on specific names but there \u2014 and that's why I love all the artists I work with. Pac, losing Pac at the time that we lost him was so detrimental because he really got it and he wanted to serve that cause. And he's been, to date, like, one of my only funding sources because all the money from The Rose That Grew From Concrete that I get on my side of it, strictly to programs for youth. And it's like, I have a couple artists now that I really think could be that big that we could get legislature and get support. But it's very difficult. Once you get to a certain level you get quiet. And you're so controlled by the alignments you have with brands or whoever's sitting on top of you that no one's forcing these issues and it's one of the most important things we can do. I don't know. I'm doing the work every day. We need a lot more involvement. And that's what drew me \u2014 I never thought I'd be interested in law, having a father who's a lawyer. And I don't know how I found my way to Professor Armour, but I've been co-teaching with him at SC, the race and stereotypes class in the law department, and all the work I did in San Quentin has me thinking that my next work will probably be in law and that I have to come full circle. MUHAMMAD: Well, I certainly hope that you don't shy away from that because, from what I've learned in this short conversation, is that you seem to maybe put up your own blocks. And I understand that. I'm myself learning to not do that and be that. So in hearing of all the wonderful things that you have done and that you do still, if that comes knocking, it would be a great \u2014 it would be a great reward for everyone, really. STEINBERG: I'm thinking \u2014 I'm just like, wow. Back to school? But, you know, that's where a lot of happens is in policy. MUHAMMAD: Yeah, absolutely. I think \u2014 I believe the only way to really affect change in America is to vote people in or out of office \u2014 without being extremely radical, you know. And that is as radical as you can be actually here. And so, we have these moments, I think, in history where people kind of seem like they get it. And I think that there's such a letdown after people are in office and \u2014 I don't know if it's due to politics or that they're really not about transforming that things don't happen. But certainly after seeing the police brutality, which has been going on for a number of years but it's turned up a bit more lately, that I hope that we carry these marches over into the next election, in a great way. STEINBERG: That's even \u2014 in talking again about bringing truth to the history of why it's so dysfunctional between the public and the police. The inception of policing was racist. We policed black people during slavery. That's why police were formed. It wasn't: here's the \"Peace Union\" or the \"Protect You Union.\" It was to police a specific group of people. We've never resolved that. We've never had any healing around it. And so the institution and the process is racist. And you can see it. And maybe in certain cities we've worked through some of it, but we have a lot of work to do with those that are supposed to guard and protect the community and enforce morality. And then, the ideas around blame and punishment \u2014 so that's why I'm so drawn to the law and how we set precedent and policy. So I come back to artists because it is only through artists' voices that we impact these discussions, that we can get radio or -- MUHAMMAD: Do you believe in complete artistic license or do you think that there's a line that should not be crossed? STEINBERG: I'm challenged with that a lot. I think that we violate people just by speaking certain things. And so if in somebody taking license to say whatever they want, they are serving to destruct. I don't think it's OK. That's why I said the Ted Nugent comment. I've been challenged recently because this kid \u2014 white kid, very talented \u2014 ended up in my workshop. Anybody can come to my workshop. It's word-of-mouth. You have to find me. So Rocco \u2014 Rocco Moon is his artist name but Rocco Nugent is his name \u2014 and he's got a lot of talent. He's a great video director and he's a rapper. So it was very hard for me. I'm being honest and talking about this so I guess it's OK cause it is what it is. But I felt my inability to embrace him because of who his father was. Or I felt and still feel \u2014 it's my struggle. I had him come to the law class because he's been bugging me, kind of like the same kind of bugging me Tupac did, \"I want to work with you. I came out here from Texas. Like, Tupac was my --\" And I'm like, \"You're \u2014 you go with your dad and his TV show hunting in Alaska. And I haven't heard you publicly make a statement that says I love you, Dad, but this is not OK.\" So for me, in order to make peace with or embrace Rocco, he has to be able to speak out and his dad is just, you know, not OK. And so, how do you do that? How do we break the cycle? Maybe his son was sent to me. Maybe there's a reason that, you know, he's over with a room full of rappers every week. I mean, that's that deep-rooted years and years \u2014 and I'm getting their kids. And I'm struggling with my own prejudice so -- KELLEY: Well, maybe to ask it from the other side, who do you think is emotionally-educated and how can you hear it in their music? STEINBERG: Oh, I mean, are you just talking about artists or people? KELLEY: Both. STEINBERG: Because there are a leaders that this is their life's work. Oprah spent her life processing her pain so she could be a voice for celebrating and, you know, people are going to see Selma. There are, you know, Deepak, Michael. There are all these people doing the work of emotional education and healing on the planet. There are amazing ministries \u2014 not all but that there are those that do the work. There are a lot of artists now who are still in the mix because they've been able to work through and process their pain, their past, and who they are and what they're doing. We've lost a ton of artists to addiction. We have athletes who, at the top of their game, have fallen apart. And that's that emotional disconnect that \u2014 there's no reason you're in the NFL at the top of your career and you're sitting in jail now fighting murder cases. So we have to examine how people that have everything still go off the cliff. And what is is everything? So then they don't have everything. And that's all I'm saying, is that, from K through 12, we have nothing in formal education that says, \"I need to understand anger. I need to understand temptation. I need to find a path to friendship and to love.\" We need \u2014 and it doesn't have to be mine. I just put something together that really works. And now I need to get it out, whether it's free or whatever it is. That's the next stage of my work is how do I get this process in the hands of every social worker, every teacher, every therapist. Because I spent 25 years examining how to change behavior permanently. And how to break our own internal cycles. And I did it, you know. I had very violent relationships. I was definitely drawn to whatever I could get my dad's attention \u2014 not consciously, but my dad worked in crime. Rap music, the streets. MUHAMMAD: You have so much to say and unfortunately we have another interview that's supposed to be here at three o'clock. And there's so much more that I know Frannie \u2014 she'll speak for herself \u2014 but I'd love to ask you. And hopefully you can come back. Before we do end the interview for now, I want to ask you about your son, Nyku, who I had the pleasure of meeting. And I first experienced him through his video. I can't remember the name of the song. Do you remember \u2014 what song is it?` STEINBERG: \"Traffic.\" MUHAMMAD: \"Traffic.\" STEINBERG: N-Y-K-U. \"Traffic.\" MUHAMMAD: And I was really impressed by that. And it reminded me of the hip-hop that I grew up on, first of all, so to know that he's 15 and making music like that now at this time period was really impressive. How is it raising an up-and-coming MC? STEINBERG: I'm trying to figure it out. We're fighting a lot. That's another area I'm a little hypocritical in. Because if it was anyone else's kid, I would be like, \"Oh, he has it.\" And then because I know the industry, I'm like, \"No. This is not happening.\" And so, what he did was he found somebody that was very interested in him in the industry already that really wants to work with him, had him at Interscope and couple places. And he said he wants me to focus on being his mom. And I can protect him but he really doesn't want to work with me in any kind of business capacity. So it's very interested. I'm thinking about it. I'm very controlling. He's also \u2014 he has so much pain and so much that he's been through. You know, our family's been through a lot. And so, I'm really knowing that he is my son. And I hear it in his lyrics. And he has something special so I want to support Nyku. I think that he does have a gift. But there's \u2014 can I mention one other artist? I just want to say that, like Tupac, I knew instantly. There was no doubt. And when I went to get Earl, it was because I know there's something very special. I usually have the good radar. Actually, I've never been wrong. But I've spent 10 years kind of growing a relationship with the artist Hope. Do you know the artist Hope? MUHAMMAD: No. STEINBERG: She's got \u2014 she's Wayne Shorter's niece, Hope Shorter. And her record is coming. I'm so excited to be part of it. They're going to launch her first song on a platform called Muzooka. It's a new platform that's kind of the answer, like, to iTunes but it's free. I'm not very good with all the platforms. KELLEY: I've heard of it. Yeah. STEINBERG: But Muzooka's going to launch her first single on February 3rd. And you have to listen. Hope's going to change the world with her voice. MUHAMMAD: How can we find her? STEINBERG: You can go to The Artist Hope just to see her old stuff. She's got a lot of stuff that she did, more the acoustic stuff. But you know, when you get that artist that you're like, \"Oh this one has a voice that --\" You've got to to work with her. Hope is amazing. I haven't a heard a voice like hers. It's one of a kind. MUHAMMAD: Wow. STEINBERG: So, for my one plug of the day, I'm really excited about Hope. And so, I think, after \u2014 Earl's record is coming. It's coming. It's very insular. It's like the beginning of his coming into the 21-year-old Earl. MUHAMMAD: That was fast. STEINBERG: That's what I thought. It was so fast. MUHAMMAD: It's just like, wait a second. I just blinked. STEINBERG: Thank you guys for having me. This is awesome. KELLEY: Thank you. MUHAMMAD: Thank you. KELLEY: Thank you for coming. We'll do it again. Really soon.",

Her family made the shelter out of tin and tarps on land where their home stood before a massive earthquake devastated the nation in 2010. An estimated 80,000 Haitians displaced by the quake remain in tents. Monday marks five years since a devastating earthquake struck Haiti, killing more than 200,000 people and destroying much of the Caribbean nation's capital. It is also the deadline for a political showdown. Haitian leaders met late into Sunday night to hash out an agreement and avoid leaving only Haiti's president with legal standing to rule by decree. The prolonged political crisis threatens Haiti's fragile recovery. Carline Lomil was one of the hundreds of thousands of Haitians whose life was irrevocably changed five years ago.

She was 8 months pregnant.

It took him more than 24 hours to make it back home. Like an estimated 1.5 million other people, Lomil and her family had no choice but to move into overcrowded tent camps in Port-au-Prince, with little water, no sewers and high crime. A month into their stay, Lomil gave birth to a baby boy on the floor of the family's cramped, hot tent. Last August, 4 1/2 years after they moved to the tent, police with batons showed up. Lomil was given the equivalent of $500 for rent assistance and forced out. She and her now three children and husband went to the dusty, rocky hillsides outside Port-au-Prince known as Canaan. As many as 300,000 other people moved, too. Some got temporary wooden houses donated by international aid groups; others constructed shelters with whatever they could. The community has no electricity, sewer lines or roads. Lomil lives at an uncle's house for now until she can finish building her nearby house, which she's happy to show off. With her bigger house, Lomil says, she is better off. Displaced by the quake, Carline Lomil and her family now live with a relative in Canaan, in the dusty, rocky hillsides outside Port-au-Prince, while they build their own home nearby. Here, Lomil, who is pregnant, stands in the unfinished house. She works on it whenever they have money.\n                \n                    \n                    Carrie Kahn/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Displaced by the quake, Carline Lomil and her family now live with a relative in Canaan, in the dusty, rocky hillsides outside Port-au-Prince, while they build their own home nearby.

Five years later, the rubble is gone, new roads and business have been built, including major hotel chains, as well as schools and hospitals. The economy got a boost from billions of dollars of foreign aid and investment. Crime and poverty are down. But the recovery has been anything but even \u2014 especially when it comes to housing. An estimated 80,000 people remain in tents. Three-quarters of Port-au-Prince residents live in slums. Peter De Clercq, the U.N.'s humanitarian coordinator in Haiti, says securing land for new development has been a particularly difficult and slow process, since ownership and legal titles were not clear even before the earthquake. \"I think we do have a long way to go, because we are not reconstructing,\" he says. \"In many senses we are actually constructing.\" International aid helped fund Haiti's first modern land registry, which was essential for legal disputes and sales.

But despite progress in some arenas, others have not improved \u2014 for example, Haiti's continual political turmoil. Throughout the weekend, demonstrators marched in the streets, sometimes clashing with police, as lawmakers met late into the night hoping to avert a political crisis and schedule long-overdue elections. Without an agreement, the terms of a majority of lawmakers expire \u2014 leaving only the president left to rule legally, a troubling echo of Haiti's dictatorial past. The U.S. Embassy in Haiti issued a strongly worded statement late Sunday night urging all parties to come to an agreement and schedule elections. Other international officials warned that continual political instability will scare off foreign investors and undermine Haiti's fragile earthquake recovery.",

            "article_content": "Wisconsin Republican Paul Ryan has been elected speaker of the House of Representatives replacing outgoing speaker, John Boehner.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: Now, the passing of the gavel in the House of Representatives today. Wisconsin Republican Paul Ryan is officially the new speaker of the House. His predecessor, John Boehner, resigned rather than face down the hard-line conservatives who wanted to throw him out. Boehner said he leaves the house with no regrets. Here's NPR congressional reporter Susan Davis. SUSAN DAVIS, BYLINE: As he stood in the well of the House, Speaker John Boehner reached for his handy box of tissues before he addressed his colleagues for the last time. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JOHN BOEHNER: I rise today to inform you that I will resign as speaker of the House effective upon the election of my successor. DAVIS: A sometimes tearful Boehner reminded a cantankerous House, the change in Washington is slow and incremental. And that, he says, is a good thing. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BOEHNER: So believe in the long, slow struggle. Believe in this country's ability to meet her challenges and to lead the world. And remember, you can't do a big job alone, especially this one. DAVIS: Boehner's big job now goes to a man who was a college student when he volunteered for Boehner's first congressional campaign back in 1990. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BOEHNER: He was putting up campaign signs for me. His name is Paul Ryan. DAVIS: Paul Ryan did not volunteer to be Speaker. He was pressured to take the job when it became clear he was the only candidate nearly all House Republicans could vote for. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BOEHNER: There's a difference between being asked to do something and being called to do something. Paul is being called. DAVIS: That call now requires Ryan to reach a delicate balance. He must ease conservative frustration over how the House does business and, at the same time, find compromise with President Obama and congressional Democrats. In keeping with House tradition, minority leader Nancy Pelosi handed him the gavel. She then extended her hand to Ryan. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) NANCY PELOSI: Today in this House, a page is turned. A new chapter has begun. DAVIS: For Ryan, that new chapter begins with an understanding of the same responsibility Boehner felt to the institution, not just to the Republican Party. Ryan took a moment on this ceremonial day to reflect on that new responsibility. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PAUL RYAN: It's not until you hold this gavel, stand in this spot, look out and see all 435 members of this House as if all America is sitting right in front of you - it's not till then that you feel it - the weight of responsibility, the gravity of the moment. DAVIS: This moment, Ryan said, begins with moving past the petty spats that have made it hard for Republicans to advance a legislative agenda. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) RYAN: But let's be frank. The House is broken. We're not solving problems. We're adding to them, and I am not interested in laying blame. We are not settling scores. We are wiping the slate clean. DAVIS: For his part, Ryan pledged to be less top-down and more collaborative. He appealed to all lawmakers to move past the in-fighting and focus that energy on easing the financial struggles of Americans. He says they're tired of hearing about Washington dysfunction. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) RYAN: They look at Washington, and all they see is chaos. What a relief to them it would be if we finally got our acts together - what a weight off of their shoulders. DAVIS: Ryan said in order to do that, Congress should prioritize, among other things, overhauling the tax code, eliminating poverty and paying down the national debt.

Donald Trump's summer of defying political gravity is continuing, despite predictions that various missteps would damage him. Instead, he has surged even more after his controversial Fox News debate performance. But who exactly are the people backing the boisterous billionaire businessman? Some recent polls offer a glimpse into the Trump coalition, which may run strong within a certain section of the GOP but faces many hurdles when it comes to a general election. Trump's base may be working-class white men, who find Trump's straightforward style and nonpolitician approach refreshing, according to recent surveys and focus groups. In last month's NBC News-Wall Street Journal poll, Trump did well among nearly every subset of the Republican Party. He registered highest with voters without a college degree. He also performed strongly among men. They viewed him very positively. He was most well-liked by Tea Party supporters and those who regularly listen to conservative talk radio. \"The groups that he's doing well with are very often the core of the Republican Party's primary electorate, which is why he's not taking much incoming attacks from his fellow competitors,\" said Lee Miringoff, director of Marist University's polling operation, which conducts state-based surveys for NBC News. Because of that, Miringoff said, don't expect Trump to fade anytime soon. \"Those who thought this was a summer romance that would vanish when school returns are probably mistaken,\" he said. \"This is very real. He's tapped into a lot of sentiment about the anger and frustration that people have, which is not new. But he's seen as a straight shooter, and he doesn't hold his punches. That seems to resonate with a lot of people.\" Lanae Erickson Hatalsky, director of social policy and politics at Third Way, said she saw that dynamic on full display in recent focus groups the centrist Washington think tank conducted among swing and independent voters. \"The only presidential candidate whose name crossed their lips has been Donald Trump,\" Hatalsky said. \"The level of vitriol toward money and politics seems to be at a fevered pitch among every swing subset. All of them seem to think that Donald Trump is an answer to getting money out of politics. They thought he can't be bought.\" Their focus groups in Northern Virginia, Las Vegas, Milwaukee and Des Moines, Iowa, were separated by gender and included mostly white, middle-class swing voters. Hatalsky said it was evident the men were much more fervent in liking Trump, saying they, too, believed that being too politically correct was a major problem in the U.S. \"It's not just that he says whatever he wants, which is refreshing to them,\" Hatalsky said. \"He's parroting that problem for them and saying aloud the diagnosis. Independent men really talked about a sense of being almost muzzled in lots of areas of their life. It was cathartic for them being able to watch Trump speak his mind about whatever he wants.\" Seventy-two-year-old Franklyn Patrick Farnham came from nearby Massachusetts to attend a town hall Trump held in New Hampshire on Wednesday night, even though he can't vote in the first-in-the-nation primary. He told NPR's Asma Khalid he's excited about a Trump bid because he's \"guileless.\" \"I'm totally behind Donald Trump because he's not a politician,\" Farnham said. He's not a Washington bureaucrat; he doesn't come out of Obama's sneaky White House. He's clean, and he's free. He doesn't need this; he's one of the wealthiest men in the country, but he sees what's going on in the country and he wants to save it.\" Elena Abbene, a conservative Tea Party voter from Bedford, N.H., told NPR's Khalid it's that gusto that has her leaning toward Trump. \"He's not afraid to say what everybody's feeling and afraid to say,\" Abbene said. \"He doesn't have a filter.\" But while Trump may be peaking in those areas among Republicans, he may have a much harder time continuing that appeal in a general election \u2014 if he were to get that far. Trump has the highest unfavorable ratings of any 2016 candidate, Democrat or Republican. While he performs best among white men and white, working-class voters, he has high negatives with minority voters. And even among white men, he has a 13-point net-negative rating; among the white working class, he's a 4-point net-negative. Compare that to black voters, who rate him 60 percentage points more negatively than positively, and Hispanics, who give him an even worse 62-point net-negative rating. Trump also performs poorly among voters who have a postgraduate degree. He does best with voters who finished high school or less. Miringoff agreed that while the general election trend may be troubling for Trump, he still has the edge in the GOP primary \u2014 and that may not be fading anytime soon. Meanwhile, Trump will continue to campaign in his trademark unorthodox style that still befuddles many political observers. \"Take the campaign consultant book out and shred it,\" Miringoff said. \"He's doing very little by the rules by the way of campaign strategy.\"",

This story is part of NPR's series Journey Home. We're going to the places presidential candidates call home and finding out what those places tell us about how they see the world. Few presidential candidates go around invoking Richard Nixon. But that's exactly what GOP hopeful John Kasich does. It all goes back to a complaint Kasich had about his dorm room and a meeting with a university president 45 years ago. Kasich is nothing if not persistent. He was a kid from the working class McKees Rocks, Pa., but he went to college at Ohio State University, and that's where he kicked off his presidential campaign this summer. OSU football legend and two-time Heisman trophy winner Archie Griffin warmed up the crowd at Kasich's campaign launch. He led a cheer that anyone who's attended a Buckeye football game knows \u2014 Griffin shouted \"O-H\" and the crowd replied with a loud \"I-O.\" Moments later, Kasich was onstage at his alma mater and reminiscing about his old dormitory. \"I came here to Ohio State,\" he said. \"I found myself on the 19th floor of one of those towers. You could hit it with a stone from here. The place was 23 floors high. The tower next door the same size. Ohio State can be a pretty intimidating place.\" But Kasich the student was anything but intimidated. There's one tale from back then that's become a campaign staple for him. As a college freshman, he had some complaints about that high-rise dormitory, including a rule forbidding residents from opening the windows. He says he got nowhere with housing officials, \"so I called the President's Office and started badgering them until they finally let me in.\" As a college student, Kasich wrote to Nixon calling him \"not only a great president but an even greater person\" and asking to visit the president in Washington. Nixon obliged.\n                \n\n                    White House\n                    \n\nhide caption As a college student, Kasich wrote to Nixon calling him \"not only a great president but an even greater person\" and asking to visit the president in Washington. Nixon obliged. The university president in that fall of 1970 was Novice Fawcett. Kasich says he immediately took notice of the nice desk, the leather upholstered chairs, the beautiful rugs. And after raising his complaints, he asked what exactly a college president does. Fawcett noted his academic and fundraising responsibilities --then he mentioned something else. \"He says, 'Tomorrow I'm going to go down and visit with President Nixon. And I said 'Well sir, there's a number of things that I would like to talk to him about also do you think I could go with you?' And he said 'No, you can't go.'\" But Kasich \u2014 quick on his feet \u2014 asked if Fawcett would deliver a letter to Nixon for him. \"And he said, 'Well, I guess I could do that.'\" Kasich wrote the letter, praising Nixon as \"not only a great president but an even greater person.\" He asked to come visit him in Washington. Days later, there was a letter in his dormitory mailbox \u2014 from President Nixon himself. Kasich immediately called his parents. Whatever your own political views are or your views of him personally you have to admire his ability to set a goal and make it happen. David Leland \"My mother answers the phone and I said, 'Mom, I'm going to need an airline ticket, the president of the United States would like to have a meeting with me in the Oval Office,'\" Kasich recounted. \"And my mother is shouting 'Honey, pick up the phone there's something really wrong with Johnny.'\" In the official White House photo of Kasich in the Oval Office he looks even younger than his 18 years as he shakes Nixon's hand. Both are smiling. It's dated Dec. 22, 1970. There's no telling exactly what they talked about because there aren't any notes detailing the conversation. And it was just two months before Nixon's infamous Oval Office taping system was installed. Back at Ohio State, Kasich's friends and acquaintances all heard the story --over and over. John Kasich announced his presidential bid in July at Ohio State University, where he went to college.\n                \n                    \n                    Don Gonyea/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption John Kasich announced his presidential bid in July at Ohio State University, where he went to college. \"Yeah we all heard about it,\" said David Leland, who was a student at the time. \"We viewed it as sort of weird, OK? Because Nixon wasn't exactly a figure that was admired on the campus of Ohio State at that particular time.\" It was the era of Vietnam war protests and the draft. But Kasich was a proud and vocal Republican. Leland, meanwhile, was and is a Democat. He's currently a state lawmaker in Ohio and a Hillary Clinton supporter. But he says he's glad Kasich is in the race on the GOP side. As for that moment from the highlight reel of Kasich's college days, Leland adds this: \"You gotta admire the guy's guts and his ability to do what he wants to do. I mean whatever your own political views are or your views of him personally you have to admire his ability to set a goal and make it happen. And that's what he did in that particular case and that's pretty much what he's done throughout his life.\" Now, there is one other detail worth noting from that Oval Office moment 45 years ago this month. Kasich recalls that he was told he'd have exactly five minutes with Nixon. \"I'll tell you what I'm thinking: I got new jacket, new shirt, new tie, new pants. I'm not coming out in five lousy minutes,\" he said. \"They're out of luck.\" White House logs from that day show the meeting starting at 12:31 p.m. \u2014 and ending at 12:51 p.m. Twenty minutes. It's easy to see that same persistent, pushy kid in the now 63-year-old John Kasich. Except this time he's looking to actually move into the White House.",

            "article_content": "As France heads into important regional elections on Sunday, the far right party is on the threshold of gaining power in one or more regions of France for the first time in history.  AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: In France, mainstream political parties are alarmed over the success of the far-right in regional elections underway. In some regions, the National Front took more than 40 percent of the vote Sunday, and the party could take control of those regions after the second round of voting this Sunday. NPR's Eleanor Beardsley sends this report from Marseille. ELEANOR BEARDSLEY, BYLINE: Customers gather around a fish stall in the bustling port city of Marseille. Oysters, shrimp and glassy-eyed fish are laid out on ice. This is France's second-largest city. Around a quarter of the population is Muslim, and it's a stronghold of the far-right. Retiree Bernadette Gira, who used to vote for the mainstream right, says she'll be thrilled if the National Front takes this region on Sunday. BERNADETTE GIRA: (Through interpreter) We are sick of the socialists and the conservatives. They just change back and forth between each other, and nothing changes. So why not try something new? I would like for things to be like they used to be, when people could go out in the street and feel secure and earn a good living. BEARDSLEY: Gira says if Hollande had been doing his job, France wouldn't have been attacked by terrorists last month. Briac de Musset is behind the counter. The young fishmonger says he's also open to trying the National Front. BRIAC DE MUSSET: (Through interpreter) The traditional political parties aren't interested in the working-class, or even the middle class, really. They're just using them to continue their bourgeois politics and stay in power. BEARDSLEY: The National Front came in first place among French blue-collar workers last weekend. The French far-right advocates strong worker protections, long-term unemployment benefits and a nationalist trade policy. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MARION MARECHAL-LE PEN: (Speaking French). BEARDSLEY: Speaking at a rally this week in Marseille, the National Front's main candidate for this region, Marion Marechal-Le Pen, outlined her program of patriotic protection for local companies. She won applause when she denigrated multinational corporations. The 26-year-old politician is the granddaughter of the National Front's founder, Jean-Marie Le Pen. It was her aunt, current party leader Marine Le Pen, who transformed the National Front from a fringe party of the extreme-right to a real political alternative for many French voters. NONNA MAYER: The idea that the right was in office, the left was in office, they govern together, and look, they haven't managed to solve the problem number one, which is not terrorists, which is unemployment. So she is surfing on that wave of anti-elite, anti-terrorism, anti-immigrants mood, and she's done it very skillfully. EVA TAHLA: (Speaking French). BEARDSLEY: Eva Tahla was a socialist candidate from Marseille's regional council, but her party did so poorly in first-round voting last Sunday that it's dropped out of the election altogether and is asking its supporters to back mainstream conservative candidates and block the National Front. Twenty-six-year-old Tahla says she's particularly concerned by young people who support Le Pen. TAHLA: (Through interpreter) This generation is really hit by unemployment. Young people are looking for answers. We've had the left and the right in power and still haven't found any. BEARDSLEY: Tahla says, in 1968, disillusioned French students revolted and turned to the left. Today, she says, young people are either apathetic or falling into the embrace of the far-right.

Critics say Macri's privileged background puts him out of touch with the working class. SANTIAGO RESNIK: I think that what we achieve will be lost if Macri wins. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Santiago Resnik is also in his 20s, and he wants Daniel Scioli to win. Scioli is the former governor of Buenos Aires province. And he's also a sporting man, a one-time speedboat champion who lost his arm in a boating accident. He's the anointed successor of Cristina Kirchner, and he's pledged continuity, including keeping generous spending on social programs. What's at stake is Latin America's third-largest economy says Matteus Carugatti with think tank Management and Fit. MATTEUS CARUGATTI: We have an economy that hasn't grown in four years with high inflation. The poverty rate is still at the same level as it was in 2011. So we have poor results in terms of economic performance. GARCIA-NAVARRO: The economist says regardless of the new president's political leanings, there are some difficult measures in the cards. CARUGATTI: Devaluation is one of them; another, a cut in subsidies to energy and transportation. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Which will affect the currency and the cost of living here. This election also matters to the United States. Julia Pomares is from CIPPEC, another think tank, and she says sitting President Cristina Kirchner has been in opposition to much of American foreign policy in the region, especially in regards to difficult issues like the leftist leadership of Venezuela. If Macri wins, he has already signaled there will be a shift in the relationship. JULIA POMARES: I think in many ways he will be a better ally, so it will be a very interesting situation to see. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Latin America is watching these elections closely, too. A right-of-center president governing in Argentina could be the first sign that the wave of leftist leaders in Latin America that rose to power over a decade ago could be falling out of favor. What was called the Pink Tide may be washing out to sea. If the polls are right and Macri wins, Argentina and Latin America, come Monday, could start to look very different.

            "article_content": "Saudi Arabia will soon hold the first municipal elections in which women can both vote and run for office. More than 900 women are vying for seats across the country. Voter registration is very low.  LINDA WERTHEIMER, HOST: Saudi Arabia is taking a limited step towards democracy next month. For the first time, women can vote and run for office in municipal elections. More than 900 women are vying for seats across the country. But voter registration for women and men is very low. NPR's Deborah Amos is in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, and joins us now. Good morning, Deb. DEBORAH AMOS, BYLINE: Good morning. WERTHEIMER: Now, campaigning started this week for an election next week. Could you describe what this looks like, Saudi's first campaign that includes women? AMOS: Well, let me say this, that no one expected so many women who run. You know, women don't really have a public role here. And it wasn't easy to sign up. It wasn't easy to register to vote. But still, this is Saudi Arabia. So there's lots of restrictions - no pictures on campaign literature. Women can't use social media to reach out to the voters. And they can't talk to men when they're campaigning. Three women candidates were barred from running, no reason given. But all three are well-known activists who challenge the government's ban on women driving. WERTHEIMER: So is this a breakthrough for Saudi women, a change for the kingdom's conservative society? AMOS: There's been differences of opinion on that. The odds are stacked against any of them winning. You know, voter registration for women is very low. It's about 136,000 compared to 1.2 million men who registered to vote. But there are others, like Fawzia al-Bakr. She's a professor, a writer. She was one of the first to register. And for her, it's the process that matters. And you can hear the excitement in her voice. FAWZIA AL-BAKR: At least we're there (laughter). I mean, you know, at least we're going there. And I think we have no choice. We just have to get, you know, step-by-step toward more - you know, more participation and more democratic, you know, representation of the people. I think most of our population is young, well-educated - actually - we have no choice. AMOS: That's Fawzia al-Bakr. And she's part of this growing number of educated working women. And if you add to that a powerful business community, that's the lobby for modernization and political liberalization. WERTHEIMER: The election comes in turbulent times for Saudi Arabia. There are wars across almost every Saudi border, and oil prices are at an all-time low. How does that background play into this limited step towards democracy? AMOS: The Saudis are locked in a war with Yemen. And they're in a regional competition with Iran. So at the same time, Saudi Arabia's deputy crown prince - this is the 30-year-old son of King Salman -he's overseeing an overhaul of the economy. It's a belt tightening because of these low oil prices. So for the first time, Saudi Arabia will impose a tax. They've never done it before - 2.5 percent a year on undeveloped land. There's a housing crisis here. There's lots of undeveloped land. There's also a plan to cut government subsidies here. Gasoline is cheaper than bottled water. Electricity costs almost nothing. But it costs the government billions. And they just can't afford it. So this is a new era for the kingdom. WERTHEIMER: And how do Saudis feel about belt tightening? This is a country that's always been one of the richest places on Earth. AMOS: It's a new compact between the rulers and the ruled. You know, with social media here, Saudis are more aware than ever of just how the government spends that money. There's poverty here. There's struggle in the middle class. You really need a two-income family to keep up. So there is going to be grumbling. This limited move to open up the political process is part of giving people a say. But the royal family still controls all of the important levers of power. So here's the question. This election is for seats on a local council that has very little power. So is that enough of a voice in these troubled times? WERTHEIMER: That's NPR's Deb Amos, reporting from Riyadh in Saudi Arabia. Deb, thank you. AMOS: Thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2015 NPR.

            "article_content": "Socialism is a dirty word for most Americans. But democratic socialist is a label Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders wears proudly. On Thursday, he explained what it means to him.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: Bernie Sanders describes himself as a democratic socialist. He's been using that label for decades. But Sanders is a contender in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination. So today, he gave a big speech to explain what democratic socialism means to him. NPR's Tamara Keith reports. TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: In a packed auditorium at Georgetown University, Bernie Sanders drew heavily on the examples of Martin Luther King Jr. and Franklin Delano Roosevelt, the president behind the New Deal. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BERNIE SANDERS: And by the way, almost everything he proposed, almost every program, every idea he introduced was called socialist. (CHEERING) SANDERS: I thought I would mention that just in passing. (LAUGHTER) KEITH: You see, Bernie Sanders was trying to de-weaponize socialism, a term that has been used in America with negative connotations for generations. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) SANDERS: Real freedom must include economic security. That was Roosevelt's vision 70 years ago. It is my vision today. It is a vision that we have not yet achieved, and it is time we that we did. KEITH: Sanders then went through a litany of proposals that are at the heart of his campaign - Medicare for all, tuition-free public college, a $15 minimum wage. These are ideas intended to help America's poor and middle class. But they don't exactly fit the dictionary definition of socialism. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) SANDERS: So the next time that you hear me attacked as a socialist, like tomorrow... (LAUGHTER) SANDERS: ...Remember this. I don't believe government should take over, you know, the grocery store down the street or own the means of production. KEITH: Toward the end, Sanders turned to foreign policy. In light of the attacks in Paris, in many ways this big speech about democratic socialism was overtaken by events. Sanders said he isn't a pacifist, but unilateral force should be a last resort. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) SANDERS: Countering violent extremism and destroying ISIS must be done primarily by Muslim nations with the strong support of their global partners. KEITH: After the speech, Sanders took questions. And the first one was about socialism - why he keeps using the term even if it doesn't really fit what he's advocating. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) SANDERS: When I use the word socialist - and I know some people are uncomfortable about it - I say that it is imperative that we create a political revolution, that millions of people get involved in the political process and that we create a government that works for all, not just the few. KEITH: Sanders said people are angry. They're working and earning less. And he hopes that anger will fuel a revolution. Tamara Keith, NPR News, Washington. Copyright \u00a9 2015 NPR.

            "article_content": "People remove household goods from the rubble as a house burns on Sunday in Sinjar, Iraq. Kurdish forces, with the aid of months of U.S.-led coalition airstrikes, liberated the town from ISIS.\n                \n                    \n                    John Moore/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption People remove household goods from the rubble as a house burns on Sunday in Sinjar, Iraq. Kurdish forces, with the aid of months of U.S.-led coalition airstrikes, liberated the town from ISIS. This post was updated at 9:23 p.m. ET The next president will have to make some very big decisions about how to combat terrorism. Paris, Beirut and the bombing of a Russian jetliner make that abundantly clear, 14 years after Sept. 11, the worst terrorist attacks on American soil. To listen to the presidential candidates, however, is to listen to two very distinctly different worldviews. President Obama warned Monday against sending ground troops into Syria and Iraq to fight ISIS. He argued that while American troops could clear and hold any area, unless Americans are \"prepared for a permanent occupation,\" then it would be a fool's errand. Obama, who has called for bringing in 10,000 Syrian refugees \u2014 after screenings \u2014 also argued for keeping doors open to those fleeing terrorism. \"Slamming the door in their faces would be a betrayal of our values,\" he said at the G-20 Summit in Turkey. He also forcefully criticized, without saying their names, Republicans like Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who the president said would like to implement a \"religious test\" for refugees. It all sets up thorny issues to be debated during the next year about national security and the two parties' approaches. Americans will have to decide, in this post-Iraq War world, between which approach they believe is best to deal with terrorism and the fully emerged threat of ISIS. On one side, similar to Obama's view, is a continued pursuit of multilateralism, a reluctance to use ground troops and a relative openness to refugees and immigrants. On the other is a return to a more hawkish role as the clear world leader, more willing to intervene in conflicts and more protectionist. There's also the role of surveillance, domestic and foreign, and getting private companies, like Apple, to allow the U.S. government access. That will almost certainly become a central theme in the discussions around what to do about ISIS. The debate crosses party lines. Liberals on the left and libertarians on the right argue in favor of privacy. Democratic centrists are sensitive to that debate, but are against totally shutting down NSA programs. And Republican hawks strongly support using all of the tools at the government's disposal. Jeb Bush argued immediately after the attacks essentially that the NSA's hands shouldn't be tied. It's a subject Hillary Clinton has struggled with. In February, she called for more \"transparency\" from the NSA but waffled on what its role should be. \"How much is too much? And how much is not enough? That's the hard part,\" she said. \"I think if Americans felt like, No. 1, you're not going after my personal information, the content of my personal information. But I do want you to get the bad guys, because I don't want them to use social media, to use communications devices invented right here to plot against us. So let's draw the line. And I think it's hard if everybody's in their corner. So I resist saying it has to be this or that. I want us to come to a better balance.\" Three months later, she came out in favor of a bill that ended the NSA's bulk data collection program endorsed by the White House. President Obama's approval on foreign policy has nosedived since the rise of ISIS and his previous dismissal of the group as a \"JV\" version of al-Qaida. Just 32 percent approved of his handling of foreign policy in a September NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll. That, and more than a decade of wars after Sept. 11, set the backdrop of this election. Here's what candidates from both parties have laid out over the past few days since the Paris attacks Friday. Democrats have wanted to talk about kitchen-table economic issues. Those had been dominating the Democratic side of the primary to this point. Even at Saturday night's debate, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders quickly pivoted to economic issues away from France in his opening remarks. And while the Paris attacks came up at Democratic-candidate events this weekend, they mostly focused on their stump speeches. NPR's Tamara Keith reports that Clinton, for example, spent 2 1/2 minutes on Paris and then pivoted. \"I am the only one who won't raise middle-class taxes,\" she said, an implicit shot at Sanders. The Democratic positions Saturday on what to do about ISIS exposed only minor cleavages compared with the gulf between them and Republicans. Here's a summary of the Democrats' positions from that night, plus the Obama administration's view: President Obama The president launched U.S. airstrikes against ISIS in Iraq in 2014, which later extended into Syria. Those airstrikes have been supported to a limited extent by Arab allies, including Jordan, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates, as well as France, Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. U.S. military advisers have been on the ground assisting Iraqi forces, and recently up to 50 American special operations forces were authorized to fight inside Syria. In terms of other troops on the ground, Obama's approach has been to equip the Kurds and moderate forces in Syria. At the G-20 meeting in Turkey over the past couple of days, he was seeking \"additional contributions\" from allies to \"bring more force to bear,\" per White House foreign policy adviser Ben Rhodes speaking on NBC's Meet the Press Sunday. Bernie Sanders Lead the world and beat ISIS, though he abandoned the topic two sentences into his opening remarks. He noted climate change is directly related to the growth of terrorism, tried to use Iraq against Clinton and said the bulk of the responsibility for the growth of ISIS is the U.S.'s because of Iraq. He said the U.S. needs to lead an international coalition, particularly of Muslim nations that should \"fight and defend their way of life.\" He called for them to get their hands \"dirty\" and for them to put boots on the ground. Sanders went so far as to call it a \"war for the soul of Islam.\" He reiterated that the U.S., U.K. and France should support, but was critical of Muslim countries that he said have not led. He spoke against U.S.-led regime changes in Latin America. But he again came back to a coalition with American leadership to \"destroy\" ISIS. He noted the U.S. should bring in refugees, pointed to changing warfare, and is not in favor of sending in American troops. Clinton She had some stronger language off the top, noting the need for \"resolve\" and to bring the world together. She said allies needed to better coordinate and took an implicit shot at President Obama, saying ISIS needed to be defeated, not contained. She also took aim at Sanders indirectly, saying that all other issues are dependent on being safe. She said she supports military use only as a last resort and that the U.S. needs to use diplomacy, development aid, law enforcement and intelligence coordination. She is in favor of using special ops, but in a \"support\" role. She had a flub when she said, \"This cannot be an American fight.\" That drew criticism from Democratic Gov. Martin O'Malley onstage with her \u2014 and the right. She said American \"leadership,\" though, was essential. She walked back the \"not an American fight\" line later in the weekend in the face of criticism, saying the U.S. has to be rallying partners and allies and pulling countries off the sidelines. She tried to put some space between herself and President Obama by also harkening back to her favoring of training and equipping moderate fighters in Syria. She swatted at Sanders, telling him that \"jihadi\" terrorism existed before Sept. 11 to combat the idea that Iraq caused all of what's being seen today. She said it was more complex than Sanders and O'Malley were making it out to be onstage. She argued that people in the region need to be given a better way of life. She disagreed, in part, with Sanders on Muslim countries. She said he was being unfair to Jordan, which she said has taken risk for U.S. on refugees and more. But she agreed that Turkey and Gulf countries need to \"make up their mind\" about which side they're on and commit. She said there needs to be a whole government approach, including aid. She said she preferred the term jihadi extremism instead of \"Islamic terrorism,\" which Republicans are calling for, because it is not helpful to say radical Islam if the U.S. is going to reach out to Muslim countries and try to get them off the sidelines. She said the term Republicans want used opens up the U.S. to accusations that it is using \"shortcut\" language to say the U.S. is at war with Islam. She noted that George W. Bush made it a point to say the U.S. wasn't at war with a religion but with \"evil.\" She said post-Sept. 11 military force authorization covers presidential action but that a president should go through Congress. On refugees, she would go higher than President Obama, from 10,000 to 65,000, but only with careful screening, warning not to allow people in who could harm the U.S. She disagreed with the implication from O'Malley and Sanders that U.S. should fight differently or without Marines, as O'Malley suggested, advocating for a strong but streamlined defense. O'Malley Collaborate, anticipate threats and lead world. It is America's fight, he told Clinton, but that the U.S. needs to pursue a multilateral approach. He stressed support for human intelligence. (Whether to emphasize HUMINT or tech surveillance is a decades-long CIA internal debate.) He stressed human intelligence despite repeatedly pointing out that the this is a 21st century fight. He, too, chose \"radical jihadis\" as his term. And he would go to 65,000 refugees, something he says he was first to call for. (Fifteen Senate Democrats wrote a letter encouraging Obama to bring in that number in September.) He is not in favor of sending in Marines or traditional ground troops. Terrorism and foreign policy have been a top issue for Republican primary voters for nearly a year following high-profile acts of brutality from ISIS, including the video of a journalist's beheading. It was clear after that, the hawks were back in the GOP. To varying degrees, Republicans are proposing declarations of war, invoking NATO's Article 5 (which says that an attack on one is an attack on all), stopping any plans to bring in Syrian refugees and focusing on Christians, air power and no-fly zones; using the words \"radical Islamic terrorism.\" Some want ground troops. Donald Trump wants to \"watch and study the mosques,\" and he blamed a lack of guns in France for the attacks. Because there are so many GOP candidates, below is some of what they said, by topic, in response to ISIS: Article 5/Declare War Marco Rubio: \"First, I would ask our allies to invoke Article 5. This is clearly an act of war and an attack on one of our NATO allies. And we should invoke Article 5 of the NATO agreement, and bring everyone together to put together a coalition to confront this challenge.\" Bush: \"We should declare war and harness all of the power that the United States can bring to bear both diplomatic and military, of course, to be able to take out ISIS. We have the capabilities of doing this, we just haven't shown the will.\" John Kasich: \"If the U.S. were to continue to lead from behind, we will leave the world a much more dangerous place. ... Just as France did for us in aftermath of the infamous 9/11 attacks, we should invoke Article 5, the mutual defense clause, of the North Atlantic Treaty.\" Refugees Several candidates have said the U.S. should halt plans to bring in refugees from Syria. Rubio: \"We won't be able to take more refugees. It's not that we don't want to; it's that we can't. Because there's no way to background-check someone that's coming from Syria. Who do you call and do a background check on them?\" Bush on CNN: \"We should focus our efforts as it relates to refugees on the Christians that are being slaughtered.\" On Meet the Press, he said the U.S. had a \"responsibility\" to help refugees, but \"focus ought to be on the Christians who have no place in Syria anymore.\" Ted Cruz: \"There is no meaningful risk of Christians committing acts of terror. If there were a group of radical Christians pledging to murder anyone who had a different religious view than they, we would have a different national security situation.\" Lindsey Graham has said he would accept Syrian refugees. Pressed on it on CNN Sunday, he demurred, saying, \"The good people are leaving because they're being raped and murdered and some terrorists are trying to get in their ranks.\" But Monday afternoon, he called for a \"timeout\" on bringing in refugees. Trump has said if he's president he will force out Syrian refugees already in the U.S. \"We all have heart, and we all want people taken care of and all of that, but with the problems our country has, to take in 250,000 people \u2014 some of whom are going to have problems, big problems \u2014 is just insane. You have to be insane. Terrible.\" (Obama announced accepting 10,000, not 250,000.) Ben Carson said bringing in Syrian refugees would be a \"huge mistake.\" \"Because why wouldn't they infiltrate them with people who are ideologically opposed to us?\" he asked rhetorically on Fox News Sunday. \"It would be foolish for them not to do that.\" He added the U.S. needs to be \"compassionate\" and should resettle them \"over there ... but to bring them here, under these circumstances, is a suspension of intellect.\" Then he said this: \"You know, the reason that the human brain has these big frontal lobes as opposed to other animals, because we can engage in rational thought processing, we can, you know, extract information from the past, the present, process it and project it into a plan. Animals, on the other hand, have big brain stems and rudimentary things, because they react. We don't have to just react, we can think.\" No-Fly Zone/Shooting Down Russian Planes Multiple candidates have advocated no-fly zones and even shooting down Russian planes if they violated it. (Hillary Clinton endorsed a no-fly zone last month to create \"humanitarian corridors.\") Of Republicans, Bush, Carson, Chris Christie, Carly Fiorina, Graham, Kasich and Rubio have all endorsed no-fly zones. Graham: \"The best thing the world could do for Syrian people is to create a safe haven within Syria, a no-fly zone.\" Carson suggested shooting down a Russian plane if it violated a U.S.-enforced no-fly zone. \"If they violate it, we will, in fact, enforce it. We'll see what happens. For us to always be backing down because we're afraid of a conflict, that's not how we became a great nation, Chris,\" he told Chris Wallace on Fox News Sunday. Christie has said he would shoot down a Russian jet if it violated the airspace, and Rubio also made that suggestion a month ago. \"If you are going to have a no-fly zone, it has to be against anyone who would dare intrude on it,\" Rubio said on CNBC Oct. 5. \"And I am confident that the United States Air Force can enforce that, including against the Russians. That I believe the Russians would not test that. I don't think it's in the Russians' interest to engage in an armed conflict with the United States.\" Rand Paul is against a no-fly zone. Say 'Radical Islamic Terrorism' Cruz: \"As long as we have a commander in chief unwilling even to utter the words 'radical Islamic terrorism,' we will not have a concerted effort to defeat these radicals before they continue to murder more and more innocents.\" Rubio said he didn't get why Clinton wouldn't say it. \"I don't understand it. That would be like saying we were not at war with Nazis because we were afraid to offend some Germans who may have been members of the Nazi Party but weren't violent themselves.\" Bush: \"This is not a question of religion. This is a political ideology that has co-opted a religion, and I think it's more than acceptable to call it for what it is and then organize an effort to destroy it.\" Trump tweeted: \"When will President Obama issue the words RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM? He can't say it, and unless he will, the problem will not be solved!\" Ground Troops Americans have been split on sending ground troops to fight ISIS. A Quinnipiac poll from August found a narrow majority in support of that, but with major ideological splits \u2014 73 percent of Republicans were in favor, but just 37 percent of Democrats. That might help explain why no Democrats have proposed sending in ground forces and a handful of Republicans either have or have expressed openness to doing so. Graham, Rick Santorum, Kasich, Bobby Jindal, Bush, Trump and Carson have said they are in favor of ground troops to one degree or another (or in Carson's view \u2014 \"probably\"). Graham and Santorum have been the most forthright on using ground troops as a strategy. Kasich said they'd be needed. Jindal would do it if the military recommended it. Bush said on Meet the Press he'd \"absolutely\" be in favor of \"boots on the ground\" in Syria and said that the U.S. \"can't do it alone ... but we need to lead.\" He also would continue to advocate getting rid of Bashar Assad, fight ISIS at same time and build up the Free Syrian Army. Trump, when pressed on MSNBC's Morning Joe, said he'd be in favor of 10,000 troops but would encourage Persian Gulf States to put \"more skin in the game.\" Carson said Friday \"boots on the ground would probably be important,\" but then told Chris Wallace on Fox News Sunday, \"[F]or me to pretend like I have all of that knowledge and the ability to formulate all the specific plans and how to do it, I think is foolish, and I think anybody else who thinks they know it all is foolish also.\" Cruz said Kurds should be used \"as our boots on the ground.\" French Guns Trump Saturday in Texas: \"You can say what you want, but if they had guns \u2014 if our people had guns, if they were allowed to carry \u2014 it would have been a much, much different situation.\"",

Hillary Clinton laid out some lofty goals for her presidency in a speech on Friday. \"My mission from my first day as president to the last will be to raise the incomes of hardworking Americans so they can once again afford a middle-class life,\" she said. \"This is the defining economic challenge not only of this election but our time.\" So, she has her work cut out for her. But interestingly, that line came not from a populist barn burner of a speech, but from a policy-focused address about ending \"quarterly capitalism\" \u2014 the tendency for businesses to focus on short-term shareholder gains over long-term investment. The wonkier bits of her speech about capital-gains taxation might only interest a specific subset of people, but she couched them to attract a much broader audience of voters angered by what they see as an unfair economic system. Democrats and Republicans alike are trying to channel that anger, but are offering very different solutions \u2014 so much so that the leading candidates for both parties seem to be living in two economic realities. Voters are frustrated by a range of economic issues: inequality, stagnant incomes and debt, to name a few. That frustration is the driving narrative of the 2016 election, as candidates try to convince voters that they can forge an economy that won't make Americans feel stuck in neutral. Americans have barely seen their pay outpace inflation since the recession. Annual wage growth has been stuck at around 2 percent since 2009, and median household incomes are where they were in 1995. But that's not all that's wrong: Faith in the American Dream has dipped. In the late 1990s, 74 percent of Americans thought hard work was the way to get ahead in America. By January 2014, it was 60 percent. And since the recession, most Americans just haven't felt \u2014 for more than a handful of weeks at a time, anyway \u2014 that the economy is getting better. Politicians, of course, have taken notice. Indeed, to win any national election, they simply have to. \"The longer we're kind of stuck in this rut of stagnating incomes and very low wage growth and a lot of slack in the labor market, the more people feel like this is just the way things are, and the less space there is for politicians to say, 'OK, well, we just need to wait for the recovery to take hold,' \" said Michael Strain, a resident scholar in economics at the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute. \"We've been waiting for the recovery to take hold for a while. Both parties are responding to that.\" Jeb Bush earlier this year, in a speech about the middle class, acknowledged not only that Americans are frustrated, but that elbow grease can't fix everything. \"Far too many Americans live on the edge of economic ruin,\" the former Florida governor said, \"and many more feel like they're stuck in place: working longer, and harder, even as they're losing ground.\" He later added, \"Something is holding them back \u2014 not a lack of ambition, not a lack of hope, not because they're lazy or see themselves as victims. Something else. Something is an artificial weight on their shoulders.\" That's the idea at the center of the election, and everyone in the race seems to have latched on. Now, politicians are peering at it through their respective philosophical lenses to decide how to fix it. \"Republican rhetoric is much more growth-centric: 'The solution to this is economic growth,' \" said Steven Schier, professor of political science at Carleton College. \"That's a very common Republican theme, whereas Democrats are more regulatory and redistributive. In other words, they're reverting to type.\" Bernie Sanders has advocated higher taxes on the rich, decrying what he calls \"casino capitalism\" in a May interview. \"The people on top have lost any sense of responsibility for the rest of the society,\" said Sanders, an independent from Vermont, who has gained traction as the principal alternative to Clinton in the Democratic primary. Marco Rubio, the Republican senator from Florida, has a tax plan that will, among other things, dole out a heftier child tax credit to some families. Clinton believes that targeting \"quarterly capitalism\" and focusing on the American worker, via paid leave and helping keep mothers in the workforce, could be answers. Bush comes at it from the other, macroeconomic direction, saying if Americans can work more hours and if government stays out of the way of the \"gig economy,\" he can bring about 4 percent growth. That speeding train (or, perhaps, Uber car) of growth will bring everyone along with it, he contends. It's not just about presenting policies, of course. Presidential campaigns are about choices. And in the fight to make the choice clearer for frustrated Americans, the most pointed blows yet have been between Clinton and Bush. \"Now comes Hillary Clinton, and her economic agenda could be summarized easily: Whatever Obama is doing, let's double down on it,\" he said in a speech earlier this month. The implicit message: If you hate the economy now, Clinton won't change it. For her part, Clinton and her affiliated groups have latched onto several Bush statements that could make him sound unsympathetic to workers \u2014 in particular, earlier this month, when he said that people would have to work longer hours in his economy. (His campaign later clarified that he was talking about part-time workers who want more hours.) \"Well, he must not have met very many American workers,\" Clinton said in response. \"Let him tell that to the nurse who stands on her feet all day or the teacher who is in that classroom, or the trucker who drives all night. Let him tell that to the fast-food workers marching in the streets for better pay. They don't need a lecture. They need a raise.\" While they're appealing to an exhausting stretch of stagnant wages for American workers, they're really tapping into a decades-old idea of how the economy should work. \"We're still trying to figure out how wealth gets distributed in an economy where you've seen manufacturing and union jobs and what used to be the typical middle-class blue-collar jobs evaporate,\" said Leonard Steinhorn, a professor of public communication and history at American University. He continued, \"The bottom line is that [politicians are] dealing with a set of expectations Americans have about the economy, and a sense of acknowledging that frustration that a great many people don't feel that they're participating in the mythical rising tide that existed briefly after World War II.\" (See chart.) Despite newfangled campaign trail rhetoric about things like the emerging sharing economy and, yes, Uber, very old roles are at work here: Democrats championing the downtrodden laborer; Republicans bemoaning regulation. Still, what's new in the 2016 election is really that Americans' anxiety about the economy is getting more entrenched by the day.",

            "article_content": "Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton rolls out her economic policy agenda and says she is focused on growing the wages of the middle class.  ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: Voters may be taking time off this summer, but candidates for the 2016 presidential election are hard at work. We'll hear how some of these campaigns are doing in Iowa and New Hampshire in a moment. But first, an economic address from Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton. In New York today, she outlined the domestic policy agenda that she hopes will define her campaign. NPR's Tamara Keith reports. TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: You can easily hear the influence of the leading progressive economist Clinton consulted as she developed her speech and policy plans. She talked about growing income inequality and stagnating middle-class wages, but she said these long-term trends shouldn't determine the nation's destiny. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) HILLARY CLINTON: Today, I'm proposing an agenda to raise incomes for hard-working Americans, an agenda for strong growth, fair growth and long-term growth. KEITH: If there's one message her campaign wanted to send with this speech, it's that Clinton is focused on growing the wages of the middle class. She talked about Wall Street regulations, family friendly workplace policies and tax changes that would reduce advantages enjoyed by the wealthy and big corporations. She even argued for corporations to share profits with their employees - in short, a laundry list of policies Democrats already generally support. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CLINTON: The measure of our success must be how much incomes rise for hard-working families, not just for successful CEOs and money managers and not just some arbitrary growth target untethered to people's lives and livelihoods. (APPLAUSE) KEITH: That was a dig at Jeb Bush, who recently said if he were president, he'd get GDP to grow at 4 percent. For his part, Bush said Clinton was being defeatist and called her policy ideas antiquated. Tamara Keith, NPR News. Copyright \u00a9 2015 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Bernie Sanders' household took in more than $205,000 in 2014, and paid the feds nearly $28,000 in taxes.\n                \n                    \n                    Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Sen. Bernie Sanders' household took in more than $205,000 in 2014, and paid the feds nearly $28,000 in taxes. This story was first published by Vermont Public Radio. Sen. Bernie Sanders spends a lot of time on the presidential campaign trail talking about the plight of the middle class and the prodigality of the \"one percent.\" Meanwhile, Sanders and his wife, Jane, were likely in about the top 5 percent of American income earners last year, according to copies of their 2014 tax returns obtained by Vermont Public Radio. The Sanders household took in more than $205,000 in 2014, and paid the feds nearly $28,000 in taxes \u2014 an effective rate of about 20 percent based on Sanders' taxable income of $141,000. That means they likely earned more than 95 percent of Americans, according to the most recent data available from the U.S. Census Bureau. Sanders had an estimated net worth of $330,000 in 2013, according to financial disclosures filed with the U.S. Senate and analyzed by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, a watchdog group that tracks money in politics. But that's a relative pittance on Capitol Hill, where the median net worth for a member of Congress topped $1 million in 2013, according to the Center's analysis. In the Senate, Sanders is downright poor: the median there was about $2.8 million. \"Congress is a special, elite set,\" said the Viveca Novak, the Center's editorial and communications director. \"Most members of Congress are millionaires.\" And Sanders is pretty poor by senatorial standards, Novak said: Based on his 2013 financial disclosure forms, the independent ranked as the 86th richest member of his chamber. The Sanders' earnings also dims in comparison to the money raked in by his top rival for the Democratic presidential nomination, Hillary Clinton. The former secretary of state and her husband, former president Bill Clinton, made more than $25 million in speaking fees alone between the start of 2014 and mid-May of this year, according to financial disclosures. \"He's pretty close to the bottom\" among presidential candidates, Novak said. \"I don't know if there's any major candidate who has a smaller net worth. I mean, you look at [Republican] Jeb Bush, and Jeb Bush last year made about $8 million. So there's a pretty big disparity there.\" The biggest chunk of the Sanders' income last year came from the senator's $174,000-a-year congressional salary. (His occupation, as noted on his federal return: \"Government Service.\") Sanders' presidential campaign spokesman, Michael Briggs, explains the Sanders took in another $39,281 from Social Security benefits; $4,982 from the senator's Burlington mayoral pension; and $4,900 from Jane Sanders' governor-appointed spot on a low-level, radioactive waste commission. One unanswered question raised by the returns is the breakdown of the Sanders' $56,377 in itemized federal deductions. The Sanders donated $8,350 to undisclosed charities, Briggs said. But the campaign declined to release any more information about the deductions. Meanwhile, the Sanders household doled out $7,903 in Vermont state income taxes, and gave $150 to state programs benefiting children, the environment and veterans, according to their state tax return. And, yes, the self-described \"democratic socialist\" who supports publicly-funded presidential campaigns did put his money where his mouth is: Both the senator and his wife checked off those little boxes on their federal tax return, thereby sending $6 to the cause.",

Bernie Sanders discussed foreign policy, racial tension and his 2016 chances. Since entering the race for president, Vermont independent Sen. Bernie Sanders has been on the rise against Hillary Clinton, staking out a position as a liberal alternative to the Democratic front-runner. Sanders discussed the one issue in which he might be more conservative than Clinton \u2014 gun control. Below are highlights of other issues he discussed with NPR's David Greene on Morning Edition. (A transcript of the full interview follows below.) On 'Black Lives Matter' vs. 'All Lives Matter' Hillary Clinton got some blowback for not saying, \"Black lives matter,\" while speaking in a town next to Ferguson. Instead, she said, \"All lives matter.\" Sanders said he would say, \"black lives matter,\" but so do those of other races and ethnicities. And then he pivoted to economic welfare, as he typically does. \"Phraseology, of course I'd use that phrase,\" Sanders said. \"Black lives matter; white lives matter; Hispanic lives matter. But these are also not only police matters, they're not only gun control matters, they are significantly economic matters. ... Because it's too easy for quote-unquote liberals to be saying, 'Well, let's use this phrase.' Well, what are we going to do about 51 percent of young African-Americans unemployed? \"We need a massive jobs program to put black kids to work and white kids to work and Hispanic kids to work. So my point is, is that it's sometimes easy to say \u2014 worry about what phrase you're going to use. It's a lot harder to stand up to the billionaire class and say, 'You know what? You're going to have to pay some taxes. You can't get away with putting your money in tax havens, because we need that money to create millions of jobs for black kids, for white kids, for Hispanic kids.'\" On foreign policy Sanders called for a multilateralist foreign policy to \"come up with an intelligent, rational approach\" to dealing with world threats. He also intimated he'd be in favor of a reduction in military spending and noted he voted against and \"helped lead the opposition\" to the war in Iraq and even voted against the first Gulf War in the 1990s. \"Bernie Sanders would have learned the lessons of Iraq and Afghanistan,\" Sanders said, adding, \"As the former chairman of the Veterans Affairs Committee, Bernie understands what the cost of war really is.\" He pointed specifically to brain injury and post-traumatic stress disorder. \"Bernie Sanders gets very, very nervous when he hears Republicans who apparently just can't get enough of war \u2014 whether it's going to war in Syria, going to war in Iraq, going to war in Iran, going to war with Russia,\" Sanders said. \"So obviously these are very difficult issues, if I had a magic solution you'd be the first to hear it. I don't have a magic solution.\" On military spending, he added, \"I have concerns that we are already spending more money on the military than the next nine countries that our Department of Defense can't even sustain and independently audit. We're wasting a huge amounts of money on defense.\" On whether if he loses, he could hurt the eventual Democratic nominee Sanders challenged comparisons made about him to past presidential candidates, who harmed front-runners in one way or another. \"So the implication is I guess somebody should decide who the candidate is and we should all go to sleep,\" Sanders said. \"Well, that's a good idea; that's what really democracy is about, right? That's an absurd point. The point is that we need serious debate about serious issues in this country. ... I personally respect Hillary Clinton, and I like her. But if anyone thinks that having debates on issues is a bad thing for America, uh, frankly I don't know what world they're living in. ... \"My goal right now is to win this election. We have hundreds of thousands of people who have made campaign contributions. We have even more who want to participate in this campaign. My goal is to win this campaign by running on the issues that the American people feel strongly about and what they feel strongly about is that, 'enough is enough, the middle class cannot continue to disappear while the rich and large corporations end up with almost all of the income and all of the wealth.'\" Renee Montagne: It's Morning Edition from NPR News. Good morning, I'm Renee Montagne. David Greene: And I'm David Greene. He was born in Brooklyn. Built a life in Vermont. Now, Bernie Sanders is running for the Democratic presidential nomination. He says if voters are truly sick of the status quo \u2014 look at him as an alternative. Bernie Sanders: The reality of Washington, D.C., today is that we have one party, the Republican Party, completely dominated by big money and right wing folks. And you have another party, the Democratic Party, too much controlled by corporate money. What I have said over and over again, is that no president, no matter how extraordinary can deal with the problems facing the middle class, the disappearing middle class, the growth and grotesque level of income and wealth inequality, the high unemployment rate. We have no president can deal with that. Unless we mobilize the American people and create a strong grass-roots movement that says enough is enough, the billionaire class cannot have it all.\" DG: Saying Bernie Sanders entered the presidential race as a long shot is an understatement. But he's got some momentum these days. He's inched up in the polls. And he's drawing some big crowds. We sat down with the 73-year-old Vermont senator away from the campaign trail, in his office on Capitol Hill. And we began talking about last week's massacre at a black church in South Carolina. Those killings have many Democrats pushing for gun control again. Bernie Sanders' record has been mixed. There are plenty of gun owners in Vermont. BS: I come from a state which is, very rural state. We have tens of thousands of people who are hunters, who enjoy the outdoors. We have virtually no gun control. But I think the people of Vermont and I have understood for many years that what guns are about in Vermont is not what guns are about in Chicago or Los Angeles or New York, where they're used not for hunting or target practice but to kill people. DG: And Sanders ticked off what he calls \"common sense\" restrictions that he has supported. Keeping guns away from the mentally ill. Instant background checks. Closing the background check loophole at gun shows. Banning assault weapons. But at times though, he's also stood up for the rights of gun owners in his state. So we asked him what voters around the country should expect if he's elected president. BS: My state has virtually no gun control but again strong opposition, I have voted for gun control so that should tell people around this country that I am prepared to deal with this issue. Second of all I think the people of Vermont and rural America are supportive of sensible gun control legislation. So the issue is, you know, what people say is, I come from a rural state which has no gun control, he's weak on gun issues. You know what my lifetime voting record with the NRA is?\" DG: It has gone from F to D ... and .... BS: Yeah so this is not exactly make me into a quote of quote gun nut. When you get a D or an F from the NRA. But let me just say this ... DG: But more supportive of guns than other, than some of the Democrats ... BS: Well, I can understand that if some Democrats or Republicans represent an urban area where people don't hunt, don't do target practice, they're not into guns. But in my state, people go hunting and do target practice. Talking about cultural divides in this country, it is important for people in urban America to understand that families go out together and kids go out with their parents and they hunt. And enjoy the outdoors. And that is a lifestyle that should not be condemned. DG: Let me ask you about a related subject, Ferguson, Missouri, a community that obviously \u2014 the protests there after the death of a young black man brought a national conversation about race to the forefront. Hillary Clinton visited there and some people complained about her word choice. She said \"All Lives Matter\" rather than using a phrase that's become very important to many people, \"Black Lives Matter.\" What phrase would you use? BS: Well the first point I would make about Ferguson is in fact the good news right now, is on an issue that has been taking place for decades, and that is police officers killing or beating up people who are under their custody. We are now beginning to pay attention. DG: Mhm. BS: So the good news is we are talking about this and we need to address this issue. But what I would also say, when we talk about issues \u2014 whether it's guns, whether it's police brutality, we should also understand something else about Ferguson. You know what the unemployment rate for young African-Americans in Ferguson is, which virtually no one has talked about? DG: Remind us. BS: 50 percent. And in fact a new study came out that for young African-Americans between the age of 17 and 20 the unemployment rate is 51 percent. DG: But if I may return to my question, we had the voice of a woman on our air who protested in Ferguson. She said she needs to hear her president say the lives of my children matter, my little black children matter. I mean, are you ready to go to Ferguson and say black lives matter? BS: Am I ready to go to Ferguson? What do you think I've been saying on the floor? When the lives matter, it means we are not going to accept police brutality or illegal behavior against young African-Americans OR anybody else. But when you talk about \"lives matter,\" sometimes what we forget is when 51 percent of young African-American kids are unemployed. Are those lives that matter? DG: \"But what do you make of Hillary Clinton being dinged by some people for not using that phrase ...\" BS: <inaudible> I want to get back to you. No, no, no one second, alright. 51 percent of young African-American kids are unemployed, that's in a generation. One out of three or one out of four young black males born today are likely to end up in jail. Do you think that's an issue we should be talking about? DG: It sounds like you would have been ready to say that phrase if you were there? BS: Phraseology, of course I'd use that phrase. Black lives matter, white lives matter, Hispanic lives matter. But these are also not only police matters, they're not only gun control matters, they are significantly economic matters. DG: So ... BS: Wait a minute let me just answer this ... DG: Sure. BS: Because it's too easy for quote-unquote liberals to be saying 'well let's use this phrase.' Well, what are we going to do about 51 percent of young African-Americans unemployed? We need a massive jobs program to put black kids to work and white kids to work and Hispanic kids to work. So my point is, is that it's sometimes easy to say \u2014 worry about what phrase you're going to use. It's a lot harder to stand up to the billionaire class and say, you know what? You're going to have to pay some taxes. You can't get away with putting your money in tax havens, because we need that money to create millions of jobs for black kids, for white kids, for Hispanic kids. DG: If you're the commander and chief it's obvious you'd have to make a lot of decisions dealing with foreign policy and I wonder if we could talk briefly about one. Russia has emerged as a threat, again. You have NATO countries like the Baltics asking for help, the U.S. and NATO are moving heavy weapons right to the Russian border. Vladimir Putin reacted in a very frightening way. Some are suggesting that the U.S. and NATO are fanning the flames here. What would President Bernie Sanders do? Well, Bernie Sanders would have learned the lessons of Iraq and Afghanistan. Bernie Sanders voted against the first Gulf War. Bernie Sanders voted against the war in Iraq and helped lead the opposition to that war. And as the former chairman of the Veterans Affairs Committee, Bernie understands what the cost of war really is. And not only 6,700 brave men and women killed but hundreds of thousands coming back with PTSD and TBI. And Bernie Sanders gets very, very nervous when he hears Republicans who apparently just can't get enough of war. Whether it's going to war in Syria, going to war in Iraq, going to war in Iran, going war with Russia. So obviously these are very difficult issues, if I had a magic solution you'd be the first to hear it. I don't have a magic solution. DG: So do you put weaponry ... BS: But what it means is that the entire world community has got to come together. It's not just the United States, I do not want the United States to be fighting wars in four separate parts of the world. The United States has got to work with our European allies and allies throughout the world to come up with an intelligent, rational approach to deal with Russia, to deal with ISIS and deal with other national security threats. DG: Sounds like you would intervene less than this president has? BS: No, I didn't say that. You've got to look at each particular case, obviously. But uh, I am concerned about Russia, we're very concerned about ISIS, but once again, the United States cannot be the only country in the world intervening in so many countries. I think we've got to learn that lesson. DG: I, I want to look at history just for a second. Um ...There have been underdog candidates in past presidential elections, who have ended up hurting their parties. 1968, Eugene McCarthy forces a fellow Democrat out of the race, Lyndon Johnson, a Republican \u2014 Richard Nixon \u2014 becomes president. 1992, Pat Buchanan really bruises President George H.W. Bush, and you end up with a Democratic president \u2014 Bill Clinton. Is it fair when people compare your candidacy to candidacies like that? BS: I'm not quite sure that I ... Is the point being? DG: When people... BS: Excuse me... DG: Sure, sure. BS: Is your point being that people should not contest elections, that we should simply have the establishment bringing forth a candidate and anyone who rose ... is that your point? DG: It's not my point ... BS: It's an absurd point. DG: It's not my point ... People have made comparisons to your candidacy ... BS: People have made a whole lot of points. So the implication is I guess somebody should decide who the candidate is and we should all go to sleep. Well that's a good idea, that's what really democracy is about, right? That's an absurd point. The point is that we need serious debate about serious issues in this country. I've been in Congress for 16 years, in the senate for nine years, a mayor for eight years. I've got a pretty good record. And what I'm trying to do is speak for the needs of working families in this country and have a intelligent debate on serious issues. I've never run a negative political ad in my life, I personally respect Hillary Clinton and I like her. But if anyone thinks that having debates on issues is a bad thing for America, uh, frankly I don't know what world they're living in. DG: If you don't end up with a nomination but you feel like there was that kind of serious conversation would you point to it as a success? BS: My goal right now is to win this election. We have hundreds of thousands of people who have made campaign contributions. We have even more who want to participate in this campaign. My goal is to win this campaign by running on the issues that the American people feel strongly about and what they feel strongly about is that enough is enough, the middle class cannot continue to disappear while the rich and large corporations end up with almost all of the income and all of the wealth. DG: Senator Sanders, thank you very much for the time. We appreciate it. BS: Thank you. DG: That's Vermont senator and Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders.

Lincoln Chafee announced he will seek the Democratic nomination to be U.S. president during an address to the George Mason University School of Policy, Government, and International Affairs at their campus in Arlington, Va., Wednesday. Lincoln Chafee has been a Republican U.S. senator and an independent governor and now is taking a shot at the presidency, as a Democrat. Chafee announced his bid in a speech in Arlington, Va., at George Mason University on Wednesday. In his speech, Chafee said, \"I enjoy challenges, and certainly we have many facing America. Today I'm formally entering the race for the Democratic nomination for president.\" During his speech, Chafee highlighted his strong opposition to military intervention in the Middle East, saying, \"we have to find a way to wage peace.\" He said drone strikes weren't working in the region. And he also said, \"We must deliberately and carefully extricate ourselves from expensive wars,\" Chafee said. \"Just think of how better this money could be spent.\" Chafee stressed using that money for investment within America's borders. \"Education infrastructure, healthcare, environmental stewardship and a strong middle class are Americans' priorities.\" Chafee's political evolution has been gradual. He is the son of the late Rhode Island Senator John Chafee, a moderate Republican, and was appointed in 1999 to succeed his father. He won the seat on his own the next year. He was ranked the most liberal Republican in the Senate. He was the only GOP senator to vote against authorizing the use of force in Iraq, and supported abortion rights. He also said he did not vote to re-elect President George W. Bush in 2004, instead casting a write-in vote for Bush's father. His deviation from party orthodoxy brought him a primary challenge in 2006, which Chafee survived, but he then lost to Democrat Sheldon Whitehouse in the general election. Chafee announced he was leaving the GOP the next year. In 2010, he ran for governor of Rhode Island as an independent, and won election in a four-way contest. In 2012 he became a Democrat, and then decided not to seek re-election as governor. He recently told Time magazine that he intends to make Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton's vote to support the Iraq war a focal point in his presidential campaign: \" 'We're still paying for it,' he said, saying the war will end up costing the country $6 trillion. 'We're paying for it financially in taking care of our brave veterans ... but we're also paying for it overseas ... The repair work goes on. It's relevant to today.' \" Chafee's background is as unusual as his many political incarnations. Before entering politics, Chafee worked as a farrier at harness race tracks.",

Martin O'Malley, a Democrat who is considering a 2016 presidential campaign, is interviewed by NPR's Steve Inskeep.\n                \n                    \n                    Ariel Zambelich/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, a Democrat who is considering a 2016 presidential campaign, is interviewed by NPR's Steve Inskeep. Hillary Clinton is inauthentic, not transparent and will have trouble connecting with younger voters. And Republican economic theory is \"bull- - - -.\" That was essentially the argument Martin O'Malley made in an interview with NPR for why voters should choose him to be president over Clinton \u2014 the overwhelming favorite for the 2016 Democratic nomination \u2014 as well as whichever candidate survives the Republican primaries. \"The bigger issue is, do we have the ability as a party to lead by our principles?\" O'Malley told NPR's Steve Inskeep. \"Or are we going to conduct polls every time we try to determine where the middle is on any given day?\" The full interview is to be broadcast Monday on NPR's Morning Edition. O'Malley argued that as governor of Maryland he, unlike Clinton \u2014 who officially declared she is running for president April 12 \u2014 has led the charge on some issues dear to progressives. \"I'm glad she's come around to those positions on the issue of marriage equality, which we passed in Maryland,\" O'Malley said. \"I'm glad she's come around to the issue of drivers licenses for new American immigrants so that they can obey the rules of the road. This was something we did also in Maryland. So I'm glad she's come around to those positions.\" Clinton, like many other Democrats and the country at large, has evolved in her position on whether gay and lesbian couples can marry. On driver's licenses, during her last run for president, she declined in a 2007 debate to back a proposal by then-New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer to grant licenses for immigrants in the country illegally. Recently she reversed her position and said she was in favor of them. Clinton found herself embroiled in controversy earlier this year because of her exclusive use of a private email account to conduct official business as secretary of state. She kept a private server in her home and turned over to the State Department what she and her lawyers had determined to be 30,000 work-related emails. The rest of the emails, which she deemed to be private, were deleted. The scandal is something O'Malley, who said he will decide whether he runs for president by the end of next month, alluded to in why he could better appeal to a younger generation. Though he rarely criticized Clinton directly, his remarks seemed tailored to her. \"I see \u2014 having spoken to younger people, people under 40 \u2014 where our country's headed, and it is not the sort of siloed and bureaucratic and ideological world of many of us baby boomers and our siblings,\" he said. \"It is a more connected world, and it is a more collaborative and open and transparent world. That's the way I've always governed and that's the way that you have to govern in order to get things done today. \"I believe that differences will become apparent, and over the next month, I am sure she will start to roll out her policy choice.\" At 52, O'Malley is 15 years younger than Clinton. She would be the second-oldest president sworn in for a first term, trailing only Ronald Reagan. Still, O'Malley said Clinton would be better than any of the likely Republicans running for president. He dismissed Sen. Marco Rubio's assertion that a reason to reduce regulations is because the rich benefit more than the less well off as they are better able to navigate the system. O'Malley also panned collective GOP economic theory as something akin to fertilizer. \"Our tax code's been turned into Swiss cheese,\" O'Malley said when asked about GOP arguments regarding how to fix things like income inequality. \"And, certainly, the concentrated wealth and accumulated power and the systematic deregulation of Wall Street has led to this situation where the economy isn't working for us. All of that is true. But it is not true that regulation holds poor people down or regulation keeps middle class from advancing. That's kind of patently bull- - - -.\" NPR's full interview with former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley will be broadcast Monday on NPR's Morning Edition.",

While many Iranians would like to reorder relations with the West, there's also plenty of skepticism about whether it will actually happen. At the anniversary of Iran's revolution, Iranians still chanted \"Death to America.\" Yet many we encountered in a brief visit to the country seemed prepared to shift relations with the West. We interviewed more than 20 people in three cities: Tehran, Isfahan and Kashan. Our talks were very far from a scientific sample. They took place in a country where citizens must speak with great care. But the people we met in offices, in restaurants and on the streets represented a range of backgrounds and political views. They included liberals and conservatives, men and women, the young and old, the middle class and elites, people close to power and far from it. An economist seemed almost desperate for Iran to seize the opportunities that would come with a nuclear deal that lifts economic sanctions. An investor spoke of real estate developments for which he had already laid the groundwork; he was waiting for a nuclear deal before proceeding. A graphic designer said the burst of optimism that came after Iran's 2013 presidential election had subsided; she was ready for greater change. A craftsman hammering designs on metal vases agreed that little has improved since 2013, yet he remained quietly supportive of President Hassan Rouhani, who won that election. Rouhani has made better relations with the outside world his signature cause. To be sure, we encountered other views. It is significant that those linked with Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, were the most skeptical of a nuclear deal. Khamenei's authority exceeds that of the president, and shortly before we arrived, the supreme leader gave a speech in which he signaled openness to a deal. But he also laid out a number of explicit conditions for how the deal must be made. Iranians paid attention to this speech, and when asked about the nuclear deal, some said only that they relied on Khamenei's guidance. So a nuclear agreement seemed very far from assured. But Hamid-Reza Taraghi, a leader of a political party linked with Khamenei, insisted that Iran had \"100 percent\" of the political will that was necessary. A Tale Of Two Iranians The range of views can be represented by the stories of two Iranains: one who's eager for a nuclear deal, and one who isn't. They work within sight of each other. Mohammad Reza Shoghi, who handles public relations for the Basij, a revolutionary militia, poses in the former U.S. Embassy in Tehran, which is now a museum that's extremely critical of America. He doesn't believe Iran and the U.S. can have friendly relations.\n                \n                    \n                    Steve Inskeep/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Mohammad Reza Shoghi, who handles public relations for the Basij, a revolutionary militia, poses in the former U.S. Embassy in Tehran, which is now a museum that's extremely critical of America. He doesn't believe Iran and the U.S. can have friendly relations. The skeptical one is Mohammad Reza Shoghi. We met him at an evocative place: the former United States Embassy, where Iranian activists seized American hostages in 1979. Today the embassy is a base for the Basij, a revolutionary militia and political organization that is under the ultimate authority of the supreme leader. Basijis, as the members are called, are spread throughout the government and business world. And they include Shoghi, who works as a public relations specialist for the Basij. He showed us around the main building of the embassy, which has been made into a museum. The displays inside were entirely devoted to proving the evil of the United States. Wall posters showed dead bodies from the wars in Vietnam and Iraq. Nearby were documents and equipment captured in the takeover of the embassy in 1979, including machines labeled \"National Security Agency.\" The history Shoghi spun out in room after room is the history many Iranians have been taught, a mixture of fact and delusion. In this version the U.S. not only supported the shah of Iran, the ruler who was overthrown in 1979, but also staged the Sept. 11 attacks on itself. A huge mural running up the walls of the central stairwell showed planes striking the twin towers; American tanks invading Iraq; Jews controlling Hollywood; and the 12th imam, a key figure in Shiite Muslim theology, returning to earth in a manner similar to that which many Christians expect of Jesus Christ. At the end of the tour, Shoghi asked if we had any questions. Rather than dwell further on the past, I asked about the present. The supreme leader has signaled openness to a deal with America. What did Shoghi think? Shoghi said he doubted President Obama's sincerity, and noted that past efforts to resolve the nuclear impasse were spurned. \"How should we be optimistic, given the history?\" he asked. Shoghi was speaking through an interpreter, but his answer to another question required no translation. \"Do you believe that the United States and Iran can ever be friends?\" I asked. \"Nah,\" he replied. Shoghi has two sons. When I asked what future he wants for them, he said he just wants Iran to be independent of Western countries. 'I Have Been Crying Within Myself' Next to the former embassy we heard a very different view. Just across a side street, and visible over the embassy wall, is the Iran chamber of commerce. An annex next to it the holds the International Chamber of Commerce, where we found Mehdi Behkish. He's 70 years old, with a mild expression and a white goatee. Behkish is an economist who directs Iran's chapter of the international chamber. And he is an eloquent spokesman for investing in his country. Mehdi Behkish heads Iran's International Chamber of Commerce in Tehran. He attended Indiana University in the 1970s and is a strong supporter of normalizing relations with the U.S.\n                \n                    \n                    Molly Messick/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption \"This is a land of opportunity,\" he said. \"For more than 20 years or so, or 30 years, our machines have not been renewed. Our lands have not been used. Our opportunities have not been grabbed ... and because of the depreciation of our local currency, I think labor and raw material are very cheap in this country.\" Of course foreign companies generally can't invest unless a nuclear deal relieves the economic sanctions. But Behkish can envision such a deal. His idea of the United States is more rounded than the one on display at the embassy, because he's lived in the U.S. He attended Indiana University in the 1970s and graduated shortly before Iran's revolution. The education made all the difference to Behkish, who was raised far from Iran's capital in the city of Mashhad. \"I grew up in a very poor family,\" he said, \"and a very populated family. We were nine children and I was the eldest.\" Several of his brothers became leftist political activists, but once Behkish reached Indiana, he \"learned the modern situation of the capitalist world, the free market world.\" He insists that world is not so foreign to Iran's rich tradition as a trading nation, astride the ancient Silk Road that ran from China to Europe. In the decades since the 1979 revolution, Behkish has watched the market economy slowed by war, turmoil, the Islamist government and Western economic sanctions. \"I have been crying within myself sometimes, to see such huge opportunities, the benefits of which should go to the people,\" he said. What if there is no final deal? \"Personally I would say that it can't be that there would be no deal because otherwise the situation cannot be understandable,\" he said. \"I think that's so bad, so bad that I would reject it. Even I would not give a 1 percent choice for that. The other alternative would be war, so there should be a deal, sooner or later. I hope so.\" Behkish thinks Iranians are optimistic that there will be a final deal \u2014 so much so that the optimism has helped Iran pull out of its devastating recession. And for Behkish it is not too early to dream. He told us that Iran could be a major manufacturing center, a transit way to Central Asia, and a far greater producer of petrochemicals. And he is already looking forward to the moment when it could all begin \u2014 which would also be the moment that he could return to the United States for the first time since the '70s. \"When this [nuclear] deal is done, I will be in Washington in four or five months,\" he said. \"We've got to set up a U.S.-Iran chamber of commerce.\"",

            "article_content": "As the economy improves, political debates change. President Obama says it's time to focus on stagnant middle-class incomes. Republicans are trying to come up with their agenda for the middle class.  RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: As the economy improves, the political debate is changing. President Obama says it's time to focus on middle-class incomes that aren't improving. That sounds like comfortable political turf for Democrats, but Republicans are joining the debate, trying to come up with their own agenda for the middle class. NPR's Mara Liasson reports. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Not so long ago, leading Republicans called any discussion of income inequality class warfare. Mitt Romney famously said the income gap was so divisive, it should be discussed only in, quote, \"quiet rooms.\" But Republican rhetoric is changing at a head-spinning pace. Today, when Republicans talk about wage stagnation or the growing gap between rich and poor, they sound like - well, Democrats. Let's start with Romney himself. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MITT ROMNEY: Under President Obama, the rich have gotten richer, income inequality has gotten worse. And there are more people in poverty in America than ever before. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) SENATOR TED CRUZ: It is true that the top 1 percent are doing great under Barack Obama. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JEB BUSH: The recovery has been everywhere but in the family paychecks. LIASSON: You also heard Ted Cruz and Jeb Bush. Those complaints are more than just the latest anti-Obama talking points. It's the beginning of a real shift in Republican thinking, says conservative Ramesh Ponnuru. RAMESH PONNURU: It means that Republicans are waking up to the diminishing returns that they're getting from following their old playbook on economic matters - cutting taxes on investments, increasing economic growth and that'll work for everybody. That message is less and less in step with the middle class. LIASSON: Political necessity is forcing Republicans to play on what's traditionally been Democratic turf. On Election Day in 2012, a whopping 80 percent of voters told pollsters that Romney could not relate to the problems of people like them. PONNURU: That is symptomatic of a middle-class problem that Republicans have had. LIASSON: Republicans are acknowledging that the next election will be about why it's become so hard to move up the economic ladder. It's no accident that Republican presidential hopeful Marco Rubio's new book is called \"American Dreams: Restoring Economic Opportunity For Everyone.\" Jeb Bush's new PAC is called the Right to Rise. Last week in Detroit, Bush gave his first big policy speech and said that the opportunity gap was the defining issue of our time. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BUSH: Today, Americans across the country are frustrated. They see only a small portion of the population riding the economy's up escalator. LIASSON: Bush didn't offer many specific solutions to this problem. He said he'll be doing that over the next several months. So far Republicans seem to have learned the music, but they still need the lyrics. A group of conservative thinkers known as Reformacons have floated a bunch of ideas, including expanding the child tax credit and streamlining the system of education tax credits. But crafting a Republican agenda for the middle class may involve moving away from Republican orthodoxy on taxes and social programs. Former Bush speechwriter and Reformacon ally Michael Gerson says that won't be easy. MICHAEL GERSON: Because the default value of a lot of Republican rhetoric is really the Reagan rhetoric of the 1980s that has to do with tax rates and regulatory environment. And Republicans will always think those things are important, but they're going to have to fill out something that's broader than the Reagan message of the 1980s. LIASSON: Of course, Republicans will also have to compete with the Democrats' middle-class economic agenda. And it's a big one - free community college, paid family leave, higher minimum wage, universal preschool, expanded tax credits - former Clinton policy aide Bill Galston wonders if Republicans can develop enough credibility in this area. BILL GALSTON: It takes a long time for political parties to develop reputations and almost as long to shed their reputations. The Republican Party has been seen for a long time as a party that inclines towards wealthy Americans. So Republicans will have to be leaning against that perception pretty hard to move it. LIASSON: Something new on the Republican side is needed, says Gerson - a deep rethink, like what Bill Clinton did for the Democrats in 1992 after they had lost the White House just about as many times as Republicans have now. GERSON: Republicans don't have to outbid Democrats, but they have to show that they're sincere about offering a compelling, hopeful alternative in an economy that has become complex, difficult and frustrating for many people who are working hard and not getting ahead. LIASSON: It's not clear yet exactly what the Republican candidates will offer. But they seem determined to compete with Democrats to convince voters they do have the answers to the biggest problem facing the American economy - that hard work is no longer a guarantee of making it into the middle class or staying there.

            "article_content": "Free from the constraints of a re-election campaign and out from under the weight of the recession and massive federal deficits, President Obama unveiled his proposed budget for 2016 on Monday.  DAVID GREENE, HOST: There are different ways to look at a White House budget like the one that came out yesterday. You might see it as a set of specific proposals - ideas - and how much they would cost, and that wouldn't be wrong, though even President Obama's budget director on this program yesterday said it is more of a vision. In many ways, it's the president's latest entry into a debate over the size and role of government, as NPR's Mara Liasson reports. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: For the last several years, Congress and the White House have been consumed by an effort to cut the budget deficit and at the same time climb out of the deep hole of the Great Recession. The message of the president's fiscal year 2016 budget is been there, done that. Free from the constraints of a re-election campaign and out from under the weight of the recession and massive federal deficits, Mr. Obama is trying to refocus the debate in Washington on a different problem. It's a big, persistent and, even for economists, mysterious one - even when the economy is expanding, economic growth is unevenly shared, almost all the gains go to the top sliver of Americans with the most income and wealth. Middle-class incomes have stagnated, and even when productivity improves, wage growth doesn't follow. The president says his budget will begin to correct that. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Will we accept an economy where only a few of us do spectacularly well, or are we going to build an economy where everyone who works hard has a chance to get ahead? That was the focus of my State of the Union address a couple of weeks ago, what I called middle-class economics, the idea that this country does best when everybody gets a fair shot, and everybody's doing their fair share, and everybody plays by the same set of rules. The budget that Congress now has in its hands is built on those values. LIASSON: The president's budget increases spending by 7 percent over last year. He wants to invest in infrastructure and research and offer tax credits to lower- and middle-income families paying for education, child care or retirement. His budget asks the richest Americans and the biggest banks to pay for those initiatives. For the first time in a long time, both sides actually agree on the problem - inequality is growing and the middle class is stuck. The president has put his first offer on the table. Next up, the Republicans, who have already rejected his plans to raise taxes, will have a chance to offer theirs. Mara Liasson, NPR News, Washington. Copyright \u00a9 2015 NPR.  All rights reserved.

He'd been investigating the country's worst terror attack, a bombing at a Jewish community center that remains unsolved 20 years later, and he accused Argentina's president of a cover-up. He was found dead earlier this month with a bullet to the head. The way Argentines view Nisman's murky death could greatly affect the country's politics. NPR's Lourdes Garcia-Navarro was at the funeral in Buenos Aires. LOURDES GARCIA-NAVARRO, BYLINE: Flanked by policemen on motorbikes, the car carrying prosecutor Alberto Nisman's body is now driving into the Israelite Cemetery of Buenos Aires in front of me, where he will be laid to rest in a private ceremony for family and friends. But Nisman's death has caused a very public political crisis in Argentina. UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTERS: (Chanting in foreign language). GARCIA-NAVARRO: Protesters chanted for justice as the procession went by. Opposition lawmaker Patricia Bullrich was in attendance. PATRICIA BULLRICH: (Foreign language spoken). GARCIA-NAVARRO: \"This is a sad day, a day when all Argentines have to reflect because what has happened is very serious and very grave,\" she said. \"There are many questions surrounding Nisman's death - was it murder? If so, who did it and why?\" Unfortunately right now in Argentina, depending on your political viewpoint the answers you come up with are very different, says Martin Bohmer, a professor of law in Buenos Aires. MARTIN BOHMER: We Argentines are in a very difficult moment that the Nisman case shows, which is, nobody actually believes anything. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Argentina is politically polarized. There's been 12 years of the leftist Kirchners in office. Nestor came to power in 2003 and he was succeeded by his wife Cristina Fernandez, the sitting president who's in her second term. Elections for a new leader take place in October. By law, President Kirchner cannot run again. BOHMER: Everybody wants to take advantage of this moment, that's the point. Everybody's using this death as a political pawn, you know? GARCIA-NAVARRO: The government says forces allied to the opposition killed Nisman. The opposition says it was the government, who either don't have control of their own intelligence services, or worse, did the deed themselves. JORGE CASTRO: (Foreign language spoken). GARCIA-NAVARRO: \"What the polls show,\" says Jorge Castro, a political analyst, \"is that up until now, the two sides - Kirchnerism on the one side and the opposition on the other - are heavily consolidated. The Kirchner block has somewhere between 33 to 37 percent of the vote.\" He says, \"for the leftists to win outright, they will need votes from groups outside their power base in the lower classes. That means courting the middle class. Those are the ones,\" says Castro, \"who are more engaged with the Nisman saga.\" In August, primaries will choose who are the main presidential contenders for each party. The governor of the province of Buenos Aires, Daniel Scioli, seems to the one whom Cristina Kirchner wants to succeed her. CASTRO: (Foreign language spoken). GARCIA-NAVARRO: \"So during this crisis, Scioli is adopting a non-confrontational attitude, non-polarizing,\" says Castro, \"so he can distance himself from the position of Cristina Kirchner.\" Nisman's death plays into the wider context of that coming power grab. The president wants to ensure her political legacy. The opposition wants to change the direction of the country, shift away from the alliance with countries like Venezuela, and get Argentina back in the good graces of the international markets. Martin Bohmer says the tragedy of Argentina's current political climate is that whatever becomes of the investigation into Nisman's death, people have already made up their minds here. BOHMER: The drama is not that we don't know, it's that we'll never know. Because even if we knew, people wouldn't trust it. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Lourdes Garcia-Navarro, NPR News, Buenos Aires.

Updated at 9:44 a.m. ET The Wall Street Journal describes President Obama's State of the Union speech Tuesday night as a \"victory lap on the economy\" while The New York Times said \"it would have been easy to forget\" that the address came just two months after his fellow Democrats were crushed in the midterms. Obama, while making the case for what he called middle class economics, declared that the state of the nation was strong. One indicator of the president's mood: When he noted near the end of the speech that he had \"no more campaigns to run,\" some Republicans applauded. His retort: I know, because I won both of them\" The Times adds: \"Never mind that his party actually lost the most recent elections, delivering control of both houses of Congress to the opposition for the first time during his presidency. For an hour on Tuesday night, Mr. Obama commanded the biggest stage he will have all year, unbowed and self-assured, laying out an expansive and expensive legislative agenda as if he were the one who had triumphed. \"Watching an emboldened Mr. Obama, it would have been easy to forget that he was standing there just two months after the biggest electoral repudiation of his presidency. Indeed, with economic indicators on the rise and his own poll numbers rebounding slightly, he made no reference at all to the midterm elections, offered no concessions about his own leadership and proposed no compromises to accommodate the political reality.\" The Journal noted that while Republicans have opposed Obama's past calls to raise taxes on the wealthiest Americans, \"the two parties' shared interest in speaking more directly to economic anxiety and wage stagnation has the potential to push them to find common ground.\" The newspaper's website also has a graphic outlining Obama's past proposals and how much progress he made on those stated goals. NPR's Scott Horsley reported on the speech for our Newscast unit this morning. He said: \"President Obama celebrated just how far the country has come since the deep recession that began seven years ago. With the economy growing, the deficit shrinking and domestic energy production surging, Obama says the United States has a choice to make of where it goes from here.\" The president called for higher investment taxes on the richest Americans, and for the proceeds to benefit working families. Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, offered the GOP response to Obama's speech. As NPR's Christopher Dean Hopkins noted, Ernst, who in 2014 became the first woman elected to the Senate from Iowa, echoed many of the themes in Obama's speech, but also reinforced her party's opposition to Iran and the Affordable Care Act. Obama visits Boise, Idaho, today to begin building support for many of the proposals he made in Tuesday's speech.

As The Washington Post notes, Obama's \"tone and tenor\" since the GOP trounced Democrats in the midterm elections in November \"have been anything but conciliatory.\" The New York Times reports that the president will likely use the speech \"to effectively declare victory over the economic hard times that dominated his first six years in office and advocate using the nation's healthier finances to tackle long-deferred issues like education and income inequality.\" The speech starts at 9 p.m. ET and will be covered live by NPR as well as by the major TV broadcast networks.

When Republicans took over both chambers of Congress in January, party leaders vowed they would prove to the country that Republicans could govern. They promised to stop with the self-made crises, such as government shutdowns, and rack up legislative accomplishments. So in the first year of a GOP-controlled Congress in nearly a decade, how well did Republicans prove they can govern? First, there were no government shutdowns or defaults on the national debt. Immediately after the midterm election in 2014, both Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker John Boehner promised there wouldn't be any shutdowns or defaults on their watch. Turns out they made good on that promise this year. But Democrats aren't exactly congratulating them for it. \"That's like saying, 'You know, they didn't blow the top off the Capitol, so clearly Republican leadership is in touch with America.' No, it takes more than that,\" said Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois. Nonetheless, it is fair to say that the widely held assumption Congress gets nothing done doesn't exactly fit this year. There was an uptick in bipartisan activity in this Republican-controlled Congress in 2015, but if you ask Democrats why that was, they'll say it's because they were a more cooperative minority than Republicans were when Democrats controlled the Senate \u2014 and that they cooperated on legislation that bolstered Democratic goals. Whether or not keeping the government open counts as an accomplishment, here are eight legislative matters Congress did address in 2015 \u2014 and some issues that remain unresolved: Trillion-Dollar Government Funding Bill: Right before they split for the holidays, lawmakers passed a trillion-dollar spending bill that will keep the government open until the end of next September. The measure also beefed up cybersecurity and renewed a health care program for Sept. 11 first responders. It also made changes to the visa waiver program so people who have traveled to Iraq, Iran, Syria and Sudan in the past five years will face greater scrutiny if they wish to enter the U.S. Tax Extenders: Paired with the government spending bill was a measure containing hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks. Year after year, Congress has had to extend dozens of tax breaks that expire. In this measure, lawmakers made permanent the most popular tax breaks, such as the $1,000 child tax credit, the earned income tax credit for low- and moderate-income workers, and the research and development tax credit. Two-Year Budget Agreement: Right before Boehner left office, he managed to reach a two-year budget deal with the White House and other congressional leaders. The agreement suspends the debt ceiling through March 2017 and increases spending by $80 billion over the next two years \u2014 an increase that's split evenly between defense and domestic programs. No Child Left Behind Rewrite: Congress easily passed legislation to rewrite the 2002 No Child Left Behind Act. Federally mandated math and reading tests will continue, but the new law cedes greater authority to states, rather than the federal government, to figure out how to use the test results in evaluating schools. Five-Year Transportation Bill: Congress passed its first long-term bill in a decade to fund roads, bridges and mass transit systems. The measure does not raise the gas tax, currently at 18.4 cents per gallon, but found other sources of funding \u2014 such as changing customs fees and dipping into funds from the Federal Reserve. Ended The NSA's Bulk Surveillance Program: Lawmakers passed the USA Freedom Act, which ended the government's bulk collection of phone records. Passage of the measure came after Republican senator and presidential candidate Rand Paul of Kentucky forced a two-day shutdown of the bulk collection program. Trade Promotion Authority: Congress approved a measure to give the president expedited authority to enter a trade deal with 11 other Pacific Rim countries. Attention now turns to the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement, which Congress is expected to consider next year \u2014 possibly after the election is over. Medicare Reform: Known as the \"Doc Fix\" bill, this measure permanently ended automatic Medicare payment cuts to physicians. Under a law from the late 1990s, Medicare payments to doctors would be cut to keep the program's budget in check. Since then, Congress had failed every year to figure out a long-term solution to the problem. Still, so many issues remain unresolved \u2014 not because lawmakers think they're unimportant but because partisan divisions on these ideological issues are so deep, they can't find common ground. Congress seems happy to take these issues to the voters in 2016. Guns: After a spate of gun-related tragedies in 2015, Democrats vowed to push for gun control legislation, such as measures to expand background checks and prohibit individuals whose names are on terrorist watch lists from purchasing firearms. Both measures failed in the Senate in 2015, as in past years. Immigration: The Senate managed to pass a comprehensive immigration overhaul package in 2013, but attempts to move the legislation through the House failed. Efforts to resurrect immigration legislation have since languished. Tax Reform: After the midterm election, corporate tax reform was seen as a possible area Republicans and Democrats could work together on. But at his year-end news conference, McConnell expressed pessimism about getting any tax reform accomplished with a Democrat in the White House, saying that any tax changes need to be revenue-neutral and he doubted the president would go for that.",

At the time, many Protestants questioned whether Kennedy's Catholic faith would allow him to make important national decisions as president \u2014 independent of the church.\n                \n                    \n                    AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption In 1960, then-presidential candidate John F. Kennedy spoke to a group of Protestant ministers about the issue of his religion. At the time, many Protestants questioned whether Kennedy's Catholic faith would allow him to make important national decisions as president \u2014 independent of the church. Here is the challenge for presidential candidate Bernie Sanders: He has long described himself as a Democratic socialist. A Gallup Poll earlier this year found only 47 percent of Americans said they would vote for a socialist for president. More people said they would support an atheist, a Muslim or a Mormon. Asked during last month's Democratic debate how a socialist, of any kind, could be elected president, the Vermont senator said, \"We're going to win because first we're going to explain what Democratic socialism is.\" And so, Sanders is set to give a big speech Thursday explaining just what he means by Democratic socialism. Think socialism and you may think of the government taking over the steel mills and the oil refineries \u2014 the means of production. That's not what Sanders has in mind. But he does envision a greatly expanded role for government. Sanders is calling for things like Medicare for all and free public college paid for by higher taxes on the wealthy. He'd do some redistribution of wealth. But he's thinking modern day Denmark \u2014 not 1950s USSR. Still, when you say socialism, many people think of Marx and Lenin. \"Bernie Sanders is taking on an uphill fight, but he's trying to change the definition of a basic word,\" says Kathleen Hall Jamieson, director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania. \"Every program that conservatives haven't liked for the past 40 years has been identified as a socialistic program and no one has been standing up to defend socialism,\" adds Jamieson. \"In effect the word has taken on very negative connotations because no one has taken the time to define it differently.\" But the very viability of Bernie Sanders' candidacy depends on whether he can take the word back, give it new meaning. And his Democratic socialism speech is part of that. There's a history of big political speeches designed to take on and neutralize a lingering concern of voters. Here are four speeches Sanders might use as a model for his address: John F. Kennedy on his Catholic faith: In 1960, John F. Kennedy, who was Catholic, faced questions about whether he would take orders from the Vatican if he were elected president. He tackled the issue head on in a speech to a group of protestant ministers called the Greater Houston Ministerial Association. \"I am not the Catholic candidate for president,\" Kennedy said in a key line of the speech. \"I am the Democratic Party's candidate for president, who happens also to be a Catholic. I do not speak for my church on public matters, and the church does not speak for me.\" Mitt Romney's \"Faith In America\" speech: As he ran for president the first time, Mitt Romney felt compelled to explain his Mormon faith. Romney was a leader in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and spoke about his faith and religious freedom in a speech at the George Bush Presidential Library. \"I will put no doctrine of any church above the plain duties of the office and the sovereign authority of the law,\" Romney said in the address. President Obama's speech on race Then-candidate Barack Obama gave a speech about race relations in America in March of 2008 at the Constitution Center in Philadelphia. Obama, who would become the nation's first black president, was compelled to address matters of race after video surfaced of his pastor, Jeremiah Wright, disparaging white America. \"The fact is that the comments that have been made and the issues that have surfaced over the last few weeks reflect the complexities of race in this country that we've never really worked through, a part of our union that we have not yet made perfect,\" Obama said. Barack Obama gave a speech addressing race relations in America in 2008.\n                \n                    \n                    Alex Brandon/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Barack Obama gave a speech addressing race relations in America in 2008. These speeches follow a pattern. This is me. This is why you shouldn't be concerned. And this is why you should feel good about electing me. But the analogy for Sanders is imperfect, says Jamieson. She suggests a better one might be a speech from 1964 by Ronald Reagan. Reagan's \"A Time For Choosing\" Reagan wasn't running for president. He was an actor and pitch man who had been enlisted by the campaign of Barry Goldwater to make a case for the republican nominee. And Reagan used the speech to reclaim conservatism. \"Somewhere a perversion has taken place,\" Reagan said in the televised speech before a live audience. \"Our natural unalienable rights are now considered to be a dispensation of government and freedom has never been so fragile, so close to slipping from our grasp as it is at this moment.\" In 1964, Ronald Reagan gave a speech titled \"A Time For Choosing,\" in defense of conservatism. Watching this speech is to see the early threads of today's conservative movement. In many ways, the Reagan speech is a mirror image of what Sanders aims to do with his speech. It's not about identity. It's about ideology and a view about the size and role of government in American life. Reagan thought it should be smaller. Sanders thinks the role of government should be much larger. And like so many elections before it, that is likely to be one of the defining debates of this contest.",

At a community center in Orlando this week, Puerto Rican leaders from all over the U.S. gathered at a conference with an ambitious goal: to forge a national political agenda \u2014 and flex some political muscle. Betsy Franceschini, a representative of the island's government, puts their message to Congress and the White House plainly: \"If you want our vote, you must listen to us.\" After Mexicans, Puerto Ricans are the second-largest Hispanic group in the United States. A million Puerto Ricans live in Florida alone, for instance, about the same number as New York. Large numbers have also settled in Pennsylvania, Texas, New Jersey and other states. But unlike other Hispanics, as U.S. citizens, Puerto Ricans who move to the mainland arrive here qualified to vote. And Puerto Rico definitely could use some help. The island's government has been struggling to make payments on more than $72 billion in debt. Puerto Rico's economy has been in a recession for most of the past decade; unemployment is more than twice the national average. Jose Lopez of Chicago's Puerto Rican Cultural Center says people are moving to the mainland at a rate not seen since an era from 1946 to 1966, when 2 million people left the island. \"We're actually experiencing even that at a higher scale today,\" Lopez says. \"So without a doubt, I believe that for Puerto Ricans, this hits at the core of their very inner soul.\" Lopez helped organize the conference and planned it in Florida, in large part because of the importance of the Puerto Rican vote there. There are nearly as many Puerto Ricans in Florida now as Cuban-Americans. In the last election, aided by a strong Puerto Rican turnout, President Obama won the Hispanic vote and carried the state. Rep. Luis Gutierrez of Illinois, a Democrat, has been working with other members to gain support in Congress for measures to help the island, such as allowing the government there to restructure some of its debt through court-supervised bankruptcy. Puerto Rico is also facing a healthcare crisis and a shortfall in federal reimbursements for Medicare and Medicaid. Addressing the conference, Gutierrez called on President Obama to make good on a promise he says the president made when the Affordable Care Act was passed, a promise to provide more funds for Puerto Rican healthcare when it was needed. \"Mr. President. it is time to provide the additional funds to the people of Puerto Rico,\" Gutierrez said to the conference. Puerto Rico is facing big cuts in federal Medicare payments, while the states are seeing increases. Gutierrez says that makes no sense. \"You cannot continue to cut health care in Puerto Rico because what you are saying to them is, 'Jump on the next airplane and come to Florida, or come to Chicago, or come to New York where you will be treated with equality.' \" Gutierrez and others who represent the interests of Puerto Ricans in Congress are also pressuring the Treasury Department to help the island renegotiate its crushing $72 billion debt. That effort may be bearing fruit. There were reports this week that the Treasury Department is considering setting up and overseeing a debt exchange program for Puerto Rico.",
