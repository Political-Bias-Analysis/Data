The flashlight, \"lady farmer\" and lotus blossom (Prime Minister Modi's party symbol) appear on voting machine ballots for elections this spring. No party claimed the violin, the computer mouse and the nail clippers. When India's 900 million eligible voters go to the polling booths for this spring's general election, they might cast their vote for a kite. Or a comb. Or a mango. These are three of the hundreds of symbols that appear on electronic voting machines in India, each representing one of the nearly 2,300 political parties vying for more than 500 seats in the lower house of parliament in seven stages of voting through late May. You might also encounter a ceiling fan. Or a coconut. Or an umbrella. Even Prime Minister Narendra Modi has a symbol \u2014 he's a lotus flower. That's the symbol of his political party, chosen because it's India's national flower and also because it's the flower upon which the Hindu goddesses of wealth and knowledge sit. Most of the symbols look like emojis on your smartphone or illustrations from a children's dictionary or encyclopedia. Any everyday object that most Indians would be familiar with can be an electoral symbol. A kettle? A kitchen sink? A sofa? They're all qualified to represent political parties. To make sure voters get the message, parties' symbols are printed on political banners, splashed across the stage at political rallies and emblazoned on the covers of election manifestos, documents released by parties to make their case to voters. The icons have been part of India's electoral process since its first democratic election. It was 1951, and India had recently gained independence from British colonial rule. But how could a country hold an election when about 80 percent of its population were illiterate and so couldn't read the names on the ballot paper? Symbols helped. \"Symbols made it easier for people to associate [themselves] with political parties. They are like the logos of companies,\" says Kavita Karan, a professor at Southern Illinois University. In the decades since India held its first general election, its literacy rate has shot up. According to the 2011 census, which is the most recent, 74 percent of Indians are literate compared to 18 percent in, say, the 1950s. Does that make symbols obsolete? Political analyst Biswanath Chakraborty doesn't think so. Literacy in India may be high, but functional literacy \u2014 which means the ability to read and comprehend \u2014 is still not more than 50 percent, he says. According to a 2011 study, only a quarter of those counted by the census as \"literate\" could read a second grade text. Also, Indians are used to voting for symbols rather than names. \"Even after 100 percent literacy in India, I think it won't be easy for us to prepare the ballot only based on the name of the candidate,\" says Chakraborty. Symbols also help reduce the confusion during polling when lots of candidates are in the race, he says. Parties can select from a list of symbols published by the election commission, an independent body which oversees the elections. Many of the symbols were drawn by hand by the late draftsman M.S. Sethi, who retired from the commission in 1992. A cauliflower, a soap dish, a stapler are all part of the stockpile. According to an election commission circular from March, there are nearly 200 symbols currently unclaimed by any party. Parties can also propose a symbol if they're not satisfied with any of the options in the commission's reserve. But there are some rules. The symbols are supposed to be neutral so as not to influence voters. For example, a symbol with a religious connotation or one that represents a particular community would not be permitted. (There have been some petitions to India's courts demanding that Modi's party give up its lotus blossom.) Historical monuments like the Taj Mahal are a no-no for similar reasons \u2014 people might pick them out of national pride. In 1991, the election commission ruled out using any type of fauna as a symbol after some animal rights activists raised concerns. They feared people would attack or torture a creature if it embodied a politician or party they didn't support. The electoral symbols don't just represent a party. They also tell the story of India's socioeconomic transformation, says Chakraborty. Some of the earliest symbols depicted objects from a mostly rural India: a plow, a cow, a bullock cart. Then in the 1960s and 1970s, symbols like a tractor, a truck and an electric pole made their way into the commission's list. New to the 2019 catalog are a laptop, a computer mouse and a USB stick. \"This tells us how India has gone from being a rural country to an urbanized, modern India,\" says Chakraborty. A symbol has an emotional appeal. People should be able to relate to it, says Karan. Often, a symbol represents a party's ideology or what change it hopes to bring in society, she adds. The open-palmed hand of the Indian National Congress, India's main opposition party, represents hard work. With a broom as its symbol, the Aam Aadmi Party, a regional party in northern India, hopes to \"clean the filth that has permeated India's government and legislature,\" it said in a 2013 statement. But some of the new symbols added by the election commission may seem rather unconventional. Perhaps that's why no one has claimed the nail clippers. \"Given the number of parties and independent candidates, it appears that the election commission is running out of relatable symbols, so they are giving away these odd and funny symbols,\" says Karan. This year's contest is largely between the lotus and the open-palmed hand. But who knows, maybe in the future India will witness an election where a pair of nail clippers is pitted against a tube of toothpaste. Sushmita Pathak is NPR's producer in Mumbai.",

That's because, since the first U.S. census in 1790, the federal government has included incarcerated people in the population counts of where they're imprisoned.

Since the first U.S. census in 1790, the federal government has included incarcerated people in the population counts of where they're imprisoned. In many cases, rural, predominantly white towns see their population numbers boosted by population counts from prisons disproportionately made up of black and Latinx people. In turn, states, which control how voting districts are drawn, and local governments can use those numbers to form districts filled predominantly with people who are locked behind bars and cannot vote in almost all states. Maine and Vermont are the exceptions. Officials in some prison towns have come up with creative ways to avoid forming voting districts made up primarily of prisoners. But in many others, political lines are drawn around prisons in a way that critics deride as \"prison gerrymandering.\" Loading... Split along partisan lines A recent study about Pennsylvania's state legislative districts by Villanova University associate professors highlights the impact this process can have on the political voice of incarcerated people's home communities. It found a \"substantial likelihood\" that Philadelphia would gain an additional majority-minority district for Pennsylvania's state house if prisoners incarcerated in the state were counted as residents of their last known addresses. \"The incarcerated are not only missing from their communities,\" the study's authors, Brianna Remster and Rory Kramer, wrote, but \"they are also advantaging other communities.\" Still, the issue of where to count prisoners for census numbers has been split largely along partisan lines. Most supporters who want to change the way incarcerated are counted are Democrats, while Republicans generally want to keep things the way they are. In 2015, when the Census Bureau was collecting public comments about its rules for counting people in prisons, Thomas Hofeller \u2014 a prominent Republican redistricting strategist who died in 2018 \u2014 warned against adjusting prisoners' numbers. Hofeller expressed concern that \"the actual effect on reapportionment and redistricting is not clearly known for individual states,\" according to a document Hofeller's daughter, Stephanie, provided to NPR that was copied from his hard drives. \"This change is being encouraged by Democratic or Liberal organizations and could involve the Census Bureau in yet another political conflict,\" Hofeller wrote in the Microsoft Word document, first reported by The New Yorker.

Many rural, predominantly white prison towns see their population numbers boosted by prison populations disproportionately made up of black and Latinx people. What worked in 1790 \"just doesn't work anymore\" The following year, the bureau received another round of public comments on the issue. More than 99% of the close to 78,000 comments collected in 2016 \"suggested that prisoners should be counted at their home or pre-incarceration address,\" the bureau reported in a Federal Register notice. The Census Bureau has said, however, it has no plans to change its policy for the 2020 count. \"Counting prisoners anywhere other than the facility would be less consistent with the concept of usual residence, since the majority of people in prisons live and sleep most of the time at the prison,\" the bureau announced in 2018. But some critics say that policy has become out-of-date since it was first implemented for the 1790 census. \"What has changed is just the massive scale of incarceration in the U.S. What worked for the country in 1790 just doesn't work anymore in terms of data methodology,\" says Aleks Kajstura, legal director of the Prison Policy Initiative, a research and advocacy group campaigning to change how incarcerated people are counted. \"Even up until the 1970s, the incarcerated population was low enough that it did not impact redistricting when people were counted in the wrong place.\" Kajstura also points out that many prisoners are likely to be released or moved to another facility after they're counted for the census. \"This facility that they happen to be incarcerated on Census Day is in no way reflective of the reality of where they actually even live and sleep most of the time even by the Census Bureau's own guidelines,\" Kajstura says.

But in many others, political lines are drawn around prisons in a way that critics deride as \"prison gerrymandering.\" A piecemeal approach With the bureau refusing to change its policy, state lawmakers, civil rights groups and other advocates have turned to a piecemeal approach to change how prisoner counts are used to redraw state and local voting districts by advancing legislation and fighting in court. In May, Nevada and Washington joined California, Delaware, Maryland and New York in passing laws since 2010 requiring relocating prisoners' numbers from where they're incarcerated to their last known home addresses for redistricting. After the 2020 census, the bureau is planning to help those states recalculate their counts in time for redistricting by releasing data about incarcerated people earlier than it did after the 2010 count. In Connecticut, state officials are facing a lawsuit filed by the NAACP after they used 2010 census numbers counting prisoners where they're imprisoned to redraw voting maps. The country's oldest civil rights organization is arguing in court that the state's redistricting plan has inflated the voting strength of districts of predominantly white voters and violated the 14th Amendment's \"one person, one vote\" principle, which requires districts to have about the same number of people in them. \"There's no comment\" In Wisconsin \u2014 where around 1 in 8 black men age 64 and younger, is behind bars, the highest incarceration rate for black men in the country \u2014 Democratic state lawmakers introduced a bill in September that would relocate prisoner numbers for redistricting. If it becomes a law by the time Wisconsin's political maps have to be redrawn after the upcoming census, a major shift in local political representation may be coming to prison towns such as Waupun. Loading... In this rural, predominantly white town located northwest of Milwaukee, around 1 in 4 people is incarcerated. It is home to three state prisons, including the facility where every adult male prisoner sentenced to Wisconsin's prison system is processed, Dodge Correctional Institution. Together, the three facilities in Waupun house more than 3,000 incarcerated people convicted of a felony, who cannot vote while behind bars. These prisoners make up the majorities in two of the town's voting districts represented by alderpeople on the town's common council. According to Waupun's official website, alderpeople rely on \"input from residents\" to \"ensure a citizen-centered process\" when they're making decisions on behalf of the town. But the elected officials of Waupun's two majority-prisoner districts told NPR that they have never visited the prisons in the areas they represent. \"There's no reason to communicate on property I don't have access to,\" Alderperson Ryan Mielke, who was reelected this year with 43 votes to represent District 3 \u2014 where about 61% of his constituents are incarcerated and cannot vote, according to the Prison Policy Initiative's analysis. Asked whether he ever wanted to know how many people are in the prison he represents, Mielke replied: \"There's no comment.\" A spokesperson for Wisconsin Department of Corrections told NPR that elected officials are welcome to visit its facilities. \"We have state senators and representatives come through a number of our institutions pretty regularly,\" said spokesperson Clare Hendricks. \"We're welcome to it.\" Together, three state prisons in Waupun house more than 3,000 incarcerated people who were convicted of a felony and cannot vote while behind bars.

Compared with other constituents in his district, Kaczmarski says representing constituents who are behind bars is very different. \"You almost have to think for them because you don't, perhaps, have that day-to-day interaction,\" said Kaczmarski, who lives down the street from Waupun Correctional. Robert Alexander \u2014 who is serving time in Waupun, about an hour-and-a-half drive away from where he was living in Milwaukee \u2014 and the three other prisoners NPR interviewed at the facility said they were not previously aware that Kaczmarski was elected to represent them. \"There's no way that he can say what we feel unless he decides to come in and talk to us,\" he said. It doesn't sit well with Alexander that he can be counted for political representation in a place he doesn't consider his residence. \"It's almost like your body being used,\" Alexander said. An uneasy relationship has been playing out in Waupun as the town's officials try to keep its prisons in the background and attract more tourists and business developers with a rebranding effort featuring taglines such as \"Naturally Adventurous.\" The three prisons have been a main driver of Waupun's economy for decades. But Kathy Schlieve, Waupun's city administrator, said officials see a trade-off from having incarcerated people included in the town's population count. Wisconsin's state license plates are made by incarcerated people at Waupun Correctional Institution, where prisoners began manufacturing plates in the early 1900s.

So even how we think about recruiting retail, it becomes a much bigger challenge when the data's not depicting the reality of the community that's out spending the dollars.\" The town's officials commissioned a study published in 2009 in order to produce a profile showing what Waupun's demographics would look like if the prison population was removed. Still, Schlieve said that prisoners should be counted as residents of Waupun, in part because the town is providing prisoners with ambulances, as well as police and fire department services. \"What I would say is purely because we are providing those protective services and infrastructure pieces, I think it's appropriate as it is,\" Schlieve says. \"I think we will follow the letter of the law.\" Kajstura, the Prison Policy Initiative's legal director, says that a 1981 legal opinion by Wisconsin's then-state attorney general puts towns like Waupun in \"a bind\" in terms of how it has to redraw voting districts. For state and local redistricting, \"institutional populations cannot be excluded\" from the population count produced by the Census Bureau, according to the opinion. But Schlieve said in a written statement that Waupun is interpreting the bureau's \"usual residence\" rule to mean that the town has to \"count inmates in our community.\" In other prison towns around the U.S., however, local officials have devised ways to avoid creating voting districts made up primarily of prisoners. In Kentucky's Oldham County \u2014 where two of its districts contain prisons \u2014 incarcerated people were excluded from the 2010 census numbers used to redraw the voting map. Officials in Florence, Ariz., avoid the issue altogether by holding at-large elections that allow all voters to choose candidates from the same pool. Stuck in limbo Maryland and New York are the first states in the country to relocate their numbers of incarcerated people back to the last known addresses of the prisoners. After the 2010 census, those states underwent a complicated process to make sure prisoners were matched with the correct home addresses, according to a study by New York Law School. Four additional states \u2014 California, Delaware, Nevada and Washington \u2014 plan to implement similar changes after the 2020 count.

But for some prisoners, determining where \"home\" is can be complicated. After serving their time, many incarcerated people, uprooted for years, do not return to where they were living before they were locked up. \"Wherever they want to send you, they send you. Wherever they want you to be, you be. So it's not a home,\" says Alexander, who is not expected to be released from Waupun Correctional Institution until 2030. \"You're never in a position where you make this home because you're always planning to exit.\" NPR data editor Sean McMinn and former intern Koko Nakajima contributed to this report.",

The work paid off. Her score on the exam was good enough to get her into the top-rated University of Chile. Vega is now in her third year, studying to be a nurse. And thanks to an important change in government policy, life got easier after that: She didn't have to pay.

That's because Chile has made college tuition-free \u2014 through a policy called gratuidad \u2014 after years of angry public protests about escalating tuition and student loan debt and the gulf in quality between the institutions attended by the wealthiest and the poorest students. It's a version of \"free college\" along the lines of what many in the United States are talking about \u2014 including several Democratic candidates for president. Chile's educational system has significant parallels with that of the U.S.: a robust sector of private colleges alongside public universities; high college tuition; and, before gratuidad, significant student loan debt. That makes it a prime test case for the American version of the idea. Among other things, what has happened in Chile proves that free tuition is politically popular. In 2013, Michelle Bachelet, then the socialist candidate for president, made it a centerpiece of her campaign and won by a 2-to-1 margin; several years later, the Chilean Congress passed it by a vote of 92-2. Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era, the conservative who succeeded Bachelet, has continued the policy. And it's a popular idea in the U.S., too: Seventy-one percent of Americans support free tuition at public universities or colleges for students who are academically qualified, according to a survey by PSB Research for the Campaign for Free College Tuition.

In 2016, the Chilean Congress passed gratuidad \u2014 \"free college\" \u2014 by a vote of 92-2. How it came to be A driving force behind the move to gratuidad in Chile was deep socioeconomic divisions in society, a remnant of Chile's authoritarian government that ruled the country from 1973 to 1990. In 2011, the frustrations and anger boiled over into strikes and protests. Demonstrators marched against high college costs and large amounts of personal debt from student loans. The frustrations then were similar to those that have sparked political protests in recent weeks. \"In Chile, you can't move things\" without people in the streets explains Miguel Crispi, who is now a deputy, or member, of the Chilean Congress. Back in 2011, the debate was all about education. Chileans, over their breakfasts, \"were talking about inequality,\" says Crispi, who was a student leader during those protests. He recalls whole families \"talking about, 'How can we afford a higher education? Is it fair to go into debt for studying?' \" As in the U.S., the movement rose above financial concerns about paying for college to a broader, philosophical principle: Higher education is a right. \"The most important way of being free is having the tools for doing what you want to do in life. That's education,\" says Crispi. \"It's about being free or having the chance to be free.\" It's expensive When gratuidad finally began in Chile, lawmakers quickly realized that the ambitious program \u2014 free tuition for everyone \u2014 costs a lot, even in a country with just over 5% the population of the U.S. It became clear the program had to be scaled down and delayed, with complex restrictions added. The same thing has happened to free-college proposals in the U.S.: A campaign promise by New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy to make community college in that state tuition-free, for instance, had to be reduced to a pilot program. And the free-tuition plan in New York state set an income limit for recipients. In Chile, the biggest cost-saving measure was reducing the number of students who qualified. College would not be free for everyone but for the poorest Chileans \u2014 only those whose families were in the bottom half of the income range.

Gratuidad has since been expanded to include the bottom 60%. Even after those revisions, the price tag for Chilean taxpayers is $1.5 billion a year. (In the U.S., Sen. Bernie Sanders' plan to make two- and four-year college free for everyone \u2014 regardless of income \u2014 is projected to cost the government $47 billion per year.) Is it working? Despite the investment in Chile, the reform is making only slow progress toward its primary goal: expanding access to higher education for the lowest-income students. That's because nearly 90% of those low-income students already had financial aid before gratuidad. But looked at another way, the prospect of free tuition does inspire students to enroll in college who might not have considered it previously. A recent report found that 15% of Chilean students in the program would have otherwise not sought a college education. And Chileans who get free tuition are also slightly less likely to drop out than their classmates who don't, the government has found. \"For some families, the assurance that they are not going to be facing any payment at all makes a difference in their willingness to take the chance and have their kid apply,\" says Andr\u00e9s Bernasconi, a professor at the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile who studies gratuidad.

When Pedro C\u00f3rdova Guerra, 55, was growing up in the suburbs of Santiago, he didn't even let himself dream about college. His family was poor, and in his mind, college was only for the wealthy. \"Back in my time, there were no opportunities,\" he says. \"I used to be bitter that I didn't get a chance to go to school. It was very difficult.\" He says he lived through that big shift in thinking: \"There were new ideals around education. ...

Most free-tuition programs in the U.S. don't cover those expenses either. And because they don't, two of the most ambitious programs, in Tennessee and New York state, have failed to improve affordability for low-income students, according to a report by the Institute for Higher Education Policy. In fact, that report found, in Tennessee it was higher-income students who benefited, getting an average of nearly $1,500 each to help them pay for college educations their families could already afford. The length it covers Beyond the financial limitations, however, students in Chile have another big complaint about gratuidad: the time limit. The program requires students to complete their degrees, or courses of study, on time. For example, a traditional four-year degree must be completed in that time.

One expert likened it to a time bomb and, sure enough, this year 27,000 of the students who had been enjoying free tuition came to the end of their eligibility before they graduated, according to the University of Chile Student Federation Research Center. Pilar Vega Martinez, who is in her third year of studying to be a nurse, says that last year she got bronchitis and missed weeks of school. \"I was doing really well,\" she says, but now, it will take her longer to finish than gratuidad will pay for. \"I'm still thinking about how I'm going to pay for that last year,\" she says in Spanish during a study break in the university's library. \"I've had to work while studying to start saving money.\" Students in Chile take 10% to 30% longer than the prescribed time, on average, to finish their degrees, the government says. That mirrors what happens in the United States, where many students need, for example, five or six years or more to complete a bachelor's degree. \"In 2011 the principal problem was that gratuidad didn't exist,\" says Ximena Donoso Rochabrunt, who just finished law school and is studying for the equivalent of the bar exam. \"And people are still mad that its existence is only partial.\"\n                \n                    \n                    Elissa Nadworny/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption \"In 2011 the principal problem was that gratuidad didn't exist,\" says Ximena Donoso Rochabrunt, who just finished law school and is studying for the equivalent of the bar exam. \"And people are still mad that its existence is only partial.\" \"In 2011 the principal problem was that gratuidad didn't exist,\" says Ximena Donoso Rochabrunt, who just finished law school and is studying for the equivalent of the bar exam. \"And people are still mad that its existence is only partial.\" The impact on private universities Private colleges in Chile, which can participate in gratuidad if they choose, are facing a financial squeeze because the government limits the tuition they can charge. In the first year, only a few private institutions took part, since they have relatively high tuition and serve wealthier students whose families' incomes are too high to qualify anyway. For those institutions that do sign on, \"costs are going to go up and income is going to stay very still,\" says Claudio Ruff, rector of the private Universidad Bernardo O'Higgins and president of the national association of private universities. His office overlooks a grassy quad, with a portrait of O'Higgins, the 19th century Chilean independence leader, on the wall and opera music playing in the background. It's hard to compete with free, says Claudio Ruff, rector of the private Universidad Bernardo O'Higgins and president of the national association of private universities.\n                \n                    \n                    Elissa Nadworny/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption It's hard to compete with free, says Claudio Ruff, rector of the private Universidad Bernardo O'Higgins and president of the national association of private universities. Already, Ruff says, 15 private universities and colleges have closed or are in the process of closing because it's hard to compete with \"free.\" Schools like his that remain but have opted out of gratuidad are cutting money-losing programs, offering discounts and scholarships and adding research to attract more students, including international ones. The colleges have largely themselves to blame for this predicament, argues Luis Felipe Jim\u00e9nez Leighton, an economist and former adviser to the Education Ministry who helped negotiate gratuidad. Their high fees helped drive the protests that resulted in the free-tuition system. \"Fat cats,\" he called them. \"Now [they] have to get lean. And that's a consequence of gratuidad that we didn't intend, but it's a byproduct and to some extent it's a welcome byproduct.\" Andr\u00e9s Bello National University is a private university in Santigao that does not participate in the gratuidad program.\n                \n                    \n                    Elissa Nadworny/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Andr\u00e9s Bello National University is a private university in Santigao that does not participate in the gratuidad program. Some private institutions in Chile may have gotten fat, concedes Ruff. \"But not any more. Private universities spend more money [than public ones], but they spend it better.\" Besides, he adds, private universities can \"tighten their belts faster.\" Looking ahead As it stands now, gratuidad is set to expand if and when tax revenues allow. But the argument in Chile now is over whether it should. Three years in, has it been worth it? Many, like Rosa Dev\u00e9s, say yes. Dev\u00e9s is a vice president for academic affairs at the University of Chile. Rosa Dev\u00e9s, a vice president for academic affairs at the University of Chile, helped write the gratuidad law. \"I feel quite proud of them,\" she says. \"It may be just words but still they are the correct words.\"\n                \n                    \n                    Elissa Nadworny/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Rosa Dev\u00e9s, a vice president for academic affairs at the University of Chile, helped write the gratuidad law. \"I feel quite proud of them,\" she says. \"It may be just words but still they are the correct words.\" When some people ask \"why am I going to pay for a rich person to go to university?\" her answer is: \"You're not paying for the rich person. You're paying for the institution that will have all the representation of the society in it.\" But Chile simply may not be able to afford that, says Leighton, the economist. \"We're not in a state of abundance where we can finance everything,\" he says. \"You have to prioritize some things and in the process to leave somebody in and somebody out.\" Right now, 68% of Chileans say they are against extending free tuition to everyone, preferring that only people in the bottom 70% of income be covered, one poll found. Conservatives, who now hold a majority in government, would prefer to put more money into primary and secondary education, where inequalities grow. \"Free tuition is not the only solution for getting more vulnerable students into university or into higher education,\" notes Jaime Bellolio, a conservative deputy in Congress who serves on the education committee. Regardless of free tuition, he explains, students still need the academic preparation if they are to gain admission into top universities. \"If you want to have more vulnerable students in good universities and good professional institutes you have to level up the quality of education before they come.\" He acknowledges that this point is not as politically catchy as \"free tuition\": \"It's not as good for the elections, but it is better for the long run, and it's better public policy. Those first years are the ones that make all the difference.\" Valparaiso, the city in Chile that houses the National Congress of Chile, where gratuidad became law.\n                \n                    \n                    Elissa Nadworny/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Valparaiso, the city in Chile that houses the National Congress of Chile, where gratuidad became law. Still, Dev\u00e9s argues that Chile has made big steps forward since Chileans took to the streets eight years ago. \"The path is not perfect,\" she says, pulling out a copy of the actual statute. Dev\u00e9s helped write the law and has highlighted some of her favorite parts. She tears up as she reads the words aloud. Translated from Spanish: \"The law establishes that higher education is right, that should be within reach of all people, in accord with their abilities and merits.\" \"I feel quite proud,\" she says. \"It may be just words, but still, they are the correct words.\" The work isn't finished yet, she adds, but gratuidad is \"a very important starting point.\" This story about tuition-free colleges was produced in collaboration with The Hechinger Report, a nonprofit, independent news organization focused on inequality and innovation in education.",

Jackson still gets nervous after decades on stage because she knows how \"easy it is to act really badly, and how very, very hard it is to act well.\" Shakespeare's King Lear is one of the most challenging and prestigious roles in theater \u2014 and one that's traditionally played by a man. But now a new production of King Lear on Broadway stars Glenda Jackson in its title role. The British actor, who is 82, is fine with the gender bending casting. \"When we're born, we teach babies ... to be boys or girls,\" Jackson says. \"As we get older, those absolute barriers that define gender begin to crack.\" Over the course of her career, Jackson has won two Oscars, two Emmys and a Tony Award. But she still feels jitters about being onstage. \"It doesn't get any less,\" she says. \"In fact, I think the more you do, the worse it gets, because you realize how desperately easy it is to act really badly and how very, very hard it is to act well.\" From 1992 until 2015, Jackson took a break from acting to serve as a member of Parliament. She describes her time in public service as a \"great privilege.\" \"That kind of responsibility is something that really makes you realize who you are \u2014 and you're pretty damn small,\" she says. On the limited number of interesting roles available for women Doors have opened for women that were firmly locked many decades ago. Why don't contemporary dramatists find us interesting? Glenda Jackson What I really, really feel strongly about \u2014 and I wish I could come up with the reason for it \u2014 is why contemporary dramatists find women so boring! They are rarely \u2014 if ever \u2014 the driving dramatic engine of a play or a film and I don't know why that is. I mean, we are by no means equal as a gender, or certainly not worldwide, but there have been major improvements. Doors have opened for women that were firmly locked many decades ago. Why don't contemporary dramatists find us interesting? On whether there are any lines from King Lear she finds particularly powerful I try to avoid that. I try to observe the world through the character's eyes. But people who see the play do point out lines that are particularly meaningful to them. I always rather regret that they do that, because then it gets kind of stuck in my head and I have to find another way of finding it for the first time. On growing up in a world that was 'entirely in the hands of the women' I was 3 when [World War II] started and 9 when it finished, and it was a world which is entirely in the hands of the women, because the men had all gone away to fight. I didn't realize ... at the time ... how much women had actually done. And then, as in the first World War, when it was over, they were told to go away and do what women should normally do, which is just look after the kids and do the cooking. Fortunately they didn't [do that]. ... I come from a socioeconomic group which if you didn't work, you didn't eat. So one of the things that I most valued that was given to me by my family was a strong work ethic, and I really, really do value that. On serving in Parliament and meeting with her constituents All members of Parliament hold what we call \"advice surgeries,\" [one-on-one meetings] and you hold them in the constituency and any constituent can come in and they would. And in some instances, in the really serious ones, they sort of lay their life out on the table in front of you. You don't know them. They don't really know you, and not infrequently their lives are tragic or disastrous, through no fault of their own. And they come to their member of Parliament because that member of Parliament is their port of last resort. ... In my experience I didn't always get the result that my constituent wanted, but without exception \u2014 whether I did or whether I didn't \u2014 they always said, \"Thank you.\" And that is very, very humbling. On a speech she gave in Parliament in 2013 after Margaret Thatcher died, in which she equated Thatcherism with \"greed\" and \"selfishness\" I'd sat there in the chamber for several hours as one does for these kind of events before I was called by the speaker. And yes, I mean I sat there listening to her party rewriting history as far as I was concerned. The United Kingdom that they were describing under Thatcher was not the one I'd lived in. It wasn't the one my constituents lived in. And it certainly isn't the one that was there when she left! ... I would have been ashamed if I hadn't spoken having been given the opportunity by the speaker. ... When I went home, my son was standing on the front doorsteps, and he said, \"Your speech has gone viral.\" Now, I'm a Luddite when it comes to artificial intelligence, so I don't know what \"going viral\" means. He explained to me, and I think it was something like a million people tuned in. Lauren Krenzel and Seth Kelley produced and edited this interview for broadcast.

Climate change is often thought of as a partisan issue in the United States, but New York Times journalist Nathaniel Rich says that wasn't always the case. Rich says that from 1979 until 1989, climate change was viewed as a bipartisan problem \u2014 then the the oil industry \"descended and bared its fangs\" and everything changed. In his new book, Losing Earth, Rich writes that in the late 1980s, the American Petroleum Institute began paying scientists to write op-eds questioning climate science. He describes the effort as a campaign to \"sow propaganda [and] disinformation, to buy off politicians and scientists, and, ultimately, to convert an entire political party to denialism.\" Rich says the campaign paid off. No longer was climate science accepted as fact: \"All of a sudden,\" he says, \"you have a number of pieces that start to appear that say maybe there's not scientific consensus about this problem.\" As a result, the Republican party began to shift its stance on climate change: \"It's become a starkly partisan issue,\" Rich says. \"And it seems like we are much further from a solution than we were 30 years ago.\" On oil industry research into climate science The industry has been following this issue for a long time. There are studies from Exxon or even Humble Oil, the predecessor to Exxon, going back into the mid-1950s and even then, those studies were not about whether or not this was happening. The question was how much of the added CO2 in the atmosphere was because of Exxon \u2014 basically because of the fossil fuel industry. They continued to monitor this over the decades. On how the American Petroleum Institute helped create a 'debate' around climate change The head of the API program told me they gave $2,000 to a scientist whenever he wrote an op-ed for a national publication. That is almost an afterthought at the time. It's pretty low on the totem pole of what they're doing. They're also meeting with Congressmen and so on. But it pays enormous dividends, because all of a sudden national news publications start quoting these scientists \u2014 it's really a handful of people, four or five people \u2014 over and over again. And an issue that, at this point, has been a story about fear of what's going to happen, all of a sudden has two sides. On climate change becoming a partisan issue We've entered this weird funhouse realm where now if you jump ahead to the present day you have a political party ... that endorses a position that's essentially to the right even of what the industry now says in their public statements. Exxon publicly today doesn't deny climate change, but you have a party that does. I think it's something that future historians will spend a lot of time piecing out is: How this little lie grew into a big lie and overwhelmed our politics. A Recent History by Nathaniel Rich Hardcover, 208 pages | Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How? On a major turning point that occurred in 1989 when George H.W. Bush declined to sign a United Nations treaty addressing climate change From '79 to '89 there are a series of escalating efforts to first bring the issue to the attention of the powers that be \u2014 people at the highest levels of the federal government \u2014 and then to bring it into the public to generate public concern. And finally, in the middle of the decade, a solution materializes which is a global treaty to reduce emissions that would be binding, and it's modeled after the ozone treaty, that's then in process. By the end of the decade we've reached the point of high level diplomatic meetings to negotiate this binding global treaty. We get to the precipice of an agreement on the framework of this treaty, and at the very last second the U.S. pulls out. ... At least on paper that's the closest we've come. I think you could have a reasonable debate about whether or not if the U.S. did sign the treaty we would've lived up to the terms of it, whether other countries would have lived up to the terms of it even if it was binding. And that's a more complicated conversation to have. I think at the very least we'd be a lot further ahead than we are now. That seems indisputable. On what the Trump administration has done to undermine environmental protections [Trump's] trying to roll back just about every policy that President Obama introduced, trying to roll back clean air standards, emissions from coal factories, mileage standards, CAFE standards they're called. You name it \u2014 an all-out assault, and not just on climate, but on any kind of environmental protection, I should say. I guess the only silver lining is that [with] something like the Paris Accord, he can he can withdraw, but the formal withdrawal doesn't happen for a couple of years, and even then the treaty is voluntary to begin with, so it's more of a political statement than anything else. Rolling back emission standards is probably at the top of the list of the bad things that are going on. But I think more destructive is just this peddling of this fantasy, and it's connected to a lot of other stuff you see in the administration: a basic affront on objective reality. You see that extends beyond the climate conversation and into, the conversation we're having about news and reporting and historical fact and all the rest. Climate change victimizes the victimized. It oppresses the oppressed. ... It cuts along class lines, racial lines, generational lines and socioeconomic lines. So the worse off you are, the more marginalized you are, the worse you're going to suffer from what's coming. Nathaniel Rich On what's new about Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Ed Markey's Green New Deal proposal It's a statement of principles. Primarily it's not a law. It's not a bill. ... In some of the particulars, it's less ambitious than bills that were proposed and introduced into Congress at the end of the '80s by both Republicans and Democrats. I think what distinguishes it \u2014 and what makes it a truly transformational document \u2014 is that it identifies the climate crisis as connected to every form, essentially, of social injustice that we have. I think that's the only honest way of looking at it. Climate change victimizes the victimized. It oppresses the oppressed. ... It cuts along class lines, racial lines, generational lines and socioeconomic lines. So the worse off you are, the more marginalized you are, the worse you're going to suffer from what's coming. So [the Green New Deal is] extremely valuable in that it says that climate change is not just one item on this sort of menu of political items, but it's the one that encompasses them all. You can't have social justice if there's not climate justice. You can't have a civil society, a stable society, if you don't have a stable climate. I think that's a profound argument and an honest one. It puts it into moral terms in a way that is new in Washington, and I think that is enormously valuable. You can get into the debate about how best to achieve certain goals \u2014 and those are important policy debates to have \u2014 but it's reframed the issue dramatically and I think critically. On how to motivate Americans to care about climate change This has been a big debate, particularly within the activist community, for a while now. It's essentially a marketing question: How do we get people to care about this problem and prioritize it? Is fear the best approach? Is hope? Inspiring people? I think that the trend has been towards the latter more. ... We think of it almost in, like, Hollywood terms, like either we're going to win this thing, or we're going to suffer a crushing defeat. But, of course, there's a huge range of outcomes in between, and at this point where we're at \u2014 ranging from the not very good to the apocalyptic \u2014 but that doesn't mean that we shouldn't try to better our situation as much as possible.

Kamala Harris told NPR: \"I will keep you posted.\" As possible 2020 presidential candidates start announcing exploratory committees, there's talk that Sen. Kamala Harris may be on the verge of launching herself into the ring. On Tuesday, her memoir The Truths We Hold hits shelves. In it, the California Democrat ticks through her r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and credentials, while mixing in a look at her upbringing and family life. Harris spoke with NPR on a number of wide-ranging topics, from her mother to her views on the death penalty and the Kavanaugh hearings to whether Joe Biden would make a good president. But she didn't commit to a presidential run herself. Here are some highlights from the discussion. People like you write books like this mostly when they are getting ready to launch a campaign \u2014 it's a \"get to know me on a national level.\" I have not made up my mind. There are a collection of factors to consider ... they include my family, they include the need for real leadership in this country and whether I can provide that leadership. So there are a number of factors, but I will keep you posted. But I am not prepared to make any announcement at the moment. Much of the book is framed around your mother. How does introducing her to your readers help them understand you? My mother was a force of nature. She was somebody who really committed her life to the service of others. She is and was somebody who was incredibly smart but incredibly loving at the same time. These things coexisted with my mother. And there's so much that I learned from her that we would call values and principals, and reason for being. Many people will not know that your mom was an immigrant from India. Why did she come to the U.S.? My mother was 19 when she graduated college. She wanted to study science. She went to her father, my grandfather, and my grandmother and said, \"I want to go and study at one of the best schools for that.\" And my grandfather, who had an arranged marriage to my grandmother, and this was in the 1950s that my mother approached them, my mother said she wanted to go and study at UC Berkeley California and my grandfather said go. And so they put her on a plane, and this is when transcontinental travel was not very common, she had never been to the United States. But my grandfather was really quite progressive, and he said to his eldest child who was his daughter, my mother: \"You go and you study.\" Truth be told, I believe that the plan was that she would then get that degree and come back and have a good arranged marriage in India, but my mother being who she was, the daughter of a father who fought for India's independence, she was naturally attracted to the civil rights movement that was exploding all over the United States \u2014 but also in the Bay Area... She became very involved in the civil rights movement, and met my father. Instead of going back to India and having an arranged marriage, she had a marriage based on love. And that really was, in many ways, an ultimate act of courage and optimism and really set in place the foundation for how I think of the world. As you mentioned, they were both activists \u2014 met during the civil rights movement. In light of that, did you ever consider representing marginalized people as a defender? Why did you decide to be a prosecutor? An American Journey by Kamala Harris Hardcover, 319 pages | Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How? At a very young age, I knew I wanted to be a lawyer. And mostly because the heroes among many of the civil rights movements were the lawyers. These individuals who understood the skill of the profession of law to translate the passion from the streets to courtrooms of our country and do the work that we know must constantly be done of reminding people of that promise we articulated in 1776, that we're all equal and should be treated that way. My family and extended family thought, at best, it was a curious decision and with some of them I had to defend the decision like one would a thesis. Why did they not expect that from you? They said, \"Why would you go and be a part of an institution that is not always fair and does not always pursue justice?\" Some would call it the persecutors office, not the prosecutor's office. ... Law enforcement has such a profound and direct impact on the most vulnerable among us. And there is a duty and a responsibility to be a voice for the most voiceless and vulnerable and to do the work of justice. And that's the work I wanted to do. ... It is also understanding that the victims of crime come from the same communities as those who have been treated unfairly. The victims of crime deserve a voice. I, for a while, specialized in child sexual assault cases. I'm gonna tell you, prosecuting those cases were extraordinarily difficult and some of the most important work I did. You have been criticized by some on the left over the death penalty, for defending the death penalty. How to you explain your position? To be clear, I am personally opposed to the death penalty. I have always been \u2014 and I remain \u2014 opposed to the death penalty. I believe for a number of reasons that it is a flawed system both in terms of the way that it has been applied historically, which is disproportionately against people of color and poor people. But you still think there's a place for it. No. I don't. But as attorney general of the state of California, I had a constitutional responsibility to represent my clients. And one of my clients happened to be the California department of corrections and the district attorneys of California who did seek, in many jurisdictions, a death penalty sentence. Going back to the Brett Kavanaugh hearings, do you regret how that unfolded for her [Christine Blasey Ford]? What I regret about her experience is that she was treated as though she was on trial. She was not on trial. She had done nothing wrong. ... She decided that what she had known needed to be known by the decision-makers. So she reached out to her member of Congress, to make sure that those people who have the responsibility for vetting this guy knew this thing that she knew. And she wanted to remain anonymous because it was never about her. She initiated all that visited her in the ensuing months because she felt an obligation as a citizen to make sure that those who are in a position of power and responsibility had all the information. And what ended up happening was a circus. What ended up happening was she was vilified for doing what she believed was the right thing to do. And again, having personally prosecuted sexual assault cases, I was incredibly disappointed and frustrated by the lack of information that leaders have about the nature of these kinds of issues like sexual assault. And how they treated her, I thought was regrettable and really unfortunate. And I have nothing but praise for her and her courage, including what it did, which was require people to have a national conversation about an issue that is seldom discussed \u2014 and impacts a wide range of people in all genders, in every socioeconomic background, race, religion and ethnicity. Big picture question: Why do you think Donald Trump won? I'll give you a crude analysis. I mean, if we had hour upon hours, I could get into much more depth and specificity. But here's my take on it: Over the last 10 years in our country, at least, we've seen an incredible amount of change \u2014 the Great Recession, the term \"Great Depression\" was already taken. But in America, then and today, people are literally walking around with the proverbial tin cup. Economic upheaval like we have not seen in generations. People lost their homes, they lost their jobs, many of whom will never be able to buy a home or have a permanent job again. People are reading about the browning of America and the immigrants are coming. And we had Barack Obama as president and then we had a women running as president and we had a Jew running for president and gay people can marry and: \"Oh my God, Oh my God.\" And then you talk about the impact of technology and automation ... There's an incredible amount of change that has happened in a relatively short period of time, and it has understandably had a lot of people feeling displaced, wondering and asking a question about where do they fit in, their relevance, are they obsolete. I think it brings into question questions of identity. What does it mean to be an American? What does it mean to be a productive American? What does it mean to be a breadwinner or the leader of a household? And people are also resentful of this change and where will they fit into it and will this include them. And [Trump] read it accurately. And then he took it to the lowest common denominator. [He said] it is us versus them instead of what real leadership would be about \u2014 which is to read it and say, \"Hey everybody, We're all in this together. And my vision of the future includes you. You are in my vision of the future. We will get through this together.\" You mention in your book about your relationship with a former attorney general of Delaware, Beau Biden, who passed away a few years ago of cancer. You call him an incredible friend. Do you think his father, Joe Biden, would make a good president? I think there are many people who would make a good president. And I got to know Joe as a person through Beau. They had an incredibly special relationship. It was really very special. I'm very fond of Joe Biden, so you're not gonna hear me criticize Joe Biden. I think he's a great guy. I started with an assumption about why you wrote this book, but I'm going to end by just asking you, what did you want to communicate? The election of November 2016 \u2014 obviously it was a national election for president, but it was also the night I was elected to the United States Senate. And as I write in the book, even just that night, which was the impetus for writing this book, I was experiencing our election and watching on the monitors this thing happen to our country. And I write about how my godson came up to me crying, \"Auntie Kamala, this man can't win.\" And he was afraid. And people were afraid. And my speech, impromptu that night, was we must fight. And that there is so much worth fighting for. And I wrote the book to talk about that. Do you think your mom would want you to run for president? I think my mother would want me to do whatever she thought I wanted to do. My mother, I write about it in the book, when she was in the hospital \u2014 and it was when I was just starting my race for attorney general \u2014 she had, at that point, disassociated from many things. She was turning things off. She was otherwise a voracious reader and passionate. She'd scream at the TV when necessary, when some debate was happening. And she was laying with her face turning the other way so her back was where I was, because I was just spending time with her. And then she said, \"Kamala, How's the race coming along?\" And I said, \"Well Mommy, they say they're gonna kick my ass.\" And she turned around in the bed and looked at me with this big smile across her face \u2014 and that says it all.

            "article_content": "White evangelicals overwhelmingly support President Trump. But when a group of white and black evangelicals get in the same room, it gets complicated.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: Evangelical Protestants are the nation's largest religious group, and white evangelicals make up 1 out of every 5 voters. This is a group of voters that Trump has spent a lot of time courting. So we went to Fayetteville, N.C., to hear from those voters about how they believe Trump has delivered for them. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) DAVID CLARKE: He's building up the military. He's building up the nation. He's building up the churches. He's saying God bless you every now and then. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: Most evangelicals are white, but not all. And the voters who met with us at the Arran Lake Baptist Church were a racially mixed group, in agreement on issues like restricting abortion access and LGBTQ rights, divided over Trump's so-called character issues. DICK BUTTON: We were supposed to be dealing with, how does faith affect our politics? And we've turned it into - in this room, we've started to turn it into a lynch President Trump. CORNISH: Take that word lynch - perfect example. Seventy-two-year-old Dick Button is using Trump's language about the House impeachment inquiry, the kind of language that doesn't sit well with the black churchgoers in the room. MARCUS BELT: He makes it extraordinarily hard. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) BELT: It's kind of the elephant in the room pertaining to the president. CORNISH: Marcus Belt is the first to bring this up. He's 48 years old, African American and a recently retired Army special operations veteran. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) BELT: If you ask a segment of white evangelicals what they think about him and then you ask a segment of African American or minority evangelicals what they think about him, you might get vastly different opinions. That's become polarizing even within our congregations, to a certain degree. CORNISH: Belt actually likes that Trump signed a criminal justice bill shortening sentences for some drug offenders but looks to Trump's track record on race and sees no good. And he's not alone. The Pew Research Center has found that 87% of black Protestants they polled disapproved of the president's performance. But when I try to ask about how these uncomfortable conversations play out in their churches, 89-year-old David Clarke, who is white, says... CLARKE: If you cut me right down the middle and you cut him right down the middle and pull the skin back, we're the same. We're the same. CORNISH: But yeah - go ahead. BELT: No. It's been like a Rorschach test within our congregations, and it very starkly breaks down by ethnicity. And it's amazing because up until the current president, I wouldn't have thought that we would see things so differently because typically, we tend to be about the same socioeconomic status, and we tend to be more alike than dissimilar in all other domains other than, you know, how well we tan. But this particular administration has - but most importantly, it's pointed out that we have some significant work to do within our congregations because we're not a family in the way that we profess that we should be. CORNISH: This is where David Carlson breaks into the conversation. He's 17, he's white and 2020 will be his first election. He says the media is too focused on what he calls Trump's wild comments. DAVID CARLSON: The question was talking about whether, you know, we're having to have these uncomfortable conversations. And the answer is, absolutely. CORNISH: And I don't just mean race, by the way. That came up, but that's not the only thing, you know, you want to bring up. CARLSON: Absolutely. And I think if he would just shut his mouth, things would be so much better because if you look at the numbers, if you do look at what he's doing, we're seeing African American unemployment - actually, unemployment across the board - incredibly low. We're seeing the economy, the stock market incredibly high. The only problem with the Trump administration right now is really just his speaking. PEARLIE HODGES: Pearlie Hodges - several times it's been said, if he would just keep his mouth shut. Out of the heart, the mouth speaks. CORNISH: That's from the Bible in the New Testament, both books Matthew and Luke. Many in the room nod in recognition. HODGES: It's in his heart. That's why it's coming out. And I think one of the most important issues that we have to address is the divide - the racial divide. Money is good. You know, all of that is fine. But if we are destroyed as a nation, what does it matter? I mean, what really does it matter? It's hurtful. A president doesn't understand or a person from the South doesn't understand what the connotation of a Confederate flag is. It's hurtful. And some don't even want to know. So when you say, oh, it's heritage, no, it's hatred. CORNISH: So that's another sort of issue of the day. BELT: Or when the president defines his impeachment proceedings as a lynching. CARLSON: Lynching is an actual political term. BELT: I'm sorry. What? CORNISH: David Carlson jumps in again. CARLSON: Look. Lynching means a unjustified prosecution. It is not only about... BELT: Wow, young man. I was absolutely unaware of that. Thank you. Thank you for that bit of information. CARLSON: It's not only about the absolute, like, hanging of people and, specifically in the past, African American slaves. BELT: We're not even talking about African American slaves. Do you know who Emmett Till was, young man? CARLSON: Who? BELT: Emmett Till. CARLSON: Not off the top of my... BELT: Every black man in this room knows who Emmett Till is. If you know who Emmett Till is, you would not describe a political process as a lynching. CORNISH: The context here - there have been decades of efforts to improve racial integration, especially among some newer evangelical churches. But just last year, The New York Times reported on black worshippers leaving their churches, in part, due to the silence on Trump. In this room, it's Trump's comments on police brutality, protests in the NFL, insults of black lawmakers and the treatment of black demonstrators at his rallies. And the conversation goes back and forth about how and whether churches should address it. Again, black churchgoer Pearlie Hodges. HODGES: It's so divisive because no one wants to say Donald Trump is this or Donald Trump is that. We're afraid. CORNISH: All right. Here's 27-year-old youth pastor Andrew Clark. He's our host at Arran Lake Baptist Church. He says it's an open question about how and whether to talk about Trump and race. ANDREW CLARK: Going back to the original question, you were talking about political lines and then one party affiliating with a group versus another, if I remember correctly. We have to understand, I think, in the evangelical or in the Christian community, there is divisiveness there. There is divisiveness between racial lines. Absolutely. I think that's stuff that has been there, and I think that's stuff that we as - in the Christian community have done a poor job of coming around one another and gathering around the table and having those discussions. I think that racial reconciliation and things like that are very, very important. And I know we've said it in here. Yeah, there's - we are all and the same. But yeah, there is that tension. But we should run to that tension rather than run from it. And I think a lot of cases in the Christian community - we've ran from that tension rather than to address those issues and how we can be more about coming together. CORNISH: I end the conversation there because the divisions of race won't be solved here - not on a Tuesday night in the Bible study classroom of Arran Lake Baptist Church. We move on to politics, impeachment, why they fear Democrats. And after we wrap up, I say thanks, and they begin to leave. Then something else happens that I should have expected but, given the tense moments, didn't. They ask if they can pray. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Can we have a prayer before we leave? CORNISH: They join hands. Pastor William Neil takes the lead. WILLIAM NEIL: Let us pray. CORNISH: And with heads bowed, they set aside the tensions of the night. NEIL: We can differ without being indifferent, and we can disagree without being disagreeable. So we ask now that you would touch our hearts, that we leave here - we are free of all malice. We are free of anything that would hinder us from being lovable to one another. It is in that name, Jesus Christ, that we pray. Amen. UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE: Amen. CORNISH: That's William Neil, Andrew Clark, David Carlson, Marcus Belt, Pearlie Hodges and David Clarke, evangelical voters. We spoke to them in Fayetteville, N.C. And our stories from North Carolina were produced by Art Silverman. (SOUNDBITE OF GACHA BAKRADZE'S \"RIVER\") Copyright \u00a9 2019 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Two undecided voters John Zeitler, a 48-year-old attorney for an insurance company, and Hetal Jani, 36, who runs a nonprofit focused on education and mentorship, wanted to know more about the \"freedom dividend\" proposal from first-time presidential candidate Andrew Yang. The voters, along with Morning Edition host Noel King, sat down with Yang at a Midtown Manhattan dumpling shop called Baodega as part of Off Script, a series of interviews with 2020 presidential candidates. Listen to the group's conversation about the freedom dividend by clicking the audio button above. Watch the full conversation here. Entrepreneur and presidential hopeful Andrew Yang in the Chelsea neighborhood in Manhattan ahead of a meeting with undecided voters moderated by NPR.\n                \n                    \n                    A.J.

Yang, a tech entrepreneur and author, proposes that the government give every American adult $1,000 a month \u2014 a form of universal basic income, no strings attached. He says this income is necessary to address wide-scale job losses due to automation. It would help people have the resources to afford to look for work, care for a loved one, start a business or do nonprofit work. \"It's enough to be a game changer,\" Yang told the voters. \"But it's not meant to be a full work replacement, and it's certainly not meant to solve every problem.\" Those who wanted the dividend would give up any traditional welfare benefits they were getting \u2014 or they could just stick with their welfare payments. The dividend, Yang said, is like a \"foundation or a floor.\" \"You don't stop building a house on the floor. That's kind of a crummy house,\" he said. \"So first I would not want to get rid of any existing government programs. I would never be the sort of person that says like, 'Hey, there are millions of Americans relying upon something. Let's pull the rug out from under them.' \" Hetal Jani, founding executive director of SPEAK Mentorship and an undecided Democrat, wanted to hear more about Yang's \"freedom dividend\" proposal.\n                \n                    \n                    A.J.

The government would not specify how the universal basic income should be spent, and Jani wondered whether that could lead to bad decision-making. \"Do people always make the choices that we need them to make in order to get to the world that you're hoping to get to?\" \"If you get the freedom dividend in January and you buy a big TV, like maybe I wouldn't have bought that big TV, but you know, it's your decision, your resources. And then hopefully you'll make it \u2014 or not even hopefully \u2014 it's like you might make a different decision in February,\" he said. \"The benefit to me of putting this sort of agency and autonomy in people's hands far outweigh trying to direct it to very, very specific expenses. But I will say again that we still need to do a lot of work to address the real problems in our society on top of anything we're doing with the freedom dividend.\" John Zeitler, an undecided Democrat, wanted to know more about the value-added tax.\n                \n                    \n                    A.J.

Zeitler also wanted to know more about the value-added tax that Yang proposes to pay for it. Specifically, Zeitler wondered whether a 10% tax on goods and services that businesses produce was too regressive and whether wealthier Americans and corporations shouldn't shoulder more of a burden in a tax code restructuring. Yang agreed but said that the current tax system is \"being gamed to incredible degrees\" by corporations. \"So you have a trillion-dollar tech company like Amazon that's now closing 30% of America's stores and malls literally paying zero in taxes. And so you have to look around and say, 'OK, now that should not be,' \" Yang said. \"Because we're in an era of unprecedented technology and innovation, our data is now worth more than oil, as an example. And we're seeing none of that.

First elected in 2011, Buttigieg has based his presidential candidacy, in part, around the revival of South Bend that he's helped engineer. Updated at 3:26 p.m. ET When Molly Hewitt left South Bend, Ind., for college, she didn't think she'd return to live there again. Since the 1960s, the city had suffered the same brain drain that plagued many other Midwestern cities faced with industrial decline. \"The goal was always to be successful enough that you don't have to come back to South Bend,\" she said. But while she was away, things were turning around. Hewitt's parents kept her in the loop and she decided to give another chance to the city led by Democratic mayor Pete Buttigieg. \"I came back, honestly because of Pete and I've seen a lot of my friends do that and a lot of people who didn't grow up here that want to come to South Bend,\" she said. Now Hewitt is 23, living in South Bend and volunteering for the campaign of James Mueller, the candidate Buttigieg endorsed to replace him in this year's mayoral election. Buttigieg, 37, officially announced his candidacy for the presidency on Sunday. On the campaign trail he speaks a lot about how being mayor of South Bend since 2012 has prepared him to be president. \"We transformed the trajectory of our city,\" Buttigieg said in an interview on Morning Edition in January. \"This is a community that was written off as dying at the beginning of this decade. Now it's growing again.\" South Bend's population is up more than 1,000 people since 2010 following decades of hemorrhaging tens of thousands of residents. Investment in the city's downtown, public private partnerships, economic development \u2014 including turning the long vacant Studebaker auto plant, which closed its doors in 1963, into a tech hub \u2014 have been credited with the change. \"There's a definite difference in how it used to be versus how it is now,\" said Jake Mitchell, who went to high school with Buttigieg. \"Just kind of an intangible feeling. You know, everything seems nicer, cleaner.\" But others in this once-industrial town feel left out, despite what Buttigieg has done. \"You're doing a lot for downtown and you're building hotels and apartments that people who are native to this town can't even afford, even the people with college degrees,\" said activist Lisa DeBerry. \"So it's like, who are you developing that for?\" Early in his first term Buttigieg set a goal to knock down 1,000 blighted houses in a thousand days - which the city exceeded. \"And that's certainly helped,\" said Jack Colwell, a long time columnist for the South Bend Tribune. \"Neighborhoods where there had been these vacant houses they were drug houses, gangs used them, they were eyesores.\" A lot of the housing stock in South Bend comes from the heyday of the Studebaker plant, which employed thousands of workers. Now, most of the deteriorated neighborhoods are historically minority and lower income. And when the houses started coming down, teacher Regina Williams-Preston says she stepped up and got involved with others there. \"The people rose up and said, 'Hey, we need help out here. Don't knock down our communities, give us help. It's our tax dollars, invest in us,'\" she recalled. \"And that's when we got two million dollars of investment in home repair and two million more invested in new construction for affordable homes,\" added Williams-Preston, who is now a council member and is also running to replace Buttigieg as the mayor of South Bend when his second term ends Dec. 31. Williams-Preston said she felt that working with Buttigieg as a mayor, part of the job was preparing him for the next step. Jason Critchlow, another mayoral candidate, who used to be the county Democratic Party chair, said Buttigieg didn't turn the city around on his own. \"I think there's a feeling here that it's disingenuous to pretend that one person had solely to do with any of the progress made here in South Bend,\" Critchlow said. \"I think there's been literally decades of public servants that have gotten us to where we are today.\" And it's still far from a complete turnaround. More than a quarter of the population still lives at or below the poverty line, compared to the national average of around 14 percent. DeBerry, the activist, says Buttigieg shouldn't become president.\"That's like a mother having her own children and not taking care of them and then wants foster children,\" she said, expressing a feeling she says is shared by many who were left behind by the city's transformation. \"It's like no, we're not going to give you more.\" Williams-Preston says she hopes that if Buttigieg becomes president, he would take the lessons he learned in South Bend forward. \"You could really be like the president of the United States one day. It's up to us, like the people of South Bend to make sure you're ready for that task.\" Buttigieg was an improbable mayor \u2014 he was only 29 when he was first elected. And he's hoping his experience since then in South Bend will land him in another improbable place - the White House.",

            "article_content": "Americans owe about $1.6 trillion in student loan debt. That's about twice the current budget for the Defense Department and around 22 times the budget for the Education Department. About one in every six American adults owes money on a federal student loan. So it makes sense that candidates for the 2020 presidential election have proposed ways of dealing with this debt to allow millions of Americans to move on. Their proposals vary. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., says she would forgive \"up to $50,000 in student loan debt for 42 million Americans.\" Her plan would cancel up to $50,000 in debt for individuals with a household income of under $100,000. The plan wouldn't take away debt for people with a household income above $250,000. Those in the middle would have loans canceled based on how much they make \u2014 the more you earn, the less would be forgiven. Paying for it: Warren says she'd institute a tax on the wealthiest Americans to come up with the money for this. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders has proposed a seemingly simple plan: canceling student debt for all borrowers who carry it. He says it'll save $3,000 per year for the average borrower. Paying for it: Sanders says he'll create a \"Wall Street speculation tax,\" taxing stock, bond and derivative trades. These plans to eliminate debt come in tandem with proposals to decrease or eliminate college costs, which prompt questions of their own. But what, exactly, might happen if the government simply wiped out student loans? For one, it would cost a lot of money: Eliminating all student loan debt would cost somewhere around $1.6 trillion, though the exact cost is anyone's guess. Sanders says that his plan, which includes making all public colleges in the U.S. free, would cost $2.2 trillion. Warren's overall education plan \u2014 including free public college \u2014 would cost $1.25 trillion, she says. Her plan for loan forgiveness would cost about $640 billion, according to a report for her campaign, though the authors note that \"a precise estimate is challenging.\" Both Warren and Sanders say wiping out debt en masse would stimulate the economy. One 2018 study found that this could be true. The researchers, including a senior economic adviser to Sanders' presidential campaign, found that canceling all student debt would lift GDP and decrease unemployment. And recent research shows that loan cancellation has a big impact on borrowers already in default on their student loans. The authors studied what happened when a group of about 10,000 borrowers got their loans discharged from a private loan company. The company, National Collegiate, couldn't prove in court that it owned the debt it was trying to collect, freeing borrowers from paying back those loans. People moved, got new jobs and made more money when their loans were discharged, says Ankit Kalda, one of the study's co-authors. When loans are forgiven, he says, borrowers \"are also less likely to file for bankruptcy, or be foreclosed upon, or even default on their medical bills.\" But critics of mass debt cancellation plans fear that these proposals would benefit well-off Americans the most. That's because the people who take out the largest loans do so to pay for costly graduate degrees. While they might be expensive, these graduate degrees help borrowers earn a higher salary, so they don't have as much trouble paying back their debt. So, these borrowers default on their student loans less. The people who default on their loans have, on average, less than $10,000 in student loan debt. These people are more likely to be low income, black, former students of for-profit institutions and those who stopped taking classes before getting a degree. Eliminating all student debt, per Sanders' plan, would increase the wealth gap between white and black households, according to one 2015 study co-authored by left-leaning think tank Demos. (Two economists from Brandeis University who worked on the study co-authored an economic analysis for Warren's campaign this year.) To decrease the racial wealth gap, researchers at Demos have recommended a plan like Warren's, which eliminates more debt for borrowers who make less. But even Warren's proposal would aid folks who are less likely to struggle with paying back their loans. An analysis of her plan by Adam Looney of the Brookings Institution found that under her proposal, \"The bottom 20 percent of borrowers by income get only 4 percent of the savings.\" And, some economists fear that wiping out debt on a wide scale could contribute to the rising cost of college if students take out loans expecting debt forgiveness down the line. Already-pricey colleges would have no incentive to keep costs down. \"If we get into a system where people anticipate that their loans will be forgiven in the future, I think we're only going to see that problem exacerbated,\" Beth Akers of the conservative-leaning Manhattan Institute predicts. So what about simply improving on existing policies to ease the pain of student debt? \"We have fairly robust and generous loan forgiveness programs and income-driven repayment programs,\" says John Brooks, a professor at Georgetown University Law Center. Take the current system of income-driven repayment: For those enrolled, monthly payments are capped based on income, and depending on the plan, remaining loans are forgiven at the end of a 20- or 25-year period. But not many folks know about these plans, says Akers. \"It's not well understood by people who are thinking and talking about policy change,\" she says. \"It's also not well understood by the borrowers who could potentially benefit from the program.\" Some candidates are thinking about it though: Former Housing Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro says if he were elected, he would reform the repayment system, capping loan payments at zero for borrowers earning under 250% of the federal poverty line \u2014 $31,225 for a single-person household in 2019.",

Athena Kolbe is an assistant professor of social work at the University of North Carolina, Wilmington. Robert Muggah is the co-founder of the Igarap\u00e9 Institute in Brazil, and the SecDev Group in Canada. The stench of burning tires is hard to escape. Haiti's capital, Port-au-Prince, is again littered with smoldering barricades. Towns across the country are in lockdown. Over a million people took to the streets this month in protest, effectively shutting the nation of nearly 11 million people down. Demonstrations turned violent amid accusations that Haitian officials pillaged a multibillion-dollar Petrocaribe development fund subsidized by Venezuela. The opposition is calling for President Jovenel Moise to resign. But Moise is defiant, insisting that he \"will not leave the country in the hands of armed gangs and drug traffickers.\" Haiti has been seized by demonstrations over the past year. Grievances range from the skyrocketing costs of food and gas to crippling austerity and elite graft and impunity. Oddly, the Haitian administration and the foreign donor governments funding it have seemed stunned with every new protest. The Petrocaribe fund scandal, however, is pushing the fragile country to the edge. Kot K\u00f2b Petwo Karibe a ??? ..Yon katon, yon plim, epi mande palman an kot k\u00f2b la! @SenatHaitien @deputeshaitiens @moisejovenel ..#KotK\u00f2bPetwoKaribea#PetwoKaribe#PetroCaribe pic.twitter.com/Eb0L4QVvdW Last year, deep-seated anger escalated into stone-throwing encounters between protesters and police officers. The rage erupted online in August, when Haitian-Canadian videographer Gilbert Mirambeau posted a tweet in which he appears blindfolded and asks the simple question in Haitian Creole: \"Kot K\u00f2b Petwo Karibe a ???\" \u2014 where is the Petrocaribe money? Petrocaribe was launched over a decade ago as a way for Caribbean and Central American countries to buy discounted oil and receive credit financing from Venezuela. Funding from the program was expected to pay for education, health, agriculture and infrastructure projects. The scale of alleged theft in Haiti is breathtaking. A 2017 Haitian Senate report said that, between 2008 and 2016, money generated by the oil-purchasing program was misused, misappropriated and embezzled by dozens of government officials and heads of private firms. In January, an auditor's report concluded that almost $2 billion was diverted from the fund. A company tied to President Moise was accused of receiving irregular payments before he took office. Moise and the other current and former officials vehemently deny the accusations. The initial report led Moise to fire his cabinet chief and 15 government advisers, but he did not require them to admit guilt. Under pressure from the opposition, the government said last month it would deepen investigations into alleged corruption. But Haitians are outraged by the slow pace of the investigations and lack of arrests of senior politicians and business people. The scandal is all the more jarring given Haiti's sharp economic and social disparities. Close to 60 percent of Haitians live below the poverty line of $2.41 a day. Two years ago, a bag of basic staples such as rice, beans, cooking oil and vegetables could be purchased for around $10. According to a monitoring system we set up back in 2004, the same basket of goods today is $19.60, almost double the price. The costs of everything from water and kerosene to transportation and school fees are soaring. Haiti's already unreliable electrical grid is falling apart: areas that once received a few hours of electricity a day are now going days or weeks without access to energy. Across the country shops and banks are closing. Haiti's historical struggle for democracy should not be forgotten in today's crisis. The country stunned the world when it became the first independent black republic in 1804 after expelling France and abolishing slavery. But Haiti was alternately shunned, raided and occupied by Western powers until the mid-20th century. The nation, which shares the island of Hispaniola with the Dominican Republic, endured brutal dictatorships and coups before pulling off free and fair elections in 1990, though their first elected leader would also be deposed twice. Although Haiti has survived devastating disasters, including an earthquake in 2010 that claimed at least 158,000 lives, and a cholera epidemic started by United Nations peacekeepers, the country has struggled to establish strong democratic institutions. In 2017, Haiti was considered stable enough for the U.N. peacekeeping mission to end its 13-year tenure. It left behind a handful of advisers to train the national police and strengthen the criminal justice system. Despite several major setbacks, the mission is credited with helping restore a modicum of democratic rule. Yet the current president is viewed by most ordinary Haitians as an illegitimate leader who stole the election from his opponents. This was confirmed during surveys of more than 1,700 Haitians we conducted for the Igarap\u00e9 Institute, a Brazilian think tank, during the 2015 and 2016 presidential elections which pitted Moise, a businessman, against Jude C\u00e9lestin, a political moderate who was popular across Haiti's divided classes. Moise was declared the winner in November 2016 and assumed the presidency in February 2017. We found that faith in the voting system and democracy overall was adversely affected by voter intimidation and fraud. We also witnessed widespread voting irregularities firsthand, including ballot stuffing. President Moise's victory was confounding for several reasons. Back in 2015, just before the first presidential election, we asked respondents which of the two candidates they preferred: 91 percent selected C\u00e9lestin. At the time, just 3 percent of the adults we randomly surveyed said they planned to vote. Instead, many said the entire process was bankrupt and that voting was neither free nor fair. Roughly 19 percent of the respondents said there was \"no point\" in voting, 15 percent feared violence at the polls, and 13 percent said they wouldn't vote because \"politicians don't care about people like me.\" In the end, few Haitians turned up to vote in 2015 \u2014 just 18 percent of eligible voters, according to election officials. After the 2015 vote was nullified due to accusations of fraud, a second election was held in 2016, and just 21 percent of voters showed up. In the end, the provisional electoral council determined that over 55 percent chose Moise and only 19 percent selected C\u00e9lestin. In the wake of the second election, voters were significantly less likely to agree with the statement that \"in a democracy voting is important because it determines who leads the country.\" It is possible to improve the resilience of Haiti's democracy. This will require strengthening Haitian institutions and ensuring that international aid helps, and does not hinder, the country's democratic institutions. At a minimum, a priority must be put on expanding the number of women running for office, on assisting local civic groups \u2014 especially youth organizations \u2014 that work to promote peaceful electoral processes and on strengthening independent vote monitoring. A goal must also be to empower accountable legislatures, judiciaries and civil rights groups. They have the potential to exert a powerful check on executive power and corrupt businesses, and wrest back control from the elite. The Petrocaribe imbroglio ignited a popular movement demanding change \u2014 and it may signal a turning point for Haiti. For years, democracy in the country has been tenuous, with rampant corruption and economic barriers to participation largely to blame. Most Haitians are disillusioned and don't believe their leaders are truly doing what is best for citizens. Until they do, streets will keep burning. The country's protests will only end after all Haitians are confident that their voices really count. The real question is whether the country's elites and donor community are prepared to let that happen.",

Samira Gutoc cannot help but stand out from the crowded roster of candidates in the Philippines' midterm elections. The ebullient 44-year-old is a Muslim, and the only woman among the opposition's slate of eight candidates running for the Senate. Half of the 24 seats in the upper chamber and all of the 297 seats in the House of Representatives will be chosen in Monday's polling. The Elections Commission says 62 million voters have registered, and if history is any guide, more than 70% of them will turn out. Rodrigo Duterte, the populist president whose off-color remarks equally repel and attract Filipinos, is not on the ballot. But the election is very much a verdict on his first three years in office. The 74-year-old president has crisscrossed the country for the Senate hopefuls of his coalition and promoted his signature policy on the campaign trail. In stop after stop, Duterte \u2014 who won the presidency on a tough law-and-order platform \u2014 rarely missed the chance to warn anyone in the illegal drug trade, \"If you destroy my country, I will kill.\" It's a promise he has made good on. Authorities say nearly 5,300 drug suspects have been killed in police operations since Duterte took office in July 2016.  Rights groups believe the official figure is a gross understatement of the drug war's carnage.

Gutoc herself is no anti-Duterte crusader. A women's rights advocate, she seems to have cultivated the ability to get along with the sometime-obstreperous president, and still challenge him. Duterte has refrained from criticizing her in the campaign, while showing no such restraint for the rest of the opposition lineup. Gutoc's run is a bid to end a 20-year absence of a Muslim in the Philippine Senate. Senatorial candidates must run nationwide, and she's running in a country that is 92% Christian. Again, she'll get no argument from Duterte. Born and raised a Catholic, he routinely attacks the church and its teachings. But he exhibits equanimity toward the Muslim community, which makes up 5% of the population, and he has often spoken of his own maternal grandmother's Muslim heritage. Gutoc's faith does not appear to be an issue in the campaign. She generates more of a stir as the only woman among the male-dominated lineup of opposition senatorial candidates known as \"Otso Diretso\" or \"Straight Eight,\" which is how they would like voters to mark their ballots. Just days before Gutoc and her fellow opposition hopefuls close their six-week campaign, they careen between visits with coconut farmers and social service groups at a local cathedral and a serenaded lunch. She sways to the music at campaign stops to the delight of the crowds in the Philippine song-and-dance political culture. She slurps noodles from a banana leaf with farmers and, in the next breath, chides Duterte. Gutoc gently jabs him for not confronting China over its aggression in the South China Sea, which has hurt Filipino fishermen and which she calls a sellout. \"If you are bowing to China,\" she tells NPR, speaking of Duterte, \"you should bow more to your own fisher folk or farmers. People who are prejudicing our future are [on] the other side.\" Duterte has attacked her opposition Liberal Party, accusing it of plotting to oust him. He has tagged politicians of all stripes with involvement in the illegal drug trade, publishing a \"narco list\" of names of officials, mayors and other politicians who he says are involved in the drug trade. Human rights lawyers call it a violation of due process, and critics say it amounts to a political hit list. Instead of making accusations at campaign rallies, Gutoc asks aloud, \"Why don't you figure out issues like poverty?\" Her answer: \"Election time [is] character assassination time.\" She says fear of retribution has kept local officials from endorsing the opposition. Where Gutoc is willing to stand up to the president, whose attacks on free expression and women have done little to dent his high approval ratings, she has garnered a following. Her candidacy can be seen as part rejoinder to Duterte's demeaning rhetoric on women.

At rallies, she is the fiery fresh face breaking Muslim stereotypes. She can break out into song about the loneliness of Filipinos who work overseas \u2014some 2.3 million citizens. As the daughter of a diplomat raised in Saudi Arabia, Gutoc recalls hosting Filipino \"families of workers who had no homes. I saw their pain,\" she says. A lawyer by training, Gutoc has worked as a civic leader advocating for women, the environment and marginalized groups. She returned two decades ago to her native Mindanao, the main southern island in the Philippine archipelago that is also home to many of the country's Muslims. Gutoc, who wears a headscarf wrapped turban-like around her head, served as a member of the Regional Legislative Assembly of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao. She  She told Esquire Philippines that she's working hard to help \"improve the lives of my family, my community, my people.\" She herself is now exiled from her hometown of Marawi, the city on restive Mindanao that was laid waste in 2017 when Philippine government troops battled ISIS-linked militants who had dug into the city. Gutoc led volunteers in rescuing residents trapped during the five-month siege, an experience that animates her belief she can serve. \"It's one motivation that compels me to be in the public eye, because I can talk about their struggle,\" she says. \"And it's also the struggle of anyone [trying] to find a house and shelter and safety.\" Duterte had jokingly exhorted soldiers to commit rape during the Marawi siege. Gutoc called a remark offensive and quit a local peace panel to which Duterte had appointed her. In the campaign, she sounds the alarm about rape in a country where police data show on average a woman is sexually assaulted every 72 minutes. \"We have got to band together, join together and file a claim against that bastard who did it to us,\" she roars before an audience at De La Salle University in Manila. Her call to report rape resonates. Michele Orbeta, 21, says, \"When she opened up about that during the forum, I could tell \u2014 especially amongst my fellow students \u2014 it really got everyone's attention.\" As she campaigns, women of all ages reach out to Gutoc, hugging her and ambushing her for selfies. Marino Amado, 67, is among them. The retired bank manager is ecstatic over meeting Gutoc and, like many, finds Duterte's disparaging remarks about women distasteful. Amado says lack of equality is the most entrenched problem for women, and she sees Gutoc as a counterpoint to the president's swagger. \"We don't like our ... president, and only Samira Gutoc ... will fight for us,\" she says. The opposition slate has faced the money and the machinery of their Duterte-allied rivals, and polls this past week showed they had not broken through to the electorate. Despite Gutoc's obvious appeal, her biggest hurdle in Monday's election may be name recognition. But on the ballot, each candidate is assigned a number that corresponds to their name. Hers is \"36,\" and with a little self-deprecation, she hopes to lodge it in the voters' minds. \"Thirty-six is my ballot number,\" the stout Gutoc tells audiences, \"and my waistline.\"",

When Air Force One touches down at Moffett Field in Mountain View, Calif., Tuesday morning, President Trump will be heading \"behind enemy lines,\" as one supporter called the president's first trip to the San Francisco Bay Area since being elected. Even so, Trump's re-election campaign and Republican Party coffers will be stuffed with cash when he leaves the state on Wednesday. While Trump is treated as a kind of devil incarnate by Democratic officials and many of the state's voters, he's not without support, even in deep-blue California. \"He's very popular here,\" said Republican National Committeewoman Harmeet Dhillon from San Francisco. It was Dhillon who described California as the \"enemy\" in a recent New York Times article, but as one of the organizers of Tuesday's lunchtime fundraiser, she's found plenty of friends of the president here. \"The event is sold out, and I could have sold 100 more seats if I had them,\" Dhillon said. She wouldn't disclose the exact location of the event, citing security reasons, but said it's somewhere south of San Francisco and will attract \"a few hundred\" people, some paying $100,000 or more for a chance to see Trump in person. She noted that donors will be attending from as far away as Reno, Nev., as well as from Yuba, Kings and Sacramento counties. Trump will head to a similar fundraiser in Beverly Hills Tuesday afternoon. Asked what California donors like about Trump, Dhillon listed his taking the fight to Democrats, \"unlike these RINOs (Republican In Name Only)\" in Washington, D.C., and also his \"America First\" rhetoric and tax cuts, although she acknowledged many wealthy Californians are unhappy about the GOP tax bill which places limits on allowable federal deductions for state and local taxes. Dhillon, who was born in India, added that \"some immigrants like me really like his positions on illegal immigration.\" Blaming Democrats for California's homeless crisis Although the administration isn't saying much about the president's upcoming remarks, Trump is sure to use his California visit to continue bashing the state's liberal policies, which he says have contributed to the number of homeless people on the streets. Last week, Trump administration officials visited Los Angeles to inspect the city's infamous skid row. There were reports the officials also toured federal facilities that could potentially be used to house the homeless. While that might sound good to Democrats coming from, say, former President Barack Obama, anything this president does is viewed with grave suspicion by his political opponents in California. Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom on Monday released a pointed letter to the president, suggesting that if he really wanted to address homelessness, he would help Californians get out of poverty and invest in things like mental health and affordable housing. \"In contrast,\" Newsom wrote, \"your administration has proposed significant cuts to public housing and programs like the Community Development Block Grant.\" The letter, signed by Sacramento Mayor Darrell Steinberg on behalf of big city mayors, suggests three specific steps to help prevent homelessness, including providing \"50,000 more vouchers to provide rental subsidies for the poor, and an increase in the value of the vouchers to reflect the high cost of housing in California.\" At a press conference in Sacramento Monday, Newsom said the letter was sent \"not with a clenched fist but an open hand.\" While Trump is not expected to go to San Francisco proper, Ben Carson, his secretary of Housing and Urban Development, will visit the city Tuesday. San Francisco's coordinator of homeless programs Jeff Kozitsky, told KQED he believes Carson will visit a \"Hope SF\" public housing development in the Potrero Hill neighborhood, where local bond money and federal funds have been used to rebuild dilapidated housing for low-income San Franciscans. Kozitsky, who has met with Carson previously, said he welcomes more federal attention to the homeless problem, which has festered and frustrated city officials and residents for decades. \"We really need to refocus our energy on the root cause of this problem which is a lack of affordable housing,\" Kozitsky said. \"In terms of practical things that the government could be doing right here right now, investing more in affordable housing is what's really needed if we're ever going to get a handle on this nationally.\" That sentiment was echoed by San Francisco Mayor London Breed, who has tried, with mixed results, to lower barriers to construction of affordable housing in a city where citizen objections can slow, shrink or even kill affordable housing projects. \"I'm open to anything that's going to help get people permanently housed,\" Breed said. \"What that entails, from my perspective, is getting more housing built and providing subsidies to get housing built. It takes money to get them built.\"",

A day after a historic election, Chicago Mayor-elect Lori Lightfoot laid out what she sees as some of the city's most pernicious problems: entrenched segregation, gun violence and economic inequality. Lightfoot, the first black woman chosen to hold the position, emphasized the \"fractured relationship\" between the Chicago Police Department and the public as a critically important safety issue. The nature of policing by the department \"has not adequately taken into account the segregation in our city and that race does matter,\" she said in an interview with NPR's Morning Edition. That disconnect \"has left many people feeling like the police are an illegitimate occupying force and we've got to change that around because literally lives depend on it.\" Lightfoot, a 56-year-old former federal prosecutor who has worked in police oversight but never held elected office, said tensions in Chicago were exacerbated because the mayoral race unfolded as three police officers went on trial over accusations that they helped cover up what happened in the fatal shooting of black teenager Laquan McDonald by a white officer in 2015. The officer who fired the fatal shots, Jason Van Dyke, had already been convicted, but the three other officers were cleared of any wrongdoing in January \u2014 a stunning blow to McDonald's family and civil rights advocates across the country. Lightfoot told NPR that prosecutors should re-examine the not-guilty verdicts. \"I've urged the U.S. Attorney's Office, my former colleagues, to reopen their grand jury investigation and if they determine that there are no civil rights violations they can bring, they need to have a fulsome grand jury report,\" she said. \"We've got to have transparency and healing so that people are able to move on,\" the mayor-elect added. Lightfoot also touched on the issue of economic disparity in Chicago that has led to a lack of opportunity for lower-income people. \"We need to make sure that we are bringing real hope and economic opportunity to so many neighborhoods that have been disinvested in for decades,\" she said. \"Building channels for people to believe that the city sees them and hears them and is willing to invest, is going to be critically important, and we have to start that right away.\" Lightfoot, who also will be Chicago's first openly gay mayor, won Tuesday's runoff election against Cook County Board president and county Democratic Party leader Toni Preckwinkle. Both African-American women ran as progressives outside the sphere of Chicago's well-moneyed political machine. As member station WBEZ reported, \"The free-for-all campaign represented a sharp contrast to almost every past election in a city that has been synonymous with Democratic machine politics and bossism for nearly a century.\" Lightfoot replaces Rahm Emanuel, a nationally prominent Democrat who withdrew from running for a third mayoral term. As she prepares to step into her new role, Lightfoot said she is struck by the magnitude of the moment. \"I think that the people who come from communities like me as an African-American woman, as a member of the LGBT community, we haven't sat in the corners of power,\" she said. \"It's quite the opposite. We've been discriminated against. We've been locked out, and we've been excluded. And to have someone like me representing these multifaceted communities now be on the cusp of being the mayor and what I think is the greatest city in the world, I think gives a lot of people a lot of hope \u2014 and it is a milestone in a long journey that will continue to demonstrate though that we're making progress.\" Lightfoot added, \"Breaking the back of the Chicago machine, it's quite monumental.\"",

            "article_content": "Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., is in Iowa this weekend, kicking off her bid for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.  MICHEL MARTIN, HOST: Even as the government in Washington, D.C., is mostly shut down, the 2020 campaign is well underway in Iowa. Democrats there will not pick a presidential candidate in the caucuses for 13 months. But, this weekend, Elizabeth Warren, the senator from Massachusetts, is making her first trip across the state since announcing her exploratory presidential committee on New Year's Eve. NPR political correspondent Asma Khalid is in Des Moines, where Warren is appearing today. Hi, Asma. ASMA KHALID, BYLINE: Hey, Michel. MARTIN: So what are the voters hearing from her? KHALID: Well, I would say if you were to drill down Sen. Warren's campaign message to really just one central theme, it is this idea that the middle class is under attack, you know, largely because of corporate greed and corruption. She told the crowd, actually, at one stop that pretty much all of her adult career has been spent around trying to figure out this one question - that what is happening to working families in America. You know, Michel, I think, you know, she is probably best known as a senator from New England, but what I've seen here in Iowa is that she's really getting a chance to introduce herself as she wants. And so she's been talking a lot more about her childhood in Oklahoma, how her dad had a heart attack. And she describes this as being what she thought was a personal story but years later realized it was actually a story about government because she says, you know, back when her mom got this job, minimum wage job, you could support a family of three. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ELIZABETH WARREN: You could pay a mortgage, you could keep the utilities on and you could put food on the table. Today, a minimum wage job in America full-time will not keep a mama and a baby out of poverty. And that is wrong, and it's why I'm in this fight. (APPLAUSE) KHALID: And, Michel, really that is kind of the crux that we've been hearing from her in Iowa. You know, she talks for about 15-20 minutes and then takes questions from the audience. She's been fairly open about taking a whole wide range of questions from people in the crowd. MARTIN: Including from reporters. KHALID: Including from reporters, which is rather notable because I would say she is one senator who's been rather notorious for her aversion to talking to the press as a senator. MARTIN: Well, one of the other things that she's known for is her willingness to take on President Trump. And the two of them have had some notable scuffles, particularly on Twitter. How is she handling that on the trail? KHALID: You're right. You know, Michel, the president, President Trump, has this history of calling Elizabeth Warren Pocahontas, right? These are over her claims of native ancestry. And so she did this DNA test that really sort of backfired on her. She was slammed by some tribal leaders for this. This morning in Sioux City was the first time I'd really directly heard this. A question was asked by a woman in the crowd to Elizabeth Warren. And this person asked, you know, why would you do this DNA test and give Donald Trump more fodder to be a bully? And the senator reiterated the fact that she is not a person of color. She is not a citizen of any tribe. But she says she put this all out there because it's a line of attack Republicans have been using, and she feels like she just needed to address this. And then she said this, actually, though, more specifically about President Trump. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) WARREN: Now, I can't stop Donald Trump from what he's going to do. I can't stop him from hurling racial insults. I don't have any power to do that. MARTIN: OK, Asma. And she doesn't seem to be talking to the president sort of directly that often. But was this an unusual approach for her? KHALID: You know, I would say that in general, it was kind of an unusual approach because she doesn't really - she hasn't actually attacked the president directly since she announced her intention to run for president. You know, she's constantly - I would say consciously been distancing herself from this and really just been trying to focus on the economy and how bad things are in the economy and how they can be fixed. MARTIN: We only have a couple of seconds left, though. I just wanted to ask you whether the Democratic voters there seem excited about what's - what is to come. She's certainly not the last candidate they'll be hearing from. KHALID: No. I mean, there's going to be some two dozen candidates who are Democrats likely to jump in. And, Michel, I would say the constant thing I've been hearing from people is they're looking for someone who's electable, somebody who can beat Donald Trump. That is probably the most constant response. MARTIN: All right. That's NPR's Asma Khalid on the campaign trail in Des Moines, Iowa, using that good campaign trail technology.

The election is set for Oct. 20.\n                \n                    \n                    Noah Friedman-Rudovsky/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Bolivian President Evo Morales (right) with Vice President \u00c1lvaro Garc\u00eda Linera launch their campaign for reelection in Chimore, Cochabamba department, Bolivia on May 18. The election is set for Oct. 20. After he was reelected to a third term in 2014, President Evo Morales attended a symbolic swearing-in ceremony at the ancient ruins of Tiwanaku in western Bolivia, wearing an embroidered gown and headdress of an Incan emperor. Now, as Bolivia's first president of Indigenous descent attempts to win a fourth consecutive term in the Oct. 20 election, critics contend that Morales is acting more like an emperor than a president. They point to his decision last year to move his office and government ministries into a luxurious new skyscraper in La Paz. The 29-story building, which features a jacuzzi, a sauna and a heliport on the roof, towers over the colonial-style buildings in the capital's historical district. Approaching 14 years in office, Morales is already the longest-serving president in Bolivian history, while his Movement Toward Socialism party controls all branches of government as well as much of the Bolivian media. And now he is pushing the legal envelope to remain in power. In 2016, Morales tried to amend Bolivia's constitution so he could run for a fourth term but voters narrowly rejected the proposal in a referendum. Rather than accept the result, Morales appealed to the nation's highest court which, according to analysts, is packed with the president's allies. The judges ruled that Morales' reelection bid could proceed on the grounds that the president's human rights would have been violated were he not allowed on the ballot. \"Of course Morales should not be a candidate, but that's the way dictators operate,\" says Mar\u00eda \u00c1ngela Alvizuri, 38, a La Paz homemaker, as she stared at the presidential skyscraper. Diego Ayo, a newspaper columnist and opposition activist, says Morales is starting to resemble other elected presidents in Latin America who are turning increasingly authoritarian \u2014 like Daniel Ortega in Nicaragua and Nicol\u00e1s Maduro in Venezuela. Under Morales \"we have had a gradual deterioration of democracy,\" he says. \"It would be really naive to say that we are in a democracy just because we hold elections.\" But to supporters, Morales has ushered in a Bolivian renaissance after years of violent street protests, political turmoil and economic depressions in South America's poorest country. Between 2003 and 2005 \u2014 the year Morales was first elected \u2014 Bolivia cycled through three presidents. A former union organizer and a member of the Aymara Indigenous group, Morales, 59, has ushered in a rare period of political stability while his decision to partially nationalize the country's vital natural gas industry helped make its economy one of the fastest growing in Latin America. Morales was twice reelected by landslides in a country where more than 40% of the population is Indigenous. \"Many people see themselves in Morales and see that their children may be able to be president,\" says Gonzalo Mendieta, a political analyst in La Paz. \"That still has a lot of power in Bolivia.\" From left: Justina Loza and Juan Condori.\n                \n                    \n                    John Otis for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption From left: Justina Loza and Juan Condori. His appeal is apparent in the town of Tiwanaku, which sits about two hours from La Paz next to the ruins where Morales was sworn in. Like the president, most of the 800 or so residents here are Aymara Indians. One of them, Juan Condori, owns a small plot of land on the outskirts of the village where he grows lettuce and celery. A government program helped him and dozens of neighboring farmers build greenhouses, which have helped them harvest more vegetables that they sell in La Paz. \"I like this government and want it to continue,\" Condori says. \"I don't know where all this talk about Morales being a dictator comes from. If he were a dictator, bullets would be flying. There would be political prisoners and a state of siege. But this government doesn't do that.\" Tiwanaku is also home to a new soccer stadium, a high school and a remodeled health clinic, projects that were funded by the Morales government. As she walks through the village, Justina Loza, a local artist, says that previous presidents ignored Bolivia's Indigenous people. But as an Aymara Indian, she says, Morales \"is always going to help us.\" Still, after years of economic expansion driven largely by the region's demand for its natural gas and China's hunger for its minerals, Bolivia's economy is slowing. Government corruption scandals as well as the president's decision to ignore the results of the referendum, have tarnished his image, according to analysts. In addition, his government was perceived as slow to respond to massive fires that have burned more than 6 million acres of forest and savanna in eastern Bolivia. Morales remains the front-runner, however, several polls show Carlos Mesa, a centrist former president and the main opposition candidate, gaining ground. The most recent survey by La Paz daily P\u00e1gina Siete showed Morales with 33%, Mesa with 26% and \u00d3scar Ortiz, a senator from eastern Santa Cruz state, in third place with 9%. \"I recognize the positive things\" that Morales has brought to Bolivia, Mesa tells NPR. But he says a fourth term would be illegal and turn Morales into \"an authoritarian strongman.\" To avoid a December runoff, Morales must garner at least 40% of the vote and top his closest rival by at least 10 points. Morales argues that voters should give him that margin and let him finish a job he started when he took office in 2006. In one TV campaign spot, he looks directly into the camera and declares: \"The country is doing well. But we need five more years.\"",

Jerry Brown, left, and Governor-elect Gavin Newsom emerge from the Governor's office to talk with reporters after meeting at the Capitol. Newsom will be sworn into office Monday Jan. 7, 2019. Depending on how you interpreted Gavin Newsom's campaign slogan \"Courage For a Change,\" he either has more courage than Jerry Brown \u2014 his campaign says that's not what they meant \u2014 or that Newsom has the courage needed to bring about big changes. For a man who often struggled to win Brown's praise or even his attention, it's an attempt to promise fresh ideas and perhaps a willingness to embrace issues the outgoing governor left for others, such as single-payer health care. Either way, Newsom could be challenged by a possible economic downturn and a newly emboldened California Legislature with massive majorities in both houses. \"If you're looking for timidity, I'm not your person,\" Newsom said before the election. \"If you're looking for someone to be bold and courageous, lean into issues, change the order of things, I'm committing myself to that cause as the next governor.\" Newsom takes office Monday, bringing to the state capital a very different style and set of priorities. Journalists often referred to Gov. Jerry Brown as \"the adult in the room\" when he huddled with legislators to close their differences. It was not a label legislators much cared for. \"I would resent it, too, if I was the Legislature,\" Brown told KQED, insisting he never said that. The governor said he expected legislators would push back against the next governor in ways they did not with him. When he became governor in 2011, Brown said legislators were willing to embrace a cooperative approach partially because the economy was bad. He added that he appreciated how lawmakers worked with him to solve problems and to compromise when necessary. \"As things get easier, then people get more restive, and I think there is a desire for the Legislature to assert [itself],\" Brown said. \"Gavin will have his challenges, but he's older now than I was when I left the first time,\" he said, referring to the end of his second term in 1983. Brown said Newsom's age and experience will serve him well. Over the years, Newsom has shown a tendency to get out in front of issues. In February 2004, he had been mayor of San Francisco for about a month when he made a bold \u2014 some would say reckless \u2014 decision to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. For weeks on end, hundreds of couples from all over the state and nation lined up to get married. The California Supreme Court soon put a stop to the weddings, but four years later, it ruled 4-3 that preventing same-sex couples from marrying violated the state constitution. It helped pave the way for a U.S. Supreme Court decision 10 years later legalizing same-sex marriage nationwide. To his growing number of supporters, it also signaled Newsom's willingness to push the envelope. \"I think he's a risk taker, and I think he's a true intellectual believer in the notion that you can fail fast as long as you're moving forward,\" says Joyce Newstat, Newsom's policy director in the early part of his mayoralty. Newsom's penchant for taking risks may have its roots in his childhood. He was not a particularly good student and was eventually diagnosed with dyslexia. Figuring out how to compensate for that learning disability was a gift, he says. \"You know, nothing was rote, nothing was linear. I had to work around things, work differently, see the world differently,\" Newsom told KQED. \"It allowed me to think outside the box. I've always been willing to take risks because you have to because you're never going to thrive in the more traditional sense.\" Whether it was outside the box thinking, political courage or just trying to keep his name in the headlines while he was lieutenant governor, Newsom helped lay the groundwork for a statewide ballot measure legalizing the recreational use of marijuana. \"I think Gavin Newsom has demonstrated a really deep understanding of where the zeitgeist is going,\" says technology forecaster and Stanford University professor, Paul Saffo. He sees Newsom as fitting in well with the attitude of innovators in Silicon Valley. Saffo says Newsom seems to share what he calls their disrespect for authority. \"The entrepreneurs' creed is that it's always easier to ask for forgiveness than to ask for permission.\" That tendency in Newsom was not always appreciated. After his first marriage fell apart, he had an affair with a top aide's wife. Some felt he often seemed bored being mayor; spending too much time thinking about his political future including a run for governor a decade ago. \"I'm relieved that he didn't become governor earlier,\" Paul Saffo says, adding that Newsom's eight years watching political master Jerry Brown will give him a better sense of when to lead and when to follow. \"I suspect going into this governorship he's gonna understand that timing better than ever. At age 51, Gavin Newsom is 30 years younger than the outgoing Gov. Jerry Brown and totally different in style and temperament. \"This transition is really a passing of the torch, not just of one governor to another but from one generation to another,\" says former California Gov. Gray Davis. \"It's great that they have different styles. It's almost by necessity you have to govern for the times.\" Newsom is taking over a state whose economy is the fifth largest in the world, and he has ambitions to match. California has the nation's highest rate of childhood poverty, which Newsom wants to address. He also wants to reform the health care system and provide government-subsidized child care. But he can't do it alone. He'll need help from people like Democratic Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon. Rendon and Newsom haven't always seen eye to eye. Asked about Newsom's ambitious agenda, Rendon says that compared to Brown \u2014 who focused on climate change, fiscal stability and criminal justice reform \u2014 the new governor has a wider range of policy interests. \"Which I guess makes a lot of sense at the beginning of an administration,\" Rendon says. Rendon declined to compare Newsom to Brown, saying only that \"they're both exceptionally thoughtful leaders.\" As Brown prepares to exit, he's leaving the state flush with cash, including a rainy day fund of $14 billion. Brown's parting piece of advice for Newsom? \"Don't screw it up.\"",

Though the Trump administration has since slashed the outreach budget, about 930,000 people have signed up for ACA health plans so far this year.\n                \n                    \n                    Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Enrollment help was plentiful for insurance sign-ups in the early years of the Affordable Care Act, such as at this clinic in Bear, Del., in 2014. Though the Trump administration has since slashed the outreach budget, about 930,000 people have signed up for ACA health plans so far this year. During Wednesday night's Democratic presidential debate, candidates touched on \"Medicare for All,\" \"Medicare for all who want it\" and other ways to reform the American health system. But in the backdrop, it's once again sign-up season for Affordable Care Act health plans. Despite repeated efforts by Republicans in Congress to undo the ACA, the controversial law's seventh open-enrollment period launched earlier this month to relatively little fanfare. It ends Dec. 15. Individual plans for 2020 are cheaper \u2014 premiums are lower, on average, and in some areas, people who qualify for government subsidies could end up with no monthly payment. Do check the fine print of your policy; in some cases, the patient's share of other costs may have gone up. Meanwhile, a pending court case threatens to overturn the entire law, with no clear replacement plan in the works. The result has been a cloud of confusion and misunderstanding \u2014 some even say misinformation \u2014 about the availability of this health coverage. Here's what consumers need to know. The ACA is intact \u2014 at least for now The Affordable Care Act is still the law of the land. The GOP-led Congress gutted a key part of the law \u2014 the penalty for the individual mandate \u2014 that required everyone to have coverage. But other key tenets of the ACA remain in place, including the individual marketplace it created where people can shop for health coverage. You might not hear much about that this year. The Trump administration has dramatically scaled back its outreach and marketing budget for open enrollment \u2014 allotting about $10 million for such efforts, compared with the more than $100 million the Obama administration spent. Lack of outreach, combined with Republican efforts to overturn or undermine the law, could give consumers a wrong impression, says Katie Keith, a health policy consultant who frequently writes about the health law. So far, about 930,000 people have signed up for coverage. That's still slightly lower than where things were last year \u2014 and first-day website glitches may have played a role, suggests Sabrina Corlette, a research professor at Georgetown University's Center on Health Insurance Reforms. In the second week of the sign-up period, enrollment was about 10% below what it was in last year's second week \u2014 but the number of new customers has gone up. \"The irony is, things are really stable, and depending on your state, you can really save,\" Keith says. \"Without advertising and information, folks are going to miss out on the deals they could get.\" You can get a cheaper plan this year, but it will probably require a bit of work Those deals can be pretty significant. On average, premiums are down 4% nationally over last year for silver-level plans sold through the federal marketplace. In some states, they're even cheaper. Many people don't realize that if their incomes are below 400% of the federal poverty level (just under $50,000 for an individual or about $103,000 for a family of four) they qualify for federal subsidies \u2014 tax credits that help them pay for individual marketplace plans, Corlette says. The federal government has an online calculator that indicates whether you fit into this bracket. That tax break can make it easier to find affordable, comprehensive coverage, Corlette says, and she recommends that people who already have 2019 ACA plans shop around the marketplace to make sure they get the best deal going into 2020. (How much plans charge can change each year.) People who bought coverage last fall and don't shop around will be automatically reenrolled in those health plans \u2014 which may not be the best for their needs and may be more expensive than other options. Also worth noting: Federal courts recently blocked a rule that would have penalized recent legal immigrants who use those subsidies. Known as the \"public charge\" rule, it would have counted that subsidy against people looking to stay longer in the United States. The court ruling means that, at least for now, legal immigrants should also be able to purchase subsidized health insurance with no penalty, Corlette says. \"If you have concerns or are worried, you should consult an immigration attorney. But assuming you are a legal resident, nothing has changed in terms of your entitlement,\" she says. Not everything that looks like an ACA plan actually is one Consumers should be wary of plans that look like they meet ACA standards but actually fall short. The Trump administration has loosened restrictions on non-ACA policies \u2014 \"short-term plans\" \u2014 so that they can last up to 12 months. (Previously they lasted only three months and were treated as bare-bones, stopgap insurance.) Pitched as a cheaper alternative to ACA coverage, they are allowed to factor in preexisting medical conditions \u2014 and can deny insurance to people because of their medical history. They also generally cover a much narrower range of benefits. Some have lifetime caps on benefits, and they typically don't cover prescription drugs. These plans are not eligible for federal subsidies. \"If you were to Google something like 'ACA plan' or 'Obamacare plan,' the first results will return insurances that are not ACA coverage,\" Corlette warned. \"A lot of it is going to be junky, skimpy coverage.\" One easy way to distinguish ACA-compliant plans from others: Make sure you're shopping through HealthCare.gov or an alternative set up by some states. Consumers who work with an insurance broker should be sure to communicate their desire to choose an ACA-compliant plan. Meanwhile, federal courts are weighing a legal challenge that could strike down the ACA It's not clear what would happen if that attempt to overturn the federal health law succeeds. But, for now, the case shouldn't affect your coverage decisions, all sides agree. A group of Republican attorneys general and governors filed a lawsuit in 2018 that argues that since the Supreme Court upheld the ACA in 2012 specifically because its individual mandate was deemed a valid exercise of Congress' taxing power, reducing that tax to zero \u2014 as Congress did \u2014 makes the entire law unconstitutional. It's an argument that many legal experts say is shaky, but a federal judge in Texas agreed with those who brought the suit. The case, known as Texas v. Azar, is awaiting a ruling from the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals. The Trump administration, meanwhile, has declined to defend the federal health law. A group of Democratic attorneys general has stepped in, in its stead. If the appellate court sides with the trial judge to overturn the ACA, the decision would likely be stayed and the case appealed to the Supreme Court. That could drag things out until next summer at the earliest. The administration hasn't indicated what it might do if the health law is struck down \u2014 a scenario that would gut the individual marketplace and eliminate the ACA's consumer protections. But most experts agree it is also not likely to affect the 2020 coverage year. Earlier this month, Joe Grogan, who heads the White House's Domestic Policy Council, reiterated that the administration \"will be prepared after that decision comes down\" \u2014 adding that \"nothing's going to happen immediately.\" \"This will surely go to the Supreme Court,\" Grogan said. \"It may or may not be decided \u2014 probably not decided \u2014 before the election.\" But it's unclear what a White House response would involve. Neither President Trump nor Republicans in Congress have put forth a health care proposal that would maintain the protections the Affordable Care Act put in place. That could be worrisome down the line, Keith and Corlette say. But any impact is far enough away that it shouldn't influence the way consumers choose health insurance for the next year. \"Nothing will change right away, and it shouldn't affect anybody anytime soon,\" Keith says. \"Go enroll. Pay your premiums.\" Emmarie Huetteman contributed to this report. Kaiser Health News is a nonprofit, editorially independent program of the Kaiser Family Foundation.

At the top of the photo is the date \u2014 Nov. 6, 2019 \u2014 when the young man was killed by Iraqi security forces during an anti-government protest. Abbas, who was 25, had fought for almost three years against ISIS with an Iran-backed Iraqi paramilitary group. His father, a retired Iraqi army corporal, says he never imagined that his son would die this way \u2014 one of more than 315 protesters killed in anti-government demonstrations since October. \"He was unemployed and there was no work for him.

Abbas went out every day for almost two weeks. His family, including the sisters who raised him after their mother died, barely saw him. And then, two weeks ago, his father received a phone call telling him a young man named Abbas, thought to be a doctor, had been killed. Abbas wasn't a doctor, but he'd had first aid training and was wearing a white lab coat. When he was shot dead near a bridge in central Baghdad, he'd been helping treat an injured protester. \"By God, my son did nothing wrong,\" says his father. \"He didn't steal anything. He helped save people and you killed him ... If you want to scare the protesters, take them to prison or shoot them in the leg or anywhere else. Don't kill them.\" Salih, 70, says he originally told Abbas not to go join the protests \u2014 that it was dangerous. But he eventually gave his blessing \u2014 even when Abbas came home with shrapnel wounds \u2014 because Iraq's revered Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani and other Shiite religious scholars supported the peaceful protests.

Salih's support for the religious scholars hasn't wavered. But he curses his country's prime minister and the security forces he is supposed to command. \"Any soldier takes orders from the commander,\" he says. \"Soldiers who didn't have orders to shoot wouldn't shoot that way.\" And he curses Iraq's parliament and the political parties that he says promise everything at elections and deliver nothing. A funeral banner praising Abbas as a martyr hangs in an alley leading to the Salihs' modest home in the mostly middle-class Shaab neighborhood, near Sadr City in Baghdad. There is little work \u2014 particularly for young people who don't have the money to bribe their way into a job. Abbas dropped out of school after seventh grade to help support his family. When ISIS invaded in 2014, he became a platoon leader and a paramedic with Kataib Hezbollah, one of Iraq's main Iran-backed militias. In the hospital where Salih's body was taken, his father kissed his son's head and his feet. The family buried him in the holy city of Najaf. A nurse at the hospital who saw Salih's body on the night he was killed tells NPR he had been shot in the chest with a rifle. One of Salih's sisters shows us a photo on her phone, taken in the hospital. It shows her brother lying dead, with wounds on his chest and neck. In a video taken by protesters, Salih lies lifeless on the road after being shot. He wears a white lab coat over a blue T-shirt covered in blood. Iraq's defense minister denies that Iraqi security forces are deliberately killing protesters. The country's military spokesman, Gen.

He is slumped against a concrete wall, temporarily deafened by a sound cannon used to disperse protesters. The medic, who says he left the Iraqi army to join the protesters, asked that his name not be used for fear of being arrested. Once he's recovered from the effects of the sound cannon, he shares his recollection of what happened on Nov. 6. \"We were treating a wounded protester,\" he says. \"I asked a major with the security forces to stop shooting so we could treat him and he said, 'OK, finish.' \" But another officer opened fire, he says, and shot Salih in the neck and the chest. He says he wishes he would have died instead. \"To be killed is a victory,\" he says. A physician, who also did not want to be identified for fear of arrest, says security forces are deliberately targeting medical volunteers helping the wounded. \"I was injured the first day of the protest because I was wearing a lab coat,\" he says. \"I took it off and threw it from the top of the bridge.\" In Iraq's oil-rich south, protesters have been demonstrating for almost two years against poverty, a lack of jobs, rampant corruption and Iranian influence. In October, these protests spread to Baghdad. An Iraqi government report last month said 149 people, most of them protesters, had been killed and thousands wounded in just two weeks of demonstrations. It said the government would investigate and punish those responsible. No one has been publicly brought to justice since. Protesters are demanding an entirely new political system. Many say they want to directly elect a president. At a bare minimum, they want the current government to fall. Prime Minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi promised to resign last month, but now appears to be planning to stay. Iraqi protesters hold spent tear gas canisters fired by security forces. Many of the protesters who have been killed were hit in the head by tear gas canisters that were fired directly at them. The protesters wear protective gloves to pick the canisters up and throw them back at security forces.\n                \n                    \n                    Jane Arraf/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Iraqi protesters hold spent tear gas canisters fired by security forces. Many of the protesters who have been killed were hit in the head by tear gas canisters that were fired directly at them. The protesters wear protective gloves to pick the canisters up and throw them back at security forces. In Tahrir Square, where the recent anti-government demonstrations started, protesters have turned the square into a mini-city with a library, wall art and free food. But on the streets leading to bridges that the protesters have been trying to retake from security forces, it looks like a war zone. Near Khilani Square, a few blocks away from Tahrir Square, the crack of live gunfire rings out as a crowd of young protesters pushes forward. The protesters run, some of them in bare feet, to hide behind buildings. Two well-dressed women, who have rushed out of their homes carrying white poodles, join the fleeing crowd. When the tear gas dissipates, the protesters surge forward again. The demonstrations are overwhelmingly peaceful, but with the rising number of deaths and injuries of protesters, that has begun to change. Two teenagers stand in an empty road near Khilani Square, readying glass bottles filled with gasoline to light and throw. \"It's for self-defense,\" one boy says. Another boy holds a slingshot. He says he plans to use it to hit security forces in the eye. Ambulances speed by, carrying wounded protesters. \"They are using real bullets and killing us,\" says an unemployed computer science graduate from the south of Iraq, volunteering at a medical station. \"They put masks on their faces so we don't know who they are, but now we know what they want. They want to kill us to stay in government so they can keep stealing.\" To try to suppress the protests, the government has been cutting off the Internet for days at a time. Away from the protests' front lines, young men pass around phones with gruesome videos showing those killed by bullets or tear gas canisters. All of the dead are considered martyrs. Most of the protesters, young and poor in an oil-rich country, feel they've gained nothing in the 16 years since Saddam Hussein was toppled. Now they feel they have nothing to lose.

The insult to Grand Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, spray painted without fear, would have been unimaginable before anti-government protests swept from Iraq's southern coast to its capital in the past month. Demonstrators accuse Iran and Iran-backed politicians of controlling Iraq and harming the country's interests. Iran has strong links to Iraqi security and intelligence forces, and even perceived insults have led to threats. Essa says he's not afraid. He has nothing to lose. He's a laborer but he has no work. And like most of the protesters, he blames their entrenched poverty on corrupt Iraqi politicians who put other countries' interests first. The protests, the biggest since 2003, have shaken the foundations of the Iraqi government. More than 250 protesters have been killed and thousands more wounded since the demonstrations began in early October, demanding jobs and better public services. Roads are blocked and schools shut down. Many Iraqis fear an even bigger confrontation could occur between protesters and government security forces that include Iran-backed former militia members. Prime Minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi, a year into his job, has promised to resign after a successor is named. Iraq's President Barham Salih has called for early elections after parliament passes a new election law. The reforms could potentially reduce the number of members of parliament, who are seen as raking in huge salaries, though many rarely show up for sessions. But the anger runs much deeper among protesters than a disdain for the Iraqi parliament. \"We came here prepared to die because after the fall of [Saddam Hussein's] regime, we haven't seen anything good,\" says Mahmoud, who came to a protest last week with a group of friends from a city north of Baghdad. \"Parliament is just mafias and corrupt parties \u2014 all of them came to destroy this country,\" he says referring to politicians who returned to govern Iraq when Saddam Hussein was toppled after the U.S.-led invasion in 2003. NPR is using protesters' first names because hundreds have been arrested and some kidnapped for participating in the past month's peaceful demonstrations. Yasser, an off-duty Iraqi army soldier who has joined the protests, lifts his pant leg to show a mass of scar tissue. Wounded in 2013, at the beginning of Iraq's battle against ISIS, he says he paid the cost of all his medical operations himself. Iraq is one of the biggest oil producers in the world. But tens of millions live in poverty. Across the country, failing public services and rampant corruption leave citizens paying bribes for everything from having paperwork processed at government ministries to getting a job. \"They have stolen everything from us \u2014 they have stolen even our dreams,\" says Baraq, a university student who has wrapped an Iraqi flag around his shoulders and holds a white plastic rose he says symbolizes the peaceful protest. The protests started with young men and then widened to include women and families, turning Tahrir Square into a flag-waving street party. But the demonstrators remain overwhelmingly male and overwhelmingly in their 20s or late teens \u2014 the first generation to have grown up with Internet and without Saddam Hussein. Previous protests in central Iraq were Sunni-led, railing against sectarian policies by the Shiite-led government. But in the current protests in Baghdad and the south, demonstrators are largely Shiite \u2014 and most reject sectarian divides, saying the important thing is that Iraq is governed by and for Iraqis. The protesters even include active-duty soldiers or fighters with Iran-backed paramilitaries. Some protesters are as young as in their mid-teens. \"At that age, you don't come from a past. There is no past,\" says Laith Kubba, an independent adviser to the government who was part of the opposition to Saddam Hussein, starting when he was a teenager. \"The only thing you have is the present and the future. ...

But at sunset, security forces come out and disperse everyone from both sides,\" says another protester, Akeel, looking down from the roof at the rows of demonstrators on the bridge and the three-wheeled tuk-tuks waiting to evacuate the wounded. Near the riverbank, a few young men collect stones to lob at riot police from slingshots made from rubber sandals. The protesters fear government forces will storm the concrete high-rise to dislodge them and are determined to keep control of it. Lines of young men ferry boxes of food up the narrow stairs. On the roof, medical volunteers bandage the arms and legs of protesters hit by shrapnel. The more seriously wounded are rushed from the bridge to ambulances waiting in the square. Ghazwan, a protester who spent a year-and-a-half as an unpaid member of an Iran-backed militia fighting ISIS, says he has been sleeping on the concrete floor for a week. \"If not for me, this is for my future sons. So they can get jobs,\" he says. \"There is no future here in Iraq.\" Another protester, with rosy cheeks that make him look as if he just came off a football field, is 15. \"I couldn't let the other guys come here and not do anything,\" he says. In an address delivered by his representative after last week's Friday prayers, Iraq's Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani \u2014 a reclusive and revered Shiite cleric \u2014 said he backed the peaceful protests. He directed the Iraqi government not to respond with weapons and troops. His directive is believed to be restraining security forces that are not totally under the control of the Iraqi prime minister. The protests are largely leaderless. But a leadership has begun emerging, advised by an older generation of human rights activists who have seen previous protests crushed by past Iraqi governments. \"I tell them they can't just sit around,\" says longtime activist Kamal Jabar, at the top of the high-rise occupied by protesters. \"I'm hoping we can mobilize this energy and turn this anger and this madness into a peaceful resolution to convince the international community to listen to them.\" To the young men eager to take on the security forces, his message is: \"I want to see you in a nice suit. Not in a coffin.\"",

For more, sign up for the Life Kit newsletter. If you've ever thought about running for office \u2014 your town council or school board, the state legislature, even Congress, this guide is for you. We'll tell you where to start and how to navigate everything from campaign fundraising to building a \"kitchen cabinet.\" What matters is that you care enough to run. That's according to former Massachusetts State Senator Marian Walsh, who wrote a book about how to win public office. She never lost an election throughout her three-decade political career. \"There will always be people in any arena who will know less and know more than you,\" Walsh says. \"The question is, do I care enough? And am I willing to do more of both. More caring and more learning.\" If you're running for local office, you're going to want to ask questions \u2014 to people who have run before, your supervisor of election, people who have done the job, even the person who currently holds the office. What was their day-to-day like? How big was their team? How much money did they raise? What did they do to campaign? Is the election a partisan race? Be a sponge. A number of organizations like Veterans Campaign, Run For Something, The Campaign Workshop and American Majority also run campaign bootcamps across the country for people to learn the basics of running for elected office, so that's an option if you want a place to ask questions and meet people who could be resources. You're running to win, but that doesn't mean you don't need to get everyone to vote for you. You just need more votes than your competitor. How many votes is that? Here's how to calculate it: Find the turnout numbers from the last few similar elections and average them. Then multiply that number by the number of registered voters in your jurisdiction. You'll want to aim for more than 50% of whatever that number is. Here's a worksheet, from the Conservative candidate training organization American Majority, you can use to calculate it. You'll also need to figure out how to get on the ballot. This varies by jurisdiction, but a good place to start is your state's secretary of state website or your own county elections website. From there, you should be able to download the forms you need and find the deadlines. Don't miss your deadlines! Your team should be a mix of people who know you well and people who know campaigns well. Every race is different, but you'll probably want to find someone to manage money, a communications director and a volunteer coordinator. And every team needs a campaign manager. After the big roles are filled, there are plenty of smaller tasks that need to be powered by humans: literature drops, phone calls, building and installing signs, knocking on doors, making food, etc. When people offer to help, give them a job. Marian printed postcards that allowed people to write their contact information, and just check a box of what job they wanted. NationBuilder has a template for a similar system online. From door-knocking to big gatherings, a five-minute conversation goes a long way. When people see your name on the ballot \u2014 you want them to know who you are and what you stand for. Your campaign should keep track of every interaction with someone who might be interested in helping you or voting for you. In larger districts, you won't be able to meet everyone. So focus on the people who are most likely to support you. \"You're not trying to get a shutout every single football game, you need to score more points than the opponent,\" says Matt Batzel, the National Executive Director of American Majority. \"So the goal is to win the election by getting more votes than your opponent.\" Go to your local elections office and request targeted info. It might cost money, but you should be able to get the party registration and addresses of registered voters in your district so you know where to campaign most efficiently. In a lot of cases, fundraising is the difference between a winning and a losing campaign. You might not think you need that much money, but think through your expenses \u2014 from a website domain to a campaign office to stamps \u2014 and set a goal for how much you need to raise. Then, ask. In general, people won't just offer you money, you're going to have to be the one to make the ask. But remember, you're not asking for money for yourself, you're asking for money to support change that you and the donor believe in. People often feel more connected to your campaign and motivated to help if they have a financial stake, even a small one. \"Campaigning is all about asking,\" says Bushra Amiwala, who serves on the Skokie School Board in Illinois. She is the youngest Muslim elected official in the U.S. \"Once I believed in myself and my ability to serve, it became very easy to ask someone else to do it too.\" Before you get started, remember to look up campaign finance laws for your state. How much you can raise? How much can an individual donate? How should you log your donations? This is really different depending on how your district votes. Whether it's in person on election day, or early, or by mail. The important thing is that you don't assume everyone you talked to is going to get out and vote for you \u2014 you have to ask them to.

As China celebrates the 70th anniversary of the Communist Party's rule, China's ambassador to the U.S. says that it's thanks to that very system that his country has climbed the ranks of global leadership. \"We have had our own setbacks over the years,\" Cui Tiankai tells NPR's Steve Inskeep. \"But generally speaking, as a whole, we have gradually found a path for China's development that works for China.\" \"China has grown into the second largest economy in the world from a very low base. We have lifted something between 700 million to 800 million people out of poverty,\" he adds. The celebration of the Communist Party's seven decades of power comes at a time when China is facing immense challenges both at home and abroad. The country recently recorded its slowest economic growth in nearly 30 years, which has been aggravated by a prolonged trade war with the United States. Meanwhile in Hong Kong, protests have endured for 17 weeks. Demonstrators who had been protesting a controversial extradition bill that has since been pulled are now calling for universal suffrage. Cui denies that Beijing influences the leaders available to the voters of Hong Kong to choose from \u2014 even though Beijing signs off on anyone who runs for elections in Hong Kong \u2014 but he says, \"No one should try to challenge China's sovereignty over Hong Kong.\" China also continues to contend with a U.S. military-bolstered Taiwan just off its shores and faces great criticism from the international community for its treatment of ethnic minorities, particularly the Uighurs and Hui \u2014 all while continuing to implement their lofty Belt and Road Initiative across the globe. Cui believes both the U.S. and China could make greater efforts to understand one another. \"Our strategic intention is very simple: We want our people to have a better life,\" he says. \"We are not here to challenge or try to replace any other country. We have no interest in global dominance or hegemony; we just want our people to have a better life.\" On China's domestic security apparatus I don't think that we are doing more in China than what you are doing in the United States. You have so powerful [sic] security agencies protecting Americans. We have to protect our Chinese people. I think that both are legitimate. Today's world is not that safe. We still have terrorism, you have so many shooting incidents here. So what is the responsibility of the government? On President Xi's move to do away with presidential term limits The change of the constitution just removed the term limit for the president. But actually for the leader of the party, the Party General Secretary of the party's Central Committee, there was no term limit. And this is just to coordinate the two because normally one person would take up both posts. So it's just a kind of coordination. It does not mean that we have in the constitution any life term [of the presidency] for anybody. On a resolution for the Hong Kong protests People in Hong Kong may have different views, they have to solve these problems themselves. But the bottom line is that nobody should challenge China's sovereignty, nobody should resort to violence.",

Personally, I like messages with my music. Some of my first experiences with music beyond the Top 40 format took place during the heat of the Vietnam War which became a high watermark for protest music in this country. It's how I discovered musicians like Bob Dylan and Joan Baez. Later on, the great voices of protest from Latin America became part of my playlist as songwriters began to speak out against poverty, inequality and racism. Victor Jara and Violeta Parra stirred my budding social justice consciousness. Marvin Gaye's epic What's Going On spoke to me in ways the others only hinted at. Over the last eight and half years, we have occasionally taken moments to listen and talk to musicians who have the courage to speak out and call attention to things they see as unjust. This week, we do it again with two musicians who face each other from either side of the U.S. David Barragan performs from his SoCal base as Olmeca, a reference to his indigena/Mexicano roots. He is a hip-hop artist, social activist and educator. Taina Asili is from the East Coast and from Afro-Caribbean heritage. She joins us to talk about her new album, Resiliencia. Listened to together, these two artists give us a glimpse into the world of musical activism. Lord knows there is plenty to sing about these days. Hear it all in the player.",

In the midst of a presidential budget proposal destined to generate controversy for its expected drastic spending cuts, White House senior adviser and first daughter Ivanka Trump wants to have a conversation about increasing the availability and affordability of child care. NPR has learned that the 2020 White House budget set to be released Monday will call for increased spending on child care and propose an initiative to address shortages. Presidential budgets are policy statements, frequently ignored by Congress, and this one is no different (It has already been declared a \"nonstarter\" by Democrats.) So in a way, this is Ivanka Trump and the White House signaling that they want in on a debate already underway in the business world and in politics about this \"ever growing challenge.\" \"You have care providers who are working at below poverty wages, you have parents who can't afford the care and you don't have a robust ecosystem of facilities because it's a low-margin business with high liability,\" said Ivanka Trump on the sidelines of a discussion she recently led at the White House with about more than a dozen people who specialize in child care. \"So, it's like just a fundamentally flawed system.\" NPR was invited to the West Wing listening session in late February and was given early details of the child care proposal from Ivanka Trump that is included in the president's 2020 budget. One-time investment The centerpiece is a proposed one-time investment of $1 billion to increase the supply of child care to underserved populations. States would apply for funding and could use it to encourage employers large and small to invest in child care or to support child care providers that operate during nontraditional work hours or that cater to parents who are enrolled in school. \"We want to encourage innovation,\" said Ivanka Trump. \"We want to encourage the private sector to step up.\" To get the money, states would have to \"establish targets for reducing unnecessary regulatory or other requirements that limit the supply or increase the cost of child care.\" A White House aide said this isn't meant to roll back regulations on child-to-caregiver ratios but rather to get rid of zoning requirements in some areas that don't allow child care centers in residential districts, for instance. It would be implemented through the Child Care and Development Block Grant program, which in the past two years saw its funding significantly boosted by Congress in spending bills ultimately signed by President Trump. A White House official, who declined to speak on the record because the budget is not yet public, said the president's 2020 budget proposal calls for spending $5.3 billion on the program, the same level that Congress set aside in 2019 and a big increase over what past Trump administration budgets asked for. The $1 billion one-time fund would come on top of that. Ivanka Trump said, \"Continuing to make sure we fund the programs adequately\" is key, while also talking up the increase in the child tax credit included in the Republican tax law passed in late 2017. Trump greeted the researchers, child care providers and representatives of business groups in the Roosevelt Room before going around the table asking about challenges and soliciting ideas for solutions. She chimed in occasionally to amplify someone's point or to ask questions. Here are some of the challenges that Trump and the experts she met with identified in that White House meeting: The early years are critical for brain development but quality, safe, affordable child care is often hard to come by. There are mile-long waiting lists for care that, for many families, costs more than their housing. And yet, a lot of child care workers can't make ends meet. As Trump talked about the challenges, she framed it in a way that Democrats have for years \u2014 not as a \"mom's problem\" or a \"families' problem\" but as an impediment to economic growth. Economic strain Chad Dunkley, CEO of New Horizon Academy, a child care provider, attended the listening session and has advocated for more child care funding on Capitol Hill. \"I think there's a growing bipartisan consensus that we have to do more to build the financial security of young families in this country,\" said Dunkley. \"They have to feel confident they can grow their families here, and if they don't, our economy is going to be in trouble.\" That economic strain is already evident in low birthrates and stalled labor force participation, Dunkley said. The White House was asked about proposed funding levels in the 2020 budget for Head Start, another major early childhood program, but that information was not forthcoming. President Trump included child care in his 2016 campaign, and as his re-election efforts ramp up, the White House has put a focus on selling the idea that he has kept his campaign promises. That said, this new proposal isn't remotely close to what Trump campaigned on. Campaign issue for Democrats It comes as child care is already a 2020 campaign issue, with Democratic candidates, including Elizabeth Warren, rolling out child care-for-all plans. \"How much you make at your job should not determine the quality of care your child gets. That's why for millions of families who need it, access to these child care options will be free,\" Warren said in a video announcing her plan. In Congress there are child care bills from Democrats in both the House and the Senate designed to stimulate growth in child care availability, defray costs for families that can't afford it and pay providers a living wage. The price tags on these plans run tens of billions of dollars each year, vastly more than the White House proposal. The White House official said these Democratic plans would cost \"unsustainable amounts of taxpayer dollars,\" adding that Ivanka Trump sees her role as \"an advocate for producing legislation that actually has a viable path forward.\" Asked if she could work with Ivanka Trump on child care, Sen. Patty Murray from Washington state, a leading Democrat on the issue, was polite. \"I'm excited that more people are aware of the barrier that child care is to working families in order to achieve their economic dreams and take care of their families,\" said Murray. \"So we welcome all ideas, but they have to be real ideas.\" There's plenty of agreement on the problems but not yet on the solutions. Asked which members of Congress the Trump administration had reached out to on the issue, the White House official said simply that Ivanka Trump looks forward to working with lawmakers from both sides of the aisle.",

Here, Guaid\u00f3 (center) speaks to a crowd of opposition supporters at Bol\u00edvar Square, in eastern Caracas, last Friday. Javier Corrales is a professor of political science at Amherst College and author of Fixing Democracy. Venezuela's authoritarian government is unraveling, and possibly undergoing regime transition. Outside forces are playing an important role \u2014 but in an unexpected fashion. Typically, foreign governments create conditions inside a country for a rupture with the status quo by providing moral, financial or even military support. But in Venezuela, since 2015, it has been the foreign policies of Venezuelans themselves that have triggered an international response, not the other way around. Here's how the crisis unfolded. In May 2018, socialist President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro declared himself the winner in an election that was unfree, unfair and fraudulent. On the day of his inauguration, Jan. 10, National Assembly President Juan Guaid\u00f3 refused to recognize Maduro's new term, calling him \"a usurper\" for arrogating the presidency without a democratic claim to it. On Jan. 23, Guaid\u00f3 went further by declaring himself interim president and calling for new elections. He did this by invoking the Venezuelan Constitution, which stipulates that in the absence of a legitimate president, power must go temporarily to the head of the country's legislature, the National Assembly. What is shocking is not so much that there are contested claims to the presidency \u2014 that happens often in regime transitions \u2014 but that the opposition managed to obtain such decisive support from so many quarters. Of the governments that have commented publicly, more than 50 countries have expressed support either for the National Assembly, for Guaid\u00f3 himself or for his central message of the need to call new elections, according to Prodavinci, a website for Venezuelan analysis. The Trump administration immediately recognized Guaid\u00f3 as interim president and has since ratcheted up pressure on what it now refers to as \"the illegitimate former Maduro regime.\" Meanwhile, Prodavinci counted only 15 nations \u2014 including Bolivia, China, Cuba, Iran, Russia and Turkey \u2014 that have expressed support for Maduro. Nearly the same number have said they won't take sides and instead are calling for dialogue to resolve the crisis. In terms of international opinion, the opposition is winning. Several years ago, the situation was the exact opposite. Despite receiving moral support from key lawmakers and thought leaders in the United States and other nations, the Venezuelan opposition was largely isolated internationally. How did this reversal in international backing occur? The answer lies with the foreign policies of both the government and the opposition. Maduro inherited from his predecessor, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez (in office from 1999 to 2013), one of the most interventionist foreign policies in Latin America's post-Cold War history. Much of the region's response to the Venezuelan crisis can be traced back to this interventionism. In the 2000s, Venezuela began to interfere in almost every Latin American country, supporting leftist radical groups, transferring nontransparent subsidies to friendly movements, openly insulting presidents who disagreed with Ch\u00e1vez and even supporting terrorists in Colombia. Many of these Venezuelan-supported allies, if they won power, repeated offenses similar to those of Ch\u00e1vez: concentration of power, high-level corruption, sectarianism, secret deals with the Chinese and mistreatment of the media. One of the consequences of Venezuela's interventionism has been Latin America's remarkable shift to the right since 2015. This shift has many explanations that cannot be reduced to a single story for all. But in almost every case, an important factor is a reaction to the bad behavior of the Venezuelan-supported left in each country. Latin American governments are not opposing Venezuela merely because they are on the right; instead, they are now on the right, and criticizing Venezuela, in response to what Venezuela did to their countries. Venezuela's polarizing interventionism did not end when it started to run out of petrodollars in 2014. In fact, it acquired even more objectionable dimensions. As oil revenues declined, Venezuela began to engage in more illicit financial operations, prompting major rifts with Panama and several European countries concerned about money laundering. As dissent in the armed forces grew, Venezuela intensified its support for narcoterrorism, which in Venezuela operates from within the military. Venezuela's support for drug trafficking is directly affecting crime rates in Central America, the Dominican Republic and Mexico. And as Colombia's government reached a peace deal with its largest rebel group, Venezuela began to support an alternative one, the National Liberation Army, which in mid-January took responsibility for a suicide bomb attack at a police academy in Bogot\u00e1 that killed at least 20 people. As if regional interference was not enough, Venezuela is now also exporting poverty. Because of the government's refusal to address the country's five-year-old economic crisis or even consider humanitarian aid, Venezuelans looking for food and medicine are leaving in droves, inundating the strained institutions of many recipient countries in South America. Venezuela's foreign policy has exported corruption, poverty and death across the Western Hemisphere. In sum, a costly legacy of the Chavistas \u2014 as the officials and followers loyal to former President Ch\u00e1vez are known, even after his death in 2013 \u2014 is that Venezuela's foreign policy has exported corruption, poverty and death across the Western Hemisphere. So today it is not surprising that so many Latin American countries are filled with anti-Chavista sentiment across the electorate. In supporting Guaid\u00f3, Latin American presidents are responding therefore not just to events in Venezuela but also to anti-Chavista sentiment in their own countries, itself the product of Venezuela's foreign policies. The United States is also responding to Venezuela's foreign policies. It is not clear that the Trump administration cares much about human rights in Venezuela. But it cares deeply about Venezuela's non-oil exports, especially drugs. The United States also dislikes the way that Venezuela treats Colombia, a key U.S. ally in the region. But it's not just the foreign policy of the government that has mattered in determining the international response. The foreign policy of the opposition has also been crucial. In 2006, the opposition had a terrible reputation across the globe. It was seen as composed of recalcitrant, obstructionist, elitist sore losers unwilling to accept the reality that they could not win elections against Chavismo. The opposition \u2014 a loose coalition of more than two dozen political parties on the left and right \u2014 then spent the next decade reconstructing its international image. That meant doing work at home and abroad. At home, the opposition became more democratic, meaning more eager to participate in elections, even if they were increasingly slanted. The opposition mobilized voters, growing electorally to the point of obtaining full control of the National Assembly in 2015, despite rigged electoral rules. Abroad, the opposition engaged in a systematic campaign to denounce Chavismo for all its faults, including human rights abuses. Members went to the right places \u2014 the Organization of American States in Washington, D.C., The Hague and European capitals. For Venezuela's May 2018 presidential election, many parties were banned, others boycotted, but the opposition succeeded in getting 47 countries to not recognize the vote. International activism has continued since. A recent Associated Press report provides nitty-gritty details of that activism. It was one thing to have international leaders refuse to recognize the election; it was another to get them to support Guaid\u00f3's assuming temporary powers. This was initially seen as too risky. So Guaid\u00f3 and his party bolstered their international efforts. This meant secret trips by members of Guaid\u00f3's party and other lawmakers across the border, personal visits with foreign presidents, discussions with both moderate and hard-line factions abroad and waiting until they garnered sufficient backing to initiate a transition. Guaid\u00f3 created the international response he wanted rather than responding to external cues. This is not to negate the importance of foreign influence in shaping developments inside Venezuela. Factors such as rising U.S. sanctions hurt the government and encourage the opposition. And now that the United States has fully sided with Guaid\u00f3, it may end up taking the driver's seat. But it was not internationally predetermined that Venezuela's opposition would gain the upper hand. It is a result of the Venezuelan government's own foreign policy blunders and the opposition's diplomatic achievements. Venezuela shows that local forces have the capacity to move foreign affairs. However weakened they may be, they are not just recipients of foreign influence but also shapers of foreign forces.",

            "article_content": "After weeks of its worst unrest in decades, Bolivia's embattled president fled the country for asylum in Mexico. All designated successors also quit and Congress now must decide on the next leader.  AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: Bolivia's former President Evo Morales arrived in Mexico today to live in exile. He resigned Sunday amid protests that began after serious flaws were found in last month's election. Now the senator next in the Bolivian line of succession has announced she will assume the presidency. NPR's Philip Reeves is in the capital city of La Paz. And before we begin, Philip, here's what we know. Morales resigned. His government collapsed. Anyone constitutionally designated to replace him stepped down. So what have you learned about this senator who's announced her intention to lead the country? PHILIP REEVES, BYLINE: She's called Jeanine Anez. She's 52. She's the second vice president. She's a lawyer with a media background, and she's a fierce critic of Morales. She had earlier announced that Bolivia's Congress was going to convene this afternoon to formally decide who would stand in as interim president. And here's the thing. Allies of Morales hold a majority in Congress, and they don't necessarily want her. A lot of them didn't show up today, so there was a problem forming a quorum. Yet despite this, she went ahead and took control of the Senate and assumed the mantle of interim president, saying she wants elections as soon as possible. Now, members of Morales' party, the Movement for Socialism, weren't there when she made that announcement. It's not clear to me at this point whether her move will stick or whether Congress will accept this, given the absence of a quorum. There's certainly been an angry reaction from Morales' supporters, some of whom tried to reach the Congress building after the announcement was made, and they were met by police and soldiers firing tear gas at them. CORNISH: You've underscored the challenges that she'll have with all of the Morales support still in Bolivia's Congress. What do we know about Bolivians more generally? REEVES: Well, this is a very unstable, volatile point in the history of this country. You just have to travel around this city to see that. A lot of roads are blocked off by makeshift barricades. The city is pretty much shut down. In the city today, there were very large numbers of police on the streets in full riot gear. The army is also on the streets. Those people who've been protesting for several weeks against Morales after the election that was held last month are celebrating because he's gone, but others are angry. Many of the people at the demonstration that was held today by supporters of Morales in the city are Indigenous Bolivians like Morales himself. They revere him because he did much to lift Indigenous people out of poverty during his 14 years, nearly, in power. But one particularly disturbing thing happened during that protest. Military jets flew very low and very fast over the crowd on multiple occasions while I was there. And this was evidently meant as a show of force, but it didn't seem to unsettle them. One of their chants was that, you know, we are not afraid. CORNISH: Given what you've described, even with this interim presidency, has the danger passed? REEVES: No, by no means. I mean, this is a very unstable situation. People here are worried about that. I spoke to one woman today who didn't - or doesn't align herself with Morales or with the opposition. She says she's no faith that civilian politicians can resolve this situation ultimately and settle on a leader that can really manage a peaceful transition to new elections. She says she's worried. She says she's afraid. And from the scenes today, I think she might be right to feel that way. CORNISH: That's NPR's Philip Reeves reporting from La Paz, Bolivia. Thank you. REEVES: Welcome.

            "article_content": "President Trump continued Monday to tweet criticisms of Baltimore and Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md. It's the latest in a series of racial controversies stoked by the president.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: President Trump launched another tweetstorm over the weekend, this time directed at Congressman Elijah Cummings, who is African-American. The president insulted Cummings' district. It's majority black, and it includes part of Baltimore. This is just Trump's latest attack against a non-white member of Congress. And critics say it is a political tactic of stoking divisions ahead of the 2020 elections. NPR's Ayesha Rascoe is following the issue and joins us from the White House. Hi, Ayesha. AYESHA RASCOE, BYLINE: Hello. SHAPIRO: OK. Just a couple weeks ago, of course, the president went after four members of Congress who are women of color and Democrats. Now he's going after Congressman Cummings, who is a Democrat leading multiple investigations into the Trump administration. Lots of people see a pattern here, singling out people of color for very personal attacks. What does the White House say about it? RASCOE: So the White House and Trump campaign say that this is not intentional, that the president is simply criticizing people that he doesn't agree with and race has nothing to do with it. Trump's acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, was pressed on this matter on \"Fox News Sunday.\" He had this exchange with host Chris Wallace. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"FOX NEWS SUNDAY\") CHRIS WALLACE: These are all six members of Congress who are people of color. MICK MULVANEY: I think you're spending way too much time reading between the lines. Does anybody... WALLACE: I'm not reading between the lines. I'm reading the lines. RASCOE: So Mulvaney says people are looking too deeply into this. But it's Trump's specific language about these lawmakers that's drawing fire. He described Baltimore in dramatic terms, basically as a place no human being would want to live - saying it was disgusting, rat- and rodent-infested mess. And about 600,000 people live in Baltimore. And poverty is not limited to that city. There are plenty of towns and cities in this country who struggle with poverty, including those that are - have voters who generally back President Trump. But we don't see Trump criticizing those places. SHAPIRO: Tell us about how the latest targets of these attacks are responding. RASCOE: So Reverend Al Sharpton went to Baltimore. He held a press conference. Ahead of that, Trump bashed him. He claimed that Sharpton hates whites and cops and called him a con man. Sharpton had a lot to say about that. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) AL SHARPTON: Calling me a troublemaker? Yes, I make trouble for bigots. I made trouble for him with Central Park. I made trouble with him for birtherism. I'm going to keep making trouble for bigots. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Preach. SHARPTON: As far as me being a con man, if he really thought I was a con man, he'd be nominating me for his Cabinet. (LAUGHTER) RASCOE: And Sharpton wasn't the only one firing back. The local newspaper, The Baltimore Sun, ran an editorial that said, better to have some vermin living in your neighborhood than to be one - referring to Trump. SHAPIRO: We should note that Central Park and birtherism were two other moments that Trump took a very public position against people of color, in one case President Barack Obama. President Trump insults a lot of his opponents, including politicians. Explain how these particular insults against people of color are different. How do they stand out? RASCOE: It's a particular tone that he's taken - and the targets. His language about people of color who criticize him often seems to include nods to stereotypes. These tropes - go back to your country, crime-infested areas - they have a long history in this - in America and a cruel history. I did a lot of reporting on this issue back last summer, cataloging hundreds of Trump's tweets. And what stood out to me going through those tweets is that Trump had praise for black celebrities and lawmakers who supported him. He would say they were smart or that they get it. But for those black people who opposed him, he would say they were dumb or low IQ and use this kind of specific language only on them. SHAPIRO: As you say, this kind of language has been a long for - has been around for a long time in America. What changes when it's the president of the United States using it? RASCOE: So I spoke to a Howard University professor Greg Carr. And what he said is that it's not really just the words from Trump - that we've had politicians who've done this before - but it's the silence from Republicans and others in power who defend these words that kind of contribute to this idea that black people will be permanent outsiders and that they will never be fully accepted by this country.

            "article_content": "British Prime Minister Boris Johnson hopes his Conservative Party can break through the opposition Labour Party's historic grip on England's working class. The election will be held on Thursday.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: President Trump won election in 2016 in part by breaching the blue wall. That's the way political strategists described blue states that Democrats thought he would never win, industrial states - Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania. On Thursday in the U.K., Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his Conservative Party hope to breach the red wall. That's the political strategist term for blue-collar regions in the north of England that have long been strong for Johnson's Labour Party opposition. NPR's Frank Langfitt reports from the red wall from a town called Bishop Auckland. (SOUNDBITE OF BLENDER WHIRRING) FRANK LANGFITT, BYLINE: Karen Walton (ph) is making a milkshake at her cafe. It's in a near deserted mall in this town of around 25,000, about five hours' drive north of London. Bishop Auckland is former coal country. Like most people here, Walton has always voted Labour. But this year feels different. KAREN WALTON: I'm still undecided, to be honest (laughter). LANGFITT: How are you leaning? WALTON: I'm kind of leaning more towards Conservatives purely to be out of Europe. LANGFITT: Did you ever think you'd say that? WALTON: No, I never thought I would say that - ever. LANGFITT: Why not? WALTON: I've grew up never to support Conservatives (laughter). LANGFITT: Labour has traditionally represented the working class of England's once industrial north. But people here also voted heavily for Brexit, which is why Walton thinks the Conservatives will win. WALTON: Votingwise in this town, I don't think it's going to be Labour anymore. This time round, I think it's going to be a shock (laughter). LANGFITT: Boris Johnson has pledged to, quote, \"get Brexit done.\" The prime minister may portray himself as a bumbling upper-class eccentric, but Walton says his Brexit message resonates here. WALTON: I think he's a crazy character. But when it comes to Briexit (ph), I do think he would get us out and get us a good deal. BRIAN RAMSEY: At the moment, the Conservatives are riding the wave only because the alternative is so appalling. LANGFITT: Brian Ramsey (ph) is sharing a pint with friends at a pub. He's talking about Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the opposition Labour Party. Corbyn has refused to take a side on Brexit. And some of his controversial past positions bother voters, like refusing specifically to denounce the Irish Republican Army and voting against renewing Trident, Britain's nuclear missile system. RAMSEY: Trident, nuclear, the IRA - all those things are enough for me to not be interested at all in giving him my vote. And I think a lot of people will be voting Tory and perhaps holding their noses while they do it. LANGFITT: Corbyn is deeply unpopular with the British public. The polling firm YouGov found that 61% viewed the Labour Party leader negatively. Boris Johnson has lots of detractors, as well... (SOUNDBITE OF METAL CLANGING) LANGFITT: ...Including Ken Crozier (ph), who's buying groceries this morning. KEN CROZIER: He's a liar. He's been sacked from two jobs for telling lies. And yet, you've got to put your trust in him. LANGFITT: The Conservative Party fired Johnson from a Cabinet job after he lied about an affair, and The Times of London fired him when he was a journalist for making up a quote. The Conservatives also have a bitter history in this part of the country. Under Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, the government shut down coal mines and crushed the miners' union. CROZIER: I mean, I'm an ex-miner. I had 12 months on strike because of a Tory government. When Margaret Thatcher died, the miners' union had a lot of party - you know, a ding-dong-the-witch-is-gone party. You know what I mean? LANGFITT: Many voters here are too young to remember the miners' strike, but Crozier will never forget. CROZIER: The Tory party has never done anything for working-class people - ever. I would sooner stick pins in my eyes and cut my arm off with a rusty spade than (ph) vote for Tory. LANGFITT: Still, Crozier worries the Tories will win on Thursday. People here are looking for hope. And, Crozier says, Johnson's promise of a bright economic future beyond Brexit appeals in an area that's never recovered from the loss of the mines. Frank Langfitt, NPR News, Bishop Auckland.

But, in his view, the future Massachusetts senator was \"absolutely anti-consumer\" on some positions at the time. Johnson, who commuted to work with Warren and her husband, Bruce Mann, for about six months in 1981, recalls one particularly wonky issue they would debate on their car rides: public utility accounting. Calvin Johnson, a University of Texas professor of corporate and business law, commuted to work with Elizabeth Warren and her husband Bruce Mann during his first semester of teaching at The University of Texas at Austin. Here, Johnson is photographed outside of Elizabeth Warren's home she rented in 1980's in northwest Austin on Wed., Oct. 09, 2019.\n                \n                    \n                    Katie Hayes Luke for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Calvin Johnson, a University of Texas professor of corporate and business law, commuted to work with Elizabeth Warren and her husband Bruce Mann during his first semester of teaching at The University of Texas at Austin. Here, Johnson is photographed outside of Elizabeth Warren's home she rented in 1980's in northwest Austin on Wed., Oct. 09, 2019. \"I was very strongly of the opinion that (the accounting methods were) giving excessive profits to the public utilities and, in fact, truly abusing the ratepayers,\" said Johnson, who has long considered himself a liberal Democrat. \"She came out very strongly in favor of business industry (and) the utilities.\" Through interviews with former colleagues and students, it's clear Warren arrived in Austin a moderate economic conservative, perhaps not an overtly political one, but a conservative nonetheless. She left far more ideologically confused. Perhaps more than any other time period in her life, the years Warren spent in Texas planted the seeds of her political identity. The message she espouses on the presidential campaign trail now about a shrinking middle class comes directly from the research she conducted on bankruptcy that began roughly 40 years ago in Texas. For years, Warren was a Republican; she registered to vote as a Democrat in Massachusetts in 1996, according to the Massachusetts elections commission. She told Politico in an interview earlier this year that she assumes 1996 was the first time she registered as a Democrat; but she doesn't recall voting for a GOP presidential nominee, with the exception of Gerald Ford in 1976. Warren's evolution was ideological before it was political. Some of her former colleagues in Austin recall Warren as a \"moderate\" but a moderate conservative \u2014 not driven by social issues, but by economic concerns. They found her smart and full of unlimited amounts of energy, but they also found some of her ideas peculiar. Tom McGarity recalls that his former law school colleague Elizabeth Warren was a believer of the libertarian-leaning Law and Economics movement in the 1980s.\n                \n                    \n                    Katie Hayes Luke for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Tom McGarity recalls that his former law school colleague Elizabeth Warren was a believer of the libertarian-leaning Law and Economics movement in the 1980s. \"I found Elizabeth to be, in some ways, off-putting,\" said Tom McGarity, a fellow University of Texas law professor, who describes himself as a longtime progressive. \"She was really into this 'law and economics movement' where we assume that everybody is a rationale economic actor, markets are the best way to go, and we should keep government out of business,\" he added. Law and economics was a movement popularized by the legal academic Henry Manne that swept through universities in the 1980s thanks to financial backing from conservatives. Supporters say the movement was a benign attempt to incorporate economics into the study of law. Critics say it was trying to proselytize professors. Either way, according to former colleagues, Warren was a believer. \"On the lookout for cheaters and deadbeats\" The early 1980s was also when Warren became increasingly interested in bankruptcy. In 1978, Congress had passed a new bankruptcy code. \"There was an enormous amount of contention over the new code,\" said Jay Westbrook, Warren's longtime research collaborator and co-author from the University of Texas. Creditors suggested that people were intentionally avoiding their debts. \"There was a lot of conjecture,\" said Catherine Nicholson, one of Warren's former research assistants. \"There was really no hard data on why people filed for bankruptcy.\" Warren wanted details. \"I might not have said so at the time, but I think I was on the lookout for cheaters and deadbeats as a way to explain who was filing for bankruptcy,\" she wrote in her memoir, A Fighting Chance. Kimberly Winick (left) and Catherine Nicholson, both law school graduates from the University of Texas, were research assistants on the multi-state bankruptcy project Warren conducted to find out who was filing for bankruptcy and why.\n                \n                    \n                    Photo Courtesy of Kimberly Winick\n                    \n                \nhide caption Kimberly Winick (left) and Catherine Nicholson, both law school graduates from the University of Texas, were research assistants on the multi-state bankruptcy project Warren conducted to find out who was filing for bankruptcy and why. Her attitude sounded Reagan-esque, but there was also a curiosity driving her. \"I wanted to believe that everyone who filed had done something terrible or stupid or had lazed about and never tried to make anything of themselves. I wanted to know that the work-hard-and-play-by-the-rules people might not get rich, but they didn't need to be afraid,\" she wrote. In essence, she wanted to believe that the people filing for bankruptcy were different from her or her family. So, Warren, along with Westbrook and Teresa Sullivan (who went on to become the president of the University of Virginia), conducted a massive multistate study called the Consumer Bankruptcy Project to figure out who was filing bankruptcy and why. They traveled across Texas and visited Pennsylvania and Illinois to sift through bankruptcy files. \"This is back when it was all paper,\" said Kimberly Winick, one of Warren's former research assistants. \"And we'd show up with a portable copying machine; it rolled like a rollerboard suitcase. And you get it there with reams of paper and start copying.\" The team was looking for answers to specific questions, such as: Was the debtor employed? What kinds of debt did they have? Had they run up massive credit card debt? Did they have medical bills? Had there been a recent divorce in the family? \"This was an empirical study\" said Winick. \"I mean that is how she works \u2014 ask a question that's a clean question and then get an answer.\" In addition to working for Warren, Winick took three classes with her. One trait she says she admires about her former professor was that Warren was \"always asking why\" and followed the evidence regardless of where it went. When the facts in their bankruptcy research became irrefutable, Winick says Warren was willing to reexamine her previous opinions. Winick doesn't remember discussing national politics with Warren. Westbrook agrees. \"We didn't talk in terms of partisan politics, we talked a lot about policy,\" he said. \"You have to remember that we were, and to a substantial extent are, academics. We're interested in thought, we're interested in concepts, and we're interested in facts.\" Still, Winick had a hunch her teacher had thought people filing bankruptcy were gaming the system. Their research ended up illustrating a different picture. \"The typical story [was] somebody who pushed a little too far or had bad luck,\" said Winick. Elizabeth Warren, seen here in an old edition of the University of Texas Law School yearbook, began bankruptcy research while in Texas that has influenced much of her academic and professional career.\n                \n                    \n                    Katie Hayes Luke for NPR \n                    \n                \nhide caption Elizabeth Warren, seen here in an old edition of the University of Texas Law School yearbook, began bankruptcy research while in Texas that has influenced much of her academic and professional career. A political conversion The Consumer Bankruptcy Project changed Warren. It wasn't theoretical academic work; it required looking into people's personal lives. \"She saw more of the very difficult side of life of the people who go through the bankruptcy process,\" said Westbrook. \"She saw their struggles. And she saw a variety of ways in which the credit industry manipulates things in order to get them ever deeper into debt.\" Westbrook says he can still recall specific anecdotes from individual bankruptcy files. \"These people were really in enormous amount of debt,\" he said. \"They had literally enough unsecured debt that it would take them years if they never bought another meal or paid a telephone bill to dig out from under.\" The end result of their research was unprecedented \u2014 an independent, data-driven analysis on bankruptcy that resulted in a book called As We Forgive Our Debtors. It drove much of the academic and professional work Warren has done since, though as The Washington Post pointed out, Warren and her co-authors faced skepticism and criticism from a rival about overexaggerating the claims. Still, Warren became known as an expert in the field and consulted corporate clients on bankruptcy. Recently her campaign released information showing that she made roughly $1.9 million from 1985 to 2009 through her corporate legal work. Some of that was for large corporations like Dow Chemical, but she also helped consumers in a class-action lawsuit against Sears over what her campaign describes as \"aggressive debt collection practices.\" Then, in the mid-1990s, Warren joined the National Bankruptcy Review Commission in what was perhaps the most political move of her career to date. \"Liz is the kind of person that, when she sees somebody doing something that she thinks really is gonna screw things up, she's not gonna be quiet about it,\" said Westbrook. And so, Warren started speaking up loudly in political circles about financial issues. \"It's just that none of it was in the context of being partisan,\" Westbrook said with a long pause, \"until it was.\" Warren's work on the bankruptcy commission made her more of a partisan \u2014 it became clear to her that Republicans in Congress were not her ally, nor were all of the Democrats. Old colleagues insist that all these years of studying bankruptcy changed Warren. It's why, they believe, she eventually registered as a Democrat in Massachusetts in 1996. Questions of authenticity Warren's bankruptcy research left a deep impression on her, but also on those who collaborated with her. \"I've known Elizabeth Warren forever. She cares about families and their struggles,\" said Nicholson, who worked as a research assistant for Warren for three years. \"Come next year, it'll be a hard choice for me in the ballot box,\" she added. It'll be a hard choice because Nicholson, who describes herself as a conservative Catholic, a Paul Ryan sort of Republican, voted for Donald Trump in 2016. \"However, I believe in Elizabeth Warren, too,\" Nicholson said recently at her home near Omaha, Neb. She still exchanges Christmas cards and emails with Warren. In the time since Nicholson first met her, Warren has evolved from one described as an economically conservative professor to arguably one of the fiercest liberal consumer advocates in the country. Some of Warren's progressive critics say this evolution raises questions about her authenticity. Some who've known her say this evolution is precisely what makes her authentic.",

Tim Ryan has ended his struggling bid for the Democratic presidential nomination after failing to qualify for the past two primary debates. \"I got into this race in April to really give voice to the forgotten people of our country. I look forward to continuing that fight,\" Ryan said Thursday in a tweet. The nine-term congressman becomes the seventh candidate to end his or her bid, now bringing the total Democrats in the field to 18. Ryan's centrist pitch to voters didn't resonate in a year where most of the electorate was clamoring for a more progressive candidate. The Democrat emphasized his Midwestern roots in a state President Trump had carried. And he took populist stands, arguing that the party needed to care more about blue-collar voters and the economic impact that trade and the loss of manufacturing jobs had on the region \u2013 a big part of why Trump won in 2016. Without modifying positions, Ryan believed Democrats would perform poorly in the Rust Belt states again, assuring Trump of a second term.

I look forward to continuing that fight.Thank you, to everyone who supported this campaign. pic.twitter.com/BT4z3fQ205 Ryan did qualify for both the June and July debates, where he allied with other moderates to attack more liberal candidates on their policies such as \"Medicare for All.\" However, he never hit more than 1% in a poll and didn't amass enough donors, either, to qualify for future debates. He raised only $426,000 in the third quarter. The congressman's exit is his second major failure at moving up the party leadership structure. After the 2016 elections, Ryan mounted an ultimately failed bid against Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi to become House minority leader, criticizing her for being too disconnected from working class Americans. Ryan was seeking to become the first House member to go straight from Congress to the White House since James Garfield.",

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is a self-described Democratic socialist who shares several policy priorities with the 78-year-old Sen. Bernie Sanders. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York is set to endorse Sen. Bernie Sanders for president at a Saturday rally in Queens, N.Y., the campaign confirmed to NPR's Scott Detrow. It will be Sanders' first campaign event since he had a heart attack earlier this month. Sanders teased the event during Tuesday's Democratic debate, saying there would be a \"special guest\" attending. Ocasio-Cortez rose to fame last year after upsetting House Democratic Caucus Chairman Joe Crowley in the primary. The 30-year-old Ocasio-Cortez is a self-described Democratic socialist who shares several policy priorities with the 78-year-old Sanders, including \"Medicare for All\" and the Green New Deal. She joins another member of \"the squad\" \u2014 as a quartet of first-term progressive women have come to be known on Capitol Hill \u2014 in backing Sanders. Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota announced Tuesday evening she is also endorsing the senator from Vermont. \"Bernie is leading a working class movement to defeat Donald Trump that transcends generation, ethnicity, and geography,\" Omar said in a statement. \"That is why he is fighting to cancel all student debt. That is why he is fighting to make all school meals universal. That is why he is fighting for a humane immigration policy that treats immigrants as human beings and not criminals. And it's why Bernie is fighting to end our forever wars and truly prioritize human rights in our foreign policy \u2014 no matter who violates them. And it's why I believe Bernie Sanders is the best candidate to take on Donald Trump in 2020.\" Ocasio-Cortez and Omar \u2014 along with Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib and Massachusetts Rep. Ayanna Pressley \u2014 have attracted attention since they arrived in Washington, both for their progressive stances and their historic elections. And they've also become targets of President Trump. This summer, Trump derided them on Twitter, suggesting they were anti-American and should \"go back\" to the \"crime infested places from which they came.\" All four women of color are American citizens, and all but Omar were born in the U.S. The congresswomen, who are popular with the party's liberal base, could provide a needed boost for Sanders. He's been passed in the polls by Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who also has an influential progressive following. And after he had a heart attack two weeks ago, which resulted in two stents being inserted to address a blocked artery, there are new questions about his viability for office given both his health and age. At Tuesday's debate, Sanders dismissed questions about his health, saying: \"We are going to be mounting a vigorous campaign all over this country.\"",

            "article_content": "It's election season in Poland, and the clear favorite is the right-wing Law and Justice party. It has overseen one of the fastest growing economies in the EU.  RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: It's election season in Poland and there's a clear favorite. At a time when neighboring economies are slowing, the ruling Law and Justice Party has overseen one of the fastest growing economies in Europe. It's also one of the continent's most conservative parties with a nationalist message that's gaining traction. Here's NPR's Rob Schmitz. (SOUNDBITE OF BELLS) ROB SCHMITZ, BYLINE: To understand the politics of Poland, this is a good place to start. UNIDENTIFIED SINGERS: (Singing in Polish). SCHMITZ: Thursday night mass at the Immaculate Conception Church, the heart of rural Gora Kalwaria, an hour outside of Warsaw. Eighty-year-old Kazimiera Sokolowska (ph) prays there three or four times a week. KAZIMIERA SOKOLOWSKA: (Through interpreter) Being Polish means God, children and family. SCHMITZ: She thanks the ruling party, Law and Justice, for sharing her church's values. SOKOLOWSKA: (Through interpreter) I think it's good we have a government that represents our religious convictions and that's also concerned for the common man. UNIDENTIFIED SINGERS: (Singing in Polish). SCHMITZ: The Law and Justice Party was founded by former Prime Minister Jaroslaw Kaczynski and his identical twin brother, the late Polish President Lech Kaczynski - both were pro-democracy leaders decades ago under communist rule. The party won Poland's last parliamentary elections in 2015 with an outright majority, a feat no party has done since the fall of communism. The party's message - that people have not benefited enough from the country's post-communist economic liberalization and integration into the European Union - appealed to Poland's working class. And in a country where 9 of every 10 citizens are Catholic - a third of them who regularly attend church - what the party calls its pro-family social agenda is popular, too. ANDRZEJ JEROMINEK: (Through interpreter) Because those are the values tested over many centuries, and because those are values that not only lead to God but also integrate families. SCHMITZ: Andrzej Jerominek is a parish priest in Gora Kalwaria. He says his parish supports the Law and Justice Party's subsidies for parents who have more than two children, and he backs the party's opposition to gay marriage. JEROMINEK: (Through interpreter) That ideology is dressed in the feathers of humanistic values, but underneath lies harm for human beings. It has the goal of transforming young minds so that they believe the most important element of being human is the sexual dimension. The government is protecting us against that. SCHMITZ: And the support that priests lend to the Law and Justice Party is powerful. JACEK KUCHARCZYK: The political impact of the church is rather limited in big cities. In small areas, they are all-powerful. Basically, they shape politics as they like. SCHMITZ: Jacek Kucharczyk is president of the Institute of Public Affairs, one of Poland's largest think tanks. He says priests throughout rural Poland encourage parishioners to vote for the Law and Justice Party. In return, Kucharczyk says, the party protects the church. KUCHARCZYK: As long as we are in power, you have nothing to be afraid. There won't be investigations into pedophilia. There won't be any changes in your privileged position in public institutions such as public schools and so on and so forth. SCHMITZ: On the streets of Warsaw, Poland's capital, many people NPR interview agree the relationship between the church and Law and Justice keeps both of them in power. But many, like retired resident Blanka Radomska (ph), are frustrated with other aspects of the party's rule, especially the party's move to grant lawmakers more power over the appointment of judges, threatening their independence. BLANKA RADOMSKA: (Through interpreter) I don't approve of what's been done to the judiciary. I don't approve of the gall, the arrogance in every area. I'm afraid that if it continues this way, they'll get their hands on the media, too. SCHMITZ: In fact, in a 232-page party manifesto published in preparation for the October 13 election, Law and Justice outlined new regulations for Polish journalists that rights advocates called an assault on democracy. The Institute of Public Affairs' Jacek Kucharczyk says a strong economy has helped Law and Justice stay in power, and the party's nationalist populist message has appealed to other Eastern European countries. But he says for Law and Justice, the upcoming election poses an existential threat. KUCHARCZYK: These people have done so many things during the four years in power that they will likely face legal actions if they lose power, so it's make or break for them. I mean, they have everything to lose. SCHMITZ: But losing doesn't seem likely. Law and Justice leads its opposition by almost 20 points in opinion polls ahead of Poland's October 13 election.

            "article_content": "Israelis head to the polls for the second time in six months after the country's longest-serving prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, failed to build a majority in parliament.  NOEL KING, HOST: Many Israelis are at the polls today even though Israel had an election less than six months ago. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu won the vote in April, but he could not form a governing coalition at the time, so he pushed for this redo. He's now the longest serving prime minister that Israel has ever had, but he is also politically weaker than he's ever been. NPR's Daniel Estrin is in the town of Bat Yam, which is south of Tel Aviv. Hi, Daniel. DANIEL ESTRIN, BYLINE: Good morning. KING: So you're outside of a polling station. What's it like there? ESTRIN: Well, I'm seeing more police presence here than the last election. This election season's been very tense. Netanyahu has warned of voter fraud by Palestinian Arab voters. But where I am is a working-class town with many Russian-speaking voters - Russian-speaking immigrants. They usually vote for a candidate, Avigdor Lieberman, himself a Russian-speaking immigrant. But Netanyahu's been trying to attract them to his camp, and it seems to be working. From where I am, I'm seeing a lot of voters walking home with flyers and free calendars for the Jewish New Year, and they're in Russian and with Netanyahu's face on them. KING: Oh, that's really interesting. So when you've been talking to voters today, are you getting the sense that some of them are changing their minds or moving into Netanyahu's camp? ESTRIN: The thing is, voters say they're going to be staying with the candidates that they voted for the last time - although, this newest election season has been pretty vicious with candidates kind of attacking minority groups. And a lot of people here that we spoke with at the polls say that they are really sick of this kind of discourse - kind of picking at Israel's scabs and the divisions in society. Take a listen to one of the voters we met, Hadar Droripas (ph). HADAR DRORIPAS: I'm sick of the fake news of the government and the press that we are not united, that we fight each other all the times. And it's not true. ESTRIN: And another voter named Yossi (ph) also echoed that sentiment. Take a listen to him. YOSSI: Israel needs to heal. I have children. You know? I educate them to love everybody, to respect everybody - doesn't care if he's religion or if he's non-religion, if he's Arab, etc. There is a lot of hate. ESTRIN: He says he's voting for Netanyahu's centrist opponent, Benny Gantz, even though he's pessimistic. He doesn't think he's going to win, and he thinks Netanyahu will continue to stay in power. KING: Yeah, he sounds mostly optimistic, actually. Let me ask you, Daniel, if voters are not changing their minds and Benjamin Netanyahu wants a different result, is there anything that could actually change the result this time around? ESTRIN: Well, one thing people are looking at very closely is the voter turnout in the Palestinian Arab community. They had a very low voter turnout last time, but there are efforts to get them to the polls. And if their community votes in larger numbers, that could tip the scales away from Netanyahu. And we've seen in this campaign that Netanyahu's party and Netanyahu himself have been singling out Palestinian Arab voters and talking about possible Arab voter fraud. And so there's been a lot of focus on that community, which could help swing this election. KING: Just quickly, Daniel, is there anyone running who could beat Netanyahu? ESTRIN: If anyone could, it would be Benny Gantz. He's the centrist candidate, a former military chief of staff. But honestly, Noel, he doesn't have a very clear path to victory, and we could see deadlock like we saw last time. KING: Not great for Netanyahu. NPR's Daniel Estrin in the town of Bat Yam south of Tel Aviv. Thanks, Daniel. ESTRIN: You're welcome. Copyright \u00a9 2019 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "Campaigns in Israel make their closing arguments as elections approach Tuesday. It's the second vote in less than six months. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is fighting for political survival.  LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST: Benjamin Netanyahu is Israel's longest-serving prime minister, but now he's facing a tough battle for political survival. He narrowly won elections last spring but failed to form a government. So he pushed for repeat elections, which take place on Tuesday. NPR's Daniel Estrin is in Jerusalem, and he joins us now. Good morning. DANIEL ESTRIN, BYLINE: Hi, Lulu. GARCIA-NAVARRO: So why did Netanyahu fail in the last elections? Remind us. ESTRIN: Well, what happened was that some of his former allies turned against him. First of all, his former military chief of staff Benny Gantz joined the race, and he became Netanyahu's main opponent. Then what happened was that Netanyahu won the elections, but then another former ally of his turned against him - Avigdor Lieberman. He's a right-wing politician, and he refused to join Netanyahu's coalition. So Netanyahu was left without a majority. And what he did was something that hasn't been done before in Israel - he pushed for new elections. GARCIA-NAVARRO: But do they have an actual chance of beating him and becoming prime minister? ESTRIN: Well, if anyone can replace Netanyahu, it would be Benny Gantz. He right now is neck and neck with Netanyahu in the race. He's this tall, good-looking, popular figure. He's a centrist. He's trying to run as a unifying figure for the country as an alternative to Netanyahu's divisive style. But he honestly doesn't really have a clear path to forming a government and even says he's willing to ally with Netanyahu's party. There's this other politician I mentioned, Avigdor Lieberman. He's been gaining in popularity because he has tapped into public resentment against Netanyahu's alliances with religious parties. He will not be prime minister, but he will get enough votes, probably, to tip the scales and determine who will. So we have to see whether this time around he'll be willing to help Netanyahu keep his seat. The thing is that the polls show that we could see very similar results as the last election. And that could mean a stalemate and maybe even third elections. GARCIA-NAVARRO: What kind of campaign is Bibi Netanyahu running to try and win a clear victory this time? ESTRIN: Well, he's poking at those divisions that you mentioned. His tactic is to energize his working-class right-wing base to actually show up at the polls. And so he is warning of terror attacks if he's not elected. He's warning that Palestinian-Arab politicians will come to power if he's not elected. He's even promising to annex land in the West Bank, which would be a very controversial move. And he's also trying to play up his status as this world statesman. So he met Vladimir Putin last week. You go around Israel, and you see these big posters of Netanyahu posing with Putin and with Trump. GARCIA-NAVARRO: President Trump is, of course, a close ally to Netanyahu. Is the president playing a role in the Israeli elections? Is he trying to help Netanyahu win? ESTRIN: Well, in the last election campaign, Trump did give Netanyahu a very clear boost. He hosted Netanyahu at the White House. He recognized Israel's annexation of the Golan Heights. But this time around, Lulu, it's been very interesting because the Trump effect hasn't been as effective. Yesterday, Trump tweeted that he's discussing a mutual defense pact between the U.S. and Israel. And Netanyahu will want voters to look at that and say, wow, look at what Netanyahu can do with his close ties to Trump. But honestly, what's been dominating headlines here is a lot more like Trump's willingness to meet with Iran's leadership and the departure of John Bolton, the national security adviser who was very close to Netanyahu. These things are kind of coming at just the wrong time for Netanyahu as he runs for re-election. It suddenly doesn't look as though Netanyahu has Trump in his pocket. GARCIA-NAVARRO: That was NPR's Daniel Estrin in Jerusalem. Thank you very much. ESTRIN: You're welcome. Copyright \u00a9 2019 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Democrats running for president next year have worked hard to differentiate themselves from President Trump on issues such as immigration, tax cuts and health care. When it comes to trade, that hasn't been so easy. Trump, after all, came to office as a fierce critic of U.S. trade policy, arguing that previous administrations had been duped into signing free trade agreements that had cost Americans millions of manufacturing jobs. \"I pledge to never sign any trade agreement that hurts our workers or that diminishes our freedom and independence,\" he said to enthusiastic applause in his nomination speech at the 2016 Republican National Convention. At times, Trump's rhetoric on trade has sounded pretty much indistinguishable from that of the most liberal Democrats. And since taking office Trump has veered sharply away from traditional Republican policy on trade, through a series of tariffs and trade wars that have upended relations with the most important U.S. trading partners. \"It's like Donald Trump has co-opted Democratic trade policy,\" says Dan Ikenson, director of the trade policy center at the libertarian Cato Institute. Democrats have long been seen as the party of the working class and labor unions, and many shared a strong skepticism about trade agreements. President Bill Clinton signed NAFTA into law, but he did so over the opposition of most of his fellow Democrats in Congress. By the time President Barack Obama spearheaded the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a massive trade pact involving a dozen Pacific Rim nations, opposition to trade agreements had only hardened among both Democrats and many Republicans. After years of watching U.S. manufacturing jobs flee overseas, American voters who were once open to free trade increasingly see it as it harmful to American interests, says Elaine Kamarck, a former aide to Clinton. \"Even before Trump there was the beginning of a sort of left-right consensus that we needed to do something about trade and particularly something about China,\" says Kamarck, now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. That has left Democratic politicians who once backed agreements like NAFTA in something of a bind. They have responded by trying to thread the needle, arguing that trade is still beneficial, as long as it's done fairly. In 2016, Obama's secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, went from supporting the Trans-Pacific Partnership to arguing that it needed to be renegotiated \u2014 a position now shared by current front-runner and former Vice President Joe Biden. \"The Democrats that are running for president are largely reflecting where Democrats in Congress have been for decades, and the Democratic base,\" says Lori Wallach, director of Public Citizen's Global Trade Watch. \"Candidates like Biden ... who have been great defenders of the failed status quo and promoters of it \u2014 and may still on policy grounds believe in it \u2014 recognize that politically they just can't be there anymore,\" she adds. Other Democratic candidates have sought to outflank Trump with even harsher opposition to trade policy. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren argues that Trump's revised NAFTA agreement with Mexico and Canada didn't go far enough. She has proposed a much stricter set of regulations that would essentially bar the U.S. from trading with countries that fail to uphold labor and environmental standards. Trade pacts like NAFTA are written by multinational corporations for their own benefit, Warren said at a CNN debate in July. \"They have no loyalty to America. They have no patriotism. If they can save a nickel by moving a job to Mexico, they'll do it in a heartbeat,\" she said. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who has long been a fierce critic of U.S. trade policy, agreed. \"If anybody here thinks that corporate America gives one damn about the average American worker, you're mistaken,\" he said. Other Democrats have criticized Trump's tactics, if not his goals. By imposing or just threatening tariffs against traditional U.S. allies such as Canada, Europe and Japan, Trump has undercut his own negotiating position and made it harder to take on the real bad actor, China, several candidates have said. Tariffs \"are a huge mistake,\" former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke said at the CNN debate. \"They constitute the largest tax increase on the American consumer, hitting the middle class and the working poor especially hard, and farmers in Iowa and across the country are bearing the brunt of the consequences.\" The chaotic nature of Trump's trade agenda gives Democrats an opening to argue that despite his harsh rhetoric, he hasn't really delivered on trade, Kamarck says. There's still no trade agreement with China, and the new NAFTA hasn't made it through Congress yet. \"He's been on and off and around and up and down and nobody knows where the negotiations stand and he says things that aren't true, and so I think on trade this will come down to a matter of the president's competence,\" Kamarck says. To Ikenson, of the pro-trade Cato Institute, the tenor of the current debate leaves a lot to be desired. As Trump fights with China and Democrats ramp up their own rhetoric, no one is left to argue for the economic benefits of trade. \"What happened to the abandoned center?\" Ikenson asks. \"That seems to me to be a place where a lot of good things can happen.\"",

The event featured appearances by 21 Democratic presidential candidates seeking voters in the early primary state. Former Vice President Joe Biden weathered a weekend of stinging criticism from his Democratic rivals following his comment about his ability to work with segregationists to get things done in the Senate, but it appears to have had little impact on how voters here in South Carolina see him. Bill collector Brenda Wright isn't supporting Biden for the nomination for an entirely different reason. \"If you're 76, it's time to go home and sit down. I'm 60, and I'm ready to go home and sit down,\" she joked. Wright said she wants to learn more about California Sen. Kamala Harris, South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg and former Texas congressman Beto O'Rourke. If anything, the crowded candidate field is a bit much for her. People walk down the sidewalk outside of Jim Clyburn's World-Famous Fish Fry.

For example, retiree Wanda Hampton said Biden has her support, but she was open to switching her vote. \"For the last eight years, he was the vice president, got to know him a whole lot, you know?\" she said. \"But, I'm still learning stuff.\" Another retiree Dianne Barnes is leaning toward Massachusetts Sen.

Unlike Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada \u2014 the other three early states \u2014 in South Carolina's Democratic primary, a majority of votes will be cast by African Americans. In 2016, black voters made up 61% of the primary electorate. \"The party in general needs to acknowledge black women, but just black people in general,\" Barnes said. \"They're always talking about the 'white working class.' Well, you know, there's a black working class that's struggling just as much as the white working class.\" The 2020 presidential field, which includes three black candidates of the two dozen currently running, is the most racially progressive ever. Proposals for reparations and racial justice are part of nearly all the candidates' platforms. However, black women interviewed by NPR said they were motivated more by universal economic concerns \u2014 how to get ahead in the world \u2014 and by one singular goal, said former college professor Tricia Motes.

They also share a bond through their sorority, Alpha Kappa Alpha. \"She's my sister, so what can I do, right?\" Motes said. The toughest primary votes to win might be those of younger voters like Briana Hughey. She's 25, progressive and dissatisfied. \"I'm not a particular fan of anybody right now,\" she said.

It's largely true that black women are the most consistent Democratic voters of any bloc of the electorate, but turnout among black women can be make-or-break for Democrats. It was in 2016, when decreased black turnout contributed to Hillary Clinton's defeat. \"Clinton felt like she already won,\" Hughey said. \"She knew that the way polls were going, she was estimated to win, and she didn't, and that hubris kind of kicked her in her own butt.\" What every single Democratic candidate has to their advantage is every woman interviewed said they would vote for whoever the nominee is, no matter what. Educator Deirdre Niblock, said there is not a single thing that could stop her from voting in 2020. \"Not one,\" Niblock said. \"If I got to run to the polls, jump over a fence, it won't matter.\"",

Tim Ryan is the latest Democrat to join the growing field seeking the 2020 presidential nomination. Ryan announced his intentions on ABC's The View on Thursday, telling the panel that he is running to be a champion for manufacturing in a country that has been fractured by trade and outsourcing. \"I understand that legacy of job loss. ... I understand where we need to go. The country's so divided right now that we can't get a plan together. The first thing we ought to do is unify,\" Ryan said.

Ryan criticized Trump's record and approach, saying the president wants to go back to an \"old economy\" and save it instead of looking toward emerging technologies such as wind and other alternative energies. \"Trump has been full of promises and hasn't delivered on anything,\" Ryan said. \"He's forgotten us.\" Ryan is a more moderate lawmaker who represents blue-collar areas of Youngstown and other parts of Ohio that flipped from voting for Barack Obama to Trump. His populist politics have aligned with the president on issues like manufacturing and trade, and he is opposed to NAFTA. That could help him stand out in a primary that features many progressives, since many Democrats worry about the need to win back Rust Belt areas in 2020 to defeat Trump. The 45-year-old is best known for his unsuccessful challenge against Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., to lead House Democrats as minority leader after the 2016 election. Ryan criticized Pelosi and the Democratic Party overall for being too disconnected from the working class. \"You know, we need to get jobs. And we need to get them in areas like mine in Youngstown, Ohio, down in coal country,\" Ryan told NPR's Steve Inskeep during a 2016 interview. \"You know, these people are human beings. They're American citizens. They work hard. They play by the rules. And their voice needs to be heard. And I think we need to reach out to them. And if we're going to get into the majority as Democrats, we need those people to leave Trump and come to the Democrats.\" Ryan ended up with about a third of the support of the caucus in that 2016 leadership race. He again sought to challenge Pelosi in 2018 after Democrats won back the House, but ultimately struck a deal to support her. Ryan has a far lower national profile than other Democrats already running, and no House member has successfully gone directly from Congress to the White House since James Garfield. He is not the only one trying, though \u2014 former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke, Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard and former Maryland Rep. John Delaney are already running. California Rep. Eric Swalwell and Massachusetts Rep. Seth Moulton are still weighing bids.",

Allegations of inappropriate contact with women are putting Biden's potential campaign hopes in jeopardy. Welcome to the nightmare of being the front-runner for the Democratic nomination for president, Joe. Two women have complained about being touched inappropriately by former Vice President Joe Biden, who has been the leading (if still undeclared) candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020. Biden's poll numbers, while far from overwhelming, have still been the best of the ever-widening Democratic field. So any story that even hints at a Biden scandal is going to lead the newscast and leap to the front page. These two women's allegations, by themselves, are unlikely to determine the trajectory of Biden's candidacy. Even the viral video clips of his shoulder-rubbing \"Uncle Joe\" routine will not be the last word. But all the above constitute a serious concern for Biden and his backers, because they highlight a fundamental vulnerability that will burden him if he makes another bid for the Oval Office. On the most obvious level, complaints of this kind renew the criticism of Biden's past performance on issues affecting women and people of color, the two constituencies likely to matter most in choosing the next Democratic nominee. But on a deeper level, these stories reinforce a perception of the 76-year-old Biden as an only partially reconstructed man of the last century \u2014 an embodiment of the attitudes of an earlier era. His basic vulnerability is being cast as a candidate of the past in a party selling itself as the party of the future. Biden has already apologized for his handling of the Anita Hill hearings in 1991, when Hill described being sexually harassed by Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas. Biden was chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee and failed to give her, in his own words, \"the hearing she deserved.\" Although Biden ultimately voted against Thomas, he and the rest of the all-male panel in the hearings often gave the impression that it was Hill who was on trial. Years ago, Biden also expressed regret at positions he took in the early years of his career in Delaware and in the Senate, when he opposed, among other things, busing to achieve racial integration in schools. More recently, he has regretted in public his support for the 1994 crime bill that has been widely seen as prejudicial against African-Americans. Such contrition may help Biden mend some fences. But adjusting his aura of attachment to the past is a trickier proposition. Because perceptions of Biden as \"old school\" or \"old fashioned\" are not just liabilities to be shed \u2014 they are also the basis of his appeal to many older, white, working-class Democrats and independents. No one should forget that the failure to connect with many of these voters drove Hillary Clinton's share of the overall white vote down to 37 percent and cost her the election. No one expects Biden to win back a majority of the white vote for his party. But getting back above 40 percent would put him with 2008 Barack Obama and 1990s Bill Clinton and probably put him in the White House. Biden is a product of Irish Catholic immigrants in Scranton, Pa. His natural appeal in Pennsylvania and other Great Lakes states Clinton narrowly lost in 2016 is a major part of his case for being the party's best shot against President Trump. It must be said that the complaints from these two women describe brief incidents that took place in public, one in 2014 and one in 2009. They are offenses that many in Biden's generation would regard as minor. One of his recent accusers has said he smelled her hair and kissed the top of her head. The other says he put her hands around her neck, turned her head and rubbed noses with her. \"It wasn't sexual, but he did grab me by the head,\" Amy Lappos told The Hartford Courant on Monday. Lappos, at the time, was an aide to Connecticut Rep. Jim Himes. \"He put his hand around my neck and pulled me in to rub noses with me. When he was pulling me in, I thought he was going to kiss me on the mouth.\" Perhaps we should be shocked that no one has expressed shock at these accounts previously. Biden is a prime example of what Jerry Seinfeld has called \"a close talker,\" one who brings his face uncomfortably near even at the moment of introduction. Beyond that, he has long been known for being overly familiar and physically exuberant toward women he has just met, women of all ages. In 2014, NPR's Tamara Keith reported on Biden leaning in to plant a kiss on a woman who turns out to be 101 years old. Beyond that, he is inclined to rub a woman's shoulders or hold her hand or get close to her face. Both of the recent accusers seemed to suggest his behavior was weird more than frightening, embarrassing more than threatening. Given the litany of male offenses brought to light in the past two years by the #MeToo movement, these incidents may seem relatively harmless. But House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic Party's highest-ranking woman, said Tuesday morning that while the allegations against Biden are not \"disqualifying,\" he needs to join the \"straight-arm club\" and change his behavior. \"He has to understand in the world that we're in now that people's space is important to them,\" Pelosi said at a panel event sponsored by Politico, \"and what's important is how they receive it and not necessarily how you intended it.\" And she said his apology was not enough. \"To say, 'I'm sorry you were offended,' is not an apology,\" Pelosi said. \"It's, 'I'm sorry I invaded your space,' not, 'I'm sorry you were offended.' \" Others, including women who have met or known Biden for years, would say they reveal more about personality than character \u2014 more about style than fitness for office. A widely quoted op-ed in USA Today by former Biden aide Elizabeth E. Alexander offered a spirited defense: \"He was, is and always has been a champion for women and equality.\" Some will also wonder why Biden, at 76, seems more a target here than Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who has had to deal with allegations of sexual harassment by staffers within his 2016 campaign. Sanders is, after all, even older than Biden and at least as much a product of an earlier time. But Sanders, the outsider candidate who calls himself a democratic socialist, was not accused of inappropriate contact himself, and he also found in 2016 a connection to the outsider voters of his adopted Democratic Party. He especially spoke to and for the young, regularly beating Clinton among primary voters younger than 30. Even among African-Americans, who otherwise heavily favored Clinton, those younger than 30 preferred Sanders. Because he has never been a creature of the establishment, inside or outside the party, Sanders seems new and fresh and even youthful in a sense. Biden, despite his eight years at Obama's side, remains rooted in the much older world of Washington that greeted him as a freshman senator in 1973 \u2014 nearly half a century ago. On the other hand, if Biden suffers from all this, will the main beneficiary really be another white man in his late 70s? If the fundamental issue is the male sense of entitlement regarding women's bodies and personal space \u2014 and the lack of socially enforced boundaries \u2014 that message may need a more natural messenger. Someone with an innate sense of what women still experience in this country. Someone, like, a woman.",

Many are workers from one of the company's facilities in Erie County, which flipped from voting for Barack Obama to Donald Trump in 2016. It was a frigid 15 degrees on the picket line along the railroad tracks in Wilmerding, Pa. More than 100 union members and activists chanted slogans of solidarity and in favor of a fair contract with Wabtec Corporation \u2014 a company that builds freight train locomotives. It turned out to be the final hours of a nine-day walkout by 1,700 workers. The manufacturing jobs based in Erie, Pa., that they were defending have been threatened for a while. But President Trump promised this constituency a more secure future, and he made significant inroads with the white, working-class vote in a county that has both factories and lots of farmland. Trump carried Erie County \u2014 just barely \u2014 in 2016, following easy victories there by Barack Obama in the previous two presidential elections. Erie was one of 206 counties nationwide that flipped from supporting Obama to backing Trump. It's impossible to know exactly how union households in Erie County voted in 2016 (national exit polls showed Hillary Clinton winning about 51 percent of voters in union households, down 7 percent from support for Obama in 2012). But with Trump taking Erie County by fewer than 2,000 votes and the state by fewer than 50,000 votes, he can't afford to lose too many supporters. Union members remain divided, not just on whether to support a Democrat in 2020, but on whether Trump is delivering on his promises. Sixty-year-old union member Sharon Ruperto twice voted for Obama for president, but in 2016 she cast her ballot for Trump. She said Democrats have moved too far to the left. \"They're socialists,\" says Ruperto, a materials handler at the plant. Asked if she's happy with Trump, she says, \"Yes, I am.\" But Ruperto admits to having some misgivings early on. \"I didn't think Trump was the great one either, but he's proved to be a lot better than what I thought he was.\" She adds, \"I thought he was going to be like any other president.\" Ruperto says she was wrong about that, and instead she's pleased that Trump has been so determined to shake up Washington and not play by the usual rules. She applauds how he's taken on China on trade and has pushed companies like Ford and GM to bring manufacturing back to the U.S. The unemployment rate in Erie County has improved by about 2 points since January of 2016 when Trump took office. It's now 4.7 percent. But Kenneth Louie, an economist with Penn State Erie, The Behrend College, says the picture isn't as rosy for manufacturing jobs in the county. Louie says if you only look at the two years Trump has been in office, \"manufacturing employment has still been falling,\" though at a slower rate of decline. It's a long-term trend, according to the economist. Twenty years ago, more than 1 in 5 jobs in Erie County were in manufacturing. Now, it's down to about 1 in 8 jobs. Much of it, Louie says, is due to technology. It takes fewer workers to achieve the same level of production. The Wabtec plant in Erie, previously owned by GE Transportation, once employed more than 10,000 workers. Now its unionized workforce is 1,700, and there's no sign of that number growing significantly. Union member Ron Dombkowski said he was a rally-going Trump supporter \"because I wanted to keep jobs in America.\" Today, he sees pressure to cut wages at his own plant. Dombkowski sees the big General Motors Lordstown assembly plant closing nearby, in northeast Ohio. He sees his son, even with a college degree, struggling to make a decent wage. Asked about Trump, Dombkowski spoke softly, saying he expected a lot more from the president. He explained that it's not all bad when it comes to Trump. Dombkowski noted that, as a military veteran, he thinks Trump has been good for veterans and for the armed forces. \"So I mean, yeah, there's still things I like about Donald Trump, but I think he's letting the American worker down,\" he said. Dombkowski said he doesn't see the president fulfilling his promise to restore good manufacturing jobs, so Trump no longer has his vote. Union member Dale Meyer, 60, said it's a divided union, plain and simple, when it comes to the president. \"I mean, there are some of us that do agree with Trump, and there's a lot of people that don't agree with Trump,\" he said. Meyer explained that he and his wife split their vote. He was for Trump, while she cast her ballot for Hillary Clinton. \"Yes she did. I didn't know that until after the fact,\" Meyer said, then added with a smile, \"but we still love each other so that's something.\" Meyer paused before answering whether he is still with Trump. Then, an affirmative reply \u2014 sort of: \"I'm not against him.\" But he confided that he is not yet committed to a candidate for 2020, adding that there's lots of time to sort that out. And while he was happy to talk that day on the picket line, Meyer said he tries to avoid the topic. \"I stay out of politics because it's just too polarizing anymore,\" he said. \"It's tearing our nation apart. It really is.\" Scott Slawson, president of the UE Workers local in Erie, was not surprised by the disparate opinions about Trump among his membership, even among people who voted for the president. This part of the world was once a Democratic stronghold. But after 2016, Slawson said, Democrats better have learned an important lesson: Never to take votes for granted. \"I think one of the fatal mistakes that was made was the Democrats just simply overlooked this county,\" he said. The last presidential campaign season, the UE endorsed Bernie Sanders. He's still a favorite of many of its members, but Slawson said it's too early to know if they'll formally back any of the Democrats running in 2020. As for union members who voted Trump, Slawson said they've always made up their own minds.",

            "article_content": "Voters went to the polls in Thailand, five years after the military seized power in a coup.  LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST: Voters went to the polls today in Thailand. It's that country's first election since the 2014 military coup. The current prime minister and army chief who led that coup is attempting to retain power. For more, we're joined by reporter Michael Sullivan in Bangkok. Hey, Michael. MICHAEL SULLIVAN, BYLINE: Hi, Lulu. GARCIA-NAVARRO: All right. So what's the scene been like at the polls? What have you heard from voters? SULLIVAN: Lots of different things in lots of different places - I went to a polling station this morning in an upmarket area of Bangkok. And not surprisingly, many people I spoke to there said they want the coup leader, Prayut Chan-o-cha, to stay. They like the stability that the military government has provided. And they want him to continue. Now, a small number of people in that same district actually expressed some admiration and said they were voting for a new player on the scene, a 40-year-old billionaire who started a new party called Future Forward. And they like his policies. He's anti-military. And he's not like one of the old parties. And that's something that a lot of younger voters like. And there's 7 million young voters voting for the first time in this election. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Any idea how this is going to play out? SULLIVAN: Well, I went to a - some other polling stations in other parts of Bangkok. And those were in more working-class districts. And, you know, support for the party of the deposed prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra was high in those places. So it's too early to tell what the result is going to be. It's too early to tell if Prayut is going to win and become prime minister again or if the opposition can manage to cobble together some kind of a coalition government to oppose him. GARCIA-NAVARRO: As we mentioned, Thailand's been under military rule. This is the first time that they are actually being able to exercise their sort of democratic rights. How is that being received? SULLIVAN: Very well - I mean, people have been frustrated because they say that the books have been cooked on this one, that the coup leaders have done everything they can to try to stay in power. For example, there's this 250-seat Senate that's going to be entirely appointed by the military. But at the same time, these people are frustrated. They haven't been able to vote. The last vote was seven years ago. This is the - it's been five years since the coup. This election has been repeatedly delayed while the military gets its ducks in order. And so people were happy to come out today. But there was also apprehension because a lot of people said even though they like the idea of voting, they sort of felt that if it didn't go the military's way, that the military would try to do something to remain in power either way. GARCIA-NAVARRO: And just briefly, what are people voting about? What are the issues that are motivating them? SULLIVAN: For a lot of people, it's a simple question of economics. They like the fact that the military has kept things quiet. There's been peace and quiet here because, you know, before, there were lots of street demonstrations. There was violence. That's why the military said it had to step in. But a lot of people are really, really frustrated at the idea that the military has been in power for five years and has now tried to engineer this election so that they remain in power either behind the scenes or upfront for who knows how long. GARCIA-NAVARRO: So with that being the case and a lot of questions about how legitimate this election will be, what are you hearing? SULLIVAN: There are some allegations of irregularities coming from both sides. So we haven't really seen anything. And we have early exit polling results that show the race is just too close to call right now. We don't know yet. GARCIA-NAVARRO: That's Michael Sullivan in Bangkok. Thank you so much. SULLIVAN: You're welcome, Lulu. (SOUNDBITE OF FOUR TET'S \"CIRCLING\") Copyright \u00a9 2019 NPR.  All rights reserved.

After a flurry of people jumping into the presidential race, this past week a rare thing happened: A bunch of people jumped out. But their decision to pass on the race could be an indication that an even bigger candidate is close to launching a campaign: former Vice President Joe Biden. Biden has made no secret that he's serious about a run at the White House, after bowing out four years ago following the death of his son. Questions remain about how much the former Delaware senator, who would be almost 78 on Election Day, could appeal to a changing Democratic Party that's awash in a desire for a younger, progressive candidate to energize its base. But the potential candidates who passed this week would have offered voters some of the same attributes as Biden, and their decisions to sit out in 2020 may signal a clearing of the field for the elder statesman. The New York Times, citing officials familiar with the discussions, reported on Thursday that Biden's chief strategist has recently called several potential candidates to tell them Biden is \"95 percent committed to running.\" Around the time that story ran, a trickle of \"no's\" began. Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, a former Republican and independent, announced he wouldn't run on Tuesday. Bloomberg is more of a centrist who has been known to reach across the aisle \u2014 as Biden often did during his decades in the Senate, in addition to retaining close friendships with Republicans. The Times also reported that Bloomberg's advisers saw Biden as major hurdle, with many focus groups fawning over Biden's \"Uncle Joe\" persona. Former Attorney General Eric Holder is another member of the Obama administration who was testing the waters but ultimately decided against jumping in this week. Like Holder, Biden has made voting rights a priority in his post-administration days. Perhaps Biden's biggest potential ideological rival was Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown, who conducted a \"dignity of work\" tour through several early states before announcing on Thursday that he would not run. Brown would have appealed to the same white working-class, populist base as Biden \u2014 voters who proved to be Hillary Clinton's Achilles heel in 2016. As a proud native of Scranton, Pa., Biden has an edge in the very states that President Trump captured to win the presidency \u2014 Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. Steve Schale, a Florida Democratic strategist who was part of the \"Draft Biden\" initiative in 2016, acknowledged the potential crossover between Biden and Brown, but he argued that the former vice president's appeal to that group stretches even further. \"I think there are probably elements of Brown's coalition that would look to a Biden-type candidate. But I think as we've seen in early polling, it's not like Joe Biden only pulls from one lane of the Democratic Party,\" Schale said. \"He does well with Middle America, working-class voters, with African-Americans and Hispanics, and you don't see a huge gender gap with his vote.\" Republicans will even privately \u2014 and sometimes publicly \u2014 acknowledge that Biden worries them with a cross-party appeal that someone like Bloomberg also might have offered. The growing primary field isn't devoid of that centrist position, however; former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper made a middle-of-the-road pitch as he launched his campaign. Still, Biden is by far the most imposing figure sitting on the sidelines, and this week's notable withdrawals leave him as one of the biggest lingering variables as the 2020 field takes shape. While Biden has been the front-runner in early polls, those often aren't good predictors of final results. Longtime Democratic pollster Peter Hart is skeptical of early surveys that show Biden with a lead, given the type of change the party base seems hungriest for. The gaffe-prone politician will also face questions about his background on civil rights, criminal justice issues and more. \"If he thinks of himself as the Colossus of Rhodes and everyone sort of has to maneuver around him or through him, I think he will get off to the wrong start,\" Hart cautioned. Even a politician who spent over four decades in Washington can still draw voters, though. Hart, who frequently conducts focus groups across the country, said it will depend on the type of campaign Biden sets out to run. \"It's not that Joe Biden can't reach across the entire Democratic spectrum, because he can. He's liked and respected by all elements within the Democratic Party. I think it is about his agenda and his outlook,\" Hart said. \"If his outlook is the head that's turning behind or back, versus the forward-looking outlook, I think he's going to have a hard time. Because this is about tomorrow \u2014 it's not going to be about yesterday.\" Someone like former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke, who's also still weighing a campaign, could challenge Biden there. The 2018 Senate candidate who came closer than expected to knocking off GOP Sen. Ted Cruz could offer a blend of that same populism but mixed with a younger progressivism. Likewise, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar has a proven Rust Belt appeal, while also bringing gender diversity to the field. But Schale, who says he will support Biden if he gets in, points out that it's Biden whom the party often looked to during the midterms and other tough elections as one of its most valuable surrogates. \"He was the one Democrat that was asked to go to all corners of our country and all corners of our coalition, and I think that speaks to the brand he brings to the race,\" the Florida Democratic strategist said. Mo Elleithee, a former Democratic National Committee spokesman who worked on Hillary Clinton's 2008 campaign, said he thinks it's likely that both Bloomberg and Brown had other reasons for not running beyond just Biden. But, Elleithee said, Biden still casts a wide shadow on a race he has not even entered yet. \"There's an authenticity about him, that he is who he is and everyone knows that,\" said Elleithee, who now directs Georgetown University's Institute of Politics and Public Service. \"When he speaks, particularly about helping the middle class, he does it in a very populist way that I think a lot of people can connect with, and that's nothing to sneeze at in this day and age.\" And while there is a clamoring for progressive candidates \u2014 such as Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders or California Sen. Kamala Harris \u2014 Elleithee argued that if Biden does get in, he may ultimately have more grassroots appeal and can make the case that he can best go toe-to-toe with Trump. \"Outside of the Beltway, people aren't talking about moderate vs. progressive. What they're talking about is, 'Who gets me and understands that I'm feeling the squeeze and I'm feeling left behind?' \" Elleithee said. \"And I think Biden gets that, and he can speak to that in a very authentic way.\"",

Former Vice President Joe Biden is inching closer to jumping into the 2020 presidential race, saying Tuesday that his family is behind another run for the White House. \"The first hurdle for me was deciding whether or not I am comfortable taking the family through what would be a very, very, very difficult campaign,\" Biden said during an interview with presidential historian Jon Meacham at the University of Delaware. But among those dearest to him, Biden said, \"There is a consensus that they want me to run.\" He also said he's \"very close\" to a final decision \u2014 that includes input from his wife Jill, son Hunter, daughter Ashley and his grandchildren, who had \"prodded\" him to launch a campaign for president. \"We do everything by family meetings, because no man or woman has a right to run for public office without it being a family decision,\" the former longtime Delaware senator said. Even with their blessing, the 76-year-old Democrat still sounded somewhat hesitant given what is sure to be a grueling campaign involving a crowded Democratic primary field and likely a brutal general election campaign to try to unseat President Trump. \"No matter who runs \u2014 it's a very difficult campaign,\" Biden said. \"The primary will be very difficult. And the general election, running against President Trump, I don't think that he's likely to stop at anything, whomever he runs against.\" Family concerns were largely what kept Biden from running in 2016 to succeed his boss President Barack Obama. His eldest son, Beau, had just passed away in 2015 from brain cancer at only 46 years old. Biden struggled with whether he could mount a credible campaign while dealing with such a significant loss; eventually, he decided the time had passed for him to run. \"As my family and I have worked through the grieving process, I've said all along what I've said time and again to others, that it may very well be that the process by the time we get through it closes the window. I've concluded it has closed,\" Biden said in the White House Rose Garden in October 2015 alongside his wife and Obama. But Biden has clearly missed being in the mix, after a nearly four-decade career in the Senate before becoming vice president. He has been urged to run by many in his party who believe he could appeal to white, working-class voters that 2016 nominee Hillary Clinton failed to win over from Trump \u2014 leading to the president's crucial wins in Rust Belt states like Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan. However, the Democratic race for the 2020 nomination is shaping up to be a primary battle unlike in previous elections, with a push for a more progressive candidate and many who argue it's time for a younger, more diverse standard-bearer as well. A dozen Democratic hopefuls have already entered the race, including several senators, minority and women candidates. Those variables also seemed to be factoring into Biden's looming decision, as he told the crowd Tuesday that \"the second piece is that I don't want this to be a fool's errand, and I want to make sure that if we do this, and we're very close to getting to a decision, that I am fully prepared to do it.\" Biden said things would be much different from his past runs for office given the new media landscape, the growing importance of social media and whether he can \"fund this campaign on my conditions,\" including not having a superPAC. The former vice president said he was also looking into finding out \"this alleged appeal that I have \u2014 how deep does it run? Is it real?\" \"I can die a happy man having never lived in the White House,\" Biden said. \"But what I don't want to do is I don't want to take people's time, effort and commitment without there being a clear shot that I could be the nominee. I think we can.\" \"I think that's where we are, but there's still a couple hurdles to go through to make sure we have all this in place and we conclude that \u2014 I would announce, and I would run for president.\" As Biden began to close his remarks, someone in the crowd yelled, \"Just say yes,\" and Biden smiled and responded, \"But I'm not there yet.\" \"I have not made the final decision \u2014 but don't be surprised,\" he teased.",

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., announced the selection of Abrams on Tuesday, saying he extended the offer to her about three weeks ago and was excited she had accepted to give the rebuttal on Feb. 5. \"She is just a great spokesperson. She is an incredible leader,\" Schumer told reporters at the Capitol. \"She has led the charge for voting rights, which is at the root of just about everything else.

At a moment when our nation needs to hear from leaders who can unite for a common purpose, I am honored to be delivering the Democratic State of the Union response. https://t.co/0dpA3lJZpS Abrams became a rising star within the Democratic Party as she was trying to become the nation's first African-American female governor last year. The former Georgia House minority leader lost by almost 55,000 votes against Republican Brian Kemp, the then-secretary of state who came under fire for alleged voter suppression tactics. Abrams held out after Election Day, hoping that absentee and provisional ballots could push her to a runoff, but in an impassioned speech 10 days later, she admitted there wasn't a path to victory but underscored this wasn't a concession from her. \"Pundits and hyperpartisans will hear my words as a rejection of the normal order. You see, I'm supposed to say nice things and accept my fate. They will complain that I should not use this moment to recap what was done wrong or to demand a remedy. You see, as a leader, I should be stoic in my outrage and silent in my rebuke,\" Abrams said. \"But stoicism is a luxury and silence is a weapon for those who would quiet the voices of the people. And I will not concede because the erosion of our democracy is not right.\" Abrams is also being courted as a possible Senate candidate in 2020 to challenge Georgia Republican Sen. David Perdue.",

Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, looks on during a press conference on Capitol Hill in December 2018. Updated at 7:18 a.m. ET Ohio Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown took a step towards a 2020 presidential campaign, announcing a tour of states holding early presidential primaries next year. Seeking to counter President Trump's appeal to white, working-class voters that helped him flip Ohio and other key midwestern states, Brown is launching a \"Dignity of Work\" tour through Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina. \"Too many Democrats, the national Democratic Party, sees this in kind of this false choice of Democrats speak to the progressive base, or speak to working class families regardless of race. I think you need to do both,\" Brown told NPR's Morning Edition on Wednesday. Brown said he would ultimately decide whether to run in March, after his tour. These are Brown's first trips to these key early states as the 2020 campaign starts. New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, who announced she's running on Tuesday, will be visiting Iowa this weekend. Ultimately as many as two dozen Democrats may run. \"I hope that they all adopt the dignity of work,\" Brown said. \"I think we need to win in the heartland,\" he added, emphasizing the need to do so by appealing to progressives and working class voters across different races. Brown is a longtime lawmaker, but someone who's not sought the spotlight as much as some of his other Senate colleagues who also might run. Brown served as Ohio's secretary of state in the 1980s and was then elected to Congress in 1992. He represented the Cleveland suburbs in the House until he was elected to the Senate in 2006, defeating Republican incumbent Mike DeWine. After winning re-election last year in a state that President Trump carried amid other GOP statewide victories, chatter of a possible Brown presidential bid began to bubble up, and the Ohio senator said he was considering running. \"I didn't grow up aspiring to be president of the United States,\" Brown told NPR shortly after the 2018 midterm elections. \"My dream was to play center field for the Cleveland Indians, and I think that door is closed. So right after the election, my wife, Connie, and I just had an overwhelming number of people saying, with what you did in Ohio, with your message in Ohio, with your fight for workers ongoing - that you should think about doing this.\" A strong ally of labor unions, Brown hopes his brand of economic populism can counter Trump's strength with blue collar voters in the Midwest and elsewhere in the country. Like Trump, he's criticized trade deals such as NAFTA and supports some tariffs on imported products. He referred to Trump on Wednesday as a \"phony\" populist. \"Candidate Trump campaigned as a populist, then he governed as a royalist,\" he said. Brown criticized Trump for manufacturing his branded products with low wage labor overseas and contrasted his rhetoric with Trump, saying he does not pit workers in other countries against American workers or use \"racist\" language. Hillary Clinton has said she considered Brown as a vice presidential running mate on the 2016 Democratic ticket before choosing Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va. After Democrats performed badly in 2016 among white, working-class voters, which helped flip Ohio, Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania to the GOP, Brown also told NPR last year that defeating Trump means focusing on the concerns of workers. If Brown decides to run, he'd face a growing field. Aside from Gillibrand, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, and former Housing and Urban Development Sec. Juli\u00e1n Castro have announced they're running, with many others still considering whether to launch campaigns and likely to join by the time Brown decides in March.",

There was a time when \"Medicare for All\" was not a part of Sen. Elizabeth Warren's presidential campaign. It was March. \"For me, what's key is we get everybody at the table on this,\" was her noncommittal answer when asked about it at a CNN town hall on March 18. She was a co-sponsor of Sen. Bernie Sanders' signature single-payer health care bill (He \"wrote the damn bill,\" as you might recall), but had backed other health overhaul bills, as she told CNN's Jake Tapper. By the time of the first primary debate, in June, she was firmly behind Medicare for All. \"I'm with Bernie on Medicare for All,\" Warren declared. During this period, the Massachusetts senator also gained ground as the woman with a plan for everything. But she didn't have her own plan for health care. Sanders' bill that Warren backed didn't lay out for certain the details of how to pay for it. Rather, he had a list of possible options. So Warren faced a new question, pressed most consistently by South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg. He chided her during October's debate: \"Your signature, senator, is to have a plan for everything. Except this.\" In addition, when asked about whether she'd raise taxes on the middle class to pay for the plan, Warren responded that costs wouldn't go up \u2014 a move her opponents cast as evasive. Sanders said that taxes would go up on the middle class, while also promising that overall costs would go down. By the time Warren came up with both a way to pay for Medicare for All and a plan to transition to it, the issue was a key way that opponents were attacking her \u2014 and, potentially, a key factor in her declining support among Democratic voters. Releasing her plans didn't appear to help her regain that ground. When asked about the link between her sagging poll numbers and Medicare for All, the Warren camp told NPR that its broad focus remains unchanged. \"Since day one, we've been talking about what's broken, our plans to fix it, and building a grassroots movement for big, structural change,\" said a statement from the Warren campaign. \"We will continue doing that.\" Adam Green, a co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which has endorsed Warren, believes that Buttigieg's attacks rattled voters. \"What's happened recently is that Pete Buttigieg has used insurance industry talking points to scare progressive, scared electability voters into having self-doubt and thinking that the most electable candidate might not be electable,\" Green said. He also points to the fact that Medicare for All is popular among Democrats. A November Kaiser Family Foundation poll indeed found that 77% of Democrats \"somewhat\" or \"strongly favor\" Medicare for All. However, 88% support a public option, which Buttigieg and other more moderate candidates are backing. It found that a public option is also more popular among the broader electorate. For his part, Buttigieg has responded to the charge of using industry talking points by himself pointing to the insurance industry. \"Well, the insurance companies are fighting my proposal, because they don't want the competition,\" he told ABC's George Stephanopoulos in November. \"What is just not true is that hers is the only solution.\" A health care industry coalition, the Partnership for America's Health Care Future, has run ads against a public option, though it has also run ads and fought against Medicare for All. It's not just that attacks from opponents hurt Warren, according to Chris Jennings, who served as a health care adviser to Presidents Clinton and Obama. \"I think she created a box from which she could not escape,\" he said. Jennings says that voters' perception of Warren was shaken by the fact that Warren said she wouldn't raise costs for middle-class families but then didn't have a plan immediately at the ready. \"That actually was very, very different from virtually all other elements of the Warren campaign, which I think were very clearly enunciated in terms of policy vision and financing mechanisms and not even a hesitation to respond to any critique \u2014 in fact, almost a welcome embrace of those fights,\" he said. \"This one felt a bit more like she was on the defensive.\" But on the campaign trail, Warren's message is close to what it has been from the beginning. At a recent New Hampshire town hall, she focused on corruption, and health care barely featured in her stump speech. However, she does get asked about it. One voter who had questions at a recent town hall in Peterborough, N.H., was Jonathan Queen. \"I'm not sure that I'm on board with Medicare for All,\" he told NPR. Queen is from Mauldin, S.C., but he happened to be near Warren's New Hampshire town hall for medical appointments in Boston. He was diagnosed eight years ago with stage 4 esophageal cancer. \"I'm alive because of a drug-sponsored clinical trial,\" he said. \"That is also extremely important. We need to find a balance between reasonable drug prices and maintaining profit motive to spur innovation and bring those types of things forward.\" Queen got to ask Warren about this; she said she wants to boost funding for government medical research and improve the FDA approval process to keep innovation strong. Even given Queen's doubts about Medicare for All, he said that Warren is his first choice. Voters like Nancy Lindberg are less sure. Standing in line for a photo with the candidate, she said that she's considering both Warren and Buttigieg. Lindberg added that health care is her top issue. \"I support universal health care,\" she said. \"I'm still bending toward the side of, we already have the ACA. Can that be improved upon? Do we have to throw that out to start all over again?\" And that's the kind of voter Warren is targeting. Nearly two-thirds of Democrats say that they haven't chosen a candidate yet, according to a recent Quinnipiac poll, or that their minds might still change.",

            "article_content": "Elizabeth Warren's campaign has seen a slump in support recently, as she has committed to details of a highly-anticipated Medicare for All plan. Has her handling of the issue turned voters off?  AILSA CHANG, HOST: And now to the election on this side of the Atlantic. So far, \"Medicare for All\" has been the issue of the Democratic primary. In recent months, it has come to define the campaign of Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren. And as it's become a bigger and bigger part of her platform, she's lost support from Democratic voters. NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben looks at why. DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN, BYLINE: In Elizabeth Warren's speech announcing her presidential campaign, health care came up just a couple of times in passing. Instead, this was the heart of her message. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ELIZABETH WARREN: When government works only for the wealthy and the well-connected, that is corruption, plain and simple. KURTZLEBEN: But then health care became the central debate in the early part of the primary campaign. And as of a CNN town hall in March, she was noncommittal on Medicare for All, despite co-sponsoring Senator Bernie Sanders' single-payer bill. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) WARREN: I think we get everybody together. KURTZLEBEN: By the time of the first primary debates in June, she was firmly behind it. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) WARREN: So yes, I'm with Bernie on Medicare for All. And let me tell you why. KURTZLEBEN: Warren gained ground during this period as the woman with a plan for everything. So Warren faced a new question, pressed most consistently by South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg.

By the time she released her proposal to pay for it, her poll numbers were sliding. And that trend continued. Adam Green is a co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which has endorsed Warren. He believes that Buttigieg's attacks worked. He spoke to NPR via Skype. ADAM GREEN: Pete Buttigieg has used insurance industry talking points to scare progressive - scared electability voters into having self-doubt. KURTZLEBEN: Here's how Buttigieg responded to that charge on ABC. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BUTTIGIEG: Well, the insurance companies are fighting my proposal because they don't want the competition. What is just not true is that hers is the only solution. KURTZLEBEN: Buttigieg supports a public option. Health insurance lobbyists have run ads against Warren's plan and his. It's not just that attacks from opponents hurt Warren, according to Chris Jennings, who served as a health care adviser to Presidents Clinton and Obama.

            "article_content": "Credit:  NPR Joe Biden is dismissing calls from President Trump and his allies that Biden testify during an impeachment trial in the Senate, saying any effort to compel his testimony should be viewed as part of a strategy to distract from the president's conduct. \"No, I'm not going to let you take the eye off the ball here. Everybody knows what this is about,\" the former vice president told NPR when asked whether he would cooperate with a subpoena. \"This is a Trump gambit he plays. Whenever he's in trouble he tries to find someone else to divert attention to.\" Asked a second time whether he would comply with a subpoena, Biden said: \"No, I will not yield to what everybody is looking for here. And that is to take the eye off the ball.\" He added, \"No one has ... one scintilla of evidence that I did anything other than do my job for America as well as anybody could have done it.\" Biden was referring to attacks from Trump directed at Biden's son Hunter, who took a lucrative job as a board member of a Ukrainian energy company when the elder Biden was vice president and oversaw Ukraine policy for the Obama White House. The Bidens' dealings in Ukraine became a top focus of Trump and his Republican allies, and House Democrats are now preparing to impeach the president over allegations that he abused his office by pressuring Ukrainian authorities to open an investigation into the Bidens and other Democrats while crucial military aid was on hold. Hunter Biden has said that joining the board of gas company Burisma Holdings was the result of \"poor judgment,\" since it fueled his father's critics. Last Thursday, President Trump tweeted that the former vice president and his son would both be among those who would testify in a Senate impeachment trial. \"We will have Schiff, the Bidens, Pelosi and many more testify, and will reveal, for the first time, how corrupt our system really is,\" the president wrote. State Department official George Kent testified in the impeachment probe that while he didn't see any improper behavior by Biden, he did warn his staff in early 2015 about possible perceptions of a conflict of interest, and that he was told the then-vice president could not deal with the issue at the time since his other son Beau was in the final months of his life suffering from brain cancer. \"Nobody warned me about a potential conflict of interest. Nobody warned me about that,\" Biden said. He added, \"They should have told me.\" Despite the optics, the former vice president underscored that his son did nothing improper. \"The appearance looked bad and it gave folks like Rudy Giuliani an excuse to come up with a Trumpian kind of defense, while they were violating the Constitution,\" Biden said. Campaign clashes In a wide-ranging interview with NPR, while Biden was campaigning in Iowa, the Democratic front-runner said his long career in politics makes him best positioned to restore America's standing on the world stage. Biden said his health care plan is more \"realistic\" than policies proposed by some other Democratic contenders. And he defended calling an Iowa voter a \"damn liar\" after the voter, who identified himself as a retired farmer, questioned whether the former vice president was too old to run for president and challenged his family's dealings in Ukraine. Credit:  NPR Biden name-calling a voter drew comparisons to Trump's blunt and sometimes coarse style, a parallel that Biden strenuously rejected. Trump, he said, \"makes fun of people. He belittles people. He lies. I don't do any of those things. Period. The fact of the matter is this guy stood up, and he was, in fact, lying. And I just pointed out, 'You're a liar.' It's a fact. He lied. Period,\" Biden said. When asked about the health care proposals of some of his opponents \u2014 such as Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, each of whom supports \"Medicare for All\" plans \u2014 Biden sounded skeptical. \"Do you think it's remotely possible to raise $3.5 trillion a year, more than every single penny we spend on every single thing in the federal government on a yearly basis, without raising taxes on the middle class? If you answer that question, then I'm ending the interview because you know it's not true,\" Biden said. \"You gotta raise taxes.\" He did not name any other Democratic candidates by name, but he said his opponents are \"bright\" and \"honorable people,\" though he argued that some of the bold proposals sparking policy debates do not have a real shot of ever becoming law in America. \"All the things we're talking about, none of it matters, even if you defeat Trump, unless you can pass it,\" Biden said. What's driving the Biden campaign Biden's decades in Democratic politics have allowed him to meet leaders around the world, experience that he said should give him an edge on foreign policy matters. \"I know all of these world leaders, even the ones that we don't like very much like Putin. I know him. He knows I know who he is, and he knows who I am. There's no misunderstanding about who we are. And it's really important,\" Biden said. Biden continued: \"Think about this. If we don't figure out how to bring the world together again, reassure our allies, making sure that our, that those who are opponents know we understand what they're about and we're going to do something about it. Where do we go? What happens in five years? If this, if the president's reelected, you think there'll be a NATO? Do you think there will be national security arrangements we have with European countries? What do you think? I don't think it's possible. I think they'll be gone.\" While Biden has for months maintained a commanding lead in national polls, he has struggled to capture large numbers of younger and more liberal members of the Democratic Party. When asked what might explain the apparent enthusiasm gap, Biden shot back: \"There isn't an enthusiasm gap! What the hell are you talking about?\" He added: \"Come with me on college campuses. You don't see that.\" However, while Biden holds a lead in national polling among Democratic voters, he consistently trails Sanders among voters under 30. Biden's decision to run for president for the third time in his political career is a direct response to President Trump, who he said has placed the U.S. in \"a deep, deep, deep hole.\" \"This is absolutely a guy who is damaging us around the world. And the issues that need to be dealt with now are issues that have been in my wheelhouse my whole life,\" Biden said. \"How can I walk away? I'm not joking. I'm not saying I'm a savior. But they're the issues that were in my wheelhouse my whole life.\" Watch the full conversation here.

            "article_content": "Democrats will debate Wednesday night in the midst of an impeachment inquiry, and with a field in flux after Pete Buttigieg's recent surge.  AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: Ten presidential candidates will debate on stage in Atlanta tonight. And since the last time they met, a lot has changed in this primary race. We're joined now by two members of our political team. NPR's Domenico Montanaro, welcome back. DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Hey, there. CORNISH: You're in Atlanta, right? MONTANARO: I am not in Atlanta. CORNISH: Wait. MONTANARO: But I am in D.C. and will be watching it with you all. CORNISH: So who's in Atlanta? NPR's political correspondent Asma Khalid, I hope. MONTANARO: There we go. ASMA KHALID, BYLINE: Yes, that's right. CORNISH: (Laughter) OK, good - on the line Atlanta. So, Asma, we've had candidates dropping out, new candidates on the scene. Who's actually on the stage tonight? KHALID: So there will be 10 candidates onstage. We've got Joe Biden, Cory Booker, Pete Buttigieg, Tulsi Gabbard, Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, Bernie Sanders, Tom Steyer, Elizabeth Warren and Andrew Yang - just wanted to run through them all. I think, though, Audie, what's notable is also who will not be there. This is the first time that former Obama Housing Secretary Julian Castro will not be a part of the debates. And also, former Texas congressman Beto O'Rourke has also dropped out since the last debate. So that's sort of a change from the previous debates. The last thing I'd mention is that, you know, since the most recent debate, we've also just had a new entrant to this race. That's the former governor of Massachusetts, Deval Patrick. He, of course, will not be on the debate stage. He hasn't had the time to get the donors or the polls to make it on. But he's a new entrant. And also, there's talk about possibly the former mayor of New York City Michael Bloomberg getting in as well. CORNISH: Domenico, heading into the last debate, it was Elizabeth Warren who was on the rise, and then that meant she got all the scrutiny during the debate. This time, we've got Pete Buttigieg getting all the kind of good press and rise in the polls. So how could that affect the dynamic of the race? MONTANARO: Well, and anytime there's a rise, there's going to be that person facing scrutiny. And I think that's going to be Pete Buttigieg. Is he going to be able to stand up to the heat in this debate? I think it's going to be the first time that you see him targeted by some of the other contenders. Elizabeth Warren had been rising, as you noted, but she's seeing a real slipping in the polls given her support for Medicare for All and her plan having been released and lots of worries from Democrats, especially Democrats in the establishment who think that it's too far left and could cost them in the suburbs. On the other hand, you've got Joe Biden, the former vice president, who'd been the one to sort of get all of the scrutiny for most of this year who's been sort of steady lately and probably won't see the same kind of scrutiny. And he'll have the opportunity to kind of go on the attack. So if he's - comes across as statesmanlike and steady, it could be beneficial to him, especially when he's not the battering ram - and, by the way, getting lots of goodwill off of these impeachment hearings. CORNISH: Asma, that's the outside view. What are you hearing from the campaigns themselves? KHALID: Well, I would echo what Domenico just said there about the Biden campaign. I was at a briefing earlier this afternoon with some senior Biden officials. And they point to the fact that the polling shows he has been remarkably resilient throughout this campaign cycle. You know, there are some candidates who have gone up and down. They point to his strength right now in some states like South Carolina and Nevada to say that he's actually has a fairly broad, diverse coalition. So they feel fairly confident coming in tonight. CORNISH: On the issues, health care has dominated these debates. Now Elizabeth Warren has put out her plan to pay for Medicare for All without raising middle-class taxes. And she was pressed really hard on this during the last debate. What are you going to be watching for in that area tonight? KHALID: Well, since the last debate, she has put out two plans on health care. The first was how she intends to pay for a Medicare for All system without raising middle-class taxes. She released that a few weeks ago. And in it, she specifies that she will not raise a penny of middle-class taxes. And then the other plan that she put out just last Friday was how she intends to transition to a Medicare for All system. In her view, that's a two-step process, so she would not fully move to a Medicare for All system until the third year of her presidency. And so what's really interesting to me is that, you know, now she has put out a lot of details. In the last debate, she was criticized for lack of details. But in putting out details, she has now given a number of other campaigns, a number of other candidates, fodder to attack her, I would say both from the left and some of the more centrist candidates as well. CORNISH: And, Domenico, the impeachment hearings are going on. How does this affect what we're going to see on stage tonight? MONTANARO: Well, look; I mean, lots of people have been paying such close attention. Today was a monumental day on Capitol Hill with the testimony of EU ambassador - European Union Ambassador Gordon Sondland. The MP - latest NPR/PBS Newshour/Marist poll shows that more than three-quarters of Democrats haven't made up their mind yet on who they want to vote for, which makes these debate even - debates - even more consequential the closer we get to those early-state votes. CORNISH: That's NPR's Domenico Montanaro and Asma Khalid looking forward to tonight's Democratic debate in Atlanta. Thanks for the preview. MONTANARO: You're welcome. KHALID: You're welcome.

But a lot more than the path to impeachment has changed since the Democratic candidates last gathered on the debate stage. New candidates have entered \u2014 and semi-entered \u2014 the race, though neither former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick nor former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg will be in Wednesday's debate. South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg has taken Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren's place as the surging candidate of the moment. And after months of catering to the progressive activist wing of the party, more and more candidates are now focusing their pitches on moderate voters. Here are four key questions ahead of Wednesday's debate: 1) Can Pete take the heat? In October, Buttigieg was one of several candidates who repeatedly used their time to criticize Warren. \"Your signature, senator, is to have a plan for everything, except for this,\" he memorably said about her lack of a detailed explanation to fund a \"Medicare for All\" health care system. At the time, Warren was the candidate rising in the polls. Now, Buttigieg is moving up fast. The Des Moines Register's latest Iowa Poll shows Buttigieg with a commanding 9-point lead over Warren, former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. Other surveys also show Buttigieg polling well in New Hampshire, though struggling in the other two early contests with more diverse electorates: South Carolina and Nevada. Biden and Warren have had their turns as the front-runner in every other candidate's crosshairs. Wednesday will likely be Buttigieg's night. How will the millennial mayor answer tough questions about his lack of statewide experience, his struggle to win support from African American voters and his opposition to a Medicare for All approach to health care that has become the signature issue for Sanders and Warren? 2) Can Warren get back on offense? Warren has spent the bulk of the past month struggling to answer the critiques that Buttigieg and other rivals raised on the October debate stage: Would her health care plan raise taxes on the middle class? Why hadn't the \"plans candidate\" released the granular details on the issue that Democratic voters care about more than anything else? And just how committed was she to Medicare for All? Warren finally released her plan on Nov. 1. It would not raise middle-class taxes \u2014 though many experts were skeptical of the mix of optimistic economic and political projections the proposal relies on to make costs work. (Among them: passing comprehensive immigration reform, drastically lowering health care costs and more efficient federal tax collection.) But as Warren firmly and publicly committed to a comprehensive national health care system, more and more polls showed voters were hesitant to fully abandon their private health insurance. And last week, Warren again sowed doubt about her ultimate health care goals by announcing that she'd tackle health care in two parts: an initial public option bill right away and then a more expansive single-payer measure in her third year as president. Given that presidents rarely have the luxury of more than a handful of major legislative achievements (think tax cuts for President Trump and George W. Bush or the Affordable Care Act for Barack Obama), the announcement raised questions about whether Warren is fully committed to the plan. More than any other candidate in the race this year, Warren has been able to set her own terms for the campaign. But a month of confusing and, at times, contradictory health care messaging has opened the door to a lot of criticism Wednesday night. 3) Will Biden be a factor? (Does he need to be?) Before every debate, Biden's campaign has tried to set expectations with the same basic pitch: Other candidates with lower name ID and polling numbers would try to go viral by attacking the candidate at the top of the national polls, but Biden would ignore them and speak directly to the American people. With so much of the focus on Warren last month, Biden went long periods without even speaking and didn't figure into many of the main narratives coming out of the night. And that seemed to be just fine with Biden and his campaign. While he has faded a bit in Iowa and struggled to raise money, Biden still enjoys commanding leads in South Carolina and Nevada, as well as sitting toward the top of national polls. Biden has maintained his spot atop the field with a very non-2019 approach to politics: holding just a handful of relatively small rallies a week, doing a lot of big-donor fundraisers and generally avoiding any and all buzzy viral moments on social media. The slow-and-steady formula has worked well for Biden so far, and he may be content to once again stand to the side while other top-tier candidates take all the incoming criticism. Or, he may go on offense against Buttigieg, who has peeled off some of Biden's more moderate supporters. This more than anything else will likely set the tone of Wednesday's debate. 4) Is the top tier now fully set? The wide gulf between Biden, Warren, Sanders, Buttigieg and every other candidate remains. With fewer than 80 days remaining before the Iowa caucuses, the likelihood of one or two other candidates joining the top tier grows smaller and smaller. But the most recent NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist Poll shows that three-quarters of Democratic voters still haven't made up their mind. And as candidates like New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker and California Sen. Kamala Harris now remind voters at every campaign stop, both Iowa and New Hampshire are states that traditionally break very late in the race. Harris, Booker and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, among the other \"lower tier\" candidates, all face the same basic challenge: capture voters' attention Wednesday night with a viral moment or two that goes beyond a one- or two-day fundraising boon and news story. They need to change the way that voters think about them and create some long-term momentum that could lead to a steady rise in the polls. The goal is simple, but it's hard to achieve and hasn't really happened with any previous debate. Harris made waves in the first debate by criticizing Biden's stance on federally mandated busing, but after a few weeks of momentum she dropped in the polls and never really recovered. Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro saw a less dramatic bump after a strong showing in the first debate, but he won't be on the stage Wednesday.",

Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., has released her plan to fund single-payer health care, keeping with a pledge not to raise taxes on the middle class. Updated at 11:10 a.m. ET Sen. Elizabeth Warren says she can fund \"Medicare for All\" without raising taxes on the middle class. Instead, among other things, she would boost the wealth tax on the ultra-rich that she has promoted on the campaign trail. Warren had promised at a recent debate that she would not sign a bill that raises health care costs for the middle class. Under a plan released Friday morning, the Massachusetts senator and 2020 Democratic presidential candidate goes further: Middle class Americans would no longer pay health premiums or copays and would also not pay any new taxes to replace those costs. However, they would pay taxes on whatever extra take-home pay they would receive in this new system. However, she will boost what had been a 3% wealth tax on people with more than a billion dollars to 6%. Her plan would also have employers pay higher taxes to the government, which she says would replace what they currently pay toward private health insurance. Warren is proposing $20.5 trillion in new federal spending under the proposal. Altogether, Warren's plan says that total national health costs would not go up under the single-payer health proposal. Rather, all of the estimated $52 trillion in health spending over a decade would be paid via the federal government.",

Elizabeth Warren looks on as South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg speaks during Tuesday's Democratic presidential debate. Warren's policy positions were described as unrealistic and expensive by her rivals in the Democratic debate. After a long, steady rise in the polls, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren is now vying for front-runner status with former Vice President Joe Biden. On Tuesday night, more moderate candidates took aim at her progressive policy positions as unrealistic and expensive. \"Medicare for All\" \u2014 the single-payer health care plan supported by both Warren and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders \u2014 was the main topic in this moderate-progressive fight. Warren has been asked repeatedly about raising taxes on middle-class Americans to pay for that plan. She and Sanders were the two candidates onstage who full-throatedly support Sanders' version of Medicare for All. (Cory Booker and Kamala Harris were co-sponsors, but Harris has now come out with her own plan and Booker has backed off his support.) Moderators asked Warren, \"yes or no,\" whether she would raise taxes to pay for Medicare for All and her other plans. Warren instead made points that she regularly makes on this question: her contention that total costs under the plan will go down for middle-class Americans, while the wealthy will foot a large portion of the bill. \"Cost will go up for the wealthy, they will go up for big corporations and for middle-class families, they will go down,\" she said. \"I will not sign a bill into law that does not lower costs for middle-class families.\" The underlying argument that Warren is making is that while voters might pay higher taxes under Medicare for All, that would be more than outweighed by the elimination of health care costs like premiums or copays. She very pointedly did not say that taxes would go up \u2014 something that could be easily weaponized. South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg seized on Warren's answer and attacked. \"Well, we heard it tonight \u2014 a yes-or-no question that didn't get a yes-or-no answer,\" he said. He later added that the Sanders version of Medicare for All that Warren has endorsed would almost entirely eliminate private insurance, which stands in opposition to what many Americans want from their health care: \"I don't think the American people are wrong when they say that what they want is a choice.\" Public option vs. single payer Polls have shown that a public option plan whereby there's a government-run plan that competes with private insurers is more popular than a single-payer plan. A CBS News poll released Tuesday found that 59% of voters surveyed believe that a government-run insurance plan should \"compete with private insurance\" (as would be the case under a public option), while 32% said they would want it to replace private insurance. While Sanders' Medicare for All bill does not lay out the taxes it would impose, he has floated the idea of a 4% tax on all Americans making over $29,000 per year as one way to pay for it, along with taxes on the rich. It is possible that many middle-class families will pay less under Warren's plan. But without knowing exactly which taxes would be raised and by how much, however, it is impossible to know exactly what the effects would be, as the Washington Post reported recently. While Warren did not say it, Sanders himself did say that taxes would go up for many Americans. \"I do think it is appropriate to acknowledge that taxes will go up,\" Sanders said. \"They're going to go up significantly for the wealthy. And for virtually everybody, the tax increase they pay will be substantially less, substantially less than what they were paying for premiums and out-of-pocket expenses.\" Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar used this as an opening to also attack Warren for not directly making that point herself. \"At least Bernie is being honest here and saying how he's going to pay for this and the taxes are going up,\" she said. \"And I'm sorry, Elizabeth, but you have not said that, and I think we owe it to the American people to tell them where we're going to send the invoice.\" Warren, for her part, stuck to her main line of argument, on highlighting total costs: \"The problem we got right now is the overall cost of health care,\" she said in responding to Klobuchar. Biden later added his own input, saying that Warren was being \"vague\" in her answers. Wealth tax The idea of a wealth tax \u2014 an idea pitched by both Sanders and Warren \u2014 was also the locus of more moderates-versus-Warren arguments. Warren has made her wealth tax one of her cornerstone issues, saying that it would pay for several of her more sweeping plans, like tuition-free public college. The tenor of this debate was different, however, with the attackers saying they are open to the idea. \"I'm all for a wealth tax. I'm all for just about everything that was just mentioned in these answers,\" Buttigieg said. \"Let me tell you, though, how this looks from the industrial Midwest where I live: Washington politicians, congressmen and senators saying all the right things, offering the most elegant policy prescriptions, and nothing changes.\" Polling shows that a wealth tax is more popular than Medicare for All and in some polls even gets more support than opposition from Republicans. Similar to Buttigieg, Klobuchar said she could support a wealth tax but added that she would rather repeal tax cuts for higher-income Americans passed under Trump. \"It could work. I am open to it. But I want to give a reality check here to Elizabeth, because no one on this stage wants to protect billionaires,\" she said. \"We just have different approaches. Your idea is not the only idea.\"",

            "article_content": "Wisconsin is a crucial state for Democrats to win back in the 2020 presidential election. Voters there share thoughts on the campaign in the wake of the third primary debate.  MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: Democrats squared off for their third presidential debate last night in Houston. So far in the 2020 primary contest, polling has indicated not just which candidates voters prefer, it also shows high levels of interest and engagement on the part of Democratic voters, which is exactly what NPR's Don Gonyea found at a watch party in Milwaukee in the very important electoral state of Wisconsin. DON GONYEA, BYLINE: As watch parties go, the setting was unusual. It was at a place called Bounce Milwaukee that has inflatable playscapes, rock climbing, ax throwing and a bar with lots of pinball machines. (SOUNDBITE OF PINBALL MACHINES) GONYEA: Owner Ryan Clancy did some modifications to one old Spider-Man machine. There's a plastic figurine under the glass right in the middle. RYAN CLANCY: We took out the normal villain, who's Sandman, and we put in Donald Trump. We changed a lot of the audio samples, as well. GONYEA: So as the ball ricochets around, Trump's voice reacts. (SOUNDBITE OF PINBALL MACHINE) COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE: (Imitating Donald Trump) Bing, bing. Bang, bang. Robbie, you are fake news. GONYEA: The pinball machines went silent when the debate came on. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: That we must and will defeat Trump. GONYEA: The booths in the upstairs bar filled quickly. More than 60 people showed up. Thirty-year-old Lorenzo Santos (ph) was there. He works as a sales manager. He says he feels compelled to be involved and informed. LORENZO SANTOS: I think it's exciting. It's definitely refreshing, and it's encouraging. I really do believe that these are uncommon times. GONYEA: But he also says the need to do something is rooted in worries about a repeat of last time in Wisconsin and nationally. SANTOS: After 2016, who knows anything about politics? GONYEA: This was a mostly younger crowd, voters in their 20s and 30s. Some, new to politics. Many, longtime Democratic activists, like Solana Patterson Ramos (ph). She was a Bernie Sanders supporter four years ago. This time, she's undecided. So far, she's pleased to have more progressives to choose from this year, and she likes that issues like race, gun violence and \"Medicare for All\" are being aired out on the debate stage. SOLANA PATTERSON RAMOS: So they're talking about helping with the college debt. They're talking about helping with college tuition, with poverty, in general. And then that's kind of where I'm going forward. GONYEA: She says that even if a moderate Democrat gets the nomination, her hope is that maybe they'll be just a bit more progressive than they would have been otherwise. Stacy Clark (ph) also describes himself as a progressive. He says his favorite candidate is Kamala Harris. But, he says, he likes and trusts Joe Biden and that he's leaning toward Biden right now. It's about how to best beat Donald Trump, he says. STACY CLARK: Let's try to bring it back slowly. The progressive ideas, of course, I agree with them. But how are we going to effectively make sure that America works for everyone? GONYEA: So there were strong disagreements on the debate stage and at this watch party. But here's something else that feels different this year. These Democratic voters are pretty quick to say they expect to support the eventual nominee, even at this early date when the debate stage is still crowded. Here's how Elizabeth Warren supporter Danny Hoeft (ph) put it. He's 22 and works at a Milwaukee law firm. DANNY HOEFT: When you talk with other people tonight, no one's going to be bashing candidates very hard because we realize that no matter who the candidate is, they're supporting middle-class Americans, and they're undoing what Trump has done in the past three years right now. GONYEA: But history also shows that finding party unity isn't always so easy. Elections in '08 and 2016 are only the most recent examples so that prediction may still be tested.

            "article_content": "For Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, all politics are personal. Her focus on the fragility of the middle class dates back to key moments in her own life.  AILSA CHANG, HOST: Massachusetts senator and presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren is known for her policy plans - plans on big issues like guns, trade, race relations. She talked about that when she sat down recently with the NPR Politics Podcast and Iowa Public Radio. But Warren also revealed some things from her personal life. NPR's Asma Khalid reports on how Warren's experiences have informed her politics and her plans. ASMA KHALID: Elizabeth Warren always wanted to be a teacher. So when she got a job as a professor at a law school back in the '70s, she was thrilled. She had two little kids and a career. ELIZABETH WARREN: And I'm doing it all. I'm - not well - in fact, pretty badly. I'm doing dinner slips until 8:30 at night, and baths aren't until 9:30. And I'm doing laundry at 11 o'clock, and I'm doing my class preps at midnight. And I'm just scratching to try to hold it all together. KHALID: Warren told us this story when we asked her to describe a moment in her life when she failed. Things got worse. One day, the babysitter quit. Then her aunt called. WARREN: And she said, how are you doing, sweetie? And I said, fine. And then I started to cry. And I told her, I'm going to quit my job. I just couldn't do this. I was failing my classes. I was failing my children. I was a failure. KHALID: Her aunt moved in, and Warren kept her job. It is no accident that one of the first policy proposals Warren put forth was an ambitious plan for universal affordable child care. Her politics are rooted in a central message - government works great for a thin slice at the top and works badly for everyone else. There's a story she often shares on the campaign trail - a moment from her childhood that has shaped how she sees government. Her dad had a heart attack and was out of work for a long time. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) WARREN: My mother, who was 50 years old and had never worked outside the home, pulled on her best dress and put on her high heels and walked to the Sears and got a minimum wage job. And that minimum wage job saved our home. And more importantly, it saved our family. KHALID: Warren says years later, she realized it wasn't just family folklore. It was a fundamental story about government. She says a minimum wage job used to keep a family of three afloat. Nowadays, it can't. At times in our conversation, Warren folds up her leg, sneaker on the chair and her hand on her knee. I asked her about her faith. And the senator, who once taught Sunday school in Texas, quotes Scripture. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) WARREN: Matthew 25 - for I was hungry, and you fed me. I was thirsty, and you gave me drink. I was in prison, and you visited me. It's not just about having a good heart. It's about getting up and doing what needs to be done. KHALID: After we ended the interview, I still had a burning question I had been wanting to ask her. Warren has this signature look. Everywhere she goes - on the stump, at a debate, in our interview - she wears a black top, black pants and a monochrome blazer or cardigan, usually in jewel tones. When we spoke, it was teal. So I asked her, is it intentional? And before y'all scream sexist, just take a listen. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) KHALID: I've been very intrigued by your fashion choices. You have the black camisole look, and it's a - like, a different colored blazer. WARREN: Yeah. KHALID: Is that a conscious decision... WARREN: Yep. KHALID: ...Or do you just - it's easy. Like, you don't... WARREN: Do you know how long it takes me to get dressed in the morning? KHALID: Yeah. WARREN: Four minutes. KHALID: Did you catch that? It takes her four minutes to get dressed. She says she's saving her decision-making capacity. The candidate who has a reputation for having plans for just about everything has even got a plan for how to efficiently get dressed in the morning. Asma Khalid, NPR News.

            "article_content": "The second night of the Democratic primary debates in Detroit will feature the frontrunner, former Vice President Joe Biden, who is expected to face challenges from Sens. Harris, Booker and others.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: It's night two for the Democrats, and a whole new cast of candidates will be onstage at their debate in Detroit. Last night was very much a battle of ideas. Progressives Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren were calling for sweeping policy changes on health care as more centrist candidates accused them of making impossible promises that will deliver Donald Trump a reelection victory. Here's how Warren responded to that. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ELIZABETH WARREN: You know, I don't understand why anybody goes to all the trouble of running for president of the United States just to talk about what we really can't do and shouldn't fight for. SHAPIRO: Tonight, the arguments may be very different. And to explain why, we are joined from Detroit by NPR lead political editor Domenico Montanaro and NPR political correspondent Asma Khalid. Hi, guys. DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Hey there. ASMA KHALID, BYLINE: Hey there. SHAPIRO: Let's start by taking stock of what happened last night, the first night of this debate. Domenico, what was your main takeaway? MONTANARO: Well, a real debate broke out. You know, we had a debate over health care and on immigration to maybe a lesser extent between this moderate wing of the Democratic Party and the more progressive wing. I mean, you had Senator Elizabeth Warren, who we heard there, center stage with Bernie Sanders. And coming into the debate, a lot of people wondered if maybe there'd be some distinctions drawn between the two of them. Guess what - not so much. They were both allies. And what they said after the debate - at least people within Sanders' campaign said that - don't expect them to criticize each other. There's six more months left of voting. And if the two of them are left standing, then maybe we'll see Sanders go after Elizabeth Warren. We also saw Steve Bullock, the governor of Montana, really be able to distinguish himself on the moderate wing. And it was the first time for him in the debate lineup, so that was key. SHAPIRO: OK, so let's turn to tonight because last month, the first night of the debate was practically forgotten after, on the second night, Senator Kamala Harris sparred with former Vice President Joe Biden over his civil rights record. They are next to each other once again at center stage tonight. So, Asma, what are you watching for? KHALID: I am looking for the degree to which Joe Biden can defend himself this time. You know, part of this - we should give the backstory - is because Joe Biden enjoys considerable support among African American voters. There is a sense from both California Senator Kamala Harris as well as New Jersey Senator Cory Booker, who will be on the other side of Biden, that they need to peel away some of that support from black voters in order to do well in this primary season. That is why they've been attacking Joe Biden. You know, I will say that over the last week or so, we've seen a real kind of public spat, particularly between Biden and Booker. Booker has been criticizing Biden for his record on criminal justice reform, saying that he was an architect of mass incarceration because of his support for the 1994 crime bill. Biden, of course, and his advisers disagree with this, and they've been going after Joe Biden's record. And I presume we'll hear more about criminal justice reform and racial justice issues tonight. SHAPIRO: So if Biden goes into this debate with a target on his back, how is he preparing to defend himself? MONTANARO: Well, what senior advisers said this afternoon was that he's going to go after Donald Trump. That's his first and principal thing that he's going to do. But he is prepared to attack back on other people's records. They said, look; if you're going to attack Vice President Biden's record, then guess what; the rest of the people on this stage - they have records, too, and be prepared to defend those things. And, as Asma pointed out, when it comes to black voters, Vice President Biden is still doing very well with African Americans. And what one adviser said is that if - that the reason that these other candidates are going after him is because he's got 51% of African American voters in a lot of polls, and they want it. KHALID: And, you know, one of the other things I think that's worth pointing out is that overall, you know, there will be a conversation tonight on health care because Joe Biden has been very critical of a \"Medicare for All\" system. Kamala Harris released a plan recently that is kind of a hybrid between Biden and Sanders; it's a Medicare for All plan with a limited role for insurance. But Joe Biden is already criticizing that. Here's what he had to say. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JOE BIDEN: Well, I find that people will say they're for Medicare for All but they're not going to tax the middle class because you don't need to do that. Come on. What is this? Is this a fantasy world here? SHAPIRO: That is the voice of Joe Biden, one of 10 candidates onstage tonight at the second night of the Democratic presidential debate in Detroit. NPR's Asma Khalid and Domenico Montanaro speaking with us from Detroit there. Thanks to both of you. KHALID: You're welcome. MONTANARO: Thanks a lot. Copyright \u00a9 2019 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders were at the center of a heated fight over \"Medicare for All.\" At the Democratic debate tonight, one particular aspect of Bernie Sanders' \"Medicare for All\" plan got special scrutiny. After a back-and-forth over how to pay for the plan, CNN moderator Jake Tapper pointedly asked Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who has sponsored Sanders' plan: \"Would you raise taxes on the middle class to pay for Medicare for All \u2014 offset, obviously, by the elimination of insurance premiums \u2014 yes or no?\" \"Costs will go up for billionaires and go up for corporations,\" Warren said. \"For middle-class families, costs \u2014 total costs \u2014 will go down.\" This exchange encapsulated one of the biggest arguments in tonight's debate over health care: whether candidates would raise taxes, and whether families' total health care bills would go up. Tapper went on to ask other candidates to weigh in on the same question on taxes. Sanders envisions that those taxes would be replacing other health spending. The broader question here is how much people would end up spending in total on health care. The answer to that is hard to determine. The bill as laid out right now isn't very specific on how revenues would be raised, as the Kaiser Family Foundation's Larry Levitt told NPR. \"What would happen to the middle class depends entirely on the details. Under the current Medicare for All proposals, middle-class people would have no premiums, deductibles or copays, and save a lot of money on health care,\" he said. \"Whether they would pay more or less on net would depend on which taxes go up to pay for the plan.\" When Sanders released his latest Medicare for All bill, he released a document called \"options to finance Medicare for All\" \u2014 a list of ways to potentially pay for parts of the bill. One potential tax Sanders listed that has been particularly controversial is a 4% \"income-based premium\" that households making more than $29,000 per year would pay. He also calls for taxes on employers and greater taxes on high-income households. Sanders argues that while, yes, his plan may end up taxing middle-class households more, the fact that they would no longer be paying premiums and copays would more than make up for whatever they might end up paying in taxes. If that 4% tax were imposed, it is indeed possible that some families could end up paying less. But that depends, for example, on the family and how much they spend on health care now. Not only that, but all of this depends on how much Sanders' plan costs and whether these taxes really would cover the entire cost of the plan. One 2016 report from the Urban Institute found that taxes proposed by Sanders wouldn't fully cover his Medicare for All plan at the time. That study also raised the question of knock-on effects of taxes on employers: on the one hand, the study pointed out, not paying premiums anymore could mean more compensation for some workers. On the other hand, new payroll taxes could mean reduced wages at some businesses. This debate over middle-class taxes is not particular to Sanders and Warren; Kamala Harris' new health plan, which she calls her version of Medicare for All, got attention this week in part because of her promise not to raise taxes for the \"middle class.\" In her plan, she said she would impose new taxes on families earning more than $100,000. Joe Biden swung back at that \u2014 his deputy campaign manager, Kate Bedingfield, in a statement said that Harris' plan represented \"a refusal to be straight with the American middle class,\" adding that they believed her plan would mean middle-class tax hikes. All of which is to say that this fight over middle-class taxes and health care overhauls could easily continue in Wednesday night's debate.",

Above, he attends the Fourth of July parade in Independence, Iowa. Before the first presidential debate last month, former Vice President Joe Biden's campaign signaled that he expected to be attacked by the candidates trailing him in the polls but that Biden would essentially ignore all incoming fire. It was a classic front-runner approach. And it was punctured, hard and fast, by California Sen. Kamala Harris' attack on Biden's past opposition to federal busing policies. From the moment Harris told Biden, seemingly out of the blue, that \"I do not believe you are a racist,\" Biden's candidacy suddenly looked much more vulnerable \u2014 even as he has maintained a lead in every poll \u2014 and Harris' campaign had the viral, news-grabbing moment that it had lacked up until that point. Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., and Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., speak at the 50th annual NAACP Image Awards in March in Los Angeles. The two leading African American candidates are expected to spar with Biden during this week's Democratic debate.\n                \n                    \n                    Chris Pizzello/Invision/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., and Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., speak at the 50th annual NAACP Image Awards in March in Los Angeles. The two leading African American candidates are expected to spar with Biden during this week's Democratic debate. In the wake of Harris' attack, Biden is changing course. \"I'm not going to be as polite this time,\" Biden told supporters at a fundraiser last week. It's clear he meant it. Biden and his top advisers spent much of the past week sparring with and criticizing Harris, as well as New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, the two candidates he will stand between on Wednesday night's debate stage in Detroit. Booker has campaigned on the idea of \"radical love\" and seems to be shifting more toward a strategy of tough love. He took a jab at Biden on Twitter, following the former vice president's release of a criminal justice reform plan. It\u2019s not enough to tell us what you\u2019re going to do for our communities, show us what you\u2019ve done for the last 40 years. You created this system. We\u2019ll dismantle it. He described Biden as an \"architect of mass incarceration,\" when speaking with reporters last week at the annual NAACP convention in Detroit. Booker was referring to Biden's role as a champion of the controversial 1994 crime bill, which critics and some experts say led to a disproportionate number of African American men being imprisoned. \"I'm disappointed that it's taken Joe Biden years until he was actually running for president to actually say that he made a mistake, that there were things in that bill that were extraordinarily bad,\" Booker said. \"For him not to have a more comprehensive, bold plan to deal with this is unacceptable to me, especially because he is partially responsible for the crisis that we have now.\" Biden's campaign fired back in a rare on-the-record response. Kate Bedingfield, Biden's deputy campaign manager, pointed to Booker's tenure as mayor of Newark and his \"zero tolerance\" on crime. \"Booker was running a police department that was such a civil rights nightmare that the U.S. Department of Justice intervened,\" she said in a statement. The feds did launch an investigation into the Newark Police Department while Booker was mayor and found vastly disproportionate numbers of pedestrian stops and arrests of black residents, as well as unreasonable use of force. Booker welcomed the inquiry when it was launched. \"I'm pretty relieved and enthusiastic about working with the Department of Justice,\" Booker said at the time, according to the Star-Ledger. Biden himself also questioned Booker's record, when speaking with reporters in Michigan last week. \"His police department was stopping and frisking people, mostly African American men,\" he said. In that same conversation, the former vice president also made an indirect jab at Harris. He questioned how any candidate could promise \"Medicare-for-all\" and pay for it without a tax hike on the middle class. \"Come on! What is this? Is this a fantasy world here?\" he said. The Biden-Harris and Biden-Booker sniping \u2014 the most direct and sustained of the primary so far \u2014 could be a preview of arguments we hear in the next debate. It also underscores the importance of black voters in the Democratic primary; it's impossible for any Democrat to clinch the nomination without gaining substantial support from African American voters. Black voters make up at least 10% of the Democratic electorate in more than half a dozen states voting on Super Tuesday, which in 2020 will fall on March 3, just a month after the primaries begin. In some states, such as Alabama, more than 50% of Democratic voters are black. Last week, at the National Urban League conference in Indianapolis, Booker did not criticize Biden by name onstage, but he challenged the notion of \"electability\" and insisted that when people talk about this concept, they're not asking African American voters what they want. After Booker made his remarks, Bedingfield tweeted poll results showing Biden with far more support than Booker among black voters. We couldn\u2019t agree more! https://t.co/hqBDy0ZDRq pic.twitter.com/T9RaeUkPDI Another poll in the last week showed Biden maintaining a wide lead over Harris and other candidates in South Carolina \u2014 a state that Harris, in particular, views as critical to her path to the nomination. While Biden appears eager to defend himself against attacks, rival campaigns have warned that an overly confrontational approach, especially against two younger black candidates, could cut into a key aspect of his campaign \u2014 that Biden would restore more dignity and normalcy to the White House after four years of endless feuding and Twitter attacks from President Trump. The Biden campaign dismisses that argument. \"The notion he would sit back and let others mischaracterize and tear down his record is silly,\" a Biden adviser said. \"Everyone is looking for their T-shirt moment,\" the adviser added, referencing the merchandise that the Harris campaign began selling the night of the first debate, \"and Joe Biden thinks this is bigger than selling T-shirts.\"",

Bernie Sanders of Vermont speaks about his \"Medicare for All\" proposal on Wednesday at George Washington University. Hoping to regain momentum as two rival candidates creep closer in the polls, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders returned to his signature policy theme in a major speech Wednesday: a single-payer, \"Medicare for All\" health insurance system. \"The time is now to go forward. The time is now to expand Medicare to every man, woman, and child in this country,\" Sanders told supporters and reporters in Washington, D.C. Sanders outlined in broad strokes how he'd implement Medicare for All: He'd lower the eligibility age from 65 to 55 in the first year of the new program, then to 45, then 35, then eventually to every adult. Children, Sanders said, would be eligible for the insurance program in the first year of the transition. Sanders also said he also wants to expand Medicare beyond its current benefits to include dental coverage as well. \"The desire to have teeth in your mouth is a health care issue,\" he said. Sanders argues that universal, government-run health care would lower medical costs and eliminate insurance premiums, deductibles, and payments \u2014 but he also acknowledged his proposal would require tax increases. Sanders mocked the idea of families celebrating the status-quo insurance costs that he has pledged to eliminate. \"Oh my God, dear, the insurance premium is here, what a wonderful day,\" he said. \"Oh wow, let's celebrate.\" The costs for a program like the one Sanders has outlined long have been a sticking point. Two years ago, California legislative analysts put the price tag of a potential single-payer health care system at $400 billion for California alone. The bill in question died in California's Assembly, which is overwhelmingly Democratic. Striving to stand out The speech comes at a time when Sanders is facing increasing pressure from other Democrats in the top tier of polling and fundraising: most notably, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and California Sen. Kamala Harris. While Sanders had long registered far above any other candidate but former Vice President Joe Biden, Harris and Warren have gained substantial ground in recent weeks. Warren has narrowly jumped past Sanders into second place, behind Biden, in a handful of surveys, and raised more money than Sanders from individual contributions in the last quarter. Sanders' campaign leaders say they're aware of the shifting dynamics but they're not panicking. \"I think it's more of the case that other people are gaining some attention and traction. They are new candidates in the race, and that is a credit to them,\" said campaign manager Faiz Shakir. \"They're fresher to the scene for that reason, so you're seeing other candidates get a little more support, which is good. It's healthy. It's fine.\" Still, Sanders has been reluctant to criticize Warren, Harris and other candidates who have embraced large planks from his progressive platform, even as he competes with them for support. \"Elizabeth [Warren] is a longtime friend of mine, she is a very good senator,\" Sanders recently told NPR. \"Elizabeth's running her campaign. I'm running my campaign.\" The hesitance is especially notable since Harris has repeatedly vacillated on her support for a core aspect of the Sanders Medicare for All plan she has co-sponsored in the Senate: the complete elimination of private health insurance, outside of supplementary plans. In a CNN interview this week, Harris said it would likely take more than four years to fully transition from the current health care system to Medicare for All. Harris also argued that preserving private health insurance ensures more coverage for more Americans without raising taxes on the middle class. Sanders has acknowledged his health care proposals would require higher taxes \u2014 but argues it would also lower medical bills and eliminated insurance costs, making the increase worth it. And while Warren laid out several detailed policy plans during the initial months of her presidential campaign, she too did not unequivocally back the full elimination of private health insurance until last month's debate. Instead of pointing out those inconsistencies to progressives who may be migrating to support for Harris and Warren, Sanders has focused his fire on Biden, attacking what Sanders rejects as a \"middle ground\" approach to politics. Biden's less radical outlook In the days since Biden unveiled a health care plan centered around the existing Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, and creating a public option government insurance plan, Sanders and his campaign have gone as far as comparing Biden's view on health care to President Trump's. Earlier this week, Sanders' camp sent an email to reporters warning that an Obamacare-centered health insurance plan \"leaves nearly 10 million people uninsured,\" and \"leaves people at the whims of their employers.\" That's despite the fact that Sanders helped lead the effort to save the Affordable Care Act in 2017 and 2018, when Republican majorities in the House and Senate tried and failed to repeal Obamacare. \"The Affordable Care Act took us a step forward,\" Sanders told NPR in 2017, even as he advocated for an eventual shift to a single-payer system. \"It provided health insurance for over 20 million more Americans. That's no small thing. It did away with the obscenity of preexisting conditions and a number of other essential health care benefits that are now guaranteed to the American people. So it made some real change.\" For his part, Biden has framed Medicare for All as a \"risky\" elimination of an Affordable Care Act that he argues is already here and working. \"I knew Republicans would do everything in their power to repeal Obamacare. They still are. But I'm surprised that so many Democrats are running on getting rid of it,\" Biden said in a campaign video posted this week. \"I understand the appeal of Medicare for All,\" Biden said. \"But folks supporting it should be clear that it means getting rid of Obamacare, and I'm not for that.\"",

That's far more income than the other major Democratic candidates, and it came mostly from the release of his book Promise Me, Dad. Former Vice President Joe Biden has referred to himself as \"middle class Joe\" throughout his political career, and used to regularly joke about being the \"poorest person on Congress.\" Those terms no longer apply. Biden and his wife, Jill, have together earned more than $15 million since Biden left office. That's according to tax returns and other financial disclosure forms released by Biden's campaign on Tuesday. The bulk of the Bidens' earnings come from book sales and paid speaking engagements \u2013 two routine sources of income for former high-ranking public officials. The documents show Biden has earned far more than the rest of the 2020 presidential field, with the likely exception of billionaire Tom Steyer, who entered the race Tuesday. The Bidens' adjusted gross income for 2018 was $4.5 million. It was even higher \u2014 $11 million \u2013 in 2017. They have paid a federal tax rate of just over 33% each year. By comparison, Vermont. Sen Bernie Sanders earned $561,293 last year, California Sen. Kamala Harris reported $1,884,319. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren took in $846,394, and South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg reported $152,643. Presidential candidates typically don't release their tax returns until they've become their party's nominee. President Trump broke tradition and refused to make his tax returns public. As Democrats have continued to make that a political issue, the majority of the 2020 field have made their own financial information public. Biden's campaign points out that he's now disclosed the last 21 years of tax returns, including disclosures during his 2008 run and time as vice president. Biden's itemized financial disclosure shows that his income came mostly from his book Promise Me, Dad about his late son Beau Biden and the book tour that accompanied its release. He also made over $2 million from other paid speaking engagements, an average of over $127,000 per event. Event companies, universities, and community groups were among those who provided for Biden's paid speeches, but not major corporations or industry groups. The Bidens gave $275,896 to charity last year. The rate \u2013 about six percent of their overall income \u2013 was higher than any other candidate except Warren, who also donated about the same percentage of her income.

Heading into the 2020 campaign, Democratic candidates are trying to find arguments against him on the economy, which is doing well according to top-line indicators. At the Democratic presidential debate this week, voters got a preview of how Democrats will handle what for now is an uphill battle against President Trump. That challenging hill is the economy, because it's doing well right now, at least by the headline numbers. Unemployment is at 3.6 percent, the lowest it's been in about 50 years, and growth is still moving at a good clip. Consumer confidence is generally high (despite a recent slip). On top of that, one key point: despite Trump's approval rating being stuck in the mid-40s, he tends to do better on the economy. All that could make Trump's path to another term much easier. So Democrats are trying to thread a tricky needle: telling voters that while the economy is doing well, it is doing disproportionately well for the rich. In other words: the current good economy should be benefiting all of you more. The economy is doing okay... so what to improve? There's evidence that the economy particularly bears on voters' choices. Yale economist Ray Fair has a relatively well-known model for predicting the popular vote based on economic indicators. His latest prediction, as of April: that the Democratic nominee will get 45 percent of the popular vote. All of which is to say that if the economy is still doing well next year, Democrats may have to figure out how to tell people how things could be even better. That's where the \"the economy isn't working for everyone\" idea comes in. It's an idea that got a lot of play during the two debates. It's of course been at the core of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders' stump speech for years. It's a huge part of Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren's campaign message, which she brought out on Wednesday night: \"I think of it this way: Who is this economy really working for? It's doing great for a thinner and thinner slice at the top.\" Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren argued that the economy under President Trump is \"doing great for a thinner and thinner slice at the top\" at this week's Democratic primary debate.\n                \n                    \n                    Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren argued that the economy under President Trump is \"doing great for a thinner and thinner slice at the top\" at this week's Democratic primary debate. California Sen. Kamala Harris echoed this sentiment: \"This president walks around talking about and flouting his great economy, right? My great economy. My great economy. You ask him, well, how are you measuring this greatness of this economy of yours and he talks about the stock market. Well, that's fine if you own stocks. So many families in America do not.\" And that's just two candidates. A range of others this week \u2014 Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke, entrepreneur Andrew Yang, to name several \u2014 made similar arguments. One challenge they face is connecting with voters on this idea \u2014 that the economy is fundamentally broken and in need of structural change. One political problem with that argument is that it doesn't have a distinct villain \u2014 just the \"1 percent\" of richest Americans or corporations. Thus far, the candidates seem to have found two ways to address that problem, and one is the Trump tax cuts. Harris took aim at these at the debate, stressing that the Republican tax bill \"benefits the top 1 percent and the biggest corporations in America.\" New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand and Sanders likewise made similar arguments. It's a line of attack that seizes on a concrete policy that \u2014 at least, as of tax day 2019 \u2014 was broadly unpopular. So it's easy to see this being a key line of attack for a Democratic nominee in 2020. Once again, though, it's easy to see how the argument that the rich are doing too well might not move voters who themselves feel more or less fine about the economy. Another line of attack Democrats took in the debates was to connect the economy to particular topic areas, like health care. When it comes to their personal finances, Americans list health care costs as their top concern, according to Gallup. It's perhaps no coincidence, then, that multiple times, when candidates brought up the economy, they tied it to that issue. Especially given that health care was key to Democratic victories in 2018, this could be a particularly attractive tactic for a Democratic nominee. Democratic presidential candidates Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Sen. Kamala Harris of California both argued that the economy is not working well for average Americans on stage Thursday at the Democratic presidential debate.\n                \n                    \n                    Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Democratic presidential candidates Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Sen. Kamala Harris of California both argued that the economy is not working well for average Americans on stage Thursday at the Democratic presidential debate. The potential hurdles for Trump Whether or not it affects people's votes, candidates aren't wrong when they say Americans are not sharing equally in a strong economy. One 2017 study showed what many Americans might already intuit: that economic growth just doesn't benefit lower and middle-class Americans the way it used to. Another way to get at this: The labor share of GDP \u2014 the share of economic output that goes to workers in their paychecks (or benefits) \u2014 has fallen precipitously in recent decades. So Democrats have good data they can point to. If a nominee can somehow connect to voters on an emotional level on that idea, it's possible they could win some over. In addition, despite a generally strong economy, Trump faces a couple of other challenges: One is that his approval (as we said earlier) is still pretty low \u2014 and he has only experienced a good economy as president. He could take a hit if the economy tanks. And the economy very well could turn bad before Election Day 2020. A recent survey from a panel of business economists found a jump in recession fears for 2020 \u2014 right now, those economists say there's a 60 percent chance of a recession by the end of next year. In the next year and a half, then, a Democratic message on the economy could change dramatically. But for now, Democrats must wrestle with the tough question of how to sell a new economic message when things look relatively okay.",

Elizabeth Warren participates in a re-enacted swearing-in with U.S. Vice President Joe Biden at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 3, 2013. In 2005, bankruptcy was on the rise and had been for years. Lawmakers were pondering why, exactly, that was happening \u2014 and what, if anything, they should do about it \u2014 when two future presidential rivals squared off over a bankruptcy overhaul bill that would restrict who could write off their personal debts. In one corner, Joe Biden \u2014 one of the staunchest Democratic advocates for the bill and a senator from Delaware, home to several large credit card companies. He was also a member of the Judiciary Committee, which was debating the bill. In the other corner, Elizabeth Warren, a Harvard Law professor who had fought against this type of bankruptcy overhaul for years and who was on a panel convened for a hearing over the bill. Their conversation started off with a testy (but weedy) exchange about bankruptcy courts. And it escalated from there, with plenty of interruptions and the occasional barb \u2014 Biden at one point cast Warren's arguments as \"mildly demagogic.\" It ended with a tense dispute over what, exactly, the dispute ought to be. WARREN: [Credit card companies] have squeezed enough out of these families in interest and fees and payments that never pay down principle. BIDEN: Maybe should talk about usury rates. That maybe, that's what we should be talking about, not bankruptcy. WARREN: Senator, I'll be the first. Invite me. BIDEN: Now, I know you will, but let's call a spade a spade. Your problem with the credit-card companies is usury rates, from your position. It's not about the bankruptcy bill. WARREN: But Senator, if you're not going to fix that problem, you can't take away the last shred of protection for these families. BIDEN: OK, I get it. [pause] You're very good, Professor. It was heated debate with a polite, even charming end \u2014 complete with laughter throughout the hearing room, but the stakes are higher now, with both Warren and Biden potentially poised to share a debate stage. And while debate over a 14-year-old bankruptcy bill might otherwise be largely forgotten by now, the 2020 presidential election has made the disagreements between Biden and Warren relevant again \u2014 and shows how their exchange over that 2005 bill show up in their current presidential campaign strategies. With Democrats in the minority in the Senate in 2005, Biden argues he was trying to make a Republican bill better. Warren thought, even then, that it was fundamentally flawed and bad for consumers. What the bill did A major question at the heart of the 2005 bankruptcy bill was why bankruptcies were on the rise. One side \u2014 including Warren and many Democrats \u2014 said it was because people were financially strapped because of major obligations like medical debt, and that credit card companies were exacerbating the problem. Others \u2014 largely Republicans, but also some Democrats, like Biden \u2014 said that it was a combination of irresponsible spending and a system that made it too easy to apply for bankruptcy, leading to abuse. That abuse, these lawmakers argued, leads to higher costs for other people seeking credit. Loading... The 2005 bill restricted who could discharge their debts via Chapter 7 bankruptcy and also made the process more difficult. It included a means test, in the form of comparing a person's income with their state's median income. The goal, proponents argued, was to make sure that people who could still pay their debts weren't able to unfairly escape their debts, while also ensuring that people who couldn't pay were able to get relief. The bill also said that a person had to go through credit counseling before obtaining bankruptcy. Opponents, however, cast bankruptcy as an important financial protection that the legal system provides to people in difficult circumstances. They thought that the bill would make it unduly hard to file, enriching credit card companies in the process. And indeed, as they argued, credit card companies themselves had lobbied for it. Warren and her fellow opponents also argued that bankruptcy was a women's issue, as single and divorced women were disproportionately represented among bankruptcy filers. Passing this type of reform would therefore disproportionately hurt women and children, they said (an argument that Warren pointedly made in a 2002 Harvard Women's Law Review essay that focuses heavily on Biden). A long runup This was not new legislation. Similar bills had been proposed in Congress several times \u2014 it even reached the Oval Office in the final days of Bill Clinton's presidency, but he declined to sign it. Biden and Warren had been on opposite sides during that period, as well \u2014 Biden voted for that 2000 bill, and Warren had counseled Hillary Clinton that it would be bad for consumers. And that was the lay of the land when they met on Capitol Hill. \"This is one of those situations where the current story is not misleading. They were both very key players in this,\" said David Skeel, professor at the University of Pennsylvania law school and the author of a history of bankruptcy. \"Elizabeth Warren was the most important critic of the legislation, and she spent years fighting it. That's what really first got her into the into the public eye,\" he said. \"And Joe Biden was critically important to passing the legislation because credit card companies are very important to Delaware. And that's where he was coming from.\" In the end, the bill passed. And as for the effects, they're complicated. One outcome: The bill included a provision that made obligations like child support and alimony a top priority for debtors to pay off \u2014 which addressed one  concern of the bill's opponents. And another, overarching result: Bankruptcies fell sharply afterward. And that's linked to one other effect of the bill, according to Skeel. \"The biggest effect is that it is now more expensive to file for bankruptcy than it used to be,\" Skeel said, \"because of the the so-called means test that was put into the 2005 amendments that requires that debtors fill out forms to determine whether they would be capable of repaying some of what they owe.\" But, crucially, it's not totally clear that that shows a reduction in bankruptcy abuse, he added. Research on the bill also doesn't hand either side a total win. On the one hand, the reform was associated with lower interest rates on credit cards, as Vox's Matthew Yglesias pointed out in an article on the Warren-Biden debate. But, Yglesias argued, studies also suggested that the law meant less access to credit and lower credit scores for some borrowers, not to mention a potentially slower bounce back from the Great Recession. The political fallout Potential 2020 voters have already had a preview of Warren's attacks on Biden. In 2016, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., attacked Hillary Clinton's vote for a similar 2001 bankruptcy bill \u2014 a vote she took after Warren convinced her it was a bad bill. Sanders used Warren's criticisms as part of his attacks. Warren talked about her disappointment in a 2004 interview with journalist Bill Moyers: WARREN: She voted in favor of it. MOYERS: Why? WARREN: As Sen. Clinton, the pressures are very different. It's a well-financed industry. You know, a lot of people don't realize that the industry that gave the most money to Washington over the past few years was not the oil industry. It was not pharmaceuticals. It was consumer credit products. Credit card companies have been giving money, and they have influence. MOYERS: And Mrs. Clinton was one of them as senator. WARREN: She has taken money from the groups, and more to the point, she worries about them as a constituency. For her part, Clinton argued that she was able to support the bill because it, at that point, included better protections for women seeking child support and alimony. That whole dynamic surrounding the law is repeating itself in this election. \"If you talk to many independent voters, they worry that both parties are funded by the same corporate interests,\" said Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which has endorsed Warren ahead of 2020. \"Elizabeth Warren has been part of the solution trying to re-brand the Democratic Party as being of the people. The credit card fight was just one chapter of that ongoing struggle.\" While Warren uses the fight as evidence of her willingness to fight corporations on behalf of everyday Americans, Biden and his supporters frame the bankruptcy bill as evidence of his practicality \u2014 and they also emphasize protections in the bill like those prioritizing child support. \"Sen. Biden, knowing essentially that the bill was likely to make it through a Republican-led Congress to a Republican-controlled White House, really worked hard to make sure that bill protected middle-class families,\" said Terrell McSweeny, who worked as a Biden staffer just after the bill's passage. And that plays into a larger narrative from the Biden campaign. \"Folks, I'm going to say something outrageous,\" he has said. \"I know how to make government work. Not because I've talked or tweeted about it, but because I've done it. I've worked across the aisle to reach consensus, to help make government work in the past.\" Democratic voters are concerned with far different topics than the bankruptcy bill, like climate change and a health care overhaul. But then, if both candidates remain key contenders for the nomination \u2014 and if they share a debate stage \u2014 there's a good chance the topic will come up again, as a symbol of the differences between the two candidates. And while bankruptcy expert Skeel acknowledges that he's not a political strategist, he does have one political prediction based on the Biden-Warren bankruptcy fight. \"It strikes me that one potential implication,\" he said, \"is it's highly unlikely you will see a Democratic ticket with both of them on it.\"",

Ahead of Tuesday's election, Netanyahu has pledged to annex Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said that he will annex Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank if he is re-elected. Netanyahu staked out the position on television on Saturday, ahead of Tuesday's election where he faces a challenge from his former army chief of staff Benny Gantz The first-time move from the prime minister appears to be aimed at galvanizing support among his nationalist base and right-wing political allies. The annexation of parts of the West Bank would likely be considered the final blow to the possibility of a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Netanyahu was asked on Israeli Channel 12 TV why he hasn't annexed Israeli settlement blocs in occupied territory, as NPR's Daniel Estrin reports from Jerusalem. The prime minister replied: \"Will we go to the next phase? The answer is yes. We will go to the next phase to extend Israeli sovereignty.\" \"I will impose sovereignty, but I will not distinguish between settlement blocs and isolated settlements,\" he continued, The Associated Press reports. \"From my perspective, any point of settlement is Israeli, and we have responsibility, as the Israeli government. I will not uproot anyone, and I will not transfer sovereignty to the Palestinians.\" On Sunday, Palestinian Foreign Minister Riad Malki responded to that pledge and accused the U.S. of encouraging Netanyahu. \"If Netanyahu wants to declare Israeli sovereignty over the West Bank, then you know he has to face a real problem, the presence of 4.5 million Palestinians, what to do with them,\" Malki told the AP while attending the World Economic forum in Jordan, apparently citing the combined total of Palestinians living in the occupied West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip. He said Israel cannot expel the Palestinians, adding, \"The international community has to deal with us.\" Netanyahu has actively supported the growth of Israeli settlements in the West Bank, which Israel has occupied since the Six-Day War in 1967. But Israel has so far stopped short of formally annexing the West Bank, leaving the door open for further negotiations with Palestinians. Some 400,000 Israeli settlers and 2.8 million Palestinians now live in in the West Bank. The Israeli settlements \u2013 which include large subdivisions and cities full of middle-class villas \u2013 have long complicated efforts for a two-state solution: Palestinians have said the settlements would make it impossible to create a viable state in the West Bank, as NPR's Greg Myre has reported. Another 200,000 Israelis live in East Jerusalem, part of the West Bank that Israel annexed shortly after the 1967 war. Saeb Erekat, chief negotiator for the Palestine Liberation Organization, criticized Netanyahu's statement on Saturday. \"Such a statement by Netanyahu is not surprising,\" Erekat wrote on Twitter. \"Israel will continue to brazenly violate international law for as long as the international community will continue to reward Israel with impunity, particularly with the Trump Administration's support and endorsement of Israel's violation of the national and human rights of the people of Palestine.\" Netanyahu's political campaign has emphasized his close ties with President Trump, Estrin reports. In his prime time interview on Saturday, Netanyahu portrayed those moves of support from the Trump administration as his own achievements, the AP reports. Last month, Trump recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, which Israel seized from Syria in 1967. In his first year in office, Trump had also recognized Jerusalem \u2014 the disputed city claimed as capital by both Israeli and Palestinian people \u2014 as Israel's capital, breaking with decades of U.S. foreign policy. Polls indicate a close race, though Netanyahu's Likud Party and its traditional allies, smaller right-wing parties, are predicted to win a slight majority of the votes. That gives Netanyahu the edge on forming a ruling coalition over Gantz's Blue and White political alliance \u2013 unless some right-wing parties choose to side with Gantz, Estrin reports. Gantz has accused Netanyahu of inciting against Israel's Palestinian Arab citizens and embracing extremists by allying with the far-right Jewish Power Party.",

            "article_content": "No matter who wins, a black woman will make history by succeeding Rahm Emanuel as mayor of Chicago in Tuesday's election.  AILSA CHANG, HOST: Tomorrow brings a watershed moment in Chicago politics. Voters will elect the city's first black female mayor. That description fits both candidates in the race, and both candidates say they have the background and skills to fix Chicago's persistent problems. From member station WBEZ, Natalie Moore has more. NATALIE MOORE, BYLINE: Mayor Rahm Emanuel stunned political circles when he announced last fall that he wouldn't seek re-election to a third term. Underneath the veneer of a sparkling downtown, Chicago is coping with an array of challenges - ratio and equity, police accountability, declining school enrollment, pension payouts, a shrinking middle class and, of course, the unrelenting gun violence. At one point, more than 20 candidates fought to get on the ballot. Now, two black women are left standing after February's nonpartisan primary. Lori Lightfoot is the former head of the Chicago Police Board. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LORI LIGHTFOOT: Not every day that a little black girl in a low-income family from a segregated steel town makes the runoff to be the next mayor of the third-largest city in the country. MOORE: Toni Preckwinkle is her challenger and is president of the Cook County Board. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TONI PRECKWINKLE: When I say I will fight for working families, you know I will because I've done it. I've built affordable housing, expanded access to health care. MOORE: Neither woman won the black vote in the primary. Barbara Ransby teaches history at the University of Illinois at Chicago. She says this election marks the defeat of a certain aspect of racist political culture in the city, specifically the opposition that Harold Washington endured when he became the first black mayor in 1983. BARBARA RANSBY: That said, in the 21st century, in the era of the movement for black lives, that's not enough. Activists and voters are really asking the questions, what does Toni Preckwinkle stand for? What does Lori Lightfoot stand for? MOORE: Lightfoot faces scrutiny as a corporate lawyer who some say hasn't done enough to hold police accountable. Preckwinkle is a career politician, and her critics say she's beholden to the Democratic machine here. In their campaigns, each candidate accuses the other of being entrenched in the system. RANSBY: Each of them are leaning toward a progressive representation of themselves - gives us an opening to say, make that real. Let me see what that means. And I think that's what activists will be doing. MOORE: Ransby and others say voters want answers about decades of neighborhood disinvestment. Both campaigns emphasize affordable housing, more community development spending and getting rid of a system where the mayor appoints school board members. If Lightfoot wins, she would also become Chicago's first openly gay mayor. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Five, six, seven - right here. MOORE: At a big, modern community center on Chicago's South Side, a couple of dozen black women are in the gym listening to instructions. They are in a line dancing class for seniors, learning the Mississippi hustle. Voter Morgan Reeves is retired from the city's public transit agency, where she ran the train yard, a rare position for a woman. She's excited about these two candidates and knows what they're up against. MORGAN REEVES: Being in a male-dominated field, you'd always get the looks like, why are you here, or, do you know what you're doing? You're constantly proving yourself, for one because you're a woman, and then a black woman at that. MOORE: Reeves says she sees a freshness and new possibilities with a black female mayor in city hall. After election day, Chicago will be the largest city in the country with that distinction.

Looking out over a crowd of firefighters chanting, \"Run, Joe, run,\" former Vice President Joe Biden urged patience. \"Save it a little longer; I may need it in a few weeks,\" he said, adding, \"Be careful what you wish for.\" Biden isn't officially running for president \u2014 at least not yet \u2014 but Tuesday's speech to the International Association of Fire Fighter's annual conference blocks from Capitol Hill served as the latest warmup act to a potential 2020 campaign. While Biden spent most of his speech talking to the firefighters about core union issues such as the importance of collective bargaining and the funding of health care and pensions, the former vice president did sprinkle his speech with several messages that could serve as the core of a presidential stump speech. \"Today we seem to be at each other's throats. Extremism is on the rise in this country,\" Biden said. \"Mean pettiness has overtaken our politics.\" The globe-trotting politician \u2014 who held a post on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for years before heading to the White House \u2014 spoke about the importance of America's role as a world leader, warning that other countries would fill that role instead if the country continues to shrink away from global alliances. Biden also blasted the Trump administration's recent budget proposal. \"It cuts $845 billion \u2014 almost a trillion-dollar cut in Medicare,\" Biden said. \"Why? Because of a tax cut for the super wealthy ... and now they've got to go make somebody pay for it.\" \"They gave millionaires and billionaires excessive tax breaks. And who are they asking to pay for it? Middle-class families like you.\" In a clear contrast to President Trump's divisive approach to politics, Biden framed his argument as one meant to reach out to every American. \"We can't be defined \u2014 we're not able to be defined \u2014 by race, by religion, by tribe. We're defined by those enduring principles that are in the Constitution,\" Biden said. \"That in America, everybody gets a shot. That's what the next president of the United States needs to understand, and that's what I don't think this current president understands at all.\" But as Biden workshops a message of inclusivity, the fact remains that if he enters the race, the former vice president will be a 76-year-old white man running in the most diverse field of candidates in presidential history. Democratic hopefuls such as California Sen. Kamala Harris, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker and others have made a point to highlight racial injustices in policing and economic policies, and have made sure they regularly speak to and about minority communities. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders veered from his usual stump speech during his first wave of campaign rallies, in order to speak about racism and the civil rights protests he attended in the 1960s. Biden's speech on Tuesday was delivered to an overwhelmingly male and white audience, and he did not specifically address racial inequality. If he does run, Biden will need to navigate the Democratic Party's increased emphasis on identity politics, as well as the politics of an increasingly energized progressive base that isn't particularly interested in the kinds of bipartisan legislative compromises he spent his career crafting. Biden briefly took on his party's leftward drift Tuesday, bemoaning the fact that \"if you've noticed, I get criticized for saying anything nice about a Republican. Folks, that's not who we are.\" At the moment, Biden remains on top of early Democratic polls. The key question: whether Biden's showing in these early polls is a sign of strength, or just the byproduct of name recognition. Jumping into the presidential campaign is the only way for Biden to answer that question.",

Kamala Harris, D-Calif., speaks at Vote For Justice: An Evening of Empowerment with activists and artists at the Newseum in Washington, D.C., in May 2018. Updated at 9:10 a.m. ET California Sen. Kamala Harris is running for president in 2020. The first-term Democratic senator made the announcement on ABC's Good Morning America Monday morning. \"I love my country, and this is a moment in time that I feel a sense of responsibility to fight for the best of who we are,\" Harris said. The 54-year-old Harris has been seen as a rising star in the Democratic Party even before she won a Senate seat in 2016. She received national attention as San Francisco district attorney before being elected California attorney general in 2010. Her campaign is highlighting that career, citing her experience on issues like sexual assault, housing and college affordability. Some of her proposals include middle-class tax cuts, rent relief, immigration and criminal justice overhauls, and Medicare for all. Harris's background in law enforcement could be a challenge in a Democratic primary, and she was asked on ABC about comments criticizing opposition to law enforcement on the left. \"I think it is a false choice to suggest that communities do not want law enforcement,\" Harris said. \"Most communities do. They don't want excessive force. They don't want racial profiling, but then nobody should.\" Harris is biracial \u2014 her parents were immigrants from Jamaica and India \u2014 making her only the second black woman and first South Asian-American person ever to serve in the Senate. One of just three black current senators, Harris plans to embrace that background in what is likely to be a large and diverse Democratic primary field. Announcing her run on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Harris' campaign says that is intended to highlight \"a reminder of the aspirational fight for progress that marked Harris' upbringing and that guides her today.\" She has modeled her campaign logo on graphics used by the late Rep. Shirley Chisholm, the first black woman to run for president. Harris spoke of her parents' involvement in the civil rights movement on Monday. \"That's the language that I grew up hearing, and it was about a belief that we are a country that was founded on noble ideals. And we are the best of who we are when we fight to achieve those ideals,\" Harris said. After arriving in the Senate in 2017, Harris quickly leveraged her seat on two high-profile Senate committees to become a national figure. Tapping into her prosecutorial background, Harris grilled Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein in nationally televised intelligence committee hearings in 2017, then did the same last fall when the Senate Judiciary Committee questioned Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh amid allegations of sexual misconduct. A recent NPR/PBS Newshour/Marist Poll found that a majority of Americans \u2014 54 percent \u2014 have not yet formed an opinion of Harris. But those who have a positive opinion of the California Democrat outnumbered those with a negative opinion by more than 3 to 1. Harris's announcement comes about a week after New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand kicked off her own presidential campaign, and three weeks after Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren became the first high-profile Democrat to launch a 2020 White House run. Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro formally declared a presidential run last week, as well, and several other Democrats have announced or indicated they will run, too. Unlike Warren, Gillibrand or Castro, Harris is not initially forming a presidential exploratory committee but instead immediately launching a full-scale presidential campaign. Harris has done little to hide her presidential ambitions. She traveled extensively for candidates during the 2018 midterm elections and made a stop in Iowa, which holds its caucuses before any other state holds primary contests. In the weeks leading up to her announcement, Harris made multiple high-profile media appearances promoting a recently released memoir. \"There's an incredible amount of change that has happened in a relatively short period of time, and it has understandably had a lot of people feeling displaced, wondering and asking a question about where do they fit in, their relevance, are they obsolete,\" said Harris in an interview with NPR's Morning Edition earlier this month. \"And [Trump] read it accurately. And then he took it to the lowest common denominator. [He said] it is us versus them instead of what real leadership would be about \u2014 which is to read it and say, 'Hey everybody, We're all in this together.' \" Harris will hold her first campaign rally next weekend in Oakland, Calif. \u2014 the city where she was born and held her first job as a prosecutor. Despite that connection, Harris will actually headquarter her campaign in Baltimore, a location that will allow her staff to be better positioned to travel to early-primary states as well as work in a news cycle driven by the Eastern time zone. (The campaign will maintain a second office in Oakland, as well.)",

            "article_content": "Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., took her economic message to Iowa during her first campaign trip since announcing her exploratory committee for a presidential bid in December.  LEILA FADEL, HOST: Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren is kicking off her presidential run this weekend with a swing through the early voting state of Iowa. Warren is the first major candidate to visit the state this political season. But she's just one of some two dozen Democrats expected to run for president in 2020. NPR's Asma Khalid is in Iowa and has been talking to Democratic voters about what they're looking for in a candidate in these early stages of the 2020 primary campaign. ASMA KHALID, BYLINE: Elizabeth Warren has one central message for voters. The middle class is getting hollowed out. And this weekend, she took that message across Iowa with pit stops in a couple of pretty Republican counties. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ELIZABETH WARREN: It's a dangerous time for our country. And I very much appreciate the effort that folks here in Iowa put into helping us determine the direction our country will take from here. KHALID: When you ask Democrats in Iowa what's important to them, a lot of them mention the same few issues - health care, college affordability, the climate and the economy. In the huge field of potential presidential Democratic candidates, there's a degree of nuance on these issues. But voters do not necessarily see major policy differences - at least not yet. And so what it comes down to for a lot of folks, like Richard Malloy from Sioux City, is just somebody who can beat Donald Trump. RICHARD MALLOY: Oh, right now it's very strong we get another Democrat back in, and we get Trump out. It's my main objective right there. KHALID: You cannot overstate how frequently Democrats bring this up. They want someone electable. But that word, electability, means different things to different people. Some voters want a candidate who'll bring a more aspirational message. Others, like Geri Frederiksen, want a politician who will punch back against Donald Trump. GERI FREDERIKSEN: Whoever it is has to be able to stand up to him. I don't think you have to stoop to his level. But you have to be firm. KHALID: This is Iowa. And so Democrats here, like Jean McGinnis, feel their party needs a candidate who can talk to voters in red states. McGinnis was in line to get her picture taken with Warren. JEAN MCGINNIS: I'm looking for somebody with broad appeal so that we can pull in some of the independents and the Republicans. KHALID: And for McGinnis, Warren could be that person. But another voter in the crowd, Leif Erickson, is not so sure she is. LEIF ERICKSON: She stood up to Trump. And I don't know. Maybe it backfired on her a little bit. KHALID: The thing is, even though Iowans make their choice first, they're not necessarily representative of what Democrats across the country want. Some Democrats in other states say the party ought to forget about winning Trump voters back and, instead, focus on boosting turnout among minorities. But here in Iowa, the consensus is the party needs someone who can go into rural neighborhoods and try to win them over. Warren's economic message resonates with voters at her rallies. And some say they're impressed with how she's taken on the banking industry. But they also say they've got a year to make up their minds. They want to see more candidates. MARILYNN LEGGIO: I want somebody to get Trump out of there big time. KHALID: That's Marilynn Leggio. She brought her teenage granddaughter with her to a Warren rally. She says she has no doubt the Massachusetts senator would do a good job. But she's not sure, after what happened with Hillary Clinton, whether a woman can win. LEGGIO: I think there's a lot of men out there that would never vote for a woman. I hate to say that. But I think that, especially a woman that's strong, you know, very opinionated - I think a lot of men think she's pushy. KHALID: But even if voters, including Leggio, cannot agree on exactly what this idea of electability means, they point to a common trait - authenticity, someone who just feels real, whether or not that alienates people.

            "article_content": "Democratic Sen. Kamala Harris, who's a candidate for the 2020 presidential election, has endorsed \"Medicare for all.\" But the details of what that means are rather elusive.  RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: Various Democratic presidential hopefuls are getting behind an idea long thought to be on the outer edge of progressive politics - so-called \"Medicare-for-all.\" Senator Kamala Harris endorsed the idea the other night in a CNN town hall. She also suggested getting rid of all private insurance. Clearly health care is going to be a major issue in the Democratic primary and seems like a good moment to have NPR's health policy correspondent Alison Kodjak on to educate us. Good morning, Alison. ALISON KODJAK, BYLINE: Good morning, Rachel. MARTIN: We've heard this phrase for a long time, but it's worth explaining it again. Can you just describe what exactly is \"Medicare-for-all\"? KODJAK: Yeah, so what Senator Harris says she is supporting is a bill that was proposed by Bernie Sanders, and that would create a national single-payer health plan that would replace the whole private insurance system. And here's how she described it. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KAMALA HARRIS: Well, listen; the idea is that everyone gets access to medical care. And you don't have to go through the process of going through an insurance company, having them give you approval, going through the paperwork, all of the delay that may require. KODJAK: So everyone would get a Medicare card just like the one that my elderly mother has, and doctors would have to sign an agreement to participate in the program. MARTIN: And as you point out, this is the same thing as the single-payer system. So everyone may hear \"Medicare-for-all\" and think, oh, this is just for, you know, elderly people. But this is actually - what she's proposing is a much more substantive overhaul of the current health care system. KODJAK: Yeah, it's huge. It would change everybody's health insurance. MARTIN: How would it be paid for? KODJAK: Well, that's the big unknown. MARTIN: (Laughter). KODJAK: I mean, it would clearly have to be through some sort of tax increase. Harris didn't specify what she wanted to do in her town hall, and Sanders, in the proposal that he put on the table, did outline some options. Right now we spend about $3 1/2 trillion a year on health care, and Sanders says his - making \"Medicare-for-all\" will cost less. But the proposals to pay for it would be maybe a tax increase on employers to replace what they're now paying for health insurance premiums like a Social Security tax or maybe a tax increase on personal income tax. And then there are always proposals to increase tax rates on the wealthy high-earners and reduce their deductions. MARTIN: So we know Kamala Harris is behind this idea. What about the other candidates who've thrown their hat into the ring thus far? KODJAK: Yeah, well, we have Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Elizabeth Warren who both also co-sponsored Senator Sanders' bill, so the - that Democratic crowd is pretty much all in. You have two so-called moderate billionaire businessmen who are testing the waters, those centrist candidates. Howard Schultz, the former CEO of Starbucks - he called this program not American because it would eliminate the health insurance industry. Mike Bloomberg - he says a \"Medicare-for-all\" plan would, quote, \"bankrupt us.\" So those two potential candidates aren't quite as supportive as the three senators who have already co-sponsored Senator Sanders' bill. MARTIN: I mean, we should just point out it wasn't that long ago that there was an overhaul of the American health care system that gave birth to the Affordable Care Act. So - and these Democrats are arguing that didn't go far enough. But this is a very politically difficult issue. I mean, how does it poll with the public? Do Americans want a single-payer system? KODJAK: You know, conceptually they do. Fifty-six percent of people in a recent poll said they were supportive. But when you get into the nitty gritty - like, you're going to have to change your insurance, and if you like it, you won't get to keep it - people don't like that. People never like to hear that they're going to have to pay more taxes even if it replaces their insurance premiums. And of course the insurance industry is going to fight this like crazy... MARTIN: Right. KODJAK: ...If it gets to that point. MARTIN: NPR's Alison Kodjak - thanks, Alison. KODJAK: Thank you, Rachel. MARTIN: One correction now - earlier we described the Kamala Harris campaign as backtracking from one aspect of \"Medicare-for-all.\" Her campaign has said that in fact she remains supportive of the \"Medicare-for-all\" bill she co-sponsors with Bernie Sanders.

            "article_content": "Twelve Democratic candidates debate Tuesday in Ohio, as the race has been shaken by impeachment, Bernie Sanders' heart attack and Elizabeth Warren's challenge to longtime front-runner Joe Biden.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: The impeachment inquiry and President Trump's efforts to get foreign governments to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden provide an unusual backdrop to tonight's Democratic presidential debate. NPR's Mara Liasson and Scott Detrow are with us from Westerville, Ohio, where 12 candidates, including Biden, are taking the stage tonight. Hi, Scott and Mara. SCOTT DETROW, BYLINE: Hey there. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Hi, Ari. SHAPIRO: This has become a really dynamic race on a number of fronts. Let's start with Biden. Today we heard from Hunter Biden for the first time in an interview with ABC News. He said he exercised poor judgment but did nothing wrong. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) HUNTER BIDEN: Did I make a mistake? Well, maybe in the grand scheme of things, yeah, but did I make a mistake based upon some unethical lapse? Absolutely not. SHAPIRO: And yesterday, former Vice President Joe Biden announced an anti-corruption policy plan, and he used that to attack the Trump administration. He calls it the most corrupt administration in modern history. Mara, what do you make of how Biden is handling this heading into the debate? LIASSON: I think Biden is trying to answer a real chorus of calls from Democrats who have been begging him to be more aggressive about this to use it as a kind of jujitsu to show that he is the best person to go up against Donald Trump. That's kind of the rationale of his whole candidacy. And this is something the Democrats say they haven't been seeing from Biden, even though he has been getting a little bit more aggressive bit by bit. SHAPIRO: And what about the other candidates, Scott? How do you see them handling this? It's a very delicate issue for them. DETROW: You know, I feel like in previous debates, criticizing Joe Biden has almost been the defining characteristic of the debates, other candidates going after Biden's age, his previous policies on race, on gender, other things. But when it comes to criticizing Biden and his family for these things that President Trump is attacking him on, there's been a real reluctance from Democrats. I think that's really summed up by an answer that Elizabeth Warren gave in the days after this all came to a head, asked would she allow her vice president's son or family member to hold a position on a foreign company like Hunter Biden did. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ELIZABETH WARREN: No. I don't - I don't know. I mean, I'd have to go back and look at the details. LIASSON: No other Democratic candidate wants to look like they're prosecuting the president's attacks on Biden because the president's attacks have been debunked. Now, is there a legitimate concern that there was an appearance of impropriety with Hunter Biden being on the board of a Ukrainian company when Ukraine was in his father's portfolio as vice president? Yes. Hunter himself acknowledged that in his ABC interview. But I think there is a reluctance on the part of other candidates to use this as their own attack against Biden. I do think, however, the moderators of this debate are going to bring it up a lot. SHAPIRO: So Elizabeth Warren heads into this debate with a lot of organization and money built up. She has effectively ended Biden's claim on being the only front-runner in this primary race. Mara, do you think that she is overcoming those questions we heard earlier in the race about electability? LIASSON: No, I don't. I think that Democrats are telling pollsters that they see her as more electable, but there is a real undercurrent of worry that she is too far left to beat Donald Trump in a general election. She's taken a lot of positions that are 2-to-1 unpopular with general election voters. She wants to institute mandatory \"Medicare for All.\" That means an end to private health insurance. She's for banning fracking. I don't know how well that goes over in the parts of Pennsylvania that are not the Philadelphia or Pittsburgh suburbs. And there have been some culture war issues where she has come down pretty much on the left. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Hi, Senator. Thank you for being here. LIASSON: There was a moment in a recent LGBTQ forum on CNN where she was asked by an activist what she would say to someone who believes that marriage is between one man and one woman. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) WARREN: Well, I'm going to assume it's a guy who said that. (LAUGHTER) WARREN: And I'm going to say then just marry one woman. (LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE) WARREN: I'm cool with that. LIASSON: She got a big applause, but she didn't leave it there. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) WARREN: Assuming you can find one. (LAUGHTER) LIASSON: The first part of that answer was just fine - so just marry one woman. The second part - assuming you can find one - sounded like she was saying that anyone who has those beliefs is either a loser or maybe deplorable. SHAPIRO: All right. Well, this is also going to be the first time that many voters have seen Senator Bernie Sanders since he had a heart attack. Scott, he has not been doing campaign events since that happened two weeks ago. Does he seem worried about the future of his campaign? DETROW: His campaign is really going out of its way to show that Bernie Sanders has remained active even if he hasn't been on the campaign trail, including videos of him playing baseball in his backyard. They had a timestamp on that video as if to say like, look. It's today. He's out there right now playing baseball. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO) BERNIE SANDERS: All right. Good catch. DETROW: But this is the first big test of Bernie Sanders in something that is a high-stress, high-pressure environment, no matter what your age and what your health level, standing on national television for several hours going at it with a lot of other candidates. SHAPIRO: Well, apart from Sanders, Warren and Biden, there are going to be nine other candidates on that stage. What are you looking for tonight? DETROW: Well, Mara has framed this the Biden understudy primary, right? There are so many candidates whose path to the nomination really runs through Joe Biden's starting to fade. They've been waiting and waiting all spring, all summer for that to happen. It hasn't happened. There have been a few signs that Biden is looking more vulnerable, though. He's been dropping in the polls a little bit. And he's been outraised by a lot of other candidates. So it seems like it's a now-or-never moment for some of these candidates. I think the top of the list is South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who's been spending a ton of time in Iowa. Kamala Harris has been trying to double down on Iowa as she's faded in the polls as well. I think you could include Cory Booker in this list as well. LIASSON: Yeah. I think Pete Buttigieg is definitely at the top of the heap when it comes to the Biden understudy battle. He's been taking some pokes at Elizabeth Warren, saying that she's been evasive about how she's going to pay for some of these plans. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PETE BUTTIGIEG: The answer to that question of whether her plan and Senator Sanders' plan will raise middle-class taxes is yes. Why you wouldn't just say so and then explain why you think that's the better way forward? LIASSON: The directed frontal attacks on Biden that some candidates have tried haven't worked. Big question is, will somebody try a similar kind of attack on Elizabeth Warren? I would say if anybody does that, it would probably be Pete Buttigieg. SHAPIRO: That's NPR's Mara Liasson and Scott Detrow in Westerville, Ohio, where they are covering tonight's debate. Thank you. DETROW: Sure thing. LIASSON: Thank you. SHAPIRO: That CNN/New York Times Democratic presidential debate is at 8 p.m. Eastern Time. It airs live on CNN. And you can hear it on many NPR stations. Copyright \u00a9 2019 NPR.

Kirsten Gillibrand, Bernie Sanders and Jeff Merkley hold an event to introduce the \"Medicare for All Act of 2019\" near the U.S Capitol in April. Elizabeth Warren made sure to specially thank South Carolina Rep. James Clyburn when they introduced their student debt forgiveness plan this week. The reason: He might actually get a vote on it. \"I am deeply grateful to the congressman for taking this first piece on student debt cancellation so that we have a chance to work it through the House. Right now, we're not likely to get a vote in the Senate,\" she said, to chuckles in the audience. \"But [we] have a chance to work it through the House so we can iron out any kinks and get it ready to go so that soon, I hope, we have people in the House and the Senate who are interested in passing this and we have someone in the White House who will sign it into law,\" the Massachusetts senator added. She's not wrong to hope, but then, this scenario represents an uphill climb for her party. Even if Democrats win the White House and hold onto the House next year, winning the Senate already looks tough. And even then, to pass some of their most ambitious proposals, Democrats would either need a filibuster-proof majority (60 senators) or to blow up the filibuster altogether, which it's not clear that all Democratic senators would want to do. All of which raises a tough, basic question: If a policy just doesn't seem viable even if a candidate wins, what does the debate accomplish? \"Priming\" the issues It's not just student debt cancellation; Democrats have discussed a wide variety of potential policies that would be hard to pass, even with a majority in the Senate: Reparations for slavery, the Green New Deal, expanding the Supreme Court and \"Medicare for All\" are dramatic proposals that appear to have very difficult paths to passage. Even a less-drastic proposal, like a public option for health insurance, could be a stretch. Medicare for All, as presented by lawmakers like Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, is maybe the highest-profile example in this primary of a hyperambitious plan \u2014 not only would it be an overhaul of the U.S. healthcare system, but also it would go further than even many existing single-payer systems around the world, as Sarah Kliff has reported at Vox. And it would have a tough time of passing. Sanders has said he would try to pass it via reconciliation, which only requires a simple majority of 51 senators. But even if he could, and even if Democrats had 51 senators after 2020, getting those votes would be a stretch considering that an array of current Democratic senators oppose Medicare for All to some degree. It is still true, however, that debating it now doesn't do nothing. Politicians like Sanders and Warren may recognize that even if their policies don't pass in their respective (hypothetical) presidencies, talking about the policy now could lay the groundwork for Medicare for All in the future. \"The campaign does serve the purpose of priming people or helping them to understand the contours of the debate so that when you get to the time that you're actually trying to pass legislation, people have already had exposure to the issues at play,\" said Lanhee Chen, who was policy director on the 2012 Mitt Romney campaign. It also could open the Overton window \u2014 the range of policies that that are considered realistic ideas \u2014 wider, in the process making it more likely that a smaller \u2014 but still major \u2014 change could happen in the nearer term. \"I think that a very legitimate reason for why a candidate would propose a bold health care plan like Medicare for All, even if they're not going to be president or if they can't get it passed is, over the long term, it moves public opinion and political will in your favor and it may be easier to have something like public option,\" said Jennifer Palmieri, director of communications on Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign. All of this debate comes at a price, however, says Robert Blendon, professor at Harvard's T.H. Chan School of Public Health. He believes that talking this much about Medicare for All takes oxygen away from other related issues that voters care about more \u2014 and that might have more of a shot at seeing bipartisan changes. \"You give them a list and you discover that they're actually not talking about Medicare for All or a redo of the Affordable Care Act,\" he said. \"They're focused on their own pocketbook issues: high drug costs, charges by hospitals and insurance premiums. And they're not concerned about overall spending.\" It's true that Medicare for All proponents argue that their plan would tackle all of these problems. One of their challenges, then, is convincing voters that a wholesale overhaul of the system is the right fix. Never say never It's not that pushing bold ideas is an entirely calculated, cynical move \u2014 candidates have ideas they believe in, even if those ideas don't seem to have much of a path to reality. On that note, there's one important caveat: Programs are impossible to pass until they're not. That shift can happen relatively quickly. \"John F. Kennedy ran in 1960, and Medicare for retirees was one of his lead issues,\" Blendon says. \"He wins and the leaders from the House and Senate meet with him and tell him that's in no way possible.\" But then, after Kennedy was assassinated and President Lyndon Johnson took office, a couple short years passed, and Congress swung hard toward more liberal Democrats. \"Lyndon Johnson meets with the same leaders and they say, 'Lyndon, we can pass the Medicare bill,' \" Blendon said. \"For a big change to occur, you would have to have a change in the president and their leanings and the Congress. But that happens every now and then.\" What candidates get out of it But from a calculated political point of view, there's also a lot to gain from talking about these sorts of big, ambitious policies \u2014 for one thing, even if ideas like Medicare for All aren't popular with the total electorate, they are often much more popular with Democratic primary voters. In addition, putting bold ideas out there can help a candidate tell a particular story about themselves. \"It tells voters that you think you get the depth of the problem,\" Palmieri said. \"And it tells voters that your inclination is to have a very bold solution, and well beyond the policy, that tells voters something about the kind of person you are.\" For example: Talking about Medicare for All helps Sanders reinforce that he wants to remake government \u2014 as he put it at the start of a recent speech on the policy: \"While we're at it, let's make a political revolution. Warren, similarly, has rolled out plan after plan \u2014 which has helped her craft an identity as the detailed policy thinker of the pack. On the flip side, former Vice President Joe Biden is also using Medicare for All to distinguish himself, as he appears to be readying himself to weaponize California Sen. Kamala Harris' support for the policy against her in next week's debates. Having a list of bold ideas can also be necessary for candidates who are Congress members in a time of gridlock. \"If you're a senator or a member of Congress and you were running for president, you're probably not going to have much of a legislative accomplishment record to run on because Congress has been so dysfunctional,\" Palmieri says. \"So the manner by which you distinguish yourself is a very bold policy idea.\"",

Listen to The NPR Politics Podcast here. The impeachment of President Trump has dominated the news this week. But the political focus shifted to the Democratic presidential candidates Thursday night for their sixth debate, this one in Los Angeles and hosted by the PBS NewsHour and Politico. The first subject to come up? Impeachment. But there are no real cleavages between the candidates on that subject. After all, each of the candidates thinks he shouldn't be in office. That's why they're running against him. There was a notable moment when former Vice President Joe Biden defended his continued regard for bipartisanship despite him and his family coming under attack from Republicans in the Ukraine saga. \"If anyone has reason to be angry with the Republicans and not want to cooperate, it's me,\" Biden said, adding, \"I have no love. But the fact is, we have to be able to get things done. And when we can't convince them, we go out and beat them like we did in the 2018 election in red states and in purple states.\" 1. Biden was steady Biden was crisper than in most of the other debates, and, unlike those other debates, his steadiness lasted mostly all the way through. He sidestepped a question, about whether he would run for a second term if elected, given his age \u2014 77. And he was, at times, tougher with his opponents. For example, telling Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont to put his hand down while Biden was finishing an answer. Biden didn't dominate the debate, and, at times, he faded from view, but that's something of a win for him. The steadier he is, the fewer of Biden's supporters \u2014 and potential supporters \u2014 will be wringing their hands. 2. Buttigieg came under attack It took awhile for it to happen, but, as expected, South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg faced some pointed attacks. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts went after him on fundraising (yes, in a \"wine cave\") and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota on his experience. \"The mayor just recently had a fundraiser that was held in a wine cave full of crystals and served $900-a-bottle wine,\" Warren said. \"Think about who comes to that.\" \"I have not denigrated your experience as a local official,\" Klobuchar said, pointedly contrasting Buttigieg's municipal job with hers in Congress. Buttigieg parried the attacks with some skill, especially toward Warren on fundraising. \"I am literally the only person on this stage who is not a millionaire or a billionaire,\" he said, adding, \"This is the problem with issuing purity tests you cannot yourself pass.\" Buttigieg also hit back at Klobuchar, noting that he had won the 2015 South Bend mayor's race \"with 80% of the vote as a gay dude in Mike Pence's Indiana.\" But Klobuchar got the last word, noting he had lost the 2010 race for Indiana state treasurer \"by 20 points. I'm sorry. That's just the math.\" (It was 25 points.) Buttigieg has been surging in Iowa and New Hampshire, and both Warren and Klobuchar see him as an obstacle to their candidacies. He leads with college-educated whites, a group Warren is second with, according to the latest NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll. And for Klobuchar to have a chance at the nomination, she has to do well in Iowa, as she's from a neighboring state. Media no longer available Credit:  NPR 3. Money remains a key divide \u2014 and potential problem for Democrats The exchange between Warren and Buttigieg on fundraising highlighted an important split in the Democratic Party \u2014 how to raise money. But it also highlighted another reality \u2014 money is important in politics. Polling shows Democratic primary voters want to get money out of politics, but running presidential campaigns costs billions of dollars. Literally, billions. And here's the reality: President Trump doesn't care where the money comes from, and, so far, is raking in far more than any of the Democratic candidates. \"It's not an easy decision, especially because I support a robust system of public financing of elections,\" Barack Obama said in 2008 of his decision to forgo public financing. \"But the public financing of presidential elections, as it exists today, is broken and we face opponents who've become masters of gaming this broken system.\" Democrats will have a lot of catching up to do on the fundraising front once a nominee is named. It's one reason incumbent presidents have such an advantage. 4. Some issues came up that hadn't and others got attention in different ways Climate change was a focus earlier than in past debates. And other topics, which have received little-to-no attention, also came up \u2014 everything from trade and China to Muslim Uighurs and Israel and the Palestinian territories. It's a reminder that there are lots of things a president has to deal with \u2014 and often has more control over \u2014 than many of the topics that dominate presidential campaigns. 5. Health care didn't come up until late One topic that came up later than usual (10:06 p.m. ET, more than two hours into the debate) was health care. The candidates have debated health care ad nauseam in prior debates, but Thursday night's had a new wrinkle \u2013 whether the candidates calling for big change would be in favor of less sweeping measures if Medicare for All failed to pass Congress as a replacement for private health insurance . The question was directed to Sanders, and he wouldn't say. \"We're going to have the American people behind us; we will have the Congress behind us,\" Sanders insisted. Biden said he didn't think that was \"realistic.\" And that highlights the real fracture in the Democratic Party primary \u2014 the purists versus the pragmatists. Klobuchar chimed in to defend both Biden and herself. \"I think you can be progressive and practical at the same time,\" she said, adding that Sanders' fight wasn't really with her or Biden, but with new House members from moderate districts and with Andy Beshear, the new Democratic governor of conservative Kentucky, who wants to build on Obamacare. \"If you want to cross a river over some troubled waters,\" Klobuchar said, \"you build a bridge, you don't blow one up.\" Notably, the other candidate in favor of Medicare for All stayed silent for most of the exchange. When Warren did speak up, she answered the moderator's original question and noted some less-sweeping health care measures she supports and believes could pass Congress. Last month, Warren walked back her full-throated support of Medicare for All, endorsing an interim step \u2013 a Medicare for All \"option.\" It's a critical change for Warren. It makes her look more practical, and the move represents a pivot and admission that her full and uncompromising support of Medicare for All was hurting her presidential bid. After all, Medicare for All as a full replacement of private health insurance is much less popular than if presented as an option. 6. Democrats had to deal with a less-diverse stage With Sen. Kamala Harris of California dropping out of the race and Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey and former Obama housing secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro not qualifying for the debate, this was not only the smallest number of candidates on a Democratic stage this cycle, but it was also the least diverse. \"It's both an honor and disappointment to be the lone candidate of color on the stage tonight,\" entrepreneur Andrew Yang said, adding that while he was called names for being Asian growing up, blacks and Latinos \"have something much more powerful working against them than words. They have numbers.\" Yang noted that African Americans and Latinos have only a fraction of whites' net worth. \"These are the numbers that define race in this country,\" he said. \"And the question is, 'Why am I the lone candidate of color on this stage?' Fewer than 5% of Americans donate to political campaigns. You know what you need to donate to political campaigns? Disposable income.\" The other candidates on stage tried to point out, in different ways, their own claims to diversity. Buttigieg noted that he is the son of an immigrant father and at least twice made reference to being gay. Warren and Klobuchar highlighted, in sometimes humorous ways, that they were the only women on stage. Warren, 70, was asked about the fact that if elected, she would be the oldest person to take office as president (a distinction currently held by Trump; Biden and Sanders would be older still). \"I'd also be the youngest woman ever inaugurated,\" she quipped. And Klobuchar said she once pointed out to Trevor Noah of The Daily Show, \"in the history of the Senate, there was something like 2,000 men and only 50 women in the whole history.\" (The numbers are 1,926 and 56, according to Senate and House historians.) Noah's response, Klobuchar said: \" 'If a nightclub had numbers that bad, they would shut it down.' \"",

            "article_content": "Sheila Morrison of Derry, N.H., says health care is her top issue as a voter. When asked what she hopes to accomplish with her vote, Morrison says: \"Improve my life and the life of people like me.\"\n                \n                    \n                    Ryan Kellman/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Sheila Morrison was in Canada when she fell into her third diabetic coma. \"My 90-year-old cousin thought we had a lunch date, and so she came with her daughter to pick me up,\" she says. \"And I wouldn't answer the door.\" Her visitors were able to get inside and called an ambulance when they found her. Morrison remained in the coma for about a week. \"When I woke up, they told me that another hour, too, and I wouldn't have survived,\" she recalls. Receiving care for this coma in Canada offered Morrison a chance to compare that country's approach to her care in the United States. In Canada, everybody gets basic coverage under a government-provided system. People have the option of buying more coverage on the private market. The comparison reflects one of the biggest divides among the Democratic presidential candidates: What should the health care system look like? Should the party push to expand Medicare just enough to give access to those who want it \u2014 a strategy supported by more moderate candidates like Joe Biden, Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar? Or should Democrats try to get rid of private health insurance and create a national health plan \u2014 akin to Canada's \u2014 something like \"Medicare for All\"? That's the approach favored by Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. In conversations with voters in New Hampshire, where people will vote in the primary in February, Democrats expressed a wide range of views about this policy debate. Shelia Morrison's perspective on health care is partly informed by her experiences working for an insurance company where she handled negotiations between doctors and insurers.\n                \n                    \n                    Ryan Kellman/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Shelia Morrison's perspective on health care is partly informed by her experiences working for an insurance company where she handled negotiations between doctors and insurers. Morrison says her experience in Canada ultimately made her appreciate her private insurance in the U.S.  She remembers that it was harder for her to get tests and things like CT scans done in Canada. \"It goes to show the differences,\" she says. \"I mean, the United States has superior health care \u2014 if you have the right insurance and can get access to it.\" Morrison's perspective is also informed by her experiences working for an insurance company \u2014 and before that, a hospital \u2014 where she handled negotiations between doctors and insurers. \"I spent a lot of my time asking these people like, 'Yeah? You're saying it's not medically necessary. Where did you get your medical degree?' \" she recalls. After years of negotiating for others, Morrison now has to advocate for her own medical interests. She has been in stable recovery from alcohol addiction for eight years. She is getting good treatment for depression, and she is committed to monitoring her diabetes. Morrison says her insulin pump's sensor, which indicates when her blood sugar is low, isn't covered by her insurance.\n                \n                    \n                    Ryan Kellman/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption But every time she spends hours trying to negotiate her own medical bills, one thought keeps going through her head: \"God help the people that don't have the background that I have.\" Morrison emerged from her last diabetic coma with some brain damage. So she's now on disability and gets coverage through Medicare. But the program doesn't cover all of the tools that would help her stay healthy. She has an insulin pump but not the sensor, which would tell her when her blood sugar is low but is not covered by insurance. So she has to check manually. She is supposed to check her levels eight times a day. Between the care and the fights with insurance, dealing with health care issues is a full-time job, she says. \"But I've learned acceptance,\" she says. \"There's nothing I can do about it other than vote.\" Health care is Morrison's top issue for 2020. And she says she won't be voting for a candidate who wants to eliminate private insurance,  which she says works well for some people. She's skeptical of giving the government that much power. \"I'm a little fearful of a government-run system,\" she says. \"When you get the government involved, you get restrictions.\" Marcella Termini at her home in Manchester, N.H. She is raising two boys on the autism spectrum and says having excellent health coverage is vital to her family.\n                \n                    \n                    Ryan Kellman/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Marcella Termini at her home in Manchester, N.H. She is raising two boys on the autism spectrum and says having excellent health coverage is vital to her family. Marcella Termini falls on the opposite side of the debate. Termini and her family live in Manchester. Their home is covered with a combination of Christmas decorations and Bernie Sanders signs. Health care is also a constant source of stress for her. She has three children, including 11-year-old twin sons with autism spectrum disorder. She ticks off only a few of their many health care needs: \"Neurology appointments, occupational therapy, speech therapy ...\" The list goes on. The family has had to arrange its life around health care. Termini's husband, Jason, commutes more than an hour each way to a teaching job in Massachusetts. Marcella Termini says Massachusetts mandates that insurance companies cover certain autism therapies that New Hampshire does not. \"He could have got a job in New Hampshire and made fairly decent money,\" she says. \"But we still wouldn't have the insurance coverage.\" Termini's husband, Jason, commutes more than an hour from Manchester (pictured) to a teaching job in Massachusetts because the health plan he gets there covers more of their sons' needs.\n                \n                    \n                    Ryan Kellman/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption As difficult as the commute is, life is easier now than before Jason took the Massachusetts job. \"It's been a lifesaver because otherwise, we'd still be in crisis mode trying to figure out what the kids needed for their services, their everyday needs, even just doctor's appointments,\" she says. \"It can be really expensive. We wouldn't be able to cover a mortgage and all of the copays.\" That personal experience leads her to conclude that private insurance isn't working. And she's ready for the U.S. to get rid of it. \"Some of the therapies and doctors that our family needs to see \u2014 some insurances won't cover them, some insurances will cover half, and, you know, the copays are just outstanding.\" (Clockwise from top left) Jason Termini, Marcella Termini, Lena Termini and Vincent Termini.\n                \n                    \n                    Ryan Kellman/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Like Sheila Morrison, Termini's No. 1 policy issue for the 2020 election is health care. She knows there are people who support expanding Medicare to cover more people but who also want to keep their insurance. \"I just feel like that's coming from a real place of privilege,\" she says. \"It's great that you have great insurance and you can afford it and you like what they cover. But there are whole communities of people who just absolutely cannot afford even the basic health care because of what the insurance costs are.\" Rob Kiefner, a retired physician in Concord, N.H., says his views on health care are informed by years of treating patients.\n                \n                    \n                    Ryan Kellman/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Rob Kiefner, a retired physician, has supported the idea of Medicare for All for decades, based on his experiences as a doctor. \"I saw people die for lack of insurance. I saw people forgo vital medications for lack of insurance,\" he says. He points to an uninsured patient who came to see him because he was urinating blood. \"He had something going on in his urinary tract and it could have been a stone or it could have been a tumor,\" he recalls. \"And the CT scan with hematuria protocol that we'd have to order, we priced it out. That was going to be $6,000. So he refused to have it.\" Eventually the issue cleared up, which means it was likely he did have a stone, but Kiefner says the thing that sticks with him is that the patient  \"was not willing or able to come up with those funds to pay for that test.\" Randy Hayes with his recently adopted dog, Pirate, in Canterbury, N.H. Hayes, a retired physician, wants to see incremental change in the health care system, like that created by the Affordable Care Act.\n                \n                    \n                    Ryan Kellman/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Randy Hayes with his recently adopted dog, Pirate, in Canterbury, N.H. Hayes, a retired physician, wants to see incremental change in the health care system, like that created by the Affordable Care Act. Randy Hayes is another retired physician. In fact, he and Kiefer have been friends for over 35 years, treating the same community in Concord, N.H. They even served as each other's personal physician. Now they lead a health care working group for a progressive organization called the Kent Street Coalition. But Hayes has a different view from his friend. \"I would support Medicare for some, Medicare for more, at the drop of a hat. But I am not convinced that the government running the entire billing process at this point is in the best interests of the country,\" he says. He says it doesn't take tearing down the system to fix the problem that Kiefner highlighted with his example of the patient urinating blood. \"I think that when you talk about a test being denied, you talk about a system that can be easily fixed,\" Hayes says. A pivotal experience for Hayes was watching how effective incremental change can be with the reforms of the Affordable Care Act, which included defining mental health care as an essential benefit. He describes treating a patient with complicated mental illness in an integrated model, where he and a psychiatrist worked together and shared notes. \"These are all refinements in care that never would have happened prior to President Obama's program,\" he says. \"It didn't take a total redo of the system, but a better alignment of incentives.\" He is also skeptical that the public would get behind a Medicare for All model. \"I am totally open to an increased role for government. I'm just pushing for an incremental approach as we move forward,\" he says. \"We keep one foot in our current experience, one foot in our future aspirations, and see if we can gradually come to a program that nearly half the country doesn't consider to be evil.\" Roger Tilton visited Milford, N.H., to see Amy Klobuchar speak. He asked the Democratic presidential candidate about her position on health care.\n                \n                    \n                    Ryan Kellman/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Roger Tilton visited Milford, N.H., to see Amy Klobuchar speak. He asked the Democratic presidential candidate about her position on health care. Nearly everyone in the country at some point comes into contact with the health care system, which is perhaps why it has become such a major issue in the Democratic primary. On a wintry day in Milford, N.H., Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota showed up at a coworking office and took a handful of questions from voters. Almost half were on health care, even though that isn't the biggest part of her pitch. One of the questioners, Roger Tilton, described leaving a Wall Street job to start his own business. \"The last three years, I've had no health care at all because it's too expensive,\" he said. He says a policy would cost him $19,000 a year and still have a $6,000 deductible. He's 59 and says he is hoping to stay healthy until he can get on Medicare in six years. \"If we reduce the age for Medicare from 65 to 55, hey, I'm in. That's cool. I like that,\" he says. He says it seems like a public option \u2014 a system that lets people buy in to a government-run program, like Medicare \u2014  is the bare minimum for the Democratic Party right now, and he supports that idea. \" 'Medicare for All' is a great slogan,\" Tilton says, but he is skeptical that the American public would get behind a policy change that would force millions of Americans off their private insurance. The disagreements in the Democratic primary make it easy to miss that people of both parties actually agree on something big here, according to Lucy Hodder, director of health law and policy at the University of New Hampshire Franklin Pierce School of Law. \"A majority of people in the United States really do want to make sure everybody has insurance coverage,\" she says. Political signs dot the landscape around Concord, N.H., ahead of the Democratic primary.\n                \n                    \n                    Ryan Kellman/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption A Kaiser Family Foundation poll this year found that a majority of Americans think positively of universal health coverage, she points out. And support for all Americans getting insurance from a single government plan has grown from 40% two decades ago to more than 50% in favor today. So if Americans generally want everybody to have health care, then the big questions are just about how to provide that care. That's not easy to answer, says Hodder. \"So we're going to need to decide together \u2014 what does health care mean?\" she says. \"What do we intend to cover for everybody? What are the choices?

Thursday marks the smallest debate lineup yet for the 2020 Democratic presidential primary as the Democratic National Committee continues to raise the polling and fundraising thresholds to qualify. Joe Biden, former vice presidentPete Buttigieg, mayor of South Bend, Ind.Amy Klobuchar, senator from MinnesotaBernie Sanders, senator from VermontTom Steyer, business executive and activist Elizabeth Warren, senator from Massachusetts Andrew Yang, entrepreneur and philanthropist The debate will be moderated by Judy Woodruff, anchor of PBS NewsHour; Amna Nawaz, PBS senior national correspondent; and Yamiche Alcindor, PBS White House correspondent. They will also be joined by Politico's chief political correspondent, Tim Alberta. According to Politico, the debate will not feature any candidate opening statements, and there will be three designated breaks throughout the event. Former New York City Mayor and billionaire Michael Bloomberg entered the presidential race in late November. Just over a week later on Dec. 3, Sen. Kamala Harris of California ended her presidential bid, surprising many as one of the higher-profile candidates in the race. Harris had qualified for Thursday's debate but ended her campaign because of inadequate fundraising. Shortly after Harris' withdrawal, the hashtags #DemsSoWhite and #DebateSoWhite were used to criticize the anticipated debate for featuring almost exclusively white candidates. Andrew Yang, who is Asian American, qualified for the debate on Dec. 10. Several candidates who did not qualify for the debate \u2014 including New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro \u2014 have spent the past few weeks publicly campaigning against the DNC's new requirements, arguing that the new rules are too restrictive and limit potential voices of color on the stage.

Meanwhile, Biden maintains a national lead at 24%, followed closely by Sanders at 22%, Warren at 17% and Buttigieg at 13%, according to the latest NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist Poll. The same polling shows a continually growing gap between those candidates and the rest of the contenders \u2014 with Yang next at 5% and  Klobuchar, Bloomberg and Booker at 4%. For a time, it was unclear whether any of them would make it to the stage. The debate comes on the heels of a newly settled labor dispute between the food-service workers at the school and their contracting company Sodexo, a fight that prompted all seven candidates to threaten to boycott the event in solidarity with the workers. The workers and Sodexo reached an agreement Tuesday, and the debate will remain at Loyola Marymount University.

            "article_content": "Democrats are divided on the platform of Medicare for All. NPR's Ari Shapiro talks to voters in New Hampshire about how their experience with the healthcare system informs their views on the policy.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: From the time you're born to the time you die, most everybody in the U.S. uses health care. So when Democratic presidential candidates debate how much to change America's health care system, the stakes can feel personal. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: I'm a little fearful of a government-run system. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: I'm an entrepreneur, and I'm under 65 years old. So I don't have any health care at all. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: Some insurances won't cover them. Some insurances will cover half. And you know, the copays are just outstanding. SHAPIRO: These New Hampshire Democrats are just two months from casting votes in the first primary in the nation. I went there to hear how people's firsthand experience getting sick and being treated shapes their view of this debate. SHEILA MORRISON: I just put on a fresh pot of coffee. SHAPIRO: When Sheila Morrison fell into her third diabetic coma, she was in Canada. MORRISON: The first two comas, alcohol played a big role. The third one, alcohol didn't play a big role. But I still hadn't recognized that I was a Type 1 diabetic and I needed to take care of myself. SHAPIRO: Canada gives everybody basic coverage under a government-provided system. People have the option of buying more coverage on the private market. MORRISON: It goes to show, you know, the differences. I mean, the United States has superior health care if you have the right insurance and can get access to it. SHAPIRO: Sheila Morrison understands these systems well because she's worked for an insurance company, and before that, a hospital, where she handled negotiations between doctors and insurers. MORRISON: I spent a lot of my time asking these people - I'm like, yeah, you're saying it's not medically necessary. Where did you get your medical degree? SHAPIRO: After years of negotiating for others, Sheila now has to advocate for her own medical interests. And she's taking it seriously. She's been sober for eight years. She's getting good treatment for depression, and she's committed to monitoring her diabetes. But every time she spends hours trying to negotiate her own medical bills, one thought keeps going through her head. MORRISON: God help the people that don't have the background that I have. SHAPIRO: Sheila emerged from her last diabetic coma with some brain damage. So she's now on disability and gets coverage through Medicare. But the program won't cover all the tools that would help her stay healthy. She has an insulin pump, but she says the sensor to tell her when her blood sugar is low isn't covered, so she has to check manually. MORRISON: I check my sugar with my glucometer here. SHAPIRO: She's supposed to check her levels eight times a day. Between the care and the fights with insurance... MORRISON: It's a full-time job (laughter), you know? But I've learned acceptance. There's nothing I can do about it, other than vote, which I do. SHAPIRO: And when you cast that vote, what do you see it as a vote for? What are you hoping to do with your vote? MORRISON: Improve my life and the life of people like me. SHAPIRO: For her, that will not be a vote for a candidate who wants to eliminate private insurance. She's skeptical of giving the government that much power. MORRISON: People who get insurance through their employer - decent insurance through their employer - if it's working for them and they're paying 20 bucks a week, then go for it. SHAPIRO: Here's the basic divide among Democratic presidential candidates on health care. Some want to eliminate private insurance and put every American on a program like Medicare. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders fall into that group. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE) ELIZABETH WARREN: We're going to do this by saying everyone is covered by \"Medicare for All.\" BERNIE SANDERS: Medicare for All - that means no deductibles, no copayments, no out-of-pocket expenses. SHAPIRO: Others want to expand Medicare without forcing everybody to give up private insurance. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE) JOE BIDEN: We should build on Obamacare. PETE BUTTIGIEG: I propose Medicare for All who want it. AMY KLOBUCHAR: A public option, a nonprofit choice that would... SHAPIRO: That group includes Joe Biden, Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar, among others. KLOBUCHAR: I also want to thank all of you for being willing to come out in the snow. SHAPIRO: One sign of how important health care is to the primary - on a wintry day in Milford, N.H., Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar showed up at a co-working office and took a handful of questions from voters. Almost half were on health care, even though that isn't the biggest part of her pitch. Roger Tilton described leaving a Wall Street job to start his own business. ROGER TILTON: The last three years, I've had no health care at all because it's too expensive. SHAPIRO: He's 59 and told me he's hoping to stay healthy until he can get on Medicare in six years. TILTON: If we reduce the age for Medicare from 65 to 55, hey, I'm in. That's cool. I like that. SHAPIRO: He says it seems like a public option is the bare minimum for the Democratic Party right now, and he's for it. He is lucky not to need care. Marcella Termini and her family live in Manchester. And for them, going without health care isn't an option. MARCELLA TERMINI: For the boys - they were diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder at age 2 1/2. So from there, we've had neurology appointments, occupational therapy, speech therapy. SHAPIRO: Marcella's 11-year-old twins each get different treatments for autism. Her son Vinnie is homeschooled and was excited to have visitors. VINNIE: I've been collecting Rudolph stuff for, like, two years. SHAPIRO: Vinnie, you've been collecting Rudolph stuff? VINNIE: Yeah. See? And I have more in my bag. SHAPIRO: Nice. And this is the season to finally bring it all out. VINNIE: Well, no. I keep it out all year. SHAPIRO: You keep it out all year. VINNIE: Yeah. SHAPIRO: But this is the season that it really feels right. VINNIE: Yeah. SHAPIRO: Yeah. OK. Marcella's husband Jason wasn't home because he commutes more than an hour each way to a teaching job in Massachusetts. The family told us Massachusetts mandates that insurance companies cover certain autism therapies, and New Hampshire does not. TERMINI: He could've got a job in New Hampshire and made, you know, fairly decent money, but we still wouldn't have the insurance coverage. SHAPIRO: On the one hand, it must feel like a huge inconvenience to have to jump through these hoops. On the other hand, you must feel really lucky that Massachusetts is so nearby. TERMINI: Yeah. It's been a lifesaver because otherwise, we'd still be in crisis mode trying to figure out, you know, what the kids needed for their services, even just doctor's appointments. It can be really expensive, and we wouldn't be able to cover a mortgage and all of the copays. SHAPIRO: That personal experience leads her to conclude that private insurance isn't working. And she's ready to get rid of it. TERMINI: Just knowing the limits that private insurance puts on certain things. SHAPIRO: What do you say to people who are very encouraging of expanding Medicare to cover everyone who wants it, but also want to hang on to their own private insurance that they're happy with? TERMINI: I think - this is going to sound awful. I just feel like it's - that's coming from a real place of privilege. It's great that you have great insurance and you can afford it and you like what they cover. But there are whole communities of people who just absolutely cannot afford even the basic health care because of what the insurance costs are. SHAPIRO: The disagreements in the Democratic primary make it easy to miss that people of both parties actually agree on something big here. LUCY HODDER: A majority of people in the United States really do want to make sure everybody has insurance coverage. SHAPIRO: Lucy Hodder is the director of health law and policy at the University of New Hampshire Law School. She says this is a major shift. If Americans generally want everybody to have health care, then the big questions are just about how to provide that care. HODDER: So we're going to need to decide together. What does health care mean? What do we intend to cover for everybody? What are the choices, and how do we want to make the choices about cost and quality? SHAPIRO: Do you think this country is up to having that kind of a debate in an honest, fact-based way? HODDER: It's really hard, and the language we use is really hard. SHAPIRO: This is a debate the entire country is having. It's just most visible right now among the Democrats running for president. The votes that people in New Hampshire cast two months from now will be a way for some Americans to start making their preferences known. Later this week, we'll translate some of the complicated jargon in this debate. Single-payer, Medicare for All, public option - we'll explain what it all means.

            "article_content": "Former President Barack Obama has been taking a more vocal role in the 2020 presidential primary recently, and there's a fierce debate over whether any candidate can reconstruct the multiracial coalition that he built in 2008.\n                \n                    \n                    Michael Sohn/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Former President Barack Obama has been taking a more vocal role in the 2020 presidential primary recently, and there's a fierce debate over whether any candidate can reconstruct the multiracial coalition that he built in 2008. When Barack Obama stood in Chicago's Grant Park facing throngs of people in 2008 and declared that \"change has come to America,\" Arielle Monroe was a freshman in college. Obama was her generation's rock star, who swept away the nation's last remaining racial barrier in politics and inspired a multiracial, multigenerational coalition to support him. \"All different kinds of people related to this man, how we all believed in him,\" she said. \"There was this whole message of hope \u2014 right? \u2014 in that it'll all get better for people who have grown up maybe not feeling that that's a possibility.\" Now, with less than three months before Democratic voters begin to cast ballots to select their nominee, Monroe is one of many voters who hasn't yet found a candidate to inspire her in that same way. \"I'm not excited right now, but I hope to be soon,\" she said. More than a decade after his election, which represented one of the most hopeful moments in American politics, a debate is breaking out among Democrats over Obama's legacy and which direction the party should go during a moment in which the historic divides Obama sought to bridge seem more vast than ever. At a recent gathering of Democrats in Wyandotte County, Kan., Melissa Bynum said she wants to hear candidates paint a big-picture vision for the future. But she worried that some candidates weren't recognizing Obama's legacy. \"Well, I think that they need to make sure that they are acknowledging all of the good that he was able to accomplish in his eight years in the White House,\" she said. She specifically mentioned health care, which has been one of the most animating issues of the Democratic presidential primary. The debate over the direction in which the party should go spilled into public view during the November presidential debate, hosted by MSNBC and The Washington Post. Early in the evening, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders was asked about Obama's recent remarks about the electorate, made at a Washington gathering of the Democracy Alliance. \"This is still a country that is less revolutionary than it is interested in improvement,\" Obama said during his Nov. 15 remarks, according to audio of his remarks that was captured off microphone. \"They like seeing things improved. But the average American doesn't think that we have to completely tear down the system and remake it. And I think it's important for us not to lose sight of that.\" Democratic strategist Joel Payne said Obama's comments were both an \"implicit defense of the Obama years,\" as well as \"a bit of the warning to the party to not lurch too far, in this instance, to the left.\" They were also an apparent beginning of a more public role in the 2020 primary for Obama, who until recently had largely kept a low profile. Sanders, who has campaigned on calls for a political revolution, was asked whether Obama was incorrect. \"No, he's right,\" Sanders said. \"We don't have to tear down the system, but we do have to do what the American people want.\" Then he segued into a defense of the \"Medicare for All\" single-payer proposal he's championed as a replacement to the Affordable Care Act. During last week's debate, Democrats also tussled over who would be the best candidate to reinvigorate the multiracial, multigenerational cohort of voters whom Obama brought to the polls in 2008. California Sen. Kamala Harris repeatedly, explicitly argued that she is the candidate \"who has the ability to go toe-to-toe with Donald Trump and someone who has the ability to rebuild the Obama coalition and bring the party and the nation together.\" Former Vice President Joe Biden said that he was \"part of that Obama coalition,\" adding that he came \"out of a black community, in terms of my support.\" And South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg said he wants to build a coalition that includes not just left-leaning voters, but moderates and \"future former Republicans,\" adding that \"everybody is welcome in this movement that we're building.\" But days before the debate, Paul Avila doubted that lightning could strike twice. \"Well, I'm not sure it's possible. That happened over a decade ago,\" he said when asked if any candidate in the race could rebuild the Obama coalition. \"Things have changed a lot over the past 10 years. I don't see anybody yet that could be another Barack Obama.\" Avila is still undecided in the 2020 race but says he's leaning toward supporting Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren or Sanders because they're \"much more progressive, willing to take more chances in order to win.\" He also likes Buttigieg, who he described as \"sharp as a tack.\" But he was less bullish on Biden, who he says \"is a little past his prime, and he also has some baggage that he's carrying around\" from his Senate career. When asked about Obama, Avila said that he was a \"good president, but there were some things about his presidency that left a lot to be desired.\" Florentino Camacho \u2014 who attended the Wyandotte County Democrats breakfast and lives in Kansas City, Mo. \u2014 said that Obama was one of the best presidents of his lifetime and praised him for being a president who fought for all Americans, something he said President Trump isn't doing. But he worried that Democrats could be unprepared for the playbook Republicans will throw at them in the general election. \"I think they're doing good, but they have to start fighting as bad and as dirty as the Republicans,\" he said. Gary Bradley-Lopez, 21, supported Hillary Clinton in 2016 and said that no current candidates are \"bringing the kind of fire\" that Clinton did that year, or that Obama did in the two prior elections. He says his biggest priority in a candidate is that they be a woman or a person of color \u2014 he isn't interested in electing another white man. And he says that though he's \"culturally\" excited for candidates like Harris, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker and former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick, he still doesn't know who he'll support. \"I'm not sure if there's a candidate that right. Like, 'Oh, I can't wait to go knock on doors for them' or 'I can't wait for them to be president,' \" he said. \"I'm not sure that candidate is even in the race yet.\"",

Candidates will have 75 seconds to answer direct questions and 45 seconds for follow-ups, as allowed by the moderators. In the last debate, Warren ended up with far more speaking time than other candidates. Former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick entered the race last week. Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg is reconsidering whether to jump in himself. O'Rourke, as noted above, dropped out; so has Republican primary challenger Mark Sanford and Democratic Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan. Buttigieg has taken Warren's place as the surging candidate of the moment. The group of female freshman lawmakers who have come to be called \"The Squad\" have split when it comes to presidential endorsements. Rep. Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts is backing Warren, while Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan have all endorsed Sanders. Warren explained how she would pay for \"Medicare for All\" amid criticism that the candidate with a plan for everything was falling short when it came to health care.

He was talking about Samuel Shem's 1978 novel about medical residency, an infamous book whose legacy still looms large in academic medicine. Shem \u2014 the pen name of psychiatrist Stephen Bergman \u2014 wrote it about his training at Harvard's Beth Israel Hospital (which ultimately became Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center) in Boston. My professor told me not to read it, I imagine, because it's a deeply cynical book and perhaps he hoped to preserve my idealism. Even though it has been more than 40 years since its publication, doctors today still debate whether it deserves its place in the canon of medical literature. The novel follows Dr. Roy Basch, a fictional version of Shem, and his fellow residents during the first year of their medical training. They learn to deflect responsibility for challenging patients, put lies in their patients' medical records and conduct romantic affairs with the nursing staff. Basch's friends even coin a term that is still in wide use in real hospitals today: Elderly patients with a long list of chronic conditions are still sometimes called \"gomers,\" which stands for \"Get Out of My Emergency Room.\" Like any banned book, The House of God piqued my curiosity, and I finally read it this past year. I'm a family physician and a little over a year out of training, and I read it at the perfect time. I got all the inside jokes about residency \u2014 and many were laugh-out-loud funny \u2014 but I am now far enough removed that the cynicism felt like satire rather than reality. The House of God also felt dated. Basch and his cohort \u2014 who were, notably, all men, although not all white \u2014 didn't have electronic medical records or hospital mergers to contend with. They wrote their notes about patients in paper charts. And it was almost quaint how much time the doctors spent chatting with patients in their hospital rooms. It couldn't be more different from my experience as a resident in the 21st century, which was deeply influenced by technology. There's research to suggest that my cohort of medical residents spent about a third of our working hours looking at a computer \u2014 112 of about 320 working hours a month. by Samuel Shem Hardcover, 369 pages | Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How? In The House of God, set several decades before I set foot in a hospital, where were the smartphones? Where was the talk of RVUs \u2014 relative value units, a tool used by Medicare to pay for different medical services \u2014 or the push to squeeze more patients into each day? That's where Shem's new book comes in. Man's 4th Best Hospital is the fictional sequel to The House of God, and Basch and the gang are back together to fight against corporate medicine. This time the novel is set in a present-day academic medical center, and almost every doctor-patient interaction has been corrupted by greed and distracting technology. Basch's team has added a few more female physicians to its ranks, and together they battle a behemoth of an electronic medical record system. The hospital administrators in Shem's latest book pressure the doctors to spend less time with every patient. If The House of God is the great medical novel of the generation of physicians who came before me, perhaps Man's 4th Best Hospital is the book for my cohort. It still has Shem's zany brand of humor, but it also takes a hard look at forces that threaten the integrity of modern health care. I spoke with Shem about Man's 4th Best Hospital (which hit bookstores this week) and about his hopes for the future of medicine. This interview has been edited for clarity and length. The protagonist in Man's 4th Best Hospital, Dr. Roy Basch, doesn't have a smartphone. I hear you don't either. Why not? If I had a smartphone, I would not be able to write any other novels. I have a bit of an addictive personality. I'd just be in it all the time. ... I've got a flip phone. You can text me, but it has to be in the form of a question. I have this alphabetical keyboard. You either get an \"OK\" or an \"N-O.\" A big theme in the novel is that technology has the potential to undermine the doctor-patient relationship. What made you want to focus on this? I got a call out of the blue five years ago from NYU medical school. They said, \"Do you want to be a professor at NYU med?\" And I said, \"What? Why?\" And they said, \"We want you to teach.\" When I first got there, because I had been out of medicine [and hadn't practiced since 1994], I figured, \"Oh, I'll look into what's going on.\" And I spent a night at Bellevue. On the one hand, it's absolutely amazing what medicine can do now. I remember I had a patient in The House of God [in the 1970s] with multiple myeloma. And that was a death sentence. We came in; we did the biopsy. He was dead. He was going to be dead. And that was that. Now it's curable. At Bellevue, I saw the magnificence of modern medicine. But like someone from Mars coming in and looking at this fresh, I immediately grasped the issues of money and effects of screens \u2014 computers' and smartphones'. And it just blew me away. It blew me away: the grandeur of medicine now and the horrific things that are happening to people who are really, sincerely, with love, trying to practice it. They are crunched, by being at the mercy of the financially focused system and technology. In Man's 4th Best Hospital, there's a fair amount of nostalgia for the \"good old days\" of medicine in the 1960s and 1970s, before electronic medical records. What was better in that era? If you ask doctors of my generation, \"Why did you go into medicine?\" they say, \"I love the work. I really want to do good for people. I'm respected in the community, and I'll make enough money.\" Now: ... \"I want to have a good lifestyle.\" Because you can't make a ton of money in medicine anymore. You don't have the respect of your community anymore. They may not even know much about you in a community because of all these [hospital] consolidations. Do you think anything in medicine has gotten better? The danger of isolation and the danger of being in a hierarchical system \u2014 students now are protected a lot more from that. When I was in training, interns were just so incredibly exhausted that they started doing really stupid things to themselves and patients. The atmosphere of training, by and large in most specialties, is much better. You wrote an essay in 2002 titled \"Fiction as Resistance,\" about the power of novels to help make political and cultural change. What kind of resistance today can help fix American health care? When somebody falls down, up onstage at a theater, do you ever hear the call go out, \"Is there an insurance executive in the house?\" No. If there are no doctors practicing medicine, there's no health care. Doctors have to do something they have almost never done: They have to stick together. We have to stick together for what we want, in terms of the kind of health care we want to deliver, and to free ourselves from this computer mess that is driving everybody crazy, literally crazy. Doctors don't have a great track record of political activism, and only about half of physicians voted in recent general elections. What do you think might inspire more doctors to speak out? Look at the difference between nurses and doctors. Nurses have great unions, powerful unions. They almost always win. Doctors have never, ever formed anything like what the nurses have in terms of groups or unions. And that's a big problem. So doctors somehow have to find a way \u2014 and under pressure, we might \u2014 to stick together. Doctors have to make an alliance with nurses, and other health care workers, and patients. That's a solid group of people representing themselves in terms of what we think is good health care. The profession we love has been taken over, with us sitting there in front of screens all day, doing data entry in a computer factory. Health care is a big issue for the upcoming election. What kind of changes are you hoping we'll see? There will be some kind of national health care system within five years. ... You know, America thinks it has to invent things all over again all the time. Look at Australia. Look at France. Look at Canada. They have national systems, and they also have private insurance. Don't get rid of insurance. The two biggest subjects for the election are health care and health care. ... The bad news is, it's really hard to get done. The good news is, I think it's inevitable. The good news is, it's so bad it can't go on. One of the major criticisms of The House of God is that it's sexist. It seems like your hero, Dr. Basch, has gotten a little more enlightened by the time of Man's 4th Best Hospital. Does this reflect a change you've also experienced personally? I was roundly criticized for the way women were seen in The House of God. I remember the first rotation I had as a medical student at Harvard med was at Beth Israel, doing surgery. It got to be late at night, and I was trailing the surgeon around, and he went into the on-call room. There was a bunk bed there, and he started getting ready to go to bed. And I said, \"Well, I'll take the top bunk.\" And he said, \"You can't sleep here.\" So I left, and in walked a nurse. I was shocked. Things have changed, and I am very, very glad. I don't know if it seems conscious \u2014 I was very pleased to have total gender equity in the Fat Man Clinic [where the characters in Man's 4th Best Hospital work] by the end of the book. What made you feel like it was time to update The House of God? I write to point out injustice as I see it, to resist injustice, and the danger of isolation, and the healing power of good connection. ... We can help our patients to get better \u2014 but nobody has time to make the human connection to go along with getting them better.

The field of 2020 presidential candidates with health care overhaul plans is crowded, and Pete Buttigieg, mayor of South Bend, Ind., is drawing lines of distinction between his proposal and his competitors' plans. \"I mean, the reality is, all these beautiful proposals we all put forward, their impact is kind of multiplied by zero if you can't actually get it through Congress, and it's one of the reasons why I do favor the approach that I have,\" he said. \"We make sure that everybody can afford [public health insurance], but we don't require you to take it.

And partly I think that's just the right policy, because I think people should be able to choose,\" Pete Buttigieg said. Buttigieg would offer public health insurance to those who want it while also keeping private health care plans available. Other candidates' proposals, including \"Medicare for All\" \u2014 backed by Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren \u2014 would replace the current system with a single-payer, government-run program and eliminate private insurance altogether. Buttigieg spoke to two undecided Indiana voters and NPR host Scott Simon as part of the Off Script series of interviews with 2020 presidential candidates. \"We make sure that everybody can afford [public health insurance], but we don't require you to take it. And partly I think that's just the right policy, because I think people should be able to choose,\" he said. \"But it's also really important that that's a policy that commands the support of most Americans. ...

Stahl's 5-year-old son has a condition that requires treatment that if uninsured would cost her family $35,000 a month. She said the health care system can be confusing even for those in the industry, and Americans who do their best to stay in-network can be faced with large surprise medical bills.

I'm here to launch the era that comes next.\" The ideological divisions between the leading Democratic candidates for president were on clear display at the rowdy Iowa Liberty and Justice Celebration on Friday evening. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren took aim at her more moderate rivals during her remarks, slamming them for \"vague ideas that are designed not to offend anyone.\" \"If the most we can promise is business as usual after Donald Trump, then we Democrats will lose,\" Warren said, in a clear shot at both former Vice President Joe Biden and South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg. \"We win when we offer solutions big enough to touch the problems that are in peoples' lives.\" Buttigieg was the first candidate to take the stage. The 37-year-old casting himself as both a voice of a new generation reminiscent of President Barack Obama that could also bring back a sense of calm and order to the Oval Office. \"I didn't just come here to end the era that is Donald Trump. I'm here to launch the era that comes next,\" Buttigieg told the crowd. \"Because in order to win, and in order to lead, it's going to take a lot more than the political warfare we have come to accept from Washington, D.C.\" Warren is leading the current polls in Iowa, but Buttigieg has seen his numbers rise in the state lately. And both had the loudest and largest crowd of supporters inside the Des Moines arena. The annual Iowa Democratic Party dinner is part fundraiser and part pep rally that takes on an outsized role every four years. Each White House hopeful gets 10 minutes to make his or her pitch on an important stage just three months before the first Democratic 2020 voters will weigh in. Candidates pay for their supporters to attend, outfitting them with signs, lights, noisemakers and chants. They hold events and rallies outside the event and march with banners and signs into the dinner. Buttigieg pitched himself as a fellow Midwesterner who made his first trip to the state \"knock on doors for a young man with a funny name,\" feeding the Obama comparisons that he hopes could help him pull off an upset in the state just like the former Illinois senator did that propelled him to the nomination in 2008. And while Obama also faced questions about his age and experience, Buttigieg said he believed that a better way in politics was still possible despite the caustic current environment. \"Call it optimistic, but do not call it naive, because I believe these things not based on my age, but based on my experience,\" Buttigieg said. But Warren argued hard that change couldn't come incrementally but in the bold, sweeping ideas that she has called for, including Medicare for All. Both Buttigieg and Biden back more modest health care changes that would still include public and private plans. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren said change couldn't come incrementally but in the bold, sweeping ideas that she has called for.\n                \n                    \n                    Clay Masters/Iowa Public Radio\n                    \n                \nhide caption Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren said change couldn't come incrementally but in the bold, sweeping ideas that she has called for. To applause from the crowd, Warren said she knew such change was possible because she had already proved it could be done when she helped create the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. And she chastised her rivals that said she couldn't achieve similar success as president. \"They see an America where they won't be able to make the changes they need,\" Warren said \u2014 again not mentioning Biden or Buttigieg by name, though the references were clear. \"Afraid because they are either too cynical or too downtrodden to believe that change is possible. Well, not me. I believe in change and I know we can get it done,\" she added. \"Anyone who comes on this stage and tells you to dream small and give up early is not going to lead our party to victory.\" Biden has seen his standing in Iowa dropping, and to try to regain momentum, he made more of a general election pitch \u2014 namely that Trump was most afraid of facing him in a general election. \"We have got to beat this man. It's not enough that we just beat him \u2014 we've got to beat him soundly so everyone knows we are not going back to a time when another president like him can hold that office,\" Biden said. \"And I will beat him like a drum if I'm your nominee, and he knows it.\" The current impeachment inquiry in the House centers around the president's call with the Ukrainian president where he pressured him to investigate Biden and his son Hunter's business dealings in the country, although no wrongdoing on their part has ever been shown.

But he largely aligned with Warren \u2014 who may be his ideologically progressive partner but also someone who represents a real rival for a top finish in the state. Other candidates' speeches also provided a possibly last-ditch effort to try to create momentum. California Sen. Kamala Harris, who has recently laid off staff in other early states as her fundraising has lagged, got a strong response as well, passionately talking about how she took on Trump's attorneys general in the Senate. Others played up their connections to Iowa. Neighboring Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar joked she could \"see Iowa from my porch.\" And New Jersey Sen.

Bernie Sanders at a campaign rally in Queensbridge Park in New York on Saturday.\n                \n                    \n                    Kena Betancur/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders at a campaign rally in Queensbridge Park in New York on Saturday. About three weeks ago, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders had a heart attack that threw his campaign into question. But now, it's more apparent than perhaps at any point in this presidential race that the 78-year-old white-haired politician and his revolution will remain a powerful force in the Democratic primary. Sanders' campaign has a renewed vitality following a record-setting rally in New York over the weekend, a strong debate performance last week in Ohio, an infusion of campaign cash that translates to having more money on hand than any other Democratic presidential candidate, and endorsements from two of the most progressive women of color in Congress: Reps. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York. His campaign is optimistic and emboldened with a clear mission: prove the senator's skeptics wrong, and quash any lingering questions about his health and ability to serve after his heart attack. \"In the professional pundit class, in the elite media circles, there's been a strong effort to discount Bernie Sanders: 'The movement is over, he can't succeed. He doesn't have opportunities for him to grow, it's gonna end for him,' \" said Faiz Shakir, Sanders' campaign manager, paraphrasing what he sees as a problematic narrative. But Shakir contends that the past week proves the pundits wrong. \"Sanders has shown that he has the support and the stamina to stick around,\" he said. On Saturday, the white septuagenarian was joined by perhaps the most well-known Latina in politics, the 30-year-old Ocasio-Cortez \u2014 an alliance that countered the \"Bernie bro\" caricature of his 2016 campaign. Ocasio-Cortez, a darling of the progressive left, officially offered her stamp of approval to the Vermont senator. \"For me, the mass movement, mobilization and the decades of work that have gone into that was a personal tipping point,\" Ocasio-Cortez told NPR's Michel Martin on Weekend All Things Considered, explaining why she specifically supported Sanders over a progressive woman in the field (such as Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren). \"It's far larger than a presidential campaign; this is about really creating a mass movement ... to guarantee health care, housing and education.\" Sanders hugs Rep.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez during last Saturday's campaign rally in Queens. Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez were met in Queens by a crowd that campaign officials estimated exceeded 25,000 people \u2014 a rally larger than any other Democratic candidate has seen this campaign. 'A loyal, strong base' Sanders is not the first presidential candidate in history to have had a heart attack. In fact, Dwight D. Eisenhower had one in 1955, a year before he was reelected for a second term. But Sanders has long been scrutinized for his age, and the moderators on the debate stage in Ohio last week were eager to get a response from him on the record. \"I'm healthy, I'm feeling great,\" Sanders quipped at one point, \"but I would like to respond to that question,\" he added, as he jumped into a conversation about the opioid epidemic and drug companies. Analysts and experts agreed Sanders looked and sounded healthy onstage. His positive debate reviews came on the heels of new fundraising numbers that showed his campaign had $33.7 million on hand at the end of the third fundraising quarter \u2014 more cash than any of his Democratic opponents, and notably more than three times as much money as former Vice President Joe Biden. \"If history is any guide, don't count Sen. Sanders out, he is someone who I think will be with us in this campaign for quite a while,\" said Karen Finney, a Democratic strategist who worked for Hillary Clinton in 2016. \"We know that he's got a loyal, strong base of support.\" Mark Longabaugh, a Democratic consultant who worked on Sanders' campaign in 2016, pointed out that part of the senator's fundraising advantage was his 2016 campaign operation. \"Just in a technical sense he came into this race with by far the largest fundraising list of any of the candidates,\" Longabaugh said. \"And that was underestimated by a lot of people.\" For Finney and Longabaugh, the main question is how and if Sanders can regain his standing in the polls. Even before his heart attack, Sanders' poll numbers had begun dropping. And the conventional wisdom was that the Democratic primary was winnowing down to a two-person contest between Biden and Warren. Shakir is dismissive of the polls and insists they don't capture Sanders' full support, but he also acknowledges that the senator has a steep path to the nomination. \"The path for Bernie Sanders to win this nomination is arguably the hardest and most ambitious path of any candidate,\" he said. Why? Because Sanders' base of support comes from young and lower-income Americans \u2014 people who usually vote at far lower rates than older and wealthier voters. \"He is trying desperately hard to increase voter participation,\" Shakir said. An urgency to differentiate Strategists say it's not enough to have a strong debate performance or bring in lots of money from devoted supporters. Sanders, they say, also has to figure out how to blunt Warren's momentum. One possible option is to focus on progressive policy. Sanders has been trying to prove that he's the furthest-left candidate in the field. For some of his supporters, that strategy is particularly effective on health care. Sanders, as he likes to point out, \"wrote the damn bill\" outlining a \"Medicare for All\" system. Warren has endorsed his plan but, thus far, has not laid out how she would pay for it. Sanders speaks at last Saturday's \"Bernie's Back Rally\" at Queensbridge Park in New York.\n                \n                    \n                    Greg Allen/Greg Allen/Invision/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Sanders speaks at last Saturday's \"Bernie's Back Rally\" at Queensbridge Park in New York. \"The Medicare for All message has sort of been his bread and butter, and I think that is still a powerful issue at the grassroots,\" Longabaugh said. Longabaugh, who is not working for Sanders this cycle, says part of the Vermont senator's resiliency goes back to his consistency, particularly on health care. Shakir says his loyal support is also about trust. \"You just trust that this is somebody who has a lifetime of consistency and that when he gets into the Oval Office and he says he's gonna fight for Medicare for All, he's gonna fight for Medicare for All,\" Shakir said. The indirect assumption from Shakir's statement is that Warren, the other leading progressive candidate in the field supporting Medicare for All, cannot be trusted as much as Sanders to keep their word on the issue. Sanders has also attempted to outflank Warren on one of her signature campaign issues: a wealth tax. He recently proposed a plan that goes even further than Warren's and, as our colleagues at Planet Money pointed out, it \"could have one large unintended consequence: It makes Warren's wealth tax look moderate.\" Sanders has been hesitant to go after Warren directly. The two senators are friends and allies in the Senate, but strategists say there is an urgency for Sanders to differentiate himself soon. Time is running out before the all-important early states start voting.",

            "article_content": "Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders had to take a break from the campaign trail because of a heart attack. But after this week's debate, Sanders is back, and strategists say don't count him out.  AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: Bernie Sanders returned to the presidential race this week after a recent heart attack, and the Vermont senator is looking to prove voters worried about his health wrong after a dip in the polls. A strong debate performance plus an infusion of campaign cash and a couple of key endorsements have his campaign looking up. NPR's Asma Khalid reports. ASMA KHALID, BYLINE: In the last Democratic debate, Bernie Sanders quickly tried to quash any lingering questions about his heart attack. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BERNIE SANDERS: I'm healthy. I'm feeling great. But I would like to respond to that question. KHALID: Sanders is not the first presidential candidate in history to have had a heart attack. Dwight Eisenhower had one a year before he was reelected. But Sanders has been scrutinized for his age, and the moderators on the debate stage would not let that issue go. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ERIN BURNETT: You're 78 years old, and you just had a heart attack. How do you reassure Democratic voters that you're up to the stress of the presidency? SANDERS: Well, let me invite you all to a major rally we're having in Queens, New York - berniesanders.com. We're going to have a special guest at that event. KHALID: That special guest Sanders was referring to is freshman Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. The progressive star endorsed Sanders this week, along with a fellow member of the so-called squad, Congresswoman Ilhan Omar. The endorsements were huge for Sanders, and they counter the Bernie-bro narrative of his 2016 campaign. They also came on the heels of new fundraising numbers that showed Sanders had more cash on hand than any of his Democratic opponents. KAREN FINNEY: If history is any guide, don't count Senator Sanders out. He is someone, I think, who will be with us in this campaign for quite a while. KHALID: Karen Finney is a Democratic strategist who worked for Hillary Clinton in 2016. FINNEY: We know that he's got a loyal, strong base of support. And the question will be, can he regain some of the momentum in the polling? KHALID: Even before his heart attack, Sanders' poll numbers had begun dropping, and the conventional wisdom was that the Democratic primary was essentially winnowing down to a two-person contest between Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren. Faiz Shakir is Sanders' campaign manager. FAIZ SHAKIR: In the professional pundit class, in the elite media circles, there has been a strong effort to discount Bernie Sanders. I mean, it's just like, oh, the movement is over. He can't succeed. He doesn't have opportunities to grow. It's going to end for him. KHALID: But Shakir contends this week proves the pundits wrong. Mark Longabaugh is a Democratic consultant. He worked on Sanders' campaign in 2016. MARK LONGABAUGH: Just in a technical sense, he came into this race - remember - with by far the largest fundraising list of any of the candidates. And that was underestimated by a lot of people, I think. You know, he had over 2 million-some people on his list. KHALID: Longabaugh also says Sanders' resiliency goes back to consistency, especially on one issue. LONGABAUGH: The \"Medicare for All\" message has been sort of his bread and butter, and I think that is still a powerful issue at the grassroots. KHALID: Shakir says voters fundamentally trust Sanders. SHAKIR: You just trust that this is somebody who has a lifetime of consistency and that when he gets in the Oval Office and he says he's going to fight for Medicare for All, he's going to fight for Medicare for All. KHALID: That last line from Shakir could be interpreted as a swipe at Warren, who has not been as clear in her support for Medicare for All and how she would pay for it. Sanders has been hesitant to go after Warren, but that could soon change. Strategists agree that Sanders needs to figure out how to blunt Warren's momentum because time is running out before the all-important early states start voting. I asked Shakir what Sanders' path to victory looks like. SHAKIR: The path for Bernie Sanders to win this nomination is arguably the hardest and most ambitious path of any candidate. KHALID: Why? Well, because the Sanders campaign needs to massively increase voter turnout. Sanders' base of support, after all, is young and lower-income people, people who usually vote at far lower rates than older and wealthier voters. Asma Khalid, NPR News.

He will be resting up over the next few days.\" Updated at 12:15 p.m. ET Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is canceling presidential campaign events \"until further\" notice following a heart procedure, campaign senior adviser Jeff Weaver said Wednesday morning. Weaver said in a brief written statement that Sanders \"experienced some chest discomfort\" during a Tuesday evening campaign event. \"Following medical evaluation and testing he was found to have a blockage in one artery and two stents were successfully inserted,\" Weaver said in the statement. \"Sen. Sanders is conversing and in good spirits. He will be resting up over the next few days.\" The campaign has not provided further information at this time. The news comes as Sanders was preparing for Wednesday campaign events in Nevada, including a \"Medicare for All\" town hall in Las Vegas. It also comes less than two weeks before the next Democratic primary debate, on Oct. 15 in Ohio. As of January 2016, Sanders had \"no history of cardiovascular disease,\" according to a letter from Sanders' doctor released as part of his 2016 presidential campaign. Health issues hurt Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential race, when a bout of pneumonia caused her to leave a Sept. 11 memorial service early. A video of the incident showed a weak-looking Clinton being assisted into a van. That led to a days-long discussion in the media of her health, as well as attacks from Donald Trump. This incident could raise questions about Sanders' age. Sanders, currently 78, would be the oldest president elected in U.S. history. He is also a top candidate in a Democratic field led by septuagenarians. Former Vice President Joe Biden is 76, and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren is 70. This has led to concerns from some voters about whether nominating a candidate that old is the best choice for the Democratic Party. Many of Sanders' fellow Democratic presidential candidates, including Biden, Warren, California Sen. Kamala Harris and others tweeted messages wishing Sanders a speedy recovery. .@DrBiden and I are sending our best wishes to @BernieSanders, Jane, and the whole Sanders family. Anyone who knows Bernie understands what a force he is. We are confident that he will have a full and speedy recovery and look forward to seeing him on the trail soon. Bruce, Team Warren, and I are sending all our best wishes for a speedy recovery to @BernieSanders. I hope to see my friend back on the campaign trail very soon. This week, Sanders announced that his campaign received $25.3 million in the third quarter of this year \u2014 the highest total of all Democratic campaigns that have announced their totals thus far. (Warren and Biden have not reported their numbers yet.)",

            "article_content": "Editor's note: This is an excerpt of Planet Money's newsletter. You can sign up here. \"I don't think that billionaires should exist,\" Senator and presidential candidate Bernie Sanders said last week. And he's now proposed a way to get rid of them: his version of a wealth tax on the .1% richest families in America. A wealth tax is like a property tax, but, instead of just taxing real estate, it taxes everything a person owns. The policy, aimed at reversing runaway inequality, would be new for the U.S. federal government, which typically taxes only income and estates. Like other wealth tax proposals on the table this election, Bernie's \"Tax on Extreme Wealth\" faces major obstacles, including questions about its efficacy and whether or not it's even permitted by the Constitution. Boss Tax Battle Sanders proposal comes almost a year after Senator Elizabeth Warren released her own wealth tax proposal \u2014 an \"Ultra Millionaire Tax\" \u2014 which has since become one of her marquee policies. Bringing up the tax at a campaign event in Washington Square Park last month, Warren was interrupted by an excited crowd, chanting \"two cents, two cents, two cents.\" \"Yes, that is a two cents tax on fortunes over $50 million,\" Senator Warren responded, turning to what's become a reliable talking point. Warren takes pains to paint her wealth tax as modest. She doesn't say she wants to eradicate billionaires. She just wants us to dip into their fortunes; an annual tax of \"just two cents\" on every dollar above $50 million and \"three cents\" on every dollar above $1 billion. Bernie's policy goes much further. It starts lower, beginning with a one percent tax on every dollar of a married couple's fortune over $32 million. It then goes up, two percent on fortunes between $50 and $250 million, three percent on $250 to $500 million, and up and up until it hits eight percent on all wealth over $10 billion. It may sound like nothing, but consider that if invested prudently, wealth, on average, grows about six to eight percent per year. To use Warren's framing, you could say it grows only six or eight cents per dollar per year. Under Bernie's proposal, if you're a billionaire, and you want to get richer, you're either going to have to be a financial genius, extremely lucky, or have really good accountants and lawyers to even just maintain your level of wealth. The tax, if effectively enforced, would eat fortunes. Jeff Bezos, for instance, would pay around $9 billion this year under the plan. Unlike Warren's proposal, Bernie's policy wouldn't just slow the growth of wealth at the top. It would essentially stop it. Bernie's team estimates the policy would slash billionaires' fortunes in half over the next 15 years and raise $4.35 trillion over the next decade. Warren's team says hers will raise $2.75 trillion over the same period. Like Warren, Bernie doesn't have any issues figuring out how to spend the money. His campaign says it will \"be used to fund Bernie's affordable housing plan, universal childcare and would help fund Medicare for All.\" Will it Work? A few months ago, Planet Money made an episode on the subject of wealth taxes. The policy has been tried many times before overseas. It hasn't worked out well. (You can also read our past Planet Money newsletter about it here ). Wealth taxes were difficult to enforce, encouraged rich people to move their wealth out of the country, hurt the economy by distorting investment decisions and, in the end, they didn't accomplish their main goal of raising lots of revenue. To combat the problems seen with wealth taxes overseas, Bernie's Tax on Extreme Wealth calls for expanding the role and power of the federal government. It calls for a \"national wealth registry\" and a major expansion of the IRS. And it includes an \"exit tax,\" which would confiscate 40 percent of a rich person's wealth under $1 billion and 60 percent over $1 billion if they renounce their citizenship and try to escape the tax. Even if not implemented, Bernie's wealth tax could have one large unintended consequence: It makes Warren's wealth tax look moderate. Did you enjoy this newsletter?

He's asking for applicants to submit their resumes online.\n                \n                    \n                    Stephen B. Morton/Georgia Port Authority via AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp needs to appoint a senator to fill Sen. Johnny Isakson's seat until a special election in November 2020. He's asking for applicants to submit their resumes online. Nearly the moment Republican Sen. Johnny Isakson announced his plans to resign late last month, rumors and speculation started flying about whom Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp would appoint to fill the seat. Isakson plans to leave the office he has held for nearly 15 years at the end of 2019 for health reasons. In an effort \"to ensure an open and transparent appointment process,\" Kemp has opened an online application process for anyone eligible to submit their resume or C.V. Within the first two days the governor had received nearly 200 applications, and they are all being made public. \"We will carefully vet the applicants and choose a person who best reflects our values, our state, and our vision for the future,\" Kemp said in a statement. Per the Georgia Constitution, any Georgia residents who have been U.S. citizens for at least nine years and are at least 30 years old are eligible. Hopeful senators have ranged from a sitting Georgia Public Service Commissioner to a Home Depot sales associate, a line cook to a theatre technician, a Republican political talk show radio host (and one-time congressional candidate) to an elementary school principal, a Southwest Airlines pilot to a women's gym owner. One of the hundreds of applicants is Michael Ventimiglia. He works as a chef in a restaurant in Macon, Ga., and is known as the Blues musician Big Mike. He decided to apply because he says he's a \"person of the people.\" \"I'm out in the street every day. I'm out in the bars. I play with a lot of people, bikers, always over to the Moose Lodge, the black clubs, and I hear what people are talking about, that most politicians don't even come around,  don't come close to.\" He says politicians today play on division, hate and prejudice. \"And I think politicians keep a bunch of this stuff stirred up. So they can keep their job. Without hate and prejudice, they have nothing to do.\" He says his chances of getting the job are slim to none,  but he likes the idea of possibly becoming a U.S. senator. Another applicant is Stuart Frohlinger who lives in Athens, Ga., and retired from the finance industry. He calls himself a fiscally conservative and socially liberal Republican \u2014 and cares a lot about people's personal finance. He is from New York and has lived in Georgia for about 2 1/2 years. \"Most people go through life without a financial plan, living either pay check to pay check or even if they have a lot of money they dribble it during the day,\" he says, \"they spend it. \" \"I think as a senator from Georgia, it's one thing I rarely hear \u2014 the Georgia government really asking people to be more proactive with their own life's finances,\" he says. \"People need to manage their finances better and not just think 'I get older and will get social security and Medicare.' That is not gonna happen that easily.\" 'A deep, deep bench'? The online application process \"changes the complete dynamics on how we thought this [appointment] was going to play out,\" said Georgia Republican communications strategist Brian Robinson. \"A lot of people who may have been in the private conversations with Kemp now aren't going to want to put their name out there as someone who is perhaps not particularly happy with the job or elected office they have now,\" he said. The names of several sitting members of Congress, including Republican Rep. Doug Collins, and sitting state constitutional officers have been floated as potential appointees. Collins confirmed Friday, according to The Hill, that he is seeking to be appointed to the seat. Kemp's office has not said whether formally applying is required. But Robinson said the governor risks making the process look \"silly\" if he does not select someone from the public applicant pool. Tharon Johnson, a Democratic Georgia political communications consultant, said the decision to open an online application process could have been about logistics. \"I think that [the governor and his staff] were getting inundated with so many calls. So many people saying, 'Pick this person, pick that person, hey I want it,' \" he said. In an earlier interview with WABE, Kemp said, \"I'm obviously hearing from a lot of people that have interest or who have recommended people to me. There's a deep, deep bench for us to pull from.\" Johnson added the move could negate a line of attack for Democrats, who will be running for the seat in 2020. \"No matter who we selected, we were going to say, 'Oh my God, look at who he selected, this process wasn't transparent, it wasn't open, the public didn't have any input.' \" Per the Georgia Constitution, the governor's appointee will only hold office until a special election is held in November 2020. That election will not have primaries, and the winner will face reelection again in 2022. That means both of Georgia's Senate seats are up for election next year.",

In gridlocked Washington, both Democrats and Republicans have signaled there's potential for a deal when it comes to lowering prescription drug prices. Now, there's an idea both Congressional Democrats and the White House seem to like: They want to base U.S. prices on something called an international price index. \"The basic idea is to peg what the United States pays for a particular drug to the price paid in some set of other countries,\" says Rachel Sachs, an associate professor of law at Washington University in St. Louis who specializes in drug pricing policy. \"There are many different ways to identify other countries, and there are many different ways in which that international reference price could be used to negotiate for a price here.\" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi unveiled her sweeping plan to reduce drug prices Thursday, which included an international price index. There are lots of differences between that plan and the one the White House floated last fall, but the basics \u2014 and the appeal of the concept \u2014 are the same. \"It stops drug companies from ripping off Americans while charging other countries less for the drug,\" Pelosi said in a press conference announcing the House plan, which would use drug prices in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, and the United Kingdom to create a baseline in negotiating prices. She's speaking President Trump's language. Here's what he told reporters in July: \"Why should other nations like Canada \u2014 why should other nations pay much less than us? They've taken advantage of the system for a long time, pharma.\" Earlier this summer, the Department of Health and Human Services sent its own IPI proposal to the White House for review, though the details haven't been made public. The idea of establishing an IPI is the only element of the administration's plan to lower prescription drug prices still on the table \u2014 other ideas, like displaying list prices in TV ads and ending secret rebates for middlemen have been withdrawn or blocked in the courts. A glimpse of what the HHS proposal might look like can be found in the outline of a Medicare model HHS released last fall. Like the House Democrats' plan, the HHS model uses an index of countries to generate an average price. But, unlike the House plan, it would not let the secretary of HHS use that average to negotiate directly with drugmakers. The HHS outline is also more limited in the drugs that would be eligible for this sort of price-setting. Medications eligible would be only a subset of drugs used by Medicare patients \u2014 mostly injections given in doctor's offices \u2014 whereas the House plan would extend to a wider group of 250 brand-name drugs. Another difference? \"The House Democrats' proposal envisions a non-compliance fee that would financially penalize drug companies who won't bargain in a good-faith way with the administration,\" Sachs says. \"There's no such enforcement mechanism in the administration's IPI proposal.\" Both plans would use the average price internationally for each drug as a benchmark in negotiations, so that Americans don't pay more than about 20% above what people in other countries pay. That's still more than what people pay outside the U.S., but less than they pay now. \"The prices the U.S. is currently paying today can be two or three times as much, [though it] varies a lot by product,\" says Stacie Dusetzina, a professor of health policy at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. \"This would be a major price reduction.\" One example of a drug priced much higher in the U.S. than elsewhere is Humira, a brand name rheumatoid arthritis drug. In 2015, it cost $2,669 a month in the U.S., while the list price in the U.K. was about half that \u2014 $1,362. The same drug cost only $552 in South Africa, according to the International Federation of Health Plans. \"I believe that the price of Humira now in the U.S. is about $63,000 a year,\" says Ben Wakana, executive director of the advocacy group Patients for Affordable Drugs. \"And [the drugmaker] AbbVie has raised the price eleven times between 2014 and 2018.\" Wakana has a personal connection to Humira \u2014 his brother. In the U.S., there's no generic competition that might push the price down, he notes. \"For patients like my brother and like the thousands of people who take Humira every year, that price is simply too high,\" Wakana says. \"We need competition. And if we can't get competition, then we need to be able to negotiate with AbbVie for a fair price \u2014 like they are offering in other countries.\" So, would establishing an international price index actually work to lower drug prices? The Trump administration projects that, in five years, using its IPI would save Medicare patients $3.4 billion. Policy analysts have argued that the amount patients would save is actually a bit murkier because many Medicare patients who use these drugs also have supplemental insurance. In addition, because so many countries \u2014 24 in Europe alone \u2014 use this kind of indexing, there's the risk of a circular effect, with everybody looking to their neighbor instead of basing the cost of the drug on concrete measures of the medicine's clinical value or the costs of developing and producing it. In Canada, the government already uses international drug list prices in negotiations, and has recently made moves to go even further. \"The comparison of our list prices in Canada to the list prices in other countries has proven to be not very effective at controlling the real price of medicines in this country,\" says Steve Morgan, a professor of health policy at the University of British Columbia. One reason for that, he says, is that list prices don't reflect real prices after drugmaker rebates. So now, he says, \"Canada is trying to implement further price regulations that would make sure that the final negotiated prices are reasonable.\" In the United States, many Republican lawmakers and conservative groups have opposed the idea of an international index \u2014 arguing that it runs against free market principles. Unsurprisingly, drugmakers also object. \"Speaker Pelosi's radical plan would end the current market-based system that has made the United States the global leader in developing innovative, lifesaving treatments and cures,\" Stephen Ubl, CEO of lobbying group PhRMA, says in a written statement. \"We do not need to blow up the current system to make medicines more affordable.\" But Pelosi and her allies seem to be betting there is political will to go against drugmakers this time. Despite the huge sums spent on lobbying, the pharmaceutical industry is now the most unpopular industry in the country, according to a recent Gallup poll. And with a presidential election coming up, Americans polled say lowering drug prices is a top priority. This could mean there's room for the House and the White House to work together, especially on an idea like an international price index that they've both proposed. \"We do hope to have White House buy-in,\" Pelosi said Thursday. \"That seems to be the route to getting any votes in the United States Senate, and certainly we want as strong a bipartisan vote as we can in the House and the Senate. So we would hope that they would support this.\"",

Bernie Sanders of Vermont participate in Thursday's debate in Houston.\n                \n                    \n                    Win McNamee/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Democratic presidential candidates former Vice President Joe Biden; South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg; and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont participate in Thursday's debate in Houston. There was something different about the Democratic debate this week, compared with the earlier rounds this summer. Something was happening that was hard to pin down, but it was palpable. Not the contrast of night and day, but perhaps the difference between dusk and dawn. It's a critical difference, and it comes at a crucial time. Because the Trump presidency these candidates are competing to truncate has reached what may be a critical juncture. But more of that in a moment. This week, the Democratic nomination fight once again took the form of a TV quiz show with too many contestants to fit onscreen at once. Once again, the candidates sounded a lot alike, peddling much the same wares as in June and July. And yes, three hours was too long. Yet something different happened. The debate left a clearer imprint. The effect was at least somewhat more energizing than the summer meetings, or perhaps just a bit less dispiriting. There were still 10 candidates onstage, but at least they were the candidates most people wanted to see and \u2014 best of all \u2014 there was not the prospect of 10 more contestants doing it all over on the following night. That made a difference. The earlier affairs had the feel of the NFL exhibition season, this week felt more like playing for keeps. On the substantive side, the candidate's answers and thoughts seemed more fully formed and more clearly expressed. Some of this is just practice. Some of these candidates are new to the big leagues; and veterans such as former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders are getting used to new roles. Some of the upgrade also seemed attributable to the ABC moderators, all four of whom were crisp. They had challenging questions and they probed in their follow-ups, but they did not intrude on the dynamic among the candidates. Like good referees, they pretty much let the players play \u2014 to the benefit of all. Benefiting most were the candidates who got the most airtime \u2014 Biden, Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren. Media no longer available Credit:  NPR Much was made of it being the first time that viewers had a chance to see Biden and Warren face off \u2014 with Sanders, the other candidate consistently in double digits, right there as well. It gave Democratic consumers their best chance for a taste test to date. Among the three, Warren seemed to make the most of it. She had the freshest energy onstage, and she is getting better at pressing a point. Her share of the airtime this week was nearly 17 minutes \u2014 second to Biden, but only by a few seconds. And she was showing passion on a range of outrages rather than intellectual irritation at the way things are. She also responded to questions and to the answers of her rivals with apparent spontaneity \u2014 even when she was recycling what might have been a practiced response. Most observers gave Biden, the putative front-runner, middling marks. For some, he was just OK, a left-handed compliment at best. For others, he was good enough, which isn't much better. All seemed to agree he wasn't bad. It's hard to know how Biden, soon to be 77, would look to the Democratic electorate based solely on this debate performance, given how long he has been around. Even more of a factor is the defensiveness many Democrats feel about the guy they still think has the best chance of beating President Trump. But more of that in a moment. Sanders, who is already 78, came across as every bit his age and just as irascible as he was at just 73 and challenging Hillary Clinton for the last presidential nomination. He once again made a strong case for the national health care system he calls \"Medicare for All\" \u2014 a concept that now gets at least lip service from many of his rivals, as well as pushback from a few. Even though Sanders' goal is to make the famous health program available to everybody, it is, for now, still primarily associated with old folks. It's likely to be the Democratic Party vehicle for getting to national health care, sooner or later, so it could use --\u2013 and likely will have \u2014 more age-appropriate champions. Still, it was Biden's age that was called into question in this debate, when he had talked about who would qualify under his amendments to Obamacare. Juli\u00e1n Castro, at one end of the stage, objected to what sounded like Biden contradicting himself. When Biden interrupted with a denial, Castro fired back, \"Are you forgetting already what you said just 2 minutes ago?\" Without that word \"already,\" that question might have stood on its own. Instead, it seemed a shot at Biden's age and past lapses of memory. The audience reacted with a mix of groans and applause. They took it as a shot, and it played as such endlessly on broadcast highlights and in panel post-mortems. Castro may have been the victim of his own need to distinguish himself from the pack, a problem shared by all but the three candidates at center stage. He was anchoring the end of the lineup because his polls and fundraising are barely meeting the criteria for inclusion. Also in endangered status was the candidate at the other far side of the stage, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who continues to emphasize her \"middle-of-the-country\" roots and middle-of-the-road positions. Her focus on the middle surely includes the early-caucus state of Iowa, her neighbor to the south, where she needs a breakout showing. Just inside from the two ends onstage were two candidates who were expected to make more noise than either has to date: One was Cory Booker, the senator from New Jersey, a tall and commanding figure who got the night's best laugh and said many eloquent things on gun violence and the status of his fellow black Americans. The Booker campaign professes to be unworried, but it is hard to fathom why Booker has not broken through in the early states or the national polls. The same might be said of Beto O'Rourke, the former congressman from El Paso whose campaign has drawn new impetus from last month's massacre in that city. O'Rourke was saluted by his rivals for his strong stance, and he had a viral moment saying: \"Hell yes, we're going to take your AR-15, your AK-47,\" referring to the military-style weapons used in many recent mass shootings. That promise, however, does not reflect the position of most of the other candidates or of the Democratic caucus in the House or the Senate. Moving in toward the centerpiece trio, one found Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind.,, who used every chance he got to insert thoughtful answers with a fine-chiseled edge. He used his closing remarks to say how much it had meant to his life to come out as gay and marry his husband. The fact that his age, 37, may be more of a weight for his candidacy than his sexuality is one measure of how life in America has changed. In mirroring status across the stage stood Andrew Yang, a young entrepreneur making a splash with younger voters and casting a wider net with ideas for guaranteed federal income payments (in lieu of other programs) and 100 Democracy Dollars to supplant lobbyists' actual dollars. Which leaves us with Kamala Harris, the one candidate who stood aside from the threesome at center stage but was not part of the trio on either wing. The California senator tried a good-natured jab at Biden regarding his oft-repeated ties to President Barack Obama. It worked in its way, especially with the crowd at Texas Southern University, a historically black school. But it didn't have nearly the bite of her June debate challenge to Biden for his opposition to busing for school integration in the 1970s. One thing Harris succeeded in doing was returning the debate, again and again, to the subject of Donald Trump. One after another, the candidates would acknowledge that beating Trump was everyone's ultimate goal, an existential necessity for the party and the overarching unifying element in this contest. Sen. Kamala Harris, tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang and former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke participate in the third Democratic primary debate on Thursday night.\n                \n                    \n                    Robyn Beck/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Sen. Kamala Harris, tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang and former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke participate in the third Democratic primary debate on Thursday night. Yet, curiously, not one candidate mentioned the impeachment debate currently raging within the House of Representatives, where most Democrats now want a formal impeachment proceeding but Speaker Nancy Pelosi does not \u2013 at least not yet. Neither did anyone in the debate mention the recession jitters that polls show many Americans feeling, if only because the length of the current expansion and indications it may be ending. That's important, because recessions beat incumbent presidents more often than the opposing party's nominee does. No incumbent lost between the Depression election of 1932 and 1976, when Democrat Jimmy Carter talked of an \"economic misery index\" in ousting Republican Gerald Ford. That same index was even worse when Ronald Reagan ousted Carter four years later. George H.W. Bush also lost as an incumbent in 1992, the victim of a brief recession and an independent candidate (Ross Perot) who got 19% of the popular vote. Since then, three incumbent presidents have been re-elected and none has lost, despite the efforts of well-known, well-financed and party-backed challengers (Robert Dole, John Kerry and Mitt Romney). That is largely why polls taken this week by CNN and by NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist found a plurality of Americans expect Trump to win a second term, even though far fewer think he deserves it. Trump's approval number is now among the lowest ever for presidents after 20 months in office. But some have come back from comparable low points, including Obama and Reagan (who came back to win 49 states). It's going to take more than good debate performances, and more than winning the nomination, for one of these Democratic contenders to defeat this incumbent. Only bad economics, or the actions of the incumbent himself, are likely to accomplish that. But to make themselves attractive as a reasonable option, the Democrats need to present coherent, clear alternatives in policy and persona. This week's debate was at least a longer step in that direction.",

            "article_content": "A review of the third Democratic presidential debate. How the candidates played off of one another, who shined and who didn't.  MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: Last night's Democratic presidential debate in Houston was always going to be different from the ones we've already watched. For one thing, only 10 candidates made the cut, which meant just one debate. Some things were the same, though, like ABC leaning into the fact that this Democratic field is the most diverse in age, race and gender. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JORGE RAMOS: We appreciate the opportunity to welcome Latinos across the country and to ask about Latinx issues. LINSEY DAVIS: We are delighted to be on the beautiful campus of Texas Southern University, one of the largest historically black colleges and universities in the country. KELLY: NPR's TV critic Eric Deggans was watching, as was political editor Domenico Montanaro, and they both have got some thoughts. DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: So, Eric, I mean, this debate was different in some ways, the same in some others. I mean, what'd you think? ERIC DEGGANS, BYLINE: Well, you know, it was long. (LAUGHTER) MONTANARO: Three hours - what are they doing? DEGGANS: But, you know, what was interesting to me was how it started because I was a little worried. We had Andrew Yang come up. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ANDREW YANG: I'm going to do something unprecedented tonight. DEGGANS: And his opening statement almost sounded like he was formulating his own lottery or game show. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) YANG: My campaign will now give a freedom dividend of $1,000 a month for an entire year to 10 American families. DEGGANS: To him and maybe to his supporters, it sounded revolutionary. But to me and, I think, some of the people that I saw on social media, it felt a little cheap, like he was making this whole debate into a game show of some kind. MONTANARO: Well, it's fascinating because the Democratic candidates on the stage also didn't treat it really seriously in the moment. Pete Buttigieg, the South Bend, Ind., mayor, just sort of side-eyed and dismissed what, you know, Yang's proposal was. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PETE BUTTIGIEG: It's original. I'll give you that. MONTANARO: I mean, aside from that moment, this was actually a pretty substantive debate - none of the sort of WWE-like hype that we'd seen in some of the others. DEGGANS: I agree. And what I thought was interesting was that ABC figured out a way to get the candidates to contrast themselves and their policy positions without looking like they were ginning up some kind of food fight. They were able to sort of say, you have X policy... (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DAVIS: Vice President Biden, you have a plan to release many nonviolent drug offenders from prison. DEGGANS: ...But so-and-so says that that won't work... (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DAVIS: Senator Booker says that your plan is not ambitious enough. Your response? DEGGANS: ...Can you explain yourself? Rather than trying to make the candidates criticize each other, they kept it about policy. I'm going to give my MVP award to Linsey Davis... MONTANARO: OK. DEGGANS: ...Who I thought asked the toughest questions of the night, especially to Kamala Harris about her record as a prosecutor... (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DAVIS: You used to oppose the legalization of marijuana; now you don't. You used to oppose outside investigations of police shootings; now you don't. DEGGANS: ...And to Joe Biden about comments that he had made 40 years ago insisting that people should not be responsible for things that their ancestors did. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DAVIS: But as you stand here tonight, what responsibility do you think that Americans need to take to repair the legacy of slavery in our country? DEGGANS: I will say I thought it was a little odd to segregate the questions to have the black woman ask questions about race and to have Jorge Ramos from Univision ask the questions about immigration. And the questions were so good. I see why they did that. But it still sort of communicated this idea, I think, that race is about black people and immigration is about Latinos. And maybe they should've spread those questions around a little more. MONTANARO: And politically, though, you know, the media narrative heading into the debate was all about Biden and Warren taking the stage together for the first time. Biden was far more aggressive than in previous debates. It was like he discovered Red Bull or something for - you know, you can take it, like, late at night. He, like, signaled that he was willing to go after Warren. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JOE BIDEN: I think we should have a debate on health care. I think I know that the senator says she's for Bernie. Well, I'm for Barack. I think the Obamacare worked. MONTANARO: But Warren, amazingly, came away unscathed. And, you know, Biden sounded like he was going to go after Warren, but, really, it was about Bernie Sanders, as you can hear there. And Warren was happy to just kind of let Sanders be something of a heat shield, and that was something that seemed to sort of irritate Bernie Sanders because he was sort of a man on an island for a little bit. And he went after the organization itself putting on the debate. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BERNIE SANDERS: Tonight on ABC, the health care industry will be advertising, telling you how bad \"Medicare for All\" is because they want to protect their profits. That is absurd. MONTANARO: He was getting irritated and decided to tear down the fourth wall and just talk to the audience rather than try to win over the moderators. DEGGANS: I would say that I saw some pundits after the debate was over say that this was the most clearly revelatory debate, where we really saw the temperament of these candidates. And we also saw their policy positions laid out in a way that you could follow, that you could understand, and you could compare the many against each other. And it didn't feel like I had sat through a three-hour debate, although, you know, I was ready for it to be over when it ended. MONTANARO: You know, and there's less than five months to go before the first votes are cast. And the next October debate, unfortunately, Eric, we've got to watch two because Tom Steyer, the billionaire venture capitalist - he qualified for the October debate already. So that means 11 candidates, means they're going to be broken up over two nights. DEGGANS: Well, I'm going to have my Red Bull ready. MONTANARO: Yeah, there you go. DEGGANS: I'll be right in front of my keyboard and my TV watching. I'm sure you will be, too. MONTANARO: Oh, yeah. KELLY: Oh, yeah. That's NPR political editor Domenico Montanaro and NPR's TV critic Eric Deggans. (SOUNDBITE OF EL JAZZY CHAVO'S \"NO FLOWERS AT MY BALCONY\") Copyright \u00a9 2019 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Bernie Sanders, former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren participate in the third Democratic primary debate of the 2020 presidential campaign season. The fate of the filibuster \u2014 a 60-vote threshold for most legislation in the U.S. Senate \u2014 is again an issue of controversy among Democratic presidential candidates. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren said the supermajority requirement is preventing Congress from passing popular bills \u2014 such as a background check bill. \"We have a Congress that is beholden to the gun industry,\" said Warren during Thursday night's debate. \"And unless we're willing to address that head-on and roll back the filibuster, we're not going to get anything done on guns. I was in the United States Senate when 54 senators said, 'Let's do background checks;  let's get rid of assault weapons,' and with 54 senators, it failed because of the filibuster.\" Speaking immediately after her, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont rejected ending the filibuster but also said he would \"not wait for 60 votes\" to pass priorities of his, such as \"Medicare for All\" or climate change legislation. Instead, he suggested existing parliamentary tactics to get bills through Congress without being filibustered. But Warren's argument is one that many liberals have become attuned to after seeing how effectively now-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell wielded the filibuster when he was minority leader during much of Barack Obama's presidency. Many progressive activists fear that a lot of the ideas Democrats have been debating won't actually become law if a Democrat becomes president in 2021 unless the party either has 60 of the Senate's 100 seats, an impossibly tall order, or changes the chamber's rules to make it easier to pass bills without the cooperation of the other party. Here's how NPR's Ron Elving explained the filibuster in 2017: \"The filibuster used to be a rare and powerful tool for lawmakers to use when they wanted to hold up the normal course of business. But as rules changed to require fewer votes to shut one down, senators began to invoke it as a regular threat. Now, there are even fewer circumstances where it can be used.\" In the modern era, the filibuster has been used at record rates, making almost nothing passable without 60 votes. As NPR reported in 2017: \"There were a record number of cloture motions filed during the Obama years when the GOP was in the minority. (Cloture motions are essentially what's used to end debate, which takes 60 votes, or stop a filibuster.)\" A number of Democratic presidential candidates want to get rid of the filibuster (although Warren is the only senator who embraces the idea). And it's a rare idea that President Trump agrees with them on, having experienced his own frustrations trying to get bills through Congress only to see them die in the Senate despite receiving majority support. The U.S. Senate should switch to 51 votes, immediately, and get Healthcare and TAX CUTS approved, fast and easy. Dems would do it, no doubt! But many long-serving lawmakers disagree, warning that a no-holds-barred approach would take hold in the Senate and that the minority could block nothing, even things the party finds odious. Delaware Sen. Chris Coons told NPR in March that it's not about Senate power \u2014 it's about giving minority parties protection and encouraging bipartisanship. \"It's a terrible idea,\" said Coons, who has long defended the filibuster. \"Democrats would reap the whirlwind almost immediately.\"",

Once again, there were fights over costs, coverage and whether the party is growing too extreme. But this time, all of the front-runners were onstage together, providing the first opportunity for all of them to take direct aim at each other and their vastly differing health care plans. It made for some heated exchanges, putting \"Medicare for All\" supporters on defense. But it also showed clearly that some candidates are cautious not to criticize others' proposals too harshly. Thursday night's debate featured two stalwart supporters of the single-payer \"Medicare for All\" health care plan: Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who introduced the bill, and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, one of the bill's co-sponsors. And from the start, former Vice President Joe Biden came out swinging at them. \"How are we going to pay for it? I want to hear tonight how that's happening,\" he said, making the case that his public option proposal would cost less. One of the main arguments against \"Medicare for All\" is that it would mean much higher government spending. Supporters counter that it would lead to overall less health care spending than the current system. (Studies have been mixed on this question of whether costs would be higher or lower.) What would change, they argue, is that the spending would be done by the government, with taxpayer dollars, rather than via copays and premiums, for example. Warren drove at this point when moderator George Stephanopoulos asked about the potential for higher taxes for everyday Americans. In her answer, she did not give a flat yes or no \u2014 and avoided giving an endlessly sound-bite-able answer about the potential for higher taxes for everyday Americans. \"Instead of paying premiums into insurance companies and then having insurance companies build their profits by saying no to coverage, we are going to do this by saying everyone is covered by 'Medicare for All,' every health care provider is covered,\" she said. \"And the only question here in terms of difference is where to send the bill.\" There are also many Democrats, such as Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who stress that \"Medicare for All\" would virtually eliminate private insurance. \"While Bernie wrote the bill, I read the bill,\" she said. \"And on Page 8 of the bill, it says that we will no longer have private insurance as we know it. And that means that 149 million Americans will no longer be able to have their current insurance in four years.\" Polling has shown that many Americans don't understand that private insurance would largely disappear under \"Medicare for All\"; polling has also shown that the idea of eliminating private insurance makes the plan much less popular. Altogether, eight candidates on Thursday's stage support either a public option or some other sort of overhaul that would still maintain a substantial role for private insurance. Polling shows that a public option is far more popular than single-payer health care. A July NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll found that 90% of Democrats, as well as 70% of all adults, support a public option. Meanwhile, 64% of Democrats (and 41% of all adults) support \"Medicare for All.\" That's less support, but still a majority of Democrats support Sanders' single-payer plan, some of them passionately. Perhaps with that in mind, even candidates who support other plans refrained from attacking the proposal \u2014 or its author \u2014 too hard. For example, while Klobuchar slammed \"Medicare for All,\" she made sure to praise Sanders himself for working with her on trying to bring down prescription drug prices. California Sen. Kamala Harris, who co-sponsored Sanders' bill, sold her plan as a \" 'Medicare for All' plan,\" though it is substantially different from what Sanders has proposed. (It would, for example, retain a significant role for private insurance.) She also took care to praise Sanders, even while she supports a different plan. \"I want to give credit to Bernie,\" she said. \"Take credit, Bernie. You know, you brought us this far in 'Medicare for All.' \" New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, who also co-sponsored Sanders' plan, said Thursday, \"I believe in 'Medicare for All,' \" but he also proposed a more incremental approach. Indeed, in past debates, when asked, he did not indicate that he would be willing to get rid of private insurance, which Sanders' bill would largely do. In responding to Biden's attacks, Warren made sure to praise former President Barack Obama, saying, \"We all owe huge debt to President Obama\" for the Affordable Care Act. Likewise, Biden hugged Obama tightly in promoting his own plan, saying that it would build on Obamacare. Obamacare is popular among Democrats \u2014 84% have a favorable view of it \u2014 and it has grown in popularity among all Americans since Donald Trump's election. However, all Democrats in this field agree that it needs an overhaul. The balancing act that many are trying to do is pushing their own plans without slamming others' too hard.",

            "article_content": "Democratic candidates debate tonight, with the top contenders all on one stage. Issues from healthcare and foreign policy, to who is best positioned to beat President Trump, divide the field.  AILSA CHANG, HOST: The Democratic presidential candidates are debating again tonight. And, this time, it's going to be different. The DNC made it harder to get into the debate. Only half of the field qualified this time. So instead of two nights, there is just one. And that means all of the top candidates are finally on the same stage together. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Senator Cory Booker. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Congressman O'Rourke. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Senator Kamala Harris. DON LEMON: Senator Warren, please respond. JAKE TAPPER: Senator Klobuchar? UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Thank you, Vice President Biden. TAPPER: Mr. Yang, I want to bring you in. You said... I want to bring in Mayor Buttigieg. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Secretary Julian Castro. TAPPER: And, Senator Sanders, let's start with you. CHANG: So we wanted to take a look at the arguments we're likely going to be hearing tonight among the Democratic contenders. And to do that, we're joined now by NPR's Asma Khalid and Scott Detrow, who are now in Houston, where the debate is being held. Hey, guys. SCOTT DETROW, BYLINE: Hello. ASMA KHALID, BYLINE: Hey there. CHANG: All right, Scott. Let's start with you. Heading into this debate, what do you think is the biggest disagreement the candidates are having? Where are we going to see some fireworks, you think? DETROW: You know, I think there are going to be a whole range of policy disagreements tonight. But, probably, the biggest disagreement among the candidates is going to be a political one, and that's about this notion of electability. Electability - this term that we talk about, you talk about, voters talk about, most importantly - more. Over and over again, voters say that they want a nominee who can beat Donald Trump. And that's what they care about. It's a murky thing. It's a subjective thing. But Joe Biden's campaign has embraced this idea in campaigns, saying that he is the best person positioned to beat Trump. And as that has continued and as Biden has remained in the lead in the polls, there has been increased frustration from other candidates who are pushing back on this idea. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE) JULIAN CASTRO: We're not going to win by just trying to be safe. We're going to win by being bold. CORY BOOKER: We can't make the mistake that says, oh, we've got to play it safe. This election is just about finding somebody who can beat Donald Trump. ELIZABETH WARREN: And people are scared. But we can't choose a candidate we don't believe in because we're scared. DETROW: And that was Julian Castro, Cory Booker and Elizabeth Warren there. Biden's campaign argues that this is not the only reason that people are gravitating towards Joe Biden right now. It's his long track record as vice president. But I'll say this is something that Asma and I hear from voters all the time when they talk about why they're currently supporting or thinking of supporting Joe Biden. CHANG: One thing we're going to be watching tonight - there's going to be a lot of progressives onstage - not as many of the more centrist moderates. But we've been hearing the progressives push this idea of \"Medicare for All\" for months now. So with tonight's mix of candidates onstage, what do we expect the health care conversation to sound like, Asma? KHALID: Even amongst the so-called progressives, there's a lot of nuance about what a Medicare for All plan should look like. There's not unanimous agreement about that definition, about that idea. I want you to take a listen to South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg. Here he was over the weekend at the New Hampshire State Convention. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PETE BUTTIGIEG: We ought to unify Americans around these solutions, or nothing will actually get done. That's why my health care vision is Medicare for All who want it. KHALID: Ailsa, did you get that? It's Medicare for All who want it. CHANG: Want it (laughter). KHALID: So what he's saying is that, you know, he is not advocating for an extreme elimination of all private insurance. CHANG: Yeah. KHALID: There would be still choice left in his system. You know, when you're talking about a true Medicare for All plan that would eliminate private insurance, really, the only two candidates onstage tonight who have explicitly endorsed such a plan are Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders and Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren. CHANG: We also expect racial justice to be a big topic for Democratic voters. And, I mean, maybe one of the biggest moments in the last debate was when Kamala Harris confronted Joe Biden over busing desegregation. That was just a few months ago. Has the conversation on racial issues changed any? DETROW: This is an area where a lot of the candidates are moving in the same direction. And even there - if there's a difference of degrees, they all basically want to do a lot of the same things. California Senator Kamala Harris is one of the most recent candidates to come out with a plan. And hers included a lot of ideas that you've seen in many other plans, things like doing away with mandatory minimum sentences, doing away with private prisons, putting in place a national use-of-force standard for police. This is, politically, also another area where candidates have - and likely will again this evening - gone after Biden for his long career. He took a lead role in the tough-on-crime trends of the '90s. That's something that many Democratic voters, especially younger voters - younger black voters, in particular - think the party was just dead wrong on two decades ago. Biden has defended a lot of those votes, particularly pointing to the assault weapons ban that was part of that 1994 crime bill. CHANG: Well, another way Biden has been defending himself is he says his foreign policy credentials give him this huge advantage over the other candidates. But I understand there's a lot of disagreement about his record, right? So do you expect to hear about that tonight, Asma? KHALID: Ailsa, I would anticipate we will hear somewhat about that. But, you know, the criticism on Biden's record is that even though he has a lot of experience, his critics will say that his judgment has been off on some key decisions, such as the Iraq War. Recently, in an interview with us on the NPR Politics Podcast, he defended his vote to authorize the war. He said that President Bush just needed that authorization as sort of - some sort of diplomatic leverage. Here's what he said. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST) JOE BIDEN: Immediately, the moment it started, I came out against the war at that moment. KHALID: And, Ailsa, that's not exactly true, you know? It actually took him about two years to publicly admit that that vote was a mistake. Biden made nearly the same argument in the last debate. But now one of his campaign advisers has said that he misspoke, so I am very curious to see how he will defend that record tonight. CHANG: That's NPR's Scott Detrow and Asma Khalid. Thanks, guys. KHALID: You're welcome. DETROW: Sure thing. Copyright \u00a9 2019 NPR.  All rights reserved.  Visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.

            "article_content": "The final contest of the 2018 midterms is being decided Tuesday in North Carolina. The original election was close, and the results were thrown out amid evidence of vote tampering by a GOP operative.  MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: Voters in North Carolina are deciding the final race from the 2018 midterms tomorrow. That's right - the 2018 midterms. The original returns from last November were very close, but those results were thrown out after an investigation uncovered possible vote tampering by a Republican operative, which brings us to tomorrow's race. That's between Republican Dan Bishop and Democrat Dan McCready. It is neck and neck, and it's being seen as a preview of what is to come in 2020. Tonight President Trump is campaigning there to help Republicans hold on. Well, NPR political reporter Jessica Taylor is following all this. She's in the studio. Hi, there. JESSICA TAYLOR, BYLINE: Hi, Mary Louise. KELLY: All right, so we're talking - this is the ninth district in North Carolina - big district, traditional GOP district. It does not include the city of Charlotte, but it does include a lot of Charlotte suburbs, which is a big deal because it was in the suburbs of big cities where the election was won and lost for Republicans last year. Is that why this district is so competitive again? TAYLOR: Yes. Now, President Trump won this district by 12 points in 2016, and Republicans have held this district for more than 50 years, but Democrats are zeroing in again on those fast-growing Charlotte suburbs to try to boost turnout. But Republicans, they need to focus on the more rural areas of the district. That's why you see President Trump going there to try to boost his supporters, many of whom stayed home last time, to show how important this is. And so there's sort of a one-two punch happening today. Vice President Mike Pence campaigned just outside of Charlotte in the district's most conservative area, and then Trump tonight is in Fayetteville on the other side of the district. But it's a very conservative area, a very military-heavy district, and this is really where they need to boost turnout. KELLY: All right, talk to me about the candidates. We know they're both named Dan. What else should we know about them? TAYLOR: Democrat Dan McCready, he's a Marine Corps veteran, and he's been running for two years now. He's run a centrist campaign, like a lot of other Democrats successfully did in 2018. He's emphasizing health care and pocketbook issues, and he doesn't want to talk about other liberal issues like Medicare for all and the Green New Deal. He lost by just 905 votes last year, and the Republican whose victory was thrown out decided not to run again in the do-over election. So you have Dan Bishop running. He's a state senator, and he's perhaps best known for authoring the state's controversial so-called bathroom bill that mandated people to use the restroom of their gender that they were assigned at birth. But Democrats aren't even really hitting him on this. They're going after him over his votes against expanding Medicaid and a vote against cutting prescription drug costs. Now, he does come from the Charlotte area, and he did actually win in a very tough climate in 2018, but Bishop, he's running in the kind of campaign that House Republicans have already signaled they're going to run in 2020 - tying Democrats as closely to socialism as they can and tying themselves very close to President Trump. You know, his ads have already invoked people like the squad - New York Congresswoman Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez and Minnesota Congresswoman Ilhan Omar. KELLY: And should we gather from the fact that the president is there tonight that this is a very important race for Republicans? TAYLOR: Yes. Republicans cannot afford a loss in this red of a seat. There are only four Democrats currently in the House who represent a more conservative seat than this one. That's why you've seen Republicans pour more than $6 million in this seat to try to save it. KELLY: NPR's Jessica Taylor, thank you. TAYLOR: Thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2019 NPR.  All rights reserved.

But they acknowledge that it could also come with some significant short-term costs.

While many Capitol Hill Republicans would like to avoid another public debate about whether to repeal the Affordable Care Act, President Trump and his appointees keep bringing it up \u2014 promising their own health plan that would be \"phenomenal\" and make the GOP \"the party of health care.\" \"We're actively engaged in conversations\" on what to do, Medicare chief Seema Verma said last month. And Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway has indicated a health care announcement might come in September. Behind the pronouncements lies a dilemma: whether or not to stray beyond efforts underway to improve the nation's health care system \u2014 loosening insurance regulations, talking about drug prices and expanding tax-free health savings accounts \u2014 to develop an overarching plan. For the White House, it's a fraught decision. A comprehensive plan could serve as a lightning rod for opponents. Conversely, not having a plan for replacing some of the most popular parts of Obamacare \u2014 such as its coverage protections for people with preexisting medical conditions \u2014 could leave the GOP flatfooted if an administration-supported lawsuit now before the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals were to invalidate the sweeping health law. \"This is a real conundrum,\" says Dean Rosen, a Washington, D.C., health policy consultant who often advises Republicans. \"There is a risk with action or inaction.\" No matter how the 5th Circuit rules, its decision, which could come soon, is likely to be stayed while the issue heads to the Supreme Court. Such a delay would give the Trump administration time to flesh out a proposal if the appeals judges throw out the ACA. But it would also ensure that a health care debate is front and center during the presidential campaign. Right now, polls show the public is focused on health costs, says professor Robert Blendon, director of the Harvard Opinion Research Program, which studies public knowledge of health care and policy issues. Consumers are concerned about what they pay at the pharmacy counter or about the sum of their insurance premiums and deductibles. \"Most voters are not interested in another debate on a new health plan,\" Blendon says. But if the 5th Circuit upholds a Texas ruling overturning the entire ACA, \"that changes the entire framework,\" he adds. \"The administration could not just say, 'Oh, we'll have something great.' They would have to have something outlined.\" Supporters and critics say likely elements are already in plain sight, both in executive actions and proposals in the president's budget as well as in a little-noticed interagency white paper released late last year, called \"Reforming American's Health Care System Through Choice And Competition.\" The president has won praise both from conservatives and from liberals for initiatives such as his proposal to require hospitals to post their actual, negotiated prices and some strategies to lower drug prices. But legal battles from industry could thwart such initiatives. On these topics, \"a lot of what they've proposed has been pretty smart,\" says Shawn Gremminger, senior director of federal relations at the liberal Families USA advocacy group. Still, Gremminger points to other administration actions \u2014 such as loosening rules on health insurers to allow sales of what critics call \"junk\" insurance policies, because they don't have all the consumer protections of ACA policies, or promoting work requirements for Medicaid recipients \u2014 as strong hints to what might be in any eventual election-related plan. \"I think what we'll see is a lot of that same sort of stuff, warmed over and put into a new package,\" Gremminger says. \"We fully expect it will include a lot of really terrible ideas.\" For other policy clues, some Trump advisers, like Brian Blase, a former special assistant to the president at the National Economic Council now with the Texas Public Policy Foundation, say look no further than that 2018 interagency report. The 114-page document, a joint publication of the U.S. departments of Labor, Treasury and Health and Human Services, includes more than two dozen recommendations that broadly focus on loosening federal and state regulations, limiting hospital and insurer market power and prompting patients to be more price-conscious shoppers. Many are long-standing, free market favorites of Republicans, such as increasing the use of health savings accounts \u2014 which allow consumers to set aside money, tax-free, to cover medical expenses. Other ideas are not typically associated with the GOP, such as increased federal scrutiny of mergers of hospitals and insurers; such mergers have driven up prices. The white paper also calls for easing restrictions on Medicare Advantage plans, which offer an alternative to the traditional fee-for-service Medicare. The Trump proposal would allow the advantage program to have smaller networks of doctors and hospitals \u2014 presumably ones that agreed to charge less. \"The administration knows where it is going on health care,\" Blase says. If the court strikes down the ACA, he expects the administration to release a plan supporting \"generously funded, state-based high-risk pools.\" Such pools existed in most states before the ACA. They helped provide coverage for people with preexisting conditions who were denied policies by insurers. But the pools were expensive, so they often were underfunded \u2014 capping members' benefits and producing long waiting lists. Not everyone thinks the white paper is a plan, but more of a \"combination of policy ideas and political statements,\" says Joe Antos at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute. Still, he doubts the GOP needs a comprehensive health proposal. Republicans are more likely to gain politically by merely attacking the Democrats' ideas, Antos says, especially if the Democratic nominee backs proposals for a fully government-funded health care system, such as the \"Medicare for All\" plans some candidates support. Republicans will \"have their own one-liners, saying they are dedicated to protecting people with preexisting conditions. That might be enough for a lot of people,\" Antos says. Politically, taking on the Affordable Care Act \u2014 or not taking it on \u2014 are both risky. While many voters don't understand all that the federal health law does, some of its rules enjoy broad support. That's particularly true of the protections for people with medical problems \u2014 under the current law, insurers are barred from rejecting them for coverage or charging them more than people without such conditions. The Republican effort to repeal the ACA galvanized activists during the 2018 midterm elections and is credited with boosting Democrats to victory in many House districts. Analysts on both sides expect concerns about health costs and health law to play a large role again in 2020. For Republicans, \"the risk of doing nothing potentially leaves no port in a storm if the ACA is overturned legally,\" Rosen says. \"But a more limited version, which is what most Republicans are for, is likely to be met with the same concerns. No matter what the president says, it won't be enough for the Democrats.\" Opinion poll analyst Blendon says there is an additional unknown: Which Democrat will win the nomination \u2014 and what type of coverage will she or he back? Even as the GOP is split on how to address health care concerns, so too are the Democrats. \"If they are reading the same polling data as I am, they would have serious proposals for lowering drug and hospital costs, but not offer a national health plan,\" Blendon says. The Democrats' most progressive wing, led by Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, wants Medicare for All, which would essentially eliminate private and job-based coverage. Recent polls have shown voters are not keen on losing private insurance. The party's center, led by former Vice President Joe Biden, wants to keep the ACA but apply \"fixes\" to make insurance purchased by individuals more affordable. \"If the Democratic nominee is running on keeping the ACA, the Republican will have to have an alternative,\" Blendon says. But if the nominee supports Medicare for All, Blendon predicts simply a GOP \"anti-campaign\" targeting the Democrat's idea as unworkable, socialist or a danger to Medicare.

            "article_content": "Ten Democratic candidates have qualified for the next debate as the fundraising and polling benchmarks doubled. That's hastened exits from the race for several candidates, as others defiantly go on.  AILSA CHANG, HOST: All right. Now to the 2020 campaign. The historically large field of Democratic presidential candidates has dwindled. There are just 20 left at this point, and only half of them will be on the debate stage next month in Houston. The DNC made that lineup official today. And we wanted to look at how that could change the race, so we brought in NPR political correspondent Scott Detrow. Hey, Scott. SCOTT DETROW, BYLINE: Hey, there. CHANG: All right. So it's official now. We're down to 10 candidates for the next debate. Who's in? DETROW: So this is an important clarification. It's a smaller overall field, but it is still a very crowded... CHANG: Yes. DETROW: ...Debate stage with 10 candidates on it. Joe Biden will be at the center - a lot of polls recently showing that he continues to hold a commanding lead. This will be the first time he's on the stage with Senator Elizabeth Warren, who's increasingly a top rival. Senator Bernie Sanders will be onstage as well. We'll also have three other senators - Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar and Cory Booker - as well as Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Julian Castro, Beto O'Rourke and Andrew Yang. CHANG: All right - so still a whole slew of candidates. And looking at this particular group, what do you think? Will we see a really different debate next month from what we saw earlier in the summer? DETROW: One thing we'll see is a longer debate. This is going to be a three-hour-long debate... CHANG: Oh, lovely. DETROW: ...Just announced. You know, one of the big features of the first two rounds is that lower-polling moderates ended up with a lot of airtime as they argued against big progressive policies from Sanders and Warren. A lot of them did not make the cut here. So expect Joe Biden to be front and center in debates like that. You know, do you build on Obamacare, or do you push for \"Medicare for All?\" How do you enforce immigration? - other moderate-progressive splits. Amy Klobuchar is also in that centrist lane, and she'll be on the stage. But I think Biden and Warren, you know, particularly will be asked a lot of she-says-this-you-said-this-type... CHANG: Right. DETROW: ...Questions. It's also worth flagging that Biden and Warren have had years and years of policy disagreements with each other, going back to when he was a senator and she was a professor arguing for more consumer-friendly bankruptcy law. So I'm very curious to see how they interact with each other, what they say about each other. CHANG: OK. So over the last few weeks, we saw a bunch of candidates drop out. The latest was Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York. Did these candidates drop out just because they weren't going to qualify for the debate? DETROW: Yeah, and they were pretty clear about that. There was a weird dynamic here where they were trying really hard at the last minute to meet these qualifying standards, including having 130,000 individual donors. So they were aggressively trying to raise money. And so they went from, please give me money for my campaign, to suddenly exiting the race. I was curious how people felt who gave the money in those... CHANG: Yeah. Yeah. DETROW: ...Final days. I tracked down several, including Margaret de Vico (ph) from New Jersey. MARGARET DE VICO: I was definitely sad that she dropped out. But I mean, she can have my five bucks. That's fine. I wasn't angry. I'm just bummed that she won't be there. I thought that it was just really important for her to be able to have the platform to talk about the issues that are important to her. DETROW: So she had obviously contributed to Gillibrand's campaign. But you know, one thing from talking to a lot of people in a situation like that - to me, it really illustrated how pragmatically so many Democratic voters are treating this race. The general consensus was, people said, yeah, I understand why the DNC has this rules. I think it's better to have fewer candidates, even though the one I liked left the race. And hey, I still have a lot of candidates I'm interested in and could see myself voting for. CHANG: Still a lot of options. DETROW: Yep. CHANG: OK. So there are 10 candidates who did not make this debate, but they're still running, right? So what's ahead for them? DETROW: Well, the debate in October will have the same rules, and they'll have one more month to qualify, whether that's increasing the number of donors or hitting 2% in enough polls. Candidates like billionaire activist Tom Steyer and Hawaii Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard came pretty close. The - Steyer needs one more poll. Gabbard needs two. Steyer in particular is spending a ton of money in early states, trying to raise his name ID. So he has a good chance of qualifying for October. And you know what that means - back to two nights of debates. CHANG: Oh, boy. That's NPR's Scott Detrow. Thanks, Scott. DETROW: Thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2019 NPR.  All rights reserved.

John Hickenlooper speaks during a forum in Miami in June. Former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper dropped his bid for president Thursday. \"Today, I'm ending my campaign for president. But I will never stop believing that America can only move forward when we work together,\" Hickenlooper tweeted. He had been urged to run for Senate in Colorado, challenging Sen. Cory Gardner. In a video attached to his tweet, he said he would give that \"serious thought\" but made no announcement. As a presidential candidate, Hickenlooper had painted himself as a relative centrist in the crowded, mostly progressive presidential field of more than 20 candidates. But he wasn't able to gain much traction. He had not met the polling or fundraising requirements to participate in the September debate. This morning, I\u2019m announcing that I\u2019m no longer running for President. While this campaign didn\u2019t have the outcome we were hoping for, every moment has been worthwhile & I\u2019m thankful to everyone who supported this campaign and our entire team.https://t.co/1ijSjkbzzd Earlier Thursday, former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke recast his campaign as one that will more forcefully take on President Trump. O'Rourke, who has qualified for the September debate, has also struggled and is now relaunching his campaign for the second time. After taking some time off from the campaign trail after a mass shooting in his hometown of El Paso killed 22 people, O'Rourke now says the renewed focus of his campaign will be about \"taking the fight to Donald Trump.\" O'Rourke called the president \"the greatest threat to this country, bar none.\" Democratic presidential candidate former Rep. Beto O'Rourke of Texas relaunches his campaign from his hometown of El Paso after a mass shooting that killed nearly two dozen people there.\n                \n                    \n                    Sandy Huffaker/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Democratic presidential candidate former Rep. Beto O'Rourke of Texas relaunches his campaign from his hometown of El Paso after a mass shooting that killed nearly two dozen people there. Speaking from a rooftop overlooking El Paso, O'Rourke said, \"I don't know that I've been doing a good enough job to match that threat with the urgency and the honesty and the clarity that it deserves.\" The Houston Chronicle wrote an editorial earlier this week urging O'Rourke to drop out of the presidential race and return to Texas to challenge incumbent Republican Sen. John Cornyn. But O'Rourke never entertained that idea, said Lauren Hitt, O'Rourke's national director of rapid response. Hitt called the editorial \"frustrating\" and said O'Rourke \"has no intent\" of dropping out. What's more, the \"honest reality is it's really hard for Beto or anyone else to take back the Senate [seat] if Trump wins by 9 points in Texas again.\" \"No Democrat \u2014 Jesus reincarnated is not going to win Texas with Trump at the top of the ballot in Texas\" and if Trump were to win by 9 again. It's just too big of a swing needed, Hitt pointed out. O'Rourke, she said, believes the best way to beat Trump in Texas, of course, is for him to be at the top of the ticket. Saying goodbye to a 'pragmatic' candidate On the debate stage in July, Hickenlooper spoke less than any other candidate on the first night of that round, but he tried to position himself as a foil to the progressive front-runners, especially Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. \"Now, I share their progressive values, but I'm a little more pragmatic,\" he said. He added that he doesn't think \"massive government expansions\" are a good idea and argued that being moderate is the sure way to beat Trump in states he won in 2016. Drawing lines between progressives on stage, Hickenlooper did not support Medicare for All and called the proposed Green New Deal, which would aggressively address climate change, a \"disaster at the ballot box.\" It's so risky, he argued, that Democrats who support it \"might as well FedEx the election to Donald Trump.\" A former petroleum geologist, he has been a strong supporter of Colorado's gas and oil industry. In June, he was booed by California Democrats for saying, \"If we want to beat Donald Trump and achieve big, progressive goals, socialism is not the answer.\" Speaking to NPR in February, he said Democrats would also need more than deep anger at Trump to win in 2020. \"I think there might be a kind of a new silent majority,\" he said, \"of people that are also going to want to see achievement.\" Some leading Democrats, including New York Sen. Chuck Schumer, urged Hickenlooper to forgo a presidential bid and instead run against Republican Gardner of Colorado, who is considered one of the top targets of Democrats working to regain control of the Senate. Recent polls showed Hickenlooper ahead of Gardner. Even as he was still campaigning for president, one of his aides said the former governor was not foreclosing a run for the Senate. Hickenlooper is also a former mayor of Denver and a successful beer brewer. When he announced his bid in March, he touted growing the state's economy, expanding Medicaid and enacting gun restrictions in his two terms as Colorado's governor. \"Standing tall when it matters,\" he said, \"is one of the things that really drives me.\"",

Bernie Sanders (left) gestures while former Colorado governor John Hickenlooper (right) speaks during the Democratic Presidential Debate at the Fox Theatre in Detroit, Michigan. Ideological lines were drawn early and often during Tuesday night's presidential primary debate between the progressive and moderate wings of the Democratic Party. It was the clearest delineation yet this primary season, with centrist candidates such as former Maryland Rep. John Delaney, former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper and Montana Gov. Steve Bullock making arguments similar to those that Republicans have made \u2014 that many of the liberal policies Democrats such as Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren have championed on health care and taxes could ensure a second term for President Trump. \"Let's not kid ourselves \u2014 [Trump] will be tough to beat,\" Bullock said in his debate debut, cautioning against \"wish-list economics\" to create liberal policies, including \"Medicare for All,\" which dominated the start of the debate and was perhaps the biggest touchstone issue illuminating differences within the field. Delaney \u2014 a former backbench, wealthy congressman who has generated little buzz for his campaign despite running the longest \u2014 tried to draw historical parallels in warning that a nominee too far to the left would doom the chances of Democrats. He compared the duo of Sanders and Warren to George McGovern in 1972, Walter Mondale in 1984 and Michael Dukakis in 1988 \u2014 all of whom were crushed by their Republican opponents in presidential elections. \"Democrats win when we run on real solutions, not impossible promises,\" Delaney argued. \"I don't understand why anybody goes to all the trouble of running for president of the United States just to talk about what we really can't do and shouldn't fight for,\" Warren fired back. \"I don't get it.\" Why would anyone go through all the trouble of running for President just to get up on stage and talk about what\u2019s not possible? @ewarren is ready to fight. pic.twitter.com/fxHTGp78IG Warren also pushed back as other candidates challenged her and Sanders' support for Medicare for All, which would replace private health insurance:  \"We're not going to solve the urgent problems that we face with small ideas and spinelessness.\" The fireworks, which started immediately, shouldn't be that surprising, given that Warren and Sanders were at center stage and that the lower-polling candidates, who need to generate momentum to even make the September debate, had to ding the top-tier hopefuls somehow. The two friends and ideological equals have had a d\u00e9tente of sorts throughout the campaign, and that helped them take a sort of tag-team approach against more moderate candidates on the edges of the stage. Warren took a more measured, reasoned approach, while Sanders showed more outrage, throwing his hands up in disgust during one exchange with Hickenlooper. But the two never went after each other. At one point, when Sanders accidentally interrupted Warren, he stopped himself and apologized \u2014 a courtesy he didn't afford other opponents. Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan also took issue with Sanders' Medicare for All bill, claiming that it wouldn't help union members and senior citizens. \"I do know it. I wrote the damn bill,\" Sanders shot back when the two tussled over the details. Sanders took much of the friendly fire from his fellow competitors, while Warren tried to make more nuanced arguments with personal details and examples. In his closing statement, Hickenlooper echoed the sentiments of his more centrist colleagues in a different way, arguing that \"I'm as progressive as anybody up on this stage, but I'm pragmatic.\" South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who hasn't fit neatly into either camp, argued that Republicans were going to paint Democrats with a broad brush anyway, so they should just choose what is best for America, regardless of political implications. \"If we embrace a far-left agenda, they're going to say we're a bunch of crazy socialists. If we embrace a conservative agenda, they're going to say we're a bunch of crazy socialists. So let's stand up for the right policy, go up there and defend it,\" Buttigieg said.",

            "article_content": "Progressives Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren will be center stage at the Democratic presidential debate on Tuesday. Moderates on stage may push back to give a more centrist vision of the party.  AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: Bernie Sanders became a leading hero of the left in 2016. Back then, he was running for president on a platform far more sweeping than other Democrats, like Hillary Clinton. In the 2020 campaign, he's got company - perhaps none closer than Elizabeth Warren. Tonight, voters get to see both of these progressive candidates in direct contrast, side by side, at the second Democratic presidential debate in Detroit. NPR political correspondent Asma Khalid is here. Hey there, Asma. ASMA KHALID, BYLINE: Hey. CORNISH: And we also have NPR lead political editor Domenico Montanaro. Hey there, Domenico. Can you hear me? DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Hey there, Audie. CORNISH: So I just mentioned Warren and Sanders. Who else is onstage tonight, Domenico? MONTANARO: You've got South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, former Congressman Beto O'Rourke from Texas, Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, former Governor John Hickenlooper of Colorado, Governor Steve Bullock of Montana, Congressman Tim Ryan of Ohio, former Congressman John Delaney of Maryland and, finally, spiritualist and author Marianne Williamson - so a crowded pack of candidates, certainly. And a couple notes about the field is the first time in the lineup for Bullock, who believes Democrats need to appeal to conservative and rural voters. And you'll notice that - by random draw that we've got - even though the most diverse field in history for Democrats, there will be no candidates of color onstage tonight. And how they talk about race is going to be really interesting, considering President Trump continues to put race at the center of the national conversation. CORNISH: Right. And it actually came up in the first debate for these Democrats, right? Asma, you've been out on the campaign trail. How have the candidates been handling racial issues? KHALID: I would say they were talking about race and racial justice rather explicitly when it comes to specific public policy proposals they're putting forth, you know, whether that is more money for historically black colleges or more money for minority entrepreneurs. But it's also in their rhetoric. And part of this is, you know, no doubt because of the conversation that President Trump has created. But I will say we're hearing this, you know, when they're speaking to audiences like the NAACP or the Urban League, but you also get the sense, when you look at surveys, that this is something increasingly more that white voters in the Democratic Party also want to hear about. CORNISH: Asma, I also want to ask you specifically about Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. As we mentioned, this is the first time we're going to see them kind of side by side in this format. What might voters learn about the differences between them? KHALID: Well, their positions on a whole host of issues are rather similar, whether we're talking about \"Medicare for All\" or affordable college. I would say that stylistically will be the big thing that we'll see the difference of. Bernie Sanders has a tendency to speak in somewhat lofty theoretical goals, and Elizabeth Warren does tend to offer a little bit more specifics. You know, when she'll talk about affordable housing, she'll talk about the fact that she wants, say, 3.2 million more housing units. I think that's the big difference we'll see - is style and what voters prefer because when we talk about policies, there's a lot of similarities. MONTANARO: And the question, really, is with both of them - is just how far they would go. You know, the ideological split here is that Sanders is fine taking on the moniker of being a democratic socialist. Warren will say she's a capitalist. She wants big structural change for the economy. But overall, this is going to highlight how the progressives are tugging at the center of the party and moving it left. CORNISH: Is there going to be some pushback on that front? You've got former Vice President Joe Biden not on this stage tonight. So what might this look like? MONTANARO: Yeah. I mean, you could see some of those moderates, like Klobuchar or Hickenlooper or Bullock, take their shots at what they see as too liberal for a direction of the party. And Klobuchar, after the last debate, in fact, said that she'd pulled her punches because it was the first debate. And I bet that won't happen again tonight. CORNISH: Asma, finally, I just want to ask you about how much of a shadow you think Joe Biden will cast over this first round of the debate. KHALID: Well, I'm really interested to see that because though he will not be on the stage, I think everyone is very clear about the momentum that he has and the popularity he has in the Democratic Party. And we have both Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren for different reasons, whether it's Medicare for All or financial issues, who have been extremely critical of Joe Biden. And so I do think that he - while he will not be onstage, he will loom large onstage tonight. MONTANARO: And by the way, no hand raising tonight. So some of those more liberal policies that we saw earlier - some of the Democrats want to get away from having to commit to those. CORNISH: That's NPR's Asma Khalid and Domenico Montanaro in Detroit for tonight's first round of the Democratic presidential debate. Thanks, you two. KHALID: You're welcome.

            "article_content": "Sen. Bernie Sanders delivered a defense of his \"Medicare for All\" plan Wednesday, as other candidates claim the mantle and former Vice President Joe Biden argues against his approach.  MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders made the case today for eliminating private health insurance and shifting the country to a single-payer Medicare system. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BERNIE SANDERS: The time is now to go forward. The time is now to expand Medicare to every man, woman and child in this country. KELLY: Of course, if that sounds familiar, it might be because Sanders has been making this same case for years that is now the central policy debate in a presidential race where Sanders is struggling to maintain the momentum he built up with progressives for the last four years. NPR's Scott Detrow is covering the presidential campaign. He is here in the studio now. Hey, Scott. SCOTT DETROW, BYLINE: Hey, good afternoon. KELLY: Hi. So as we noted, we have heard Bernie Sanders make the case for \"Medicare for All.\" I think we could all recite it in our sleep at this point. Did he shake it up at all? Did he, you know, spice up this message in his speech today? DETROW: Yeah. There was definitely a focus. You know, as you mentioned, this has become a focal point in the campaign. And one of the main points of contention between Sanders and former Vice President Joe Biden and one of the main criticisms has been something that Sanders readily acknowledges, that this plan would lead to a major tax increase as part of it. So Sanders spent a lot of time arguing today that that would be worth it because it would lower health care costs, and it would eliminate insurance payments. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) SANDERS: Oh, my God, dear. The insurance premium is here. What a wonderful day. Oh, wow. (APPLAUSE) SANDERS: Let's celebrate. Hey, another $2,000 a month for insurance, and small businesses, they just love it, every month paying those insurance premiums. DETROW: So kind of in more of his Larry David mode there making fun of the idea that nobody likes to pay insurance payments. You know, there's no question this would be a massive shift to the American health insurance system. And that is another one of Joe Biden's big criticisms. He said, look; I was part of the fight to pass the Affordable Care Act, Obamacare - incredibly hard to pass. This is so much beyond that. It would be near impossible to pass. And you need to remember that whether it's Sanders or Biden or any other Democrat taking office, best-case scenario for them is a very narrow Senate majority and very likely Republicans would be in charge of the Senate. KELLY: I'm thinking of the biggest obvious difference between now and 2016, which is that Bernie Sanders is running in a very crowded field of Democrats, some of whom also support Medicare for All. How did he contrast his plan with the others that are out there? DETROW: What's been interesting is that he really hasn't made that contrast at all on Medicare for All, on any other front. He's instead just criticized Joe Biden a lot. And, you know, both Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris, who are gaining on him in the polls, have co-sponsored his Medicare for All bill, but both have been a lot more hesitant than Sanders at several points when it comes to the idea of totally eliminating private health insurance. Warren finally did embrace that position fully in the debate last month. Sanders did issue a challenge today to other candidates to refuse campaign contributions from the insurance and drug industry - not just PACs but individual executives in that field as well. KELLY: Step back from health care, Scott. On other issues when you look at this campaign as a whole, how is Sanders trying to distinguish himself in this, again, very crowded field? DETROW: You know, there's no question that he's really lost a lot of momentum in recent weeks. For much of the year, he and Biden were far ahead of any other candidate. But Elizabeth Warren has been steadily gaining ground for months now focusing on a lot of big policy plans that are very similar to what Bernie Sanders is talking about. And, of course, Kamala Harris had that big moment at the debate last month where she took on Joe Biden. Bernie Sanders was standing right between them, but he didn't really have that breakout moment in the debate. So this has been - you've seen his poll numbers be stagnant as Harris and Warren have gained. Sanders' campaign insists that they're not worried. I talked to his campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, about this. FAIZ SHAKIR: They are new candidates in the race, and that is a credit to them. Most people do not know who they are there. They're out there campaigning more. They're advertising themselves. They're raising money. They're fresher to the scene for that reason. And so you're seeing other candidates get a little more support, which is good. It's healthy. It's fine. DETROW: So they insist that this trend will go away. But if it continues, it cuts into a main argument Sanders is making, that he can bring the progressive change but also can be the person best positioned to defeat Donald Trump. KELLY: Scott, we've mentioned Joe Biden a couple of times, which is inevitable if you're covering this field of Democrats. He also rolled out a health care plan this week. What is it? DETROW: Yeah. The short version of that is he keeps Obamacare in place, and he builds on it by doing an optional plan like what Sanders is talking about for people who want to opt in to that government-run health insurance plan. This is the public option that you may remember from the original Obamacare debate. Biden wants to do that. And his a political argument here is that the plan that Sanders, Harris and Warren want to do does away with the current Obamacare system that, of course, has gotten more popular after Biden and Obama left office.

Elizabeth Warren is the only leading Democratic presidential candidate addressing the Netroots Nation conference on Saturday. The progressive activists there are excited by how many candidates are representing their views in the 2020 campaign. Progressive activists feel like this is their moment. Their values are no longer seen as fringe ideas in the Democratic Party. Multiple presidential candidates are talking about \"Medicare-for-all,\" reparations for slavery and bold action on climate change. And their ideas are driving the action on debate stages. Now, as they gather in Philadelphia for the largest progressive convention of the year, Netroots Nation, they feel empowered as if this is their time to take over the party, push traditional Democrats aside and hold candidates accountable. \"We are not going to allow establishment Democrats who are thinking that we're still in 1980 ... to do anything but strongly go forward with a bold plan,\" said Aimee Allison, the president and founder of She the People, a network focused on elevating the political power of women of color. Allison, like other activists at Netroots this weekend, sees the conference as a chance to energize progressive forces and prepare for battle within their own party. \"We are sick and tired of waiting for change,\" said Yvette Simpson, the CEO of Democracy for America, a progressive PAC founded in 2004. \"Change has to happen now.\" Democracy for America has not yet endorsed a presidential candidate but intends to do so before the primaries begin. There's excitement, activists say, around the sheer number of progressive candidates, compared with moderates. But these activists don't agree on who they want to win. They're in agreement that former Vice President Joe Biden is too moderate. Many point to the momentum that Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren is gaining in both polling and fundraising. They say they're energized by her grassroots campaign and her emphasis on policy plans. Other activists point to California Sen. Kamala Harris, with her strong debate performance and the very identity she represents as a black woman, as an exciting opportunity for change. And others are still loyal to Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. They say he has been an ideological trailblazer who has fundamentally shifted the Democratic Party's agenda since his 2016 run. \"There was a time when you didn't have many options,\" said Simpson. \"This is a great time for the progressive movement.\" Activists say they feel that they'll have a chance to vote out of optimism, rather than fear or electability, this cycle. But among the five candidates polling the highest at this moment, Warren is the only one attending the presidential forum at Netroots this Saturday, raising questions about the power of progressives at the very moment they think they have the ability to control the party's direction. Some activists question why any candidate would bypass the forum, since it's a chance to tap into the most vocal and energized subset of the progressive movement. They say this gives Warren an unfettered chance to further consolidate her support in front of what's expected to be a friendly crowd for her message. The Massachusetts senator has been a frequent speaker at previous Netroots conventions. Markos Moulitsas, the founder of the progressive website Daily Kos, has been openly critical of Sanders and said this is a strange opportunity for the candidate to skip, given the pressure he's facing as Harris and Warren have risen in the field. Sanders made ideas like \"Medicare-for-all\" mainstream in the party, but this cycle, many other candidates are calling for similar changes. Moulitsas said that's a key challenge for Sanders in a progressive movement that is eager to see women and people of color in leadership. \"Bernie \u2014 he's polarizing. ... He is unable to speak in a way that draws in the more diverse elements of the Democratic Party ... and so given that there are other options, I think it's tough for him,\" said Moulitsas. And that priority is becoming more apparent on the left. Progressives have long called for ideas such as accessible health care and affordable college, which remain top goals for them. But increasingly, racial and social justice is also a part of the equation. \"It's not just enough to talk about economics without looking at the economics for a woman of color,\" said Natalia Salgado, a political strategist with the Center for Popular Democracy Action. That's an evolution within the movement in the past few years as a number of minorities have taken leadership positions in progressive organizations. And it has also led to a shift in what progressives are looking for in a candidate this cycle. \"The progressive movement is looking for candidates who are embracing racial, economic and gender justice,\" said Allison. \"And any candidate who seems hesitant or unable to ... looks like they're on a downward trajectory,\" said Allison.",

            "article_content": "Presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders says he doesn't think age should be a determining factor in the 2020 race. Sanders spoke with NPR about some of his signature platform issues.  AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: If Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders is elected president next year, he'll be the oldest person to take office for the first time. The same could be said for former Vice President Joe Biden. And the current record was just set by President Donald Trump. Several younger Democratic presidential candidates have seized on the idea of generational change. Sanders shared his take on that and much more with the NPR Politics Podcast and New Hampshire Public Radio. NPR's Scott Detrow has more. SCOTT DETROW, BYLINE: Sanders always has a lot on his mind, especially when he has to sit there while producers adjust microphones. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) BERNIE SANDERS: Oh, NPR is going to drive me completely crazy. DETROW: But during last week's debate, he wasn't called on during a key moment when Congressman Eric Swalwell urged Biden to pass the torch to the younger candidates. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ERIC SWALWELL: We ought to contribute to the generational... SANDERS: Part of Joe's generation... UNIDENTIFIED MODERATOR: Before we move on... SWALWELL: I'm all for generational change. UNIDENTIFIED MODERATOR: Before we move on... SANDERS: Part of Joe's generation - let me respond. DETROW: Nobody called on Sanders, so I asked him what he was trying to say. He says age shouldn't be the determining factor. In fact, he calls that argument pretty superficial. (SOUNDBITE OF NPR ARCHIVED BROADCAST) SANDERS: Because I think what the American people want to know from you - whether you're old or you're young, whether you're black or you're white, whether you're a woman, whether you're a man - they want to know what you stand for, and what are you going to do to improve their lives? So if I'm a vital, young person and I want to throw 32 million people off of health insurance - we have some of these vital, young Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives - wow, great new generation. It is what you stand for. DETROW: On the debate stage, several other candidates challenged his signature policy plan, a \"Medicare for All,\" single-payer health care system. They said it would raise taxes and kick people off private insurance. Sanders doesn't disagree. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) SANDERS: Are people going to pay more in taxes? And the answer is of course some people will pay more in taxes. Are people going to lose the private insurance that they have - yeah. Every year now, the estimate is that about 40 million people lose their private insurance. You get a new job. You quit your job. DETROW: Sanders says the upside is worth the political risk. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) SANDERS: But very rarely am I asked what it will mean to the American people when you can go to the doctor anytime you want and there is no copayment; there is no deductible. You don't have to take out your wallet. DETROW: Still, polls show support for a single-payer system drops by a lot when respondents learn it would come with higher taxes and could force them off private insurance. Those are aspects Republicans plan to highlight against Sanders or any other eventual Democratic nominee. I asked Sanders about the candidate ahead of him in early polls, Joe Biden. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) DETROW: You have said in a lot of interviews lately that Democrats need to excite voters. SANDERS: Yes. DETROW: They need to give them a reason to go to the polls. SANDERS: Yes, I have. DETROW: Does Joe Biden do that? SANDERS: I'll let Joe Biden - I'll let you ask Joe Biden that question. DETROW: But just a few moments later, Sanders warned that Democrats may not win if they don't get high turnout from young voters, voters of color and people who sometimes don't show up on Election Day. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) SANDERS: But you're not going to have that turnout unless the candidate has issues that excite people, that energize people. That means you have to be talking about \"Medicare for All.\" You have to be talking about raising the minimum wage to a living wage of $15 an hour. You have to be talking about making public colleges and universities tuition-free and canceling student debt. You've got to be talking about climate change and a bold response to the planetary crisis. DETROW: Biden supports the $15 minimum wage but hasn't gone as far as Sanders and several other candidates on the other policy areas. Sanders' campaign has made his electability a key theme this year as poll after poll shows voters looking for a candidate who can beat Trump. As much as he likes to dismiss polling, Sanders regularly points to surveys showing him defeating Trump in a hypothetical matchup. But he also allows for this. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) SANDERS: But if perchance it is not me, I will do everything I can to support the winner and make sure we defeat Donald Trump.

            "article_content": "Democratic presidential candidates will gather in California this weekend for a state Democratic Party convention. California's liberal policies have served as an inspiration for many.  AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: Fourteen Democratic presidential candidates will campaign in the same state this weekend - not Iowa or New Hampshire, but California. The state moved its primary to early March, and starting tomorrow, California Democrats will gather at their party's convention in San Francisco. California has long set the policy agenda for other blue states, and as Capital Public Radio's Ben Adler reports, it's helping to shape the presidential race, too. BEN ADLER, BYLINE: Sanctuary state, cap and trade, health care for children living in the state illegally - that's just a partial list of what California has done over the past few years. And here's some of what the state's new governor, Gavin Newsom, called for in his State of the State address. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) GAVIN NEWSOM: While we pursue the long-term goal of single-payer financing, let us make a down payment now by expanding MediCal coverage for Californians up to the age of 26, regardless of their immigration status. Get me a good package on rent stability this year, and I will sign it. (APPLAUSE) NEWSOM: Major initiatives like paid sick leave, universal preschool, free community college. ADLER: If some of those ideas sound familiar, perhaps it's because you've heard Democrats talk about them in Congress and on the presidential campaign trail. Take, for example, California's own senator, Kamala Harris, at her January kickoff rally in Oakland. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KAMALA HARRIS: ...That health care is a fundamental right, and we will deliver that right with \"Medicare for All.\" (APPLAUSE) ADLER: California Democrats make no apologies for pushing the envelope. In an interview with Capital Public Radio earlier this spring, Governor Newsom said he's proud his state is holding its own. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST) NEWSOM: We're substituting, I think, for leadership at a time when we have a president who's abdicated leadership. He's going in a completely different direction than this state. ADLER: Some proposals that started in California have spread to the rest of the country, especially environmental policies; others, like the push for universal health care and the state's employment laws, have not. ALLAN ZAREMBERG: People throughout the country don't always say California's a trendsetter; they say those people in California are a little crazy with some of their ideas. ADLER: California Chamber of Commerce President Allan Zaremberg calls his state the test tube for the rest of the nation. He says California's policies are costing residents more in the short term, and it's not yet clear which ones, if any, will pay for themselves down the road. ZAREMBERG: I wouldn't say California's adopted the Green New Deal, but I would say California's adopted elements of it. And certainly, in some cases, the benefits are worth the cost, but we have to make sure that, in all cases, the benefits equal the cost. ADLER: Republicans argue California's blue-state agenda will help them paint Democrats as extreme. Here's California GOP chairwoman Jessica Patterson. JESSICA PATTERSON: You're going to see candidates that are pushed further and further to an agenda that is not consistent with even California, I believe, but the overall country. ADLER: But Dana Williamson, a top aide to former Democratic governor Jerry Brown disagrees. DANA WILLIAMSON: I don't think that California's necessarily pushing any of the candidates to the left; I think the issues that we've been talking about for a long time are issues that are now resonating in other parts of the country, and so they're talking about it more. ADLER: Williamson thinks most voters will search for their own balance between policy views and electability. WILLIAMSON: Because you can support somebody who's got no support, and you're going to end up with Donald Trump in office, and I don't think anybody wants that. ADLER: Most of the Democratic field will speak at this weekend's California Democratic Party convention, but there is a conspicuous absence - former Vice President Joe Biden, who's been skipping state party events like this one, plans to campaign in Ohio.

John Hickenlooper says Democrats need to focus on \"kitchen table issues\" like jobs in order to beat President Trump in 2020. Former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper warned his party of straying too far to the left as it selects a nominee to face President Trump in next year's election. Hickenlooper, one of the 23 candidates running for the Democratic Party's nomination, told NPR why he doesn't believe in some of the party's major policy proposals, such as the Green New Deal and \"Medicare for All.\" \"If we don't stand up and say that we Democrats don't stand for socialism, we're going to end up reelecting the worst president this country's ever had,\" Hickenlooper said. Hickenlooper spoke with Morning Edition as part of the show's Opening Arguments conversations, exploring the presidential candidates' core messages. On the leftward shift in the Democratic Party I don't think we're going to address climate change by guaranteeing every American a federal job, which is what part of the Green New Deal was. I don't think we're going to address the spiraling inflation in health care by forcibly telling 150 million people that we're going to take away their private insurance. These are what a lot of Americans look at as facets or aspects of socialism. On focusing on economic issues instead of social policies Certainly we want to address income inequality. Right. Absolutely we want to make sure that women have a right to choose, that civil rights and social justice are addressed aggressively. But we've also got to recognize to win in Ohio and Michigan and North Carolina and Wisconsin, we're going to have to get more to those kitchen table issues that have to do with somebody's job, or how many jobs they're having to work just to balance a household budget. On the identity fight within the Democratic Party One of the things I've always loved about the Democratic Party is that it is a big-tent party, and it embraces opportunity for all people. I'm running for president because I think my life experience can address this. This Trump-fueled national crisis of division has been moving us backward. I look at my experience of bringing people together \u2014 businesses and nonprofits, and Republicans and Democrats \u2014 and to really get things done; to get to near-universal health care, to have the No. 1 economy in the country for three consecutive years, I think that record stands for itself. ... I think in some [ways] I'm the only person running who has actually accomplished what everyone else is talking about. Victoria Whitley-Berry contributed to this story and produced for air.",

MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: Well, while Democrats here in Washington talk impeachment, Democrats on the campaign trail, the presidential campaign trail, have been talking to us. We're getting to know some of the candidates over the next few months with the help of the NPR Politics Podcast team and with the help of New Hampshire Public Radio and Iowa Public Radio. NPR's Tamara Keith hosts the Politics Podcast. She joins me now. Hi there, Tam. TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Hello. KELLY: So you were just in Iowa. You were with Iowa Public Radio's lead political reporter, Clay Masters. You two sat down with Democratic candidate Pete Buttigieg. Where'd y'all sit down? Where were you? KEITH: Well, we caught up with him at a union hall in Des Moines where he was attending a book club. And this is not an ordinary book club because it's Iowa. They are reading books written by the Democratic presidential candidates, and then the candidates are actually coming to these book club meetings. KELLY: I love it. KEITH: There was no wine, but the room was packed, and people stuck around long after the conversation was over to get their book signed and to take pictures. And then Buttigieg came across the hall to talk to us. He's the mayor of South Bend, Ind. He went to Harvard, was a Rhodes Scholar, speaks several languages, is an Afghanistan veteran. He's 37 years old and proudly millennial. And he's also openly gay. And we asked him what was obscured by his resume. He pointed to his upbringing in South Bend, Ind. PETE BUTTIGIEG: I didn't even know that it was unusual to have empty factories and empty houses all around you. Then I moved out and realized that that was kind of a defining feature of my part of the country. KELLY: Were you able, as you interviewed him, Tam, to get policy specifics out of him? Because one of the criticisms so far of his campaign is we are learning a lot about his life story, less about what he might actually do if elected president. KEITH: Right before we interviewed him, he had just posted an issues section on his website, and his policy positions are more moderate than many in the Democratic field. We talked through a number of policy items with him, like health care where he says he favors Medicare for all who want it as opposed to the Bernie Sanders plan, for instance, which is \"Medicare for All.\" As he talks about his positions on a number of things, he articulates a problem, he outlines the broad brush strokes of a solution, but unlike several of the other Democrats who are running, he doesn't really get into the nitty-gritty details of how his ideas would work or be paid for. One thing we talked to him about was trade and how he would get out of this China trade war that's happening right now with the Trump administration. And he said that it isn't as much about the trade deficit as it is something much bigger than that. It's about global influence. BUTTIGIEG: They entered into this trade conflict without a plan, and it is making farmers worse off. If this next round of tariffs kicks in, it's going to make consumers worse off. And it ignores the bigger issue in the China challenge, which is not about the export-import balance. It's about whether the rest of this century happens on terms that are favorable to the American model or the Chinese model. And, obviously, I've got a pretty strong sense of which model is best, but you see the Chinese model being held up as a credible alternative to ours because ours looks chaotic and unstable and theirs has generated such growth. KEITH: So this is another case of him clearly identifying what he sees as the problem, criticizing the way the president is handling it but not quite clearly mapping out exactly how he would solve it if he were president. KELLY: OK. I have to ask - did you get to meet the other Mr. Buttigieg, his husband who's already been a force in the Pete Buttigieg campaign? KEITH: No, he was not in Iowa on this trip, but I did ask Pete Buttigieg about President Trump's recent comments about seeing him and his husband, Chasten, campaigning together. He said I have no problem with it whatsoever. I think it's good. What did you think of that? BUTTIGIEG: That's nice. I'm more interested in policies that affect LGBTQ people. The Equality Act has moved through the House. I doubt that this president will champion the Equality Act. You know, what somebody says in an interview is one thing; how they govern is another - and whether it's that issue or any other issues. You know, so much attention is given to whatever remarkably outrageous and vicious and insulting thing that the president said. Or I suppose in this case, expectations are so low that he made news by saying something that wasn't viciously insulting. And that's not what matters. KEITH: So that was sort of a vintage Buttigieg response to the president - to be both critical of him and dismissive of Trump and the fact that Trump is even being discussed while at the same time discussing Trump. KELLY: (Laughter) OK. That's NPR's Tamara Keith talking about her interview there with Pete Buttigieg. Tam, thanks and looking forward to more of them. KEITH: You're welcome.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., says the path to GOP success in 2020 is running \"to be the firewall that saves the country from socialism.\" McConnell told reporters Thursday that he is advising all Republican Senate candidates to run on offense by casting themselves as the only alternative to Democrats who want to drive the country to the left. \"You add up things like packing the Supreme Court, getting rid of the electoral college, the Green New Deal, and Medicare for none and you have a prescription of turning America into something it never has been and never should be,\" McConnell said. \"So we intend to be on the offense in running our races.\" McConnell said Republicans running for Senate can also \"paint your own picture of what your service has meant to your constituents\" \u2014 a plan that involves highlighting the Senate's work on criminal justice reform and combating the opioid crisis. Left-leaning policies discussed by Democrats on the presidential campaign trail will help form the foundation of GOP attacks on Democrats running for other offices as well. \"My experience in politics has been that very few voters come out and vote and say thank you,\" McConnell said. \"They generally are looking for what the deficiencies are on one side or another and I think what we're seeing in the Democratic presidential primaries, gives us a sense of what we should be against in 2020.\" The top Senate GOP leader said his party can learn a lesson from the 2018 election when it lost control of the House of Representatives. He said a 2020 campaign needs to repair major losses among women and college graduates to regain ground with critical suburban voters. \"We did very poorly in the suburbs, which cost us the House,\" he said. \"To give you a sense of that the gender issue, we lost women by four points in 2014 \u2014 about typical you know in a successful year for us. We lost women by 19 in '18 and we lost college graduates for the first time in my memory. That is not a path to political success.\" That plan of attack isn't preventing McConnell from pursuing some bipartisan agreements in the many months ahead next year's elections. McConnell says he has a good working relationship with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and he has high hopes that the two can work together to reach a two-year budget agreement in the near future. He announced plans earlier this week to work with Pelosi and the White House on a bipartisan deal to prevent a government shutdown later this year. \"We're each enabling at the staff level people to begin to discuss what we're going to do,\" McConnell said. \"And we have to do it together.\" Pelosi and McConnell hope to avoid a repeat of the 35-day partial government shutdown that started before Christmas last year and dragged on until January 25 of this year. One way to avoid that is for party leaders to reach a deal on a spending package that satisfies a majority of members in the middle, even if it alienates progressives and conservatives on the fringes of each party. \"The only thing possible is a bipartisan agreement that probably in the end the most liberal members of her party don't vote for and most conservative members of my party don't vote for,\" McConnell said. \"But it gives us some semblance of a way to have a normal appropriations process.\" The words of encouragement about a deal weren't without a dig at Pelosi's political predicament in managing her new, ideologically diverse majority. McConnell compared liberal House Democrats \u2014 many of whom tried to force votes on liberal issues like Medicare for All and the Green New Deal and threatened to vote against a budget bill to push for greater domestic spending \u2014  to the divisive House Freedom Caucus that fractured the GOP in previous years. \"I was almost tempted to call up my good friend the speaker and say 'congratulations you've got a Freedom Caucus on your hands,' \" McConnell joked. \"And she clearly does.\"",

As Democratic candidates for president try to walk a political tightrope between the party's progressive wing and its center-left, they are facing increasing pressure to outline the details of their health care overhaul proposals. On Wednesday, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who is running in Democratic primaries, reaffirmed his stance on health care by reintroducing a \"Medicare-for-all\" bill, the idea that fueled his 2016 presidential run. As with its previous iterations, Sanders' latest bill would establish a national, single-payer Medicare system with vastly expanded benefits. Sanders' plan would also prohibit private plans from competing with Medicare and would eliminate cost-sharing. New in this version is a universal provision for long-term care in home and community settings (though Medicaid would continue to cover institutional care, and states would determine the standard of eligibility). Already, it has an impressive list of Senate co-sponsors \u2014 including some of Sanders' rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination: Cory Booker of New Jersey, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Kamala Harris of California and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. But many of the candidates \u2014 even official \"Medicare-for-all\" co-sponsors \u2014 are at the same time edging toward a more incremental approach, called \"Medicare for America.\" Proponents argue it could deliver better health care to all Americans while avoiding political, budgetary and legal objections. This movement to embrace a more incremental policy comes as politicians tread carefully over the political land mines a \"Medicare-for-all\" endorsement could unleash, while seeking to capitalize on voters' growing appetite for health overhaul. During the 2018 midterm election campaigns, some congressional candidates talked about allowing younger people \u2014 anyone older than 55 \u2014 to join Medicare or allowing people younger than 65 to buy into it if they choose (what's come to be called the public option). Many candidates aren't eager to face the industry opposition a full-on Medicare expansion would surely trigger. From the consumer perspective, a sweeping overhaul poses a risk. Despite Medicare's popularity with its beneficiaries, the majority of Americans express satisfaction with their health care, and many are nervous about giving up private options. Also, many analysts are worried that a generous \"Medicare-for-all\" plan that promises everything would break the bank if it didn't include copayments from patients. That tension is pushing a number of candidates toward an option that has come to be called Medicare for America. The bill was introduced last December with little fanfare by two Democrats \u2014 Rep. Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut and Rep. Jan Schakowsky of Illinois. It hasn't been reintroduced in the new Congress. This proposed system would guarantee universal coverage, but leave job-based insurance available for those who want it. Unlike \"Medicare-for-all,\" though, it would preserve premiums and deductibles, so beneficiaries would still have to pay some costs out-of-pocket. The bill would allow private insurers to operate Medicare plans as well \u2014 a system called Medicare Advantage, which covers about a third of the program's beneficiaries currently and which would be outlawed under \"Medicare-for-all.\" \"Before policies get defined, what you see is people endorsing a plan that is a little, perhaps, less subject to early attack,\" says Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster with Lake Research Partners. \"A lot of candidates feel if they endorse a plan that leaves some private insurance, they get more time to say what their ideas are about.\" \"Medicare for America\" got its first high-profile endorsement from former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke, who launched his own 2020 bid for president in mid-March. Other candidates \u2014 including Warren, Gillibrand and Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind. \u2014 have tiptoed toward that policy without making any endorsements, suggesting they back \"Medicare-for-all\" in theory but also support a system that retains private insurance, at least temporarily. Such an approach is perhaps unsurprising. Recent polling indicates voters want strong health care improvement. And candidates need something powerful to deliver, election analysts say. Simply improving the Affordable Care Act \u2014 an idea backed by Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat running in the primary's moderate lane \u2014 may not suffice. \"The ACA is popular at the 50 percent level, but it's not energetic,\" says Robert Blendon, a political analyst at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. \"It doesn't get people who really like it. What they're looking for is something that is exciting but isn't threatening.\" Both \"Medicare-for-all\" and \"Medicare for America,\" pollsters note, offer something that presidential candidates can campaign on \u2014 a health care alternative that, at first blush, sounds appealing to many. But the latter proposal might more easily skirt some potential obstacles. In polls, approval for the concept of \"Medicare-for-all\" drops when people learn that under such a program, they would very likely lose their current health plan (even if the government-offered plan could theoretically provide more generous coverage). And, meanwhile, the cost-sharing element of \"Medicare for America\" would ostensibly quiet some concerns that have been raised about paying for Medicare's expansion. (Still, critics on the left worry it would mean some people would remain unable to afford care.) This also tracks with recent polling suggesting that while \"Medicare-for-all\" support can be swayed, voters of all political stripes favor some way to extend optional Medicare coverage, without necessarily eliminating the private industry altogether. Employers would either have to offer plans that were at least as generous as the government program or send their employees to Medicare. And employers who stop offering health benefits would have to pay a Medicare payroll tax. For now, most candidates are still avoiding a concrete stance on the \"Medicare for America\" plan. Despite signs of interest, the Buttigieg, Gillibrand and Warren campaigns have all declined to directly answer questions about whether they endorse \"Medicare for America.\" The campaigns of other candidates in the race \u2014 Harris, Klobuchar, Booker, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro and Washington Gov. Jay Inslee \u2014 similarly declined to comment. Reading between the lines, though, their promises to achieve universal health care by expanding Medicare \u2014 while retaining private insurance \u2014 leave them few options aside from something like \"Medicare for America,\" argues Jacob Hacker, a political scientist at Yale University and one the proposal's main architects. \"There are variations besides this particular plan, but once you start to actually dig into this, if you want universal coverage you're going to have to do the kinds of things\" spelled out in \"Medicare for America,\" Hacker says. Still, though, the plan Hacker helped design has prompted objections from both the left and the right. On the far left, the cost-sharing component is a dominant concern. (Under \"Medicare for America,\" an individual would have a $3,500 out-of-pocket annual limit; a family would have a $5,000 limit. Premiums would be capped at almost 10 percent of a household's income.) Critics on the left also say the plan's accommodations to private insurance limit the government's ability to negotiate lower prices. Meanwhile, conservatives repeat many of the arguments levied against \"Medicare-for-all\" \u2014 that the plan is too expensive, too disruptive. Political analysts predict that contributors to the health care industry who have already mobilized against \"Medicare-for-all\" \u2014 including hospitals, insurers, drugmakers and many doctors \u2014 also can be expected to make a strong showing against \"Medicare for America.\" More Medicare means less revenue for the medical industry. \"The fact of expanded Medicare will be the focus of attacks,\" says the Commonweath Fund's David Blumenthal.

Abigail Spanberger attends a town hall at Nottoway High School in Crewe, Va. She was one of dozens of new members who ousted Republicans on a pledge to buck party leaders and work across the aisle. For Democrats, one of the keys to winning control of the House of Representatives last year was convincing voters in formerly Republican districts that there's more than one way to be a Democrat. Rep. Abigail Spanberger, D-Va., was one of dozens of new members who ousted Republicans, in part on a pledge to buck party leaders and work across the aisle. Spanberger spent her first three months in office following through on that promise \u2014 she voted against Nancy Pelosi for speaker of the House and split from Democrats on a number of procedural votes. But constituents in her ideologically diverse district are still asking if her independence will stand firm as other more nationally recognized Democrats, like her House colleague New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and several Senate Democrats running for president in 2020 try to pull the party to the left ahead of the election in 2020. Spanberger's bipartisan credentials were a central issue for voters at a town hall in the Nottoway High School auditorium in rural Crewe, Va, a more conservative corner of her district. \"I've heard you talk a lot tonight about bipartisanship,\" said a woman who identified herself as Sue Christian, a resident of Crewe. Christian had questions on Spanberger's stance on abortion rights and scandals surrounding Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam who faced pressure to resign after a racist yearbook photo surfaced decades after he was in medical school. But she also wanted to know about Spanberger's voting record. \"Have you ever voted against Nancy Pelosi?,\" she asked. \"And if so, on what?\" That's a question Spanberger was ready for. The former CIA officer and first-time politician knew that once she defeated Republican Dave Brat to represent Virginia's 7th Congressional District she'd have to defend her promise to work across the aisle pretty often. \"Yes,\" she responded with a smile. \"So I voted against Nancy Pelosi a couple of times. I did not vote for her to be speaker of the House.\" Rep. Spanberger's constituents file into the Nottoway High School auditorium.

She went on to say she also voted with Republicans on a number of smaller bills \u2014 including an amendment to a gun bill that drew the ire and frustration of many of her progressive colleagues. Spanberger also highlighted her work on the bipartisan \"Problem Solvers\" caucus and told voters that she was one of just a handful of Democrats invited to the White House in January to discuss border security with President Trump. But that record has not been enough to completely inoculate her from questions about her role in a party that some voters see as moving steadily to the left. Over the course of the hour-long meeting, Spanberger fielded questions on Obamacare, President Trump's push for a Southern border wall and some social issues. Peter Hasso spoke up to challenge Spanberger on her position on Trump's proposed border wall with Mexico. After the meeting he said Spanberger's answers were pretty much what he expected, and he wasn't convinced that she's any different from other Democrats. Peter Hasso says Rep. Spanberger can't support Reps. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and still say she's a different kind of Democrat.\n                \n                    \n                    Matt Eich for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Peter Hasso says Rep.

It doesn't matter whether you're Democrat or Republican, they get mired in the system.\" He says Democrats like Spanberger are getting drawn into a party that wants to go left \u2014 and specifically mentioned progressive members like Reps. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., and Ocasio-Cortez, who he identified as socialists. Hasso says Spanberger can't support Omar and Ocasio-Cortez and still say she's a different kind of Democrat. \"She's riding both sides of the fence,\" Hasso said. \"And she's trying not to be identified. I don't blame her. I wouldn't want to be identified with AOC and all of these other people.\" Spanberger says her record should speak for itself but her liberal colleagues are often the ones in the national spotlight passionately defending controversial policies like Medicare-for-all and the sweeping climate proposal known as the Green New Deal. Their priorities, and not hers, have been setting the tone for what a lot of voters picture when they hear the label Democrat. Rep. Spanberger speaks with a constituent at the town hall.

That led to threats from progressives that they would get activists to target moderates to try to sway their votes. \"I can have colleagues threaten me as much as they like,\" Spanberger said. \"I'm going to continue serving my district in a way I think is important. And I'm going to continue serving in Congress in a way I think is important. And that doesn't mean falling in line on every single vote.\" Hasso and some other voters here aren't moved by that argument at all.

But others, like Billy Coleburn, the mayor of the nearby town of Blackstone, say they've really been impressed by Spanberger's willingness to stand up to Pelosi and to come out and talk to voters at town halls like this. And Coleburn wants to be clear he's not exactly a Democrat. \"I am one who voted for Donald Trump,\" Coleburn said. \"I was an obnoxious Trump supporter in 2015 from the minute he got off the elevator, not because he was so good looking or eloquent, but because I wanted to put the middle finger to the establishment.\" But now, he could see himself voting a split ticket, Trump/Spanberger in 2020, provided Spanberger keeps voting independently. \"As someone who still believes in Trump's policies, I have a lot of respect for Abigail Spanberger,\" Coleburn said. \"We've talked, we've joked about that.\"",

Amy Klobuchar. She was re-elected in the purple state in 2018 by 24 points, and in January Morning Consult polling found her to be one of the most popular senators in the country. She's hoping that strong support in her home state \u2014 which happens to be in the upper Midwest, neighboring states where Donald Trump carved his path to victory \u2014 can translate into support from primary voters looking for someone who can beat President Trump as they choose the 2020 Democratic presidential nominee. But on the way, Klobuchar faces some obstacles: her moderate politics (at least, relative to many of her competitors for the nomination) may turn off some Democratic primary voters, as may some of the reports that she has mistreated her staff. Klobuchar discussed her approach to policy, politics and leadership with NPR's Rachel Martin. She's the fifth 2020 candidate to talk to Morning Edition for an Opening Argument conversation, exploring the presidential candidates' core messages. Martin: Several Democratic presidential candidates support some version of \"Medicare for All\" or single-payer health care system. Do you? Klobuchar: Every American deserves affordable health care, and we have to move to universal health care. So, what I support is moving to universal health care as quickly as possible. Martin: And when you say universal health care, you mean a single-payer system. Klobuchar: I mean health care for everyone ... and we may end up there one day. But what's the fastest way we can expand health care more immediately? I would do cost-sharing and reinsurance. That's a bill that's out there right now to help with premiums. ... Then, the public option, in the first year we should pass legislation for a public option that could be done with Medicaid or with Medicare. You could expand Medicare. You could expand Medicaid, but have a public option, which is the original idea that President Obama conceived. Why? Because then you would have a less expensive option for people to go to. That could result in a lot of people leaving other private plans to go to that public option, and Medicaid's an interesting way to do it. Many Democrats in this presidential field are backing some form of single-payer health care, following the lead of Bernie Sanders' 2016 campaign, in which he pushed his Medicare for All plan. That sets Klobuchar apart from some of her competitors. Her route to \"universal health care\" doesn't mean putting everyone on a government-administered insurance plan. Rather, she first supports a bipartisan plan backed in the last Congress by Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., and Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn. That bill, which ultimately failed, would have stabilized the Obamacare exchanges. In addition, Klobuchar has said that she wants to allow people to buy into Medicaid via a bill sponsored by Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii \u2014 a \"public option\" plan. That said, Klobuchar explains that she's not exactly against Medicare for All. She told NPR, \"We may end up there one day. But what's the fastest way we can expand health care more immediately?\" Martin: More than any candidate, in a very large field of Democratic presidential hopefuls, you have a proven record of working across the aisle with Republicans. You are by most definitions someone who legislates from the center \u2014 a political moderate. Do you think that helps you or hurts you in this campaign? Klobuchar: I would hope that it helps me, because when you look at my record I have stood up on so many progressive issues, whether it is choice, whether it is the environment, whether it is standing up for immigrants and against racial injustice. But there are moments where we can find common ground. ... I worked with [Former Utah GOP] Sen. [Orrin] Hatch to get a billion dollars for school safety after the tragedy in Parkland. But that doesn't mean that I don't stand my ground. So while I was the lead Democrat on the school safety money, which passed overwhelmingly, I also was standing my ground against the president when it comes to universal background checks and an assault weapon ban. I sat directly across from him at that meeting, listened to him say nine times he wanted to get universal background checks done, and then saw him bow to the NRA the next day. That's just wrong. So, I use that example because on one hand you can find common ground with people like Sen. Hatch on the billion dollars for school safety, and then you can fight the bigger battles. Progressive voters are clearly energized in this campaign, as evidenced by the kinds of positions many of the candidates are taking. Klobuchar still takes some relatively liberal stands \u2014 she's a co-sponsor on the Green New Deal, and a public option isn't exactly a popular proposal among Republicans. But she has also stopped short of endorsing Medicare for All and said she opposes tuition-free college. Her willingness to reach out to Republicans might help her with those voters who believe Washington is broken, and that compromise would break gridlock. But it's easy to see how in a primary, running as a candidate who reaches across the aisle might not endear her to those Democratic voters who simply do not want compromise on their most important issues. And while Democrats say they want someone ultimately who is \"electable,\" there are disagreements over whether that means someone who can appeal to the political center or has a clear, progressive message to excite the party's base. Amy Klobuchar\n                \n                    \n                    Amr Alfiky/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Amy Klobuchar Martin: Sen. Elizabeth Warren \u2014 also running for president \u2014 has identified privacy and transparency as an issue when it comes to these tech companies... She wants to break up those companies, so that they can't sell the same products on their platform where competitors are also trying to get an edge in. Do you agree with that plan? Do you think it goes too far? Klobuchar: Well, what's interesting is I see it an even larger way, which is why I've been trying to use antitrust law and make changes there. ... Yeah, some of them you may spin off parts of the companies, some of them you may break off. And you can do things like that, but I think you should do it by getting those things investigated and figure out which company is doing what, number one. Number 2: I would then change the standards under the law so that no longer does the government have to prove that it reduces competition to throw something out; that in fact the companies have to prove that they don't materially reduce competition, which is also a language change to the standard, and also that you can look back at deals like what Facebook just did by buying Instagram and other apps, that you can look to see, even though they already did it, is that anti-competitive? Tech regulation and, more broadly, antitrust regulation may be topics on which Klobuchar can set herself apart from a wide field of candidates. She is well-respected for her knowledge on the topic, and it's an area where she has been active in the Senate. Along with Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., and the late Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., she introduced the Honest Ads Act in 2017. That bill would require better disclosure of the people and organizations who fund online political advertisements. She has also introduced antitrust legislation that could make mergers tougher for large companies. While that might be a dry policy topic to many voters, it could be more of a hot topic this year, as tech firms' uses of customers' private data, as well as the spread of hate speech and propaganda online, have angered many Americans. Martin: There are reports citing several former staffers from your office who allege that you mistreated them. And I ask about this because we are in a moment in this country where we are having a national conversation about power and workplace dynamics and what is acceptable and what is not, especially in a leader. Do you think your behavior in these instances should raise concerns in the minds of voters? Klobuchar: No, I don't. And I would first point to that over 60 of our staff \u2014 former staff came together, everyone from chiefs of staff to people on the front line that worked with me, that were in the car with me all day, and said that they had a good experience working in our office. So, to me that was really important when I saw that letter, and I think it's worth looking at. So that's the first thing. Secondly, I do have high standards. I do push people hard. I have high standards of myself, of our staff and also for our nation. And so that is the way I'm going to look at this going forward. And that is \u2014 I can always do better and I will. But we have gotten so much done with our team. My state director has been with me seven years. My chief of staff around five years. My campaign manager 14 years. You don't win elections like we have, which is winning every single congressional district in Minnesota, including [former GOP Rep.] Michele Bachmann's. You do not pass \u2014 get Vanderbilt to rate you as the No. 1 Democratic senator for getting things done under 15 metrics in the U.S. Senate and the first minority party senator to break the top five since John McCain in 1994. You don't get that done alone. You get that done because you have great staff that work with you, and they're not only just working for me, they are working for our country, and I'm very proud of them. In multiple news stories, former Klobuchar staffers have alleged that the senator engaged in abusive behaviors from bullying to throwing a binder that accidentally hit a staffer. That is raising questions for voters, and Klobuchar has been attempting to answer those stories by acknowledging her high standards for her staff. She has also taken the chance to pitch herself as a candidate with a strength of character that would serve the country well. \"When you're out there on the world stage and dealing with people like Vladimir Putin, yeah, you want someone who's tough,\" she told CNN. \"You want someone that demands the answers and that's going to get things done, and that's what I've done my whole life.\" Bo Hamby and Eric McDaniel produced and edited this interview for broadcast.",

Bernie Sanders speaks during a campaign rally in June 2016 at Qualcomm Stadium in San Diego, Calif. He launched a second presidential campaign on Tuesday, with a big burst of donations from supporters, but new challenges ahead. Bernie Sanders has again proved he should not be underestimated in a presidential contest. Despite talk of his coalition potentially fracturing with such a big Democratic primary field, the Sanders faithful showed they've still got his back. In the 24 hours following the Vermont independent's announcement Tuesday that he was again running for president, he raised a whopping $6 million. He took in $600,000 from people who signed up to make recurring monthly payments to his campaign. That will give him a guaranteed source of revenue that could help him last for a very long time in a protracted primary fight. It's a model that Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who like Sanders identifies as a democratic socialist, also touted. \"It's like Netflix,\" she tweeted, \"but for unbought members of Congress.\" Others see Sanders and his 2020 run as less Netflix and more something else. \"Bernie Sanders is the MySpace or the Friendster of the Democratic left,\" said Jamal Simmons, a Democratic strategist, who worked as an adviser to the Democratic National Committee during Barack Obama's presidential run in 2008. Sanders, Simmons noted, is like the startup that had the great idea, but doesn't become the one to fully capitalize on it. Whichever you agree with, Sanders is undoubtedly going to have a major impact on the 2020 race, a far more crowded affair than 2016. He has several advantages in this campaign for the Democratic nomination: But Sanders also has several disadvantages: People close to Sanders acknowledge his challenges and the differences with 2016. On the socialism label, for example, Larry Cohen, chairman of Our Revolution, an outside group which grew out of Sanders' 2016 campaign, stressed that Sanders is about \"innovation and supporting entrepreneurs.\" Cohen noted, for example, Sanders' support for the Vermont ice cream brand Ben and Jerry's, whose founder Ben Cohen (no relation to Larry) was named one of Sanders' campaign co-chairmen. \"Organizing other businesses with social consciousness, that's been a big part of his life,\" Larry Cohen said. Sanders has also changed the business of how the Democratic Party goes about choosing its candidates. The role of superdelegates, for example, has been scaled back because of Sanders and his objection that they skewed too heavily in favor of Clinton in 2016. The DNC will also allow candidates who meet a grassroots fundraising threshold to participate in debates, regardless of how they're doing in the polls. And he is a main reason the Democratic candidates this year are advocating for progressive positions like Medicare-for-all and a $15 minimum wage. Ironically, Sanders' success in transforming the party may be part of what does him in, because there are now more options for the progressive left to choose from than in 2016. \"Does it have to be him?\" Arnie Arnesen, a New Hampshire radio show host and Sanders supporter in 2016, told NPR's Asma Khalid last month. \"I don't think it does, and I admire him. I admire him to pieces.\" Robert Camacho, center, cheers as California Sen. Kamala Harris launches her presidential campaign in Oakland, Calif., in January.\n                \n                    \n                    Noah Berger/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Robert Camacho, center, cheers as California Sen. Kamala Harris launches her presidential campaign in Oakland, Calif., in January. Sanders was known for having a cult-like following and huge crowds in 2016. But many of the Democratic candidates this year are also drawing packed crowds early in this campaign. Sen. Kamala Harris, for example, drew 20,000 people for her kickoff rally in Oakland, Calif. The big crowds are a likely sign of overall Democratic enthusiasm, with the base itching to take on Trump and try to stop him from reelection. Sanders has to fight the idea that the enthusiasm behind him can be replicated by others. He's also having to fight for the head and heart of his candidacy. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, for example, could potentially peel off from the intellectual, ideological part of Sanders' coalition (the head). And if former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke gets in, he threatens to pull from the emotional, grassroots piece of his base that wants to root for someone (the heart). Cohen said Sanders welcomes Warren as an \"ally,\" who is helping to rebuild the progressive base, and his team believes it can draw distinctions with O'Rourke to paint him as not as progressive, especially on trade. O'Rourke was one of just 28 House Democrats to support giving President Obama fast-track authority to negotiate trade deals, like the Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP. Whether he can hold onto it all \u2014 and expand to win a majority of delegates is an open question and major challenge. \"That's why we have 18 months until the convention to test that out,\" Cohen said. \"For people like me, it's about what kind of political world we build, not just the White House. It's about governing; it's the nature of the support base that will remain active, that you have an activist base, not just a candidate addiction.\" As far as competing with those other candidates, Cohen noted, \"The facts are quite clear \u2014 $6 million, 300,000 individual donors. Add up all the others, you don't get to that number.\" Sanders' path to victory \u2014 or defeat Sanders is one of the big fishes people were eagerly watching as he deliberated whether to run. And his entry is already giving some shape to how the contest could play out. The early states, for example, are likely going to take on even more significance now in winnowing the field. It's easy, for example, to see Sanders' winning path \u2014 and how he loses. Sanders nearly won Iowa, a caucus state, in 2016, and he won the New Hampshire primary handily, by 20 points. And those two early states take on extra significance for Sanders, who is not expected to be a major player in South Carolina, a state where 61 percent of Democratic voters in the 2016 primary were black. Hillary Clinton beat him there by almost 50 points. This year it's likely to be a battle between the two leading African-American candidates, Harris and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, and possibly Biden, if he decides to run. If Sanders sweeps Iowa and New Hamsphire this time, he might be hard to stop. If he loses one (especially New Hamsphire) or both, Sanders might have the money to continue, but winning a majority of delegates before the convention would be much more difficult. What's more, it's easy to see how New Hampshire will be the filter in a potential fight between Sanders and Warren, who are both from neighboring states. It will also mean higher stakes in Iowa for candidates like Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who is from bordering Minnesota, and Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio, another Midwesterner, to defeat Sanders.",

Amy Klobuchar , D-Minn., announces her candidacy for president during a snow fall on Feb. 10, 2019 in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Updated at 4:56 p.m. ET Minnesota Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar announced she's running for president on Sunday afternoon, joining a crowded and historically diverse field of candidates seeking to defeat President Trump. She is the fifth Democratic senator to launch a White House bid, with others still contemplating joining a primary field that has grown to 11 candidates. The three-term senator cast herself as a practical, Midwestern problem-solver focused on results, not ideology. \"We are tired of the shutdowns and the showdowns, of the gridlock and the grandstanding,\" said Klobuchar during a snowy, cold outdoor event in a park in Minneapolis. \"Our nation must be governed not by chaos but by opportunity.\" The 58-year-old Klobuchar was elected to the Senate in 2006 \u2014 the first elected female senator from Minnesota \u2014 and has been re-elected easily twice since. Before coming to Congress, she was the Hennepin County Attorney for eight years, serving as the chief prosecutor for the state's largest county, which includes Minneapolis. In that role, she secured almost 300 murder convictions and worked to curtail gun crimes. Her prosecutorial style was on display during last year's hearings for now-Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who was accused of sexual assault when he was younger. Klobuchar pressed Kavanaugh on whether he had ever been drinking so much he had blacked out and the defiant nominee threw the question back at her. Kavanaugh would later apologize, but the issue was deeply personal for Klobuchar, whose father, a well-known sports columnist in Minnesota, was an alcoholic. In the Senate, she's championed consumer protection issues, backed stricter online privacy regulations and worked on lowering the cost of prescription drugs. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., departs following a Medal of Freedom ceremony in the East Room of the White House.\n                \n                    \n                    Andrew Harnik/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., departs following a Medal of Freedom ceremony in the East Room of the White House. Klobuchar isn't as progressive as some of her potential Democratic competitors. She hasn't supported a Medicare for All plan, though she has said it \"should be considered,\" and she hasn't called for other far-left ideas such as abolishing Immigration and Customs Enforcement all together. Klobuchar is seen as more of a pragmatist on Capitol Hill, with her vote rankings typically putting her somewhat in the middle of the Democratic caucus. \"It is time to organize, time to galvanize, time to take back our democracy,\" said Klobuchar, who called for getting money out of politics, strengthening voting rights, combating global warming, reducing income inequality and making healthcare more affordable. Indirectly addressing President Trump, Klobuchar said, \"stop the fear-mongering and stop the hate.\" Compared to many of her colleagues, Klobuchar hasn't sought the media spotlight that much and doesn't have the same kind of social media or fundraising presence that some of her rivals do, a point she sought to counter in her announcement speech. \"I don't have a political machine. I don't come from money. But what I do have is this: I have grit,\" said Klobuchar. In the past week, Klobuchar has been dogged by anonymous, published accusations that she has mistreated her staff. Speaking to reporters after the announcement, Klobuchar didn't specifically deny any of the allegations. \"Yes, I can be tough,\" said Klobuchar. \"And, yes, I can push people. I know that. And I have high expectations for myself. I have high expectations for the people that work for me. But I have high expectations for this country. And that's what we need.\" Her presidential announcement is no surprise. She's been making political visits to neighboring Iowa for several years and has hinted for a long time she was seriously weighing a run. \"I will say that I have made very clear that I am looking at this,\" she told MSNBC on Jan. 15. \"I also had said I wanted to talk to my family, so big news today: My family is on board, including my in-laws, showing some momentum. But I will make this decision on my own course regardless of what other candidates are doing.\" She also has argued that her background and geographical base could help her in a general election, as opposed to other candidates. The Midwest helped Trump win his unexpected victory in 2016. Klobuchar has made the case that she could help Democrats be competitive in blue collar, rural areas where they've been lacking, giving off a possible \"Minnesota Nice\" vibe.  The title of her 2015 autobiography was The Senator Next Door: A Memoir from the Heartland. \"I think that there are a lot of good people considering this, but I do think you want voices from the Midwest. And I think you want to have people with different views running,\" Klobuchar told The New Yorker in Dec. 2018. Klobuchar is scheduled to head to Iowa again later this month, with a speaking engagement on Feb. 21 outside Des Moines.",

John Hickenlooper (left) and Montana Gov. Steve Bullock at a 2016 Western Governors' Association meeting in Coronado, Calif. They are two Democrats considering running for president in 2020 with a message of pragmatism and bipartisan accomplishment. In the final years of John Hickenlooper's time as Colorado governor, the Democrat had a rule about President Trump. \"I didn't let anyone in my office \u2014 no one could mention his name, because then we'd talk for 30 or 40 minutes and never get anything done. You could talk about it endlessly,\" he said. As Hickenlooper considers a run for the White House, it's clear the former governor is worried the Democratic primary could play out the same way: an endless, circular argument about how terrible the Trump administration is, without much emphasis on what Democratic candidates would do in his place. \"I think it's essential that we beat President Trump, but it's not sufficient,\" Hickenlooper said. He is one of several current or former Democratic governors considering a 2020 presidential campaign. Many of them, like Hickenlooper, are positioning themselves as pragmatists willing to cut deals with Republicans in order to achieve results. That's a sharp contrast from many of the high-profile senators who are largely running campaigns centered around resisting and fighting Trump. In an increasingly crowded primary, the question for Hickenlooper, Montana Gov. Steve Bullock and others is whether charged-up Democratic voters will opt for governing over grievances. \"I'm optimistic that we can demonstrate that while we may have our differences at times, Republicans and Democrats can work together in Montana to get things done,\" Bullock pointedly told the Montana Legislature during his State of the State address last week. \"And we can do it without ever shutting down a government.\" To be clear, neither Bullock nor Hickenlooper are framing themselves as Howard Schultz-style centrists placing blame for political stalemate on both parties, but rather as Democrats who are able to negotiate. Hickenlooper points to gun control measures he signed into law and environmental standards capping greenhouse gas emissions at oil and gas-drilling sites, while Bullock regularly steers the conversation toward the Medicaid expansion he ushered through Montana's Republican Legislature. The former Colorado governor recently visited Iowa and South Carolina and says he'll make a final decision on whether to run next month. Bullock hasn't declared a run either, but he has been much more aggressive in staking out early primary and caucus states. He was campaigning in Iowa last April and making the rounds on cable news in the days after the 2018 midterms. \"We actually, by working hard, got Medicaid expansion passed. Earned income tax credit, record investments in public education,\" he told MSNBC's Morning Joe that week. \"One of the most progressive laws in the country, saying if you're going to spend in our elections, you have to disclose where that money comes from.\" And in a political environment where many Democratic voters say their top priority is finding a candidate who can beat Trump, Bullock is quick to point out he won re-election in Montana on the same night Trump carried the state by 20 points. Bullock's potential campaign recently hit a speed bump, when news broke that a staffer he fired from the Democratic Governors Association for sexual harassment went on to harass more women after taking a new job working for New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio. \"Should I have called Mayor de Blasio? Should I have let more people know?\" Bullock wrote in a recent Medium post. \"Was I naive to think this wouldn't happen again? The answer is yes. I was wrong and naive to think I did enough.\" Longtime Democratic strategist Paul Begala says a year from the first caucuses, a lot is unclear. But one consistent theme is that Democratic voters want to find a candidate who can win. He sees the appeal of a candidate who can say I've won \u2014 and gotten results \u2014 in a red or purple state. \"Democrats would surrender or compromise on Medicare-for-all, or Green New Deal, or taxes or anything, if it would guarantee them that a Democrat would replace Donald Trump,\" Begala said. \"So I think this is likely to be a less ideologically-driven primary.\" But there's another constant theme from Democratic voters that may clash with the urge for a candidate who can win GOP votes: a deep, lasting anger at President Trump. Hickenlooper is quick to acknowledge it. \"I think there is so much frustration at the national level, and I think President Trump has created this, so that the one way that people can demonstrate quickly and firmly that they are against Trump is to show anger and really lash out \u2014 at either President Trump or someone \u2014 to demonstrate that they have the same values as the Democratic primary voters. And I understand, I feel that,\" Hickenlooper said. \"But I think there might be a kind of a new silent majority of people that are also going to want to see achievement.\" Washington Gov. Jay Inslee is also visiting early primary states, focusing his potential campaign on climate change. Former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe is considering a run, too. All these Democratic governors would face an uphill battle in a crowded race dominated early on by national stars like Elizabeth Warren. While Warren, Harris, Booker and other D.C.-based lawmakers are capturing most of the attention right now, Begala points out that governors have a much better track record at making it to the White House. \"We cover the senators because they're close by and we know them,\" Begala said. \"But if you look at our history, the people we make president tend to be, well, incumbent presidents, current or former vice presidents, Civil War generals \u2014 so far only on the Union side \u2014 and governors.\" As crowded as the 2020 Democratic field may become, there likely won't be any Civil War generals in the mix. So perhaps, Begala argues, it's worth keeping an eye on the governors.",

Cory Booker, D-N.J., visits Masterpiece Barber College as he campaigns for Nevada Democratic candidates in October in Las Vegas. Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey is the latest Democrat to enter the increasingly crowded race for the White House, making the initial announcement with a message of unity. \"We are better when we help each other,\" Booker says in a video message. \"I believe that we can build a country where no one is forgotten, no one is left behind; where parents can put food on the table; where there are good-paying jobs with good benefits in every neighborhood; where our criminal justice system keeps us safe instead of shuffling more children into cages and coffins; where we see the faces of our leaders on television and feel pride, not shame.\" The video sets the tone for a campaign that's expected to counter President Trump's divisive, base-focused politics with a conscious emphasis on big-picture themes of common purpose and love overcoming political divisions. I\u2019m running for president. Join me on this journey. https://t.co/fEDqOVIfwh pic.twitter.com/h1FTPUYRzo Booker's goal, he told NPR in 2017, is \"not to meet hate with hate, but meet it with love. Not to meet darkness with darkness, but meet it with light. I really do think we're at a moral moment in our country. The only way we can move this country in the way it needs to go is not at pointing other people about what they're doing, but turning up the values we believe in.\" Booker planned a series of media appearances as part of his rollout on Friday, including The Tom Joyner Morning Show, Univision's Despierta America and ABC's The View. The 49-year-old Booker, a former Newark mayor who was first elected to the Senate in a 2013 special election, has long been seen as a likely candidate to challenge Trump. He made it apparent he was likely to run with a couple of strategic moves, joining the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in 2017, as well as making frequent trips to early primary voting states such as Iowa and New Hampshire to raise money and campaign for local candidates in the 2018 midterm elections. His trips left a positive impression with several political professionals in the early primary and caucus states. Jim Demers, who co-chaired Barack Obama's 2008 New Hampshire campaign, told NPR that Booker has \"built his career on a message of unity. And I think that people all across the country are tired of how divided Americans have become.\" Even before he was elected to the Senate, Booker had amassed a national following as Newark's mayor, primarily due to his early embrace of Twitter and other social media platforms. He attracted attention to causes such as homelessness and shortcomings of the federal food stamp program by going on hunger strikes and temporarily living in a tent, among other highly publicized moves. Booker also regularly interacted with constituents on Twitter. When someone tweeted that her elderly father needed help shoveling his driveway, Booker showed up to do it. He also once ran into a fire, saving a woman's life while suffering smoke inhalation and burns. Booker has continued this approach in the Senate. During the height of the Republican push to repeal the Affordable Care Act, Booker drew attention to the debate by holding a sit-in on the steps of the Senate with other Democrats, and livestreaming the event for hours. Those efforts have, at times, backfired. During the Supreme Court confirmation hearings for Brett Kavanaugh last fall, Booker dramatically threatened to release confidential documents from Kavanaugh's time in the Bush White House, even though, as he claimed, \"the penalty comes with potential ousting from the Senate.\" Booker called it his \"Spartacus moment,\" but the drama was significantly deflated when it became clear that the documents in question already had been approved for public release. In the Senate, Booker has been a strong advocate of overhauling the criminal justice system. He was an original co-sponsor of the First Step Act, bipartisan legislation passed in December that addresses drug sentencing and rehabilitation for inmates leaving prison. He was also one of the first senators to call for legalizing marijuana. Booker is an advocate of Medicare for all, raising the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour and a job guarantee program. He's also been a strong opponent of Trump's Cabinet appointments. While his savvy on both social and traditional media earned him a high profile, Booker also has faced criticism from progressives for appearing too close to both Wall Street and pharmaceutical companies, a major industry in New Jersey. And as a surrogate for the 2012 Obama campaign, Booker admonished Democratic criticism of GOP nominee Mitt Romney's business career, saying: \"Stop attacking private equity.\" In 2017, Booker told NPR that he stopped taking donations from the pharmaceutical industry, previously a prominent source of his campaign funds. In recent years he has co-sponsored a measure, along with Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., to legalize pharmaceutical imports from Canada, and has been increasingly more outspoken about high drug prices. The New Jersey Democrat is the fourth senator to announce a run for president, joining Sens. Elizabeth Warren, Kirsten Gillibrand and Kamala Harris. Booker is the second black candidate in the increasingly large and diverse 2020 Democratic primary field. Booker and Harris have worked together on the Senate Judiciary Committee and have a close relationship but are expected to compete for the support of African-American voters \u2014 a key constituency in a Democratic primary.",

Kamala Harris, D-Calif., at an Oakland, Calif., campaign rally this week. Harris says she backs a single-payer health system, but she hasn't yet offered details on how she would finance that plan. \"Medicare-for-all,\" once widely considered a fringe proposal for providing health care in the U.S., is getting more popular. Several Democratic presidential hopefuls are getting behind the idea. Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., endorsed the approach  Monday in a CNN town hall-style event, saying her aim would be to eliminate all private insurance. \"Who of us has not had that situation, where you've got to wait for approval and the doctor says, well, 'I don't know if your insurance company is going to cover this,' \" Harris said. \"Let's eliminate all of that. Let's move on.\" Harris was a co-sponsor of a 2017 bill written by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., that would have created a national, single-payer health system, eliminating the private insurance system. Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., both presidential hopefuls, also co-sponsored the Sanders bill. Everyone would get a Medicare card and doctors would have to sign annual agreements to participate. The major questions the candidates face is how the government would pay for it. Total spending on health care in the U.S. was about $3.5 trillion in 2017 and is forecast to rise to $5.7 trillion in 2026, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. The federal government already pays for a lot of that through Medicare, Medicaid, military health care and the Department of Veterans Affairs. Much of the rest is through employer health insurance plans and individual health insurance and payments by patients. Sanders laid out several options to pay for his proposal, including increasing taxes on employers who would no longer be paying insurance premiums; increasing individual income taxes; and boosting taxes on the wealthy. Harris didn't say, in the town hall-style meeting, how she would pay for the program. And her Senate office didn't respond to an email asking whether she has a funding proposal. Warren has proposed a 2 percent tax on the wealth of an individual that's above $50 million and 3 percent on wealth of more than $1 billion. The mechanism for paying for \"Medicare-for-all\" can make the politics muddy. A recent poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation suggests that 56 percent of people in the U.S. like the idea overall. But when people heard more details, those numbers changed. When the question included the idea that \"Medicare-for-all\" would guarantee health insurance as a right, its support rose to 71 percent. But when it said people would have to pay more taxes, the popularity plummeted to 37 percent. That dynamic has created an opening for potential centrist candidates to stake out a middle road. Howard Schultz, the former CEO of Starbucks, who has said he is considering a presidential run, told CBS reporters that Harris' proposal to eliminate the health insurance industry is \"not American.\" He also called proposed tax increases on the wealthy \"punitive.\" Mike Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York and founder of Bloomberg LP, who is also considering a run,  said in New Hampshire Tuesday that he, too, opposed the idea. \"To replace the entire private system where companies provide health care for their employees would bankrupt us for a very long time,\" he told workers at a factory he was visiting. Bloomberg has said he supports opening Medicare to people who don't have coverage through their employers. The health insurance industry is already gearing up to oppose any \"Medicare-for-all\" proposals, according to The Intercept, an investigative news website.",

Sanders won that primary, but today some of his supporters in the early primary state are less enthusiastic about another presidential bid.\n                \n                    \n                    Scott Eisen/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., leads a November 2015 rally in front of the New Hampshire State House in Concord. Sanders won that primary, but today some of his supporters in the early primary state are less enthusiastic about another presidential bid. In the spring of 2015, before Bernie Sanders had a campaign office in New Hampshire, Elizabeth Ropp, an acupuncturist, was making homemade signs for the Vermont senator. \"Bernie inspired me because as somebody who's lived without health insurance for most of my adult life, I want there to be a single-payer health care system,\" she said. She was disappointed Sanders wasn't the nominee and is convinced that if he had been, Donald Trump would not be president. \"I want to see Bernie run again in 2020,\" said Ropp. \"We need Bernie to run even if the field is crowded.\" The 77-year-old Vermont senator has not announced his plans, but he has sparked plenty of speculation. In 2016, Sanders created a powerful progressive movement in a thin primary field. The dilemma for him now is that nearly every other Democratic presidential contender is adopting his positions on issues like health care and minimum wage, which means progressive voters in 2020 have plenty of other choices. \"Medicare-for-all,\" $15 minimum wage Earlier this month, when Sanders reintroduced a bill to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour, every Democrat in the Senate who's rumored to be considering a run for president co-sponsored his legislation: Sherrod Brown, Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker, Kirsten Gillibrand, Kamala Harris and Amy Klobuchar. Arnie Arnesen considers herself Sanders' ideological twin. She \"admires him to pieces,\" but she thinks he could play a more important role in 2020 by staying out of the race for president.\n                \n                    \n                    Asma Khalid/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Arnie Arnesen considers herself Sanders' ideological twin. She \"admires him to pieces,\" but she thinks he could play a more important role in 2020 by staying out of the race for president. \"He has made it legitimate to talk about things that a lot of us used to mumble,\" said Arnie Arnesen, a radio show host and former New Hampshire politician who thinks of herself as Sanders' ideological twin. Arnesen says she's grateful that he ran in 2016 because he helped \"expose some of the rot\" in her own party. Sanders has helped change the Democratic National Committee rules for selecting a nominee, curtailing the role of superdelegates and shaped the current Democratic economic message. But Arnesen wonders whether he's the right candidate for the White House. \"My question is, does he provide added value in this campaign for 2020? Or are there a lot of people who sort of carry very similar messages?\" asked Arnesen, before answering her own question. \"Does it have to be him? I don't think it does, and I admire him. I admire him to pieces.\" The clearest example of the change is Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, who resigned as vice chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee so she could endorse Sanders in the 2016 primary. Gabbard recently launched her own presidential bid. Not the only progressive option Sanders' first decisive victory in 2016 came in the New Hampshire primary; he crushed Hillary Clinton there by 22 percentage points. And activists like Andru Volinsky were part of the reason he did so well. Volinsky, Sanders' New Hampshire campaign lawyer during the 2016 primary, said that if the Vermont senator were to run for president again, he would be his top choice. But it's unclear whether Volinsky personally wants Sanders to run. \"I want a strong advocate for addressing issues like income inequality and health care access and climate action,\" said Volinsky. \"Sen. Sanders could be that strong voice. There are some others that could as well.\" Many voters who strongly backed Sanders in 2016 say they realize Sanders is not necessarily the only progressive option in 2020. For some, that's confusing, but for others, it's appealing. Arnesen is excited by many of the candidates considering a run for the presidency; many of them, she believes, carry elements of Sanders' message. For example, Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown, she says, has a lot of the same \"authenticity\" as Sanders \"without being 80 years old\" when he's elected (Sanders turns 79 in 2020). \"I think it's time for us to start creating a new bench,\" said Arnesen.\"And the new bench isn't old, it shouldn't be white, and it probably shouldn't be male.\" Some Sanders supporters also say the political environment has changed since 2016 and they want a candidate who can win. \"Electability has leaped to the forefront for me,\" said Ron Abramson, an immigration lawyer who served as a Sanders delegate to the DNC. \"I am prepared to support anyone who can help restore some measure of sanity [and] humanity.\" Those sentiments are not an isolated feeling. \"We're looking for somebody right now who can stand up to the nasty, nasty campaign that our idiot-in-chief the president is gonna run in 2020,\" said Bill Stelling, an activist who runs an art gallery in Manchester. Stelling is not convinced Sanders is the right person for that job. Even though he was \"hugely inspired\" by Sanders' message in 2016 and donated to the Vermont senator's campaign, these days, he's impressed with California Sen. Kamala Harris; he thinks she's \"fearless.\" He's also intrigued by Beto O'Rourke, the former Texas congressman who tried to unseat Republican Sen. Ted Cruz last year. This week, Stelling is going to a \"Draft Beto\" house party. He wanted to spread the word, so he posted a note about the meeting on Facebook but was disheartened by the response. \"I immediately got some snarky comments from progressives,\" said Stelling. \"It's so counterproductive.\" But loyal Sanders supporters are unyielding in their devotion to the Vermont senator, because, they insist, he is the only one pushing the Democratic Party to the left. \"The other candidates are trying to posture themselves based on the assumption that Bernie Sanders is going to run,\" said Tim Smith, a four-term state legislator in Manchester and early Sanders supporter in the 2016 primary. \"They don't want to be seen as being members of the conservative wing of the party.\"",

            "article_content": "California Democratic Sen. Kamala Harris announced she is running for president Monday, joining a growing Democratic field that was present at Martin Luther King Jr. Day events around the country.  AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: California Senator Kamala Harris announced her bid for the White House today and says she welcomes the large field of Democrats expected in the 2020 campaign. Harris visited her alma mater Howard University in Washington to take questions from the press. NPR political correspondent Asma Khalid was there. She joins us now. Hey there, Asma. ASMA KHALID, BYLINE: Hey, Audie. CORNISH: It's been clear for a while that the senator has been thinking about running. Can you talk about the timing? KHALID: Yeah. Well, I mean, I think there is clearly a symbolic element to announcing her candidacy on MLK Day. You know, she spoke about the inspiration that she takes from the civil rights movement, the role that that movement had in her parents' lives. But she also talks a lot about her record for pushing racial justice and pointed to a program that she led in California that she says kind of shut the revolving door in the criminal justice system. It shut down recidivism rates, so you could get people who've gotten out of jail to essentially stay out of jail. You know, she's also out there pushing college affordability, \"Medicare-for-all\" - all these things that, truthfully, don't really sound that unique this cycle because, essentially, every Democrat is pushing for those things. I think what we see that's really unique in her, though, is that she is leaning into her record as a prosecutor. CORNISH: Right. And that is meaningful because in a Democratic primary, obviously, with the progressive politics around criminal justice reform and things like that, it sounds like maybe she's trying to get ahead of it. KHALID: That's right. I mean, she does have some concerns that young, progressive voters of color do have some concerns about the criminal justice system and policing. And she was the attorney general of California and a top prosecutor in San Francisco. And, you know, she's talked about this. She's talked about regretting some of the decisions that she and her office had to make. But she also feels like that experience gives her insights into the problems about how, you know, we all need to fix some of those things. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KAMALA HARRIS: There is a lot about what I did as a prosecutor that I'm proud of, including a recognition that there are fundamental flaws in the criminal justice system and that this criminal justice system needs to be reformed. KHALID: And so, Audie, from here, she's got a rally planned on Friday with some sorority sisters in South Carolina. She'll then head to her hometown, Oakland, Calif. And then it is on to Iowa for her. CORNISH: Now, a lot of other Democrats who are also thinking about a presidential run were out at King Day events, right? What are you hearing about them? KHALID: Well, I was at a breakfast this morning here in Washington, D.C., with the Reverend Al Sharpton. Former Vice President Joe Biden was there. He was being honored. And I think what's really interesting is that if Biden were to get into this race, I think there are some questions that people, specifically in different communities of color, have around his support for a '90s-era crime bill. He came closer today than I have ever heard him before in acknowledging some regrets around that. He said that it was a big mistake that was made and that it trapped an entire generation. A lot of Democrats this election cycle are talking more and more, it seems like, about systemic racism or institutional racism. And that's also something I heard from Joe Biden today. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JOE BIDEN: The bottom line is we have a lot to root out. But most of all, the systematic racism that most of us whites don't like to acknowledge even exists. We don't even consciously acknowledge it, but it's been built into every aspect of our system. KHALID: And, Audie, we also heard today from a couple of women who've said that they're running for president. That's Senator Elizabeth Warren and Senator Kirsten Gillibrand. They were among several other Democrats who were out today at rallies and different events. And what I'm noticing in listening to these candidates this year is how much more direct they seem to be willing to talk about race and racism than I've heard in previous election cycles. There's an emphasis that it seems they're putting on racism as a fairly large problem in our society. And, you know, of course, this is MLK Day. I think we sort of expect them to talk about these issues today. But I will say it's something I've also heard in announcement videos, and even on the trail in Iowa so far. CORNISH: That's NPR's Asma Khalid. Thank you so much for your insight. KHALID: You're welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) Copyright \u00a9 2019 NPR.  All rights reserved.
