Blake Farenthold, R-Texas, during a mock ceremony in January. Farenthold reached a private 2015 settlement for $84,000 with his former communications director over sexual harassment allegations. Party leaders played a pivotal role in forcing the resignations of three members of Congress within three days this week, and their work might not be done yet. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., were instrumental in the respective resignations of Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn., and Rep. Trent Franks, R-Ariz. (Franks announced his resignation was effective Friday after he said his wife was admitted to the hospital.) Two additional congressmen, one Republican and one Democrat, also face allegations of sexual harassment and growing calls to resign, but so far they are resisting those calls. Rep. Blake Farenthold, R-Texas, reached a private 2015 settlement for $84,000 with his former communications director over sexual harassment allegations. Politico first reported on the details of the previously private settlement, including that it was paid for by taxpayers. Farenthold denies any wrongdoing, but announced this week that he would reimburse the Treasury out of pocket. The House Ethics Committee announced late Thursday that it was reviving its inquiry into the allegations, citing more information that has been disclosed and a willingness from Farenthold and his former aide to participate in an investigation. Only two of Farenthold's colleagues, GOP Reps. Barbara Comstock of Virginia and Mia Love of Utah, have so far called for him to resign. The speaker has not called on Farenthold to go but the renewed ethics investigation could affect Republicans' calculations. Democratic leaders have been swift to condemn Rep. Ruben Kihuen, D-Nev., and call for his resignation of allegations first reported by BuzzFeed that he sexually harassed a woman who worked on his 2016 campaign and quit over his behavior. Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chairman Ben Ray Lujan and Pelosi quickly called for him to resign over the allegations, but Kihuen is pushing back. \"I do find it interesting that the DCCC, Leader [Nancy] Pelosi and Chairman Ben Ray Lujan, they knew about these allegations last year,\" Kihuen told ABC News. \"They looked into them. They didn't find anything, and they continued investing millions of dollars in my campaign. They went out there and campaigned for me.\" Pelosi and Lujan deny that they knew or that any investigation occurred. There is no clear standard for forced resignations, and there are simmering frustrations among conservatives and liberals alike that lawmakers are being tossed overboard without any conclusive evidence to prove that what they did was wrong. It's further complicated by the argument that some politicians have made \u2014 most notably with President Trump in the case of Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore \u2014 that ultimately the voters should get to decide their fates. Capitol Hill has for years been intolerant to lawmakers accused of any kind of sexually charged bad behavior. Already this year, Pennsylvania Republican Rep. Tim Murphy, a social conservative, resigned over extramarital affairs and allegations that he wanted a mistress to have an abortion. While the knee-jerk urge of Congress is to purge lawmakers over sexual impropriety, there is also a long history of lawmakers who have weathered the allegations, won re-election and left on their own terms. For instance, Sen. David Vitter, R-La., admitted to using prostitutes in 2007. He refused to resign and won re-election three years later. He retired on his own terms in 2017. Tennessee Rep. Scott DesJarlais weathered allegations over extramarital affairs and pressuring a woman to have an abortion. He has won re-election three times. Whether or not Farenthold and Kihuen can withstand growing pressure to bow out is an open question on Capitol Hill, and with no clear metric for when a lawmaker should resign, there is fresh pressures on party leaders to be the ones who set the standard.",

            "article_content": "After news that he asked a woman with whom he had an affair to get an abortion, Pennsylvania Republican Rep. Tim Murphy announced he won't seek re-election. He's a member of the House Pro-Life Caucus.  DAVID GREENE, HOST: Pennsylvania Republican Congressman Tim Murphy says he will not be running for re-election next year. This comes after reports that the anti-abortion congressman had asked his mistress to terminate a pregnancy. Katie Blackley of member station WESA in Pittsburgh reports. KATIE BLACKLEY, BYLINE: Local newspapers revealed a series of text messages between Murphy and the woman he was having an affair with in which he asked her to abort their unborn child during a pregnancy scare. The woman criticized the GOP congressman in the messages saying he had zero issue talking about his anti-abortion position less than a week after asking her to terminate her pregnancy. Murphy says in a statement that he'll be taking personal time to seek help. Earlier this week, Murphy voted to ban nearly all abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy. He's a member of the House Pro-Life Caucus and has consistently advocated against using federal funding for abortion services. In 2010, he told a crowd at the Right to Life Convention in Pittsburgh that he believed every life is important. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TIM MURPHY: Every kid deserves a chance to have a choice at life. Every child deserves a chance to have a choice at life. Every baby deserves a chance to have a choice at life, and every parent should be supported in their responsibility and commitment to raise that child. BLACKLEY: His affair came to light last month when the woman's divorce proceedings were made public. Although Murphy is not a part of the case, court documents revealed the affair lasted about six months. A practicing psychologist, Murphy is in his eighth term representing southwestern Pennsylvania, which voted for Donald Trump by a 2-3 margin last year. For NPR News, I'm Katie Blackley.

            "article_content": "As Democrats prepare for next year's mid-term elections, some want the party to embrace abortion opponents. Others argue reproductive rights are a non-negotiable Democratic value.  STACEY VANEK SMITH, HOST: As Democrats lick their wounds from the 2016 election and look ahead to the 2018 midterms, abortion is emerging as a surprisingly divisive issue. Some party members want to make room for Democrats who oppose abortion rights. Others say reproductive freedom is non-negotiable and a core Democratic Party value. NPR's Sarah McCammon has more. SARAH MCCAMMON, BYLINE: When the chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee told a reporter this week that there would be no litmus test on abortion rights for candidates receiving financial support, it opened up another chapter in an ongoing debate over how to energize the party's base while also broadening its appeal. New Mexico Congressman Ben Ray Lujan said the priority should be finding Democratic candidates who can win their districts. There was quick pushback from abortion rights activists, like NARAL President Ilyse Hogue. ILYSE HOGUE: Having access to abortion is ground zero for gender equality. It is linked to every other decision that women will ever make in their life. MCCAMMON: NARAL, Planned Parenthood and several other groups released a joint statement this week arguing that reproductive rights must be part of any conversation about issues like jobs and education. Hogue points to the women's march the day after President Trump's inauguration as a sign that Democrats can't afford to back down on issues important to many of them, like abortion rights. HOGUE: If there was ever a stronger signal sent that women are looking for leadership who has our backs because equality and justice is more important in the Trump administration than it's ever been, that moment is now. MCCAMMON: Other Democrats argue that in the wake of their party's losses in 2016, it's time to reach out to voters who have some common ground with Democrats but oppose abortion rights. Polls suggest at least a fifth of Democrats label themselves pro-life. Kristen Day of the group Democrats For Life (ph) says the party should reach out to them. KRISTEN DAY: When you're looking at campaigns, every vote matters. And we cannot afford to tell these people that they don't belong and they can't vote Democrat if they hold these beliefs. MCCAMMON: In areas like the Midwest and South, with a large share of religious conservatives, Day says Democrats should run candidates who reflect local values. DAY: You can't take the values of California and New York and expect to take a candidate and win in the middle America. MCCAMMON: It's not the first time this issue has come up in recent months. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi has said she believes it is possible to be a Democrat and oppose abortion. Senator Bernie Sanders, known as a progressive leader, has argued it's more important to win control of Congress and state legislatures than to insist that all Democrats support abortion rights. Meanwhile, Republicans are seizing on this intraparty fight as a sign of a larger problem for Democrats. Lindsay Jancek is with the Republican National Committee. LINDSAY JANCEK: They really don't have a message, and they're not sure what direction to go. And they're concerned about their races coming up in 2018, that I think, you know, they're going to face a lot of tests and trials and tribulations from voters. MCCAMMON: Andrea Flynn, a fellow at the left-leaning Roosevelt Institute, says Democrats risk trying too hard to win over white, working-class voters who supported Trump at the expense of the base that turned out twice for President Obama. ANDREA FLYNN: But I think a bigger question for progressives to be asking right now is, how do we rebuild the progressive coalition? How do we create a narrative and an agenda that speaks to people of color, that speaks to immigrants, that speaks to women who have been the backbone of this party? MCCAMMON: Flynn says Democrats would do well to focus not only on getting the message right on abortion but also on the economic concerns that mobilize voters across the political spectrum.

A Senate election in Alabama. A Republican tax bill moving through Congress. Violent protests in the Middle East following U.S. recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. What could these widely disparate matters have in common, besides heavy news coverage? It turns out that they all have enabled President Trump to send a message to one distinct and crucial category of his supporters. It is not that evangelicals think Trump is one of them, but rather that they believe he is being used by God. As the Bible says, 'By their fruits ye shall know them,' (Matthew 7:20) and so far Trump's crop has looked pretty good. We are talking about white evangelical Protestants, especially the core of \"born again\" or \"fundamentalist\" believers among them. As voters, they went overwhelmingly for Trump in 2016 \u2014 more than 80 percent in the November election, according to exit polls \u2014 the highest degree of loyalty the group has ever shown a presidential candidate. These same voters are today disproportionately numerous within that shrinking fraction of Americans who still approve of Trump's performance in office (which is down to roughly a third in the Gallup and other polls). In return, these loyal backers should find some special gifts under their Christmas trees this year, not the least of which is President Trump's preference for celebrating \"Christmas\" rather than \"the holiday season.\" All this comes as a surprise to those who had thought Trump an improbable champion for people who prioritize religion. The last president to have this kind of support from \"born again\" white evangelicals was George W. Bush, who had a storied past as a party boy but also a conversion story worthy of the biblical prodigal son. When asked in a presidential debate to name his favorite political philosopher, he named Jesus. Trump, on the other hand, has no such personal testimony. He has an ancestral association with the Presbyterians but has never been known as a churchman. Indeed, he has made his way in the worldliest of worldly occupations and appeared on the cover of Playboy. His three marriages and serial sexual episodes are scarcely the stuff of Sunday school lessons. He has said he does not feel a need to repent or ask forgiveness. And when he tried to show familiarity with a Bible verse last year by saying it was from \"Two Corinthians,\" actual Bible readers everywhere either laughed out loud or cringed. So it surprises some to see how readily many committed church people flock to his standard. But the explanation is both simple and neat. It is not that evangelicals think Trump is one of them, but rather that they believe he is being used by God. As the Bible says, \"By their fruits ye shall know them,\" (Matthew 7:20) and so far Trump's crop has looked pretty good. The reasoning then follows like this: Trump may not seem worthy as an instrument of the Lord's will, but that judgment is not ours to make and belongs to someone else. So as long as Trump seems to be doing the Lord's work, Trump will be just fine with the people of the Lord. Trump gets his best support among those evangelicals who are most conservative, both politically and theologically. They are the most likely both to be Republican and to take the Bible as the literal word of God \u2014 or \"jot and tittle,\" as some used to say. They are staunchly anti-abortion and opposed to same sex-marriage (or same-sex liaisons of any kind). They strongly favor the return of prayer in the schools and of explicitly Christian prayers at public events. They do not want transgender people in the military, or in their bathrooms. Trump had already changed his positions on salient social issues such as these in the 2016 Republican primaries, where he did surprisingly well among self-described religious conservatives (especially in the crucial South Carolina primary). Some expected him to switch back in the general election, or in office. Instead, he doubled down on commitments to these voters in the fall, emphasizing a pledge to appoint Supreme Court justices in the mold of the late Antonin Scalia. His first appointee, Justice Neil Gorsuch, was a promise fulfilled. Yet Trump continued to deliver after that, as a scan of one recent week's news stories clearly demonstrates. Moore for the core President Trump walks onstage, as he holds a rally in Pensacola, Fla., earlier this month, where he endorsed Alabama Republican candidate Roy Moore. Moore lost Tuesday to Democrat Doug Jones.\n                \n                    \n                    Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption President Trump walks onstage, as he holds a rally in Pensacola, Fla., earlier this month, where he endorsed Alabama Republican candidate Roy Moore. Moore lost Tuesday to Democrat Doug Jones. Let's start with Alabama, where longtime hero of the ultraright Roy Moore came within a hair's breadth of claiming a seat in the U.S. Senate. Moore is revered by many religious conservatives for his stone Ten Commandments monument and his adamant refusal to enforce U.S. Supreme Court orders on same-sex marriage. Those issues had caused him to be removed as chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court \u2014 not once, but twice. Moore's explicit use of religion (his campaign events often resembled revival meetings) had been central to his political persona for years. But it became especially critical after multiple women accused him of sexually harassing or assaulting them when they were teenagers (and he was not). Many GOP leaders urged Moore to withdraw, but not Trump. In fact, the president soon slid from \"let the people of Alabama decide\" to full-throated exhortations to \"vote Roy Moore.\" He held a rally just across the state line practically on the eve of the vote, shouting his support for Moore. Surely the president had every reason to back the nominee of his party when its margin of Senate majority is so slim. But he also needed to be in the corner of the people who still passionately believed in Moore as a bona fide modern Christian martyr. The sense of being persecuted in contemporary America and besieged by global Islam is a common conviction among many of the president's backers. These include millions of families who have withdrawn from the public school system, educating their children in church or charter schools or at home to escape the secularism and perceived hostility to religion in the public schools. Many of these families will be among the favored groups finding special blessings in the tax bill Congress is set to pass this week. Thanks to Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and others, people who opt out of the public school system will get access to tax-advantaged savings plans to help pay for their alternatives. In one disappointment for many religious activists, the tax bill leaves intact a provision of the IRS code forbidding the active promotion of candidates for political office by churches \u2014 unless they want to risk losing their tax-exempt status. But even that defeat serves to spotlight Trump's highly visible efforts to remove that provision on the activists' behalf. He even organized a last-minute effort to lobby for its removal with allies such as Ralph Reed. (Once famous as the leader of the Christian Coalition, Reed is now billed as the founder of the Faith and Freedom Coalition.) Back to Jerusalem The Church of the Holy Sepulchre is seen in the Old City in Jerusalem earlier this month. The \"final status\" of Jerusalem as a formal matter remains a major sticking point in negotiations at the heart of the Middle East peace process.\n                \n                    \n                    Chris McGrath/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption The Church of the Holy Sepulchre is seen in the Old City in Jerusalem earlier this month. The \"final status\" of Jerusalem as a formal matter remains a major sticking point in negotiations at the heart of the Middle East peace process. Trump supporters on the religious right sometimes point to Trump antecedents in the Bible, where the Lord used one imperfect vessel after another to work his will. One was the Persian conqueror Cyrus, who allowed some of the Judeans captive in his country to return home and rebuild the Temple of Solomon around the year 500 B.C. (Check out the Old Testament book of Ezra for more details.) That example is relevant, because Jerusalem and the temple remain live issues today, 25 centuries later. Trump's recent decision to recognize Jerusalem as the official capital of Israel (and to move the U.S. Embassy there) has set off deadly riots in much of the region. It has also resonated deeply with some Americans who fervently support it. \"Evangelicals are ecstatic about this move,\" said the Rev. Jim Jeffress of the First Baptist Church of Dallas on Fox News. Such extreme reactions, both negative and positive, tend to leave many news consumers bemused. Most Americans probably thought Jerusalem already was the capital of Israel. It's certainly a better-known news dateline than Tel Aviv. Yet the \"final status\" of Jerusalem as a formal matter is a major sticking point in negotiations at the heart of the Middle East peace process. Generations of diplomats have wrestled over the control of the city's holy sites and the city's role in resolving the larger Palestinian issue. That's why Muslims everywhere are upset at Trump's jumping the gun. Jews favor Jerusalem as the capital, but many also support the notion of a negotiated settlement. Trump, though, seems more focused on the view of those conservative Christians who see this step as fulfilling a key biblical prophecy. In this view, Jerusalem needs to be available as the site of the Third Temple, a necessary precondition for the end times or last things that are essential to many fundamentalist Christians' faith. This is where the water gets a little deep, so we won't wade in too far. But suffice it to say that at some point in time, according to various passages in the Bible, Jews will be in possession of Jerusalem and a new temple will be erected. Thereafter will come the Antichrist and a period to be known as the Tribulation. It gets harrowing, but, cutting to the chase, Christ himself will return to Earth in triumph and glory and all true believers will be united with him in heaven. How much of this Trump personally understands or buys into is open to debate. But he has shown a keen desire to court those who take the prophecy at face value and with all their hearts. That courtship has been highly successful, at least so far. One last reason the president has a connection to these elements of his following is their shared sense of themselves as outsiders. They are populists pushing back against the judgments of the elite and against the establishment in religion and in government. And for now, at least, what unites Trump with these unlikely allies outweighs whatever divides them.",

            "article_content": "Rachel Martin has been talking to voters about the state's Senate race. A church pastor explains why he's backing GOP candidate Roy Moore despite multiple allegations of sexual misconduct and assault.  MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: And with our colleague Rachel Martin, who's reporting from Birmingham today. Rachel, good morning. I hope the coffee is strong and plentiful there in Alabama for you. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: Coffee is flowing, for sure. It is Election Day. It's a big day here in Alabama. Voters are going to the polls in a special election to pick their next U.S. senator, and the choice, Mary Louise, is between the Republican, Roy Moore, and the Democrat in this race, Doug Jones. And leading up to this day, the race was very close. The polls were neck and neck, which is significant because this is a very red state, so the fact that the Democrat, Doug Jones, actually has a chance to win is a big deal. Alabama hasn't elected a Democrat to the Senate since 1992. KELLY: Now, I know this may be hard to answer, but how much of the fact that Jones seems to have a shot at this, how much of that has to do with the sexual harassment allegations against his opponent, Roy Moore? MARTIN: I think we can say that it is a big part of it. Jones has tried to capitalize on this. He's tried to make this election about Roy Moore's personal character. It is personal, though, on the other side, too, because Moore is tapping into the issue that rallies his base almost like nothing else. We're talking about abortion. His base is made up of white, conservative, evangelical Christians, like a woman I met named Shana Swan (ph). Here's Shana and her daughter, Anderson (ph), talking about how they see this vote. SHANA SWAN: Ask my third-grader who we're voting for. ANDERSON: Roy Moore because Doug Jones doesn't agree with the stuff we agree with. SWAN: Like, what's the main issue that we disagree with him about? ANDERSON: What is it, Mom? SWAN: You just learned about it this morning, unfortunately. ANDERSON: Something with an A. SWAN: It starts with an A. What does it mean? ANDERSON: That if somebody doesn't want their baby, the doctor can kill the baby before he's even born. SWAN: And how did you feel when you found out about that? ANDERSON: Sad. SWAN: Shocked. She couldn't believe that there is a law that you can kill your baby. And that was all we needed to know about him. He does not align with how we vote. KELLY: You know, I'm listening to that, Rachel, and thinking, among other things, we have heard so much about the personalities in this race, so much of the politics in this race. We've heard less about about the issues, things like abortion that are really important to voters in Alabama and their kids as we just heard. MARTIN: Right. And so this issue, abortion, is central to how conservative, white Christians are viewing this whole thing. We talked a lot about this with a man we met named Patrick Cooper. He's a pastor at the Oasis of Praise Church in Mcalla, Ala. This is a rural suburb outside Birmingham. A little side note here - as if this race weren't already loaded with a lot of bizarre political moments, the church is located on Pocahontas Road. KELLY: Oh, boy. MARTIN: Now, we talked with Patrick inside his church sanctuary, which was all decked out for Christmas. PATRICK COOPER: We're in the Bible Belt. Everybody's a Christian around here, whether they really are or not. I did not grow up in church. And I went - at 14, I was invited to church by a girl, of course, you know. MARTIN: (Laughter). COOPER: And I got saved in a little Baptist church just right down the road here, and I was 14. MARTIN: What do you remember about that? COOPER: I remember I, you know, had the hat real low 'cause I was trying to - I was just there for the girl, just being honest. But I felt something moving in my heart, you know? I felt something tugging me. The youth pastor's name was Jason. He said, hey, if you feel something, if you feel like you need to accept whatever this is I'm offering, you know, come down to the front. And I got out of my seat and I walked down there and he prayed for me, and I prayed, you know, that Jesus would be Lord of my life, that he would take control. And he did. Now, I was - I'm very opinionated, and I'm very hardheaded. And if you want to convince me of something, I need to see facts. I need to see - and so I'm even like that when it comes to the Bible. You know, if you want to tell me that, well, you know, the Bible says this, well, you know, show me. You know, don't just tell me. MARTIN: So how does that desire, that craving for information and truth and fact-based evidence, how has that informed how you have watched this election? COOPER: It has to an extent because there's no facts out there when it comes to these accusations. There's a lot of accusations. MARTIN: You're talking about the sexual harassment, sexual abuse allegations against Roy Moore. COOPER: Yeah. And some of the allegations are falling apart, you know, every hour it seems. But really - and I try to use my words properly, so I don't want this to seem like I am saying that sexual assault is OK by any means. I'm not. I'm a feminist, an old-school feminist. I'm not this new breed that thinks men should be less than women. I feel like that's where the movement's taken, but I believe in women's rights. And I think that women need to be respected. I think they need to be treated like queens. So I'm not for sexual assault. I want to lay that before I say what I'm going to say. But when I look at the two candidates that I feel - and I don't think you can vote third party in Alabama. I don't think it's an option. MARTIN: So you see this as a binary choice... COOPER: It has to be. It has to be. MARTIN: ...Doug Jones or Roy Moore, and you're supporting... COOPER: Roy Moore. And here's why. I have to make this choice off of what I do know, and what I do know is Doug Jones is in support of abortion. And that abortion issue is a big deal. MARTIN: Although he has said he would not touch Alabama's state laws. COOPER: You know, they say that, but he has a record of showing support of it. And I feel like - like, I know how things work. He's got a campaign manager that says, hey, we can gain some of these Republican vote, these conservative votes, these evangelical votes if you just kind of waver on this stance. And I have a strict biblical worldview. I believe life happens at the point of conception. And I think you either have to go all in with God, all in with what he says or don't. I don't think the middle of the ground helps anybody. MARTIN: And it's that issue that is - got your vote. COOPER: It is. MARTIN: So you wouldn't support Doug Jones because he supports what you view as sinful policies. COOPER: Well, it's not just sinful. Let me ask you this, OK? Take what we're discussing completely out of the picture. OK, I am going to present a case to you. Just based off what I say, give me your opinion. You have one guy who has been accused - accused - of sexual assault numerous times and then you have another guy that endorses the murder of millions of people. Which would you vote for? MARTIN: That's how you see it. COOPER: That's how I have to view it. And when put like that, I think every decent person - and I'm not saying everybody's got to believe like I do. This is not - like I said, I'm not trying to present something to you as an argument about abortion. I'm just saying this is the way most people see it down here and this is the way I see it. MARTIN: Sounds like you don't love your choices either way. COOPER: Oh, I hate it. I hate it. I'll cast my vote tomorrow, and I'll walk out there not feeling great. I'll feel a little dirty, the same way I did in November, just truthfully. We don't get the candidates that I think we deserve. And so Donald Trump... MARTIN: Did you have to make a compromise by voting for Donald Trump? COOPER: I did. I did. And like I said, I hate it. I hate it, but who else am I going to vote for? MARTIN: Can I ask you - is there a reality in which you could go to the polls and say to yourself, or to God, to pray and say I don't like my choices here. These are not men who represent my Christian values, and so I'm not going to vote? COOPER: My wife, she wanted to be here, but she couldn't be here. I think that's going to be her stance. I do. And I can't sit here and say you're wrong for not doing that because I can kind of see that. For me, a no vote for Roy Moore is a vote for Doug to me. And that's how I view it. Now, is that the only way to view it? No. Like I said, my wife - and she can make the decision she wants to and I can understand that decision. I do. I get when people say I'm just not going vote. MARTIN: Let me close with a big-picture question. When you think about your state - you've got kids? COOPER: Yes, I have a - yeah, I have a 5-year-old and a 7-month-old girl. MARTIN: Yeah. So what kind of Alabama you want for your kids? Is Roy Moore the person who can lead your state into the future? COOPER: No. But what option do I have? MARTIN: So, Mary Louise, you heard Patrick Cooper describe how he sees his choice in those very controversial terms when talking about abortion. Doug Jones would disagree with how Cooper describes his positions. Jones is a Democrat. He has said he supports a woman's right to choose. Clearly, this whole issue demonstrates how personal this election has become. KELLY: All right. That's our co-host, Rachel Martin, reporting all this morning from Alabama. She'll have a conversation later this morning with a supporter of Democrat Doug Jones. Copyright \u00a9 2017 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "President Trump points out a supporter of Roy Moore, the embattled Alabama Republican Senate candidate, as he speaks at a campaign-style rally in Pensacola, Fla., Friday.\n                \n                    \n                    Susan Walsh/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption President Trump points out a supporter of Roy Moore, the embattled Alabama Republican Senate candidate, as he speaks at a campaign-style rally in Pensacola, Fla., Friday. Once upon a time, there was a group of conservative intellectuals who were agnostic about Donald Trump. They were not \"Never Trumpers,\" but they weren't Trump superfans either. They thought Trumpism might offer something new for the GOP. Since Trump wasn't tied to the orthodoxies of either party he could, theoretically, offer a more populist path toward the future for Republicans. Conservative writer Henry Olsen, at the Ethics and Public Policy Center, looked to the tax plan to reflect this new vision, but it wasn't there. What gets [Trump supporters] riled up and active is the embrace of the culture-war issues \u2014 that Trump has shown himself perfectly happy to fight in a way that Republicans in a lot of other positions have been unwilling to traditionally. Ben Domenech, conservative writer For now, Olsen said, \"Trumpian populism remains a tantalizing promise for people who are interested in it.\" Olsen expected the tax plan to include some of Trump's populist campaign promises \u2014 that the rich would pay more, the forgotten working class would pay less, and special interest loopholes like the carried-interest provision for hedge-fund managers would be gone. But the tax bill ended up instead being traditionally Republican in its focus on cutting taxes for the well-to-do but barely touching the working class and not helping the middle class to a significant degree. \"That's not what Trump promised,\" Olsen said. \"And it's not what Trump's voters thought they were getting.\" Whatever happened to Ivanka Trump's child care tax credit? One of the biggest disappointments for conservatives who believed that Trump could have offered a new, more reform-minded populist economics was the failure of the expanded child care tax credit offered by Republican Sens. Mike Lee and Marco Rubio. It was an actual populist idea, geared to the working class, because it was refundable against payroll taxes. But not only did Republican leaders oppose it, they made sure it failed by requiring it to get 60 votes, unlike other amendments. Not populist, but very conservative The tax bill might not be the kind of populist piece of legislation Trump promised during the campaign, but it does have a lot in it to make conservatives happy. Obamacare is unraveled; there are more tax breaks for people who home-school their kids or send them to religious schools; and there are tax hikes for graduate students, university endowments and voters in high-tax states. In other words \u2014 Democrats. Maybe economic policy isn't the point of Trumpism at all Supporters wait for President Trump to speak during a rally at the Pensacola Bay Center Friday in Pensacola, Fla.\n                \n                    \n                    Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Supporters wait for President Trump to speak during a rally at the Pensacola Bay Center Friday in Pensacola, Fla. Maybe the most important thing Trump offers his supporters isn't economic policy or any policy at all \u2014 it's his racially charged Twitter feed and the cultural grievances it directs at immigrants, Muslims and millionaire black athletes. Sure, Trump's followers like the idea of having fewer tax brackets, said conservative Ben Domenech, publisher of TheFederalist.com, but, \"What gets them riled up and active is the embrace of the culture-war issues \u2014 that Trump has shown himself perfectly happy to fight in a way that Republicans in a lot of other positions have been unwilling to traditionally.\" There have always been two parts to the Republican Party's message: conservative social issues for its white, blue-collar, evangelical base (think school prayer, abortion, same-sex marriage, immigration and crime) and a supply-side, trickle-down economic message for the rich and corporations. Trump has taken this two-pronged approach and put it on steroids. His tax bill is much more tilted to the wealthy than the tax bills of Ronald Reagan or George W. Bush. And his white-identity politics is much more raw and more central to his persona. It's as if the Chamber of Commerce, Wall Street and the wealthy get the policy, while Trump's blue-collar base gets the Twitter feed. What happens to this tension over time? Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell smiles while talking to reporters. The GOP tax bill he's shepherding passed the Senate and is now being reconciled with the House.\n                \n                    \n                    Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell smiles while talking to reporters. The GOP tax bill he's shepherding passed the Senate and is now being reconciled with the House. In the long run, Olsen doesn't think this Trumpist combination of trickle-down economics and white-identity policies offers a viable path for the GOP. He's not even sure it's sustainable for Trump. And he disagrees that the basis of Trump's appeal was racial. \"There is a lingering discontent in the country that is much more than racial resentment,\" Olsen said. \"The working-class voters who voted for Obama and then for Trump were not motivated only by race.\" Olsen said voters generally give their presidential choice a long leash. But if the person doesn't deliver on what they really want in the end, voters will turn against him. And then, the culture wars on Twitter won't be enough. But in the short term, this tax bill just might be the kind of win Trump and his party need. To the extent it has any impact at all, in the first year or two, it will probably be a positive one for most people. Their taxes will go down, and they'll be able to keep more of their own money. That's because the tax bill is front-loaded; the goodies come first. The regressive, nonpopulist part of the bill, where taxes for the middle class actually go up \u2014 kicks in later, well after the next election cycle.",

For some Alabama voters, supporting abortion rights may be a sin worse than some of the sexual misdeeds Alabama GOP Senate nominee Roy Moore has been accused of \u2014 allegations Moore has denied. That's the conundrum facing the state's conservative, deeply religious electorate: Embrace Democrat Doug Jones despite his liberal stance on abortion and other social issues or vote for Moore anyway even if they believe there is some truth to the sexual assault allegations against him. \"The abortion issue alone is enough to buy [Moore] a win,\" predicted Brent Buchanan, an Alabama GOP pollster and consultant. \"That's the one nonnegotiable for social conservatives. You're not as hardcore on taxes. 'I can give up on that,' some voters might think. But when you're talking about somebody else's life, that's a whole different ballgame. And I think that's the big difference.\" Moore has underscored that major divide frequently at his campaign events, where he has continued to deny the accusations against him but also refused to answer questions from the media about the swirling scandal. Multiple women have accused the former Alabama Supreme Court chief justice of pursuing them romantically decades ago when they were teenagers and he was in his 30s, and one woman has said he initiated sexual contact with her when she was just 14. Moore's allies have also doubled down on the abortion issue in the race's final stretch. America First PAC, a pro-President Trump superPAC supporting Moore in the race, released an ad this week calling Jones' position on abortion \"unforgivable,\" showing an ultrasound and a heartbeat that then flatlines. .@AmericaFirstPAC launching this ad targeting Doug Jones on abortion in broadcast & cable markets in Birmingham & Huntsville over the next week\u2014> https://t.co/dIQMEJDFDo Moore spokeswoman Jane Porter was even less subtle when she appeared on CNN Tuesday, talking to pregnant anchor Poppy Harlow and congratulating her on her \"unborn child.\" \"[Moore will] stand for the rights of babies like yours in the womb, while his opponent will support killing them up until the moment of birth,\" Porter told a surprised Harlow. Porter later invoked Harlow's pregnancy again, to which the anchor responded, \"Let's leave my child out of this.\" Roy Moore Spokesperson Congratulates Host on Unborn Child Who She Says Moore's Opponent Wants to Kill. pic.twitter.com/galyFQWLs2 Jones may have unintentionally given Moore plenty of fodder on the abortion front in a September interview on MSNBC's MTP Daily with Chuck Todd. \"I'm not in favor of anything that is going to infringe on a woman's right and her freedom to choose,\" Jones said, when asked about a ban on abortion after 20 weeks. \"Once that baby is born, I'm going to be there for that child. That's where I become a right-to-lifer,\" he added. Later in an interview with AL.com Jones said he \"fully support[s] a woman's freedom to choose to what happens to her own body.\" He clarified that \"the law for decades has been that late-term procedures are generally restricted except in the case of medical necessity. That's what I support. I don't see any changes in that.\" But Moore has seized upon the initial comments to MSNBC, with his wife, Kayla, claiming that Jones supports \"full-term abortion.\" PolitiFact rated that claim as false, since there is no such thing as \"full-term abortion.\" But the damage may well have been done to Jones with the remarks to MSNBC, according to Buchanan, the GOP operative, who called it a \"pretty fatal mistake.\" And if Jones were anti-abortion rights, it might also be a very different contest, given the mounting problems for Moore. \"If [Jones] were pro-life, if he hadn't talked about it, he'd be ahead,\" Buchanan said. \"If Jones were pro-life, he'd be up 10 points.\" The delicate line Jones has had to walk on abortion is nothing new, especially for Southern Democrats. And it's an issue national Democrats have already wrestled with earlier this year, with groups that support abortion rights and more progressive activists upset that party leaders were willing to support candidates who oppose abortion. Democratic pollster Brad Chism's firm surveyed white women in Alabama and found that many were conflicted in their choice, with some wanting to vote for Jones but also still having major reservations about his support for abortion rights. \"Abortion is one of a handful of social issues where the mainline Democratic Party is significantly to the left of most white voters in the Deep South,\" Chism said. \"These voters in Alabama are very aware of the conflict they have for voting for an alleged child molester as opposed to voting for someone who would stymie the Trump agenda.\" Chism said that while abortion wasn't always the first issue many voters mentioned as giving them pause in voting for Jones, it was among the top concerns in voting for a Democrat. Alabama Democratic Senate nominee Doug Jones speaks as he hosts a \"Women's Wednesday\" campaign event this week.\n                \n                    \n                    Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Alabama Democratic Senate nominee Doug Jones speaks as he hosts a \"Women's Wednesday\" campaign event this week. \"Republicans have done a very good job of using that as a wedge issue to castigate a party that stands for much more than reproductive freedoms,\" Chism admitted. But Chism argued that while Jones was \"honest and forthright\" in his interview about abortion on MSNBC, it was \"subject to misinterpretation\" and that Republicans were taking his comments out of context. Steven Taylor, a political science professor at Alabama's Troy University, agreed that social issues may be a sticking point that many conservative voters aren't able to overcome in voting for Jones. In addition to abortion, Moore has hammered home his opposition to same-sex marriage and transgender rights. \"I think that, without a doubt, the social issues will motivate voters even if they are skeptical of the allegations against Moore,\" Taylor said. \"Quite clearly, abortion is probably the most salient issue in the race, and more generally, social issues.\" The fact that Moore is seen as a champion on social issues is nothing new. It's what propelled him to national political stardom \u2014 and into plenty of controversy. In 2003 he was first removed from the state bench when he had a statue of the Ten Commandments erected in the Alabama Judicial Building and refused to remove it even when ordered to do so by a federal court. He was elected again in 2012 but then subsequently suspended when he ordered state judges to defy the U.S. Supreme Court decision that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide under the federal Constitution. A sign is held up as people attend a campaign rally for Alabama Republican Senate nominee Roy Moore at Fairhope, Ala., earlier this week.\n                \n                    \n                    Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption A sign is held up as people attend a campaign rally for Alabama Republican Senate nominee Roy Moore at Fairhope, Ala., earlier this week. To Moore and his supporters, that defiance is a badge of honor. And it's a big reason many voters are likely reluctant to believe the sexual misconduct and sexual assault allegations against him too, given the Christian nationalist positions he has wholeheartedly embraced in the past. And at the crux of that is a stringent opposition to abortion. A 2014 Pew Research Center survey found that 58 percent of Alabamians believed abortion should be illegal in all or most cases, with just 37 percent supporting its legality. Another Pew study earlier this year found a wide chasm between the parties on the issue of abortion, with it being one of the most polarizing issues separating Republicans and Democrats. The dilemma for voters is not dissimilar from the one some Republicans faced in last year's presidential election. Even if they disliked Trump or thought that the sexual assault allegations that had been levied against him were true, for many the abortion issue and the possibility of appointing anti-abortion judges to the Supreme Court was a major deciding factor. And now, with the Senate nearly evenly split and the possibility of another Supreme Court appointment while Trump is in office, that may not be a chance Alabama voters who prioritize the abortion issue are willing to take, either. \"If you believe that abortion is murder and if you believe that the post-Roe v. Wade era is tantamount to new genocide, then you're willing to say, 'I'm going to ignore all these allegations and vote for Moore anyway' or it helps to rationalize away the allegations,\" said Taylor.",

He is campaigning on what he calls \"kitchen table\" issues, including health care, jobs and education.\n                \n                    \n                    Brynn Anderson/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption It has been a quarter of a century since reliably red Alabama elected a Democrat to the U.S. Senate. But Democrats see an opening in the upcoming special election to fill Attorney General Jeff Sessions' old seat because of the controversial record of Republican candidate Roy Moore, which includes twice being removed from public office. \"We're giving people a reason to believe,\" said Democratic candidate Doug Jones to hundreds of supporters at a fish fry in Mobile, Ala., underneath sprawling oak trees on the banks of Dog River. Pat Schwieterman told Jones that she is thrilled to have a viable Democrat on the ballot for a change. \"I feel so alone out here,\" she said of a state where Republicans hold every statewide office and last voted for a Democratic president when Jimmy Carter was on the ballot in 1976. Jones, a former federal prosecutor, is in high spirits because in the past week, a new Fox News poll shows the race tied. Most others have Moore up but by single digits \u2014 not the advantage you would expect in a state that President Trump won with 63 percent of the vote. The Dec. 12 special election could be \"transformational\" for the state, Jones said. \"I think we're going to win this race,\" said Jones in an interview with NPR. In a speech, Jones told the crowd he is aware that the odds are against him in this Republican-dominated state. \"It's not the first time that I heard that something I wanted to do, something I was passionate about, was a long shot,\" Jones says. \"When we prosecuted old Klansmen for the 1963 bombing of 16th Street Baptist Church, I was told, 'It's a long shot, Doug.' \" Jones, the former U.S. attorney in Birmingham, Ala., is best known for convicting the church bombers who killed four black girls, prosecuting the case decades after the civil rights era crime. He is the son of a Birmingham steelworker and is campaigning on what he calls \"kitchen table\" issues, including health care, jobs and education. Jones isn't emphasizing the social issues \u2014 like abortion, immigration and gun rights \u2014 that often drive Alabama elections. And he is portraying Moore as an extremist. Jones says he won't embarrass the state. \"People are tired of the dysfunction.\" Jones said. \"They don't want more chaos in Washington, D.C., which is what Roy Moore would be.\" Moore's campaign disputes that notion, pointing out that he has the backing of Alabama's entire Republican congressional delegation, and endorsements from Sens. Rand Paul, R-Ky., and Mike Lee, R-Utah. Moore's primary victory was the opening salvo in former White House strategist Steve Bannon's war on the GOP establishment. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Trump had backed Moore's primary opponent, appointed incumbent Sen. Luther Strange. Moore came out swinging during his speech at the recent Values Voter Summit in Washington, D.C., an annual gathering of Christian conservatives. Roy Moore, GOP Senate candidate and former chief justice on the Alabama Supreme Court, speaks during the annual Values Voter Summit earlier this month in Washington, D.C.\n                \n                    \n                    Mark Wilson/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Roy Moore, GOP Senate candidate and former chief justice on the Alabama Supreme Court, speaks during the annual Values Voter Summit earlier this month in Washington, D.C. \"It's not just a swamp, it's a quicksand,\" he said of Washington. \"We don't have leadership, we have followership. And we've got to get back to understand what our Founding Fathers did and what they stood for,\" Moore said. He also said the way to make America great again is to make it \"good again.\" \"We return the knowledge of God to our land and God will heal our land,\" said Moore to rousing applause. A darling of religious conservatives, Moore was removed as Alabama's chief justice twice for defying federal courts: once for refusing to take down a giant Ten Commandments monument from the state judicial building and, after being elected to the post a second time, for rejecting the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling that legalized same-sex marriage. He has said that homosexual conduct should be illegal and that Rep. Keith Ellison, D-Minn., who is Muslim, should not be allowed to serve in Congress because of his religion. Moore and a nonprofit founded by his family \u2014 the Foundation for Moral Law \u2014 have come under scrutiny for more than $1 million he earned from the charity, now run by his wife. A reporter recently asked Trump what made him comfortable with Moore serving in the Senate. The president deflected the question and said he was planning to talk with Moore this week. \"And we're going to talk to him about a lot of different things,\" Trump said. \"He ran a very strong race. The people of Alabama, who I like very much and they like me very much, but they like Roy.\" The question is whether the president will come to Alabama to campaign for Moore before the December general election. Back at the fish fry in Mobile, Schwieterman is asking similar questions about the Democratic National Committee. \"If nothing else, perhaps the DNC will realize that we're here,\" she says.",

Tim Murphy in 2014 on Capitol Hill. A report says texts show he asked a woman to get an abortion. Updated at 6 p.m. ET Republican Rep. Tim Murphy of Pennsylvania will resign from Congress after a report said he asked a woman with whom he had an extramarital affair to get an abortion. On Wednesday, Murphy had initially said he would simply not seek re-election in 2018. But the next day, House Speaker Paul Ryan announced that Murphy had sent his resignation letter, effective Oct. 21. \"It was Dr. Murphy's decision to move on to the next chapter of his life, and I support it,\" Ryan said in a statement. \"We thank him for his many years of tireless work on mental health issues here in Congress and his service to the country as a naval reserve officer.\" Murphy is a member of the House Pro-Life Caucus and has voted to impose more restrictions on abortion access. Earlier this week, Murphy voted in favor of the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, which \"would ban abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy,\" according to GovTrack. The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette said it obtained a record of a text message sent by Shannon Edwards, a forensic psychologist in Pittsburgh, to Murphy in January. \"And you have zero issue posting your pro-life stance all over the place when you had no issue asking me to abort our unborn child just last week when we thought that was one of the options,\" the newspaper quoted Edwards as writing about a Facebook post from Murphy's office. The Post-Gazette said a text from Murphy's cellphone number in response says, \"I get what you say about my March for life messages. I've never written them. Staff does them. I read them and winced. I told staff don't write any more. I will.\" In the end, it turned out Edwards was not pregnant. The affair came to light a month ago after a divorce proceeding involving Edwards and her husband was unsealed by a judge. Murphy admitted to the affair shortly after. \"Last year I became involved in an affair with a personal friend. This is nobody's fault but my own, and I offer no excuses,\" Murphy said in a statement through his attorney to the Post-Gazette. \"To the extent that there should be any blame in this matter, it falls solely upon me.\" Murphy has opposed using federal funding to cover abortions. He spoke at the Right to Life Convention in Pittsburgh in 2010, Katie Blackley of WESA reports for NPR, saying: \"Every kids deserves a chance to have a choice at life. Every child deserves a chance to have a choice at life. Every baby deserves a chance to have a choice at life. And every parent should be supported in their responsibility and commitment to raise that child.\" Murphy is in his eighth term in Congress representing the heavily Republican 18th District of Pennsylvania, in the southwest of the state. He is a practicing psychologist and has worked on legislation to overhaul mental health programs. The vacancy will now trigger a special election. But in a district which President Trump carried by 20 points in 2016, it won't be an easy target for Democrats. \"As I said last night, the circumstances surrounding this situation are extremely disappointing to me,\" National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Steve Stivers said in a statement Thursday. \"However, the NRCC is undefeated in special elections this year and I'm supremely confident that will continue. In the meantime, we look forward to seeing how national Democrats can spin yet another special election loss into a so-called 'moral victory.'\" Democrats, however, said they would be watching the race regardless. \"While the circumstances surrounding Representative Murphy's resignation are uniquely disturbing and hypocritical, he will certainly not be the last House Republican to have an involuntary and embarrassing end to their career this election cycle,\" said Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee spokeswoman Meredith Kelly. \"Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District is a reliable Republican stronghold, but the grassroots energy behind Democrats has proven powerful this year, and we will be closely tracking this district and special election.\"",

North Carolina's Republican-led General Assembly has approved a set of legislative district maps to replace the 2011 plans thrown out by the courts for being illegal racial gerrymanders. The problem, many critics say, is that the new maps are just as bad. The state's battles over political geography come less than six weeks before the U.S. Supreme Court is set to hear arguments in a case about the extent to which partisanship can be used to draw legislative and congressional districts. The current round of redistricting was set off in June, after the Supreme Court affirmed a lower court's ruling that Republican lawmakers had relied too heavily on race to draw district lines in 2011. The court found that 28 districts \u2014 19 in the state House and nine in the Senate \u2014 were drawn in a way that diluted the power of black voters. The state legislature is now under a court order to submit new maps to a panel of three federal judges by Friday. The judges will decide whether the proposed replacement maps pass constitutional muster; if not, the judges can take over the redrawing of districts themselves. During public hearings held last week, hundreds of people swarmed multiple sites across the state to offer criticism of the plans, arguing they are designed to rig elections in favor of the Republican majority. Among them was Mitchell Cook, a 23-year-old resident of Raleigh who described himself as a politically unaffiliated voter. Before the hearing got underway, Cook said districts should be drawn by an independent, nonpartisan commission, \"so that the districts are truly representative of the voice and the views of the people.\" Republican state Sen. Ralph Hise, who chairs the state Senate's redistricting committee, said he neither believed in unicorns nor the \"mythical\" nonpartisan redistricting commission. 'No. 1' in gerrymandering The stakes are high for Republicans, who hold veto-proof majorities in the legislature, giving them a significant political advantage over the Democratic governor, Roy Cooper. To hold those supermajorities, Republicans must win a minimum of 72 seats in the 120-seat House and at least 30 of the 50 Senate seats. The GOP currently holds 74 seats in the House and 35 in the Senate. As they stand, the new maps easily could give Republicans what they want, according to the past election data that the mapmakers used to redraw the districts. This time around, Republican legislators avoided using race while drawing the new districts, instead using criteria such as municipal boundaries, incumbency protection and past election results. House Minority Leader Darren Jackson said he did not think Republicans racially gerrymandered districts in 2011 because they were racists but accused GOP lawmakers of being determined to preserve their political control at any price. \"I know that partisan gerrymandering has not been struck down by the courts yet, plans like the one before us today are putting us on that path,\" Jackson warned. \"There are bad Democratic gerrymanders in states like Maryland and bad Republican ones in states like Wisconsin, but we remain the top dog in gerrymandering. Nobody does it like North Carolina, we're No. 1.\" To Republicans, such as Senate President Pro Tem Phil Berger, the issue is that Democrats have stopped being a competitive political force outside of urban areas. He argued that a failing message, not gerrymandering, is at the heart of Democrats' problems. \"When I first ran for the state Senate, many of the Democrats in this chamber, and many of the Democrats running, shared the cultural values of North Carolina's moderate to conservative voters. They were pro-education, but many were also pro-business, pro-gun, and pro-life,\" Berger said. Now, Berger argued, Democrats in North Carolina are aligned with what he called powerful, national special interests such as labor unions, environmental advocacy groups and the pro-choice lobby. \"It's easy to understand why gerrymandering has been the boogeyman since they were swept out of power in 2010. It's easier to blame the maps, blame a process, blame anything, really, than it is to take responsibility for losing touch with the politics of voters in 75 of North Carolina's 100 counties.\"",

            "article_content": "In Alabama, voters head to the polls Tuesday in a primary for U.S. Senate. The race is to fill a seat long occupied by Attorney General Jeff Sessions.  STACEY VANEK SMITH, HOST: We're going to talk more about Charlottesville later in the program, but we want to spend some time now looking at a few stories that will be in the news next week. Let's start in Alabama for our weekly segment Worlds You'll Hear. There's a special Senate election there to fill the seat long held by Jeff Sessions, now attorney general. And in the Republican primary, the emerging theme is drain the swamp. NPR's Debbie Elliott has been watching the race and joins us now from her home in south Alabama. Hi, Debbie. DEBBIE ELLIOTT, BYLINE: Hi, Stacey. SMITH: So, Debbie, words we'll hear - drain the swamp. We'll get back to that in a moment. But first, why don't you give us the lay of the land? Who's running? ELLIOTT: Well, let's start with the Republican primary. There's a really packed field, but three contenders are kind of standing out at the top. There's the incumbent Luther Strange, there is Congressman Mo Brooks and there's former Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore. Now, let me tell you a little bit about each of them. Roy Moore is known as the Ten Commandments judge because, at one point, he put this giant Ten Commandments monument in the state judicial building. SMITH: Oh, wow. ELLIOTT: He's twice been removed from the bench for defying federal courts - once because he refused to take down that monument and once when he defied the U.S. Supreme Court same-sex marriage ruling. Now, he has very strong support among religious conservatives in Alabama, and he's really got a lot of name recognition, too. Luther Strange, who's in the Senate seat now - he's a former attorney general in Alabama. They call him Big Luther because he's 6'9. He was appointed to fill Sessions' seat by a former governor who was embroiled in scandal at the time, so he's had to answer some questions about that. And then there's Congressman Mo Brooks. He's from North Alabama. He's a member of the House Freedom Caucus. And he's drawn a little controversy for saying that Democrats are waging a war on white people. SMITH: How is President Trump figuring into the race? ELLIOTT: You know, he's front and center. He's very popular in Alabama, and every one of the candidates are trying to sort of show that they're the ones who's going to have his back. For his part, Trump actually stepped in the race last week. He endorsed Strange in the form of a tweet. I want to play this little bit of an ad for you because, immediately, Luther Strange campaign was on the airwaves, quoting the president's tweet. (SOUNDBITE OF POLITICAL AD) UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: He has my complete and total endorsement. LUTHER STRANGE: Others attack our president. I'm fighting with him to drain the swamp. ELLIOTT: There you heard it, Drain the swamp, this idea that Trump and Strange are going to shake things up in Washington. But the irony there is that the GOP establishment is very much behind Luther Strange. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's Senate Leadership Fund is spending millions to get Strange elected, and so is the pro-Trump America First super PAC. SMITH: What are the big issues in this race? ELLIOTT: All the candidates are pretty much the same. It's very hard to distinguish them. Everybody lines up on restricting abortion, preserving gun rights, repealing Obamacare - those very conservative issues here in Alabama. So everybody has been focusing on this establishment versus the outsider. And in that narrative, Mitch McConnell has become the villain. Like, there are little cutouts of his head shaking on the TV commercials. Here, let's listen to this latest ad from Judge Roy Moore. (SOUNDBITE OF POLITICAL AD) UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: Moore's his man. Moore fears God, stands for the Constitution, fights for what is right and believes what we believe. Drain the swamp. Send McConnell a message. SMITH: Drain the swamp. There it is again (laughter). ELLIOTT: All the candidates are using that, even the lesser-known ones. Congressman Mo Brooks, this past week, has been on a drain-the-swamp tour. Now, nobody is likely to get a majority of the vote in this primary on Tuesday, so the GOP race will probably head to a runoff, and then whoever wins the runoff would face a Democratic nominee in December. And just on that side, coming up Tuesday, the lead contender there is former U.S. attorney Doug Jones of Birmingham, and he has picked up an endorsement from the former vice president, Joe Biden.

            "article_content": "Loading... When West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice stood next to President Trump during a campaign rally in Huntington, W.Va., on Thursday to announce that he was switching parties and becoming a Republican, it was a historic moment for the GOP. Justice's decision gives Republicans control of 34 governorships \u2014 tying a record set nearly a century ago. Democrats hold just 15 governorships. (Alaska's governor is an independent). Republicans now hold so-called trifectas \u2014 control of a governor's mansion and both chambers of a state legislature \u2014 in 26 states (including Nebraska's non-partisan unicameral legislature which is effectively controlled by Republicans). Democrats have just six such trifectas. That's in addition to Republicans' complete control of the federal government. And unlike their D.C. cousins, Republicans in statehouses across the country can point to conservative policy accomplishments this year, such as adding new restrictions on abortion, expanding gun rights, weakening private and public sector labor unions and expanding school voucher programs. But a constellation of forces means that this level of Republican dominance in the states is brittle and in danger of shattering. Large playing field, unpopular president Perhaps the biggest reason Republicans are vulnerable is because of the extent of their past successes at the state level. Republicans are defending 27 of the 38 governors' seats that are up election between now and November 2018. And 14 of those 27 seats will be vacant \u2014 including large, important states such as Florida, Michigan and Ohio \u2014 mostly due to term limits. While it's too early to tell how many races will be truly competitive, it's likely Republicans will face plenty of headwinds. State-level elections have become increasingly nationalized over the past two decades and the president's popularity can have a major impact on voter enthusiasm and turnout \u2014 especially a challenge with a president as polarizing and unpopular as President Trump currently is. Infighting and overreach Years in power have also created problems for state-level Republicans. In Kansas, an overly ambitious plan to cut taxes orchestrated by Gov. Sam Brownback (who's been nominated to a State Department post in the Trump administration) starved the state of funds for its schools and other services. Kansas Republicans wound up bitterly divided over the issue and earlier this year, a moderate faction sided with Democrats to override Brownback's veto and rescind the tax cuts. Similarly, a series of tax cuts in oil-dependent Oklahoma left the state poorly prepared for a downturn in energy prices. Republican lawmakers were forced to swallow their opposition and vote for tax hikes in order to keep the state solvent. With Democrats all but vanquished in several Republican-dominated states, intra-Republican disputes have taken center stage. In Texas, Republicans are divided between a business-friendly faction that prioritizes low taxes and less regulation and social conservatives eager to pass the most conservative legislation possible, such as a bill limiting transgender access to bathrooms. Earlier this year, Florida Gov. Rick Scott was running campaign-style ads against fellow Republicans in the legislature over a dispute about economic development funds. A combination of voters unhappy with the governing party's track record and internal party rifts that will play out in primary elections, sometimes leading to extreme or unqualified candidates, could weigh down Republican candidates up and down the ballot over the next year. West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice announces that he is switching parties to become a Republican as President Trump listens on at a campaign rally Thursday in Huntington, W.Va.\n                \n                    \n                    Justin Merriman/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice announces that he is switching parties to become a Republican as President Trump listens on at a campaign rally Thursday in Huntington, W.Va. The maps and the courts After the Republican wave election in 2010, victorious GOP state lawmakers took advantage of that year's decennial redistricting to further entrench their power, especially in swing states such as Wisconsin and North Carolina. Republican-drawn legislative and congressional district maps in North Carolina, Texas, Virginia, Georgia and Alabama are already in federal court because of concerns about racial gerrymandering and North Carolina has already been ordered to redraw some of its districts. But an even greater existential threat to Republican dominance at the state level comes from one of the most important Supreme Court cases of this fall's docket. Arguments in Gill vs. Whitford could determine whether Republican lawmakers in Wisconsin were allowed to take partisanship into account when drawing legislative boundaries. The Republican maps in Wisconsin were so formidably drawn that the GOP won 60 of 99 seats in the Wisconsin House even as Democrats drew more votes statewide in 2012 and 2014. While both parties use partisan gerrymandering to their advantage, Republicans' dominance at the state level means the GOP has far more on the line from a Supreme Court decision. Can Democrats capitalize? The flip side of Republicans' dominance is the weakness of state-level Democrats. Going into the 2010 midterm elections, Democrats had full control of 17 states compared to Republicans' 10 states. Democrats acknowledge they've let their state parties wither and need to focus on rebuilding. As former President Barack Obama told NPR's Steve Inskeep after the 2016 election, \"you've got a situation where there are not only entire states but also big chunks of states where, if we're not showing up, if we're not in there making an argument, then we're going to lose.\" But Democrats have a long way to go. A much touted effort to recruit candidates for this year's Virginia's House of Delegates elections has substantially increased the number of districts Democrats are competing in from 39 in 2015 to 67 today \u2014 but that still leaves 33 districts where the party was unable to find a candidate to run. Still, while Democrats haven't won any of the special U.S. House elections so far this year, they've significantly improved their margins even in deeply Republican districts \u2014 suggesting that Democratic voters are highly motivated. More evidence of enthusiasm comes from the latest Quinnipiac poll that has 52 percent of voters saying they prefer that Democrats control Congress compared to 38 percent for Republicans. Given the GOP edge in congressional and state legislative districts, Democrats will probably need popular sentiment to sway far in their favor if they are to have a hope of regaining power. It's still 15 months until Election Day 2018 and plenty can still happen. But based on the landscape, it's hard to see how Republicans can maintain their current level of dominance.",

For decades, Chile has boasted one of the world's strictest abortion bans. Passed in the final years of dictator Augusto Pinochet's reign, the rule has for nearly three decades outlawed the procedure without exception, placing Chile among just a few countries worldwide to do so. Lawmakers voted to relax that law Wednesday, allowing abortions in three cases: when the pregnancy resulted from rape, when the mother's life is in danger and when the fetus is unviable. President Michelle Bachelet, who has long fought to roll back the country's abortion ban, says she will sign the measure into law. \"Today women recover a basic right that we never should have lost: to decide when we go through moments of pain,\" Bachelet tweeted Wednesday. Hoy las mujeres recuperamos un derecho b\u00e1sico que nunca debimos perder: decidir cuando vivimos momentos de dolor. #YoApoyo3Causales Still, the fight is not over. That's because it still requires approval from Chile's Constitutional Court, which resolves disputes on whether a law complies with the country's constitution. The conservative opposition already requested a ruling from the tribunal, alleging in a 67-page document that the bill violates the constitutional mandate to \"protect the life that is about to be born,\" according to Telesur TV. The legislation \u2014 in its several different iterations \u2014 has been the subject of years of bitter debate, and it was only a last-minute change to the bill that enabled it to cobble together enough votes to pass the Senate. Now, the bill's fate in could depend on how long the court takes to render its decision. The head of the tribunal, a center-left Bachelet appointee considered supportive of the bill, is expected to be the swing vote in the ruling \u2014 but he will be stepping down when his mandate ends August 29. At that point, he will be replaced by conservative judge Ivan Arostica, who is thought to be firmly anti-abortion. For now, though, advocates have expressed hope for the measure, which Bloomberg reports more than 70 percent of Chileans support. \"This is historic, a great triumph that will allow Chilean women to feel safe,\" said Claudia Dides, director of advocacy group Miles Chile, told the outlet. \"We think that the Constitutional Court will solve this quickly because no one wants to see it becoming tangled in the political agenda for the next presidential election.\"",

A fundraising effort initiated by a Dutch government minister has raised $300 million for affected organizations. An effort to help global sexual health charities losing support under the Trump administration has reached a new milestone: $300 million in fundraising. The Dutch government revealed the new figure on Friday. The \"She Decides\" initiative \u2014 the brainchild of one Dutch official \u2014 kicked off earlier this year, and announced $190 million in funding as of early March. Thanks to \"ongoing enthusiasm,\" donations from nations, organizations and individuals have since continued to flow in. Norway, Sweden, Finland and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (which also supports NPR) have all pledged new funding, the Dutch statement says, while Rwanda, Chad, South Africa, South Korea, Senegal, Nigeria and Mozambique have signed on as \"friends\" of the initiative. \"It's fantastic to see how the funding gap is shrinking month by month,\" Lilianne Ploumen, the foreign trade and development cooperation minister who is running the initiative, said in the statement. The fundraising effort began after President Trump reinstated the \"Mexico City policy.\" That's a rule that says U.S. foreign aid cannot be sent to any organization that provides or \"promotes\" abortion, which can include providing information about abortion. Generally, Republican administrations impose the Mexico City policy and Democratic ones don't. But Trump went further than past presidents. Previous versions of the Mexico City policy applied to reproductive health funding \u2014 about $600 million a year. But the new policy covers all global health funding, more than $8 billion annually. As NPR's Nurith Aizenman reported in January, \"It remains to be seen how much of that goes to groups that currently provide or promote abortion as defined by the policy \u2014 and that would opt to give up U.S. aid dollars rather than falling in line.\" In March, Nurith wrote about the origin of the She Decides program. Ploumen, the minister who launched it, told Nurith she was disappointed by Trump's decision to reinstate the policy \u2014 then realized she was \"in a position to do something\": \"As a self-identified Catholic \u2014 'I do go to church, though not every week,' Ploumen says \u2014 she might seem an unusual champion of this cause. Several Catholic organizations are among the staunchest supporters of the U.S. funding ban, arguing that it's the only way to ensure that U.S. tax dollars don't go toward supporting abortions overseas. \" 'Without the Mexico City Policy in place, the U.S. is ... exporting the destruction of life as a solution to challenges faced by families in developing countries,' Deirdre McQuade, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops told NPR shortly after Trump's election. 'Poor women in developing nations don't want help aborting their children. They're calling for food, clean water, housing, education and medicine for their families.' \"Ploumen counters that her Catholic faith is actually what drives her commitment to the effort. \" 'We were taught that your faith helps you to develop your own conscience and to make your own decisions,' she says. 'But in order to be able to do so you have information and you have to know what your options are, so that you can weigh them according to your values.' \" \"And like other opponents of the funding ban, Ploumen argues it will prove counterproductive by resulting in more unwanted pregnancies and unsafe abortions.\"",

Ralph Northam for governor during a canvass kickoff on Saturday in Arlington, Va.\n                \n                    \n                    Don Gonyea/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Virginia Sens. Mark Warner and Tim Kaine campaign for Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam for governor during a canvass kickoff on Saturday in Arlington, Va. As Virginia voters go to the polls Tuesday to pick their nominees for governor, President Trump has cast a shadow over both parties' primaries in very different ways. In the much closer Democratic contest, both Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam and former U.S. Rep. Tom Perriello have tried to use anger against the president to motivate their voters in an off-year primary. On the airwaves, Northam has branded the president a \"narcissistic maniac,\" while one of Perriello's closing spots has talked about fighting \"tyranny\" at home. On the Republican side, former Republican National Committee Chairman Ed Gillespie is the heavy favorite in a three-way contest, but he has faced a fight from the far right in staunch Trump ally Corey Stewart. The general election will be a closely watched affair as the first statewide competitive contest of the Trump era in a state that has been consistently trending blue. Bernie vs. Hillary redux? Whoever wins the Democratic nomination on Tuesday could say a lot about the direction of the party. Former U.S. Rep. Tom Perriello listens to a question during a town hall in Richmond, Va., last month.\n                \n                    \n                    Steve Helber/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Former U.S. Rep. Tom Perriello listens to a question during a town hall in Richmond, Va., last month. Initially, Northam looked like he would sail through the primary as the heir apparent to Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe. (Virginia is the only state that limits its chief executive to one term.) But then Perriello, a one-term congressman who was swept in with President Barack Obama in 2008 and then promptly swept out two years later in the GOP wave, announced in January he was launching a surprise gubernatorial bid. The now razor-thin race has shades of the 2016 primary contest between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders. Perriello is touting his progressive credentials and has the support of the Vermont senator as well as Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. Meanwhile, Northam has the state's Democratic establishment in his corner \u2014 McAuliffe and Sens. Mark Warner and Tim Kaine, the latter Clinton's running mate last year. To Joshua Butler, 32, who came to a Perriello town hall in Leesburg last week, the candidate's progressive credentials and big-name endorsers were critical. \"Anyone that both Sen. Warren and Bernie support, I'm all for,\" Butler said. \"I believe that they are the change and the force that Democrats need moving forward, and anyone they support I believe is the right choice for the party.\" But that isn't enough for everyone. John Clisham, 53, came out to a Northam canvass kickoff on Saturday morning clad in a Bernie shirt. And even though the man he once supported in the presidential race is endorsing Perriello, he said he is still lining up behind Northam, citing his experience as lieutenant governor, his military service and his career as a pediatric neurologist. \"The party does seem to have two very distinct groups right now vying for people's respect and ideas,\" Clisham said. \"I have a lot of respect for Bernie Sanders and I love his politics. But I think in this race, for the state of Virginia, Ralph Northam is the better candidate.\" A difference of style more than substance While Perriello may have embraced the party's progressive, populist mantle more than Northam, there are few gaps between the two when it comes to policy. But their style and approach to the campaign are distinct. The frenetic Perriello, 42, held a 24-hour marathon campaign blitz throughout the commonwealth at the end of last week, stopping in diners and gas stations and holding a fun run. The 57-year-old Northam has stuck to the more traditional way of campaigning, emphasizing the deep support he enjoys from every statewide Democratic official and state legislator. He has heavily outspent Perriello on air in the closing stretch. Perriello's campaign ads don't just feature Sanders and Warren but also a clip of former President Obama campaigning for him in 2010. Obama has remained neutral in the race, but many of his former aides have lined up behind Perriello. Perriello once ran the Center for American Progress Action Fund and later went on to serve in Obama's State Department. He also has the endorsement of Clinton's campaign chairman John Podesta, who worked with Perriello at CAP. The former congressman from Charlottesville made his anti-Trump message a priority early on, and he told NPR that was a big reason why he decided to get in the contest. \"Leadership, in my mind, begins not when you take office, but with how you run your race. And we were very clear in stepping into this race that we were going to be that brick wall against Trump's policies,\" Perriello said in an interview. Republican gubernatorial candidates Ed Gillespie (right) and Corey Stewart (left) during a debate at Liberty University in Lynchburg, Va., in April.\n                \n                    \n                    Steve Helber/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Republican gubernatorial candidates Ed Gillespie (right) and Corey Stewart (left) during a debate at Liberty University in Lynchburg, Va., in April. \"We didn't see that from others who were in the race at the time or since. What we've seen is both identifying it ahead of time, being willing to step into that breach,\" Perriello said, claiming early resistance to Trump's proposed travel ban. Northam hasn't minced words about Trump either, and in his most memorable television spot, after touting his support for gun control and how he fought a GOP push in the state Legislature to require transvaginal ultrasounds before abortions, the physician bluntly calls the president of the United States a \"narcissistic maniac.\" \"He's a dangerous man. I don't like the direction that he's taking this country,\" Northam later told NPR. \"And so I think it's fair to refer to him as a narcissist, because that's what he is.\" But while fierce criticism of the president has been a hallmark of his campaign, the lieutenant governor underscores he is stressing his experience in Richmond, arguing that has best prepared him for the job. \"I think if someone looks at my history of public service in Virginia, they will see that I have been unwavering in support of progressive Democratic values,\" Northam argued. Party officials, and many Democratic voters, say that whoever wins, the emphasis should be on defeating the GOP nominee this November, with the goal of delivering a shock to the White House. \"I'm so hopeful that this state of Virginia shows up and sends a big message for all Americans\" against Trump, said Barbara Jones, 58, an independent undecided voter. She said she was leaning toward voting for Northam in the Democratic primary but liked what she heard from Perriello at his town hall last week in Leesburg. Gillespie's challenge this fall Trying to convince voters like Jones that this race isn't about Trump will be Gillespie's biggest challenge \u2014 if he wins the primary on Tuesday night. The president certainly won't be a plus for whomever the GOP nominates this fall. Trump's approval among Virginians was at just 36 percent in an April Quinnipiac University Poll, and last November he lost the state by 6 points. But a primary challenge from the right has forced Gillespie into some uncomfortable territory as he would much rather look ahead to the general election. Stewart, the head of the Prince William County Board of Supervisors, was a former Virginia co-chairman for Trump. And capitalizing on the recent trend where insider status isn't a desirable label in GOP primaries, Stewart has tried to turn Gillespie's stellar resume \u2014 former RNC chairman, former adviser to President George W. Bush, near-successful 2014 Senate nominee \u2014 against him. \"This is a guy who ... doesn't want to change anything; he's the establishment,\" Stewart said at a Virginia Beach campaign event earlier this year. As NPR's Sarah McCammon reported, Stewart has seized on a controversial and polarizing strategy to motivate his voters to go to the polls: \"Stewart, a former Trump campaign chairman, also draws frequently from Trump's repertoire: giving opponents catchy nicknames ('Establishment Ed' for Gillespie) and promising to 'crack down' on illegal immigration and 'take back Virginia.' The Minnesota native also is running on a theme of preserving Southern heritage, making multiple statements opposing the removal of Confederate monuments. And he is explicitly appealing to Trump supporters.\" There's been limited public polling of the race, but most predict Gillespie will easily dispatch Stewart and a third candidate, state Sen. Frank Wagner. Still, Stewart's constant invocation of Trump and reliance on identity politics and nationalist ideas have forced Gillespie to walk a fine line. Ultimately, he hasn't fully embraced or rebuked the president. \"As I travel Virginia, Virginians are very focused on Virginia,\" he told NBC News in an interview last month. \"And I'm very focused on Virginia.\" Pressed by NBC as to whether he would campaign with Trump, Gillespie also hedged and argued this was about state and local issues. \"Look, a lot of Virginians voted for President Trump. And a lot did not,\" Gillespie said. \"This election's about Virginia and the future of the commonwealth we love.\" But unfortunately for Gillespie, the commonwealth is in the shadow of Washington, D.C., and the contest for Virginia governor is going to be the nation's biggest race come November. It may give Democrats a sense of whether an anti-Trump message can work in 2018 \u2014 and whether Republicans will be forced to define their relationship with the president.",

Georgia's 6th Congressional District in the suburbs north of Atlanta was once held by former Speaker Newt Gingrich. Its most recent occupant, HHS Secretary Tom Price, resigned to join President Trump's Cabinet. Both Republicans and Democrats see the June 20 special election to replace Price as a possible bellwether of what's to come in 2018. And they are spending. Nearly $30 million has been raised by the candidates and outside groups in a race that now comes down to two finalists: 30-year-old Democrat Jon Ossoff and Republican Karen Handel, 55. Last night they held their first debate. And all that money led to some tough sparring. Handel, a businesswoman who once served as Georgia's secretary of state, said Ossoff's support comes from places utterly unlike Georgia. \"My opponent has more donors and more dollars coming from outside of the state of Georgia,\" Handel said. \"They are coming from [House Minority Leader] Nancy Pelosi, California, New York, Massachusetts. He doesn't want the people of Georgia to know that he is a liberal Democrat.\" In fact Ossoff, a documentary filmmaker and former congressional aide, has raised more than $8 million, most of it online, much of it from Democrats anxious to send a message to President Trump. \"The average contribution to my campaign is less than $50,\" Ossoff said. \"And in stark contrast Secretary Handel, like so many career politicians in both parties who are mired in gridlock in Washington, has had her campaign bailed out by anonymous Washington super PACs who are spending unprecedented amounts on attack ads here.\" Echoing some of his TV ads, Ossoff repeatedly raised Handel's tenure as an official with the Susan G. Komen organization, the largest fundraiser for breast cancer research. Ossoff claimed Handel played a central role in its 2012 decision to cut off funding to Planned Parenthood for breast cancer screening. The move was widely perceived as a bow to anti-abortion rights groups. The subsequent uproar led Komen to reverse itself three days later, but contributions to the organization fell by more than 20 percent. Handel resigned soon after. But Handel downplayed her role. \"I was one of hundreds of employees at the Komen foundation,\" Handel said. \"Secondly, I was tasked by the CEO and chairman of the board to develop options for how the organization could disengage from Planned Parenthood. Why? Because the grants were not effective.\" The first round of this congressional race took place in April, when Ossoff fell just short of receiving more than 50 percent of the vote, forcing this month's run-off. Handel finished a distant second to Ossoff, but the Republican vote was split among many candidates. There is another debate scheduled this week, and more dollars are coming into the campaign, from Republicans eager to hold on to a seat they've held for decades and Democrats who see a chance not only to send a message to Trump but to lay the groundwork for a hoped-for takeover of the House in 2018.",

She went on to graduate from college while caring for sons Skylar and Ivory.\n                \n                    \n                    Courtesy of Jessica Chester\n                    \n                \nhide caption Jessica Chester was a top student in high school when she became pregnant at age 17. She went on to graduate from college while caring for sons Skylar and Ivory. To understand why teen pregnancy rates are so high in Texas, meet Jessica Chester. When Chester was in high school in Garland, she decided to attend the University of Texas at Dallas. She wanted to become a doctor. \"I was top of the class,\" she says. \"I had a GPA of 4.5, a full-tuition scholarship to UTD. I was not the stereotypical girl someone would look at and say, 'Oh, she's going to get pregnant and drop out of school.' \" But right before her senior year of high school, Chester, then 17, missed her period. She bought a pregnancy test and told her mom to wait outside the bathroom door. \"I saw both lines came up,\" Chester says. \"I had tears and I remember just opening the door and she was standing there with her arms out and she just wrapped me up and hugged me. I just cried and she told me it's going to be OK.\" Chester's mother had also been a teen mom, and so had her grandmother. In Texas every year, about 35,000 teens and young women get pregnant before they turn 20. And while rates of teen pregnancy are on the decline nationwide, in Texas the rate of decline is slower. Traditionally, the two variables most commonly associated with high teen birth rates are education and poverty, but a new study co-authored by Dr. Julie DeCesare, of the University of Florida's OB-GYN residency program in Pensacola, shows that there's more at play. \"We controlled for poverty as a variable, and we found these 10 centers where their teen birth rates were much higher than would be predicted,\" she says. DeCesare, whose research appears in the June issue of the journal Obstetrics & Gynecology, says several of those clusters were in Texas. The Dallas and San Antonio areas, for example, had teen pregnancy rates 50 percent and 40 percent above the national average. Research shows teens everywhere are having sex, with about half of high school students saying they've had sexual intercourse. Gwen Daverth, CEO of the Texas Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy, says the high numbers in Texas reflect policy, not promiscuity. \"What we see is there are not supports in place,\" Daverth says. \"We're not connecting high-risk youth with contraception services. And we're not supporting youth in making decisions to be abstinent.\" The state needs to emulate more progressive policies found in other states, she says. Chester with her then-boyfriend Marcus Chester and sons Ivory and Skylar. They have since married.\n                \n                    \n                    Courtesy of Jessica Chester\n                    \n                \nhide caption Chester with her then-boyfriend Marcus Chester and sons Ivory and Skylar. They have since married. For years, California has invested in comprehensive sex education and access to contraception, Daverth says. There, the teenage birth rate dropped by 74 percent from 1991 to 2012. The teen birth rate in Texas also fell, but only by 56 percent. In South Carolina, young women on Medicaid who have babies are offered the opportunity to get a long-acting form of birth control right after they give birth. They're also trying that approach in parts of North Carolina. And Colorado subsidizes the cost of long-acting birth control. There, both abortions and teen birth rates are dropping faster than the national average. Texas makes it hard for teenagers to get reproductive health care, Daverth says. In Texas, if a 17-year-old mom wants prescription birth control, in most cases she needs her parents' permission. \"Only us and Utah have a law that if you're already a parent, you are the legal medical guardian of your baby but you cannot make your own medical decisions without the now-grandma involved,\" Daverth says. That's part of the reason, she notes, that Texas has the highest rate of repeat teen pregnancies in the country. After Skylar was born, Chester wasn't given contraception counseling and still wasn't sure where to go for help. Three months later she was pregnant again. She and her then-boyfriend, now-husband hadn't realized she could get pregnant so soon after having a baby. She was a full-time student at UT-Dallas at that point, double-majoring in molecular biology and business administration. But the education Chester never got, she says, was sex ed. \"In hindsight,\" she says, \"It's like, 'Dude, what were you all thinking? I came in 17, pregnant, why weren't you all lining up the chart and showing me [my] options?' \" Chester's high school taught abstinence-only sex ed, and the majority of schools in Texas, either do that or don't offer any sex education at all. But more districts do seem to be adopting \"abstinence plus\" \u2014 which still encourages abstinence but also includes information on other pregnancy prevention methods and sexually transmitted diseases. Still, abstinence-only education is king, and of course, some parents aren't comfortable discussing sex with teens, much like Chester's mother wasn't. Nicole Hudgens, a policy analyst with the socially conservative Texas Values public policy group, supports abstinence-only education and says there are plenty of options for young moms who become pregnant. \"There are so many places like crisis pregnancy centers that are able to help these girls that are in need,\" Hudgens says. Crisis pregnancy centers provide counseling and support for pregnant teens but don't offer abortions or contraception. Studies show access to contraception is key to reducing the teen pregnancy rate. And according to the National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy, teen pregnancies in Texas cost the state $1.1 billion each year. Gwen Daverth says the costs are due to lost wages and an increased reliance on social services. \"One of the things we know is that 60 percent of teen parents will not graduate from high school and only 2 percent will go on to graduate from college,\" Daverth says. Jessica Chester did graduate from college. Her mom helped her through it, and she did end up taking out loans for day care, but she got a degree and at age 30 now has a job doing community outreach and family planning. \"I have a lot of support with my mother alone,\" Chester says. \"I had the example in front of me of [that getting pregnant young] doesn't have to derail your plans, it doesn't have to stop you from getting an education and a career.\" Chester with Ivory (left), 11, Skylar (right), 12, and Kameron (center), 21 months.\n                \n                    \n                    Lauren Silverman/KERA\n                    \n                \nhide caption Chester with Ivory (left), 11, Skylar (right), 12, and Kameron (center), 21 months. Chester and Marcus got married in 2010 and in 2014 planned to have another baby \u2014 Kameron, now 21 months. Sitting in the couch at her home in Garland, Chester admits it can be tough watching friends graduate with medical degrees or who are further along in their careers. Sometimes, she says it can feel like she failed. \"Like I gave up on my goals and dreams or messed them up. But when I look at my children I don't regret a thing. I'm not sad,\" she says through tears. \"It's just the reality of knowing my life is completely altered because of decisions I made as a teenager.\" Then Chester hears her older boys laughing upstairs, wipes her tears and goes to cheer them on.

On a recent Sunday afternoon, dozens of volunteers crammed into a small Jon Ossoff for Congress field office in Chamblee, Ga. They were there to canvass for the 30-year-old political newcomer, but they also got a treat: a speech from Ossoff himself. He only spoke for about four minutes, but he devoted almost a minute of it to women in particular. \"It's got nothing to do with me,\" he said. \"I keep saying it's got everything to do with this community and what we can achieve when we work together and so much of it as you know is being led by strong and determined women in this community who have been organizing and active who recognize that we can't \u2014 we can't go back in time.\" In several ways, this closely watched special election in Georgia's 6th Congressional District is a microcosm of national gender politics right now. Many liberal women see themselves as fueling what they call the \"resistance\" to President Trump and the Republican agenda, and they paint the GOP as a political force with a decidedly anti-woman agenda. The Republican side fights against that \"war on women\" messaging, and many women furthermore resent the idea that they'd ever let gender be a factor in their political lives. And on both sides, abortion and Planned Parenthood loom large. Ossoff knows women have played an important role in his success thus far. After garnering the most votes in the April primary, Ossoff thanked women in particular for \"stepping up and organizing.\" He told NPR that he believes women are leading a \"renaissance of civic engagement and activism,\" both in Georgia and nationwide. Those women are now trying to push him to a win in the June runoff vote \u2014 polls show that he's running neck-and-neck with Republican Karen Handel in a district that has had Republican representatives since 1979. \"I think he recognized that the army behind him were women activists and he's been incredibly grateful for that activism and energy, and I think he is the real deal,\" said Jen Cox, co-founder of Pave it Blue, a Georgia-based organization of women who want to elect left-leaning politicians. She said her organization gives women who might be new to political activism the opportunity to ease into it \u2014 marching up to someone with a clipboard and asking about their voting patterns can be intimidating. So she tells people to use whatever skills they have \u2014 to make food for fellow volunteers or research candidates' positions, for example. But it's not just about hard skills. Pave it Blue member Jenny Peterson uses her role as mother to reach out to potential Ossoff supporters. While canvassing on a blistering afternoon, Peterson met a woman home with a son with strep throat. \"We were thinking for our precinct we might try to organize a playdate for East Cobb Park,\" Peterson offered. \"Just kind of a day that we invite our voters in the precinct to bring your kids.\" Making these local connections is a big part of this kind of organizing, Peterson explained, as she climbed a hill to a large suburban house with her fellow canvasser, Elizabeth Murphy, 35. \"We're getting people to know our names and faces, because we'll be the people sitting in the camp chairs at their voting place at that park, that's where they vote,\" Peterson said, explaining that they did that during the April primary vote. \"Liz and I set up there...with camp chairs and signs, and we just waved to people as they came by.\" Gender, of course, is only one of many powerful forces driving this election. The simple fact that this race is one of the few to watch right now \u2014 in a time when liberals are itching for meaningful ways to show their opposition to Trump's GOP \u2014 plus the prospect of winning in a red-leaning district, has helped this race attract celebrity endorsements, outside money and national attention. But women like Peterson, Murphy and Pave it Blue co-founder Cox have taken their roles to heart as being a part of that \"army\" that Cox described. And while Cox is quick to say that her group doesn't want to discount men's contributions, she explains that for many women, a women-only forum is the best place to have conversations about things like reproductive rights. \"We're having pretty intimate discussions about what matters to us and what we're comfortable doing,\" Cox explained. \"And we have a common thread of, 'Our rights are at stake.' And when you invite men into a conversation that we feel should be protected, that dynamic can change.\" One more benefit that these women see in women-focused political groups is a sense of community. In between blocks, Murphy and Peterson climbed into Peterson's minivan, which bore a bumper sticker for a local group called the Liberal Moms of Roswell and Cobb. The sticker's slogan: You are not alone. \"When I first moved here I was like, oh, my god, I am the only one, you know?\" Murphy said, explaining the sticker. \"And it makes you want to be quiet. And it, like, gives you this false sense that you should hide, and you should be closeted.\" That's because conservatism is deeply embedded in this district. And attitudes toward gender and politics can be starkly different between women in either party. On the Republican side, some women resent the idea that gender would have anything to do with voting for Handel. Johsira Ezammudeen, for example, responded to the way that Ossoff calls out women as the driving force behind his campaign. \"You know, so, he can talk a lot about women. You know what? I'm not here as a woman. I am here as a citizen \u2014 American citizen,\" she said. \"When you start dividing the citizens by group like woman and then this group and then this group, you are dividing the whole nation. We are not here to divide. We're here to unify and elect somebody who's going to do what we citizens want.\" Republican candidate Karen Handel speaks at a campaign event where she was joined by House Speaker Paul Ryan in Dunwoody, Ga., on May 15, 2017.\n                \n                    \n                    David Goldman/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Republican candidate Karen Handel speaks at a campaign event where she was joined by House Speaker Paul Ryan in Dunwoody, Ga., on May 15, 2017. Ezammudeen was at the grand opening of Handel's Cobb County field office, where Handel smiled for photos with constituents while volunteers passed cake around. Even connecting gender to politics is anathema to Ezammudeen's friend, Rommys Beltran. She scoffs at the kind of identity politics she believes Democrats practice. \"We have to make a smart decision, and that's the problem that we have with the Democrats,\" Beltran said. \"They don't make smart decisions and make decisions based on hair color or stupid things like that. No, we really think about what they're saying.\" Karen Handel's gender has come into play in her political career. Her own reproductive health came into her 2010 campaign for governor. Georgia Right to Life refused to endorse Handel \u2014 part of that was because of her approval of abortion in cases of rape and incest, but part was also about fertility treatments. Handel and her husband had tried various options, unsuccessfully, in attempting to have a child. Georgia Right to Life's Steve Becker commented on those types of treatments: \"Someone's desperate right to parenthood \u2014 because they're infertile, they're barren, whatever term you want to use \u2014 is an emotionally fraught subject that has our highest sympathy,\" he said in 2010. \"But it should never be attempted to be addressed where a life is taken in the process.\" Handel has said she was stung by his usage of the words \"desperate\" and \"barren,\" and she called on Becker to resign, as the Atlanta Journal Constitution later reported. That was her first high-profile tangle over abortion, but Handel is far better-known for her brief time at the Komen Foundation, a national breast-cancer prevention organization. She landed in the middle of a national controversy in 2012 as a vice president at Komen. She pushed to end the group's funding to Planned Parenthood, which provides breast exams. That effort sparked an outcry, and Handel resigned. At the time, some predicted that Komen's brand would suffer long-term damage, and donations to Komen fell afterward. It's not something she talks about much in this campaign. And when NPR made multiple requests for an interview, her campaign said she was unavailable. But her history of opposing abortion has made her a hero to Republicans like Elaine Watson, president of the Floyd County Republican Women. \"Women can get health issues taken care of other places than Planned Parenthood,\" Watson said. \"Planned Parenthood is an abortion mill.\" Handel's latest ad touches on this topic, but it's the lightest of touches. In it, a friend of Handel's \u2014 a cancer patient named Anne \u2014 tells the camera, \"When I see ads attacking Karen Handel they make me sick. Karen is one of the strongest advocates for women's health I know.\" She goes on to tell people to \"ignore the attacks\" on Handel. It's an ad that will bring the Komen controversy to mind for many voters, even if it's not trying to change anybody's mind about it. But to those voters who don't know about the Handel-Komen connection, it signals that Ossoff is unfairly attacking Handel on the amorphous, broad topic of women's health. Perhaps the stronghold of this district's conservatism is the northern part, farther from Atlanta. This is where Handel had the strongest support in the April primary. In Mugs on Milton, a picturesque coffee shop in that northern area, moms filter in around 9:30 a.m. on weekdays after dropping off kids at local schools. One of those moms is Joy Derrer, who home-schools her six kids. (Derrer told NPR a local school caters to home-school families by bringing the kids in one day a week, allowing her to spend some time at the coffee shop.) Derrer said that she's \"pro-life,\" but that that's not the only thing she likes about Handel. \"I like that she's conservative and that she upholds the standards that are, to me, true to what has made America great,\" Derrer said. Ansley Schoen, a 20-year-old student at nearby Florida State University, likewise appreciates Handel's conservative politics, but she is one Republican woman for whom Handel's gender matters. \"I'm personally a woman trying to go into politics,\" she said, in between calls at a Georgia GOP phone bank. \"You know, there aren't as many women Republicans up in Congress, and so it'd be great to have Karen Handel for that.\"",

John Barrasso, R-Wyo., (left) and Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn of Texas (right).  They are three of the 13 senators in the health care working group. The Senate is negotiating its own legislation to repeal and replace much of the Affordable Care Act in secret talks with senators hand-picked by party leaders and with no plans for committee hearings to publicly vet the bill. \"I am encouraged by what we are seeing in the Senate. We're seeing senators leading,\" said Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, one of the 13 Republicans involved in the private talks. \"We're seeing senators working together in good faith. We're not seeing senators throwing rocks at each other, either in private or in the press.\" Senate Democrats have a different take. \"Your morning reminder that under the cloud cover of the FBI story, 13 GOP Senators are still secretly writing a bill to destroy the ACA,\" Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., tweeted Monday morning. Your morning reminder that under the cloud cover of the FBI story, 13 GOP Senators are still secretly writing a bill to destroy the ACA. Senate Republicans have shrugged away criticism about their decision to avoid action in committees in favor of closely guarded meetings in the U.S. Capitol to craft legislation to repeal and replace key pillars of President Barack Obama's health care law and reshape Medicaid. The working group has met four times, and it plans to continue to meet every Tuesday and Thursday. So far, its strategy appears to be selectively suggesting potential provisions of the legislation to the media. For instance, Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., has floated pegging tax credits to help Americans buy health insurance to their income instead of their age like it does in the House version of the bill. While the fallout over President Trump's decision to fire FBI Director James Comey consumes the news cycle, it has not had an impact on Republicans' health care talks. A GOP aide for a senator involved in the talks said it has even given the Senate some breathing room to negotiate with so much attention focused elsewhere. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell formed the negotiating team to take the lead on crafting health care legislation that can ultimately win the support of at least 50 of the chamber's 52 Republicans. No Democrats are expected to support any potential GOP health care bill. The legislation is moving under special budget rules known as reconciliation, which means it is not subject to usual filibuster rules and cannot be blocked by the minority party. Republicans ditched the House-passed bill in pursuit of their own legislation, although the two chambers share the broad goals of repealing the ACA's individual mandates and taxes, restricting access to abortion services and overhauling the Medicaid system from an open-ended federal guarantee that covers costs to a system that gives states more flexibility to spend an allotted amount of money. Conservatives like Cruz are also laying down what they say is a key marker for whether a bill can pass the Senate: \"Do premiums go up, or do they go down?\" Cruz said. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., told reporters last week that Republicans are still in the early planning phase of crafting a bill. \"We still need to agree on those goals and find out what's achievable,\" he said. Like Cruz, Johnson said for him lowering premiums is a top goal and he wants to repeal as much of the ACA as possible under the Senate's more strict budget rules. Early talks suggest Republicans are optimistic they can ultimately pass a bill by the August recess. \"We've got a group of 52 Republican senators, all of us want to get to 'yes,'\" Johnson said. Sens. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Bill Cassidy, R-La., have introduced their own health care plan, and they have been prominent voices in the debate, but they were excluded from the health care working group. Republicans were roundly criticized for not including any women in their core group, but the Republican women in the Senate who were asked about the omission said they didn't mind. \"It doesn't bother me, the leaders have the right to choose whoever they wish,\" said Collins. \"It doesn't mean that I'm not going to work on health care.\" Cassidy and Collins have been moderating voices in the health care debate, and their support or opposition could be critical to Republicans' success. The Cassidy-Collins proposal would let states keep the ACA, also known as Obamacare, in place if they wanted to, and it leaves in place the ACA's taxes and fees to have revenue streams to pay for their health care overhaul. However, their plan doesn't enjoy support among conservatives who don't believe it goes far enough to repeal and replace Obamacare \u2014 the party's signature campaign pledge. The duo has been reaching out to Democrats, but Cassidy said his efforts have been rejected. Democrats see no policy or political upside to working with Republicans to dismantle the ACA. \"Let me phrase this carefully. I've had seven or eight meetings with Democrats either in their office, maybe once my office or on the floor, and that was the consistent message I got,\" Cassidy said. Most Republicans see no political advantage to attempting to craft bipartisan legislation that could aid vulnerable Red State Senate Democrats heading in to the midterm elections. In other words, there is mutual disinterest in bipartisanship when it comes to the fundamentals of Obamacare. The GOP health care talks are expected to roll through the summer months in the Senate. The long-term strategy \u2014 according to senior GOP aides in both the House and Senate \u2014 is to pass a Senate bill and send it back to the House for an up-or-down vote. While House passage of their bill was hailed by the president in an unusual Rose Garden ceremony earlier this month, Republicans are still a long way away from fulfilling their campaign promises on health care.",

            "article_content": "Women in the Trump era are asserting themselves \u2014 in resistance and support. A Georgia House race, with a controversial Republican woman running, tells the story of the divide among women.  SCOTT SIMON, HOST: Women are playing a big role in a closely watched special election in the suburbs of Atlanta. Many are organizing for a Democrat named Jon Ossoff. He is running against Republican named Karen Handel, and she would be the first woman to represent this district. NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben was in Georgia this week ahead of next month's race. DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN, BYLINE: Jon Ossoff stopped at a field office in Chamblee last weekend to thank campaign volunteers for turning out. JON OSSOFF: I think we had probably about 400 people out yesterday. KURTZLEBEN: He only spoke for four minutes, but he devoted a chunk of that speech to one particular group of supporters. OSSOFF: And so much of it, as you know, is being led by strong and determined women in this community who have been organizing and active, who recognize that we can't go back in time. KURTZLEBEN: Three hours later and 20 miles away, Republican Karen Handel celebrated the opening of a new field office this way. KAREN HANDEL: We're going to get this done. And on June 20, what are we going to do? Kick some Ossoff. KURTZLEBEN: Handel didn't mention women in her brief speech. But supporter Johsira Ezammudeen responded to Ossoff's comments about gender. JOHSIRA EZAMMUDEEN: You know, so he can talk a lot about woman. You know what? I'm not here as a woman. I am here as a citizen - American citizen. KURTZLEBEN: In more than a few ways, this closely watched election is a microcosm of national gender politics right now. Many liberal women see themselves as fueling what they call the resistance to President Trump and the Republican agenda. And on both sides, abortion and Planned Parenthood loom large. Rebecca Grant, who came out to volunteer for Ossoff, explained. REBECCA GRANT: The Planned Parenthood cause is also close to my heart. And I think we need more people out there fighting for maintaining women's rights and their access to fair and equal care. KURTZLEBEN: Handel's candidacy amplifies the issue. She landed in the middle of a national controversy in 2012 as a vice president at the Komen Foundation, a breast cancer nonprofit. She pushed to end the group's funding to Planned Parenthood. That effort sparked an outcry, and Handel resigned. It's not something she talks about much in this campaign. And when NPR made multiple requests for an interview, her campaign said she was unavailable. But her history of opposing abortion has made her a hero to Republicans like Elaine Watson, president of the Floyd County Republican Women. ELAINE WATSON: Women can get health issues taken care of other places than Planned Parenthood. Planned Parenthood is an abortion mill. KURTZLEBEN: That kind of staunchly conservative ideology is common in this district and that made Elizabeth Murphy feel isolated when she moved here. ELIZABETH MURPHY: When I first moved here I was like, oh, my god, I am the only one, you know? And it makes you want to be quiet. And it, like, gives you this false sense that you should hide, and you should be closeted. KURTZLEBEN: Murphy was out door knocking for Ossoff on a blazing hot afternoon as part of the local Democratic women's group, Pave It Blue. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Hi. MURPHY: Hi there. Are you Megan? KURTZLEBEN: For Murphy, groups like Pave It Blue give liberal women a sense of community. The next morning in the suburb of Milton, a Handel stronghold, moms started streaming into a local coffee shop around 9:30 after dropping off kids at local schools. One of those moms was Joy Derrer. JOY DERRER: I have six children. I am a stay-at-home mom, yes. KURTZLEBEN: She said she's \"pro-life,\" but that she's also drawn to Handel's traditional values. DERRER: I like that she's conservative and that she upholds the standards that are, to me, true to what has made America great. KURTZLEBEN: Later that morning, at a GOP phone bank, 20-year-old Ansley Schoen said gender is a part - but small - of why she supports Handel. ANSLEY SCHOEN: I'm personally a woman trying to go into politics, so it's - you know, there aren't as many women Republicans up in Congress, and so be great to have Karen Handel for that. KURTZLEBEN: Schoen went back to making calls, trying to get a Handel elected. But Ossoff is the one relying on women to put him over the finish line. And this race here in Georgia may be an early test of whether the energy progressive women have shown so far in the Trump presidency can bring Democrats back to power in Washington.

            "article_content": "Republicans were able to avoid an embarrassing loss of a House seat in Georgia to Democrats Tuesday night. It now heads to a one-on-one matchup in June.  ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: Republicans are breathing a sigh of relief after last night's special election in Georgia where a Democrat came up just shy of winning a House seat that's been in GOP hands for decades. Democrat Jon Ossoff received lots of attention and an unheard of amount of money from progressives across the country, and now Ossoff is headed to a runoff in late June against Republican Karen Handel, who came out ahead of 10 other Republican candidates last night. NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson joins us from the White House. And Mara, what did you make of last night's result? MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Well, there was bad news and good news for Democrats. They fell short. But the good news is that Ossoff, who was a neophyte candidate with no record was able to make this race a referendum on Donald Trump, and he over-performed his polling. The private and public polls showed that he was in the low-40s, but he cracked 48 percent. And that means Democrats did well enough last night that they will probably continue pouring money into all of these special elections. We've got another one in Montana coming up on May 25. SIEGEL: Well, does this one special election race give us any sign for what to look for heading into the 2018 midterms? LIASSON: I think it tells us a couple of things. Number one, Democrats have a lot of organic enthusiasm, and there's some Republican disenchantment with Trump in districts like this one in Georgia. We know that Republicans still have a lot of structural advantages. They have a lot of resources. The House and Senate maps favor them. We also have learned that Democrats seem to have decided the only answer to their predicament is to run everywhere to try to replenish their pipeline. They are a hollowed-out party, and they seem to understand they have to build from the grassroots. And to put all this in context, this district was very Republican, but there are about two dozen other districts out there that Hillary Clinton won and that are held by Republicans. The 6th District of Georgia wouldn't have even made it to the top 50 races the Democrats want to target next year. Now, on the other hand, the Democrats need two dozen seats to take the House back, so they do have a very steep hill to climb. SIEGEL: And we should note this was the seat vacated by Congressman Tom Price being elevated to secretary of health and human services. John Ossoff, the Democrat's, gotten a lot of attention. We haven't heard as much about his GOP opponent, Karen Handel. What can you tell us about her? LIASSON: She was the secretary of state of Georgia. She has statewide name I.D. She has run twice for other statewide offices unsuccessfully in Republican primaries for governor and Senate. She also was a former official at the Susan G. Komen Foundation. She had to resign amidst that controversy over the cancer group's decision not to give grants to Planned Parenthood. That's a decision that was later reversed. But Karen Handel has impeccable pro-life credentials. She's a pro-life heroine for that Susan G. Komen controversy. We don't know if that's going to help her or hurt her in this district. During the primary, she kept her distance from Donald Trump. She was probably the most Trump-ambivalent of all the Republicans. But now Handel says she would be happy for the president to come in and campaign for her. SIEGEL: Now, there is another bit of political news today. Jason Chaffetz, the Utah Republican congressman who chairs the House Oversight Committee, said that he is not running for re-election next year. What do we know about that? LIASSON: He says he's returning to the private sector. He's been very coy about his political future. He does say he will not challenge Utah Republican Senator Orrin Hatch, who said he will run next time. But Chaffetz might run for governor in 2020. He was asked about that recently, and he said that he's definitely maybe running for governor. I think what this tells us is that being in Congress is not necessarily the best platform right now for Republicans to run for higher office. And in general, a party trying to defend its majority in the House does not want a lot of these retirements because open seats are harder to defend than incumbents. So Chaffetz' decision was probably not good news for Paul Ryan. SIEGEL: That's NPR's Mara Liasson joining us from the White House. Mara, thanks. LIASSON: Thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2017 NPR.

Komen for the Cure foundation. She landed in controversy there about Planned Parenthood funding. If you thought it was odd that a special election in the Atlanta suburbs got so much national attention, you haven't seen anything yet. So far, much of the focus has been on Democrat Jon Ossoff \u2014 and with good reason. The Democratic base rallied around him and made the election a referendum on President Trump. In some ways, it worked. Ossoff came within 3,648 votes of winning the right-leaning congressional seat outright in Georgia's 6th Congressional District. He needed 50 percent to do that; he got just over 48 percent. That outperformed where he was polling, and was better than the Democrat who ran for Congress in 2016 against then-incumbent Tom Price, who vacated the seat to become Trump's Health and Human Services secretary. \"There is no doubt this is already a victory for the ages,\" Ossoff claimed Tuesday night. But it is more like just missing a home run in baseball \u2014 \"It is high! It is deep! It is ... foul.\" It still makes Ossoff dangerous, but now his opponent gets a turn at bat. That opponent, who emerged from a field of 11 Republicans, is Karen Handel, a familiar name in Georgia politics who, not that long ago, was at the center of national controversy. Who is Karen Handel? There's something of a three-strikes rule in politics \u2014 lose three big races in a row, and you're out as a top candidate. Handel is now on her third try. The former Georgia secretary of state lost twice in subsequent bids for statewide higher office \u2014 once for governor and once for the U.S. Senate. Now, because of the conservative bent of the 6th Congressional District, she is likely to be the favorite against Ossoff on June 20. But she is about to get a lot more national attention, and her role in an attempt to strip funding to Planned Parenthood from the Susan G. Komen foundation may just keep the liberal base fired up. Handel is conservative, especially when it comes to abortion rights. After her failed gubernatorial bid in 2010, she joined the Komen foundation. As a vice president, she pushed to eliminate its funding of Planned Parenthood. After an outcry from women who help fund Komen, the money was restored, and Handel resigned in February 2012. She went on to write a scathing book that detailed her experience and blasted Planned Parenthood. It was called Planned Bullyhood. She opens the book by taking the reader back to a pivotal moment \u2014 an interview with the head of Komen, Nancy Brinker, by NBC's Andrea Mitchell, whom Handel bitterly derides on Page 1 as \"an ardent liberal and breast cancer survivor\" who was \"enraged\" at Komen's decision to cut off funding. Handel wrote that the Komen decision was not a \"political\" one but an \"economic one\" that was \"months even years in the making.\" She writes, \"To Planned Parenthood and its opportunistic friends in the [Obama] White House and Congress, daring to walk away would not be tolerated.\" She said when Mitchell mentioned her name, then she became \"the focus of the fury of the left.\" Five days later, she resigned. In her book, Handel makes it sound as though she was a scapegoat. But that hardly seems to be the case. The New York Times and others reported that Handel, who is against federal funding of Planned Parenthood, was instrumental in the funding cut. Here's what the New York Times wrote the day after the Brinker interview on MSNBC: \"The controversy that burst into harsh public light this week had been brewing for years as anti-abortion advocates dogged the Komen foundation, protesting alongside its fund-raising events and complaining loudly about the grants to Planned Parenthood, which performs abortions as well as providing a broad range of other health services to women. \" 'We are really afraid, because these people who are opposed to Planned Parenthood were threatening to disrupt our races or sponsors to our races,' said John Hammarley, a Komen senior communications adviser until late last summer. ... \"The discussion within Komen about addressing the objections of anti-abortion advocates intensified last year after Karen Handel was hired as senior vice president for public policy, several former Komen employees said.\" The Atlantic's Jeffrey Goldberg on the same day of the Brinker interview: \"The decision to create a rule that would cut funding to Planned Parenthood, according to these sources, was driven by the organization's new senior vice president for public policy, Karen Handel, a former gubernatorial candidate from Georgia who is staunchly anti-abortion and who has said that since she is 'pro-life, I do not support the mission of Planned Parenthood.' ... \"The decision, made in December, caused an uproar inside Komen. Three sources told me that the organization's top public-health official, Mollie Williams, resigned in protest immediately following the Komen board's decision to cut off Planned Parenthood. ... \"[Hammarley] called the controversy over Planned Parenthood funding 'a burr in the saddle of Komen, but it withstood the issue for years and years.' Hammarley said the issue became newly urgent after Handel was brought on last year. 'The internal debate on a senior level rose in the past eight months or so, coinciding with her hiring.' \" Distancing from Trump ... and then not Handel is a pretty traditional conservative. In addition to being anti-abortion rights, she's for lower income taxes, cutting regulations and stricter voter ID laws. Those are hardly deal-breakers in a conservative district that has been in Republican hands since the Carter administration. In fact, the opposite is probably true. But the one area where Handel did seem reticent was about the president. \"I certainly support the president and will work with him where we agree,\" Handel said, per AP. \"But my job is not to go to Congress as a rubber stamp for anybody. My job is to be the representative for the people of the 6th District, and that's what I believe regardless of who is the president.\" That was pretty par for the course for Handel during the campaign. There were plenty of others who were trying to out-Trump each other. But in the district, packed with suburban, well-educated Republicans, Trump underperformed. He won by fewer than 2 points in 2016, while Price won by 23. But that's a posture from Handel that might not be sustainable, and she is indicating it won't be. She got just under 20 percent of the vote in the primary. Given that she was in an 11-candidate field, it was actually about as impressive a showing as could be expected. On Wednesday morning, asked on CNN if she would want Trump to campaign for her, she said, \"I would hope so. I mean look, all Republicans, it's all hands on deck for us.\" White House press secretary Sean Spicer on Wednesday said the president would do what's needed. Handel said she recognizes that it's an important race, indicating she understands the deluge to come. Trump is certainly paying attention. He took a measure of credit after midnight Wednesday in a tweet, claiming victory: Despite major outside money, FAKE media support and eleven Republican candidates, BIG \"R\" win with runoff in Georgia. Glad to be of help! And then, eight hours later, he name-dropped Handel: Dems failed in Kansas and are now failing in Georgia. Great job Karen Handel! It is now Hollywood vs. Georgia on June 20th. Between now and next year's midterms, Trump may very well be the most important issue in every race \u2014 whether Republicans want him to be or not.",

Leonard Lance, R-N.J., at a town hall meeting at Raritan Valley Community College on Feb. 22.\n                \n                    \n                    Eduardo Munoz Alvarez/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Rep. Leonard Lance, R-N.J., at a town hall meeting at Raritan Valley Community College on Feb. 22. What's the political definition of a moderate? For Republicans like New Jersey Rep. Leonard Lance, it means taking hits from all sides. At his third town hall of the year \u2014 his 43rd in his congressional career \u2014 Lance took incoming from his constituents for more than an hour on Wednesday evening. \"Do your jobs! Work together!\" yelled Janet Katz, a Chester resident and constituent who was one of a handful of the hundreds in attendance who got to ask a question. (To avoid the appearance of stacking the deck, Lance's constituents are given ticket numbers that are pulled at random.) Katz, like most constituents here, came to voice opposition to the GOP's health care bill, efforts to cut funding for Planned Parenthood and general intransigence of Washington. \"If everybody doesn't get exactly what they want, then there's a win. Compromise!\" Katz ordered. Lance responded, \"I agree with that, and I hope the Democrats will come to the table.\" She shot back: \"I hope the Republicans will come to the table!\" Katz wants to keep the Affordable Care Act intact and for lawmakers to fix the system, not tear it down. \"I want this repeal crap to stop,\" she said, to a cheering audience. Lance is already on her side. He is a \"no\" vote on his party's health care bill. He reiterated his vow to oppose any bill that rolls back protections for people with pre-existing health conditions, as well as the other popular provisions of the law that mandate minimum coverage standards. Lance did not win over Katz or the room, however, with his position to redirect Planned Parenthood funds to other health care providers that do not offer abortion services. His health care positions have likewise provoked attacks from the other side of the spectrum. The conservative grass-roots activist group Club for Growth is targeting moderates like Lance in a recent wave of attack ads. Conservative activists want the GOP bill to go further to fully repeal the law and start all over. \"Tell Leonard Lance, don't fall for fake repeal. Vote 'no' on Ryancare and get rid of Obamacare for good,\" the ad states. This is life in the political middle in 2017, and Lance is at the center of it all. After the 2016 elections, his wealthy, suburban northern New Jersey district became the new new media seat in Congress: not too conservative, not too liberal, just right \u2014 of center. That's according to the nonpartisan Cook Political Report that ranks districts based on their partisan leanings every two years. In the spectrum of 435 House seats, Lance's is ranked 218th. He is also one of 23 House Republicans who represent a district Hillary Clinton carried last November, by a narrow, 1 percentage-point margin. Those results means fresh challenges to being a Republican moderate with Donald Trump now in the White House. The president is really unpopular in Lance's district among Democrats like Barbara Babcock, a retired teacher and Flanders resident who also attended Lance's town hall. \"The current administration is ruining the Republican brand,\" she said. \"And I think anybody who really cares about standard Republicanism as it used to be, really needs to stand up to this administration and I'd like to see my congressman do that.\" A Fairleigh Dickinson University poll in late March gave Trump an approval rating of just 28 percent in the Garden State. Which means Lance is often eager to distance himself from the Republican pack. At his town hall, he called on the president to release his tax returns, embraced the need to address man-made climate change and criticized the president's early round of executive orders on immigration. For every chit he earns from some constituents for taking more centrist positions than many Republicans in his party, it can leave others feeling disappointed. \"You know I was hoping that once they had the Senate, the Congress, and the White House, they would do a little bit more,\" said Roxanne Wallace, another of Lance's constituents at the town hall. She believes Trump is showing leadership and doing a pretty good job, and she wants to see Republicans work with him to deliver now that they control Washington. She's not impressed so far. \"They seem to buckle all the time when somebody starts screaming or protesting or using their thumb up signs. They buckle,\" she said. Energized Democrats and frustrated Republicans are a political mix that will keep Lance's district at the very top of the list for competitive races in next year's midterms. That combination was already on display at last night's town hall as the congressman faced repeated catcalls and taunts about losing next year. But the congressman didn't want to go there yet. \"I believe 2018 will take care of itself,\" he said. \"I want 2017 to be a year of governance, where we can come together and work in a bipartisan and bicameral capacity.\" That's a pretty moderate message. It's just not clear yet who's listening.",

Updated: Tues., 4/11/17, 9:50 a.m. ET Democrats are hoping to prove that the growing opposition to President Trump is very real with an upset in one \u2014 or possibly even two \u2014 upcoming special congressional elections. Their best chance is in Georgia's 6th District, where Republicans are scrambling to stop Democrat Jon Ossoff from winning the contest outright with a majority of the vote in an April 18 all-party primary. But now there's growing concern over a previously sleepy race in Kansas to replace new CIA Director Mike Pompeo. Fearing a low-turnout election and an underperforming GOP candidate, Republicans are sending in their cavalry at the eleventh hour to prevent an upset in the race that's headed to the polls Tuesday. That's still an unlikely outcome, but if Democrats keep the race in ruby red Kansas close, it could give them more momentum and optimism heading into Georgia the following week. Ossoff and Democrats hope to \"Make Trump Furious\" A 30-year-old documentary filmmaker and former congressional staffer, Ossoff has become a vehicle for the anti-Trump sentiment nationwide. He announced this week that he had raised an eye-popping $8.3 million in the race \u2014 an unheard of number for a congressional contest in such a short time. But 95 percent of that came from out-of-state donors, with the help of progressive blogs and celebrity endorsements. Still, that money has allowed him to dwarf his opponents on air and build an impressive field organization that's put him just within reach of winning with a majority outright on April 18 \u2014 a nearly unthinkable feat in an 18-candidate field. Republicans, at this point, just need to keep Ossoff below 50 percent and force him into a June 20 runoff, where they feel much better about the chances that one of several candidates who have emerged as top-tier challengers \u2014 most likely former Georgia Secretary of State Karen Handel, Johns Creek City Councilman Bob Gray, state Sen. Judson Hill or former state Sen. Dan Moody \u2014 would have against Ossoff then. National Republican groups have poured about $4 million into the race to knock down Ossoff, looking to tie him to House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. \u2014 still toxic with the GOP base and a motivating factor to turn out their voters, Republicans say \u2014 at and to argue he's tried to embellish his national security credentials. One ad last week from the Congressional Leadership Fund, a superPAC with ties to House leadership, went for the jugular by pointing out Ossoff's documentary company had received money from \"Al Jazeera, a media outlet that has been described as a mouthpiece for terrorists.\" This is the type of district that's primed for a possible upset \u2014 even though now-Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price won re-election easily here time after time, Trump carried Georgia's 6th District by only 1 point last year after Mitt Romney won it by 23 points in 2012. This is the northern Atlanta suburbs \u2014 a growing, diverse and well-educated area, just like the places where Trump struggled mightily last fall. With the GOP field fractured, Ossoff has been able to corral his considerable resources into a sizable advantage, and his best shot is to deliver a knockout punch and win the April 18 contest outright. If he's pushed into a runoff, and the race becomes a more traditional contest and GOP attacks have more time to permeate, winning Tom Price's old House seat looks much harder for Ossoff. Panic in Kansas? This contest on Tuesday is giving Republicans some late heartburn, as they're worried about a low-turnout contest, a depressed GOP base and an underperforming nominee. Unlike the Georgia district up for grabs next week, the 4th Congressional District in Kansas, which includes Wichita, is one Trump won comfortably by 27 points. But the race has largely flown under the radar, and Republicans worry their base may not show up for GOP nominee Rob Estes, the state treasurer. So in the eleventh hour, Republicans are now sending in their cavalry. The National Republican Congressional Committee went up with an ad last week hitting Democratic nominee James Thompson on his position on abortion rights, Vice President Pence has recorded a robo-call on Estes' behalf and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz \u2014 who won Kansas big in the state's presidential caucuses last year \u2014 will campaign with Estes on Monday. Also working against Republicans is Gov. Sam Brownback's unpopularity in the state, and Thompson has tried to tie Estes to the governor. Ultimately, the late help will still probably be enough to pull Estes over the finish line on Tuesday, and there's been no major late surge of interest by national Democrats in the race that would signify that they have a real chance of pulling off an upset. In fact, the state party turned down requests from Thompson for help last month. But a closer-than-expected result could only give Democrats more momentum and optimism heading into Georgia the following week. Is Montana next on upset watch? If there's an upset in Georgia and if the Kansas contest is close, expect progressive activists to turn their sights to this May 25 contest between Republican Greg Gianforte and Democrat Rob Quist to become the state's lone representative in the House. Technology entrepreneur Greg Gianforte speaks to Republican delegates before a candidate forum in Helena, Mont., last month.\n                \n                    \n                    Matt Volz/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Technology entrepreneur Greg Gianforte speaks to Republican delegates before a candidate forum in Helena, Mont., last month. Democrats have been able to break through in the state's gubernatorial and Senate races (though Sen. Jon Tester is a top target in 2018) but they haven't held the state's only House seat in almost two decades. And without a significant late shift toward Quist, Gianforte, a wealthy software executive who ran unsuccessfully for governor last year, still looks poised to win. Progressive groups such as the Daily Kos and Democracy for America have looked to boost Quist, a banjo-playing folk and bluegrass singer who has written his own campaign song. The Democratic nominee, who's making his first run for office, has jabbed at Gianforte for keeping a low profile while Quist has held town halls across the state. Quist, however, has his own problems with tax liens, which he has blamed on medical costs and insurance prices, according to Montana Public Radio. The GOP superPAC Congressional Leadership Fund has already hit Quist with $700,000 in attack ads, too, painting him as too liberal. Ultimately, the GOP-lean of the state which Trump won by 21 points and Gianforte's deep pockets still looks like too much for Democrats to overcome. But, like Kansas, this one could take on a life of its own late in the game. Remember, special elections are still special If Democrats are able to pull off wins in any of these contests, the party will be crowing that this spells doom for President Trump and Republicans in the 2018 midterms. And, to be sure, it would be a devastating blow for any House seat this early on in Trump's already-struggling presidency to switch hands \u2014 especially ones previously held by his Cabinet members. Ultimately, House special elections are snapshots in time \u2014 and right now Democrats need to be able to prove their opposition to Trump, with protests and marches, isn't just all talk and no results. Winning one of these races would prove they can turn their grass-roots' anti-Trump sentiment into real blowback at the ballot box. But it's also not a guarantee of future success, and if Ossoff wins, for example, he'd start out with a target on his back in 2018, when the weird dynamics of a multicandidate field aren't in play and he'd have much more trouble raising millions of dollars if he isn't the only game in town. However, if Ossoff doesn't win, that isn't a signal, either, of Democratic fortunes in 2018. Democrats have plenty of other targets beyond Georgia's 6th District to put the House in play, as well. Midterm elections of a first-term president are a referendum on the commander in chief, and if Trump's approval continues to sink and his administration continues to be mired in controversy, there will by myriad opportunities for Democrats. California and South Carolina: the other races Beyond that trio of more compelling contests, there are two other vacancies still to be voted on. The 23-way California contest to succeed now-state Attorney General Xavier Becerra in California's 34th Congressional District was whittled down April 4, with Assemblyman Jimmy Gomez and Los Angeles Planning Commissioner Robert Lee Ahn advancing to a June 6 runoff. Progressive groups had hoped to get one of their favorite candidates through in this Los Angeles district where Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders beat Hillary Clinton in the Democratic primary last year. But with that vote splintered, Ahn was able to edge through, benefiting from a growing Asian population in the district. Gomez was the front-runner to begin with, and probably remains as such in the runoff. He raised the most money of any candidate in the race and has secured endorsements from many Democratic insiders, including Becerra. In South Carolina, whoever wins the GOP nomination in the 5th Congressional District will be a near-lock to succeed White House Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney. The overwhelming number of votes in this race will come from York County, the largest area of the district that's seen a boom as a growing suburb of Charlotte. Former state Rep. Ralph Norman, whose family owns a major real estate development company in the area, already has a base in the area, and he resigned from the Legislature to focus on the race. State House Speaker Pro Tempore Tommy Pope represents part of the district's base in Columbia, too, and he already has name recognition in the state from being the lead prosecutor on the high-profile 1994 case of Susan Smith, the mother who was found guilty of drowning her two young sons in a car. The primary is on May 2, and Republicans in the state say Pope and Norman have the best chance to advance to a likely May 16 runoff if no candidate gets a majority. But former state GOP Chairman Chad Connelly, who was faith engagement director for the Republican National Committee, has run a strong campaign too and could pull in votes from heavily evangelical voters. Ultimately, the GOP primary is shaping up to be a contest about who's the most conservative, and don't expect to see candidates shirk away from Trump as they play up their praise of Mulvaney. Whoever wins the nomination will be the heavy favorite come June. Democrats haven't held the seat since John Spratt, the then-Budget Committee chairman, was defeated by Mulvaney in 2010, and the seat has only gotten more Republican since then, voting for Trump by almost 20 points.",

            "article_content": "There are special elections this week to fill seats left open by President Trump's cabinet picks. One is in Georgia, the other is in Kansas, and they've become expressions of anger from Democrats.  LOURDES GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST: When President Trump began looking to staff his administration, his search took him to the House of Representatives. Vacancies there by now Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price and CIA Director Mike Pompeo are being filled in special elections. Both men represented usually reliably Republican areas, one in Georgia, the other in Kansas. But in this new age of unpredictable politics, these contests have become surprising vehicles for Democratic opposition to Trump. NPR political reporter Jessica Taylor has been following these races, and she's here to talk about them with us. Hey, Jessica. JESSICA TAYLOR, BYLINE: Hey, Lulu. GARCIA-NAVARRO: All right. Voting this Tuesday; next Tuesday, the race on the 18 has gotten, though, most of the attention. It's Tom Price's seat in Georgia. What are the chances of an upset? TAYLOR: They're surprisingly good. And this is the type of district that's primed for an upset. You know, Trump was successful at flipping blue-collar districts in Michigan and Wisconsin, but his Achilles heel were these suburban, affluent, growing, diverse districts in places like this, the northern Atlanta suburbs. Romney won this district easily four years ago, but Trump won it by just one point. So you have Democrat Jon Ossoff there. He's a 30-year-old documentary filmmaker and former congressional staffer. He's raised an eye-popping $8.3 million for this race. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Wow. TAYLOR: But the caveat is that 95 percent of this came from out of the state. GARCIA-NAVARRO: So saying that there's a lot of opposition to Trump around the country but maybe not a lot of support for him in the district that he's running. TAYLOR: Right. He's hovering at about 40 percent IN sort of this really big, all-party primary, 18-candidate field, so he really needs a knockout punch to sort of win this on the first go. GARCIA-NAVARRO: So I'm curious, if Ossoff does win, what message does that send to the Republicans? TAYLOR: Well, you know, Democrats are going to say this shows that we can run on this anti-Trump resistance, that their progressive movement - dormant - has sort of gained new life. And that's what Republicans don't want to happen. So that's why they're pouring a lot of money into trying to defeat him to at least get into the runoff. So they've spent over $4 million on ads, really trying to tear him down, hitting him for padding his resume and for taking money from Al Jazeera as a filmmaker. So here's one ad that sort of shows how far they're going, Congressional Leadership Fund, here. (SOUNDBITE OF AD) UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As character) Al Jazeera - a media outlet that has been described as a mouthpiece for terrorists - has been paying Jon Ossoff thousands of dollars. But Jon refuses to tell voters exactly how much money he's received. GARCIA-NAVARRO: So that's Georgia. What's happening this Tuesday in Kansas with the CIA director, Mike Pompeo's, seat? TAYLOR: This one's a lot closer than it should be. Republicans still have an edge there. So this seat, Trump won pretty easily - 27 points. But you have a possible low turnout election, and you have some Kansas Republicans grumbling that their nominee, State Treasurer Ron Estes, hasn't run the best campaign. So you have national Republicans really sort of sending in their cavalry at the last minute, which shows just how worried they are. They're running ads hitting Democrat James Thompson for his support on abortion rights. Vice President Pence is making robocalls. And then you have Ted Cruz campaigning with Estes on Monday. I think Estes will probably pull it out, but if it's closer than expected, I think that only gives Democrats more momentum as sort of optimism going into the contest a week later in Georgia. GARCIA-NAVARRO: That's NPR political reporter Jessica Taylor. Jessica, thanks so much. TAYLOR: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF ANTIBALAS' \"N.E.S.T.A. 75\") Copyright \u00a9 2017 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Some Republicans still do. President Barack Obama stepped to the microphone in the White House briefing room and had a job to do \u2014 make the case for a major change made by his party's Senate leader to how the chamber works. \"Ultimately, if you got a majority of folks who believe in something, then it should be able to pass,\" Obama said in 2013 after then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., changed the rules of the Senate to require a simple majority to allow for judiciary nominees other than those for the Supreme Court to proceed to a final vote for confirmation. The irony of that made it a line that conservatives were resurfacing Monday, as Democrats fielded enough votes to sustain a filibuster against Judge Neil Gorsuch, President Trump's Supreme Court nominee. As a result, the Senate looks like it is careening toward a \"nuclear\" showdown by the end of this week. It is increasingly likely that Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., will blow up \u2014 so to speak \u2014 how the Senate works (perhaps forever) and eliminate the 60-vote requirement to end debate and advance a nominee for the high court. Of course, the context for Obama's speech is important. Back in 2013, nominee after nominee was thwarted by the GOP minority, despite each's qualifications. As Obama also pointed out in his speech, the ones who did eventually get through did so with big majorities and few, if any, dissenters. There were a record number of cloture motions filed during the Obama years when the GOP was in the minority. (Cloture motions are essentially what's used to end debate, which takes 60 votes, or stop a filibuster.) The filibuster has taken on new meaning over the years and been used by both parties. But its increased use by Republicans in particular over the past decade has been a big part of what has led the Senate to this point. The chart below shows just how much McConnell's use of the filibuster spiked in the Obama era and how much it has grown over the past 40 years: \"It's brought us to the point where a simple majority vote no longer seems to be sufficient for anything \u2014 even routine business \u2014 through what is supposed to be the greatest deliberative body,\" Obama said in 2013. Modern use of the filibuster has frustrated presidents of both parties. But typically, the filibuster is not an issue with Supreme Court nominees. There's long been a tradition of deferring to the president to pick his justices, so long as that nominee is qualified. Democrats didn't filibuster Clarence Thomas, for example, and he was among the most controversial nominees in history. He was confirmed only 52-48. But there was no deferring to the president last year, when Obama nominated Merrick Garland, the chief judge of the second-highest court in the land, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Garland wasn't filibustered; there was never the opportunity. McConnell refused to even let him have a committee hearing. \"[I]f seven months of preventing Judge Merrick Garland from getting a hearing and a vote is anything, it is the longest and most successful partisan filibuster in Senate history,\" Democratic Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware said Monday in explaining why he was supporting a filibuster. Now, there are concerns that the elimination of the filibuster for Supreme Court nominees will make the nominating process more partisan \u2014 that in 50 years if the court has changed with less qualified justices on it, people will look back on this week for when it all happened. George W. Bush's pick of White House counsel Harriet Miers was derailed by conservatives \u2014 from those who were uncomfortable with the fact that she didn't have a public record of opposition to abortion to those who thought she wasn't qualified.

Among those who didn't think she was qualified, ironically, was conservative legal scholar Robert Bork. Bork is the same former Supreme Court nominee who is at the heart of the seeds of Republican resentment toward Democrats over high court nominees. Bork was the last nominee outright rejected by the Senate. That happened 30 years ago, but Republicans are still smarting over it. Bork's name has even become a verb. As The Atlantic defines, being \"borked\" means \"to have one's nomination to high office be subject to zealous political attack.\" After Bork, someone who didn't shy away from making his views public, nominees instead became coached on how to say as little as possible in confirmation hearings. The other Republican irritation is Miguel Estrada, a Harvard Law grad who had his nomination to a federal judgeship on the D.C. Circuit in 2003 blocked by a Democratic filibuster. Democrats believed he was not forthcoming enough, because he didn't provide \"documents and information about his legal views,\" Janet Hook wrote in the Los Angeles Times. By the way, here's a peek at the politics back then with some familiar storylines from the piece: \"Estrada's nomination also has become a cause celebre among liberal and conservative activists, increasing the pressure on Democratic and Republican Senate leaders to lock horns over the issue. The activists view the nomination as a trial run for a future fight: a possible vacancy on the U.S. Supreme Court. Adding to the stakes, Republicans have sought to turn the battle over Estrada, 41, into a proxy war for the political loyalty of Latino voters, whom Bush has made a point of courting.\" Both sides have their grievances. And those grievances are adding up to something that no one on either side seems happy about \u2014 forever changing the \"world's greatest deliberative body\" into ... something else.",

Tim Scott of South Carolina last month.\n                \n                    \n                    Sean Rayford/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption People are talking about the ACA at town hall meetings around the nation, like this one with Republican Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina last month. Last year, when presidential candidate Donald Trump hammered the Affordable Care Act as \"a fraud,\" \"a total disaster\" and \"very bad health insurance,\" many Americans seemed to agree with him. Now that President Trump and fellow Republicans are attempting to keep their promise to get rid of the law, voters increasingly seem to be having second thoughts. Multiple polls show rising support for the ACA, including one from the Pew Research Center and one from the Wall Street Journal/NBC News indicating Americans feel more positively about it than ever. True, many still dislike the law known as Obamacare, but as the national conversation swells on the fate of a law that affects millions of people in multifaceted ways \u2014 and the issue takes center stage at raucous town hall meetings \u2014 it's increasingly clear that many don't see the ACA as an either-or proposition. \"At first it was a good deal \u2014 that was three or four years ago,\" says Mark Bunkosky, 56, an independent contractor in Michigan who buys coverage through one of the law's online portals. \"Every year it's gone up. From where it started, the premium has doubled, and now my deductible has also doubled. And my income has not doubled.\" Bunkosky, a Republican, views the ACA unfavorably but believes Washington should fix it, not toss it. He supports keeping some of the law's Medicaid coverage for low-income people and its prohibition on discriminating against those with pre-existing conditions. This week, Trump acknowledged that health care is \"so complicated.\" So are voter opinions on what to do next with the ACA, which expanded coverage to some 20 million people. \"I didn't like that it mandated people to carry health insurance. And I thought it was just a lie\" when it promised affordability, says Amber Alexander, 27, a Pennsylvania independent whose seasonal income puts her on Medicaid in winter and a commercial plan the rest of the year. However, she adds, \"I don't think it should be thrown out altogether. There are people that do benefit from it, but there are also a lot of people that get screwed.\" Carol Friendly, 67, an Oregon Republican, voted for Hillary Clinton for president and favors the Medicaid expansion. She objects to the ACA's reproductive health coverage, though, saying consumers opposed to birth control and abortion shouldn't have to pay for them. On the other hand, she says, \"I know it put 22 million [people] in the health care system that weren't there before. So that's a plus.\" Mixed signals from Republicans add to the political fog. For weeks, Trump has been promising \u2014 but not yet producing \u2014 a blueprint detailing his plan to repeal and replace the ACA with \"insurance for everybody.\" In his address to Congress on Tuesday, he said a new law \"should ensure that Americans with pre-existing conditions have access to coverage.\" Meanwhile, a leaked GOP congressional draft replacement bill would shrink coverage subsidies, and House conservatives complained even those were still too expensive. On Tuesday, congressional Republicans told reporters they were still working on \"the best way to build a consensus to pass a bill to gut Obamacare.\" For many helped by the health law, such a prospect has focused minds and aroused fears and may account for its rising popularity, says Simon Haeder, a political science professor and specialist on health policy at West Virginia University. \"Now that we have this whole debate on replacing, repealing, repairing \u2014 whatever you want to call it \u2014 more and more of this information is coming out on what the ACA does and how it's benefited people,\" he says. ACA beneficiaries and activists flooded town halls held by Republican congressmen last week, urging them not to repeal the law. \"My story thus far has been [of] one who has benefited from the system,\" says Michael Bilodeau, 39, who attended two town halls held by California Republican Rep. Tom McClintock. \"We are able to see our local doctor, who we like. And our premiums have been, I would say, stable.\" He co-owns a small business with his wife and is on a plan from Covered California, the state's online marketplace. He fears a big change if the ACA goes away. \"One of the Republicans' major arguments is that the ACA brought disruption to people's health care,\" Bilodeau says. \"It feels like we're headed toward another disruption.\" Also, many middle- and lower-income Republicans benefit from the health law's Medicaid expansion and marketplace subsidies. That's a political hazard for Republicans who would abolish it, says Mark Peterson, a political science professor at UCLA. \"A lot of that base would be most adversely affected by repealing the ACA and replacing it with something that left enormous holes for the working class,\" he says. And while many national Republican policymakers have excoriated it, the Medicaid expansion is supported by some GOP governors. Some Republican voters object to the ACA because it's just so complex. \"It would have been better if the federal government had said, 'Look, to get these 20 million insured let's just expand Medicaid nationwide and let's leave everybody else alone,\" says Rickey Mathis, 56, a Georgian who voted for Trump and hasn't had insurance since the factory employing him closed in 2012. \"Why did they have to screw up the whole country's health insurance?\" Michigan contractor Bunkosky urges Republicans to think hard about any Obamacare replacement. \"Everybody's in a hurry for it, but they need to sit down and do it right,\" he says. \"Some of it is still a good idea.\" Kaiser Health News is an editorially independent news service that is part of the nonpartisan Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation.",

At a conference in Brussels on Thursday, more than a dozen nations and private funders pledged a combined total of $190 million for international family planning charities that stand to lose their U.S. support as a result of President Trump's Jan. 23 executive action to block U.S. foreign aid funding of groups linked to abortion. The policy disqualifies organizations that perform abortions or advocate for the procedure's legalization, as well as those that provide patients with basic information about abortion or medical referrals to obtain the procedure. \"The President, it's no secret, has made it very clear that he's a pro-life president,\" White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer told reporters shortly after the Trump action. \"And I think the reinstatement of this policy is not just something that echoes that value but respects taxpayer funding as well.\" For all its size and scope, the fundraising effort was the brainchild of one woman: Lilianne Ploumen, a Dutch government official who came up with the idea just a few weeks ago, shortly after Trump enacted the measure. The policy has been adopted by each Republican president since Ronald Reagan, and reversed by Democratic presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. Still, Ploumen says she was surprised that Trump re-instated it. \"I was very disappointed. I did have some hopes that he might decide differently,\" she says. But then, adds Ploumen, she realized that as the Netherlands' Minister of Foreign Trade and Development Cooperation, \"I was in a position to do something.\" She dubbed the replacement fund the \"She Decides Initiative\" and set about recruiting partners in other governments. Ministers of three other nations \u2014 Belgium, Denmark, and Sweden \u2014 soon signed on to co-sponsor the conference in Brussels. As a self-identified Catholic \u2014 \"I do go to church, though not every week,\" Ploumen says \u2014 she might seem an unusual champion of this cause. Several Catholic organizations are among the staunchest supporters of the U.S. funding ban, arguing that it's the only way to ensure that U.S. tax dollars don't go toward supporting abortions overseas. \"Without the Mexico City Policy in place, the U.S. is ... exporting the destruction of life as a solution to challenges faced by families in developing countries,\" Deirdre McQuade, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops told NPR shortly after Trump's election. \"Poor women in developing nations don't want help aborting their children. They're calling for food, clean water, housing, education and medicine for their families.\" Ploumen counters that her Catholic faith is actually what drives her commitment to the effort. \"We were taught that your faith helps you to develop your own conscience and to make your own decisions,\" she says. \"But in order to be able to do so you have information and you have to know what your options are, so that you can weigh them according to your values.\" And like other opponents of the funding ban, Ploumen argues it will prove counterproductive by resulting in more unwanted pregnancies and unsafe abortions. Drumming up funds for a feminist cause is a familiar role for Ploumen. From the mid-1990s through 2001 she headed an organization called Mama Cash whose mission is to raise money for groups that support women's rights. During her tenure there says, Ploumen, \"it was not so easy to get support for the movement.\" By contrast, she says, the swift response to the She Decides fund has been \"heartening.\" Among the funders that formally announced their contributions today are the governments of nine European countries, Australia, Canada and private parties such as the Gates Foundation (which is a funder of NPR). The largest single grant came from an anonymous U.S.-based donor: $50 million. Still the grand total of nearly $200 million represents less than a third of the roughly $600 million in U.S. family planning funding potentially at stake. And the amount may actually be much higher because Trump's version of the policy is more expansive \u2014 applying to spending by all global health groups and not just not just monies explicitly earmarked for family planning groups. Ploumen says she hopes not just other countries, but more non-profit groups and even individuals will step up to fill the gap in the coming weeks and months. \"This is only the beginning,\" she says. \"And governments can't do it alone.\"",

Bill and Hillary Clinton's political careers took off in Arkansas and the state capital, Little Rock, is filled with tributes to the former president, the only native of the Natural State who has made it to the Oval Office. Now a state lawmaker wants to erase the Clintons' names from the Little Rock airport. \"The state of Arkansas would just like to forget the Clinton era,\" said state Sen. Jason Rapert, a Republican. On Wednesday, the state Senate will hold a hearing about a bill Rapert has submitted that forbids the state from naming facilities built with public money after people who are still alive. The Bill and Hillary Clinton National Airport in Little Rock would be the most prominent facility affected by the proposed law. Although Bill is 16 years removed from the White House and Hillary's own presidential dreams were smashed in November, Rapert cites a familiar list of reasons why the Clintons' names should be removed from the busiest airport in Arkansas, including allegations of impropriety at the Clinton Foundation, Hillary Clinton's emails as secretary of state and Bill Clinton's impeachment by Congress. \"When people realized there really was fire where there was all that smoke with the Clintons, they really don't want to have anything to do with them at all,\" said Rapert. Shift away from Democrats A controversial figure himself, Rapert has most recently attempted to revive the abolition of same-sex marriage, criminalize abortion and install a monument to the Ten Commandments on the grounds of the state Capitol. He is on the far right in a state that has become increasingly dominated by Republicans in the past decade. By 2014, the GOP controlled the state Legislature and every constitutional office in Arkansas as white, socially conservative voters migrated away from the Democratic Party. Bill Clinton said in 2015 that he would perhaps lose in Arkansas were he running now.

Last year, Hillary Clinton didn't bother to contest Arkansas and lost the state by 27 points. After the election, a billboard on a highway leading into Little Rock read: \"The Witch is Dead. Establishment Fired. Time to drain the swamp.\" Hillary, who was raised in Illinois and educated on the East Coast, had a complicated relationship with her husband's home state. In her autobiography, Living History, she wrote, \"I was an oddity because of my dress, my Northern ways, and the use of my maiden name.\" Still, as the state's first lady, Hillary started the Home Instruction for Parents of Preschool Youngsters program, a popular early education program that continues to have bipartisan support today. Although Bill's presidential library was built in Arkansas, the couple relocated to New York after his presidency so that Hillary could pursue her own political career representing that state in the Senate. Economic legacy In 2012, while Hillary was serving as secretary of state in the Obama administration, the Little Rock airport commission voted unanimously to rename it in honor of the Clintons. \"The Clintons did a tremendous amount for this state,\" said Little Rock Mayor Mark Stodola, a Democrat. Stodola says that the Clinton presidential library has brought billions of dollars to Arkansas and that Bill Clinton remains an active presence, staying in the apartment atop the library nearly every month. Little Rock was one of the few parts of the state to back Hillary Clinton's presidential bid last year. Stodola hopes the bill won't proceed in the state Senate, but if it succeeds, the city is prepared to challenge it or reject state funding so that the law doesn't apply to the airport. Gov. Asa Hutchinson, a Republican, is staying out of the fray. Hutchinson says the decision is up to the airport commission, although he emphasized that Arkansas remains proud of the Clintons. \"Even today, I was at the mansion with some guests from a foreign country and I was, with great pride, pointing out the balcony from which Bill Clinton made one of his announcements for president,\" he said during a news conference on Tuesday. When asked whether renaming the airport pushes the boundaries of political decorum too far, Rapert conceded that perhaps the bill, which bans naming airports after a living person, should make an exception for living presidents. \"Therefore, Hillary's name would be removed,\" he said. Meanwhile, Rapert has gotten some blowback from Clinton supporters in the state. In response to his bill, a petition on Facebook proposes renaming several municipal sewage tanks after Rapert.",

Shaughnessy Naughton is the founder of 314 Action a non profit that helps scientists run for office.  MICHEL MARTIN, HOST: There's been a lot of talk about how the election of Donald Trump has sparked a new energy and engagement in politics on both the right and the left. We're going to hear now the story of a mobilization of scientists concerned that the Trump administration could upend years of work on climate change. Some scientists are worried about President Trump's Environmental Protection Agency administrator who's criticized EPA rules on climate change, clean air and water, and those concerns are prompting some scientists to move beyond just advocating for science to organizing and even running for office. One such group is called 314 Action which aims to prepare doctors, scientists, engineers and mathematicians to get more involved in politics. Its founder is Shaughnessy Naughton, a business owner with a chemistry degree who ran for Congress in Pennsylvania, albeit unsuccessfully. I began our conversation by asking her how she came up with the name 314 Action. SHAUGHNESSY NAUGHTON: Three, one, four are the first three digits of pi which is used throughout the sciences, and part of why I founded this organization was one of my observations from when I ran for Congress, I was really surprised at the lack of people with scientific or technical backgrounds. And I think we all benefit by having diversity of experience in government. And so I founded 314 Action to unite the scientific community and to encourage them to go beyond the traditional role of advocacy and actually get involved in electoral politics. MARTIN: So I understand that you called 314 Action an Emily's List for scientists, and for people who don't know, Emily's List is a group that's been around for - what? - a couple of decades now that raises money for promising democratic women candidates at all levels who favor abortion rights. Are there similar baseline positions that must be adhered to for your group to support these candidates? NAUGHTON: Well, our number-one criteria is that you have a scientific or technical background. At this point, we are only supporting Democratic candidates, and although we want to see more Republicans take action on mitigating the effects of climate change, currently the difference in the two party platforms made us feel we had to pick a team. MARTIN: Well, so I'm thinking about the fact that physicians are actually well-represented in the current administration and have been in Congress for some time. I'm thinking about President Trump's nominee for Health Secretary - Tom Price is a physician. Former Congressman Ron Paul was a physician. His son Rand Paul, the senator, was an ophthalmologist. All of them are conservatives, and I'm wondering why is that? NAUGHTON: Well, I think the nature of careers as, especially as independent practitioners for physicians, it does allow for greater flexibility and the ability to take time out of their career without being punished for it later. But what we are trying to do, although we include physicians in our umbrella group, we really want to bring people in from teaching, from research, from fields that are under-represented currently. MARTIN: Shaughnessy Naughton is a chemist, an entrepreneur, she's the founder of 314 Action. That's a group that aims to encourage scientists people from the STEM fields - science technology, engineering and math - to run for elective office. She was kind enough to join us from our member station WHYY in Philadelphia. Shaughnessy Naughton, thank you so much for speaking with us. NAUGHTON: Thank you, Michel. Copyright \u00a9 2017 NPR.

That's the backdrop for the 2017 edition of CPAC, which is the largest annual gathering of conservative activists from across the United States. It's an event that keeps growing, with attendance topping the 10,000 mark in recent years. It's four days of speeches, panel discussions, break out sessions, networking breakfasts, after-hours parties, all with plenty of patriotic music mixed in, where the rock stars are leading conservative voices \u2013 some of them elected officials, some best-selling authors or media stars, and other icons of the movement. In 2013, former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin mocked former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg's push for a soda tax. The event has its roots in a landslide defeat for conservatives \u2013 the 1964 loss of GOP presidential nominee Barry Goldwater to President Lyndon Johnson.

Less than a year later, the American Conservative Union was born with the aim of promoting conservative ideals and promoting candidates who would advance the cause. It took another decade, but by 1974 the first Conservative Political Action Conference was organized. About 400 people attended, and the headliner was California Gov. Ronald Reagan. These were hard times for conservatives. President Nixon would be forced out of office by year's end. Democrats controlled the Congress. And things would get worse before they got better. Trump is scheduled to speak at CPAC 2017 on Friday morning. In the past, he's been greeted by both cheers and wariness. CPAC attendees have always loved the way he sticks it to Democrats and the establishment. He certainly channels the opposition to political correctness that imbues CPAC. But plenty of conservatives have harbored doubts about just how much of a conservative Trump actually is. Social conservatives rallied around his pledge to nominate a Supreme Court justice in the image of Antonin Scalia, but many were slow to support Trump in 2016 due to his past support for abortion rights and same-sex marriage. Fiscal conservatives don't hear real support from Trump for small government. Additionally, his protectionist talk on international trade rankles free-market conservatives. Still, if you look at Trump's CPAC speeches, he was saying then the same things he said on the campaign trail this past year and a half. In 2011 he was a big draw, as he used his moment in the spotlight to ponder a 2012 run for the White House. In that speech Trump told the audience, \"And I can tell you this, if I run and if I win, this country will be respected again,\" as quoted in the Washington Times. And does this moment from that 2011 Trump CPAC speech sound familiar? \"If I decided to run, I will not be raising taxes, we'll be taking back hundreds of billions of dollars from other countries that are screwing us, we'll be creating vast numbers of productive jobs, and we'll rebuild our country so that we can be proud.\" In 2015, Trump returned to the conference, earning some boos when he spoke of using ground troops to combat ISIS. Then, in 2016 he was scheduled to speak but dropped out, choosing to campaign instead. It's not unusual for there to be a moment of controversy at the conference. This year's candidate for that award is the Milo Yiannapoulis invite followed by the rescinded invite after a video surfaced in which the proud and unrepentant provocateur appears to be defending the merits of pedophilia between adults and boys age 13. In past years there was columnist Ann Coulter using a homophobic slur during her 2007 speech to describe then-Democratic presidential candidate John Edwards. And in 2011 a gay Republicans group called GOProud was one of many official co-sponsors of CPAC, prompting a boycott from some other sponsors who objected to GOProud's message. A year later, GOProud's request to again be a co-sponsor was declined by CPAC organizers. One of the big news items out of CPAC is the annual presidential straw poll of attendees. The results generally reward the most conservative candidates. In 2016, Sen. Ted Cruz won, with Trump finishing a distant third. The CPAC crowd also features an active Libertarian contingent; those voters helped former congressman and presidential hopeful Ron Paul win the straw poll in 2010 and 2011, and helped his son, Sen. Rand Paul, win in 2013-2015. Ronald Reagan won CPAC straw polls in 1976, 1980 and 1984. This year, there will be no presidential preference question in the poll. A CPAC spokesman says it'll focus on issues instead. The last time there was no presidential straw poll was 2004, when President George W. Bush was still in his first term and the GOP was not in search of a presidential candidate. Here's the full list of past winners, compiled by NPR's Domenico Montanaro 1976: Ronald Reagan1980: Ronald Reagan1984: Ronald Reagan1986: Jack Kemp1987: Jack Kemp1993: Jack Kemp1995: Phil Gramm1998: Steve Forbes1999: Gary Bauer2000: George W.

Sponsors helped pay for registration fees and accommodations for these young conservatives. That helps build loyalty to the cause, and it brings these future leaders together with like-minded students from across the country. Many come from conservative colleges, but many are from campuses where their conservative views put them in opposition to many of their fellow students. Bonding happens at CPAC, along with a fair amount of late-night partying. If you go to CPAC, be sure to roam the sprawling exhibit area located on the lower level of the conference center. You'll find conservative celebrities like former congressman Col. Allen West signing books and posing for photos with fans.

Another year, a guy in a dolphin suit \u2013 who called himself Flip Romney \u2013 mocked presidential candidate Mitt Romney for being a moderate and for flip-flopping on issues such as health care. And you'll certainly see at least one attendee dressed in American Revolutionary garb, complete with a tri-cornered hat. One year a dead-on Sarah Palin impersonator stopped people in their tracks. Then there are buttons, t-shirts, beer koozies and all kinds of limited edition collectibles to be scooped up and taken home. At CPAC in 2014, even Sen.

            "article_content": "There are now more people who think Obamacare is a good idea than those who don't. It's basic human nature: People tend to get upset if they think they are about to lose something they feel entitled to or previously had. It's also the idea that fueled Donald Trump's electoral base, and ironically, now fuels those who are opposed to him.  KELLY MCEVERS, HOST: In the last couple of months, something has changed about the way Americans feel about Obamacare. Since the election, its popularity is growing. That's a big change in public opinion, and NPR political reporter Danielle Kurtzleben thinks she knows why. She's with us in the studio. Hey, there. DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN, BYLINE: Hey. MCEVERS: So tell us first about the polling on Obamacare. KURTZLEBEN: Right. So you have several polls recently - one from NBC, one from CNN. And they found that for the first time since Obamacare was passed, it is seen more favorably than not. And what's interesting is this seems to mean that even people who weren't all that crazy about Obamacare are now fighting against its repeal. Several commentators have pointed this out. And as I wrote in an article this week, one possible reason for this is the idea of relative deprivation. MCEVERS: What is that? KURTZLEBEN: So it's the sense that I'm entitled to something and that I perceive that I can't get it. Now, the idea here is that this is what inspires a lot of political revolts. There was a political scientist named Ted Robert Gurr who, in the 1970s, wrote a whole book about this. Now, the key word here is relative. This isn't just about deprivation, period. That is, I'm not necessarily going to go protest if I don't have health insurance, but I will if I think I should rightfully have it and that I can't get it. For example, in the fight over health care, you've you heard a lot of Obamacare advocates, for example, say health care is a fundamental human right. Now, to the degree that that raised people's expectations for what they should get from the government, that may be inspiring people to go out and protest right now. MCEVERS: And so when you wrote about this, you pointed to the Women's March as an example. I mean, you heard a lot of people say they had a fear of losing something, like losing access to abortion. KURTZLEBEN: Right. MCEVERS: But there were men there, too, right? Is that because they were supporters? KURTZLEBEN: Yes, right. And it's totally true. You know, you had men at these women's marches. You have a lot of people, for example, who probably won't be directly affected by the administration's executive order on immigration who are out protesting that, as well. But once again, there's a gap here between what protesters think they should have and what they are able to have. And you heard this in some of these protests where you had left-leaning protesters yelling at Democratic leaders. There's a sense there that I picked up on of we should be more powerful than this. That is, they, until recently, had something - aka the presidency - and now they've lost it. Likewise, there was this election that many had hoped and even thought they would win, and then they didn't. MCEVERS: Right. So you're seeing all this energy on the left. But you write that this idea of relative deprivation can also help explain some of the energy on the right, yeah? KURTZLEBEN: It's really striking how much Donald Trump used this in his campaign. And I would argue that this is what made him such an effective campaigner - his whole make America great again idea. He told people there's some sort of greatness they once had, they don't have it now and that he can get it back for them. MCEVERS: And as you put it, relative deprivation is basically about two things - I mean, expectations and whether or not they can be met. So what happens if expectations are not met? KURTZLEBEN: Well, we're about to see. I mean, after all, right now Trump is delivering on a lot of these campaign promises - these expectations he set up. He's signing all of these executive orders, but repealing and replacing Obamacare is a big test. Now, after all, relatively recently, he raised expectations on that. He said he would make sure there was, quote, \"insurance for everybody.\" And then he and other Republicans kind of walked that back. So what happens now is all about that gap between the expectations they set and what reality will be. So they will have to deliver or, to some degree, bring expectations down, perhaps. Otherwise, they could face some really angry voters in the future. MCEVERS: That's NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben. Thank you so much. KURTZLEBEN: Thank you.

Over the next 700-plus pages, we see the consequences of that act ripple through the doctor's family and that of his killer. The novel is called A Book of American Martyrs. Oates, who is outspoken about her liberal politics, spoke with NPR's Ari Shapiro. by Joyce Carol Oates Hardcover, 736 pages | Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How? On telling parts of the story from the perspective of the killer, Luther Luther is very sympathetic. It's a point of view that's not mine \u2014 it's not my point of view, but it's a very real point of view. Luther feels he's called; he's called by God. He doesn't want to be a murderer; he doesn't want to give up his own life. He feels he's been called by God and it's a mission. Some people may feel they're called in another way, a secular way, to be an abortion provider, to help women who are desperate, women and girls; to save them from home abortions that will kill them. ... But there are people who feel that they want to serve God and God has chosen them. So Luther feels that way. But I wouldn't say he was that unusual. What's unusual about him is that he had that determination, and you could call it courage, to follow through his convictions. ... I don't know what other word to use. He doesn't want to be the person who is called by God. Now, there are abortion provider murderers who did feel called by God. They are what we would call deluded. So Luther, we would call Luther a deluded person. I don't know, maybe put quotation marks around the word \"courage.\"  On writing the novel before Donald Trump was elected, and having it come out during his presidency When I was working on it, I remember being so immersed in that world, which of course is 1999 and 2000, early 2000. And no, I had no idea what we were moving toward. My novel deals with the sort of grassroots resentment of elite, you know, Washington people and just a kind of somehow very deep, visceral hatred of the liberal imagination, which is usually secular. So the novel is suffused with the kind of emotions that all came out in the election and really brought us to this populist demagogue, Trump.",

Senate Republicans and conservative groups quickly rallied behind President Trump's nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, as Democrats focused on lingering anger over another jurist: Merrick Garland. \"I had hoped that President Trump would work in a bipartisan way to pick a mainstream nominee like Merrick Garland and bring the country together,\" Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., a top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, said in a statement in which he pledged a \"thorough and unsparing\" confirmation process for Gorsuch. Democrats' lingering anger over Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's decision to block any consideration of President Obama's nominee to the Supreme Court almost a year ago is critical to understanding why Gorsuch's nomination is likely to play out as an angry, partisan battle over an otherwise highly regarded jurist. Another Democrat, Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon, had already announced he would filibuster Trump's nominee before it was made public. \"There is only one person in America who is a legitimate selection: Judge Merrick Garland,\" Merkley said in a fundraising appeal Monday. By late Tuesday, another four Senate Democrats had already announced they would oppose his nomination: Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Ron Wyden of Oregon, Elizabeth Warren and Ed Markey of Massachusetts. \"Before even joining the bench, he advocated to make it easier for public companies to defraud investors,\" Warren wrote on Facebook. \"As a judge, he has twisted himself into a pretzel to make sure the rules favor giant companies over workers and individual Americans. He has sided with employers who deny wages, improperly fire workers, or retaliate against whistleblowers for misconduct. He has ruled against workers in all manner of discrimination cases. And he has demonstrated hostility toward women's access to basic health care.\" Warren's opposition will help galvanize progressive activists and groups against the nomination. \"Rewarding Republicans' unprecedented obstruction of President Obama's nominee would be a total abdication of responsibility by Senate Democrats that would haunt them for the rest of their careers,\" said Murshed Zaheed, political director for CREDO, a progressive communications company. Abortion-rights groups, including EMILY's List and NARAL were also gearing up to oppose Gorsuch's nomination. Senate Democrats are already battling the Trump administration over his Cabinet picks, a factor that has amplified partisan anger on Capitol Hill less than two weeks into the new administration. \"It is time to get over the fact that they lost the election,\" McConnell said Tuesday of Democrats' delay tactics. While Democrats' can't filibuster Trump's Cabinet nominees, they can still force a 60-vote hurdle on Supreme Court nominees, and they intend to do so. Gorsuch's nomination is likely to reignite debate over the \"nuclear option\" in the Senate and whether the majority should force a rules change in the Senate to lower that threshold to 51 votes, as Democrats did in 2013 for all non-Supreme Court executive branch nominees. McConnell generally opposes invoking the nuclear option, but an unpredictable political climate awaits. For their part, Republicans are lining up behind Gorsuch, who is cast as an intellectual heir to the late conservative Justice Antonin Scalia. \"By all accounts, he has the right temperament and experience for the job,\" said Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., who argued Republicans just won the White House and maintained control of Congress in an election in which Trump campaigned specifically on nominating a conservative to the court. \"On the issue of this Supreme Court nomination specifically, the American people gave the president and the Republican-controlled Senate a mandate to choose a successor to Antonin Scalia,\" Rubio said. McConnell noted that Gorsuch's 2006 nomination to the appellate court was approved by voice vote in the Senate, and he called on senators to \"respect the result of the recent election\" and ultimately allow a vote on the nomination. Republicans have 52 votes in the Senate, and barring something unforeseen in the confirmation process, the party is likely to be unified behind Gorsuch. Senate Republicans say Gorsuch's nomination could be ready for a Senate vote by early April, citing past confirmation timelines. Democrats have already indicated they're in no rush. \"Judge Gorsuch has a long record, and it will take time to conduct a thorough review,\" said Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Dianne Feinstein of California. \"At a time when public trust in our institutions is at an all-time low and our country is bitterly divided, a thorough and fair review is vitally important.\"",

Multiple attendees said the rally was not about politics. Rather, they said, it's about one thing only. Abortion is the top voting issue for Sue Thayer, 57, who runs what she described as a \"pro-life pregnancy center\" in Storm Lake, Iowa. She's an independent, and for her, she said, the issue transcends party.

But typically that lines up with the Republican Party. I vote based on abortion.\" Another rally-goer quickly shut down NPR's questions when we asked her about her political party. (From left) Sue Thayer of Storm Lake, Iowa; Father Don Bedore from Kansas; and Mary Lou McGrath from Pawling, New York, all attended the March for Life on Friday, but came with varying view points on what they expect from Donald Trump's presidency.\n                \n                    \n                    Meg Kelly/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption \"I would rather not even talk about that,\" said Mary Lou McGrath, a 50-year-old massage therapist from Pawling, N.Y. \"I really am here because not, 'Why not?' More like, 'Why? Why wouldn't I stand for life over death?' So that's really why I'm here today.\" She added, \"It totally transcends politics. I really hate politics.\" The crowd was not entirely apolitical. Make America Great Again hats and Trump scarves and winter hats were in the mix, but finding them required some searching. Vice President Mike Pence and Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway represented the White House, addressing the rally crowd. But the attendees weren't all sold on Trump's abortion-opposition credentials. Crowds gathered along the National Mall for the 44th annual March for Life put on by abortion rights opponents from around the nation.\n                \n                    \n                    Meg Kelly/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption His past wavering on the issue made some nervous. \"I'm praying for him that it's not just a matter of expediency,\" said Father Don Bedore, a Catholic priest from Kansas. \"And the future will tell.

I support anyone who supports life. I don't know what's in Donald Trump's mind, but I know that I believe that a child in the womb is a member of the human family, and I'm going to do what I can to make other people, help them recognize that as well.\" Not that everyone in the crowd shared that kind of doubtfulness. For many abortion-rights opponents, a Trump presidency, combined with a Republican-controlled Congress and a Supreme Court that already has one opening, is an exciting prospect. \"I think it's our best chance really since Roe v. Wade to turn things around and have more of a culture for life,\" Thayer said. Trump is expected to announce his Supreme Court nominee Thursday to replace the late conservative Justice Antonin Scalia. NPR's Nina Totenberg has reported that the pick is down to three, all conservatives. For her part, Thayer knows very well that it's possible to change one's mind on abortion. She worked in a Planned Parenthood clinic before becoming an abortion-rights opponent, so when asked if Trump's positions on abortion rattled her \u2014 he once called himself \"very pro-choice\" \u2014 she empathized. \"I was pro-choice, and now I'm pro-life,\" Thayer said. \"And so no, that doesn't scare me at all.\" Hannah Millershaski, 18, wearing one of Trump's signature red hats, said she was excited about the possibility that Trump might appoint Supreme Court justices who would oppose abortion rights. Both abortion rights opponents and abortion rights supporters protest outside the Supreme Court during the 44th annual March for Life.\n                \n                    \n                    Zach Gibson/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption \"I see a great future for America with him in office,\" she said. While abortion-rights opponents are more likely to be Republican than Democratic (and advocates are more likely to be Democratic than Republican), views on the issue don't fall neatly along party lines. According to an October poll from the Pew Research Center, 62 percent of Republicans believe abortion should be illegal in all or most cases, leaving one-in-three who believe it should be legal in all or most cases. Likewise, 18 percent of Democrats believe abortion should be illegal in all or most cases \u2014 a small but by no means insignificant share. That means that some of the abortion opponents at the march didn't exactly fall in line behind all of Trump's policy choices. Father Bedore is one of them, and he worries about immigration in particular. (Left) Groups of young people travelled from around the country to listen to speakers ranging from Vice President Mike Pence to Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst ahead of the march.

They have a place,\" he said, adding that some of the immigrants he knows are in the country illegally. \"I know people who have been in the process for 15 years, 18 years, and nothing has happened. And it's not fair to them, and that's one area that I really want to see some work done.\" Likewise, those Democrats Thayer met at the hotel were represented at the march. Kristen Day, the executive director of Democrats for Life of America, attended with others from her group. Like many Democrats, she was not exactly excited about Trump's win. \"I wasn't optimistic about what he could do for the country,\" she said. A demonstrator holds up a sign that featured an American flag on one side and messaging supporting abortion rights opponents on the other.\n                \n                    \n                    Meg Kelly/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption But she still appreciates his abortion-rights opposition, and this Democrat is still hopeful on a few other issues. For example, she is still hoping that some parts of the Affordable Care Act, like allowing young adults to stay on their parents' insurance, will be maintained under a Trump presidency. In addition, she is hopeful on one women's issue in particular. \"Oddly enough, I actually have a greater hope of passing paid maternity leave under the Trump administration,\" she said, \"simply because his daughter made that a big priority. And I think we have a real opportunity there.\"",

            "article_content": "The annual March For Life is bringing anti-abortion activists from around the country to \u007fWashington, D.C., at a time when abortion opponents are looking to the Trump administration for action.  ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: Anti-abortion activists held their annual March for Life in Washington today. As NPR's Sarah McCammon reports, this year many of them are optimistic about their cause. SARAH MCCAMMON, BYLINE: As the march kicked off near the Washington Monument, the vibe was part protest, part Christian rock concert. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: (Over loudspeaker) In Jesus' name, we can't do this without you. MCCAMMON: Each year since 1974 after Roe versus Wade legalized abortion, activists have flocked to Washington to call for an end to abortion. But this year, for the first time ever, organizers say, the vice president made an in-person appearance. VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE: You know, life is winning in America. (CHEERING) PENCE: And today is a celebration of that progress, the progress that we've made in this cause. MCCAMMON: Vice President Mike Pence pledged that he and President Donald Trump will work with Congress to end taxpayer funding for abortion. In most cases federal funding for abortion is already banned under current law, but many anti-abortion activists want to block Planned Parenthood from receiving federal dollars for any women's health services. VERONICA MCDERMOTT: I don't want my money going to kill the unborn. You know, if people want to do that, they can write their own check. We should not have to pay for babies to die. MCCAMMON: Veronica McDermott came from Maryland to the march. She wore a red making America great again hat - in present tense - and a button that said defund Planned Parenthood. The organization receives about half a billion federal dollars a year to provide services like contraceptives and STDs screenings mostly through Medicaid. McDermott says she doesn't want her tax dollars paying for that, either. MCDERMOTT: The Lord says we should not have sex until marriage, first of all. MCCAMMON: For low-income women who can't afford contraception, McDermott says... MCDERMOTT: They have Obamacare. Yeah, you can go to the health clinic and get it free. We don't need Planned Parenthood. MCCAMMON: McDermott says she'd like to see more affordable care for everyone. That's something candidate Trump promised on the campaign trail when he vowed to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, though President Trump and Republican leaders in Congress have yet to outline a detailed plan. Some speakers at the March for Life also took jabs at last weekend's Women's March, whose platform was supportive of abortion rights. ERIC METAXAS: (Over loudspeaker) I have not thought a lot about blowing up Madonna's house, and the reason is because the Lord I follow commands me to love my enemies. MCCAMMON: Conservative radio host Eric Metaxas referred to Madonna, who took a lot of heat and later had to backtrack for her comment on stage at the Women's March that since Trump's election she'd thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House. METAXAS: (Over loudspeaker) Madonna, Jesus loves you, and we're going to pray that his love be revealed to you and everybody that was at the Women's March. MCCAMMON: Brian Kiernan of Charlottesville, Va. said he had friends, family members and coworkers at the Women's March, but he wanted to come to the March for Life because he opposes abortion. BRIAN KIERNAN: I certainly understand they appreciate that perspective of cherishing and defending the rights of those who are - have less or who are disadvantaged, and that's really what this march is about, too. MCCAMMON: A few groups who label themselves as pro-life feminists took part in both marches, saying they shared some goals like equal pay and ending violence against women. But whatever common ground some marchers at the two events may find, their policy goals on abortion remain sharply divided. Sarah McCammon, NPR News, Washington. Copyright \u00a9 2017 NPR.

President Trump, first lady Melania Trump, Vice President Pence and Karen Pence continued a long inaugural tradition Saturday morning, attending a prayer service that was notable for the diversity of faith participants. While most who led prayers and offered readings at the service at the Washington National Cathedral were overwhelmingly evangelical, the long list of participants also included leaders from the Catholic, Greek Orthodox, Jewish, Mormon, Muslim, Sikh, Buddhist, Bah\u00e1'\u00ed faiths. The service opened with a Navajo blessing. The inaugural prayer service is a tradition that began with President George Washington and was revived in 1933 by President Franklin Roosevelt, continuing ever since. While Trump's team had reportedly asked there be no sermon \u2014 a break with past services \u2014 the Very Reverend Randolph Marshall Hollerith, who's the dean of the Cathedral, was pointed in his prayer by asking God to \"break down the walls that separate us.\" With President Trump in attendance, Dean of Washington National Cathedral prays for God to break down walls, take away arrogance pic.twitter.com/tigM6aikbd On Friday in a pre-inaugural service at St. John's Church, First Baptist Dallas Pastor Robert Jeffress \u2014 a vocal supporter of Trump throughout his campaign \u2014 preached a sermon that compared Trump to Nehemiah, who had worked to rebuild the crumbling walls around Jerusalem, much like the border wall Trump has proposed. \"You see, God is not against building walls!\" Jeffress said. Many of the prayers at Saturday's service asked God to provide wisdom and protection for President Trump and the country. A rabbi recited a reading in Hebrew while an imam delivered a prayer in Arabic. Sajid Tarar, a Trump supporter who also prayed at the Republican National Convention, read from the Quran. Trump has stirred up opposition among both faith groups. During the campaign, he proposed a ban on Muslims coming into the country and has talked about a need for surveillance at mosques in order to stop terrorism. And Trump's support among the so-called \"alt-right\" movement of white nationalists has alarmed many in the Jewish community. Several of the songs were patriotic ones, including \"My Country 'Tis Of Thee\" and \"America the Beautiful,\" and a choir from Liberty University, whose president Jerry Falwell Jr. was also a vocal Trump supporter, sang \"We've Come This Far By Faith.\" President Trump's children and their families were also in attendance, including Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner, a new White House adviser to Trump. The couple and their children are Orthodox Jews. Notable participants included Alveda King, an anti-abortion activist who is the niece of Martin Luther King, Jr., and Cissie Graham Lynch, the granddaughter of evangelist Billy Graham whose father Franklin Graham prayed during the inauguration ceremony.

All Things Considered co-host Ari Shapiro is on a road trip leading up to the inauguration of Donald Trump on Jan. 20. He is driving through North Carolina and Virginia, on the way to Washington, D.C. These are two swing states that went in opposite directions in November, each by a close margin: North Carolina for Trump; Virginia, for Hillary Clinton. As the country faces dramatic changes, we're asking people what they want from that change \u2014 and what concerns them. From her desk in Roanoke, Va., Patrice Campbell books appointments for the 15 Planned Parenthood clinics across the region. Right after the election, she noticed a huge increase in calls, many of them asking for the same thing. \"We've seen where a lot of patients \u2014 I would say maybe 50 to 70 percent of patients \u2014 [are] eager to get in for long-term contraceptives,\" Campbell says. \"So their focus is, I need to get an IUD before Jan. 20 because an IUD can last for five, even 10 years.\" Jan. 20, of course, is Inauguration Day. Anne Logan Bass has been a clinician at this Planned Parenthood clinic for eight years. She says the election was tough for the entire staff. \"My mother actually called me, and she was asking how things were going, and I said, 'Mom it's just, we're all crying,' and she said, 'Is everyone worried they're going to lose their job?' and I said, 'No, everyone is so worried about our patients,' \" Bass says. For years, Republicans have tried to end federal funding that gets routed to Planned Parenthood, and they plan to try again after Donald Trump is in office. They object to the fact that the organization provides abortions among other health care services \u2014 even though federal funds do not cover abortion services. This clinic in Roanoke treats about 2,800 patients a year. Nationally, Planned Parenthood says it treats 2.5 million patients a year, and abortions make up 3 percent of the services. At the Sweet Donkey coffee shop in central Roanoke, Laura Rodriguez drinks tea while her 2-month-old baby girl stares wide-eyed at the world. Rodriguez describes herself as lower middle class, working as a waitress. She has no health insurance. \"I'm not a big fan of Planned Parenthood. I went there before for health issues, and they were extremely overpriced. I had to pay out of pocket, a lot of money,\" Rodriguez says. Planned Parenthood says it uses a sliding scale for fees based on a patient's annual income. Sarah Law \u2014 a registered nurse \u2014 sits in another corner of the cafe. \"I'm pretty conservative myself, and as far as abortions go, that's a different subject. But as far as women's health and Planned Parenthood, I think that does a lot of wonderful things for women that don't have the means to get proper care that they need,\" Law says. In other words, even though Law is opposed to abortions, she thinks Planned Parenthood provides important services. To her, the argument that the only way to limit abortions is to strip federal funding for Planned Parenthood \"doesn't make any sense.\" Figures released this week show that the U.S. abortion rate is at its lowest level since Roe v. Wade. And Law fears that without easy access to contraception, those numbers could go back up. As for Bass of Planned Parenthood, her hope for the next four years is to see more patients and increase access. Her greatest fear? \"That misinformation and inaccurate, unreliable information is going to continue to make our job hard.\" Use the audio link above to hear the full story.",

The numbers, in several cases, are astounding. 350.org, a climate action group, saw donations almost triple in the month after Donald Trump's election. Since Trump's win, Planned Parenthood told NPR it's gained over 600,000 new donors and more than 36,000 new volunteers. And the American Civil Liberties Union has raised more than $80 million since Nov. 8. Key players in what's being called \"The Resistance\" \u2014 a vocal and growing progressive backlash to the Trump presidency \u2014 have been flooded with, and in some cases overwhelmed by an outpouring of money and volunteer support in the last few months. In many cases, these groups are struggling to keep up. For instance, MoveOn.org, an anti-war group turned anti-Trump group, and Indivisible, a group that created a playbook for progressives to lobby members of Congress and disrupt congressional town halls, held a joint conference call the day after the Women's March on Washington in January. It was historic. \"We had 60,000 people join one conference call,\" says Anna Galland, executive director of MoveOn Civic Action. \"Guinness Book of World Records told us we broke the record for one conference call.\" (The current record for a conference call on the Guinness website is 16,972 people on a call organized by Broadnet Teleservices.) Sandra Minuitti, vice president of marketing at Charity Navigator, a watchdog group that rates charities and nonprofits, has a name for all of this new money that groups in The Resistance have been receiving: \"rage giving.\" National groups may be able to more easily adapt to all this new \"rage giving,\" but for state and local groups, some of that adjustment requires an entire reworking of an organization. Alison Beyea, the executive director of the ACLU of Maine, says that the growth in her chapter has been astronomical. Membership has already doubled \u2014 twice. And she had to make big changes. \"I have to be honest, that initially when there was endless emails about people wanting to volunteer, there certainly was a bit of apprehension,\" says Beyea. \"We haven't traditionally been an organization that has worked with volunteers.\" But the group has since adapted, and has even given those volunteers their own day, Beyea told NPR. \"We call them Team Tuesday.\" Of all the groups interviewed, the ACLU's national operation has the most clear-cut plan of how it will use all of its newfound support. Besides organizing volunteers at the state and local level, the ACLU recently organized a Resistance training called \"People Power\" for new volunteers. And a memo on the organization's website details just how its new influx of cash will be spent, with more than half the new funds being spent in key battleground states where fights are taking place over key issues important to the ACLU. The organization also joined a school for startups in Silicon Valley called Y Combinator, to figure out some best practices for spending money wisely. While having more money than you know what to do with can seem like the perfect problem, David Van Slyke, dean of the Maxwell School of Public Affairs at Syracuse University, says there is an inherent challenge: meeting the expectations of new donors and finding ways to keep them giving in the future. Some of that challenge, says Van Slyke, is remedied by specificity. \"What is it you're resisting about the president,\" says Van Slyke. \"Is it the president himself? Is it a particular executive order? A particular appointment?\" Many donors to the so-called Resistance may find themselves aligned with some of a group's aims, but not all of them. For instance, the ACLU recently defended conservative firebrand Milo Yiannapoulus and the organization in fact, does not endorse political candidates or advocate for any particular political party. Michael Cornfield, a professor of political management at George Washington University, says players in The Resistance can learn a lesson or two from the Tea Party, a group born out of resistance to America's previous president. \"One of the unusual features and I think it's a key to their success,\" Cornfeild told NPR, \"is that there was no head of the Tea Party.\" For Cornfield, a problem arises when \"you have someone or two people who think they personify the movement and their vanity creeps in.\" Cornfield also says the Tea Party succeeded by focusing locally and trying to obstruct their opponents every chance they got. But he also notes that now, as the Tea Party celebrates the Republican Party's return to power, it hasn't all been a victory lap. \"The Tea Party is part of an extremely uneasy majority coalition that controls this Congress and a lot of legislatures and statehouses,\" Cornfield said, \"and they don't know what to do next.\" As money continues to pile up for The Resistance, there's another question facing key players: how quickly should they spend it? The half dozen groups that spoke with NPR said their goal was to use it soon, and not worry too much about stockpiling for a later day. \"People give us money today, to make a difference today and tomorrow,\" said Anthony Romero, Executive Director of the ACLU. \"I think that it's really important that we put as much wood on this fire right now as we possibly can.\" For Kelly Robinson, an organizer with the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, that means collaborating as much as possible with like-minded groups. \"It is clear that if we're going to get free,\" she told NPR, \"we're all going to get free together.\" Of course, for smaller and newer organizations involved in The Resistance, behind the waves of support there is also a bit of uncertainty. Ezra Levin is one of the founders of Indivisible, the campaign to help progressives lobby their members of Congress and engage them at town halls, Tea Party style. He says some of the group's work is being figured out on the fly. Levin says Indivisible began as just a Google Doc, and when that crashed, he and his cofounders built a website, promising never to become an official organization, and only provide a guidebook for progressives that need it. Now Indivisible is a 501(c)4 nonprofit accepting donations and growing by the day. \"What we see right now is this fierce urgency,\" Levin told NPR. \"We're definitely building the plane while we fly it.\"",

            "article_content": "Progressive groups have enjoyed a fundraising bonanza since Trump's election. Whether it's the ACLU or Planned Parenthood, the cash is flowing in to organizations opposed to Trump and his policies.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Let's examine the architecture of the opposition to President Trump. Many activist groups have been preparing for a long fight. And this story begins with an epic moment that came the weekend after the president's inauguration. NPR's Sam Sanders reports. SAM SANDERS, BYLINE: Anna Galland is the executive director of moveon.org's civic action. MoveOn began as an anti-war group during the George W. Bush era. Now the group is focused on fighting Trump. ANNA GALLAND: The day after the Women's March in Washington, we held a national conference call. SANDERS: Galland says that conference call was big. GALLAND: We had 60,000 people join one conference call. The Guinness Book of World Records told us that we broke the record for the world's largest conference call. SANDERS: Sixty-thousand people on one conference call, that sounds like the conference call from hell. GALLAND: (Laughter) People stayed the whole time, too. SANDERS: There are so many other examples. 350.org, a climate action group, they told me the month after the election, they saw donations almost triple. Planned Parenthood says they've got over 600,000 new donors. And the ACLU has raised $80 million since the election. I asked Anthony Romero just how all that money is going to get spent. He's the executive director of the ACLU. ANTHONY ROMERO: First, the most important thing is we're going to build out our state infrastructure. So we've identified certain key important states with large populations, battleground states where our issues are at play. SANDERS: Romero says more than half the money will go there. Another $13 million will go to mobilize volunteers. After that, money will go to hiring a bunch of new lawyers at the national level and building new office space for them. Sandra Miniutti is with charitynavigator.org, a watchdog group that rates charities and nonprofits. She has a name for all of this new money groups like the ACLU are receiving - rage giving. SANDRA MINIUTTI: Yeah. Rage giving is something that's sort of become a new term that's popped up since the election. So people who may not like President Trump's policies then are making donations to contradict those policies. SANDERS: David Van Slyke is the dean of the Maxwell School of Public Affairs at Syracuse University. And he says the challenge with this new rage giving is keeping it going. DAVID VAN SLYKE: And what I mean by that is the organization runs the risk of new donors becoming just one-time donors. SANDERS: And for Van Slyke, a lot of that depends on how these groups meet and set donor expectations. VAN SLYKE: What is it that you're resisting about the president? Is it the president himself? Is it a particular executive order, a particular appointment? SANDERS: Michael Cornfield teaches political management at George Washington University. And he says this resistance can take a lesson or two from a protest movement just a few years old - the Tea Party. MICHAEL CORNFIELD: One of the unusual features - and I think a key to their success - of the Tea Party is that there was no head of the Tea Party. SANDERS: Cornfield also says the Tea Party succeeded by focusing locally and trying to obstruct every chance they could. Ezra Levin is one of the founders of Indivisible. Indivisible published an online guide on how to effectively lobby Congress and disrupt congressional town halls Tea Party-style. Levin spoke to me on Skype. He said Indivisible began as just a Google Doc. And then the doc crashed, so they built a website. And then the website became something more. EZRA LEVIN: We explicitly said - you can go back to it - we said, we are not professional organizers. We are not starting an organization. And then, we started an organization. SANDERS: Indivisible is now officially a 501(c)(4) nonprofit with a website and a donate button. But Ezra Levin admits Indivisible is still figuring things out. LEVIN: Yeah. So we're definitely building the plane while we fly it. SANDERS: Building the plane while they fly it. Well, wherever it goes, it may very well be a very big plane. Sam Sanders, NPR News.

Bukaty/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Supporters of Medicaid expansion celebrate their victory on Tuesday in Portland, Maine. Updated at 6:50 a.m. ET Voters in Maine have easily approved a referendum to expand Medicaid for low-income adults, doing an end-run around Republican Gov. Paul LePage, who vetoed the move \u2014 a key element of Obamacare. Maine is one of a handful of states deciding major issues by referendum on Tuesday, including New York and Ohio. Maine's Question 2 passed by about 60 percent. The measure is seen as a bellwether for continuing support of the Affordable Care Act, even as Republicans have tried repeatedly to unravel the Obama administration's signature health care bill. The vote would bring Maine, which has been hit hard by the heroin epidemic, in line with 31 other states that have expanded their state programs. An estimated 80,000 Maine residents will qualify. It is the first time such an expansion has been mandated by referendum, and as NPR's Brett Neely has written, it \"could energize organizers of similar campaigns for 2018 across the country, including in Utah and Alaska.\" Politico adds that voters hope \"to bypass state legislators hostile to the Obamacare program that sank past efforts. That dynamic has also squashed Medicaid expansion efforts in Tennessee, Wyoming and South Dakota, where GOP governors tried and failed to get legislative backing for expansion plans. In Kansas, the GOP-controlled legislature passed legislation earlier this year only to see it vetoed by Gov. Sam Brownback.\" The Portland Press Herald reports that turnout in Maine was higher than expected at the polls, with voters driven primarily by the Medicaid expansion measure, although the newspaper reports that \"voters statewide were [also] considering referendums on a casino in York County, a $102 million transportation bond and a constitutional amendment dealing with changes to state employee pensions.\" Meanwhile, voters in New York rejected a measure calling for a constitutional convention on the state's founding document. With most of the state's precincts reporting, the measure was easily defeated. The New York Times reports: \"The campaign against the constitutional convention drew a diverse collection of opponents, including conservative political groups, major labor groups like the A.F.L.-C.I.O., and liberal stalwarts like the New York branch of Planned Parenthood and the New York Civil Liberties Union. And while their concerns were often different, the basic logic of the anticonvention forces was similar: Such a convention could result in an erosion of protections for everything from collective bargaining rights to free public education.\" In Ohio, a measure to limit the price on prescription drugs purchased by the state, which was strongly opposed by the pharmaceutical industry, was defeated. The referendum called for capping what the state pays for pharmaceuticals to the same price paid by the federal Department of Veterans Affairs for the same drugs. The \"no\" vote was about 80 percent. Cleveland.com writes: \"The proponents hoped to bank on the unpopularity of the drug companies in Ohio as well as ill will toward them in general after recent price gouging controversies. The opposition backed by Big Pharma had nearly unlimited resources, outspending the Yes side by three-to-one over the course of the campaign.\"",

Jason Chaffetz speaks during a hearing on Capitol Hill in 2016. Utah Rep. Jason Chaffetz, chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, announced that he will not run for re-election in 2018 and will not seek any public office next year. Chaffetz wrote in a Facebook post on Wednesday morning, \"I am healthy. I am confident I would continue to be re-elected by large margins. I have the full support of Speaker Ryan to continue as Chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee. That said, I have made a personal decision to return to the private sector.\" As oversight chairman, Chaffetz led investigations into the Secret Service and Planned Parenthood in recent years. He has faced pressure from protesters in his home district and federal watchdogs for not pursuing investigations into the Trump administration more forcefully. Chaffetz told NPR's Morning Edition in February that his committee was concerned with possible mishandling of classified information when Trump was apparently briefed on a North Korean missile test at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida while dining with the Japanese prime minister. But Chaffetz said the idea that Trump may be profiting from his office is \"ridiculous.\" Additionally, Chaffetz said, \"The president is exempt from the conflict of interest laws. And a lot of people who for instance wanted to see his tax returns \u2014 I went on national news multiple times saying I thought Donald Trump as a candidate should have released his tax returns. But it's not required by law.\" Office of Government Ethics Director Walter Shaub Jr. spoke to NPR on Monday and called on Chaffetz to do more. The Utah Republican has \"authority to investigate these things and compel responses, so hopefully we'll see some action from him,\" Shaub said. Chaffetz faced more than 1,000 protesters at a town hall in February in his Utah district. Most of the ire was about Trump, and Chaffetz said he would not use his post as oversight chairman to go on a \"fishing expedition\" against the administration. He did send a letter to the Office of Government Ethics after White House adviser Kellyanne Conway endorsed Ivanka Trump's retail brand during a cable news interview. \"That is absolutely wrong, wrong, wrong. It is over the top,\" Chaffetz said to reporters at the time. Chaffetz has represented Utah in the House of Representatives since 2009, after he defeated incumbent Rep. Chris Cannon for the GOP nomination. Utah Republican candidates are chosen by state delegates, not through a traditional primary vote. Chaffetz proudly refused to use campaign funds to feed state delegates, as is traditional in the process of currying favor. In 2015, he launched a bid for House speaker after Rep. John Boehner resigned from Congress. Paul Ryan was eventually elected to the post after a tumultuous process. Chaffetz had previously served as chief of staff to former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman. He played on the football team at Brigham Young University, a school where he converted to both the Mormon faith and the GOP. Chaffetz was raised Jewish and had campaigned for Democrat Michael Dukakis in the 1988 presidential campaign. While Chaffetz left unclear what his future in public life might be, he could run for governor of Utah in 2020. Leaving Washington at the end of 2018 would be seen as a savvy move to spend more time in his home state, though Chaffetz has said simply he is returning to private life when his term expires next year. When he was asked about the 2020 governor's race in an interview with The Atlantic last month, Chaffetz joked he would \"definitely maybe\" run.",

Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., talks to reporters Wednesday at the U.S. Capitol. Donald Trump is still two weeks from his presidential inauguration, but new Democratic Senate leader Chuck Schumer sounds ready to do battle with a Republican-controlled Senate, House and White House. \"We're going to hold Donald Trump's feet to the fire,\" the New York Democrat told NPR's Audie Cornish on All Things Considered while sitting in front of the fireplace near his desk. \"Our job is going to be to hold Donald Trump and the Republican majority accountable.\" We're going to hold Donald Trump's feet to the fire. Our job is going to be to hold Donald Trump and the Republican majority accountable. Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y. Jan. 6, 2017 Schumer hasn't quite moved into his suite of Capitol offices. Boxes are heaped in corridors and naked hooks poke from the walls of Schumer's ornate chambers on the second floor. Just outside the windows is the inaugural podium being built and beyond it, the National Mall. Inside, amid the clutter, the new Senate minority leader is wasting no time defending Democratic policies and programs from the incoming administration and its congressional allies, even if he has less leverage than he had hoped to have. Schumer hinted at the Democrats' relatively weak position, as Republicans move quickly to repeal Obamacare. He repeatedly said Democrats would not cooperate with any Affordable Care Act replacement if the GOP pushes ahead with repeal, but then allowed that \"there might be a thing or two\" in competing Republican plans he finds appealing. He also brought negotiations into the open by putting public pressure on GOP senators from Maine and Alaska to vote against repeal. \"Now they want to eliminate the funding of Planned Parenthood,\" he said, referring to a plan by House Speaker Paul Ryan to include such provisions in legislation undoing Obamacare, \"so people like Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski are having some qualms about this.\" Schumer hinted at some of the legislative maneuvers Democrats may employ to stymie Obamacare repeal. \"We'll have an amendment on the floor of the Senate, as we debate ACA,\" he explained, \"that quotes Donald Trump and says we're opposed to cutting health care \u2014 Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security for that matter.\" I was the first & only potential GOP candidate to state there will be no cuts to Social Security, Medicare & Medicaid. Huckabee copied me. Before his intelligence briefing today, the president-elect told the New York Times that the attention devoted to Russian attempts to influence the election is \"a political witch hunt.\" Schumer called that \"flip and glib.\" \"Before you even get the briefing, you come to a conclusion \u2014 that's not the way to govern,\" he said. \"And I have said ... that we can't have a Twitter presidency. This is serious stuff, this governing, and to just be flip and glib and tweet ... you've got to do a lot more. And certainly any president \u2014 Democrat, Republican, liberal, conservative \u2014 should keep an open mind until they get the briefing.\" Schumer also responded to Trump's calling him a \"clown.\" The Democrats, lead by head clown Chuck Schumer, know how bad ObamaCare is and what a mess they are in. Instead of working to fix it, they.. \"I didn't tweet back a name \u2014 that's derogating the debate,\" Schumer said. \"I said I understand your anguish, Mr. President-elect, because you don't know what to replace the ACA with. But instead of calling names, roll up your sleeves and come up with a replacement. So I'm not going to descend to name-calling.\"",

Updated on Dec. 28 at 10:37 a.m. ET When President Trump was elected, conservatives weren't sure what they were going to get. Some were worried that he wouldn't reliably adhere to their agenda. Others were turned off by his character, the tweets, the accusations of sexual misconduct. But there were those who pulled the lever for Trump anyway, figuring he would deliver more conservative policies than a President Hillary Clinton. And deliver he has. \"Conservatives of various types have thus seen progress on their agenda in 2017,\" Ramesh Ponnuru, senior editor at National Review recently wrote. He continued: \"Economic conservatives got tax cuts and some deregulation. Legal conservatives got judicial appointments and an executive branch more mindful of the limits of its policymaking authority. Social conservatives also benefited from the judicial appointments and welcomed Trump's policy of blocking international family-planning funding from going to organizations that promote or perform abortions.\" In the end, Trump and a GOP-controlled Congress achieved \"roughly what you would expect from a Republican president with a narrowly Republican Senate and a Republican House,\" said Ponnuru. And, in fact, most of those achievements came through executive action or with the bare minimum of votes in the Senate, using arcane procedures and new interpretations of old rules to avoid filibusters. The confirmation of Justice Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, the repeal of 16 regulations through the Congressional Review Act and the tax bill that was passed through reconciliation all required just 51 votes. For someone who ran as an unconventional candidate, Trump has turned out to be a surprisingly reliable conservative as president, conventional even \u2014 aside from his social media habits, rhetoric and occasional feuding with his fellow Republicans. \"There are some areas where he disagrees with the conventional conservative view but he has either been unwilling or unable to put them into practice,\" Ponnuru said in an interview with NPR. For much of 2017, it looked as though Trump and the GOP-controlled Congress were at risk of having no major legislative accomplishments to show for the year. That changed on Dec. 20 when Trump signed a $1.5 trillion tax cut bill, which also knocked out the Affordable Care Act's penalty for not having insurance and opened up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling. The Tax Cut/Reform Bill, including Massive Alaska Drilling and the Repeal of the highly unpopular Individual Mandate, brought it all together as to what an incredible year we had. Don\u2019t let the Fake News convince you otherwise...and our insider Polls are strong! A couple of days after signing the bill, Trump was still celebrating how the tax plan \"brought it all together as to what an incredible year we had.\" \"Incredible\" may not be the adjective of choice for Democrats, but they do acknowledge Trump's achievements during year one on the job. \"It depends on how you define success, but he has definitely accomplished some key goals of the conservative movement,\" said Neera Tanden, president of the Center for American Progress, a group that has been fighting Trump's agenda at every turn. \"I expected Donald Trump to pursue a far right agenda and he is meeting those expectations and he is succeeding.\" But, as Tanden sees it, Trump's success is coming at a cost. The left is highly energized, and his approval rating is south of 40 percent. \"He will reshape American life in fundamental ways, particularly in the regulatory code and what he's done on taxes, but I think where he has failed is to bring the American people with him,\" said Tanden. It seems bringing the American people along may not have really been the goal. For Trump, it's all about the base. And there's a risk that laser focus will have consequences. It probably already has, if you look at Democratic turnout in recent off-year elections. The Fake News refuses to talk about how Big and how Strong our BASE is. They show Fake Polls just like they report Fake News. Despite only negative reporting, we are doing well - nobody is going to beat us. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! \"The Trump administration has now delivered a tax cut that makes conservatives happy,\" Ponnuru said. \"It hasn't really done a lot to make swing voters happy. But it also hasn't really tried.\" Trump says that effort is coming in 2018, with what he hopes will be bipartisan infrastructure legislation. It will be easy, he recently argued. Democrats, whose votes would be needed, aren't so sure. As for 2017, Ponnuru says another Republican president probably would have done more to shape the tax bill than Trump did, and may have come in with a fleshed-out proposal for repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act. The inability to repeal former President Barack Obama's signature accomplishment was by far the greatest failure of Trump's first year. Despite Trump's claims to the contrary, Obamacare is still the law of the land. But would that have been different with a different Republican president? Ponnuru isn't so sure. By Trump's own account, he has been off-the-charts incredibly successful. The Stock Market is setting record after record and unemployment is at a 17 year low. So many things accomplished by the Trump Administration, perhaps more than any other President in first year. Sadly, will never be reported correctly by the Fake News Media! At a recent White House press briefing, it took press secretary Sarah Sanders a full 2 1/2 minutes to list all of what Trump had overseen since his inauguration. Her list included: It was, Sanders said, \"by any measure, a historic year.\"",

When Donald Trump announced he would be running for president, he didn't seem like the obvious candidate for evangelical voters, given his multiple divorces, use of crass language and one-time admission that he had never asked God for forgiveness. Nonetheless, he did manage to coalesce 81 percent of white evangelical voters behind him in November. Almost a year since Election Day, President Trump's unlikely marriage with the religious right seems to have only strengthened, as seen at the Values Voter Summit earlier this month. Trump administration officials peppered the speaker list, and attendees praised the president as having been chosen by God to lead the country at this time. God, Anger, Hope, and Why Christian Conservatives Supported Him by Stephen Mansfield Hardcover, 195 pages | Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How? As author Stephen Mansfield details in his new book, Choosing Donald Trump: God, Anger, Hope, and Why Christian Conservatives Supported Him, Trump was able to tap into resentment within the parts of the evangelical community that boiled over during former President Barack Obama's tenure. They feared that religious freedom was under assault as a result of actions like the administration's birth control mandate and protections for LGBT people. \"Fear, anger \u2014 both of those played a huge role,\" Mansfield told NPR. \"And Donald Trump definitely seemed to be the champion of those two dynamics, those two emotions.\" According to Mansfield \u2014 who has written about the faith of former Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama \u2014 Trump spoke evangelicals' language on many issues. Trump promised to repeal the Johnson Amendment, which regulates political speech from the pulpit, and pledged to nominate a conservative Supreme Court justice to the bench, which he did in Neil Gorsuch. And many prominent faith leaders \u2014 including Liberty University's Jerry Falwell Jr. and First Baptist Dallas' Robert Jeffress \u2014 didn't just endorse Trump, they gave him their most full-throated blessing and defense. But that fervent support from evangelicals may have come at a cost, Mansfield argues, as they overlooked actions that could be taken as antithetical to their faith, including comments about women and race. There have been growing racial and generational divisions within the church, Mansfield says, and Trump's election seems to have brought some of those simmering tensions to the surface, putting evangelicalism at a potential crossroads. Yet many evangelicals maintain fierce support. At the Values Voter Summit, for example, conservative commentator Bill Bennett noted: \"We are conscious of his history. We are conscious of his future. And as Oscar Wilde said, 'Just as every sinner has a future, every saint has a past.' \" Yet a younger, more diverse generation of evangelicals appears skeptical. Mansfield recently talked to NPR about his book, Trump's history with religion, lessons learned from the 2016 election and what Trump's presidency has meant for evangelicals. The interview excerpts below have been edited for length and clarity. Do you think that the number of evangelicals and evangelical leaders that have backed Trump has done harm to their witness? I think it has, yes. I think that they are especially going to lose influence amongst millennials, who are strongly social justice-oriented, and the surveys indicate that the vast majority of them are very suspicious of Donald Trump. You've got an unusual situation here where the leaders of the religious right are not only having to account to a watching world for why they compromised their religious message to support Donald Trump, but you also are going to have some blowback from the very people that the religious right is trying to reach. The very people these pastors are trying to reach \u2014 the young, people of color, etc. \u2014 I think they may have lost them and, in some cases, permanently. We saw a stark difference between how white and black evangelicals voted. How much do you think Trump's selection widened the racial chasm in the church and made racial reconciliation even even harder? I think it has exacerbated the problem tremendously. One of the points I make in the book is that a pastor or religious leader can endorse Donald Trump but not have to, as we say in our crass phrase, get in bed with him or become part of his PR team. But a lot of those public leaders were very outspoken for him. Never did we hear anyone say publicly, \"Sir, you're making racist statements, sir, when you say that a Mexican judge can't rule justly in a case involving you, you know, you've crossed the line.\" Never did we hear those religious conservatives who supported him speak out about these race issues. We didn't see them marching in Ferguson; we didn't see them meeting with the leaders of Black Lives Matter. So there they did exacerbate a racial chasm, whether they intended to or not. I think we're going to be paying for that for quite some time. Has this election exposed a generational divide among Christians? It has. In the end, the word that is used most often when I talk to the young is \"hypocrisy.\" They sat in their churches, and they heard certain conduct described as wrong. Yet when Donald Trump did it, or when it was reported on a video, we heard kind of a \"boys will be boys\" sort of response even from very, very prominent religious leaders. They began to wonder if the message they had been hearing all those years in church was consistent with the people they had respected. In the end the word that is used most often when I talk to the young is 'hypocrisy.' Author Stephen Mansfield It's really thrown a lot of them into real turmoil, and I think as a result we're going to see the number of \"religious nones\" increase, because many of them will continue to be religious, continue to be believers in God. But they are losing confidence in the church they were once part of, and in some cases, that's a direct result of what happened in that election. You explore the Johnson Amendment and the history of it in the book and why Trump seized upon promising to abolish it.  Why do you think that was what was so effective? I think it was effective because it was almost like code language in a sense. I'm not really frankly sure that the average pastor, a religiously conservative pastor, thinks daily about the Johnson Amendment and can't wait until it's abolished. But I think those listening sessions that [televangelist] Paula White scripted for Donald Trump, Donald Trump did hear about the Johnson Amendment, it was something he could do. And so as he began talking about it, he realized that it echoed with a lot of religious conservatives and at least said, \"I'm concerned about your issues. I want to try to liberate your pulpit. I want to allow you to speak in spiritual terms about politics.\" This was something that they had heard the opposite of from the Obama administration, and so it signaled more than it was really worth in political capital. You write a lot about the influence that Trump's pastor Norman Vincent Peale had on him and Peale's book, The Power of Positive Thinking, which was quite controversial at the time. Peale seems to have almost been a precursor to the prosperity gospel, which Trump seems to have aligned himself with the most, along with people like Paula White. Norman Vincent Peale himself said, \"I believe personally in the 'born again gospel,' but I talk about that in my church. Publicly, though, and in meetings around the country around the world, I talk more of a motivational kind of message.\" And that's, I believe, the message that Donald Trump really drank from. I think that's the one that really shaped him. For example, not only \"the power of positive thinking\" was one of Norman Vincent Peale's phrases, but he also would go around saying, \"Attitude is more important than facts.\" Well, if there's anything that we see with Donald Trump, it's that he believes that attitude, bravado. This is straight from Norman Vincent Peale. So I don't think he absorbed the message of transformation through Christ that Norman Vincent Peale believed but didn't proclaim very publicly. It seems like the conclusion that you draw in the book is that evangelical Christianity is in a state of crisis right now. Has that been exacerbated by Trump, and where can they go from there? Yeah, it has been exacerbated, and they are in crisis. And I think there's a lot of healing that that needs to happen. I mean, I know of large families that have met for Thanksgiving dinner and didn't meet this last Thanksgiving, and the dividing issue that brought strife was the Trump presidency. I know churches where there have been splits. I know of tension on church staffs. There's a great deal of turmoil, and evangelicalism as a whole is in flux, and a lot of it has to do with politics. I know many people who are saying, \"I'm not sure I'm staying in the church that I've been attending because it's become so political.\" I have heard that phrase probably two dozen times. So evangelicalism as an approach to Jesus and an approach to wanting to convert the world is fairly solid, but evangelicalism as a political movement is definitely in crisis. Author Stephen Mansfield So evangelicalism as an approach to Jesus and an approach to wanting to convert the world is fairly solid, but evangelicalism as a political movement is definitely in crisis. I think it's caused a lot of people to rethink what they're doing, what they're connected to, what kind of church they want to be in. And I think that's going to continue for quite a while. It's a tragedy. In fact, if you say the word evangelical to those outside of evangelicalism, they assume it's a political movement, and that's part of the problem. They don't know that it's more because that hasn't been the public face of evangelicalism.",

America is losing the battle against sexually transmitted infections. Cases of chlamydia, gonorrhea and syphilis all hit record-high numbers in 2015. Tens of thousands contract HIV every year in the U.S., and oral cancers caused by human papillomavirus are increasing. So startups are popping up online to help serve what they see as unmet demand for STD testing. One advertises that you can \"get a sexy deal\" by ordering. The question is whether those companies can survive \u2014 at least one left the market before its product even launched \u2014 and whether the services they offer get the right tests to the right people. Although encouraging people to get tested is a simple enough public health message, that doesn't mean it's simple to carry out, says Kevin Ault, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Kansas Medical Center in Kansas City, Kan. \"You have to make the appointment at the doctor's office, drive to the doctor's office, give the sample to the doctor, the doctor sends it to the lab, you wait for the results to come back, and then you wait for the doctor to call you,\" Ault says. And the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that people in some at-risk groups do all that several times a year. \"The biggest advantage of home tests in general is if you catch HIV or chlamydia early on, you can change the natural course of the disease,\" Ault says. Few options exist to make the process easier. So far, there is just one test approved that gives rapid results in the home, and it's for HIV. The startups are hoping that being able to collect samples at home will be enough to encourage people to get tested. \"The concept of providing the possibility of a self-sampling approach to test for STDs is really going to be our future in terms of diagnostic testing,\" says Jennifer Smith, an associate professor of epidemiology at the University of North Carolina Gillings School of Global Public Health in Chapel Hill. Hill also consults for myLAB Box, one of companies offering these services. \"Getting the actual test to the patient is going to be a way of not only increasing access and improving acceptability, but also cutting down on unnecessary medical visits,\" Smith says. Big increases in people infected with STDs A sobering report from the CDC last October revealed just how much new approaches are needed to combat increasing infection rates. More than 1.5 million people contracted chlamydia in 2015, an increase of 5.9 percent from the year before. Similarly, gonorrhea cases jumped 12.8 percent to almost 400,000 cases. The nearly 24,000 new cases of primary and secondary syphilis (the two most infectious disease stages) represented a 19 percent increase. Aside from early symptoms that several STDs can cause \u2014 such as painful urination, discharge, bleeding, swelling or pain \u2014 long-term symptoms in people who don't receive treatment can be serious. Untreated gonorrhea, for example, can cause infertility and long-term pelvic or abdominal pain in men and women as well as ectopic pregnancies, which can be fatal. If syphilis is not treated, it can damage the brain, eyes and nervous system, potentially resulting in severe headaches, poor muscle coordination, paralysis, numbness, dementia or blindness. In rare cases, syphilis can cause death 10 to 30 years after infection. STDs also have downstream consequences for the next generation. Cases of congenital syphilis, which can cause severe illness and stillbirth, has increased in newborns 38 percent from 2012 to 2014, according to the CDC, even though women don't even represent 10 percent of new infections overall. New HIV infections have been steadily dropping, but 2015 still saw more than 39,500 new cases. And although HPV, the most commonly transmitted STD, resolves on its own in most people, it still causes about 31,500 new cancers annually. \"When something affects millions of people, even a low rate of serious outcomes translates to a lot of people,\" says H. Hunter Handsfield, a professor emeritus at the University of Washington. Handsfield, currently a scientific adviser to the American Sexual Health Association, spent a quarter of a century directing the STD control program for Seattle's public health department and now consults for the CDC. \"We have an ongoing and important public health problem of people getting HIV and getting cervical and other HPV-related cancers. The numbers of those actual cancers are small, but that's a big deal for each of those people.\" Startups See An Opportunity The idea of online STD testing isn't new, but most services so far have been localized, limited in test options or still require visiting a lab or pharmacy. For example, residents of Maryland, Washington, D.C., and Alaska can request kits to be mailed to them with self-collection instructions and materials for genital and/or rectal swabs, but only for gonorrhea, chlamydia and trichomoniasis. Planned Parenthood has begun offering similar services but only for gonorrhea and chlamydia and only in Idaho, Minnesota and Washington. More than a dozen commercial companies nationally let consumers order STD testing kits online for other infections, but buyers still have to visit a local lab for sample collection. The online businesses aim to offer many more tests without customers needing to go anywhere except the mailbox. The two business models are subscription-based or one-off orders: Consumers order the test, receive it in the mail, collect their own blood, urine, genital and/or rectal samples, mail samples back in a prepaid envelope and then wait until results are available to check online. One company, GetTested, still has a live website but has ceased operation, according to a spokesperson. Another, Mately, doesn't appear operational and did not respond to multiple attempts to request an interview. That leaves myLAB box, which has been tweaking its services and procedures since its launch in December 2013 as executives learn what does and doesn't work. The CDC generally supports the idea of at-home STD testing, according to John Papp, a microbiologist in the CDC's Division of STD Prevention and author of CDC's lab testing recommendations for gonorrhea and chlamydia. \"From our perspective in public health, we want people to have access,\" Papp says. \"The concept of greater access, however that looks, if it's by a website or a van down by the river, is always a good thing. But the regulatory piece needs to be adhered to.\" But little regulation exists for online, at-home STD testing. The labs where tests are performed should meet the standards of the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments, and the tests themselves should be FDA-approved when available. The tests offered by myLAB Box meet both those requirements. \"There's no FDA indication for at-home collection and sending it into a laboratory,\" Papp says. \"Having said that, if the specimen is collected properly, regardless of the setting, the test is probably being performed adequately.\" Most of the tests detect some piece of the organism itself. Three others, for hepatitis C, syphilis and herpes simplex type II, test for the body's antibodies made in response to the infection. The HIV test looks for both the virus and antibodies. The tests have been shown to work even with samples exposed to extreme temperatures, so having a blood spot and urine sample sitting in a Florida mailbox in August shouldn't affect results, Handsfield says. Reaching the right people But Handsfield says online tests don't reach the people who need testing and treatment the most. \"It's a good idea, with a giant caveat that it reaches the wrong people,\" Handsfield says about online services. \"The highest infection rates are in people with lesser education or lower income, in inner cities or the rural kid in a red state immersed in a methamphetamine world.\" He would like to see public health departments partner with online sites and subsidize the cost to promote home self-testing for a broader population of high-risk, lower-income people. The CDC's October report, for example, showed that 15- to 24-year-olds make up half of gonorrhea cases and almost two-thirds of all chlamydia ones. \"These are not the same people who are paying money to buy tests online,\" Handsfield says. MyLAB Box offers three pricing tiers: the \"Safe Box\" for $189 (HIV, chlamydia, gonorrhea and trichomoniasis); the \"Uber Box\" for $269 (adds hepatitis C, herpes simplex type II and syphilis); and the \"Total Box\" for $399 (adds HPV, Mycoplasma genitalium and ureaplasma plus rectal and throat testing for chlamydia and gonorrhea). Each test can also be purchased individually for $79. But Gary Richwald, myLAB Box's medical director and chief scientific officer, says the company is reaching the right people. He says their rates of positive tests are on par with or higher than what he saw when he ran STD clinics for Los Angeles County, the largest such program in the U.S., from 1989 to 2000. For example, 7.3 percent of myLAB Box clients' tests for chlamydia were positive in February. Community rates at L.A. clinics two decades ago, where the population would presumably have been high risk, ranged from 4 percent to 5 percent, Richwald says, with family planning clinic rates lagging just behind that. \"The data show in every study that people who voluntarily go somewhere to be tested have higher rates than the general population who might be tested door to door,\" Richwald says. And yet \"the vast majority of people with STDs never get tested, and they are the principal source of new infections.\" Richwald describes the company's customer base as people mostly in their mid- to late 20s, with many in their 30s and 40s as well, and often at a transitional stage in their life, such as having recently ended a relationship or gotten divorced. Economically, they seem to hover between lower middle class and middle upper class, he says. Customers include residents of areas with doctor shortages, where getting tested requires going to urgent care or the ER; single mothers without time to get to a clinic or doctor's office; and individuals with previous unsatisfactory health care experiences. They also tend to have three other characteristics: comfort and familiarity with using the Internet, a desire for convenience \u2014 \"I can't tell you how many people said they collected their specimen after midnight,\" Richwald says \u2014 and concerns about privacy. \"With this election and general concerns about privacy in this country, people are afraid that even their request for a test, much less their positive, would end up in some place that collects health-related information,\" Richwald says. A number of customers include those in the health care field themselves, he says, such as physicians, dentists and nurse practitioners. Choosing the right tests One big question is what to test for. Public health clinics generally offer free testing of gonorrhea, chlamydia, syphilis and HIV, with some offering various additional tests, such as trichomoniasis, HPV or herpes type II. Few public health clinics test for ureaplasma, hepatitis C or Mycoplasma genitalium. A person's first instinct may be to test for \"everything,\" especially if they have a sexual history or recent sexual experience that could be a concern. But not everybody should be tested for every infection. Hepatitis C, for example, is currently among the tests offered by myLAB Box, but it's not considered a sexually transmitted disease for anyone other than men with HIV who have sex with men, Handsfield says. (All individuals born between 1945 and '65 are recommended to be tested once for hepatitis C, however.) And men are not typically tested for HPV because no treatment exists for the infection, and it's unclear what to do with a positive result. MyLAB Box company co-founder Lora Ivanova says the company trusts the consumer to do the homework on what tests to order. \"Our role is to make it as easy as possible for the person who has decided to get tested to get the test they want,\" Ivanova says. \"For a long time, consumers have been limited to the tests they can take based on the medial debate. We're taking the position that the consumers ultimately have the right to know. We don't see why we as providers should limit their access to care.\" But if doctors and public health policymakers cannot agree on who should be tested for infections like Mycoplasma genitalium and ureaplasma, Handsfield says, then how would a consumer make that decision? \"The issue of who to test and what tests to do continues to be a question that's very important but does not have an exact answer,\" Richwald acknowledges. That's partly why he was brought on, and Ivanova did say the company's system \"is in constant flux\" based on \"recommendations and available data.\" The company doesn't offer testing for herpes simplex type I, for example, because 60 percent to 70 percent of individuals already have antibodies, acquired non-sexually in childhood. Richwald also says the company isn't testing for ureaplasma anymore, but the test still appears on the company website. Mycoplasma genitalium presents a conundrum as well. First, no FDA-approved diagnostic test for the bacteria exists. Experts disagree on how to interpret positive results, Handsfield says. It's a common bacteria found in about 1 percent of the population, but most people don't have symptoms. Treatment is challenging and not recommended for infections without symptoms. But for those with symptoms \u2014 vaginal pain or itching, discharge from the urethra, painful urination and painful or swelling joints \u2014 treatment can prevent pelvic inflammatory disease or worsening symptoms, Richwald says. Another consideration people must weigh is when to test, because incubation periods vary by disease. If someone has been regularly sexually active, especially without using a condom, and has not been tested in the six months, timing is less relevant. But if someone is testing after a specific encounter, some infections, such as HIV, cannot be detected immediately. \"Often people get tested too soon, such as a week after exposure,\" Handsfield says. Chlamydia and gonorrhea can usually be detected after several days (a week on the conservative side), but herpes and one HIV test require up to three months of delay before testing. A chart on the myLAB Box site provides time frames for testing and, when necessary, retesting. It recommends that people wait until the end of the time frames listed before testing unless the person plans to retest. The ideal testing window for Mycoplasma genitalium, however, is unknown, Handsfield says. \"For the panel as a whole, I would say wait three months if you have no symptoms,\" Handsfield says. \"If you have symptoms \u2014 if you're having urethral discharge, unexplained vaginal discharge, abdominal pain \u2014 online testing is not for you. You need to see a doctor.\" Handling positive tests, whether true or false positives, also requires careful consideration. The newest syphilis tests, for example, are known for giving a lot of false positives, Handsfield says, and that can lead to increased anxiety between a first test and a retest, although the same concern would exist at a community clinic. At myLAB Box, Richwald personally calls all customers with a positive HIV result and ensures they get an appointment with an HIV specialist group. Immediate treatment can dramatically reduce their infectiousness while improving their health, he says. A positive result for syphilis requires confirmation at a clinic in person, and someone with chlamydia and symptoms of pelvic pain, for example, would be told to go to a clinic or urgent care. MyLAB Box regularly reviews new research to inform their decisions, but it remains a tricky line to walk: making tests widely available to the public while trying to guide them toward the best tests for their situation without driving them away. \"There's a lot of fear, hesitation and confusion, and I think what it has ultimately done is turn people to the point where they're sweeping it under the rug,\" Ivanova says. \"At the end of the day, it's about getting the person to get tested. If we lose that one single time in a year or in two or five years that they have mustered the courage to get online and get the tests, they might spend the next five years infecting every partner they have.\" Tara Haelle is the co-author of The Informed Parent: A Science-Based Resource for Your Child's First Four Years.

In a moment of unexpected high drama, Republicans were stymied once again in their effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act \u2014 and they have John McCain to thank for it. In the early morning hours Friday, the senator showed why he earned the nickname \"Maverick\" over his long tenure. McCain, who was diagnosed with brain cancer and returned to Washington to advance the health care bill, turned around and bucked his party's leadership \u2014 and President Trump \u2014 by joining two moderate Republicans, two independents and every Democrat in voting against the so-called \"skinny repeal\" of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. McCain's office released a statement from the senator on his reasoning: \"From the beginning, I have believed that Obamacare should be repealed and replaced with a solution that increases competition, lowers costs, and improves care for the American people. The so-called 'skinny repeal' amendment the Senate voted on today would not accomplish those goals. While the amendment would have repealed some of Obamacare's most burdensome regulations, it offered no replacement to actually reform our health care system and deliver affordable, quality health care to our citizens. The Speaker's statement that the House would be 'willing' to go to conference does not ease my concern that this shell of a bill could be taken up and passed at any time.\" McCain continued, calling on lawmakers to \"return to the correct way of legislating and send the bill back to committee, hold hearings, receive input from both sides of aisle, heed the recommendations of nation's governors, and produce a bill that finally delivers affordable health care for the American people.\" The Senate voted 51-49 against the legislation aimed at dismantling the Affordable Care Act. \"This is clearly a disappointing moment,\" Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said immediately after the bill failed. He added, \"I regret that our efforts simply were not enough this time.\" McConnell, who seemed to exhaust every trick in the procedural playbook to get to this point, seemed surprised and undercut by the result. The defeat ends \u2014 for now \u2014 the health care debate in Congress. The chamber adjourned following the defeat, and there are no further Senate votes this week. In the short term, the Senate intends to move on to defense legislation and the nomination of Christopher Wray to be the next FBI director. In a written statement from McConnell's office after the vote, he seemed to indicate a GOP-only effort on health care may be dead. \"We look forward to our colleagues on the other side suggesting what they have in mind,\" McConnell said in the statement. Republican senators said there was no consensus and no plan for what comes next on health care. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, warned of potentially severe political consequences for Republicans for failing to deliver on what has been the GOP's unifying campaign pledge for the previous three elections. \"I sadly feel a great many Americans will feel betrayed,\" Cruz told reporters, \"that they were lied to, and that sentiment will not be unjustified.\" The \"skinny repeal\" was a pared-down version of Republican proposals to undo Obamacare with no plan for what to replace it with. It would have eliminated the individual and employer mandate and key taxes, defunded Planned Parenthood for a year and eliminated key protections of health benefits that were required under Obamacare. The bill was deeply unpopular, but GOP leaders worked to assure members it would never become law. Instead, they wanted the Senate to pass it in order to advance the legislation to a third round of negotiations with the House to try to craft a final bill both chambers could pass. McCain was not moved by these assurances, including a private meeting with House Speaker Paul Ryan on Thursday prior to the Senate vote. After the vote, McCain quickly left the Capitol and declined to comment to reporters. Something seemed afoot before the vote. It was delayed. McCain was seen huddling with Democrats. Vice President Pence, who had come to the Capitol expecting to be the tiebreaking vote, personally \u2014 and unsuccessfully \u2014 lobbied McCain on the floor to try to win his vote. With McCain's vote apparently gone, Republicans were seen trying to persuade Alaska's Lisa Murkowski to vote for the bill \u2014 to no avail. She eventually also voted no (as originally expected) along with Maine's Susan Collins. Some GOP senators worried the measure would go back to the House, where leaders would put it on the floor, pass it and send it to Trump \u2014 who has said he would sign whatever lands on his desk when it comes to Republican-passed health care legislation. Before the vote, at 10:43 p.m. ET, Trump was rooting them on in a tweet: \"Go Republican Senators. Go!\" Go Republican Senators, Go! Get there after waiting for 7 years. Give America great healthcare! Afterward, it was a different story, with the president tweeting at 2:25 a.m. ET that those who voted no had \"let the American people down.\" 3 Republicans and 48 Democrats let the American people down. As I said from the beginning, let ObamaCare implode, then deal. Watch! It's somewhat ironic that McCain was the one to derail what seemed like a sure Trump victory (even if only a short-term one). After all, Trump's comments about the former prisoner of war were among the earliest to land the then-candidate in controversy. \"He's not a war hero,\" Trump said in 2015 of McCain. \"He was a war hero, because he was captured. I like people who weren't captured. He's been losing so long he doesn't know how to win anymore.\" That was likely never lost on McCain.",

When senators come back to Washington on Monday, a handful of Republicans will help decide the fate of legislation that could reshape health care in America. One of them is Nevada Republican Dean Heller. Sen. Heller is one of a small bunch of Republicans who have said they will not support the latest draft proposal to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare. Republican leadership can only lose the support of two of its own senators and still pass such a bill. The Republican senators who say they'll vote no on the latest health care plan fall into two camps. Members of the party's right wing think this proposal is too timid and doesn't go far enough to undo the Affordable Care Act. More moderate Republicans, like Heller, think it is harsh and goes too far. \"I'm telling you right now, I cannot support a piece of legislation that takes away insurance away from tens of millions of Americans and hundreds of thousands of Nevadans,\" he said. Nevada's popular governor, Brian Sandoval, was the first Republican governor in the country to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. More than 200,000 uninsured people got coverage after the expansion. With that expansion of coverage, many people here are watching the fate of this bill to learn whether they'll be able to keep going to the doctor. Heller's position has prompted advocacy groups and constituents on both sides of the issue to flood his office with calls. For weeks, protesters have been showing up outside the senator's Las Vegas office urging him to oppose any changes to the health care system that would roll back provisions like the Medicaid expansion or funding for Planned Parenthood.

For people on both sides of this debate, the stakes seem far higher than a typical piece of legislation. People like Taylor feel that what has been proposed puts their lives on the line; Republicans who support the bill see a chance for lawmakers like Heller to keep a promise that Republicans have made in every campaign for nearly a decade. Conservative talk radio host Wayne Allyn Root says nearly every caller now talks about voting Heller out of office because of his opposition to the draft proposal that Republicans floated in recent weeks. \"If Heller votes no on the repeal he's got to go, you gotta primary him,\" he says. Root broadcasts out of his home studio for three hours each day. He has piles of framed photographs, including images of him with President Trump, Newt Gingrich and Ronald Reagan. Root says his listeners are aghast that a Republican senator from their own state could be responsible for helping to kill this bill.

National groups on both sides have put millions of dollars into TV ads trying to sway Heller. The senator is home for the July Fourth recess this week, but he isn't spending that time holding town halls. In the small town of Ely, he rode a horse in the July Fourth parade. He watched the fireworks in Elko, another town in rural northern Nevada. Even there, some people heckled him. Heller declined the Republican Party's invitation to march in the town of Pahrump, which has the same spectrum of Republican views that's dividing the Senate. Local party chairman Joe Burdzinski thinks the bill is too timid. He'd stand with senators like Rand Paul and Ted Cruz, holding out for a full repeal. \"The Republican Party has said for the last eight years we're gonna repeal and get rid of Obamacare. That's what Donald Trump said he wanted to do, that's what other Republicans running for office have said. Now they have to live up to that commitment to the American people because ... the American people voted for that,\" he says.

Quit mickey-mousing around and get some work done.\" For Heller, the considerations about Medicaid expansion and repeal promises might all take a back seat to a more pressing reality. He's up for re-election next year \u2014 a Republican in a state that has gone blue for the last three presidential elections. Whatever position he takes on the final bill, that race will be far from an easy win.",

            "article_content": "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has been answering questions about the Senate health care bill ever since it was released.\n                \n                    \n                    Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has been answering questions about the Senate health care bill ever since it was released. One provision of the Senate's health care bill stands to be quite popular: the Better Care Reconciliation Act would eliminate the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate. That would be repealed immediately. Another would likely please the Republican base: defunding Planned Parenthood for a year. Those funds would disappear right away, too. Another would threaten health care coverage for millions of Americans: a rollback to the Medicaid expansion. That change wouldn't start until 2021. Repealing Obamacare may be Senate Republicans' main goal, but it's also easy to see how the BCRA could benefit the GOP in coming elections. The provisions that stand to be more popular (and less harmful to many Americans) are front-loaded, occurring before the 2018 midterms. Cuts to premium subsidies and Medicaid come after that, and many of them are delayed until after the 2020 presidential election. To better see how this bill could affect future politics, we've put together a timeline of when major BCRA changes would go into effect in relation to the dates of coming elections. We've also explained the potential effects of the bill, as reported by the Congressional Budget Office and other health care experts, to try to game out how those effects could affect voters' choices. (And to be clear, any number of factors influence people's voting choices, so this is by no means a prediction of election winners and losers.) So here's what goes into effect when: Prior to this point, the individual mandate \u2014 one of the most unpopular parts (maybe the most unpopular part) of Obamacare \u2014 will have been repealed. That could make midterm voters happy \u2014 and inclined to vote for Republicans \u2014 despite the fact that Obamacare has, in general, gained in popularity since Trump took office. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the elimination of the individual mandate would lead to 15 million more uninsured people in 2018 alone. In addition, several Obamacare taxes will have been repealed by now, overwhelmingly benefiting the highest-income Americans. Those changes could please a crucial group of GOP supporters. Not only that, but the bill will not have yet removed cost-sharing subsidies \u2014 payments to insurers that help lower-income customers afford coverage \u2014 and it will not have yet kicked in the (generally) less-generous premium support subsidies. The Medicaid expansion likewise will not have yet been rolled back. That rollback will eventually affect millions \u2014 by 2026, it would mean 15 million more people would be off the Medicaid rolls than there would be under current law, according to the CBO. In short, many of the potentially less-popular provisions of this law \u2014 provisions that would lead to higher premiums or deductibles (which could in turn lead to more people choosing not to buy coverage), as well as lower Medicaid enrollment \u2014 wouldn't go into effect for a while and could save the GOP some pain at the ballot box. However, it could cause some hardship for some Americans \u2014 specifically, those who rely on Planned Parenthood for services. Government funds currently account for 40 percent of Planned Parenthood's revenue, with much of that coming from Medicaid (but none of that going toward abortions, except in cases of rape, incest and when the mother's life is in danger). Cutting those funds could mean clinic closures or fewer services, as FiveThirtyEight explained in March. Around 15 percent of people in areas where there aren't other options for low-income people to get care would be affected, and the reduction in family planning services would mean the number of Medicaid births would go up by \"several thousand.\" Midterm turnout tends to be low, however \u2014 much lower than in presidential election years. So the bill could make a difference to the extent that it affects the views of many people who would vote anyway. But then, if people's experiences with it are particularly negative or positive, it could inspire them to turn out as well. Of course, how this affects the election at all depends not only on what else is going on but also which party people blame or praise for any changes in the health care system. Loading... By now, some pain may have kicked in for some Americans. Some who were formerly eligible for tax credits for individual market insurance premiums \u2014 that is, those between 350 and 400 percent of the federal poverty level \u2014 will no longer be eligible. The cost-sharing reduction payments that benefit lower-income people on the exchanges will also end. That could lead to lower-income people paying premiums near where they are now, but also having much higher deductibles, the CBO reported this week. In other words, health care would be more expensive for many lower-income people in the individual markets, so many may simply choose not to purchase insurance. And the amount the federal government spends to reimburse states for Medicaid will be dropping by then. If states want to maintain current levels of coverage, they will have to spend more and more of their own money. Otherwise, as the CBO wrote, states would cut spending in a number of ways: \"...cutting payments to health care providers and health plans, eliminating optional services, restricting eligibility for enrollment through work requirements and other changes, or (to the extent feasible) arriving at more efficient methods for delivering services.\" Furthermore, some older Americans would by now paying more for their health insurance, though some younger Americans could be seeing smaller premiums. But then, the number of people on the exchanges in the first place is small \u2014 around 6.4 million right now. If people on the exchanges are getting less care for more money, and if it affects their votes (that is, if those people vote), it may not be a huge bloc of voters. And the effects of these changes may be slow in coming. \"Those changes do start in 2020 and could be a problem for the election [for Republicans], but I think those market effects would be more gradual,\" said Caroline Pearson, senior vice president for policy and strategy at Avalere Health. (But then, once again, all of this is contingent upon people pinning negatives and/or positive to Republicans.) Still more factors could affect these elections, particularly Medicaid cuts. These could be getting sharper in many states, with \"churn\" in the system having taken people off the rolls who now won't be able to get back on, with the expansion dialing back. Federal Medicaid expansion funds fully rolled back The federal spending on the Medicaid expansion would be gone entirely by now \u2014 states could maintain the expansion if they had enough money, but for many states, that's unlikely. As the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities reports, some states would have to up their spending by 400 percent in 2024 to maintain the expansion. Medicaid per capita growth now pegged to a lower inflation rate (meaning lower spending in the future) By now, Medicaid will be drastically changed from what it was before the bill, with work requirements in some states, caps on spending (meaning it won't adjust for recessions, for example), and much lower enrollment in general. In addition, by now, premiums in the marketplaces will have shifted sharply. Older adults in particular could face some massive increases in premiums, as the CBO report showed.

Ivanka Trump's fashion brand has faced calls for boycott from anti-Trump activists, while Trump supporters have called for boycotts on stores refusing to sell her products. President Donald Trump may not have the most Twitter followers on the platform but he is probably the most powerful person in the world who is tweeting on a regular basis. (Look no further than the recent \"covfefe\" incident and the raging wildfire of memes it incited.) And it is precisely the president's compulsion to tweet-vent/tweet-rage that Allyson Kapin is counting on as the best vehicle to keep Democrats and progressives engaged in the national anti-Trump movement \u2014 especially novice activists. Kapin is the brains behind WeCanResist.It, a new app launched in late May that funds social justice organizations \"whose issues are being targeted by Trump.\" \"It is basically America's swear jar but for toxic ideology,\" she said. \"So every time Trump goes on a Twitter rampage or tweets something dangerous or hateful, the app lets you automatically donate to a nonprofit that's fighting to protect our democracy, human rights, or the environment,\" she explained. Unlike single or annual donations, which Kapin said can be quickly forgotten, these recurring contributions not only keep political causes top of mind, they also \"help channel people's anger and frustrations.\" The nonprofits on the receiving end of the app are vetted by Kapin and her all-volunteer team of colleagues. But, beyond providing instant gratification for her fellow lefties, Kapin is clear about the big-picture objective of the app: To keep people new to the world of political activism engaged beyond a single rally \u2014 what she describes as a growing number of first-time protesters who have not been involved in the \"activist\" space before. Additionally, Kapin hopes to draw attention to some of the smaller or less well-known advocacy groups that are often overlooked because people have never heard of them. Kapin's efforts are part of a building national movement of anti-Trump pro-cotts \u2014 when consumers seek out companies, products or services that align with their political values. Joel Naroff, president of Naroff Economic Advisors, confirms that the growing polarization that has permeated today's political discourse is mirrored in an expanding polarization in the economy and the way citizens are spending disposable income. Although he hasn't studied the phenomenon, Naroff notes there is ample evidence that consumers at large are exerting their partisan power over companies. And he argues technology is playing a critical role. \"Just look at Nordstrom,\" he said. The national department store chain dropped the Ivanka Trump brand in February after a viral campaign called #GrabYourWallet encouraged shoppers to boycott all Trump products. Officially, Nordstrom cited the brand's poor performance as the reason for the decision without explicitly stating what role the boycott or the social media backlash may have played in those dropping sales. \"Given that we've got the Internet, we've got email, we've got Twitter and everything else that's out there, the ability to reach these disaffected people and turn them into disaffected consumers is probably greater now than it's ever been,\" he said. Although he usually refrains from advising his clients to out their own political leanings, he notes many large companies benefit from publicly staking their ground. For instance, shortly after Trump announced the U.S. is withdrawing from the Paris Climate Agreement, Andy Pharoah, vice president for corporate affairs at Mars Incorporated, told NPR that he is disappointed in the president's decision, but that the candy and pet food company will be undeterred in its own efforts to combat climate change. That is the kind of statement that will likely lure chocoholics who also support stringent climate change policies. Tracking the financial gains for large companies that go out on these ideological limbs is complicated, because a multitude of factors can contribute to rising sales, but small organizations can sometimes make those connections more easily. Take Rachel Berks, owner of the boutique shop, Otherwild. Berks, who continues to be an avid Hillary Clinton supporter, was the first designer to set off the \"The Future is Female\" T-shirt craze leading up to the 2016 election. The simple cotton tee \u2014 Berk's riff on a 1960s lesbian mantra \u2014 was outperforming all of her other designs but it wasn't until she decided to donate a quarter of the proceeds to Planned Parenthood, that her business exploded. \"When I did that it really blew up and went viral,\" she said. Berk was moved to make the donation during the period when Congress was first voting to defund Planned Parenthood. Just as she was inspired to contribute, Berk said, \"I think [people] were interested in a tangible way to give back.\" It's anecdotal but Berks said it was proof to her that slews of progressives are looking for new ways to carry their political values into other areas of their private lives. \"People were feeling just like me \u2014 frustrated, hurt, asking what do we do next?\" she said. Demonstrators march Saturday, Jan. 21, 2017, in Atlanta. Thousands of people marched through Atlanta one day after President Donald Trump's inauguration.\n                \n                    \n                    John Bazemore/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Demonstrators march Saturday, Jan. 21, 2017, in Atlanta. Thousands of people marched through Atlanta one day after President Donald Trump's inauguration. Similarly, Nate Lerner, executive director of the Democratic Coalition Against Trump, took a look around his own circle of friends and observed the same longing for direction. That prompted him to create the Boycott Trump app shortly after the November election. It is essentially a searchable database that shows links between companies and the Trump administration. Lerner estimates the app has been downloaded more than 350,000 times since November. He said he created it because he was afraid to lose the momentum progressives opposing Trump had managed to build leading up to the election. Lerner wanted them to know, \"They can still speak through their wallets and through their purchasing power every day,\" he explained, \"So we wanted to remind them of that and give them the ability to take action through that.\" Since its debut, Lerner has added several new features to the app that he says make people feel more empowered. In addition to connecting users with their local representatives, they can now also email companies directly through the app to convey their dissatisfaction. Like Kapin, Lerner hopes the Boycott Trump app will act like a gateway to political action. \"There certainly is a new generation of political activists that we're seeing rise and come forward,\" he said, \"but at the same time they're not getting engaged on traditional means of political action like volunteering and donating and calling their representatives and we aim to change that.\" But there have been some unintended uses of Lerner's creation. Pro-Trump shoppers have been downloading it too in order to find and buy products that will go to companies aligned with the administration. That doesn't bother Lerner. \"If you're downloading our app and if you're using it for a negative purpose, you're actually still helping our cause,\" he said. That's because every download only helps bump up the app's rankings. \"So the joke's on them,\" he said.",

Aziz Ansari is in the midst of a whirlwind year. In January, the comic hosted Saturday Night Live the day after President Trump's inauguration \u2014 an experience he describes as \"one of the most watched stand-up sets I'll ever do in my life, if not the most.\" More recently, Ansari has been focused on his Emmy and Peabody Award-winning comedy series, Master of None, which he co-created and co-writes with Alan Yang. Ansari also stars in the show as Dev, a first-generation Indian-American actor who struggles to bridge the cultural gap between himself and his parents (who happen to be played by Ansari's actual parents). The second season of Master of None recently became available on Netflix, which means the comic is experiencing some long-awaited downtime. \"I don't know what I'm going to do now,\" he says when asked about upcoming projects. \"Let me relax for a second. Let me just live my life. Forget season three of Master of None, I'm also doing season 34 of Aziz Ansari!\" On growing up a non-religious Muslim I grew up in South Carolina, so it was kind of hard to participate in the religion because there was no mosque or anything like that. I was never really religious. I never really took to religion in general. I just remember being a kid and even having the thought of, Well, it seems like everyone's just doing whatever their parents' religion was. ... So that immediately made me skeptical of the whole thing. On how his parents feel about acting in the show My dad is a practicing gastroenterologist; my mom works at the office. When they come to do the series, they're using their vacation time to help me. My mom doesn't even like acting on the show. She's really just doing it because she loves me very much. She hates acting. Before the second season, when we announced the second season, she's like, \"OK, this season the mom character's on vacation or she's just gone.\" And I was like, \"She can't be on vacation the whole time.\" She's like, \"No, maybe she's at a wedding sometimes.\" She just didn't want to be a part of it. She did it because she loves me and my brother is also heavily involved with the show. It's a really special thing that we get to do this together. ... And after the [first] season aired, my dad came to New York and we went on Stephen Colbert's show together. ... And we went out to dinner afterwards, and he was telling me, ... \"The reason I'm acting in the show and doing all of this is just to spend more time with you and to see you.\" On working with Lena Waithe to write the \"Thanksgiving\" episode, which was based on Waithe's own experience growing up black and gay, and coming out to her family I told [Lena] from the get-go, \"You need to write this with me and I'll help you and we'll get this in shape and make it feel like the show. But you've got to make sure we get this right.\" ... I guess I don't have the gall of all those white writers who write for minorities. Aziz Ansari That episode, it's just me and four black women, the whole episode. I joked with Melina [Matsoukas], who directed the episode, and Lena, \"This is the most amount of screen time I've seen on any film or television show, with one Indian character and four black women.\" How am I going to write that episode by myself? It would be offensive! You know? I guess I don't have the gall of all those white writers who write for minorities. On what it's like to date when you're famous It doesn't really affect things as much as people assume. It affects things in ways that people don't understand or predict. ... The thing that's tricky is it's a very weird lifestyle. If you're filming something in another place, you're living in another city for three months. It's weird if ... other people are taking pictures of you all of the time and you go out on one date with someone and there's pictures of you guys together. That stuff is kind of intense. Just having the public scrutiny of your personal relationships, that stuff is weird. But I don't have that at the level of other more famous people. But in my life I haven't found it to be something that causes me too much [problems]. I'm dealing with the same thing the guy in the show is; you're trying to find a meaningful connection with someone, no matter who you are. On hosting SNL and delivering the opening monologue the day after Trump's inauguration What's interesting about doing SNL is no matter how many times you practice in a comedy club, it's happening that day. So with the whole election and inauguration, everyone's mood was changing every day and crazy things were happening every day. So you never knew what you were going to be in for that Saturday. The day before, on the inauguration, everyone was so down and depressed. The whole mood on the set was so bad. And then the next day, Saturday, there was the Women's March and everyone's spirits were boosted and it was a totally different environment. No matter how many times you practice in a comedy club, being there at SNL, at that stage, it's not like any comedy club.

President Trump is set to sign an executive order on Thursday that aims to relax restrictions on political activity by religious groups without threatening their tax-exempt status. According to a senior White House official, the order will reiterate the White House's commitment to religious liberty; will direct the IRS to use \"maximum enforcement discretion\" to ease the burdens of the Johnson Amendment, which regulates political activity of non-profits such as churches; and will call for \"regulatory relief\" from the Affordable Care Act mandate that employer-provided health care plans provide free birth control and other reproductive health services. Trump will sign the executive order Thursday morning on the National Day of Prayer. The White House has not yet released the full text of the executive order. The directives are among the promises Trump made on the campaign trail that would blur government lines dividing church and state. In meetings with religious leaders last year, Trump pledged to \"get rid\" of IRS rules that prohibited tax-exempt groups like churches from engaging in political advocacy, NPR's Sarah McCammon reported. However, such rules, established by the 1954 Johnson Amendment, are rarely enforced. Trump repeated the pledge as president at the National Prayer Breakfast in February, saying that he \"will get rid of and totally destroy\" the restrictions in order to \"allow our representatives of faith to speak freely and without fear of retribution.\" However, there are limits to what this executive order can do, and Trump himself is not able to repeal the Johnson Amendment, which would take an act of Congress. While some evangelical voters \u2014 who comprised a significant portion of Trump's base during the election \u2014 are sure to champion the new rules on political advocacy, it is not clear whether the religious liberty language will satisfy social conservatives. The language does not appear to go as far as one reported draft that leaked in February, just after Trump spoke at the National Prayer Breakfast. Such an order would radically redefine what constitutes a religious organization, and reports of its consideration raised widespread backlash and predictions that the rules would not hold up in court. That initial order never materialized. The new executive order does give some religious groups, such as the Little Sisters of the Poor, one of the things they had hoped for from Trump \u2014 allowing religious entities to stop providing contraception in their employee health care plans if they have religious objections. In 2014, the Supreme Court ruled that closely-held private corporations such as Hobby Lobby, which brought the challenge, did not have to comply with the contraception mandate if it violated their religious beliefs. The order also comes after the White House and Republicans made concessions, such as continuing to fund Planned Parenthood, in the latest spending bill, that many religious conservatives wanted undone. Even what the order does call for will not be met with universal acclaim by evangelical groups. The National Association of Evangelicals, or NAE, released a survey in March that showed that pastors overwhelmingly opposed endorsing candidates from the pulpit. The directives from the White House could give pastors the comfort to do that with the assurance that the IRS will not come after them and challenge their church's tax-exempt status. \"Evangelicals emphasize evangelism, and pastors often avoid controversies that might take priority over the gospel message,\" said NAE President Leith Anderson in a statement about the poll. \"Most pastors I know don't want to endorse politicians. They want to focus on teaching the Bible.\" But other fervent Trump backers, such as Liberty University president Jerry Falwell, Jr., have championed Trump's push to do away with the political restrictions. \"It's used as a club, by the [Internal Revenue Service] and the left, to silence conservatives,\" Falwell told the Lynchburg, Va., News & Advance in February.

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump, pictured at Tuesday's Commander-in-Chief trophy presentation ceremony, has spent three days and nights in a frenzy of mixed messaging.\n                \n                    \n                    Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption President Donald Trump, pictured at Tuesday's Commander-in-Chief trophy presentation ceremony, has spent three days and nights in a frenzy of mixed messaging. President Trump has a flair \u2014 perhaps a genius \u2014 for counter-programming, which can be described as the art of upstaging your rivals just when they think they're about to have their spotlight moment. He did it countless times as a candidate, eclipsing all the other Republican contenders and the Democrats as well. He demonstrated his prowess again on the 100th day of his presidency, rallying a blue-collar crowd in Pennsylvania and shunning the annual black-tie White House Correspondents' Association Dinner. On the basis of visuals alone, Trump was the man of the people at war with the elite of the capital. It was the split-screen reality show par excellence. But the president has since spent three days and nights in a frenzy of mixed messaging that has counter-programmed not only his rivals but his own administration, his own party and even himself. The result is a new level of confusion and disarray at a moment when many had expected the White House team to find its groove and go forward. The disruptions began Sunday, on the morning of Trump's 101st day in office, as eye-popping items from Trump's various interviews spread out on all platforms. We learned the White House welcome mat would be out for Philippine strongman Rodrigo Duterte, a man said to have ordered thousands of extra-judicial killings in his war on drugs. Trump's chief of staff explained that the U.S. needed Duterte as part of a campaign to isolate Kim Jong Un, but then we also heard the president say the North Korean dictator was \"a smart cookie\" and that Trump would be \"honored\" to meet with him. So, just as the \"dancing with dictators\" storyline got going, the White House doors were opened to the morning hosts of CBS News, who talked with a gaggle of top Trump advisers \u2014 the ones from Manhattan who reassure Wall Street and the GOP mainstream. Even Ivanka Trump \"dropped in\" to chat and to charm. In his flurry of interviews, the president said, \"We'll take a look at\" breaking up the biggest banks. But his Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin had already told a meeting of investors they should thank him \"for how your bank stocks are doing.\" Indeed, the financial sector has led the post-election rally; and bank shares recovered and climbed, brushing off Trump's own off-hand threat. Making the rounds of the TV networks, the president made various claims about the latest version of the House bill to repeal and replace Obamacare. He said he had ordered that the bill \"take care of sick people\" and protect those with pre-existing conditions. Never mind that the latest version would allow states to opt out of key provisions affecting just those kinds of people. Monday, the debate over pre-existing conditions was hopelessly confused, yet White House officials were boldly predicting passage this week. We have also seen endless TV replays of the Oval Office confrontation with CBS' John Dickerson, with whom Trump doubled down yet again on his accusations that former President Obama had him wiretapped at Trump Tower last fall \u2014 an often debunked charge for which Trump once again offered no evidence. One theory about the president's most recent static storm sees it as strategic, designed to distract from the spending deal reached by House and Senate negotiators from both parties over the weekend \u2014 a package they will vote through this week to keep the government operating. Why distract from news of a bipartisan, bicameral agreement? Was it not good news that there would not be a shutdown? Well, perhaps, but the price for that news turned out to be heavy indeed. The administration had to give in on spending for the border wall (which was specifically ruled out), got only half the increase Trump wanted on defense spending and failed to cut off funding for Planned Parenthood or subsidies for health care insurance under Obamacare. Deep cuts proposed to the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Institutes of Health and public broadcasting went away. Spending for domestic programs, a category the president had previously vowed to freeze, rose. It is not hard to understand why the White House wanted everybody talking about Duterte, health care and phone calls to Vladimir Putin instead of the details of that spending deal. Moreover, we need to remember that Trump's messaging uses different media to reach different audiences. While official Washington might have been glad to have the government keep running another five months, Trump was mindful of those who see things differently. The president took to Twitter to blame the spending deal on the Senate and its 60-vote threshold for major legislation. \"Either elect more Republican senators in 2018 or change the rules now to 51%,\" said the president in a tweet. Current GOP senators quickly disassociated themselves from that notion, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell flatly ruled it out. No chance. Zero. Still, the president was not done. He added: \"Our country needs a good 'shutdown' in September to fix mess!\" Never mind that this same man had just signed a stopgap bill last Friday to avoid just such a shutdown. And never mind that he would be signing the larger spending deal this week to fund the government through September. And so we wonder: when the cameras are shut off and he puts down the smartphone, is there a long game, a larger vision? Does all the counter-programming recede and a presidential program emerge? He can only spend so much time going to Pennsylvania in his mind.",

            "article_content": "Rachel Baiman's Shame comes out June 2.\n                \n                    \n                    Gina R. Binkley/Courtesy of the artist\n                    \n                \nhide caption Rachel Baiman's Shame comes out June 2. There's a presumption among some people who have little contact with old-time, string band, bluegrass and folk music that those are mostly stagnant traditions, stuck in some sort of distant, Arcadian past and locked into so-called primitive patterns. The truth of the matter is that those traditions can be strikingly elastic, and they continue to attract new generations of keen musical minds, like Chicago-bred banjo and fiddle player Rachel Baiman. After moving to Nashville, she spent several years exploring the possibilities of instrumental interplay, frequenting an old-time jam at a small bar, forming the inventively spare, rhythmically honed duo 10 String Symphony with fellow fiddle player Christian Sedelmyer and taking occasional side gigs, including a pair of Kacey Musgraves shows at the Ryman Auditorium. Recently, though, 27-year-old Baiman has been reckoning with other aspects of her roots and testing her music's potential to carry a timely message, raised as she was by social-worker and radical-economist parents who hauled her to the Ethical Humanist Society of Greater Chicago on Sundays. Following last fall's presidential election, she teamed up with picker pals in Nashville and New York City to organize politically-focused benefit shows under the banner of Folk Fights Back. \"Shame,\" the title track of her upcoming album, captures the spirit of wry truth-telling that she's cultivated in some of her latest work. A jaunty banjo figure bobs above a strolling folk-rock groove and sets a playful tone, while her lyrics, delivered with reedy, willful nonchalance, critique the merging of religious, moral and political influence. Baiman sat down with NPR at an East Nashville cafe and explained where she's coming from over a cup of tea. Jewly Hight: Thanks to 10 String Symphony, I knew you to be a virtuosic tweaker of tradition, but I didn't really have a sense of your voice or vantage point until I heard this solo album. Is your solo work meant to create space for that? Rachel Baiman: Absolutely. I would say that I didn't necessarily have a sense of my voice prior to this project. It's not your first solo album. It's not my first, but it's my first that's original songwriting. The project that I did in 2014 was based on exploring instrumental interests that I had and playing with songs that I knew from other traditions. I feel like this is my first [project] of my songs. I think it was that I had written a few of these songs and I really felt like I wanted to do them as me, just because they felt so personal. The title track instantly reminded me of an old-timey singer-songwriter who arrived a couple of generations ahead of you, John Hartford. Oh, it's absolutely inspired by John Hartford, the feel of that first track. I had written the lyrics already, but in thinking about how I wanted to present it musically, I was definitely going for a feel with the combination of the banjo and the half-time drums, kind of the raw acoustic-electric combination. It's very serious lyrically, but I wanted it to feel positive and fun, something you can enjoy singing along to and be uplifted by rather than this crushing, dark thing. I mean, John Hartford music is some of the best-feeling music that I can think of. I think people also remember him as something of a philosopher. So I wondered if the way he integrated his musings with his musical wit was something you connect with in general. Absolutely. He's very conversational in his lyrics, in the sense that he'll include a really specific detail or say something in a really silly way, but it's actually very profound, what he's saying. He does it in a way that you don't feel like you're listening to something that is ivory-tower language. One of my other biggest musical heroes is Courtney Barnett, and she kind of does the same thing lyrically, where she talks about these really everyday things and you feel like you're just listening to someone yap to their friend, and you kind of laugh about it, but then you're like, \"Oh, that was actually really smart.\" I gather that your song \"Shame\" was inspired by a Dan Savage rant about Texas defunding Planned Parenthood, and the connection between the religious right and the pro-life movement in general. How'd you get from Savage's pointed message to your more personalized and conversational treatment of the topic? I had written the verses from a very personal standpoint, my own relationship with religion. Then I was looking for some sort of message that really tied it together. I felt like I knew what I wanted to say, but I hadn't really gotten it out. Then listening to Dan Savage talk about defunding Planned Parenthood and the way that those efforts are kind of not focused on actual pro-life goals kind of brought the song together for me. The first line of the second verse is \"Old white men write books about faith and...\" \"Healing love.\" That almost sounds like you're trying to pinpoint the source of the problem. I mean, I didn't have a specific person in mind. It was more just a commentary on the fact that it seems to me that these condemnations are always made by these people that are not going to be ever in the [vulnerable] positions [they're talking about]. It's interesting for me, because I've always been outside of that, because I wasn't raised with religion. When did you become self-conscious about the difference between your background and others' backgrounds? In high school and growing up, I wasn't so concerned about feminism, and I think it's because I didn't really have to be. Moving down here and befriending people that had strong religious backgrounds, it was actually my first understanding of how real religion was in so many people's lives. Because I was starting a more professional career and starting to gig and things like that, it was also my first realization that I was treated differently, trying to be a professional musician and always feeling like \"the girl.\" Sometimes it takes leaving your native context to develop that self-awareness. I'm really glad that I went somewhere that was challenging to me in terms of a bit of culture shock and a bit of understanding that the whole world didn't think the same way that I did. I think that's really important and super healthy, to understand that people that have these opinions aren't idiots. They're not crazy. They just have been raised a different way. I think I had to work through a lot of that too, from being a super self-righteous kid that thought I knew everything. I read that when you were younger, you were overwhelmed by the global scale of social and political issues, and music became a way for you to engage. How did that happen? My dad is a radical economist and he's obsessed with politics and economics and everything that's going on in the world at large. That was daily conversation over dinner every night: terrible things that had happened in the world, everything that's wrong with the political structure. Having your parents tell you that the world is ending when you're, like, 7 or 8, it's, like, really scary. When I left home, I was so focused on music. I didn't want to be thinking about politics at all. I think I just needed a break from it and I needed to figure out what I thought outside of what I was told over and over. I think that's part of why I dove into music so intensely. It felt so concretely meaningful, whereas these other things felt so huge and like I couldn't do anything about them. I guess I've been here eight or nine years now, and it's only now, and partially because of the Trump presidency, that I feel strongly about getting back into the political realm, being active in that. What exactly is Folk Fights Back? It's this fledgling organization that I started with two friends \u2014 one in New York, Lily Henley, and one here in Nashville, Kaitlyn Raitz. We started it right after Trump was elected. It's a series of benefit shows bringing together the folk music community and focusing on one issue. The first one was in January, and had an environmental focus. It just happened in Nashville and New York. In March, we did Folk Fights Back for Immigrants and Refugees, and that was in New York; Boston; Chicago; Nashville; Stockholm, Sweden and Toronto, Canada. They all happened around the same day, so it's like a day of solidarity. That was amazing. We raised over $12,000 for local refugee and immigrant groups. The concept behind it is that the show itself should be an awareness event, so I was getting in touch with all these bands that are outside my little bubble that have immigrants in them or people of different backgrounds, trying to get people in the same room that haven't met each other. A lot of the musicians you've enlisted are your 20- or 30-something peers. How have you seen your generation of old-time, string-band, folk and bluegrass musicians embracing activism lately? You come into the Trump presidency and you realize, \"What a privilege it's been to have the apathy of, 'OK, well, it's all going to be basically fine, so I'm just gonna focus on my own s***.' \" I do think that my peers at large, myself included, have had a real awakening. I think everyone has a responsibility and a role. For musicians who are touring and talking to people on stage every night and having a voice through their music, I think many are feeling much more inclined to speak out politically. I think it's great if you push the envelope a little bit and make people a little uncomfortable with music. Everybody has their different ways of going about it. Do you see links between the work you all are doing and the activism of earlier generations of folkies? Yeah. I guess it's more akin to the '60s, the Bob Dylan and Woody Guthrie era, where folk musicians had that more specific role. In Nashville, it's interesting because you have folk [music] that's traditionally very liberal and you have country and bluegrass that's traditionally very conservative, and it's sort of a music of nostalgia and celebrating the past. When you are in the South, playing traditional music is more about celebrating the way things were. It's an interesting one, being sort of in the middle of those traditions, because I play bluegrass and I love country music and I play old-time and folk music. I think down here it's especially cool, because you're seeing a lot of those bands that traditionally would've been nostalgic kind of flip and go, \"Yay, the past!\" but also, \"Yay, doing things a little bit better now!\" \u2014 a lot of Southern liberal bands and musicians coming out of these traditionally conservative genres. And I think the folk scene that has always been politically left and liberal continues to do that, but it's more interesting when you can see a change and a new reach.

            "article_content": "A Russian think tank planned to swing the U.S. election. DNC chairman Perez speaks at a state party dinner, as they try to capitalize on gains made in a Georgia district. Fox drops Bill O'Reilly.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: And I'm Steve Inskeep with a guide to this day's news. David, where do we start? DAVID GREENE, HOST: Well, Steve, I want to start with a new report that seems to be shedding light on just how Russia interfered in the U.S. election. There have been all these questions, as we know, since the campaign about exactly what the Russians did and whether they were trying to benefit Donald Trump, who spoke so often about getting along with them. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I would love to be able to get along with Russia. Now, you've had a lot of presidents that haven't taken that tact. Look where we are now. GREENE: That's President Trump back in February. OK, so this new reporting from Reuters suggests that the Russian government had high hopes for working with Trump as well. There are documents from a Russian think tank that was backed by Vladimir Putin describing this plan to use propaganda and Russian-backed news outlets to sway American voters in 2016. INSKEEP: Domenico Montanaro of NPR's Politics team is with us once again. Hi, Domenico. DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Good morning, Steve. INSKEEP: And also Ned Parker of Reuters, who broke this story about the Russian think tank. He's in New York. Welcome. NED PARKER: Morning. INSKEEP: So would you remind us, Ned, what was known about Russian interference before your report? PARKER: Well, what was known was that the Russian government had hacked the U.S. Democratic Party's offices and the Clinton campaign. And in January, the U.S. intelligence agencies issued a public report saying that not only had Russia hacked and disseminated information from the Democratic Party, but it had worked through an information campaign using media platforms that it controls and social media to spread a message using some of these hacked, stolen Democratic materials - many of which were embarrassing to the Democrats - to favor Trump and... INSKEEP: Drive the news agenda, so to speak. So what does your report, the documents that you describe, add to that picture? PARKER: Well, what's significant about it is that these are Russian documents from an internal Kremlin think tank that answers to Vladimir Putin, a think tank that is run by former Russian foreign intelligence spies. And in writing, it talks about how to influence the U.S. electorate through a media and social media campaign to pick a U.S. administration that will be favorable to Russia and its policies as opposed to the policies that were ongoing under President Obama. And this document, the first one, was written in June 2016, and so... INSKEEP: I was just wondering what the date was - so just as things were heating up and actually just as - at a point when it was clear that Trump would be the nominee. PARKER: Exactly. So it - as it was described to me by some of our sources, this was the equivalent of having a NSC policy document or a strategy document from within the State Department's Policy Planning department. INSKEEP: National Security Council, yeah. PARKER: Yeah, exactly. INSKEEP: Let me play a little clip of President Trump here. This is from his news conference in February when he addressed questions of collusion with Russia. (SOUNDBITE OF NEWS CONFERENCE) TRUMP: I have nothing to do with Russia, haven't made a phone call to Russia in years, don't speak to people from Russia - not that I wouldn't. I just have nobody to speak to. INSKEEP: So he says. Is there strong evidence of collusion between Russia and the Trump administration? PARKER: Well, this issue is under investigation right now by the FBI and two congressional committees looking at the Russian role in the U.S. elections. But in these documents, they do not mention the Trump campaign, nor do they mention the actual hacking by the Russians within the United States. But it talks about a coordinated media and social media campaign to influence the U.S. electorate. INSKEEP: Domenico, very briefly, are the congressional investigations into all of this back on track? MONTANARO: Look, the key question is what Ned just laid out there is the coordination, you know, if there was any between Russia and those associated with Trump. GREENE: You know, I mean, it's such a stark reminder, listening to all of this, there is that question, as you guys just said, of whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia. We don't know that - a lot of politics involved there. But apart from that, there is clear evidence Russia is meddling in politics, in the United States, across Europe. It doesn't matter your political party. That is pretty worrisome for any democracy. INSKEEP: OK. Ned Parker of Reuters, thanks very much. Congrats on the story. PARKER: Thank you. INSKEEP: And, David, Democrats, which we'll talk about next, want to capitalize on a House race in Georgia. GREENE: Yeah. Tom Perez, the Democratic Party chairman, is going to be speaking in Georgia tonight - a lot of people looking to see what he says. The Democratic candidate for an open House seat there, as we've heard this week, is bound for a runoff after getting more votes than anyone else in a very red district. And Perez is going to Georgia. He's traveling with Bernie Sanders. And they spoke last night in Miami. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TOM PEREZ: Just yesterday, because of the collective power of we in this room and across America, Jon Ossoff won 48 percent of the vote there. (APPLAUSE) PEREZ: And we will continue to win because you know what, folks? When we put our unity and our energy and our values into action, that translates to results. INSKEEP: Domenico Montanaro of NPR's Politics team is still with us and, Domenico, would it be impolite to note that the Democrats still haven't won in Georgia or anywhere else? MONTANARO: (Laughter) Well, that's absolutely true. I mean, 48 percent is clearly better than the congressional candidate did there in 2016. So raising the floor is an important thing, even if Ossoff was to lose by a couple of points this year. But I want to say a couple things about Perez and this tour that he's kind of doing with Bernie Sanders right now. You know, really, the one thing that unifies Democrats right now is Donald Trump, and you could hear that from Perez. You know, he'll likely to continue to beat that drum. But, I mean, this unity tour he's on with Bernie Sanders has kind of gotten off to a rocky start. I don't know if you've noticed, but Perez was booed Monday in Maine. He was booed last night in scattered portions in Miami. Sanders refused to identify as a Democrat when he was asked about it on cable in a joint interview with Perez. So right now, to me, it's like Perez is doing something important. He's trying to - he's trying to bring the progressive base together, but he's kind of like someone without any training trying to walk a tiger on a leash, frankly. INSKEEP: And you said the Democrats are unified by Trump, but when Karen Handel, who's the Republican who also made it into this runoff in Georgia, was asked on CNN if Trump is going to campaign for her now, she said this. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KAREN HANDEL: I would hope so. I mean, look, we - all Republicans, it's all hands on deck for us. INSKEEP: Can the president still fire up his base even if he's not so popular? MONTANARO: He can absolutely fire up his base. Unfortunately for him, and for Republicans, this district isn't exactly Trump country. It's well-educated. It's suburban Republicans who - you know, where Trump underperformed. He's not the most popular in this district. He has a tremendous bullhorn. He's been following this race closely. You can bet he'll weigh in again, whether Republicans want him to or not. GREENE: You know, Domenico, I want to bring up something that you wrote about. The Republican in this race, Karen Handel, after she lost her bid for governor in 2010, she joined the Komen Foundation. She pushed to eliminate its funding for Planned Parenthood. That caused an uproar. The money was restored. I mean, Planned Parenthood gets voters animated on both sides, and I think I'm watching for that to become an issue in this race. INSKEEP: OK. That's NPR's Domenico Montanaro this morning. Domenico, thanks very much. MONTANARO: All right, thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF ASTR SONG, \"BLEEDING LOVE\") INSKEEP: Hey, it turns out that it is lucky for Stephen Colbert that he got out of that program in which he satirized Bill O'Reilly while he still could. GREENE: That's right because Bill O'Reilly is now gone from Fox News. There are these accusations of sexual harassment against him and news of millions of dollars in past settlements. All of this prompted Fox to remove really its biggest star. His show had lost many of its advertisers, and now Tucker Carlson is going to take over that slot. O'Reilly departs with a statement that says, quote, \"it's tremendously disheartening that we part ways due to completely unfounded claims,\" end quote. INSKEEP: Hadas Gold, a media reporter for POLITICO, is with us. Thanks for coming by this morning, really appreciate it. HADAS GOLD: It's so great to be here. INSKEEP: Weren't there allegations against Bill O'Reilly for years and years before this? GOLD: I mean, since 2004. I'm sure you remember that there was a very big case that was settled. Now we know it was settled for $9 million, according to The New York Times. This was the former producer. And, you know what? After that case, if we think if that had happened now, if - the result would have been a little bit different. But in 2004, the case was settled. They both agreed, both sides agreed, to have - to admit no wrongdoing, and that was it. INSKEEP: OK. So 2004 versus now - what's changed in the country, do you think? GOLD: I definitely think that the awareness of sexual harassment has changed. You also have to look at Fox News what's changed. Roger Ailes is no longer in charge of Fox News. And Roger Ailes... INSKEEP: Having gone away after his own awkward situation to say the least. GOLD: Exactly. And Roger Ailes really kind of inoculated a lot of his loyal hosts from potentially having to depart the network over such allegations. INSKEEP: OK. Our media correspondent, David Folkenflik, has talked to people inside Fox, as I'm sure you have, and there were a lot of people upset. Is Fox really a different place today? GOLD: Listen, a lot of people will point to the fact that, yes, Roger Ailes is gone. Yes, there are some other people gone, but for the most part, the rest of the management is in place. The co-presidents right now worked very closely under Roger Ailes. And one thing that some people have pointed out to me inside Fox is that it's not like the entire place is a giant fraternity house. The bad behavior was limited to a certain group of powerful people, it seems. And there is a sense, though, that this was a business decision - 100 percent. INSKEEP: It's about money because O'Reilly was losing advertisers, and there was this Sky News deal that might have been messed up. GOLD: Exactly. So over in the U.K., the Fox parent company is trying to purchase a bigger stake in Sky News, which is really their - has been their goal for quite some time now. Ofcom, which is the media regulator in the U.K., has a fit-and-proper test, and they have a decision on this in the next few weeks. And they could decide, based off of how Fox handled these types of allegations, also how Fox paid these settlements, that they are not fit and proper. And that is a big factor in this decision.

            "article_content": "President Trump took a big step forward this week in his long-running legal battle for more control over one of his most valuable assets in China: his name. On its website on Wednesday, China's Trademark Office announced the trademark registration for a Trump construction-services business in China. That might not sound like a huge win, but it could open the door to many more products and businesses Trump wants to trademark in China. Over the past decade, Trump reportedly has lodged dozens of trademark applications in China for, among other things, pet care products, golf clubs, lingerie and computer software. As Trump's name has become increasingly popular in the Asian nation, a multitude of Chinese-owned businesses have slapped the word \"Trump\" on their products \u2014 on everything from condoms to toilets to pesticides, according to The Associated Press. So China's decision to grant Trump the one registration might open the door for Trump to not only trademark more of his own business interests there, but also to wrest back control of his name from others who are using it. China provisionally granted approval for the construction-services trademark on Nov. 13, just days after Trump had won the U.S. presidential election. Interested parties had three months, until Feb. 14th, to dispute the decision. With that deadline now expired, the Trump name registration can go forward. Kathleen Clark, a government ethics professor at Washington University in St. Louis, says foreign trademarks present both a conflict of interest for Trump and breach of the Emoluments Clause in the U.S. Constitution. That clause prevents the president from receiving gifts and other payments from foreign governments. Clark says Beijing's power to offer Trump the valuable name-rights approval he wants is something the president may have in his mind when making policy decisions involving China. \"What I think this demonstrates is that when Donald Trump is dealing with the Chinese government on behalf of the United States, he also may be thinking about what the Chinese government can do not just for the U.S. but for Donald Trump and his businesses and his own financial well being,\" she said.",

After a dozen tumultuous days in the White House, President Trump on Tuesday night found a way to unite his party, delight his most ardent supporters and change the storyline on his nascent presidency in a single stroke. It wasn't magic that did it, it was the choice of Neil Gorsuch to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court. Gorsuch is now a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit Court, which sits in Colorado, his home state. Gorsuch began his service at that powerful level of the federal judiciary in 2006, at age 39. Well-regarded even then, Gorsuch won Senate approval on a voice vote. He has since emerged as a leading candidate for promotion to the high court. Indeed, he might have been chosen by any of the more conventional Republican presidential candidates in 2016. But the night of his anointing began with the key light on the president, who strode into the East Room by himself and mounted a podium to the lectern. \"I took the task of this nomination very seriously,\" Trump intoned. \"I have selected an individual whose qualities define \u2014 really, and I mean closely define \u2014 what we're looking for. Judge Gorsuch has outstanding legal skills, a brilliant mind, tremendous discipline, and has earned bipartisan support.\" He had been on a list of 21 names Trump said had been suggested to him by conservative think tanks and advocacy groups determined to find a suitable successor to the late Antonin Scalia. It was impossible to clone Scalia, the anchor of the court's conservative wing for a generation. But Trump seemed resolved to come as close as he could, and that led him to the man from Colorado. \"Months ago as a candidate, I publicly presented a list of brilliant and accomplished people to the American electorate and pledged to make my choice from among that list,\" Trump said. \"Millions of voters said this was the single most important issue to them when they voted for me for president.\" Indeed, exit polls showed that filling Scalia's seat was \"an important factor\" for 48 percent of those who voted and the most important factor for another 21 percent. Among those who said it was the most important, a clear majority voted for Trump. \"I am a man of my word. I will do as I say, something that the American people have been asking for from Washington for a very, very long time,\" Trump said Tuesday night. It could be said that the new president has been doing what he had promised since his Inauguration Day on a range of other issues, and none of his other actions have engendered the broad-based positive reaction that greeted Gorsuch. In fact, the announcement had originally been scheduled for Thursday night, and it appeared to have been moved up to counter the rocky rollout of the president's new restrictions on refugees and others arriving to the U.S. from seven predominantly Muslim countries. That set of moves, which culminated in the firing of Acting Attorney General Sally Yates on Monday night, had dominated the news since Friday. But as of late Tuesday afternoon, that storm seemed to subside, if only long enough to make room for the dramatic announcement at the White House. Instead of bringing out his nominee in a daytime visit to the Rose Garden, Trump scheduled a prime-time event and created added suspense by refusing to confirm Gorsuch's selection before that event. It was even reported that a \"runner-up\" candidate, Judge Thomas Hardiman of the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, had been summoned to Washington and might be present at the White House event Tuesday night. The notion conjured up images of The Apprentice or other reality shows produced by Trump where contestants are kept in suspense onstage until a final winner is named. In the end, the actual event was not nearly so dramatic or unconventional. A gathering of Republican senators, lawyers and other denizens of the judicial system filled the East Room and provided hearty applause. Among those praising the choice of Gorsuch was Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Senate majority leader who kept the Scalia seat vacant last year by refusing to process President Barack Obama's nomination of Judge Merrick Garland. McConnell said the voters of November 2016 should have a say, and stuck by that even when it appeared those voters would choose Hillary Clinton to succeed Obama. When Trump won the Electoral College, McConnell's gamble paid off. He has since made it clear he will \"guarantee\" Trump's nominee is not only considered but confirmed. He has only 52 Republican votes toward the 60 needed to cut off debate on a nominee, but he can either recruit eight Democrats or change the rules to make the filibuster unavailable in this instance. Recruiting that much Democratic support might seem difficult at this stage, with the partisan fervor still running high. But 10 of the Senate's Democrats who face re-election struggles in 2018 are in states that were won by Trump in 2016. A filibuster of Gorsuch might be costly to their prospects. On the other hand, every Democrat in Congress must deal with a high level of anger among core constituents, who are demanding relentless resistance to virtually every move Trump makes. So the warm feelings in the East Room at announcement time had only begun to fade when the battle lines began forming on cable TV, in social media and countless emails. The White House called Gorsuch \"impossible to oppose\" and produced a list of supporters from Colorado and conservative circles, studded with a few Democrats who have at least praised Gorsuch in the past. But there was plenty of pushback from Democrats in Congress and various advocacy groups. Progressives, in particular, took issue with Gorsuch's well-known views on \"religious liberty\" and his willingness to let employers refuse to provide birth control services under Obamacare. Also noted was his devotion to the rights of gun owners, as well as those of campaign donors facing strictures under campaign finance reform. Gorsuch also has been controversial for questioning the long-standing practice of court deference to the interpretive expertise of administrative agencies when laws leave legislators' intentions ambiguous. Some Democrats also found in Gorsuch a symbol of Trump's overall approach to governing and his alleged indifference to the interests of certain constituencies. Sen. Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, a state won by Trump, released a statement that said, in part: \"With this Supreme Court nomination, President Trump has made it clear he has no interest in being a President for all Americans and that he is intent on creating more division in our country.\" She predicted he would not find much bipartisan support, a suggestion seconded by more senior Democrats such as their Senate leader, Charles Schumer of New York, and Judiciary Committee ranking Democrat Dianne Feinstein of California. Many of the Democrats couched their critiques in references to the lack of consideration of the Garland nomination last year. One was Pat Leahy of Vermont, the former chairman of the Judiciary Committee: \"Before Senate Republicans waged the unprecedented blockade of Judge Garland's nomination to the Supreme Court last year, the Senate took seriously its constitutional duty to provide advice and consent on nominees to the highest court in the land. But Republicans abdicated the Senate's constitutional role by choosing politically-charged obstruction, so that a president [Trump] who lost the popular vote could nominate extreme candidates to the Supreme Court.\" The Garland history is indeed a bitter pill for Democrats to swallow at this moment. But they also struggle with the dilemma that has always plagued Senate minority parties when presented with an adversarial president's nominee to the court. They can resist, in all likelihood losing and looking weak in the process, or they can stand down and sidestep the fight, risking the rage of activists in their support base who are most incensed about Trump's court choice \u2014 or about Trump in general. There was one sense in which Gorsuch did not seem to fit the profile Trump had initially sketched for his Supreme Court pick. Trump had wanted to move in a more unconventional or anti-establishment direction, but on Tuesday night he was touting his man's exceptional Ivy League pedigree. In addition to degrees from Columbia University and Harvard Law School (both with honors, as Trump himself stressed), Gorsuch earned a doctorate from Oxford University before clerking for Supreme Court Justices Byron White and Anthony Kennedy. (If confirmed, Gorsuch will be the first former clerk to share the Supreme Court bench with the justice he once served.) Gorsuch thanked previous mentors Kennedy and White in his remarks Tuesday night. He also described a bit of his own judicial philosophy, saying that \"in our legal order it is for Congress and not the courts to write new laws.\" \"It is the role of judges to apply, not alter, the work of the people's representatives,\" he added. \"A judge who likes every outcome he reaches is very likely a bad judge. [W]hen we judges don our robes, it doesn't make us any smarter, but it does serve as a reminder of what's expected of us: impartiality and independence, collegiality and courage.\"",

Similar marches are planned in more than 600 other cities and towns around the world. But the largest is expected to take place in Washington, D.C., less than 24 hours into the presidency of Donald Trump. Organizers are expecting around 200,000 marchers to gather on the National Mall.

It will feature speeches by Angela Davis, Gloria Steinem and the mothers of Trayvon Martin and Eric Garner, as well as musical performances by artists including Janelle Mon\u00e1e, Maxwell and the Indigo Girls. While the initial idea was formed as a protest of the presidential election results, organizers say the march is not all about Trump. Instead, they say they're marching to remind the country about the need to expand and protect the rights of all women. Their demands span from paid family leave and affordable access to abortion and birth control to accountability in cases of police brutality and a higher minimum wage.

Besides a debate over policy issues, the march has also generated a discussion about race and feminism. \"This march was initially put together by white women, and a lot of women of color felt they weren't part of the conversation,\" explains Carmen Perez, one of the march's national organizers who has been highlighting challenges specifically facing women of color, including those in the immigrant and LGBT communities. There has been some pushback against the organizers' emphasis on race, and some participants say they have decided to drop out of the march in protest. But Perez says she and other organizers hope discussing racial inequities will encourage marchers to find common cause with activists of different backgrounds. \"We can't continue to work in isolation. We can't continue to be one-dimensional,\" she says. \"We have to make sure that we look up, that we begin to really coordinate our efforts.\"",

As their first major act of the new Congress, Republicans rushed approval of a budget resolution this week that sets up a framework for repealing Obamacare, but what exactly to replace it with is still a puzzle Republicans are piecing together. And it could take a while. \"We're not holding hard deadlines, only because we want to get it right,\" House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., told reporters this week. The budget resolution does include a Jan. 27 deadline for committees to report back with repeal legislation, but lawmakers have made abundantly clear they're going to blow past that date. Ryan says Republicans will use their annual GOP retreat for a \"full, exhausting\" conversation on how exactly to repeal and replace the law. The go-slow approach is at odds with the increasing urgency of the rhetoric on the state of the Affordable Care Act. \"We are on a rescue mission to prevent Obamacare from making things even worse,\" Ryan pledged. What do we know? Congressional leaders and President-elect Donald Trump have pledged that repeal legislation and the GOP alternative to replace will occur at roughly the same time. Trump this week pledged it will happen \"essentially simultaneously.\" The incoming president said they will not offer a plan until his nominee for Health and Human Services secretary, Rep. Tom Price, R-Ga., is confirmed. Republicans expect a significant amount of the repeal effort to come through executive action by HHS since much of the implementation of Obamacare was done through the same agency. In Congress, lawmakers say they want to use piecemeal legislation to address specific issues. There is stiff political resistance among Republicans to voting on one, sweeping legislative package. The Affordable Care Act was 2,700 pages, and Republicans these days are generally distrustful of behemoth bills. They are too hard to explain to the public; their constituents hate them; and it's too easy to tuck in provisions they might regret voting for down the road. Republicans have promised to keep intact some of the more popular provisions of the law. They say people with pre-existing conditions will still have access to health insurance, and that parents can keep their adult children on their health plans until age 26. House Republicans offered a broad outline for reform in 2016 that provides the foundation for what they will try and do this year. That plan repeals the individual mandate, which is a pillar of Obamacare. Instead, it would create new tax credits to incentivize individuals to buy insurance, but it wouldn't penalize them if they don't. Ryan discussed this at a CNN town hall on Thursday. \"We want to instead have tax credits, so that everybody can ... take their tax credit and go buy a health care plan of their choosing,\" he said. \"And that's the other thing \u2014 we don't want to make people buy something that they don't want to buy. We don't want to force them to buy all these different benefits.\" There is also loose consensus in the House and Senate to remove mandates on essential health benefits that insurance plans must cover and let states decide minimum coverage. Republicans also plan to use the repeal legislation to cut off funds for Planned Parenthood, which received federal funds through Medicaid reimbursements for services. Planned Parenthood is a political target for Republicans, who oppose the health care provider, because they provide abortion services. Instead, Republicans want to redirect those federal funds to health clinics that do not offer abortion services. What Don't We know? A lot. Broadly, there is a philosophical debate here about whether the federal government has an obligation to insure all Americans, or whether Americans should decide whether or not to have insurance. Republicans have pledged that no one who has insurance through the ACA will lose it, but without a mandate the number of insured Americans could drop. The other major challenge facing Republicans is cost. The party, at its core, is resistant to expanding federal entitlements and spending, but they have pledged to create better health care coverage options at lower costs. Those two promises are hard to reconcile, particularly for a legislative product that will have to be assessed by the Congressional Budget Office for its impact on the federal budget. Lawmakers say the most ambitious timetable to see a legislative product take shape is late February, although others caution that this debate could consume most of 2017. For all the Republicans' ambitions on health care, there are still certain legislative realities they have to face. The most significant is in the Senate, where replacement legislation will likely need to pass a 60-vote hurdle, and that means bringing some combination of Democrats on board. That's why GOP senators are taking a more measured approach. For instance, Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee chairman, Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., a key negotiator, has already taken Medicare off the table as part of any health care negotiations, because it would repel any Democrat from engaging in talks. What are the political calculations? Democrats advanced Obamacare after winning an election that delivered control of Congress and the White House. In hindsight, many top Democrats have reflected that the party tackled health care when the country was really aching for economic relief. \"Americans were crying out for an end to the recession, for better wages and more jobs; not for changes in their healthcare,\" Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., reflected in 2014. Arguably, Republicans could be making the same mistake. The party is fresh off an election victory that delivered unified GOP control for the first time in a decade. But their dire warnings about Obamacare don't always line up with the public's view of the law. A recent NPR/Ipsos poll showed 38% of Americans support strengthening or expanding Obamacare; 31% want it repealed and replaced; 14% want it repealed and not replaced; 6% want it left as is. Democrats think Republicans have over-played their hand. \"When you put pen to paper, all hell is going to break lose on your side,\" Rep. Peter Welch, D-Vt., said during floor debate this week on the budget resolution, \"because you have to move beyond the rhetoric to figuring out how you're going to pay to keep our kids on our health care plan, figuring out how to have to pay if we're going to let folks with pre-existing conditions have health care. Those (problems) don't solve themselves, and you don't have a plan.\" But doing nothing is also not an option, particularly for lawmakers in states where premiums are rising and insurer options are now down to a single provider. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky argued that Democrats face their own political risks by defending the current system. \"I would caution our Democratic friends to become the spokesmen for the status quo,\" he said. \"It associates them with the fact that, after Obamacare, there's still 25 million Americans who are uninsured, co-payments are going up, deductibles are going up and premiums are going up. I would also remind them that (Obamacare) is the reason we had a great year in 2010, 2014 and again in 2016.\"",

STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Hillary Clinton is talking about Comey. The defeated presidential candidate took questions onstage at an event yesterday. Christiane Amanpour asked about the election, and Clinton blamed her defeat in part on Russia and FBI Director James Comey. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) HILLARY CLINTON: I was on the way to winning until the combination of Jim Comey's letter on October 28 and Russian WikiLeaks raised doubts in the minds of people who were inclined to vote for me but got scared off. INSKEEP: Remember, Comey's letter saying the FBI was looking into some more emails. This morning, the FBI director might have a chance to get his say if he's asked about it. Comey will be before the Senate Judiciary Committee, although the hearing is supposed to be about something else. MARTIN: OK. NPR national security correspondent Mary Louise Kelly is up first with us this morning. Hi, Mary Louise. MARY LOUISE KELLY, BYLINE: Good morning, Rachel. MARTIN: What is this particular hearing about? What do senators want to know on the Judiciary Committee from James Comey? KELLY: Well, Rachel, in case living through the 2016 campaign once wasn't enough for you, Jim Comey is going to get to do it again. He will get questions about the FBI generally. He may get asked about this Hillary Clinton... MARTIN: This is a regular check-in. KELLY: This is a regular oversight hearing. However, as tends to happen lately on the Hill, it's likely to be all Russia all the time. The chair of the committee that he's before today is Senator Chuck Grassley. And Grassley has a bee in his bonnet about the Trump-Russia dossier, which we haven't talked about in a while. You may have recalled, this is the one everybody was talking about a couple months ago that alleges that Russia has all kinds of dirt on Donald Trump. Grassley... MARTIN: And that there had been collusion is what this dossier... KELLY: And that there had been collusion. And Grassley has questions - everybody has questions - but Grassley has written a letter, which I am looking at right now, Rachel, asking questions about the relationship between the guy who wrote this dossier - this is the former MI6 officer, Christopher Steele - and the FBI. And so it is safe to say - he fired off a letter to Comey on Friday demanding answers. Safe to say he'll be pushing for them today. MARTIN: Tomorrow, there's going to be yet another hearing on Capitol Hill. Right? This one is going to be behind closed doors, which is where they can talk about classified material and presumably get closer to real answers. KELLY: Right. Comey is back in the hot seat tomorrow before the House Intelligence Committee. There are a lot of committees on the Hill looking into this, but it's the intelligence committees that have the lead. So tomorrow, House Intelligence Committee - Comey, also the head of the National Security Agency, Mike Rogers. But there are a lot more hearings to come. I mean, I think we are in the settle-in-and-pop-some-popcorn phase. MARTIN: And there is a sense of urgency here. I mean - we've interviewed people who've said, oh, we're going to take as much time as we need. But they can't take forever on this. KELLY: No. Because there are more elections coming. So if the point of all of this is to figure out what Russia did and to stop Russia from doing it again, there's a gubernatorial race coming up in Virginia in the fall. INSKEEP: And worth remembering - one of the reasons we're still talking about this is because we still don't know some answers and because it's a democracy where nothing is ever over. This is, you know, like \"Homeland\" or - name your series - \"House Of Cards.\" There's always going to be another episode or another layer to dig down on this story. MARTIN: NPR's Mary Louise Kelly helping us do that digging - as always, thanks so much, Mary Louise. KELLY: You're very welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF ZOE KEATING'S \"LOST\") MARTIN: And we're going to say on Capitol Hill where Republicans, Steve, are having to do a bit of compromising these days. INSKEEP: And lawmakers formally vote today on a spending agreement. It's the deal that kept the government open and avoided a shutdown the other day. Some Republicans think they agreed to a little too much. Here's Senator Lindsey Graham on CNN. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"AT THIS HOUR\") LINDSEY GRAHAM: I think the... KATE BOLDUAN: Why? GRAHAM: ...Democrats cleaned our clock. I think the, you know - there are things in this bill that I just don't understand. This was not winning from the Republican point of view. INSKEEP: What happened here was the bill required some Democratic votes, and so it did require compromise. Democrats got a variety of items, like more money for the arts, more spending on health care, Pell Grants for college. MARTIN: Compromise - something that doesn't happen that often anymore on Capitol Hill. INSKEEP: No, not that often. MARTIN: NPR's political editor Domenico Montanaro is with us in-studio. Good morning, Domenico. DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Good morning, Rachel. MARTIN: OK. This spending bill - President Trump didn't get funding for a wall. He didn't get any of the big cuts to domestic programs he'd been pushing. Planned Parenthood is still funded. So what did he get? MONTANARO: Well, he did get more military spending. He did get another million - another billion and a half - excuse me - for border security, fixing fencing, more technology, sensors. The Immigrations and Customs Enforcement Agency got more money. Customs and Border Patrol got more money. So there were things that did get some more funding that President Trump had wanted for some of his priorities, but there were also things that Democrats liked. You know, Steve mentioned the Pell Grants increases. The EPA Clean Water program was left intact. E-cigarettes are going to be subject to FDA review, something some Republicans wanted to stop. And Democrats stopped deep EPA cuts. So a lot of things that both sides had to give in on and you saw, like you said, some compromise. MARTIN: Well, but isn't - so is that an outright - when we heard Lindsey Graham there... MONTANARO: Of course not (laughter). MARTIN: ...Feeling like it's not - but at the same time, it's a compromise. Isn't that what they're supposed to do? Isn't that governance? MONTANARO: I mean, the big win for everybody was the fact that the government stayed open, although you had President Trump tweet yesterday that he was encouraging moving from the 60-vote threshold in the Senate to 51 votes in the Senate so that he could get more of what he wanted because he said, the reason we had to give in so many things is because we had to work with Democrats. So instead, he said, you know, the country needs a good shutdown come September. INSKEEP: A nuclear, nuclear, nuclear option. MARTIN: OK. So let's pivot to health care - because why not? We always do, it feels like. Republicans are trying again to replace Obamacare. It doesn't look like, at this point, they have the votes they need. MONTANARO: No. They still don't have the votes. They didn't have the votes yesterday. If they had the votes, they would bring it to the floor. So Republicans still are trying to corral the votes. They are some, you know, half a dozen - maybe a little fewer, maybe a little - more short of the goal they need to be able to get that through. Of course, that's a big priority for President Trump and something that they've now pledged to do before moving on to tax reform. MARTIN: So Democrats must be feeling a little more emboldened these days. MONTANARO: They are a little more emboldened. But let's remember, life in the minority in Congress is not fun. INSKEEP: Can I just remember something that the president said some weeks ago about the health care debate? And I'm paraphrasing here because you can't quote him directly. Don't worry about the little stuff, essentially was the quote. Don't worry about the little stuff. Just get this bill passed. It's hard to believe this president really cares that much about the details of his spending bill as long as some business gets done and the fight goes on. I'm sure he would like to pass some kind of health care legislation and maybe still doesn't particularly care what it is. MARTIN: NPR political editor Domenico Montanaro helping us sort this out this morning. Thanks, Domenico. MONTANARO: Thank you. MARTIN: And we have a question to keep an eye on today. Steve? INSKEEP: The question is - what will the Justice Department do after a shooting in Baton Rouge, La.? The killing of Alton Sterling, you may recall, was part of a string of violent incidents involving police in 2016. Numerous news outlets say federal authorities have decided not to charge the officers involved, although NPR News has yet to independently confirm this. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MARTIN: And our final story has to do with international law. We're going to talk about the Geneva Convention. INSKEEP: Yeah, which set standards for humanitarian treatment during war. The rules - they're supposed to be laws of war here - they include protections for hospitals. Yet a new study says hospitals are targeted in war zones around the world - not very surprising if you've listen to NPR News. We've heard from people in Syria whose facilities were targeted. And the Bloomberg School of Health at Johns Hopkins studied that very country, saying that more than 100 health facilities were attacked last year in Syria alone, despite a United Nations plan to protect them. MARTIN: So NPR's Jason Beaubien has been doing some reporting on this, and he's with us now. Good morning, Jason. JASON BEAUBIEN, BYLINE: Hey. Good morning. MARTIN: What was in that that U.N. plan? BEAUBIEN: So basically the U.N. Security Council - it was exactly a year ago today - passed another resolution because they were saying there's this incredible prevailing impunity, they said, for attacks on hospitals. And they were saying that member states need to really step it up and conduct independent investigations when attacks like this happen. MARTIN: So that wasn't happening, nation-states weren't investigating after a hospital... BEAUBIEN: I mean, that is part of the problem. Right? There's this international law saying this is a horrific thing to do - to bomb a hospital or to attack health care workers or for gunmen to come in and, you know, yank people out of hospital beds. But trying to enforce that is incredibly difficult, and there's not, you know, this sort of mechanism that can go in and investigate. And so they're saying, member states should take that on, and they are the ones that should do it. But it's the member states that actually are accused of carrying out these attacks that are considered responsible for investigating themselves as to whether or not this happened. And as you can guess, that hasn't gone incredibly well. You know, this new report gets into some of the details on some of - it doesn't try to look at absolutely every attack. But it did look at some of the documentation that's out there and found that, you know, as you might suspect, not that many of these are actually leading to anyone being prosecuted, being held accountable. And that's what the problem was in the first place. MARTIN: It's also hard to discern if these attacks - some of them - they may have claimed to have been mistakes, others directly targeted. BEAUBIEN: Yeah, absolutely. So it's a huge problem, and it's sort of this outrage of war. People are trying to do something about it. MARTIN: Yeah. BEAUBIEN: But what we're seeing is that not much is actually getting done. INSKEEP: The old phrase is total war. And in Syria, that's what it is. BEAUBIEN: Yeah. MARTIN: NPR's Jason Beaubien. Hey, Jason, thanks so much for sharing your reporting on this. BEAUBIEN: You're welcome. Copyright \u00a9 2017 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "Ohio was key to President Trump's victory in November, and his base of support there among the Tea Party and other loyalists is holding, even amid internal White House battles, the failure to repeal Obamacare and some big reversals of campaign promises. But these voters also make clear they have expectations by which they will judge the president.  AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: Ohio was key to President Trump's victory in November. He succeeded in flipping 10 counties that had gone for President Obama four years earlier. NPR's Don Gonyea recently went back to Ohio to check in on Trump supporters as their candidate nears his 100th day in office. They're still loyal but expect to see some results. DON GONYEA, BYLINE: Two days after the election, I walked into the Top Notch Diner in Trumbull County, Ohio, and found a group of regulars talking politics, all Trump supporters - among them, 64-year-old Gary Frederick, who owns the diner. He expected the Trump victory to lead to the quick demise of the Affordable Care Act, Obamacare. That didn't happen, but he doesn't blame Trump. GARY FREDERICK: Well, that... GONYEA: What was your take on that? FREDERICK: That's more of Congress, not Trump's doing. GONYEA: Recently I went back to the diner where Frederick says he still sees Trump as making good progress. FREDERICK: Trump's a businessman. He knows what has to be done to make things right, and he's already making it happen. The trade policies - bringing all them, like, China, Japan - all them people in, and he's sitting down with them. GONYEA: But Trump has already reversed some big campaign promises on trade. This week he told Canada and Mexico he won't be tearing up NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement. And he's decided not to label China a currency manipulator. Frederick's take on that... FREDERICK: I think there's a backdoor going on there. And Trump don't lay his cards on the table for everybody to see. GONYEA: It's breakfast time at the Top Notch Diner, and the regulars are gathering like they do most mornings. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: Two eggs, toast, home fries and meat for 3.95. GONYEA: The topic of China comes up. 79-year-old Dave Cover, a former truck driver, says it's evidence of Trump adapting to the job. Trump needs China, he says, because he needs help with North Korea. DAVE COVER: He's come to the conclusion that he has to deal with China 'cause that's the only effective ally that's got any control over basically an uncontrollable entity over there. And he's decided, in my opinion, we've got to make hay with China because of North Korea. GONYEA: Seated next to Cover is Doyle Smithson, a retired firefighter. He rejects the notion that it's anywhere near time to pass judgment on the president. DOYLE SMITHSON: What does the first hundred days have to do with it? He's elected for four years. GONYEA: Tell him the president himself has touted a successful 100 days, and Smithson says, again... SMITHSON: He's got four years. GONYEA: Now to another northeast Ohio town - Strongsville, a suburb of Cleveland - and to Jane Porter. She's a Tea Party member. JANE PORTER: Well, I think that he has very good intentions, and I think that he wants to do the things that he promised. GONYEA: If she sounds just a bit lacking in enthusiasm, she says that's not so and offers an alternative reality. PORTER: What I would say is, I could be doing an interview with you today - you know, if Hillary were in, it would be, you know, pretty much everything that we fear upon us. GONYEA: Porter has high expectations for what Trump and a GOP-controlled Congress should do. Trump has won praise from conservatives for naming Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. But Porter says there's no real certainty yet how he will vote on the issue most important to her, abortion. And she says a new law allowing states to withhold federal funding for Planned Parenthood is not enough. PORTER: If he thinks that allowing the states to defund Planned Parenthood is going to, you know, appease us - no. GONYEA: Now to a small lake not far from Akron, Ohio. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: Oh, come on (laughter). TOM ZAWISTOWSKI: Yeah, come on up the spiral staircase. This spiral staircase was made in my home town of Erie, Pa., and I... GONYEA: Northeast Ohio Tea Party leader Tom Zawistowski lives in a house that has a lighthouse attached. He likes that Trump is a businessman and a pragmatist, but he also acknowledges that means the Tea Party needs to be vigilant. ZAWISTOWSKI: We knew he wasn't a conservative, so we knew that once he got to Washington, we kind of had to be the guard rails on the highway, OK? He's going to be all over the road. We just need to make sure he doesn't drive off the road. GONYEA: Here's an example of that. When Trump tweeted attacks on the Freedom Caucus after that group derailed the Obamacare replacement, Zawistowski wrote an open letter to the president, reminding him that the Tea Party helped him get elected. ZAWISTOWSKI: We're good at keeping score, you know? We've had to do this. GONYEA: Again, he's still a strong supporter, but it's not unconditional. ZAWISTOWSKI: He likes to be liked. He likes to be loved, OK? Well, you know, there's a - that's a two-way street. You know, show us some love, too. GONYEA: So close to the 100-day mark of the Trump presidency - support from his voters, but it's an ongoing relationship and one that will be tested. Don Gonyea, NPR News, Akron, Ohio.

            "article_content": "Republicans and Democrats in Congress reached a bipartisan deal late on Sunday to fund the federal government for the rest of the fiscal year. But bigger challenges lie ahead this fall.  KELLY MCEVERS, HOST: Republicans might control Congress, but Democrats are pretty happy right now. That's because of a $1.1 trillion spending deal. The deal cut by congressional leaders means no government shutdown. And to learn more about it and the politics that go with it, we are going to talk to NPR congressional correspondent Susan Davis. Hey, Sue. SUSAN DAVIS, BYLINE: Hey, Kelly. MCEVERS: Why are Democrats so happy about this deal? DAVIS: Well, they're happy about what's not in the bill. It does not include most of what the Trump administration initially asked for. There's no money in here to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. There is none of President Trump's proposed cuts to domestic programs. And there are no what we call poison pills. They're, like, controversial policy riders on issues that have been of common fight in the past like prohibiting money from going to Planned Parenthood. None of that is in there. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer today talked to reporters, and he said the deal is sort of proof that Democrats can still matter when Republicans control Washington and that they could continue to have leverage in negotiations when their votes are necessary to pass legislation. And that's important 'cause this is a dynamic we will likely see again this year and potentially sooner rather than later because Congress will have to do this all over again by the end of September. MCEVERS: What do Republicans think about the bill? I mean did they get anything in return? DAVIS: You know, avoiding a shutdown when you control government (laughter) itself is a bit of a win. And the White House has indicated President Trump will sign it when it reaches his desk. What this bill does, remember, is it essentially does - funds most of the functions of the federal government. And most of that has bipartisan support. And there's new money in here for things like cancer research and fighting the opioid epidemic. So that's stuff that's pretty popular across the board. There's a lot for lawmakers to be happy about in here. Republicans' big win is they got more money for the Pentagon, for defense spending, and they got it without having to spend more money on domestic programs. That sort of dollar-for-dollar increase principle has been a fixture of past negotiations with Democrats, and since it didn't apply this time, Republicans say this is also a good sign for them that they can reach a deal when they have to do this again in September. This bill is only good for five months 'cause Congress was supposed to do this last September, but lawmakers couldn't reach a deal in the height of election season, so it got punted into the first 100 days or the first 102 days, as it may be. MCEVERS: Right. The Trump administration has said that they're going to try next year in the spending bills to get money for the border wall, and the White House also wants $54 billion in spending cuts. What are the chances for that to happen? DAVIS: It's really steep. Although I would say the White House has indicated that that September fight over next year's funding is where the real clash is going to be. But the leverage Democrats had this time doesn't really change next time. You know, the administration's still going to need their votes to pass these bills, and Democrats are - remain unanimously opposed to things like the border wall, as do several Republicans - is worth noting. So - and many of those spending cuts the president has outlined are dead on arrival. One good example is that - is the proposal to cut the State Department's budget by about a third. Republicans led by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell have made clear that that's not going to happen. The big question is, how willing is President Trump willing to go to force a government shutdown this fall if Congress isn't willing to fund his priorities or cut his priorities, as the case may be? MCEVERS: Congress will vote on the spending deal this week. But what about the Republicans' health care bill? DAVIS: Yeah. MCEVERS: Are they any closer to a vote on that this week? DAVIS: As of today, it remains unlikely this week. The math, the momentum still aren't there. As of today, there's about 22 Republicans publicly opposed to it, and that is the maximum number leaders can lose and still pass the bill because every Democrat in the House is opposed to it. Another 50 or so Republicans haven't made clear where they are on the bill. The core of the opposition is coming from lawmakers in more moderate districts who don't support a controversial amendment that they say could weaken the preexisting conditions under current law. The White House keeps insisting they got a vote this week, but they don't really get a say on that. And Republican leaders still saying they're not going to bring it to the floor unless they know it can pass. MCEVERS: NPR's Susan Davis on Capitol Hill, thank you. DAVIS: You bet.

            "article_content": "Supporters and opponents of abortion rights are reacting to President Trump's pick of Neil Gorsuch for the Supreme Court. The pick was the culmination of a promise Trump made to social conservatives.  RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: When President Donald Trump stood up last night to introduce his Supreme Court nominee, he reminded the audience just how important this issue had been to his campaign. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Millions of voters said this was the single most important issue to them when they voted for me for president. I am a man of my word. MARTIN: Trump's choice of Neil Gorsuch is the culmination of a promise he made to social conservatives. As NPR's Sarah McCammon reports, both supporters and opponents of Gorsuch are watching the future of the court closely. SARAH MCCAMMON, BYLINE: One of the big ways Trump won over conservative, religious voters was by promising to pick Supreme Court justices who would restrict abortion rights and protect religious freedom. With the nomination of Gorsuch, many social conservatives feel they're getting what they were betting on. Marjorie Dannenfelser is president of the anti-abortion Susan B. Anthony List. MARJORIE DANNENFELSER: We're very excited. This nomination was really the top priority for the entire election. MCCAMMON: Exit polls in November suggested the makeup of the court was a major motivator for many people and a factor that swung in Trump's favor. In one poll, 56 percent of voters who said Supreme Court appointments were their most important factor voted for Trump. Like many abortion rights opponents, replacing the late Justice Antonin Scalia with another conservative judge was a top goal for Dannenfelser, who served on an advisory group Trump called his pro-life coalition. But Dannenfelser says she doesn't see Roe v. Wade going anywhere right away. DANNENFELSER: We're getting back to - with our position last summer before Justice Scalia died. But we are certainly one step closer to filling the next seat. MCCAMMON: Another member of Trump's pro-life coalition, evangelical leader Ralph Reed, was at the White House for the announcement last night. RALPH REED: This is not my first rodeo, so I know now comes the hard part, which is the confirmation process. But I think President Trump fulfilled a major campaign promise. MCCAMMON: Reproductive rights advocates are also gearing up for that process. Gorsuch has a history of siding with religious liberty claims from companies like Hobby Lobby, which objected to the contraceptive coverage requirement in the Affordable Care Act. Emily Stewart, policy director at Planned Parenthood, says the organization will fight any attempt to roll back abortion rights. EMILY STEWART: We are deeply concerned. Neil Gorsuch has an alarming history of interfering with reproductive rights and health and there has never been a more important Supreme Court nomination. MCCAMMON: President Trump is making the first of what could be several picks on an aging Supreme Court at a time when the nation is bitterly divided on abortion and other social issues, raising the stakes even higher.

While the spending bill is expected to pass, Republicans don't have the votes yet to pass a new health care bill.  RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: Republicans on Capitol Hill are having to do a bit of compromising today. Lawmakers will formally vote on a spending agreement. It's the deal that kept the government open and avoided a total shutdown of the government. Some Republicans think they agreed to a little too much, though. Here's Senator Lindsey Graham talking on CNN. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LINDSEY GRAHAM: I think the Democrats cleaned our clock. I think that - you know, there are things in this bill that I just don't understand. This was not winning from the Republican point of view.

NPR's political editor Domenico Montanaro is in the studio this morning. Hi, Domenico. DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Hey, there Rachel. MARTIN: So this spending bill, President Trump didn't get funding for the wall. He didn't get big cuts to domestic programs he'd been talking about. Planned Parenthood is still funded. So what did he get? MONTANARO: Well, regardless of the president's budget director going to the White House Briefing Room - excuse me - yesterday with big pictures that showed the fence - a border fence and claiming a victory for border funding, they did not get border funding, border wall funding, that is. MARTIN: Yeah. MONTANARO: They did get an increase in military funding. They got an increase in border security and some fence fixes. And they got money that bars - or they were - they barred money for Gitmo detainee transfer. So some of that, they got some of what they want. But at the same time, Democrats got some things that they liked. There is no cuts to Planned Parenthood. They got money for NIH, Pell Grants, arts funding, Amtrak. The EPA was largely left alone. And if you like those e-cigarettes, they're going to be subjected to FDA review. MARTIN: So this was a compromise. Is that just good government - good governance? I mean... MONTANARO: Well, potentially, but it seems like something set Donald Trump off yesterday because somebody either was on cable TV or something where he saw Democrats, quote, \"spiking the football,\" and he got upset about it, said that - even talked about potentially changing the filibuster rule so that to advance legislation, you need 60 votes in the Senate. He's tried to say, well, maybe we'll cut that back to 50 votes - 50 votes - only 51 votes. And then in the fall, maybe we need a shutdown so that he could get some more of his priorities through. MARTIN: Let's move to health care. Republicans are trying again to replace Obamacare. Doesn't look like they have the votes they need though at this point. MONTANARO: Nope, still the same bill that we've been talking about. They don't have the votes at this point. If they had the votes, they would bring it to the floor. MARTIN: I want to talk about a presidential candidate, former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton because she made a rare public appearance yesterday, making her most extensive comments since the election about what happened in the campaign. Let's listen to this clip. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) HILLARY CLINTON: I was on the way to winning until the combination of Jim Comey's letter on October 28 and Russian WikiLeaks raised doubts in the minds of people who were inclined to vote for me but got scared off. MARTIN: Placing blame on the Russians, on Jim Comey. We're still litigating this election. MONTANARO: You know, in the NPR Politics podcast, we have a thing at the end that we do called Can't Let It Go. And it seems like for Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, the election is the thing they both can't let go. You have Donald Trump continuing to talk about the fact that he won all these electoral votes. He even created this firestorm because he said that, you know, he would have won the popular vote or maybe did falsely because 3 million illegal votes were cast. And, of course, that never happened. MARTIN: OK, so staying on this theme of presidential campaigns that never end... MONTANARO: I know. I know where you're going. MARTIN: ...The first presidential campaign ad for 2020 ran yesterday, believe it or not... MONTANARO: It has happened. MARTIN: ...At least in some markets. Let's listen to this. (SOUNDBITE OF POLITICAL AD) UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Donald Trump, sworn in as president 100 days ago. America has rarely seen such success. MARTIN: A presidential campaign ad running in May, years before the race? MONTANARO: America, rarely seen such success, Rachel. Look. This is a remarkable moment. We saw CNN decided that it was not going to run this ad because it had the false, you know, claim that there's - that the mainstream media is fake news. You know, it's not even clear, you know, what the rationale is for running or not running it. I mean, we're not even near a campaign at this point. MARTIN: So CNN's saying it's not a campaign ad technically. MONTANARO: It's not a campaign yet. MARTIN: So it can't be an ad. MONTANARO: So, you know, as far as the FCC goes, the Federal Communications Commission, Trump is not really a candidate yet. He hasn't announced his candidacy. He can't qualify for any ballots yet. So that is, you know, we are already in the campaign it seems. And our elections already go on too long. And people pay far too much attention to presidential elections. And it looks like we're already there. Even Joe Biden was in New Hampshire a couple days ago. MARTIN: Make it stop. MONTANARO: (Laughter). MARTIN: NPR's Domenico Montanaro. Thanks so much, Domenico.

While supporters of Donald Trump prepare for Friday's inauguration, so, too, are thousands of protesters. Several dozen attended a training session this past weekend, run by a group called DisruptJ20. The group opposes just about everything the incoming administration stands for. Its goal is to disrupt, if not stop, Trump's inauguration. Trainer Robby Diesu has everyone line up with a partner to show how it can be done nonviolently. He tells one side to be the protesters and the others to pretend they're Trump supporters \u2014 \"who just drove eight hours to get here and to see President Trump become president, and you've come upon a protest that is preventing you from getting there,\" he says. \"So, ready, set, go!\" Things quickly deteriorate as \"protesters\" and \"Trump supporters\" start yelling at each other, and even shoving. Diesu gives the group tips on how to de-escalate a tense situation. First lower your voice, he advises, and never touch your adversary. He also says to try to be calm, and keep your hands in front of you so no one thinks you're hiding anything, like a weapon. DisruptJ20 plans to blockade or protest at every security checkpoint along the Inaugural Parade route. Many here are antsy about going public and won't share their full names, as the group has received a number of online threats. Kate is with a group promoting LGBTQ rights that plans to dance, spread glitter and hand out rainbow flags at one of the checkpoints. \"[We're] showing people who are trying to attend the inauguration that we're not going away,\" she says. She adds that protesters want to make clear that they'll fight efforts to repeal laws protecting their rights. This will likely be one of dozens of protests around the city. Anti-war groups will gather along the parade route. Thousands of pro-Trump supporters will be there as well. One group, Bikers for Trump, has warned that they'll form a \"wall of meat\" to prevent protesters from spoiling the event, which has raised some concerns about violent confrontations. But at least one inaugural protest promises to be very mellow. Adam Eidinger and several volunteers have been rolling piles of marijuana into cigarettes in his dining room in Washington, D.C. They plan to hand out 4,200 joints (\"420\" is code for smoking marijuana) for free on Inauguration Day. Volunteers roll marijuana in joints they plan to hand out for free on Inauguration Day. They're suggesting people light up four minutes and 20 seconds into Trump's Inaugural address to make a statement, although it's illegal to do it outside.\n                \n                    \n                    Pam Fessler/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Volunteers roll marijuana in joints they plan to hand out for free on Inauguration Day. They're suggesting people light up four minutes and 20 seconds into Trump's Inaugural address to make a statement, although it's illegal to do it outside. Eidinger is with DC Cannabis Coalition, which led a successful effort to get home use of marijuana legalized in the District. They don't want the new administration to turn back the legalization gains made here and elsewhere in recent years. So after the give-away, they're suggesting people light up four minutes and 20 seconds into Trump's Inaugural address to make a statement, although it's illegal to do it outside. \"It's actually saying, we're here, we're a community, we're not going to be cowered. We just won eight out of nine ballot initiatives as a community in this last election cycle. We're more popular than either one of the two presidential candidates in all the public opinion polling,\" Eidinger says. \"Why are you still putting us in jail?\" This week's biggest protest won't be on Inauguration Day itself, but the day after, when the Women's March on Washington is expected to attract some 200,000 people from around the country. Carmen Perez is one of the organizers of the Women's March on Washington.\n                \n                    \n                    Pam Fessler/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Carmen Perez is one of the organizers of the Women's March on Washington. \"We're going to have musical performances. We're going to have spoken word. There are some people that have been working with us in the movement for quite some time that will be on that stage performing. We'll have gospels,\" says Carmen Perez, one of the organizers. Perez says more than a protest against Trump, the march is a chance for women to show their political clout. After the rally, they'll march a mile and a half, probably toward the White House. Many participants have said they fear that things they care about \u2014 like reproductive rights and racial equality \u2014 are threatened by both the new administration and Congress. Perez says the initial goal is to be heard. \"If they don't continue to listen to us and if they're trying to take away some of our rights, we'll come back,\" she says. Like the other protesters, she says they're not going away, that this is the beginning not the end.",

            "article_content": "Science, women's rights, human rights, LGBT rights, and minority rights are just a few of the issues that were reasons people chose to attend the women's marches across the country on Saturday.  MICHEL MARTIN, HOST: Today is President Donald Trump's first full day in office. In a few minutes, we'll hear what the president has been doing. That includes a controversial visit to the CIA. But we're going to spend some time hearing about those massive women's marches that have been taking place all day. Women and, yes, many men, and even children flocked to marches in Washington, D.C., Los Angeles, New York and Chicago, among other cities. And there were marches overseas in places like Paris, Delhi and Bangkok. The purpose, they say, is to take a stand for women's rights and against Donald Trump's agenda, as well as the tone they say the new president is setting for the country. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DONNA HILTON: This march is about us, the people, the women in this country, who refuse to be marginalized, sexualized and abused and silenced. March. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ELIZABETH WARREN: Now, we can whimper, we can whine, or we can fight back. Me, I'm here to fight back. MARTIN: Those were the voices of Donna Hilton, an activist in Washington, D.C., and Senator Elizabeth Warren. She was in Boston. We're going to take a quick trip around the country now to hear more about this. NPR's Pam Fessler is here in Washington, D.C. NPR's Ina Jaffe is in Los Angeles. And Sarah Boden of Iowa Public Radio joins us from Des Moines. Welcome to you all. PAM FESSLER, BYLINE: Hi. SARAH BODEN, BYLINE: Hello. INA JAFFE, BYLINE: Hi. MARTIN: So Pam Fessler, let's start with you. What was the scene today on the National Mall in Washington? FESSLER: There were just thousands and thousands and thousands of women, and they were very energized. A lot of them were wearing those pink caps, a lot of - carrying signs - my body, my choice, fight like a girl. The signs were very strident, but the mood there was very, very festive. And I was there yesterday at the inauguration. It was a very different mood. MARTIN: Now, tell us about some of the things that people said - the people that you interviewed. What was on their minds? FESSLER: A lot of them said they were very energized by their dissatisfaction with the election results, and they wanted to make sure - make it clear to political leaders, Donald Trump and others, that there are a lot of people in this country who care very deeply about protecting women's rights and reproductive rights, immigration rights, LGBT rights. One woman I spoke to - her name is Kyndall Rodriguez - she was with a group of young women, all women of color, who are law students. And she said that, you know, she feels that every day women are belittled and demeaned and that they're disrespected. KYNDALL RODRIGUEZ: I'm sick of it, personally. So I came out here with other educated women to come together because, personally, I think I'm a woman first. UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTER: (Screaming). RODRIGUEZ: So I march for women. I march for minority rights. And people like... UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTERS: (Chanting) No more violence, no more hate. RODRIGUEZ: ...Donald Trump, they don't respect women. MARTIN: As we said, these demonstrations are taking place all over the country. So let's go to Des Moines, Iowa, now where Sarah Boden is. Sarah, what's it like in Des Moines? BODEN: Again, just like Pam said, very festive. People seem to be determined to take a more active role in the democracy. Some people said - I spoke to one woman who told me that, you know, I've - maybe I got a little too relaxed under the Obama administration and I didn't follow through my duty - with my duties as a citizen. And, you know, I'm trying to step up and be more engaged now. MARTIN: Now, Iowa as a state, went for Donald Trump by a pretty large margin - almost 10 points. Now, you pointed out that a lot of the demonstrators said that they felt that they had not been as active as they could have been or should have been. Did the rally there reflect that? Did some of the demonstrators say - are there - say that they were there in part to renew their commitment to their own politics? BODEN: People were saying that they wanted to be more involved with this democracy and that they felt like they had to make their voice heard so that the rights that had been gained under, not only the Obama administration, but, you know, decades, centuries passed, will still be here in the future. They're worried that under a Donald Trump presidency progress that has been made will be rewound. MARTIN: So let's go to the West Coast now where NPR's Ina Jaffe is in Los Angeles. So, Ina, what's standing out to you there? JAFFE: It - I've never seen so many people in one place in Los Angeles in my life, and that includes sold-out Dodger Stadium. When they marched from Pershing Square, which is where the first part of the rally was, to City Hall, which was where the second part of the rally was, one street could not contain them. There were essentially three separate marches on parallel streets and moving just inch by inch. It was like everyone was still on the train platform just squished together. And it was an amazing mood of a combination of angry and joyful at the same time because people were really very kind to each other, very helpful with each other. People brought their children, even babies in strollers. And there were older people. Everybody, you know, got out of the way when they needed some room for canes and so forth. It was really a remarkable sight. MARTIN: Were there any particular issues that people highlighted to you there, Ina, or that you saw reflected in their signs? JAFFE: Well, certainly women's issues led. There were a lot of signs dealing with reproductive rights and Planned Parenthood, signs that said a woman's place is in the resistance with a picture of Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia from \"Star Wars.\" That was one of the things that people were really highlighting - men and women. But they also talked about, you know, women's rights are human rights. They talked about LGBT rights and minorities and religious freedom. And they were standing up for all those things that they say reflect the diversity of California. MARTIN: And finally, before we let you go Pam, one more question to you. We spent a couple of hours on the Mall earlier today, as well. And one of the things that we noted were a number of people talking about the importance of science. And I was surprised by that. And I wonder what you thought of that - many people saying that science is not a liberal conspiracy, science is truth and things of that sort. I wonder what you make of that. FESSLER: Well, I think there definitely were a lot of people there who were very interested in the climate and in the environment and want to make sure that there are not any turn backs in that area as well under the new administration. MARTIN: That was NPR's Pam Fessler here in Washington, D.C. We also heard from Sarah Boden of Iowa Public Radio in Des Moines and NPR's Ina Jaffe in Los Angeles. Thank you all so much for being with us. FESSLER: Thanks. JAFFE: You're welcome. BODEN: Thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2017 NPR.  All rights reserved.

The Handmaid's Tale by Margaret Atwood is one of a handful of dystopian novels that have seen a boost in sales since the 2016 election. The book tells the story of what happens when a theocratic dictatorship takes over the government and gets rid of women's rights. In 2016, Atwood told us that the idea started as a question: \"If you want women to go back into the home, how do you make them do that? And the method I proposed in 1985 was, now that we have credit cards, it's very easy to just cut off people's access to credit. And that's what happens in the book.\" That's also the premise of the TV adaptation of the book, now streaming on Hulu. In the imaginary Republic of Gilead, women are not allowed to own property or have bank accounts, and because of widespread infertility, those who have successfully had children are assigned to be Handmaids \u2014 bearing children for the rich and powerful. \"It was very important to us from the very beginning to make sure that people understood that this is present in a 'this could happen here' idea,\" says Elisabeth Moss, who stars as Offred. Samira Wiley plays Moira, Offred's best friend from \"before Gilead.\" She describes her character as a feminist in \"every way, shape or form.\" Moira (Samira Wiley, left) and Offred (Elisabeth Moss) are best friends \"before Gilead.\" In flashbacks, their world seems normal \u2014 they go for jogs, talk about Uber and Tinder, and organize protests.\n                \n                    \n                    George Kraychyk/Hulu\n                    \n                \nhide caption Moira (Samira Wiley, left) and Offred (Elisabeth Moss) are best friends \"before Gilead.\" In flashbacks, their world seems normal \u2014 they go for jogs, talk about Uber and Tinder, and organize protests. On Moira's reaction to her husband reassuring her that he will take care of her, after her bank account has been taken away Samira Wiley: It's not supposed to be an insult. ... It comes from a place of love, it comes from a place of wanting his wife to feel safe, but Moira is very, very sensitive to that language. ... She feels like she is standing up 100 percent for what she believes in and where women should be in the present. And if anyone comes even close to jeopardizing that, it is her responsibility to nip that in the bud. Elisabeth Moss: That scene, it's directly from the book and it really sets up this complexity of what is my husband supposed to say? The women now don't have access to any of their money and of course my husband loves me and just says what comes naturally which is: I'm going to take care of you. And of course that brings up the sensitive issue of, oh great, now I have to be taken care of. On women becoming a part of systems that hurt other women \u2014 for example, Aunt Lydia's character, who tells the Handmaids they are \"so lucky\" to serve powerful men and their barren wives Moss: It's another interesting thing raised by Margaret and by the show, which is: A really good way to control women is by using other women. And we also play the opposite, which is women, when they stand together, can be incredibly powerful. Ann Dowd plays Aunt Lydia and when she speaks about the character, from her perspective, she loves these girls. She believes she's actually doing a good deed and good service by protecting these women. And that's one of the things about the show is, we provide these different points of view and make these characters complex and not black and white. On the costumes \u2014 rich, married women wear green; barren aunt servants wear gray; Handmaids who are reproductive surrogates wear scarlet red and white bonnets Wiley: It highlights the differences between who I am and who the other is. It shows immediately how I am supposed to relate to someone. If I see a Handmaid who is of the same caste as I am, I know that we are equal. But ... if I see immediately that you are a wife, then I know how I am supposed to react. And that is just another way to have the oppression right on top of these women. On whether it feels weird to have real-life protesters donning Handmaid's Tale robes Moss: Not weird. Awesome. So, so, cool. This costume, this color, the bonnets \u2014 they're so iconic. And they stand immediately for feminism and women's rights. You take one look at that costume and you know what that girl is doing. You know why she's wearing it. And so, for me, seeing something like that is so incredibly moving. On the show underscoring the idea that there are different kinds of resistance Moss: I think that's one of the great things about it. There are many different ways of resistance, and all of them should be used. Marching, talking, conversation. Margaret has a quote that I love, which is: \"A word after a word after a word is power.\" And she also says: \"You can mean more than one. You can mean thousands.\" Wiley: I think that they are all valid. ... A television show, at the end of the day, can be art, and it can elicit real change. ... I just feel so blessed to be able to be a part of something that can elicit real change.

Monday on Today, Bush commented regarding developments in the nascent Trump presidency.\n                \n                    \n                    Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Former President George W. Bush and first lady Laura Bush arrive for Donald Trump's inauguration Jan. 20 at the U.S. Capitol. Monday on Today, Bush commented regarding developments in the nascent Trump presidency. It started out a simple, human interest story featuring a former president and his post-White House hobby \u2014 painting watercolors of world leaders, and now, portraits of American soldiers, wounded during military service. But before long, that president, George W. Bush, made real news by doing something he had never before done in a public forum since leaving office: discussing at length the current occupant of the Oval Office. Bush spoke on the set of NBC's Today show. Then, hours later, came an interview with People magazine, and more language that can only be seen as a careful critique \u2014 but still a critique \u2014 of the early days of the Donald Trump presidency. This is not just another president weighing in on public events and American politics. In fact, all through the Obama years, Bush avoided opining on questions about the policies of his successor. He held his tongue when Obama reversed his executive orders. He was quiet when Obama likened Bush-era policies to driving the car \"into the ditch.\" Bush once told CNN, \"It's a hard job. It's difficult. ... A former president doesn't need to make it any harder.\" In a speech in Canada just weeks into the Obama presidency, Bush told his audience he wouldn't spend his time criticizing Obama, \"and if he wants my help, he can pick up the phone and call me.\" Which brings us to NBC's Today on Monday morning. It was Bush's first interview since Donald Trump was sworn in as president. Bush was promoting his newest paintings, featuring the faces of wounded soldiers. They have been collected in a book called Portraits of Courage: A Commander in Chief's Tribute to America's Warriors. Host Matt Lauer started by asking about the division in the country following the brutal 2016 presidential campaign, and about how the transition to President Trump compared with when Bush took office after the controversial 2001 election. (In both cases, the loser of the popular vote won in the Electoral College.) Bush said it's hard to compare: \"One thing's for certain, though; the job's a tough job.\" But the former president did say that healing divisions requires a lot of people coming together to unite the country \u2014 the clear implication being that the president plays a role in that. Bush said that you have to take President Trump at his word that he wants to unify people. He also stressed that Trump has only been in office a little more than a month. Still, the 43rd President told People, \"I don't like the name-calling and I don't like the people feeling alienated.\" He added for emphasis, \"Nobody likes that.\" During his first month in the White House, President Trump has repeatedly hurled insults and attacks on news organizations. On Twitter and in speeches, labeling the media \"the enemy of the American people.\" Today's Matt Lauer noted that President Bush \u2014 who took the country to war in Iraq, and who presided over an economic crisis \u2014 faced plenty of criticism from the media while in office. Lauer asked Bush, \"Did you ever consider the media to be the enemy of the American people?\" Bush chuckled and then answered: \"I consider the media to be indispensable to democracy. We need an independent media to hold people like me to account. Power can be very addictive. And it can be corrosive. And it's important for the media to call to account people who abuse their power, whether it be here or elsewhere.\" Bush noted that he spent a lot of time trying to persuade Russian President Vladimir Putin to accept the notion of an independent press. That led to an exchange about the controversies involving Russia's alleged attempts to influence the 2016 presidential election, including reports of contacts between top Trump campaign officials and the Russians. Asked whether he would like a special prosecutor to look into the issue, Bush said: \"First of all, I think we all need answers \u2014 whether or not the special prosecutor is the way to go or not, you're talking to the wrong guy.\" Bush stressed that he is not a lawyer, so he wouldn't weigh in on the best approach, but on the reports about Russia and the election, he did say, \"I am sure, though, that that question needs to be answered.\" The discussion segued into talk of the days right after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, during Bush's first year in office. In the aftermath of that shocking, terrifying moment, Bush, as president, stressed to Muslims around the world that he had respect for their faith \u2014 a faith practiced by many Americans. He repeatedly made it a point to call the teachings of Islam good and peaceful. \"We are not at war against Islam,\" Bush would often say. Trump makes no such careful distinction, blasting the Obama White House and those who refuse to use the phrase \"radical Islamic terrorism.\" \"That's very different talk than what we're hearing today about a 'Muslim ban,'\" Lauer said. \"Do you think the president's position on this has been well thought out?\" Bush responded that the right to worship freely, or to not worship at all, is a bedrock of freedom in the U.S. \"You see, I understood right off the bat, Matt, that this is an ideological conflict, and people who murder the innocent are not religious people,\" Bush said. \"They want to advance an ideology, and we have faced those kinds of ideologues in the past.\" Asked point blank if he supports the ban on travel from the seven predominantly Muslim countries that were included in Trump's executive order, which is now being challenged in the courts, Bush said he is \"for an immigration policy that is welcoming and that upholds the law.\" In the conversation with People, Bush said \"I don't like the racism.\" The People interview, in Bush's painting studio at his Dallas home, was conducted by journalist Sandra Sobieraj Westfall, a former wire-service reporter who covered the Bush presidency. She asked if he would begin to speak out more, to take on some sort of leadership role. Bush responded that he won't be doing that. But his Presidential Library in Dallas is involved in the issues of the day. Here's a passage from the interview, where Bush describes the work he and former First Lady Laura Bush are doing: \"... at the Bush Center we are speaking up.\" The couple list some of the center's work that stands in contrast to Trump's isolationism: immigration ceremonies, women's reproductive-health programs in Africa, and leadership training for Muslim women that the Bush Center brings to Texas from the Middle East. Asked if Trump's determination to restrict immigration and travel from Muslim countries threatens the Bush Center programs, he shrugs. \"Now that you mention it, it might bother me but we'll figure out how to bring them over.\" \"There's a lot of ways to speak out,\" the former president says, \"but it's really through actions defending the values important to Laura and me. ... We're a blessed nation, and we ought to help others.\" In both interviews, Bush does stop short of direct and blunt criticism of Trump. But his willingness to engage on controversial, ongoing topics involving the White House \u2014 and a president of his own Republican Party \u2014 is a significant departure from what he did during the eight years when his Democratic successor, President Obama, was in office. Bush might have simply said that this is all now on the current president's plate and declined to weigh in. He didn't. There is no love lost between the Bush family and Trump. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush \u2014 and by extension, George W. Bush \u2014 were often ridiculed by Trump during the 2016 primaries. \"Low-energy Jeb\" was one of Trump's favorite putdowns. Last year in February, George W. Bush campaigned for his younger brother in South Carolina, the state that turned out to be candidate Jeb Bush's last stand. Perhaps this week's comments from the 43rd president stem from lingering bad feelings over 2016. Whatever the reason, they are consistent with his long-held belief. And they are a departure from his practice of not providing fodder that can be interpreted as casting judgment on a sitting president. In these interviews \u2014 even as he promotes his paintings and his book about wounded warriors \u2014 he seemed to jettison any such concern.",

All social classes have unspoken rules. From A-list celebrities to teachers, doctors, lawyers, and journalists \u2014 there are social norms that govern our decisions, whether we realize it or not. Researcher Elizabeth Currid-Halkett studies social networks, and has observed certain patterns across swaths of American culture. In her book Starstruck: The Business of Celebrity, she looks at the super elite: the celebrities who populate the Hollywood Hills and the tabloids in our grocery stores. She makes a distinction between fame and celebrity. \"Fame is simply people knowing who you are,\" she says. \"The sheer number of people who know who someone is, is very different from a public being fixated upon someone.\" For example, we all know who Bill Gates is \u2014 but we aren't all wondering what Bill Gates ate for breakfast today, the way we might wonder that about Beyonc\u00e9, or Barack Obama, or Jennifer Aniston. This week on Hidden Brain, we look at the invisible qualities that all celebrities have in common, and how our interest in them builds because of cues we get from one another. Later in the episode, we look at another elite group: the yoga-loving, Whole Foods-shopping, highly-educated group that Elizabeth Currid-Halkett calls The Aspirational Class.

Mark Meadows, R-N.C., talks about health care earlier this month and conservatives' opposition to the health care bill proposed by GOP leadership and the White House.\n                \n                    \n                    Mark Wilson/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Freedom Caucus chairman Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., talks about health care earlier this month and conservatives' opposition to the health care bill proposed by GOP leadership and the White House. Since the Republican health care bill died recently, President Trump has been looking to shift blame for the early failure in his administration. Last week, he found an easy scapegoat \u2014 the conservative House Freedom Caucus, that had voiced reservations about the Affordable Care Act replacement plan from the outset. In a series of tweets, the president raised the specter of even backing primary challengers against some of the caucus's members, and later began calling out the group's leaders by name. If @RepMarkMeadows, @Jim_Jordan and @Raul_Labrador would get on board we would have both great healthcare and massive tax cuts & reform. The Freedom Caucus will hurt the entire Republican agenda if they don't get on the team, & fast. We must fight them, & Dems, in 2018! But the not-so-veiled threats by the president are likely to have little impact in these conservative districts, where most members easily outperformed Trump and, instead, would have faced more viable primary threats from the right if they had backed the deeply unpopular Obamacare bill. \"The Freedom Caucus members all won big and they all have essentially very, very safe seats,\" said Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution's Governance Studies program, who has done research on congressional primaries. \"And they would have faced hell if they hadn't voted against this because their primary electorates are driving this, and they are very conservative.\" Throughout the recent debate over the GOP health care bill, many Freedom Caucus members stood up and said the bill was not what they or their constituents had in mind when they promised for seven years to repeal Obamacare. To them, it left too many of the problems with Affordable Care Act in place, including tax credits and subsidies and expanding Medicaid. There was a last-ditch effort from the White House to woo these conservative members to the president's side, promising to shift control over insurance requirements to cover \"essential health benefits\" to the states, but then that change caused some moderate House Republicans in danger in 2018 to threaten to abandon the bill. Ultimately, Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan lacked enough votes from both GOP moderates and conservatives to be sure the bill would pass if Ryan put it on the House floor. An analysis from Republican pollster Chris Wilson of WPA Research, who worked for Texas Sen. Ted Cruz's presidential campaign, found that support for the GOP bill, the American Health Care Act, was at very low levels in districts of Freedom Caucus members. \"House Freedom Caucus members held the line, and the data show that is precisely what their constituents wanted,\" Wilson wrote in an analysis. A Quinnipiac University poll showed that the bill only had 17 percent support nationally. Freedom Caucus members won their districts last November by bigger margins than Trump, too. An NPR analysis found that the roughly 30 members of the conservative caucus won reelection by an average of almost 37 points. Trump, however, carried their districts by about 26 points. But as Trump's tweets indicate, the key to knocking off any of these members would lie in a primary. But for these lawmakers, running to their right is almost impossible \u2014 and that's the only way to defeat them. According to NPR's analysis, they won their primaries by an average of 77 points last year, and about half of them didn't even have a primary challenger. In fact, the bigger threat for them was if they had supported the GOP bill. Conservative groups such as the Club for Growth and Heritage Action had planned to keynote the health care vote \u2014 meaning that if they'd supported the Trump-Ryan bill, their cumulative conservative score would have taken a hit on the groups' annual scorecard and given ammunition to a primary challenger. But, the groups promised they would have the backs of anyone who opposed the bill. Two Koch-backed groups, Americans For Prosperity and Freedom Partners, announced they planned to establish a seven-figure fund \"to stand by principled lawmakers who keep their promise of fully repealing Obamacare.\" So, there's good reason why Freedom Caucus members have seemed unconcerned by Trump's threats. \"If somebody can get to the right of me in the primary, God bless him,\" Arizona Rep. Trent Franks told Roll Call. Texas Rep. Louie Gohmert, a Trump ally, told the Dallas Morning News that if the president didn't stop with the friendly fire, they would stop coming to his defense too. \"If he weakens and hurts those who stood with him when our leadership was coming after him and abandoning him, we may not be around to help him during the future assaults,\" Gohmert said. Michigan Rep. Justin Amash likened Trump's threats to taunts from a schoolyard bully, telling reporters that, \"It's constructive in 5th grade. It may allow a child to get his way, but that's not how our government works.\" There are reports and speculation that Trump and Vice President Pence could visit some of these Freedom Caucus districts over the upcoming recess to try to get back at them for not supporting the GOP health care bill. Such a move would not just be unprecedented by a sitting commander in chief \u2014 it would be politically unwise. The reality is that defeating an incumbent is hard work \u2014 it not only takes recruiting viable candidates but helping them with fundraising and campaign infrastructure. Well-heeled outside groups have helped knock off lawmakers in the past, but that's usually been when they deem the lawmaker too liberal for a conservative district. Over the past two cycles, only five incumbents have lost their primaries; the numbers only typically spike in years after redistricting, like 2002 and 2012, when some lawmakers are grappling with radically different district lines or are forced into primaries with fellow incumbents because of reapportionment. On top of the political reality of primaries, Trump is also looking at a House of Representatives that is very much in play in 2018, and becomes more so every day as his approval ratings fall. Spending what little \u2014 if any \u2014 political capital he has to defeat safe GOP members would be a suicide mission that would only give Democrats more ammunition during the midterms and further drain an already depleted base. Ultimately, the political sin that Trump is claiming here of not signing onto his much-criticized bill is unlikely to be a negative with voters in these districts. Instead, it's only likely to help the House Freedom Caucus with voters \u2014 many of whom may only be more skeptical of Trump's conservative bona fides, even if they did vote for him, after his about-face on health care. \"I think it is, at this point, unproductive,\" Wilson, the GOP pollster, said of Trump backing primary challengers against Freedom Caucus members. \"He would be far better off inviting them to the White House and crafting a piece of legislation that has a better chance of passage.\" James Davis of Freedom Partners, one of the conservative groups that has pledged to help members who opposed the bill, also said he wanted to see more outreach from the White House over the issue to find a solution instead of striking out at members. \"We're going to stand by those folks, whether it's now or in the future,\" Davis said. \"We are working together to try to find a solution.\" The approach Trump has taken over the past week, by lashing out at the Freedom Caucus is, as NPR's Tamara Keith noted, straight out of his 1987 book, Trump: The Art of The Deal: \"Much as it pays to emphasize the positive, there are times when the only choice is confrontation. In most cases I'm very easy to get along with. I'm very good to people who are good to me. But when people treat me badly or unfairly or try to take advantage of me, my general attitude, all my life, has been to fight back very hard.\" But, if Trump continues down a futile road of turning Freedom Caucus members who should be his allies into enemies by backing uphill primary challenges to them, it's the next line in that paragraph that may be the most predictive and foreboding: \"The risk is that you'll make a bad situation worse, and I certainly don't recommend this approach for everyone.\" He goes on to say that \"things usually work out for the best in the end,\" and that may have been true for Trump in business, when he was used to negotiating bilateral deals. But in a multilateral attack where he's overmatched by lawmakers whose support runs much deeper and stronger than his, the outcome likely won't be as positive.",

President Trump's status with the Conservative Political Action Conference has gone from \"it's complicated\" to a full-on committed relationship. That turnaround was to be expected, given that the former reality TV star and billionaire businessman pulled off an unlikely upset last November that finally gave attendees at CPAC what they had been salivating over for more than a decade \u2014 control of the White House, Congress and a new conservative justice nominated to the Supreme Court. But to do that, attendees had to be willing to embrace Trump's brand of populist conservatism that hasn't always jibed with the more libertarian strain that's been in command at CPACs of yesteryear. \"Is Trump a conservative? He's not \u2014 no, I don't think so,\" said college student Matt Longenacker who was attending from Lancaster, Pa. Attendees were able to show their support of both the president and other conservative values at merchandise stands and even a pop-up photo booth.\n                \n                    \n                    Marian Carrasquero/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption But the 21-year-old still cast his ballot last November for Trump, albeit with some reservations that Trump might actually grow the federal government instead of shrinking it. \"Unfortunately, it takes somebody who isn't willing to play by the rules to get the job done. And right now, that's how I tend to agree with him in that sense,\" Longenacker said. Cheryl Posavac, 49, from Philadelphia, made the case that Trump did show some shades of conservatism that blended in with a more libertarian worldview. \"He's a true believer in America and the Constitution,\" she said. \"I don't think we've seen that in a while \u2014 somebody very much championing that. Not really; not in the traditional sense.\" 1 of 10 Is Trumpism the new Reaganism? The last person who embodied the group's perfect conservative ideal was one that Trump's team was quick to draw a comparisons to throughout the week \u2014 President Ronald Reagan. Vice President Mike Pence acknowledged in his speech Thursday night that his own political marriage with Trump may have seemed like an odd one, given their contrasting images. \"You know, I'm a small town guy. He's big city. I'm Midwest, he's Manhattan Island,\" the former Indiana governor laughed. \"He's known for his bigger-than-life personality, his charm, and his charisma. And I'm, like, not.\" But, it was another one-time famous star who ultimately provided the mantle to which all other conservatives are still measured up to. \"You know, from the outset, our president reminded me of somebody else, a man who inspired me to actually join the cause of conservatism nearly 40 years ago, President Ronald Reagan,\" Pence said. American Conservative Union Chairman Matt Schlapp, whose group sponsors CPAC each year, made the same comparison. \"You know the last time a president of the United States came to CPAC in his first year?\" he asked the crowd before introducing Trump Friday morning. \"Ronald Reagan in 1981.\" White House chief of staff Reince Priebus also made sure the allusion to the 40th president was clear. \"Some of the core principles of President Trump are very similar to those of Ronald Reagan,\" the former Republican National Committee chairman told CPAC attendees on Thursday. \"When you look at peace through strength and building up the military ... peace through strength, deregulation. You think about the economy, the economic boom that was created. And some of it is going to take a little time, I mean, to get the jobs back; to get more money in people's pockets. Those things are going to happen.\" A conversation with Reince Priebus, Steve Bannon and Matt Schlapp in the Potomac Ballroom on the second day of the conference.\n                \n                    \n                    Marian Carrasquero/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption While there are some similarities in Trump's view of America's great days that lie ahead, his speech to CPAC was not Reagan's \"shining city on a hill\" or brimming with the kind of optimism that the former president inspired. But the speech was not exactly the dark \"American carnage\" Trump talked about in his inaugural address just over a month ago, either. To hear the president tell it, his initial relationship with CPAC that began six years ago when he first addressed the gathering was love at first sight. \"I walked the stage on CPAC. I'll never forget it, really. I had very little notes and even less preparation,\" Trump reflected on Friday. \"So when you have practically no notes and no preparation and then you leave and everybody was thrilled, I said, 'I think I like this business.' \" He didn't run the next year after giving that speech in 2011, but the ultimately successful campaign he would launch in June 2015 drew from those same populist ideals he laid out to CPAC in his first appearance. He told the crowd six years ago that if he were president \"we'll be taking back hundreds of billions of dollars from other countries that are screwing us, we'll be creating vast numbers of productive jobs, and we'll rebuild our country so that we can be proud.\" (Left) Howard \"Cowboy\" Wooldridge, a retired detective who was promoting drug legalization.

But before that, she had been behind Texas Sen. Ted Cruz in the primary, leading one of the superPACs supporting him. A year ago, it was Cruz who looked like he was in the driver's seat at CPAC, winning the presidential straw poll and ribbing Trump for skipping out on the gathering. Cruz was back again at CPAC after embracing Trump late in the campaign. But many of the other usual mainstay speakers were absent, as The Washington Post pointed out. There were no speeches from one-time crowd favorites like Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul or Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. Not even GOP congressional leaders like Speaker of the House Paul Ryan or Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell made appearances.

Both Pence and Trump insisted that the health care law would be overhauled the replaced, though neither offered any specifics. While attendees and conservatives as a whole will want to eventually see results of those promises and ensure that Trump isn't just offering \"empty talk,\" the president and his advisers returned to his usual punching bag \u2014 the media \u2014 or \"fake news,\" as Trump and others have taken to calling mainstream news sources.

His chief strategist Steve Bannon \u2014 the former head of the controversial Breitbart News \u2014 was even more direct when he appeared on stage with Priebus on Thursday, using his favorite derisive label of the \"opposition party\" for the media. \"It's going to get worse every day for the media,\" Bannon said, going on to warn the crowd that \"if you think they are giving you your country back without a fight, you are sadly mistaken.\"",
