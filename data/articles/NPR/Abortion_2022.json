The landmark decision was one of the top political stories of 2022. There was a lot that happened in politics in 2022, from the consequential midterm elections to the U.S. Supreme Court's historic abortion ruling and record migration at the southern border. Meantime, the country is still trying to recover from the COVID pandemic, while girding for a potential recession, as this year also saw high gas prices and soaring inflation. Here are just some of the top political stories of 2022, in no particular rank or order: It's going to be divided federal government come the new year. As expected, Republicans won control of the House, but the GOP will only have a narrow, four-seat majority, and Democrats held the Senate. The results were in large measure because of the intensity of opposition to the Supreme Court's conservative-majority decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, and the many election-denying, Trump-backed candidates who were rejected in key swing seats and competitive Senate races. The conservative majority on the Supreme Court made its mark in 2022, stunning the country by overturning the right to an abortion in the U.S. But that was just the headliner. It also weighed in on gun rights, environmental regulations, immigration and more, and appears ready to take aim at race-based affirmative action with a decision coming by June. President Biden appointed Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court, making her the first Black woman to sit on the high court. But her appointment did not change its ideological balance, which now tips decidedly in conservatives' favor. There are fears of a recession on the horizon, as inflation in 2022 hit decades-long highs. Gas prices and food costs soared, and with Democrats in control of Congress and the White House, it put them on their heels in this year's midterms. The Federal Reserve raised interest rates multiple times throughout 2022, squeezing borrowing in hopes of stemming inflation. That all had the effect of burdening Biden's approval ratings, which remained in the low-40s for much of the year.

It has caused political headaches for Biden and his administration, and led to political stunts like Texas' and Florida's governors sending migrants to Democratic-controlled cities and enclaves. All the while, there has been no movement on a comprehensive federal immigration overhaul in almost a decade in a country that has millions of immigrants living in the U.S. after crossing the border illegally and massive backlogs in immigration courts due to understaffing and underfunding. Despite a 50-50 Senate and the legislative filibuster still in place, Democrats \u2014 and sometimes, some Republicans \u2014 were able to get quite a bit done in 2022, from the Inflation Reduction Act, which tries to address climate change and the cost of prescription drugs; to the CHIPS Act, which aims to boost domestic manufacturing of semiconductor chips; to taking a step toward protecting same-sex and interracial marriages with the Respect for Marriage Act; to reforming the Electoral Count Act and funding Ukraine's defense against Russia's invasion. Russia's move tested Biden's ability to maintain NATO unity and get funding from not just the U.S. Congress but the governments of those other countries. Ukraine has held off Russia in a deadly war that has lasted since February. More funding will be needed and was a major reason why Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy made his first trip outside the country since the war began, cloaked in secrecy, to the United States and addressed Congress this month.

Trump announced \u2014 exceedingly early \u2014 that he is running for president again, just a week after Republicans underperformed in the midterm elections, with many pointing the finger at Trump for why. Many of his endorsed candidates lost in purple states, highlighting his political weaknesses. He also remains under the cloud of multiple investigations: his Florida home, Mar-a-Lago, was searched due to the removal of classified documents from the White House; the Trump Organization was found guilty of decades of criminal tax fraud; a special counsel is overseeing a federal investigation into the former president; and several years of his taxes were turned over to Congress and partially released Friday. The tightly scripted hearings featured never-before-seen video and explosive testimony from people who participated in the deadly riot, local elections officials and people who worked in the Trump administration or on his campaign hoping to get him reelected. They painted a picture of a then-president who inspired a mob of his supporters to storm the Capitol and did nothing to tamp down the violence for hours despite watching it all unfold and being urged to do so. But many Trump supporters never watched. Instead, it was mostly Democrats and, according to polling, a slim majority of independents who paid closest attention \u2014 and blamed Trump more for what happened afterward. Now, with Republicans set to take control of the House, the select committee will be disbanded and the two GOP members on the panel won't be returning to Congress. Extreme weather events and billion-dollar disasters continue to be more common than they were decades ago. This year saw the catastrophic damage wrought by Hurricane Ian. There was record drought in the West and low levels in the Mississippi River, along with extreme rainfall and flooding in other parts of the U.S. It's all taking a toll on communities. And it means local and federal leaders are scrambling in the short term to come up with disaster recovery funding and unable to, in a consistent and united way, prepare for the long term. Crosses seen on Nov. 8 are set up to honor those who lost their lives during the Robb Elementary School shooting in Uvalde, Texas.\n                \n                    \n                    Mark Felix/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption This year again saw many more mass shootings. In two instances just days apart, 10 Black people were killed in a supermarket shooting in Buffalo, N.Y., and 21 were killed, including 19 children, in a school shooting in Uvalde, Texas. The incidents led to modest gun reforms signed into law. It was the most significant gun legislation signed in decades, but that only shows how difficult it is to get sweeping changes passed federally, like raising the age of who can purchase certain firearms or whether the country could ever return to an assault-style weapons ban. Other mentions: Some other big events included Nancy Pelosi stepping down as House Democratic leader after two decades, making room for Hakeem Jeffries of New York and a new generation of party leaders. The year also saw political violence with Pelosi's husband, Paul, attacked in their California home and Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh targeted, which led to stepped up security for the justices.",

Gretchen Whitmer shows a \"My Body My Decision\" shirt at the 14th District Democratic headquarters in Detroit on Nov. 8. Ahead of the midterms, pollsters and strategists and \u2014 yes, journalists \u2014 were obsessed with voters' top issues. In poll after poll, including polling at NPR, voters reported inflation to be the most important issue. Despite this, a lot of people do not vote with a single issue top-of-mind, and that makes it hard to know how much abortion swayed the midterms. This year's midterms were certainly unusual \u2014 when the president's approval is below 50% (as President Biden's is), their party loses 43 House seats in midterm elections, on average. This year, Democratic losses may be in the single digits. As a result, less than six months after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, both sides are working to figure out how big a part abortion played in the midterms. First things first \u2014 the usefulness of polls in saying exactly how much people factored abortion into their voting is extremely limited. It's true that polls regularly showed Democrats caring more about the topic this year than Republicans, which makes sense in the wake of the Dobbs decision overturning Roe. It's also true there were voters who said the topic of abortion got them out to vote. The effect was probably much more complicated though, says Sarah Longwell, founder of the Republican Accountability Project, which opposes Republicans who deny the 2020 election results. She explained a pattern she often saw in swing voter focus groups she ran. \"You say, 'OK, what issues are on your mind?' They say, 'inflation, the economy, crime, supply chain.' That's what they'd say up top,\" Longwell said. But then, abortion would come up later: \"When you get to the vote choice, like, 'Who do you want to vote for, [Arizona Democratic Senate candidate] Mark Kelly or [Republican] Blake Masters?' People would say, 'Oh, I'm not voting for Blake Masters. His position on abortion is insane.' And that theme would repeat itself with Adam Laxalt in Nevada, with Doug Mastriano in Pennsylvania, with Tudor Dixon in Michigan, where I think abortion played a huge role.\" One way to read this is that abortion was not necessarily top of mind, but it was a prominent data point supporting a narrative that some Republicans were too extreme. That's how Democratic strategist Tom Bonier sees it. \"My general theory on this is that Dobbs really focused and crystallized these other issues that weren't really resonating,\" he said. \"When you think of sort of just the general narrative on democracy and the sanctity of our electoral process, Democrats were talking about a lot, but it wasn't really making a dent in the numbers. And then Dobbs happens. And I think it made this argument of Republican extremism more real to voters. It connected the dots.\" Exit polls have been notoriously messy in recent years, so it will be months until we have reliable data (like Pew Research's regular validated voter studies) on how people voted. However, voter registration data does seem to show that the Roe overturn immediately motivated women. \"Almost everywhere, what you saw was a pretty significant surge in gender gap in the two to four weeks after Dobbs,\" Bonier said. \"And then we saw an increase, but not as pronounced after that.\" That leaves a few questions unanswered, however. One is which women were motivated. Exit polls broadly suggest that young women broke hard for Democrats. But then, a post-election survey from AARP also showed that women over 65 swung significantly toward Democrats between July and November. In addition, there's the question of how much the issue motivated men \u2013 or didn't. Many polls show that women and men don't differ much on their abortion opinions. Data from this election could provide new nuances to that data, showing whether the issue motivates women to vote more than men, or whether it just took longer to motivate men. A second takeaway: Pro-choice policies, in isolation, did well. Five statewide ballot measures all came out in favor of abortion rights, even in red states like Kentucky and Montana. That's on top of an August win for abortion rights supporters on a Kansas ballot measure. And yet in some of those places, antiabortion rights candidates also prevailed. As Democratic strategist Rachel Bitecofer puts it: \"There are millions of people who voted yes for a referendum to codify Roe or whatever and then went and voted for pro-life conservative Republican candidates.\" Furthermore, plenty of politicians who famously favored restricting abortion easily won \u2014 Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, for example, and Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis. Why is that? Bitecofer thinks it's about ineffective communication by abortion rights supporters. \"You want to make sure people understand this man is the guy who's signing into law the bill to steal your rights,\" she said. She added, however, that the problem so far has been breaking voters' connections to party identity. \"People like heuristics. They like something that can tell them what to do without any mental investment. And that's why the party label is so incredibly powerful,\" Bitecofer said. Marjorie Dannenfelser is president of SBA Pro Life America, which opposes abortion rights. Conversely, she thinks that more spending on the ballot measures would have been key to helping abortion rights supporters prevail. In addition, she sees wins by people like Abbott and DeSantis as proof of their political power. \"The one thing you have in an election on the pro-life side and we've always had is the candidate \u2014 a human representation of the argument on the debate stage,\" she said. \"The reason that governors are winning well who have been ambitious for life is they've been articulating their position. They have the bully pulpit of the governorships.\" Longwell, from the Republican Accountability Project, says that for many voters, it's also simply about the salience of abortion. \"In Texas, people generally like the job that Abbott's doing, right? They thought that he did a good job on COVID, and culturally they feel like they are with him more than they're not with him,\" she said. \"And so people will tolerate being out of step [with him] on something like abortion, especially if it's not a high priority issue for them.\" One more takeaway \u2014 one that's harder to quantify \u2014 is what messaging strategy worked and how to move forward on the issue. For Dannenfelser, it's clear that Republicans failed, and that Democrats found a winning strategy. \"They ended up with a position that we need to label Republicans as for abortion bans generally, and do not go into the specifics of what a Republican is for or a pro-life candidate is for,\" she said. Multiple Democratic strategists agree that staying away from gestational limits was smart, though they often do not see it as painting Republicans as overly extreme, like Republicans do. \"I think it was not only smart, but right of them to say there isn't some line,  there isn't some like countdown clock in which you go from being a full autonomous human being to property of the state,\"  said Analilia Mejia, codirector of the progressive Center for Popular Democracy. Going forward, that leaves open the question of what the parties see as their best paths. To Republican pollster Whit Ayres, his party needs to abandon the tightest abortion measures. \"We have a number of laws that have been passed by Republican legislatures that are far from the mainstream, that include no exceptions, for example, for for rape or incest,\" he told a post-election panel at the Roper Center for Public Opinion. \"That's the very definition of outside the mainstream.\" The question is what Republicans do with that information \u2014 what they see as a winnable mainstream position? In the midterms, many Republican candidates avoided the topic of abortion. To Dannenfelser, that was a mistake. \"One thing you cannot do is expect to be a successful primary Republican candidate who says, 'It's a states issue and I don't expect to ever promote or sign a federal 15-week or heartbeat protection,\" she said. Rebecca Katz, senior adviser for John Fetterman's Senate campaign, likewise thinks her party needs to not just message but act \u2014 in this case, to pass abortion rights legislation. \"I don't think that folks should just be high fiving because we won a cycle with such a devastating impact,\" she said. \"There is a lot of work to be done.\"",

            "article_content": "Statewide votes on abortion played a huge role in the midterm elections. Measures defending abortion rights won in red states, blue states and independent ones.  ELISSA NADWORNY, HOST: Statewide votes on abortion played a major role in the midterm elections. Where the issue was on the ballot, voters largely signaled support for abortion rights. NPR national correspondent Sarah McCammon covers abortion policy, and she joins us now. Hi, Sarah. SARAH MCCAMMON, BYLINE: Hi, Elissa. NADWORNY: So we know that voters ranked abortion among the top issues of concern in these midterms. MCCAMMON: Right. NADWORNY: But let's talk about the places where the question was directly on the ballot. Where were these ballot initiatives, and how did they do? MCCAMMON: Well, it was a big night for supporters of abortion rights. You know, in three states, voters approved proposals to shore up abortion rights in their state constitutions. A couple of those - Vermont and California - were no big surprise. Michigan, though, was a big win for abortion rights supporters. Voters there approved an amendment that was put forward through a signature process to guarantee what was described as reproductive autonomy. And Democrats also kept the governor's mansion, took over the statehouse in a year when abortion rights were front and center in the campaign there. So on top of those, Elissa, there was Kentucky, a deeply red state, of course, but where abortion rights supporters still succeeded in quashing an amendment that would have been unfavorable to abortion rights. Anthony Romero is the executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union. His group got involved in several of these races. ANTHONY ROMERO: If you can win in a place like Kentucky, if you can win in a place - like we did in Kansas, I mean, the Republican voters are not with the Republican leadership. MCCAMMON: So he's referring there to a similar vote in Kansas in August. And he says, in this post-Roe v. Wade world, where a dozen or so states have banned abortion, he believes voters are pushing back and signaling that they don't support that level of restriction. And that includes many Republicans, he says. NADWORNY: What about the opponents of abortion rights? What are they saying about these results? MCCAMMON: So they acknowledged that some of these results are disappointing, but they're not willing to concede that they've lost the electorate on this issue. Anti-abortion groups have been focusing on the fact that they were outspent in many of these races by both Democratic candidates and groups like NARAL and Planned Parenthood, who invested heavily in messaging around abortion. I talked to Stephen Billy today. He's the vice president of state affairs for SBA Pro-Life America. STEPHEN BILLY: I think we'd better learn our lesson from the ballot initiatives that were - you know, we didn't win last night. As we go forward, I mean, it's clear that the abortion industry wants to use the courts to try to take the issue out of voters' hands. It's clear that they would try to use ballot initiatives where they're able to use outside money and to try to, you know, use ballot initiatives as a way to thwart the legislative process. MCCAMMON: So the argument he's trying to make there is essentially that these ballot initiatives don't really reflect the will of the people, which is kind of a tough case to make. Polling has consistently shown a majority of Americans support abortion rights, even if they do favor some restrictions. And it is true, though, that some - that supporters of abortion rights out-fundraised and outspent their opponents in some of these states. But there also was heavy investment by anti-abortion groups and lots of door-knocking by both sides. SBA, for example, just announced that they'll spend about a million dollars in the Georgia Senate runoff to support Republican Herschel Walker. And Billy, with SBA Pro-Life America, also stressed some of the successes for Republicans, especially governors like Brian Kemp in Georgia and Ron DeSantis in Florida, who've all opposed abortion rights and won reelection by solid margins. NADWORNY: You've been talking to people all year about their thoughts and feelings on abortion. Why do you think these anti-abortion laws are getting so much pushback now? MCCAMMON: Well, this was the first major election after the Dobbs decision overturning Roe v. Wade. And I think what's happened is that we are seeing the impact of that decision - seeing the impact of abortion bans - you know, access shutting down in many states and a lot of confusion in many cases. So it's no longer hypothetical. We've also heard from voters who have some nuanced views on abortion, but ultimately say they feel some of these restrictions have gone too far. And I think we saw that reflected in the polling and also in some of these votes last night. NADWORNY: NPR's Sarah McCammon, thank you. MCCAMMON: Thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.

            "article_content": "Heading into the midterm elections, abortion rights and the economy were very important issues to voters.  RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: Another swing state with a crucial race for control of the Senate is Wisconsin. Inflation and abortion also drove voters to the polls there. Republican Senator Ron Johnson is trying to hold on to his seat and push back a competitive challenge from Democrat Mandela Barnes. NPR political correspondent Danielle Kurtzleben is in Milwaukee and joins us now. Hey, Danielle. DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN, BYLINE: Hey, Rachel. MARTIN: So I want to hear about last night and the scene there. But first, can you just give us the stats as they stand in that Senate race? What do we know? KURTZLEBEN: Right. So as far as we know right now, with more than 90% of the votes in, Ron Johnson is slightly ahead of Mandela Barnes - ahead of him by a bit more than a percentage point. So that race has not yet been called. And last I saw from the Barnes campaign, they said they are waiting for every vote to be counted. So they have not conceded yet. And we're just going to be waiting to - until something more official happens. MARTIN: All right. So both candidates spoke last night, I imagine. Where were you listening to results and the candidates? KURTZLEBEN: Yes. Well, actually, I was in downtown Madison, and there was another major statewide race, and that is the governor's race here. I was at a party in downtown Madison for Governor Tony Evers. He is a Democrat. And it was a very measured celebration, a very muted celebration for a while as everybody waited for results because Wisconsin is such a purple state. It is always close. And everybody was just sort of waiting to see, OK, is he ahead? Yes, he is. OK, how much, and is this for real? But Evers eventually gave his victory speech as 1 a.m. approached. And here's one thing he said in his speech. He said he thinks he did well because he keeps his promises and that he works hard. And he rounded that out by adding this. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TONY EVERS: That's who I am, folks, and that's what I've always been. Some people call it boring, but you know what, Wisconsin? As it turns out, boring wins. (CHEERING) KURTZLEBEN: And Tony Evers - he's a mild-mannered guy. He talks a lot about how he's a former schoolteacher and school administrator. But it's - I don't think it's a stretch to also read this as a rejection of Trumpist politics, that, you know, Tony Evers is not brash or loud or harsh. So, yes, everybody was very excited, but it still wasn't full-on, super excited by the end of the night because there was an understanding that, yes, they weren't ahead in that Senate race, and they were still awaiting it. MARTIN: Yeah. You talked to a lot of voters. What did they tell you about the two big issues - right? - inflation and abortion? How did that weigh on their choices? KURTZLEBEN: Oh, very heavily, and, of course, it's respective by party, right? I mean, inflation was super, super important to Republican voters and abortion super, super important to Democratic voters. And in both cases, if you talk to voters, they'd say, well, yes, and that issue, inflation/abortion, makes this one of the most important elections of my lifetime. But what's interesting to me is also sort of the limits of those issues. For example, Democrats - Democratic voters, of course, feel inflation, and they said, yes, I'm concerned about it. But several voters I talked to said, look, I don't know if who we elect is going to change inflation all that much. It seems to be a global problem. Similarly, you had a lot of Republicans who said, yes, I am pro-life, but there are bigger issues. And also, one other thing to add is that as Election Day approached, I - you really got the sense here and elsewhere that the reaction to the Dobbs decision was sort of baked in already - that is, that the people who were energized, who were going to be energized by the Dobbs decision already - by, say, August or September, already were energized by it - right? - and that there weren't a lot more people who were going to be won over. So the parties went after those voters in other ways. MARTIN: NPR's Daniel Kurtzleben reporting from Wisconsin, thanks, Danielle. KURTZLEBEN: Yes, thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.

Follow live updates and election results here. LOS ANGELES \u2014 California will amend the state constitution to guarantee the right to abortion and contraception. Voters approved the ballot measure known as Proposition 1, according to a call by The Associated Press. Loading... Proposition 1 was a direct response to the U.S. Supreme Court's Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization ruling. State Democratic leaders introduced the proposition language after a draft of the Dobbs decision leaked last spring. Following the high court's final decision in June, the Democratically controlled state Senate approved putting it on the ballot. The language voters endorsed will add to the California Constitution that \"the state shall not deny or interfere with an individual's reproductive freedom in their most intimate decisions, which includes their fundamental right to choose to have an abortion and their fundamental right to choose or refuse contraceptives.\" Current state law allows abortions before the fetus is viable, generally around 24 weeks into a pregnancy. Abortions can also be performed after viability, but only if a doctor determines a pregnant person's life or health is in danger. The new constitutional amendment doesn't contain the word 'viability,' and legal scholars don't agree about whether the viability standard that is in place will remain. Some say the language is too broad, potentially opening the amendment up to being struck down by courts in the future. Courts may have to sort out the details later, but passage of the constitutional amendment cements California as an abortion sanctuary.More Election 2022 Coverage",

The amendment broadly protects \"personal reproductive autonomy unless justified by a compelling State interest.\" Loading... The amendment adds another layer of protection in Vermont that abortion rights advocates say is necessary in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. The right to an abortion is already protected in Vermont under a 2019 state law. The amendment was largely expected to pass in the left-leaning state. Two consecutive state legislatures approved the proposed amendment before it was added to the ballot. Republican Gov. Phil Scott has also signaled his support for the amendment. Still, in the leadup to Election Day, anti-abortion groups spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on canvassing services and ad campaigns to convince Vermonters to vote no. Some critics of the new constitutional amendment said its language is overly broad. Others were concerned that it could allow for late-term abortions.More election 2022 coverage",

Kathy Hochul has won a full four-year term, continuing her rapid ascent in New York politics from a little-known lieutenant governor just over a year ago. The Associated Press made the race call. Loading... Hochul was thrust into campaigning soon after taking office, and polls showed the race against Long Island Republican Congressman Lee Zeldin tightening late. Zeldin, with former President Trump's backing, focused his campaign on crime and inflation. But he could not overcome Democrats' sizable registration edge. Republicans have not won a statewide election since 2002. Hochul is the first woman elected governor of New York. She replaced Andrew Cuomo, who resigned under pressure in August 2021 over multiple sexual harassment claims. Hochul's victory is also unusual for an upstate politician. The former Buffalo-area Congresswoman made frequent appearances in New York City and on Zeldin's home turf of Long Island, hoping to boost Democratic turnout. Hochul won a three-way primary in June. She and fellow Democrats faced criticism over the state's bail reform laws, her prodigious fundraising in a state capitol long defined by corruption, and new gun laws passed in a July special session after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the state's century-old limit on the concealed carrying of weapons. Her first lieutenant governor resigned after being arrested on federal bribery charges. During the campaign, Hochul drew a sharp contrast with Zeldin, promising steady leadership for the next four years compared to a conservative candidate who voted to overturn the 2020 presidential election results. Hochul largely focused her campaign on protecting abortion rights in the state. More Election 2022 coverage:",

Abortion ranks among voters' top issues for the 2022 midterms. The question for Democrats \u2014 who are in a historically unfavorable position as the party in charge of the White House and facing growing concerns about inflation and the rest of the economy \u2014 is to what degree the energy unleashed by this summer's U.S. Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade can be harnessed at the polls, and to what extent that energy can overcome voters' economic worries. Republicans, meanwhile, are primarily focusing on voters' concerns about the economy, inflation, and crime. In some cases, they're attempting to distance themselves from some of the most severe abortion restrictions that have taken effect since this summer's Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization decision. Here's a look at where abortion is, in one form or another, on the ballot. Supporters of abortion rights saw a major and largely unforeseen victory in Kansas in August when voters in the red state resoundingly rejected a ballot initiative that would have added language stating that the state constitution contains no protections for abortion rights. But that was just about six weeks after the Dobbs decision was released. The issue is on the ballot in several more states for this midterm election, including an anti-abortion measure in Montana, and measures in California and Vermont that would explicitly protect abortion rights in those states' constitutions.

Gretchen Whitmer. Whitmer faces faces Republican Tudor Dixon in Tuesday's election for governor. The overturning of Roe sent the question of abortion back to the states \u2013 making state legislators and governors extremely important in determining the laws and policies that regulate the procedure. Governor's races with mixed party control will be key, particularly in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin and Kansas \u2013 where Democratic governors have fought efforts to impose restrictive abortion laws. Advocates on both sides of the abortion debate would like to see national legislation on the issue. Abortion rights supporters have been pushing for passage of the Women's Health Protection Act, designed to codify Roe's protections in federal law. That legislation passed the House last year in a largely symbolic vote but has lacked the votes to overcome the Senate filibuster. Anti-abortion groups are supporting legislation proposed by South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham to ban the procedure nationwide at 15 weeks. Marilyn Musgrave, vice president of government affairs at SBA Pro-Life America, said without a nationwide abortion ban, people will continue to travel from states with restrictions to those with more liberal abortion laws. For example, \"California would be an abortion destination \u2013 it would be like abortion tourism,\" Musgrave said. Musgrave said her group is working to flip the House and Senate into Republican hands. President Biden has promised he would veto any such anti-abortion legislation that might pass while he's in office, but NARAL Pro-Choice America President Mini Timmaraju said that would be too close for comfort. \"We certainly don't want to let it get that far. That's a bad precedent,\" Timmaraju said. \"We're absolutely not going to let it get to that point; that's our goal.\" Butler, of Emily's List, said she is hopeful abortion rights will be top of mind for voters in what many political observers are suggesting may be a difficult midterm for Democrats. \"Voters are whole people; they carry their whole selves into the ballot box,\" Butler said. \"And what we have experienced as a nation is that our economy ebbs and flows \u2013 but once our fundamental freedoms are taken away, we don't know if we're ever going to be able to get that back.\" To that end, a coalition of national abortion rights groups is spending $150 million toward this campaign season, along with hundreds of millions more in abortion-focused ads from Democratic candidates themselves. Meanwhile, SBA Pro-Life America's Musgrave says the group's Women Speak Out Pac has contacted some 8 million voters nationwide on behalf of anti-abortion rights candidates and related ballot measures.",

            "article_content": "A look at how two key issues this election season \u2014 inflation and the fight over abortion \u2014 are informing voters' midterm votes.  RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: Throughout this election season, we have been talking with voters about how they're going to make their choices. As voting wraps up tomorrow, We want to look back at two major issues that shaped this campaign - the higher costs of gas, food and rent and the fight over abortion after the Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade. Joining me now, national correspondent Sarah McCammon, who covers abortion policy, and White House correspondent Asma Khalid, who's been reporting on the effects of inflation. Good morning to you both. ASMA KHALID, BYLINE: Good morning. SARAH MCCAMMON, BYLINE: Good morning. MARTIN: Let's start with the economy, Asma. So how has inflation affected the way people are thinking about their choices in these midterms? KHALID: Well, our own polling here at NPR, in fact, leading up to these final days of the election has shown that inflation is the top issue for voters. You know, I've spent more than a year tracking this issue. And early on, it was clear to me that rising prices were a concern to all sorts of voters - Democrats, Republicans and independents. But who people blame for inflation - I will say that often splits across party lines. You know, Democrats say inflation is a worldwide issue, a result of the pandemic and the war in Ukraine. Republicans say that Democrats mishandled the economy and have spent too much money. It is important, though, to say that I've heard this from people at early voting sites that although the economy is the top issue, as we see in polling, it is not the only issue people are considering. MARTIN: OK. So, Sarah, are they considering the issue of abortion? MCCAMMON: Definitely in some groups of people more than others - female voters, for example. So for Democrats, this issue of abortion gave them an early lift. We saw women registering to vote in large numbers after the Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health decision this summer overturning Roe v Wade. We saw voters in Kansas reject a ballot initiative in August that was seen as unfriendly to abortion rights. So Democrats and reproductive rights groups see this as a big opportunity and a critical moment for their issue. They've spent hundreds of millions of dollars on ads highlighting the post-Roe reality of abortion bans in more than a dozen states and more pending in court. People are traveling, being denied emergency care in some cases. And Democrats are warning about the prospect of more of this in states around the country. They point out that polls suggest a majority of Americans support abortion rights, albeit with some limitations, and did not want Roe overturned. So they think if they can get voters to turn out, it will be good for Democrats. KHALID: And if I can just add here, you know, the impact of the Dobbs decision also varies from state to state. In Michigan, for example, there's actually a ballot initiative to enshrine reproductive rights in the state's constitution. And Democratic analysts told me that that has been a hugely energizing factor for Democratic voters. But broadly, in this past month, polls show that Republicans are more enthusiastic to vote. And that has affected the closing arguments from Democratic leaders. They've become kind of scattershot. You know, I was out traveling with President Biden this last week. And he mentioned abortion, but it was not his primary focus. He's been touting Democratic policies, specific bills that Democrats have passed and arguing that Republicans will make inflation worse if they take over Congress, that they would threaten programs like Medicare and Social Security. MARTIN: OK. But, Sarah, I want to get back to something that you said just a moment ago. A majority of Americans actually support abortion rights. So as a result of that, how are Republicans framing this issue? MCCAMMON: Well, some Republican candidates have been de-emphasizing the issue to some degree. For example, Arizona Senate candidate Blake Masters toned down some of the language about abortion on his website. And he's emphasized his opposition to abortion later in pregnancy, which is more in line with public opinion. Most Americans support legal abortion in the first trimester. Most oppose it by the third, although the vast majority of abortions happen in the first trimester already, and later abortions very often are for medical reasons. But Republicans are pointing to that fact and the fact that most Americans support some limitations. They're trying to paint Democrats as extremists on the issue. That said, Rachel, Republicans are somewhat on the defensive on this point. You know, they've gotten Roe overturned. People are seeing the impact of abortion bans, including stories like rape victims or people with medical emergencies being turned away in some cases. MARTIN: Asma, what are - what do you hear from Republican voters in conversations you've had as they - as these people weigh both these issues, abortion and inflation? KHALID: You know, I've been really interested to hear how both Republicans and independents are wrestling with these issues. And I asked a bunch of voters about this in Georgia, where the Senate race is incredibly competitive. One man I interviewed - his name is Dale Jordan (ph), voted for Republicans up and down the ballot, except in the Senate race. He told me he did not think the Republican candidate there was qualified, but he didn't like the Democrat candidate either. And so he voted for a third-party person. DALE JORDAN: On abortion, I try to stay out of that debate for various reasons. But at the same time, it's the economy. I mean, you know, when I'm paying - going for a family of four going to the grocery store and it's almost $400 for groceries at times, that's not acceptable. KHALID: You know, I spoke with other voters who said despite having some very real concerns about restrictions on abortion, that was not enough to convince them to vote for Democrats. And some were willing to cross party lines for the Senate race, bu not the governor's race, which, you know, I think is noteworthy because the GOP incumbent governor there in Georgia has already signed off on restrictions to abortion. So, you know, Rachel, in some ways, my takeaway here is that voters' motivations are multifaceted. MARTIN: Yeah. Sarah, what races in particular are you watching, I mean, especially when you think about where the abortion debate is most focused? MCCAMMON: So along with that ballot question that Asma mentioned in Michigan, I'm watching Kentucky, where abortion rights groups are trying to replicate what happened in Kansas in August when voters rejected a similar measure. Amendment 2 on the Kentucky ballot would spell out that the state constitution there includes no protections for abortion rights. Reproductive rights groups are trying to appeal to independent and persuadable voters there. I was in Louisville a few weeks ago, which is where I met Mike Seavert (ph). Now, he says he's a registered Republican. He thinks abortion is usually wrong and too often used as what he calls birth control. But he wants to make sure that the law does leave some room for things like medical emergencies. So I listened in as a door knocker from Planned Parenthood was talking with Seavert. MIKE SEAVERT: I will put no because I believe... UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Yes. SEAVERT: ...If it's saving someone's life, absolutely... UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Yes, sir. SEAVERT: ...As a law enforcement for several years, a firefighter for several years. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Yes, sir. SEAVERT: But it's used inappropriately. MCCAMMON: So Seavert is the kind of persuadable voter that both sides have really been targeting in a lot of these tight races, Rachel. Then I'm also watching states where the outcome of governor's races could determine access - places like Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Kansas, which all have Democratic governors currently and Republican legislatures. Also, North Carolina - there's no governor's race there. But Democrats fear that Republicans could gain a supermajority in the Statehouse, which would enable them to override their Democratic governor. And then don't forget about state Supreme Court justices, as well as attorneys general and local prosecutors who all have a lot of authority in this area, as well. MARTIN: NPR's Sarah McCammon and NPR's Asma Khalid, thank you to you both. KHALID: Thank you. MCCAMMON: Thanks. (SOUNDBITE OF REDI HASA'S \"DAJTI MOUNTAIN\") Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.

LOUISVILLE, Ky. \u2014 Abortion has been unavailable for months in Kentucky, and will likely remain so \u2013 unless activists can defeat an anti-abortion measure on the Nov. 8 ballot. \"It's very rigid and unforgiving as a constitutional amendment,\" Beth Kuhn, a volunteer for the Protect Kentucky Access campaign, told a voter who answered her knock on his front door on a recent sunny afternoon in Louisville. Kuhn explained that Amendment 2 would add explicit language to Kentucky's constitution, stating that it offers no protections for abortion rights. Activists appeal to state courts If approved, Amendment 2 would complicate \u2014 if not entirely thwart \u2013 ongoing efforts to overturn two state abortion bans that are currently in effect. Those laws offer no exceptions for rape or incest and only narrow exceptions for medical emergencies.  They took effect this summer, after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned decades of abortion-rights precedent, including Roe v. Wade. That left reproductive rights advocates with little recourse beyond Kentucky's state constitution, which they argue contains privacy protections that should safeguard at least some abortion access. Abortion opponents say they're putting up thousands of yard signs across Kentucky in support of the measure, which would amend the state constitution to say it contains no abortion rights protections.\n                \n                    \n                    Sarah McCammon/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Abortion opponents say they're putting up thousands of yard signs across Kentucky in support of the measure, which would amend the state constitution to say it contains no abortion rights protections. Looking to Kansas Now, voters are being asked to weigh in on a measure that would amend the Kentucky constitution to explicitly state that it contains no protections for abortion rights. And reproductive rights activists are drawing inspiration from Kansas, another red state where voters rejected a similar effort in August. \"In order to restore access to legal abortion in Kentucky, we have to defeat Amendment 2,\" says, Rachel Sweet, campaign manager for Protect Kentucky Access, the effort to scuttle the amendment. \"And then the plaintiffs in those case cases need to win.\" In August, Sweet led the successful effort to defeat the anti-abortion amendment in Kansas, where abortion remains legal up to 20 weeks. That vote \u2014 in another conservative-leaning state \u2014 surprised many observers. Sweet says here in Kentucky, the stakes are even higher. \"In Kansas, we were trying to really make an argument about protecting the status quo and protecting the rights that we had in the Kansas Constitution,\" Sweet says. \"This is really about how do we start reversing the tide of these really extreme abortion restrictions that we've seen?' A chance to make abortion bans permanent For Kentuckians who oppose abortion, Amendment 2 offers an opportunity to shore up state restrictions for the long term. Addia Wuchner, executive director of Kentucky Right to Life, is a leader of the \"Vote Yes\" campaign. She points to decades of federal litigation around abortion under the Roe v. Wade precedent that legalized abortion nationwide from 1973 until this year, saying she wants to make sure that Kentucky doesn't see drawn out battles over abortion bans in its state court now. \"We've been in 49 years of Roe,\" Wuchner says. \"No one wants 49 years of the Kentucky Constitution drug out into this battle.\" Public polling on the ballot initiative is hard to come by. But a 2019 survey from the firm Public Policy Polling found that a majority Kentuckians support abortion rights and oppose criminalizing the procedure. Wuchner argues the amendment before voters would keep the state constitution neutral on abortion \u2014 which her organization opposes in virtually all circumstances. \"Let's talk about what [opponents of the amendment] are afraid of,\" Wuchner says. \"Afraid that they won't have the right for women to take the lives of their children. Do you think that's a right?\" Wuchner notes that here in Kentucky \u2014 as in Kansas \u2014 abortion rights supporters have significantly out-fundraised groups who oppose abortion. But the amendment also has strong support from powerful conservative religious groups, including the Catholic Conference of Kentucky and the Kentucky Baptist Convention. On a recent fall Sunday, abortion rights activists gathered to knock on doors in Louisville on behalf of the Protect Kentucky Access campaign.\n                \n                    \n                    Sarah McCammon/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption On a recent fall Sunday, abortion rights activists gathered to knock on doors in Louisville on behalf of the Protect Kentucky Access campaign. Echoes of an earlier time Standing on her front lawn across town, Altia Connor says her faith points her to a different conclusion when it comes to abortion. \"[People] have to answer to God for themselves. But it's still their right ... to their body,\" she says. Connor is standing in the sunshine as a local activist delivers a yard sign that says, \"VOTE NO \u2014 Amendment 2.\" Now 71, Connor was a teenager in the 1960s \u2014 before Roe v. Wade. She remembers girls sometimes taking desperate measures when they got pregnant \u2014 particularly one girl from her church, who died after a botched abortion. \"I'm thinking now, as a grownup, that young girl didn't have to die,\" she says. \"She didn't have to try these homemade remedies ... if she'd had another choice.\" A message to state leaders Once again, Kentuckians do not have that choice. Saundra Curry Ardrey,  a political scientist at Western Kentucky University, said voters have an opportunity to send a message to state leaders \u2013 especially Supreme Court justices \u2013 about where they stand on the issue. She notes that Kentucky's Supreme Court is waiting to rule on the future of the state's abortion bans until after the election. \"I think they are waiting to see what the will of the people will be,\" Ardrey said. \"And I would suspect, too, that a lot of the candidates, and a lot of the legislators in the state, are also looking to see how pro-choice Kentucky has become, or what the will of the people will be.\"",

But in a shift from the past, recent polling shows abortion and reproductive rights  \u2014 issues emphasized by Democrats \u2014 have risen dramatically in importance for those voters ahead of this year's midterm elections. Nationwide, Pew found abortion was a very important issue for 57% of Latino voters in August \u2014 up 15 percentage points since March. More than one in four Latino voters surveyed this month by the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials Educational Fund listed reproductive rights as their top issue \u2013 up from around 4% in 2020, according to Dorian Caal, the group's director of civic engagement research.

The congressional district in Virginia that Del Castillo calls home is the center of a bellwether race on abortion rights. The contest in Virginia's newly drawn 7th Congressional District could determine whether the issue of reproductive rights could be enough to overcome what Latino voters overwhelmingly report is their overriding concern: the economy. The race pits a Latina Republican law enforcement officer, Yesli Vega, against a Spanish-speaking former CIA officer, Rep. Abigail Spanberger, D-Va. The Democrat is defending her seat, albeit in a new district that does not overlap much with her current one, in the outskirts of Richmond, Va. The Cook Political Report recently moved its rating of the race from Lean Democratic to Toss-Up. The new district, on the outer edge of the Washington, D.C., suburbs and the surrounding countryside, is less white and more diverse: roughly one in five voters identify as Latino.

In an interview after the rally, Marcia Fuentes, one voter in this district, said Vega's message struck a chord. Like Vega, Fuentes' father is a pastor and the two attended the same church as children. She said her faith guides all her decisions, including on abortion. \"Once you put a child in your womb, that's it,\" she said. \"He needs to come to life, because nobody has the right to kill a child.\" Fuentes says she'd like to see Congress ban the procedure. Vega seemed to agree during the Republican primary, saying that she found liberal states' abortion laws quote \"unacceptable.\" When speaking to reporters after the event in October, Vega distanced herself from national abortion bans. \"They've reverted that back to the states,\" she said. \"So it's a state issue.

Like other GOP candidates, Vega has shied away from talking about abortion after the June Supreme Court decision, especially after Axios published a recording of her seeming to downplay the risk of someone getting pregnant after a rape. Her team did not respond to repeated requests for an interview. In an interview, Spanberger said the comments were part of a broader trend of \"extreme\" rhetoric from Vega, who has questioned the validity of the 2020 election, defended people who stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021 and referred to the FBI as the \"deep state.\" \"For a woman who may choose abortion \u2014 that is up to her and her medical professional,\" Spanberger said. Spanberger said she believes that to also be true for pregnancies beyond 20 weeks \u2014 \"catastrophic situations where a woman will die, or a fetus is not viable.\" She said Congress should act to codify Roe v.

Still, Elena Lane said the overturning of Roe was one of the driving motivators to giving up her Saturday morning to knock doors for Spanberger in Prince William County. The Virginia realtor called the court's recent decision \"terrible.\" \"I wanted to cry, because they took [away] the right [from] a woman,\" she said. It's not lost on Lane that abortion is now legal in parts of her native Mexico but no longer universally legal in her adopted home country. But it's not just abortion on Lane's mind. She said democracy itself is on the ballot, and that, more than anything else, keeps her firmly in the camp of Democrats.",

Harris has held more than 20 events focused on reproductive rights, hearing from activists, state legislators, health care providers, legal experts, faith leaders, civil rights leaders, and others about their concerns \u2014 and making clear that she sees it as a key issue ahead of November midterm elections. \"Let's link arms, and do what we need to do, including in the next 34 days,\" Harris said last week at one such event at Central Connecticut State University in New Britain, Conn. With roughly a month until Election Day, polls show that abortion is a top issue motivating both Democratic and independent voters. A September NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll showed that 77% of Democrats said the Supreme Court's decision on abortion makes them more likely to vote this year. In her New Britain stop, Harris was introduced by Rep. Jahana Hayes.

In this file photo from August, she meets with college presidents. Harris has brought people from across the country to listening sessions at the White House, but she has also traveled to states like North Carolina, Indiana and Florida, and will be traveling to more states with competitive elections into November. These events give Harris the chance to hear from people affected by the new restrictions on abortion. But they're also a \"smart move\" politically, said Democratic strategist Adrienne Elrod. Even when they don't make national news, the events get a lot of local headlines. \"Her visit to those states will likely lead most of the daily papers in that state, or at least in that area,\" Elrod said in an interview. \"It makes a lot of sense because this is an issue that will drive turnout and drive a lot of the decisions coming out in the midterm cycle,\" she said. People who have been in the meetings say Harris is focused on the details. \"I think what is immediately evident when you attend those meetings is that she is very much involved in the conversation,\" Jocelyn Frye, an ally of the Biden administration who is president of the advocacy group National Partnership for Women and Families. \"This not a meeting where she is just reading talking points. She is immersed in what's going on day-to-day ... it was a conversation where she really wanted to learn. She had done her homework,\" Frye told NPR.

In the intersection, Harris said there's potential to build coalitions. \"Bring everybody together,\" she said in Connecticut Angela Romero, a state representative from Utah, said that message resonated with her when she attended one of Harris' roundtables in August with other Latina state lawmakers. She said she left the meeting feeling like the call to action Harris had given them was about more than abortion. \"She also gave us a challenge as elected officials to organize,\" Romero said. \"It was about marriage equality, it was about ensuring that everyone has the opportunity to vote.\" Romero said her takeaway from the roundtable was a reminder that there is a lot at stake \u2014 and she says it's pushed her to engage with her constituency, to knock on doors and encourage people to vote.

PHILADELPHIA \u2014 During the final stretch of the primary race to be Pennsylvania's next governor, Democratic candidate Josh Shapiro made a strategic choice. His campaign put $840,000 into television ads about GOP candidate and conservative election-denier Doug Mastriano. \"If Mastriano wins, it's a win for what Donald Trump stands for. Is that what we want in Pennsylvania?\" intoned the ad's voiceover. The ad, while not overtly positive, got Mastriano's name on the airwaves in a crowded nine-person race that he ended up winning. It's been a Democratic tactic this year: boosting candidates with more right-wing views in the hopes that they would be easier to beat this November. How that is paying off during the general election depends on where you look. Democratic campaigns or affiliated groups bought nearly $44 million in ads for Republican candidates in five states during primaries, mostly in governors' races, according to the campaign finance watchdog group Open Secrets. In Arizona, they highlighted one GOP candidate's previous donations to Democrats, NBC News reported. Her opponent, supported by former President Trump, won. In the blue states of Illinois and Maryland, those races are rated as solidly Democrat and not considered competitive, according to The Cook Political Report. But in purple states, races for positions that will wield significant power over policies from election integrity to abortion rights are much closer. In the swing state of Pennsylvania, Mastriano didn't just win, he beat eight other Republicans by a wide margin, more than 20 points than his closest challenger. Shapiro ran unopposed. His press secretary says the ad buy was not a strategy to boost Mastriano, just getting a jump on messaging for the general election. But some say it was risky. \"You always have to be careful of what you wish for,\" says Charlie Gerow, a longtime GOP political consultant and one of the candidates Mastriano beat during the primary. On the road to the Nov. 8 general election, there are some signs this gambit is paying off for Democrats in Pennsylvania. As of the most recent campaign finance reports, filed June 16, Shapiro had more than $13 million on hand, compared to Mastriano's less than $400,000. Campaign finance reports due Sept. 27 will indicate whether Mastriano has managed to narrow  the gap. The Democrat is using this funding to run a more traditional campaign. Deep pockets have allowed him to place a slew of attack ads, targeting everything from Mastriano's ties to the right-wing social media site Gab to his 2001 master's thesis. In that paper, he argues that only the military, based on Judeo-Christian values, can save the United States from civilian leadership bent on political correctness. In a state where both the House and Senate are firmly in GOP hands, Shapiro also campaigns as the last line of defense for abortion rights in Pennsylvania, promising to \"veto that bill\" if he is elected governor. Abortion is legal in Pennsylvania up to 24 weeks into a pregnancy, with some restrictions. Mastriano, the GOP candidate, keeps focus on his base. His campaign has placed no TV ads and he sometimes kicks traditional media out of campaign events, where he sticks to talking points that center on hot-button issues for right-wing voters, criticizing issues ranging from COVID-19 vaccine mandates to transgender athletes.

If elected governor, he would be in a position to appoint Pennsylvania's chief election official, the secretary of state. On Jan. 6, 2021, Mastriano went to the Capitol but says he didn't go inside. Images from that day appear to show him moving past police barricades, farther than he previously admitted to going. His campaign did not return calls and emails asking for an interview. Mastriano also has not moderated his stance on abortion. As a state senator, he sponsored a bill to ban the practice after about six weeks, with no exceptions. \"They want to say that Republicans don't believe in women's rights, that's a bunch of baloney. We believe as conservatives in a woman's right to be born,\" said his wife, Rebbie, at the same campaign event. Recent polling also shows Shapiro out in front \u2013 by as little as 3 points, although the polling average is larger. In Arizona, where an email blast from the state Democratic Party called attention to donations GOP candidate Karrin Taylor Robson made to Democrats in the past, Trump-backed Kari Lake won and now trails Democratic candidate Katie Hobbs by an average of 3 points, according to the survey site Five Thirty Eight. Neil Oxman, a longtime Democratic political consultant in Pennsylvania, says candidates often try to meddle in opponents' races \u2013 it's just that this time the world noticed. \"I don't think you're going to know whether it works until election night,\" he says, although he thinks Shapiro's campaign has been \"an A.\" But in areas where the race is close, turnout could be decisive. Factors from abortion rights to the economy could push voters to the polls. \"I think we will see that Mastriano voters are marking their calendars for November 8th, because they are chomping at the bit to get out and vote,\" says Gerow.",

A judge temporarily blocked Ohio's ban on virtually all abortions on Wednesday, again pausing a law that took effect after federal abortion protections were overturned by the Supreme Court in June. COLUMBUS, Ohio \u2014 A judge temporarily blocked Ohio's ban on virtually all abortions Wednesday, again pausing a law that took effect after federal abortion protections were overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court in June. The decision means abortions through 20 weeks' gestation can continue for now, in keeping with state law in place before the ban. Hamilton County Judge Christian Jenkins' decision to grant a 14-day restraining order against the law came as part of a lawsuit brought by the ACLU of Ohio on behalf of abortion providers in the state. The clinics argue the law violates protections in the state Constitution guaranteeing individual liberty and equal protection. The suit also says the law is unconstitutionally vague. The law was signed by Republican Gov. Mike DeWine in April 2019, and prohibits most abortions after the first detectable \"fetal heartbeat.\" Cardiac activity can be detected as early as six weeks into pregnancy, before many people know they're pregnant. The law had been blocked through a legal challenge, then went into effect after the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision was overturned. DeWine's opponent in the November election, Democrat and abortion rights proponent Nan Whaley, called Wednesday's ruling \"a victory, albeit a temporary one, for Ohio women.\" She said, \"Ohio women won't be safe until we have a pro-choice governor who doesn't seek to impose extreme views like government mandates against private health care decisions.\" Abortion providers and their defenders have said the law has already created a host of hardships, including forcing a 10-year-old Ohio rape victim to travel to Indiana for an abortion. The judge's decision is a blow for abortion opponents, who have been celebrating implementation of the long-delayed restrictions since Roe was overturned. Right to Life of Greater Cincinnati had anticipated the judge was leaning toward a pause after a hearing held last week, when he asked questions about the 10-year-old's case and suggested, \"We should just be very honest about what we're talking about here.\" \"Let's just be very honest,\" the anti-abortion group wrote in a statement, \"it is always, always best when LIFE is chosen. Always.\"",

Democrats have picked up some momentum this election cycle with wins in multiple special elections, following the Supreme Court's overturning of Roe v. Wade. And the FBI search of former President Trump's Florida home has thrust Trump back into the spotlight, front and center. Lots of his candidates have won contentious primaries; he's consolidated his base; and his renewed presence has threatened to make the November elections a choice rather than a referendum on President Biden. Biden and the White House leaned into that Thursday night with an unusual prime-time address that broke no news or made any big announcements. Instead, Biden took the opportunity to elevate Trump and make it a choice between what Biden and Democrats stand for and MAGA Republican extremism, as he sees it, and their rising influence in positions of power throughout the country. \"I believe America is at an inflection point,\" the president said in front of Independence Hall in Philadelphia, the same city where he launched his 2020 presidential campaign, \"one of those moments that determine the shape of everything that's to come after. And now America must choose to move forward or to move backwards.\" On the eve of Labor Day weekend, the traditional pivot to the final sprint of general elections across the country, here are three takeaways from Biden's speech: Elections, especially midterm elections, are traditionally a check on the president. Inflation is high, Biden is unpopular and people are pessimistic about the direction of the country. That usually would mean a wipeout in a president's first midterm. So this gave Biden an opportunity to deflect from that \u2014 and lay out a choice. \"MAGA forces are determined to take this country backwards,\" Biden said, \"backwards to an America where there is no right to choose, no right to privacy, no right to contraception, no right to marry who you love.\" He highlighted threats to democracy as being urgent and instigated by Trump. Biden doesn't often use Trump's name, but he name-checked him three times in this speech. And when you do that, it's going to look and sound political. And that was obviously intentional. With Trump back in the news, it offered Biden a way to elevate him, hold him up as the standard-bearer of the GOP, what it stands for, and draw a line in the sand. \"It's pretty clear they want to amplify the MAGA message,\" said Democratic strategist Joel Payne. \"Almost feels like a pre-argument against what a Republican House might be pushing for the next two years, setting up a broader narrative about how he is fighting to stop Republicans from anti-democratic moves.\" You'd be forgiven if you confused Biden's address for a convention speech, because that's where you draw contrasts with your opponent and lay out a vision for the country. But that's not to say there aren't real or urgent threats. Election deniers are closer to controlling elections in key places, and as we've said many times watching the Jan. 6 hearings, the institutions of democracy may have held in 2020, but only because of the people who were running them. Now many of those structures are run by people who support Trump and his election lies all the way. We've seen political violence, the FBI is facing threats, as are poll workers and local election officials. There is no doubt that conspiratorial elements of Trumpism are more potentially operational now than they were before the 2020 presidential election. \"Democracy cannot survive when one side believes there are only two outcomes to an election \u2014 either they win or they were cheated,\" Biden said. And with the election two months away, the White House would argue highlighting that threat is key. Democrats' recent momentum in multiple special elections has largely been due to abortion rights, not necessarily about threats to democracy. Yes, a recent NBC poll showed threats to democracy rising to the No. 1 issue, and that is significant, as it overtook cost of living, which was second. But it was only with 21% of respondents. Economic-related items when combined \u2014 cost of living and jobs and the economy \u2014 were 30%, higher than threats to democracy. What's more, when you break down those who said threats to democracy were their top issue, 53% were Democrats, while 32% of Republicans and 11% of independents did. And Democrats and Republicans certainly view the \"threats to democracy\" very differently. Democrats obviously see Trump and \"MAGA extremism\" as the threat, while many Republicans, who have believed Trump's election lies, believe Democrats and (not) rigged elections are the problems. So the White House might be overreading polls here. Republicans, many of whom are now aligned with Trump, are incensed. House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy gave a speech before Biden spoke and said the president needed to apologize for what he saw as insulting the millions of Americans who voted for Trump. It certainly shows the 180-degree shift McCarthy has made since after Jan. 6 in his quest to become House speaker. But it also highlights the high bar Biden has in trying to make clear he is talking about Republican elected officials and not voters. \"Not even a majority of Republicans are MAGA Republicans,\" Biden said. \"Not every Republican embraces their extreme ideology. I know because I've been able to work with these mainstream Republicans. But there's no question that the Republican Party today is dominated, driven, intimidated by Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans. And that is a threat to this country.\" That is a very fine line for a president, who isn't always artful with his words, to walk and stick to. The GOP will obviously use this to fire up their base against Democrats and Biden in these midterms, but the White House is gambling that conservatives who dislike him are already fired up \u2014 and Democrats need to keep their base engaged. \"There is a risk of overreaching on this,\" Payne said, \"especially at a point when Republicans are on their heels trying to protect some anticipated gains in the '22 midterms.\" But, he added, \"I think it also helps juice the base [with] moral clarity on saving the democracy.\"",

            "article_content": "A number of Republican candidates are amending their positions on abortion ahead of this fall's midterm elections.  AILSA CHANG, HOST: Abortion rights supporters have gotten some encouraging signs since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. Voter registration data and recent election results suggest that women and young voters are especially fired up. And as a result, NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben reports that some Republicans are changing how they talk about abortion. DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN, BYLINE: About a week ago, Arizona Republican Senate candidate Blake Masters tweeted an ad featuring him playing with his kids. (SOUNDBITE OF POLITICAL AD, \"BLAKE MASTERS FOR US SENATE\") BLAKE MASTERS: Look, I support a ban on very late-term and partial birth abortion. And most Americans agree with that. That would just put us on par with other civilized nations. KURTZLEBEN: That's a different tone than Masters took on abortion in March, when he spoke to Catholic news outlet EWTN. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MASTERS: Every society has had child sacrifice or has had human sacrifice in some form, and this is our form. And it needs to stop. KURTZLEBEN: This discrepancy was highlighted when NBC News reported that his website had also changed. It no longer, for example, characterizes Masters as 100% pro-life. That shift is part of a broader trend of GOP candidates changing how they and their websites talk about abortion since the Supreme Court's decision in the Dobbs case. In March, Minnesota Republican gubernatorial candidate Scott Jensen told Minnesota Public Radio his position. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) SCOTT JENSEN: I would try to ban abortion. I think that we're basically in a situation where we should be governed by pro-life. There is no reason for us to be having abortions going on. KURTZLEBEN: But in an August interview with NPR, he said he supports exceptions for rape and incest. And he added this. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) JENSEN: If a pregnant woman's mental or physical health is endangered, then this is no longer any kind of a situation for the legal system. KURTZLEBEN: Tresa Undem is a pollster who has worked heavily on abortion. And to her, these changes make sense, as a majority of Americans oppose total or near-total bans on the procedure. TRESA UNDEM: Post-Dobbs, where I see sort of the biggest shifts is the potential in turnout for independent women and Democratic voters and young voters who are all looking to be more mobilized by this issue. KURTZLEBEN: Marjorie Dannenfelser is president of SBA Pro-Life America, which opposes abortion rights. She says changes in rhetoric from candidates like Masters don't mean their actual views have changed. MARJORIE DANNENFELSER: I do not see this as a change of position at all. I've talked to him extensively back and forth on this before and now. The position that he stated before is the one shared by the whole pro-life movement, and that is, of course, to end abortion. KURTZLEBEN: To her, the path is to tighten laws over time. DANNENFELSER: We have partial victories along the way. And we're very clear about where we want to end up. Blake Masters is a great example. He is very clear about what his personal position is, but he's also clear about what's achievable. KURTZLEBEN: Abortion rights supporters and opponents agree that candidates' statements, not views, are changing. Where these groups differ is on why. CHRISTINA REYNOLDS: It's not that complicated what they're trying to do, and it's not that clever. It's just, they don't want voters to understand what the end goal is KURTZLEBEN: Christina Reynolds is vice president of communications at Emily's List, which supports Democratic pro-abortion-rights women candidates. REYNOLDS: What we see is that voters don't like the Supreme Court decision. They think the Republicans have gone way too far, and they believe that this is a right and a freedom that they should have. KURTZLEBEN: Republican candidates have in some cases removed abortion from their websites all together. Colorado congressional candidate Barbara Kirkmeyer has in recent months done so, along with removing a number of other topics. Her position on abortion is clear. In a July interview with a Colorado Fox affiliate, she said she opposes it, except to save a pregnant person's life. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BARBARA KIRKMEYER: I have said for years that I'm 100% pro-life, and I remain that way. But again, the issues that are facing this district that my opponent is so out of touch with has to do with the inflation. KURTZLEBEN: And that's one more tactic many Republicans may take on abortion as the midterms approach - try to talk about something else. Danielle Kurtzleben, NPR News. Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.

            "article_content": "This week promises to bring developments in the efforts to overturn the 2020 election, abortion, guns and more.  AYESHA RASCOE, HOST: It's going to be a week full of developments on the moment's biggest stories - the ongoing investigation and litigation over the attempts to overturn the 2020 election, more states restricting abortion, guns and more. So it's a great time to turn to NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson. Glad to have you with us, Mara. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Happy to be here. RASCOE: So South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham doesn't want to, but he is nevertheless scheduled to testify Tuesday in Fulton County, Ga.'s criminal case over the last presidential election. Do you think he'll follow through? LIASSON: That's a very good question. You know, a federal judge has ruled that Graham must appear before the Fulton County, Ga., grand jury that's investigating these Republican efforts by Trump and by Graham to pressure Secretary of State - Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to overturn the 2020 election results in Georgia. Graham has asked the 11th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals to put his subpoena on hold while he appeals, so we don't know what that court will rule. Graham's argument is that he shouldn't have to testify before the grand jury because his phone calls to Raffensperger were part of his official role as the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee and that that is protected by the speech and debate clause of the Constitution. RASCOE: On Capitol Hill, the congressional investigation into the other attempt to overturn the 2020 election, the storming of the Capitol on January 6, is still in progress, and former Vice President Mike Pence made some comments about it. Is he going to testify? LIASSON: That is another good question. Pence said he would consider testifying before the committee if he were to receive an invitation. He hasn't gotten one yet, but Pence's top aides have already testified to the committee. This is not unprecedented that a president or a vice president, former or current, would testify before Congress. Remember, Pence refused Donald Trump's request to decertify the election, and for that he got death threats. The insurrectionist rioters on January 6 chanted hang Mike Pence. They erected a gallows outside the Capitol. But Mike Pence is also running for president in the Republican Party. So he has political considerations, too. So we're waiting to see if the committee will issue him an invitation and what he will say in response. RASCOE: Is he officially running for president or we think he is (laughter)? LIASSON: Not officially. He's doing all the things a person would do who's thinking about running for president. LIASSON: You were making some news there. I just wanted to make sure. But, you know, turning to another issue that could likely have an effect on the midterms, trigger laws are taking effect in some states this week to restrict abortion. It's kind of like a slow rollout of the Supreme Court's June decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. What's going on there? LIASSON: That's right. These trigger laws have been on the books for some time in a lot of states. Basically, they said if and when Roe is overturned, which now it has been, the state - say Michigan - would either revert to a 19th century law that bans all abortions or maybe a new law would go into effect. And, you know, the big majority of Americans are pro-choice with restrictions. Over 60% of Americans think abortion should be legal up to a certain number of weeks, or it should include exceptions for rape, incest and health of the mother. This was Roe. Roe was the middle ground on abortion. So now the big political battle is about which party will be seen by voters as extreme on abortion because most voters are moderate on abortion. Republicans want to paint Democrats as the party of abortion on demand. That's hard to do if the Democrat says they support Roe because Roe has restrictions. Democrats want to paint Republicans as supporting laws that would criminalize abortion, prosecute women for using abortion pills, supporting laws to ban abortion in all cases. And so that's why these trigger laws are intensifying what is already a pretty pitched political battle. RASCOE: In the minute we have left, you have a Parkland survivor and now a gun restriction advocate, David Hogg, trying to drum up support for a march in support of Uvalde parents in Austin on Saturday. Is gun control still top of mind for people three - now, three months after Uvalde? LIASSON: For some voters, yes. Democrats certainly hope it is. This is another culture war issue like abortion, which for a change might actually favor Democrats. You know, in the past, the gun issue motivated Republicans more than Democrats. But after Uvalde, after Buffalo, after these increasing number of mass shootings, you have 80 - 90% of Americans say they favor universal background checks. They favor raising the age to buy a gun from 18 to 21. Big majorities even favor a ban on assault weapons. These are popular positions. They are the Democratic positions. And Democrats are hoping they will motivate some voters to come out. RASCOE: Quick question for you - your colleague, NPR's own Ron Elving, said he thinks that the Democrats will lose a lot of seats in the House, but they will hold steady in the Senate. Do you feel that way? LIASSON: Well, Republicans are worried that they have nominated a whole bunch of candidates for Senate that are going to be too extreme. And you see this everywhere - in Pennsylvania, in Georgia, in - even in red state Ohio. The list is pretty long. And Republicans are worried that because their candidate quality isn't good enough, even though they have the big trends in their favor, they might be just about to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory, even though they only need one net seat pickup to take back control of the Senate. RASCOE: That's NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson. Mara, thank you. LIASSON: You're welcome. Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Fred's Lounge is in the town of Mamou, situated among the rice fields and crawfish ponds of what's called the Cajun prairie. So successful are Saturdays at Fred's that the tavern is closed the rest of the week. The live radio feed was the idea of a local educator named Revon Reed back in the 1960s. Now his son, Seth Reed, a metalworker, is a Saturday morning regular. \"We dance, we drink, we have a good time,\" Seth says. \"This is the only bar that's still old-school. Nothing has changed since it was built. That's what I love about it. They still have the same urinal from back in the '40s in the bathroom.\" The Acadians, or Cajuns, who populate this region descended from Roman Catholic French Canadians who were expelled from the Nova Scotia region by the British in the mid-1700s. They made their way to the bayou country of South Louisiana and here they thrived, preserving their culture and folkways. But a number of factors worked against the language. Cajuns were punished for speaking French in school, Cajun GIs left the region to fight in the world wars and learned English, the discovery of oil ushered in more English, and television further diluted the language. Radio is part of a broad movement to save Cajun French from extinction. Eight radio stations in Southern Louisiana still broadcast partially in French. KVPI, located in Ville Platte (Flat Town), does news, weather, commercials, talk, a swap shop, and even obits in French \u2014 more than any other station. This year, the Louisiana Association of Broadcasters gave KVPI a Uniquely Louisiana award.

La Tasse to regulars. The weekday morning program begins: \"Bonjour, mes amis. Comment se va ce matin? Nois aimerions avoir de vos nouvelles, alors appelez-nous.\" (Hello friends, how are you this morning? We would love to hear from you so give us a call.) Yet here in deeply conservative Trump country, the callers don't talk about abortion or election fraud or the perfidious Democrats. They're discussing where to find the sweetest watermelons, what food to bring to the cemetery on All Souls Day, how to kill maggots under the house, how they miss the fins on cars of the 1950s, and when is the best squirrel hunting. One host bid adieu to a voluble caller, \"And a happy squirrel weekend to you!\" In an era of venomous talk radio, La Tasse de Caf\u00e9 is downright wholesome.

There is a bit of difference. We have our own lingo and dialect down here, and we're proud of it.\" Most of the elderly French-speaking callers want to reminisce about life on the Cajun prairie back in the day. On a Monday morning in late June, a gentleman called in to remember a particularly competitive race for sheriff. Both candidates spoke French as their first language. \"The one candidate was telling the other in French, 'As for you, you couldn't track a black elephant in the snow!'\" says Jackie Duplechin Miller, the 81-year-old co-host of La Tasse on that morning.

And I'm afraid it's going to be tough to keep it going.\" The Cajun patois in Louisiana continues its steep decline.

Everyone who knows anything about politics knows something about Kansas and Arizona \u2014 or thinks they do. But things we all know for sure can turn out to be wrong. It's at least worth taking a second look at Kansas and Arizona, which we all knew were among the most conservative places in the country, steeped in the voting proclivities of the West and its agriculture-and-extraction economies. Their political histories are deeply entwined with national Republican politics. Prior to 2020 these states had each voted Democratic for president only once in 70 years. They have also produced between them four of the Republican nominees for president, including three since 1964, a remarkable record given their populations. But this past week showed surprises can happen where you least expect them. In Kansas, a special referendum to override the state constitution and empower the legislature to enact new abortion restrictions was rejected. Big time. The no option got 58% of the vote. Turnout was nearly double what it had been for the last comparable primary and nearly equal to the November 2018 midterm election. Unaffiliated voters who had nothing else to vote on in the primary came out to vote on the abortion measure \u2013 and turn thumbs down. In a strong signal with national implications, the anti-abortion vote lagged the vote for former President Trump in the state by 15 points. That data point begs the question of how other Trump states or \"red states\" might respond to the Supreme Court's latest abortion ruling when it comes to elections this fall. The New York Times' Nate Cohn produced a formula of polls and voting data to estimate how all 50 states would vote if faced with a similar ballot measure. He found only seven states where the anti-abortion measure would pass and estimated the popular vote nationally would be 65% against such a measure. Abortion opponents were shocked this week, having assumed that Kansas would be a great place to start the state-by-state struggle over abortion rights that the Supreme Court has set in motion. It seems that they, too, had too many presumptions about Kansas. In Arizona, primary voters dumped a full slate of conservative statewide candidates backed by the Republican establishment in favor of four election deniers who reject the results of the state's 2020 presidential vote. From the nominees for governor and senator down to Arizona secretary of state and attorney general, the candidates who paid obeisance to Trump on this issue won his endorsement and were nominated. Arizona Republicans who still revere the late Sen. John McCain, a frequent Trump nemesis, were appalled. So were those who honor the memory of the legendary Sen. Barry Goldwater, whose libertarian vision of conservatism recruited Ronald Reagan, among others, to the GOP. Republican Maricopa County Supervisor Bill Gates called the results \"a catastrophe for the Arizona Republican Party and I would argue [for] our democracy.\" The GOP is well known for swallowing its bitterness after primary fights and coalescing around its nominees for the general election. But the difficulty of doing that this year was underscored by the chair of the state party committee, Kelli Ward, who called the primary \"an exorcism of John McCain.\" It's hard to imagine a sharper delineation of what divides Republicans in Arizona. The same might be said in other states where Republican candidates have bound themselves to Trump's baseless and caustic claims about the 2020 election so as to win his backing. It is possible, indeed quite plausible based on polling, that the Republican slate will be defeated, leaving Arizona Democrats holding all the statewide positions and more seats in Congress than ever before. That would surely be another case of presumptions exploded. So the first lesson from these uncommon events is the unreliable nature of our notions about our neighbors. It turns out the real world of politics state-by-state is more complicated than we thought. Go figure. Kansas, people are suddenly noticing, currently has a Democratic governor named Laura Kelly. It turns out the previous 10 governors of Kansas, going back 50 years, have included five Democrats. The state's most populous county, suburban Johnson (literally across the street from Kansas City) cast 68% of its vote to protect abortion this past week. It is represented in Congress by Sharice Davids, a Democrat and a Native American woman. Arizona, long known for its ranches and retirement communities, has become increasingly non-Anglo in its population mix. Its Hispanic population was 19% in 1990, 25% in 2000 and is 32% now. In addition, the influx of new arrivals from other states, especially California, has swollen the population and transformed the politics of Maricopa County, which includes Phoenix and its suburbs. Maricopa now votes Democratic, and that alone has scrambled the math in statewide elections. A second nugget to set aside from the vote this week is the potency of a human trait often seen in American politics, especially in the West and in the sparsely populated parts of the country. People bristle and resist when told what they can or cannot do. We knew this about guns, vaccinations and masks. We are seeing some of that with regard to abortion rights, even in red states. Yet a third thing to bear in mind always is that generalizing or projecting from one election outcome \u2014 or even a long history of them \u2014 is hazardous. Every race is always local, and every candidate is a potential game changer. That is how, for example, Alabama could elect a Democrat named Doug Jones to the Senate in a 2018 special election and dismiss him two years later in a presidential election cycle. The Democrat was the same, his opponents and the electoral circumstances were vastly different. So it is too soon to draw too many conclusions about what this past week's votes might mean for November in other states. In the general election in Kansas and Arizona, as elsewhere, the outcomes will reflect the national issues and trends. But that input will be filtered through the special circumstances of the state and then refashioned by the personalities of the candidates involved. While it is clear the abortion issue drives turnout and motivates women (70% of the new registrations after the Supreme Court's abortion decision this spring in Kansas were women), it is not clear how that will translate beyond the handful of states that are holding referenda similar to the one in Kansas. And while we can see the polls that suggest the Trump-backed Republicans are weaker in the general election match-ups against Democrats, it is too soon to see which party will be more motivated in three months. An incendiary individual can motivate more voters in support or in opposition. And in Arizona, for example, the Senate nominee Blake Masters has been quoted saying President Biden's COVID adviser Anthony Fauci \"will see the inside of a jail cell this decade.\" There was another in 1974, the year Richard Nixon resigned the presidency on the brink of impeachment in the Watergate scandal. In Arizona that year, the incumbent Republican senator whose name was on the ballot was Barry Goldwater. In Kansas, it was Bob Dole. Besides the hangover from Watergate, the salient issues in that fall campaign were gas prices, inflation and abortion. The latter had leaped into prominence with the Supreme Court decision the previous year in Roe v Wade.  Opposition to that decision had come immediately from the U.S. Council of Bishops and a few other powerful religious organizations, but it was just beginning to grow into its eventual power.

Barry Goldwater, on Sept. 17, 1996. One place where that power was felt early was Kansas. Dole was seeking his second term in the Senate and carrying a great deal of Nixon baggage, having been one of that president's chief defenders as a senator and as chairman of the Republican National Committee. Polls showed him trailing his Democratic challenger, a doctor named William Roy, as Election Day neared. Then an anti-abortion group produced a flyer depicting aborted fetuses. The flyers appeared on the windshields of cars parked near churches on Sunday morning. Dole edged Roy by 1.7%, the closest election of his 35-year career. He would become Senate majority leader in 1985 and the GOP presidential nominee in 1996. Dole died late last year. Goldwater did not have a close call in the 1974 election, one of the few Republican incumbents who did not. He was insulated from the Watergate fallout, having been a Nixon critic. He was also credited with persuading the president to resign when it was clear he would be impeached and convicted. Goldwater, it surprises some to learn, was a supporter of abortion rights. He stuck to that view to the end, serving in the Senate until 1986. He did not change his view, despite the rising influence of social conservatives in the Arizona state party, and was a champion for the separation of church and state until his death in 1998. In the Roe v Wade year of 1974, Goldwater was still a household name nationwide. He had sought and won the Republican nomination for president 10 years earlier, vanquishing the Eastern Establishment of the GOP. While he was crushed that fall by incumbent Democrat Lyndon B. Johnson, Goldwater did carry five states in the Deep South, showing the path ahead that five other Republican nominees would later follow to the White House. Along the way he inspired a generation of youthful politicos, including a teenaged Hillary Rodham in suburban Chicago. A \"Goldwater Girl\" in 1964, she would later become Hillary Clinton, serve as first lady, senator from New York, secretary of state and 2016 nominee for president. One wonders if she still has her \"AuH20in64\" button among her keepsakes.",

On Tuesday night as results rolled in for Kansas's consequential vote on abortion rights, advocates on both sides of the abortion debate were watching closely, looking for lessons as they prepare for similar votes on abortion rights measures this fall. The results in Kansas \u2014 the nation's first statewide vote on abortion rights after Roe v. Wade was overturned in June \u2014 has upended traditional wisdom about the politics of abortion. In a Republican-leaning state that preferred President Donald Trump by 15 points in 2020, the outcome was a landslide that few expected: Nearly 60% of voters chose to support abortion rights. Among the states with ballot measures scheduled for November is Kentucky, where voters will consider a constitutional amendment similar to the one that failed in Kansas. Supporters of abortion rights there have been \"energized\" by Tuesday's results, said Samuel Crankshaw of the ACLU of Kentucky, which opposes the proposed amendment. \"We're in a lucky position where we can learn from allies in other states at this point,\" he said. Addia Wuchner, executive director of the Kentucky Right to Life Association, watched the election results at home in her office, she said. She called the result \"heartbreaking.\" With fewer than 100 days to go until the election, her coalition is whirring up its messaging, fundraising and training efforts. They are bracing for the national spotlight \u2014 and the concurrent firehose of outside money \u2014 to turn to Kentucky. Kentucky is more conservative than Kansas \u2014 it went for Trump by 26 points \u2014 but some dynamics are similar, with a small number of blue counties set in a sea of red. But the margin of victory for abortion rights supporters in Kansas was so large that it has sparked concern in Wuchner's group and others. \"We're just now analyzing to see what we can learn,\" she said. In addition to Kentucky, ballot measures on abortion rights will appear in two blue states, California and Vermont. Another is expected in Michigan, where abortion rights supporters recently turned in a record number of signatures for a proposed amendment. A poll by the Pew Research Center conducted last month found that 62% of Americans believe that abortion should be legal in all or most cases. The results in Kansas showed a 10- to 15-point swing in many counties from the 2020 presidential election results to Tuesday's vote, suggesting that abortion is an issue that can defy partisan lines. \"The results in Kansas are reflective of what we're seeing nationwide and here in Michigan: Voters are energized and motivated to fight back to protect their health and rights following the elimination of the federal constitutional right to abortion,\" said Ashlea Phenicie, a spokesperson at Planned Parenthood Advocates of Michigan, one of the groups supporting the Michigan ballot measure.

Campaign tactics that work in Kansas may not be right for a swing state like Michigan or Florida, said Rachel Rebouche, a professor of reproductive and family law at Temple University. \"What voters will respond to will depend on where they are, will depend on the culture they find themselves in,\" she said in an interview with NPR. In Kansas, the pro-abortion rights campaign found success in messages about autonomy and government overreach. (One TV ad paired the words \"government mandate\" with a photograph of a sign asking business customers to wear face masks.) Many of its mailers and advertisements avoided the word \"abortion\" altogether. \"It really wove together a set of messages around consequences, but also appealing to what the campaign believed Kansas voters would respond to,\" said Rebouche. Other advertisements in Kansas framed the proposed amendment as too extreme for Kansans, pointing to language that would have allowed legislators to pass abortion restrictions, \"including, but not limited to, laws that account for circumstances\" of rape, incest or in which a mother's life is endangered. That language \"may have been a factor\" in the measure's failure, said Wuchner of Kentucky Right to Life, who called the wording \"confusing.\" \"The people aren't used to having to debate all the matters of fact that legislators are. And it may have just been a little bit too much wording,\" she said. That may have opened the door for the amendment's opponents to \"scaremonger and fearmonger,\" she added. Kentucky's ballot measure is simpler. It would amend the state's constitution to read: \"To protect human life, nothing in this Constitution shall be construed to secure or protect a right to abortion or require the funding of abortion.\" By contrast, the proposed amendment in Michigan \u2014 which would add protection for abortion rights to the state constitution, rather than remove them like in Kansas or Kentucky \u2014 is much more complicated, clocking in at more than 300 words. (Even though the measure is not yet officially on the ballot, its language already has come under criticism from abortion rights opponents.) Another variable could be the broader range of choices facing voters in November. In Kansas, only voters registered with a specific party may vote in that party's primary, meaning that any unaffiliated voter cast a ballot on Tuesday that included only the abortion question. In November, voters will be weighing other races too, choosing between candidates with positions on a variety of issues. That could drive turnout based on different issues \u2014 including inflation, which is named by Republican voters as a \"very important\" issue much more often than abortion, according to new polls by YouGov and the Kaiser Family Foundation. \"No matter what, we're going to treat it like an uphill battle, because we need to give every effort and every resource we have to defeat this amendment,\" said Crankshaw of the ACLU of Kentucky.",

On Tuesday, voters in Kansas overwhelmingly rejected a ballot initiative that would have opened the door to significant abortion restrictions in the state. It was the first political test of voters' appetite for state abortion restrictions since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June. The decisive vote against curbing abortion rights in a deeply conservative state has political strategists in both parties recalibrating their views on the upcoming midterm elections. \"Well, [Tuesday] night was a slap in the face to me, personally, as a consultant who's done this for 32 years,\" said Chuck Rocha, a senior Democratic operative. \"When this decision came down from the Supreme Court, I was one of those folks who said that if this is your issue, you've already picked a team \u2014 you're already team red or you're team blue, and this will have some effect, but not a major effect.\" But after seeing the staggering number of voters who turned out in a state that former President Donald Trump won by 15 points in 2020, Rocha thinks abortion rights will end up playing a larger role in the November elections. \"This proved there is energy here around this issue, and I think [Tuesday] was historic,\" he said. Republican strategist John Feehery said the Kansas outcome should be a \"wake-up call\" for Republicans. \"Republicans in the pro-life movement need to get their act together on the abortion issue post-Dobbs, because they're all over the place,\" he said. \"The problem is that you have people wanting to be the most conservative candidate in the primary, but they take positions that are not that popular with most voters. So they need to tread carefully, they need to calibrate, they need to understand where most voters are \u2014 and most voters are in the middle. They are not on either extreme.\" He said GOP candidates need to be explicit that their views on abortion have \"nothing to do with same-sex marriage, and certainly not contraception,\" two  issues that Democrats have forced votes on in Congress to get their Republican colleagues on record for supporting or opposing, amid concerns that the Supreme Court's ruling could jeopardize other rights. Last month, 195 House Republicans voted against legislation aimed at protecting access to birth control. Feehery said although Tuesday's outcome boosts enthusiasm among Democrats nationally, the \"saving grace\" for Republicans is that abortion is not the No. 1 issue facing the country. \"Inflation and the economy are much more important for most voters, and I think that that's what they'll vote on,\" Feehery said. According to a recent NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll, inflation is the No. 1 issue for Republicans and independent voters as they think about the midterm elections; registered Democrats rank abortion first. Although the result of Kansas' vote came as a surprise, it was the scope of voters who turned out in droves that stunned Tom Bonier, CEO of TargetSmart, a Democratic data firm. \"When you you analyze data, you tend to get excited when you see movements from the norm, maybe five or six points \u2014 that's telling you that something meaningful happened, something outside of the norm. And in this case, we saw something outside of the norm by 20 points,\" he said. \"I've never seen anything to that extent in terms of that intensity.\" Over 900,000 people in Kansas cast a ballot on Tuesday, a level of participation that blows past primary turnouts out of the water and approaches the high turnout rate in the state in the 2018 general election. Republicans have a substantial voter registration advantage in the state. \"[The results] prove that Democrats can probably peel off some of these moderate Republican women, who take this issue very personally,\" Rocha said. Bonier analyzed voter registration numbers before and after June 24, when the Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to abortion. \"What we saw there was remarkable,\" Bonier said. \"Seventy percent of the new voter registrants in Kansas were women. If you look at the same period of time in the previous election cycle, new voter registrants were almost exactly evenly split between men and women.\" The Dobbs decision engaged women in Kansas to an unprecedented degree. This chart shows the percent of new registrants in the state who were women (as a 7 day average). Note the spike after the Dobbs decision leaked, and huge jump after the Supreme Court handed it down. pic.twitter.com/pvi3WpuR86 Bonier also points to the number of young people who registered to vote in the wake of the Supreme Court decision  \u2014 over half are under the age of 25. \"In the 2018 general election, much of that so-called blue wave was driven by just a massive, unprecedented increase in youth turnout. So the question we're asking ourselves at this point is, is what we saw in Kansas this week the first indicator of something similar happening in in 2022, and will we see a huge increase in women participating in this election that could produce surprising results?\" Rocha points out that demographic shifts will play a role in November as well. \"For the first time in American political history, voters of color will have a bigger impact on who controls Congress. This particular issue of choice over-indexes and impacts people with less income, mainly young women of color,\" he said, pointing to key Senate races in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Georgia, Arizona and Nevada. \"If [abortion] is a motivational factor, and that was proven on Tuesday, to motivate young Black and brown voters, especially young Black and brown women, it could be the sleeping giant of this year, and will be a story that will be told for a long time.\" This year, a record number of abortion measures are on state ballots and the issue will be a factor in other races in November up and down the ballot, including for governor, Senate, House, state supreme courts and state attorneys general. Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster, said in the wake of the Supreme Court decision, anti-abortion rights voters \"think they've won, so they're not as energized.\" \"We're seeing the pro-choice voters and women in particular, younger women and baby boomer women who remember what it was like before Roe v. Wade, getting very energized and being 10 to 20 points more energized than the anti-choice voters,\" she said. \"That is a sea change.\" She's heard in focus groups from voters who are concerned about a \"slippery slope\" \u2014 the idea that curtailing abortion rights could lead to other rights being rolled back. \"They worry about marriage equality, they worry about voting rights protections, they worry about birth control, they worry about abortion,\" Lake described. \"Voters in our focus groups ask, 'What's next?'\" Mallory Carroll, vice president of communications of Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, said the results from Kansas are a \"devastating loss\" to the anti-abortion rights movement. \"The question now is, what lesson will pro-life Republicans learn from this disappointing loss?\" She said Republican candidates should be \"very explicit\" about their stances, including whether there are instances in which they think abortion should be allowed, and not shy away from tackling the topic head on. \"Republicans need to quit what they're doing right now, which in many cases is to pretend like this issue [of abortion] doesn't exist and focus instead on inflation, gas prices, crime, etc., to carry them over the finish line,\" she said. \"There's no doubt those are very salient issues that voters care about. But if pro-life Republicans fail to define themselves and what their policy positions are, then pro-abortion Democrats will do that for them.\" Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas listens as President Biden delivers remarks virtually during the first meeting of the interagency Task Force on Reproductive Healthcare Access on Wednesday.\n                \n                    \n                    Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas listens as President Biden delivers remarks virtually during the first meeting of the interagency Task Force on Reproductive Healthcare Access on Wednesday. \"The court practically dared women in this country to go to the ballot box and restore the right to choose,\" President Biden said Wednesday as he met virtually with White House's Task Force on Reproductive Health Care. Republicans and the high court \"don't have a clue about the power of American women,\" Biden said. \"Last night in Kansas, they found out.\" During that meeting, Biden signed his second executive order aimed at preserving abortion access. The order directs the Department of Health and Human Services to \"consider action to advance access to reproductive healthcare services, including through Medicaid for patients who travel out of state for reproductive healthcare services.\" The order directs HHS to \"consider all appropriate actions\" to ensure health care providers comply with non-discrimination laws in order for people to receive \"medically necessary care without delay,\" noting that providers may be \"confused or unsure of their obligations in the aftermath of the Supreme Court decision.\" But Biden himself has acknowledged the limits of what he and his administration can do to fully protect abortion rights. He's repeatedly issued the message of \"vote, vote, vote\" in November to boost Democrats' numbers in Congress in order to codify abortion rights into federal law and bring the legislation to his desk for signature.",

Stephanie Clayton, an abortion rights supporter who was a Republican and is now a Democrat, reacts as a referendum to strip abortion rights out of the state constitution fails. LAWRENCE, Kan. \u2014 Voters in Kansas rejected a proposed state constitutional amendment Tuesday that would have said there was no right to an abortion in the state, according to The Associated Press. Kansas was the first state to vote on abortion rights since the U.S. Supreme Court handed down its ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson's Women's Health Organization. President Joe Biden hailed Tuesday's vote and called on Congress to pass a law to restore nationwide abortion rights that were provided by Roe. \"This vote makes clear what we know: the majority of Americans agree that women should have access to abortion and should have the right to make their own health care decisions,\" Biden said in a statement. Kansas For Constitutional Freedom, the main abortion rights group opposing the amendment, called the victory \"huge and decisive.\" \"The people of Kansas have spoken,\" said Rachel Sweet, campaign manager for the group. \"They think that abortion should be safe, legal and accessible in the state of Kansas.\" This year, a record number of abortion questions will be on state ballots, and many are asking Kansas' decision Tuesday will be an indicator of what is to come. In the lead-up to the vote, supporters of the amendment argued that it was necessary to correct what they say was the Kansas Supreme Court's overreach in striking down some of the state's previous abortion restrictions in 2019. Opponents argued that the amendment would set state lawmakers up to pursue a total abortion ban. Struggling to speak after the race was called, 23-year-old Jae Moyer said the decisive victory in the red state was surprising. \"It's never looked like this in Kansas,\" Moyer said. \"It's so amazing. I'm so proud of my state right now.\" Planned Parenthood donated millions of dollars to the opposition effort. \"Anti-abortion politicians put this amendment on the primary ballot with the goal of low voter turnout,\" said Emily Wales of Planned Parenthood Great Plains Votes, \"but they discounted Kansans, who said loud and clear they believe and trust patients to make their own medical decisions.\" Access to abortion in Kansas remains limited. The state has only four clinics where abortions remain available, all in the Wichita and Kansas City areas. That leaves many Kansans in the western part of the state hundreds of miles away from abortion care. Many are closer to abortion providers in other states, like Colorado. Trust Women, which operates two of the clinics in Kansas, said it will continue providing abortion care while also working to expand access throughout the state. \"We cannot be content with the status quo,\" the organization said. \"The loss of Roe has brought with it an unprecedented and manufactured health care crisis that is not solved by this election.\" Kansans For Life, a major political group that opposes abortion rights, said in a news release that the vote is a temporary setback and the organization remains dedicated to continuing its work opposing abortion. \"While the outcome is not what we hoped, our movement and campaign have proven our resolve and commitment,\" the organization said. \"We will not abandon women and babies.\" But it's unclear what else can be done to further restrict abortion in Kansas. Republican state Sen. Molly Baumgardner, who supported sending the amendment to voters,  said abortion opponents will need to look at new restrictions to try to decrease the number of abortions in the state. \"The defeat this evening is disappointing,\" she said. \"That struggle for truth, and the struggle for life, is going to continue in the state of Kansas.\" Republicans, for the most part, remained quiet before Tuesday and wouldn't say how far they wanted to restrict abortion access if the amendment passed. Kansas' abortion restrictions already include limiting abortions after 22 weeks of pregnancy to cases where the pregnant person's life is in danger. The state also requires an ultrasound before a procedure. Those restrictions would have remained in place whether the amendment passed or failed. The vote in this red state may be a sign of what's to come in other abortion votes around the country later this year.",

The Trump-backed Masters is aiming to challenge Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly in the fall. August is a busy month for midterm election primaries, with Arizona, Michigan,  Missouri, Kansas and Washington starting off the calendar on Tuesday. We're keeping an eye on races where former President Donald Trump's picks are in play, and contests where he's targeted Republicans who voted to impeach him. We're watching the number of 2020 election deniers who are on the ballot Tuesday, including two GOP candidates running for secretary of state in Arizona, which President Biden narrowly won in the last election. And in Kansas, abortion rights are on the ballot \u2014 the first test of voter sentiment since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. Here's a breakdown of what to watch for. All eyes are on Kansas, where voters will decide whether to change the state constitution to potentially allow the legislature to further restrict or ban abortion. As of now, abortion is considered a fundamental right in the state, thanks to a 2019 Kansas Supreme Court ruling. And earlier this summer in Michigan, Republicans in the state legislature introduced a measure that would enforce an abortion ban from 1931. Incumbent Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has vowed not to let that happen and has made the issue a signature part of her campaign for reelection, which is shaping up to be a tight race. On the Republican side, candidates include Tudor Dixon, a businesswoman and former TV commentator, chiropractor Garrett Soldano and businessman Kevin Rinke. Dixon, who is backed by former U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and \u2014 since this past weekend \u2014 Trump, has had a lead in recent polling. Arizona: In the GOP gubernatorial primary Trump has backed Kari Lake, a former television host who has spread lies about the 2020 election, while other Republicans \u2014 including former Vice President Mike Pence and current Gov. Doug Ducey \u2014 have endorsed her main opponent, Karrin Taylor Robson. On the Senate side in Arizona, Trump's pick is Blake Masters, former chief operating officer of the investment firm Thiel Capital. Masters' campaign has been boosted by millions of dollars from Peter Thiel, his longtime friend and boss. Masters is in the race alongside businessman Jim Lamon, state Attorney General Mark Brnovich and Michael McGuire, a retired National Guard major general. The GOP winner will then move to a highly contested race against incumbent Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly. Both Lake and Masters appear to have healthy leads in recent polling. Trump has also endorsed state Rep. Mark Finchem, who has denied the results of the 2020 election and sought to overturn it. He's now running to oversee voting in Arizona. He's one of two election deniers on the Republican ballot for secretary of state. Missouri: Trump opted not to make a last-minute endorsement in the race for Missouri's open U.S. Senate seat, instead backing \"ERIC\" \u2014 a nod at two of the leading candidates, state Attorney General Eric Schmitt and former Gov. Eric Greitens. Many Republicans have been concerned that the controversial Greitens would win the nomination, complicating GOP hopes of holding on to what's considered a safe seat. Kansas: In Kansas, the open race for attorney general includes Kris Kobach, a former secretary of state who unsuccessfully ran for governor in 2018. Trump has backed Kobach, who is a longtime ally of the former president. Also in the Republican field are candidates Tony Mattivi, a former federal prosecutor, and state Sen. Kellie Warren. Chris Mann, a former prosecutor and police officer, is unopposed on the Democratic side. Kobach's failed gubernatorial candidacy in 2018 meant the state got a Democratic governor with Laura Kelly. Kelly is now running for reelection in a race that's considered a toss-up. She's facing a primary challenge from accountant Rich Karnowski in her own party. And on the Republican side, Trump has endorsed the state's current attorney general, Derek Schmidt, for the seat. Ten House Republicans voted to impeach Trump after the Jan. 6 insurrection. Three are on the ballot Tuesday \u2014 and facing tough battles to get reelected. In Washington's 3rd Congressional District, Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler is being challenged from the right by Joe Kent, a former member of the U.S. Army Special Forces, and Heidi St. John, a  podcaster and homeschool advocate. Trump has backed Kent, who also has falsely said the 2020 election was stolen. At a rally last week, Trump said of Herrera Beutler, \"She voted for the radical Democrats' second impeachment hoax where the Republicans stood up tall for me but she didn't.\" Herrera Beutler, for her part, has been running a campaign as a more \"independent\" candidate. In the state's 4th District, Rep. Dan Newhouse has a similar fight. He's facing challengers including the Trump-endorsed Loren Culp, a former town chief of police, who ran for governor in 2020 and would not concede following his loss. And rounding out the three in Michigan's 3rd Congressional District is Rep. Peter Meijer, who is facing a challenge from Trump pick John Gibbs, a former Trump administration official. Democrats have controversially meddled in the race, promoting Gibbs' conservative credentials under the belief that he'd be easier to beat in one of Democrats' top pickup opportunities.",

Biden told the governors he wants to find new ways to protect abortion rights and access after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade one week ago. \"I share the public outrage of this extremist court that's committed to moving America backward, with fewer rights and less autonomy,\" Biden said in opening comments. The president reiterated that the attorney general's office will work to protect the ability to cross state lines for abortion services and protect access to contraceptives and abortion medication. Joining the president for the roundtable were New York's Kathy Hochul, New Mexico's Michelle Lujan Grisham, Illinois' JB Pritzker, Colorado's Jared Polis, Connecticut's Ned Lamont, North Carolina's Roy Cooper, Oregon's Kate Brown, Rhode Island's Daniel McKee and Washington's Jay Inslee \u2014 many whose states border others that have trigger laws going into effect this summer that limit or outlaw abortion after the Supreme Court's action. Hochul said she hopes her state will be a \"safe harbor\" for those seeking abortion services. New York has allocated $35 million to providers to hire more staff and increase protections and resources for their staff. \"The rights of millions of women across this country are now falling on the shoulders of just a handful of states,\" Hochul said, asking Biden to allow people in states that limit abortion to utilize federal buildings for services. Cooper and Lujan Grisham noted that their states are already seeing an influx of patients who are seeking services from other states. \"Part of the conversation needs to be what resources are being given to states that will have abortion access so that they can support the influx of people and support the people in their own state who will need care,\" Lupe Rodriguez, executive director of National Latina Institute for Reproductive Justice and one of the advocates meeting with the White House, told NPR ahead of the event. Currently, it is not illegal for those seeking abortion services to travel to other states. But some abortion opponents are looking to implement laws that could lead to limitations or legal battles against those who sought or facilitated an abortion. In recent days, the Health and Human Services Department announced $3 million in new funding to increase training and technical assistance for family planning providers. The money will help Title X grantees increase training and technical assistance to address the challenges that the recent Supreme Court decision could have on their Title X Family planning service delivery, according to the department. HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra has also met with governors this week \u2014 Michigan's Gretchen Whitmer, Oregon's Brown and Maine's Janet Mills \u2014 to go over efforts in their states. And Becerra, along with Labor Secretary Marty Walsh, met with health insurers and employee benefit plan leaders to discuss their obligations to ensuring access to contraception medications in employee plans. The pair, along with Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, sent a letter to insurance industry leaders, reminding them of their obligations to provide access and coverage of birth control and contraceptive counseling. Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris have also continued to push for voters to take the Supreme Court's decision into account when voting in the remaining primaries and general midterm election this November. On Thursday, Biden spoke out in favor of throwing out the filibuster in the Senate for key exceptions like voting rights and abortion measures. Democrats have been unable to round up 10 Republicans needed to help clear the 60-vote hurdle on a bill to codify abortion protections in the Senate. However, only 50 votes are needed to change the filibuster rules. But some Democrats, namely Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, have consistently opposed any effort to rid the filibuster, including over abortion. Biden acknowledged during the event that Democrats don't have the votes in the Senate, urging voters to turn out for candidates who could support a bill to codify abortion rights following the midterms.

Jackson Women's Health Organization ruling in front of the U.S. Supreme Court on June 24, 2022. The rage among pro-abortion-rights protesters in front of the Supreme Court over the weekend was palpable. Plenty of that anger was aimed at the high court, but there was also quite a bit reserved for Democrats.\u200b \"I'm not hopeful at this point that this is something that will be federally protected. I have as little faith in Democrats at this point as I did in Republicans,\" Carolyn Yunker said Saturday. She traveled down to the court from her home in D.C.'s Maryland suburbs.\u200b \"Democrats have used this for 50 years to fundraise. They had opportunities to codify Roe,\" she said. \"They chose not to because being the pro-choice candidate in an election helps you raise money. And frankly, I'm pretty disgusted with a lot of our representatives right now.\" Since the May leak of Justice Samuel Alito's draft opinion overturning Roe v. Wade, Democrats' main message to their voters has been that abortion is on the ballot in November. But many who support abortion rights have been voting, and, like Yunker, they're frustrated that electing Democrats hasn't produced more results. In the fall, House Democrats did pass a bill that would have made Roe's protections federal law. But it failed in the Senate in May, where it would need 60 votes to overcome a filibuster. Some abortion rights supporters want the Senate to blow up the filibuster, but Democrats haven't unified behind that idea, and President Joe Biden hasn't pushed for it. He has also resisted calls to expand the court. Biden is the leader of the party that supports abortion rights, but since the ruling, his visibility as part of the response has been limited. Immediately after the ruling, he gave a statement, but the White House also canceled the daily press briefing, and he left for a major summit in Europe. His fellow Democrats are not satisfied. Over the weekend, 34 senators urged Biden in a letter to lead a national response. A White House official emphasized that the administration will support medication abortion and cited dozens of discussions with abortion-rights stakeholders. The White House also says policy action is coming this week. Meanwhile, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Monday afternoon that House Democrats are exploring legislation to protect data on period-tracking apps and protect the right to travel between states. She also said the House may again vote on legislation to codify Roe. Long-term change, however, will be the result of more voting. That means winning over new voters like 19-year-old Pryia Thompson, who went to the Supreme Court on Saturday with her grandmother. As a new voter who supports abortion rights, she's feeling ambivalent about her vote.\u200b \"Honestly, I'm just getting started, and all of this is happening, so it's hard to make decisions and know who to vote for, who's really for us,\" she said. For years now, the overwhelming majority of Democratic candidates have been running as supporters of abortion rights. With Roe overturned, Democratic candidates like Sarah Godlewski, running for Senate in Wisconsin, will be working to have a stronger message \u2014 to tell voters that they truly will prioritize protecting abortion rights if elected. \"This is one of the reasons why I stepped up to run for the U.S. Senate, was that I was getting sick of reproductive freedom being treated like some sort of extra credit project,\" she said. While this anger is prominent in the abortion rights movement, there's also an acknowledgement that some supporters grew complacent during the half century that Roe was in effect. \"There is a tendency for people who've had a right to sort of assume that that's the way it is and it won't be challenged,\" said Aimee Allison, founder of She The People, which promotes women candidates of color. \"And even when we heard that the Supreme Court was planning to overturn Roe v. Wade, it didn't sink in for many people that this was actually a threat realized and it was going to have an effect on our lives.\" Right now, she's focused on electing Senate candidates who could help eliminate the filibuster and ease the way for abortion protections to pass. \"If we can elect these women of color, we'll have the votes in order to pass the legislation that went through the House and a sitting at the Senate to restore abortion rights and make reproductive justice a reality,\" she added. In the short and medium-term, some are focused on abortion access. Laura Kriv was among a small group protesting in front of Justice Brett Kavanaugh's house on Saturday night. \u200b \"Just like the Janes started this movement years ago and and took it upon themselves to make sure women had safe access to abortion, we're going to have to do the same thing,\" she said, referring to the Jane Collective that helped women seeking abortions in the 1960s and 1970s. . Kriv added that that is going to be more of a focus for her than watching what politicians say. \"I'm not going to wait for the politicians. I'm certainly not going to wait for Biden,\" she said. \"I would love it if he would expand the court so that more of our rights aren't taken away. But I'm not going to sit back and wait.\" With activists motivated to do so much to protect abortion access right now, it's not clear how much they see voting this November as a solution.",

            "article_content": "Thousands of abortion-rights activists gather in front of the U.S. Supreme Court after it overturned the landmark Roe v Wade case and erased a federal right to an abortion.\n                \n                    \n                    Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Thousands of abortion-rights activists gather in front of the U.S. Supreme Court after it overturned the landmark Roe v Wade case and erased a federal right to an abortion. It's hard to overstate the importance of what the Supreme Court did Friday with its outright overturning of Roe v. Wade, the landmark ruling that made abortion legal in this country nearly 50 years ago. \"It's the legal equivalent of a nuclear bomb,\" NPR's Nina Totenberg, the dean of Supreme Court reporters, noted, adding that it's possible this ruling opens the door for the potential \"for undoing other areas of personal autonomy,\" from contraception to interracial marriage. There are lots of questions we have about what happens now to society and in politics. Here are six: 1. What happens for access to abortion now? The Supreme Court is leaving it to the states to decide how to regulate \u2013 or outlaw \u2013 abortion. Twenty-two states have trigger laws in place that will outlaw abortion immediately. Almost all are in red states, or places Donald Trump won in the presidential election. The U.S. is now going to have a patchwork of laws. In red states with legislatures controlled by Republicans, an abortion is likely to be banned or made much more difficult to get. And in blue states, places Democrats traditionally win in presidential elections and control the legislatures, abortion access will remain in place. It will make for a very unsettling round of new laws and regulations across the country. 2. Does the court go further, after other rights? Justice Thomas wrote that he wants the court to reexamine precedents on cases dealing with contraception, same-sex marriage and even same-sex sex. Other conservative justices said they disagree with that, but few thought the Supreme Court would go even this far and outright overturn Roe. One thing is clear, this isn't Chief Justice Roberts' court anymore. He wrote a concurrent opinion advocating for upholding Mississippi's 15-week ban, but not to go beyond that. The court's conservative supermajority didn't listen. It's their court now. If they band together, there's no telling how they can \u2013 and will \u2013 reshape American society and culture. 3. What will this mean for the Supreme Court's credibility? Public opinion has been clear and consistent \u2013 a solid majority of Americans want abortion, with restrictions, to remain legal, but the Supreme Court opinion outright overturning Roe is woefully out of step with the American public. The court's credibility has declined and opinion of it has become more polarized this year. With the leak of the Roe draft opinion in May, it took a nosedive. Gallup released numbers on Thursday that showed just 25% now say they have a \"great deal\" or \"quite a lot\" of confidence in the Supreme Court. That's the lowest in the 50 years that Gallup has been asking the question. 4. Will the idea of doing away with the filibuster and packing the court become more mainstream? Expect there to be a movement among progressives to add more justices to the court. \"The idea of adding Supreme Court justices, which I thought didn't have a leg to stand on, I think, at some point, may have traction,\" Totenberg noted. Democrats don't have the votes for that at this point. But given the court's credibility problem \u2013 and how far out of step overturning Roe is with the broader public \u2013 do these ideas start to catch on? 5. How do Democrats and liberals respond more broadly? It took half a century of meticulous planning, vetting and building a movement to get to this point for anti-abortion-rights conservatives. They have not only mobilized for presidential elections, but also down-ballot ones, like state legislative races. Democrats have built up some apparatus to compete in those races in recent years after being largely absent for a decade or so, before and during the Obama administration. But with the relative young ages of the Supreme Court nominees and the stranglehold Republicans have on many statehouses across the country, this is an aircraft carrier that's likely to take a very long time to turn \u2013 certainly far longer than one or two election cycles. 6. Will it shake up the 2022 election? While surveys show that Roe being overturned would fire up Democrats to vote more than Republicans, the decision is unlikely to change the forecast for control of the House. Republicans are favored to take the House and that's unlikely to change. So far, in the short term, people say they are more concerned about inflation and gas prices as motivating factors. But this ruling undoubtedly introduces a wildcard. And it will be important to closely watch how the political landscape moves in the coming weeks. This ruling not only will affect this upcoming election but the next one \u2013 the 2024 presidential election. That is especially true considering former President Trump is the frontrunner for the GOP nomination, and it's because of his Supreme Court nominations that this day is here. It would have been a very different world had Hillary Clinton won in 2016.",

All 50 states would suddenly have the power to decide when and if abortion should be legal if the U.S. Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade, but that won't just be a question for lawmakers. State courts, attorneys general and even district attorneys would be thrust onto the frontlines of this debate. Who holds those offices will matter. In Michigan, Democratic Attorney General Dana Nessel called a 90-year-old abortion ban still on the books, \"draconian\" \u2013 and promised not to enforce it. In Georgia, Jen Jordan, a Democratic candidate for attorney general, said she'd challenge a restrictive abortion law in state courts. \"They told us this road is cut off, where do we go next? Where we go next is the Georgia Constitution,\" Jordan says. As news of the draft ruling spread, Democratic attorneys general, governors and state legislators pledged to fight back, highlighting the stakes of their races in the 2022 midterm elections, hoping abortion rights could motivate voters. Former Maine Attorney General James Tierney knows a thing or two about the job. He has been a go-to adviser for state attorneys general and teaches a class on them at Harvard Law School. He says some people even call him the \"fifty-first attorney general.\" Tierney says attorneys general have immense discretion. They can choose to challenge a restrictive abortion law in court \u2013 or defend it. \"It's always important who sits in the attorney general's office. Always. Not just political party but what they argue, how they argue,\" Tierney says. \"Does who sits in the AG's office end the story? And the answer is clearly no.\" In many states, abortion could carry criminal penalties. What attorneys general typically can't do is decide whether or not to enforce them. In some states, district attorneys have sole responsibility for criminal prosecutions. In other states, that authority is shared with the attorney general, Tierney says. And in some states, the attorney general can override a district attorney, but only if the governor intervenes. In Georgia, it's up to district attorneys to make that call. Voters should be asking their district attorney to make their position clear, says Sherry Boston, the district attorney for DeKalb County, Georgia. \"I have people ask me all the time: 'What is your position on the possession of drugs? What is your position on gun charges?' If we can answer every single one of those questions, and we do, then there's absolutely no reason not to answer this question about how you intend to handle abortion if it becomes criminal.\" While Boston says she would not prosecute abortion providers, patients and people who help them, district attorneys in some counties likely would. District attorneys by design have wide prosecutorial discretion. \"When I see laws that will divide people on living in the margins, based on their economic situation, based on their race, because we know access to abortion becomes more difficult for black and brown people, then it is my job to use my discretion to lessen those inherent inequalities that exist,\" Boston says. Criminal charges aside, some state constitutions may be interpreted not to allow these restrictive abortion laws at all. A U.S. Supreme Court ruling overturning a federal right to abortion leaves the decision to states \u2013 and any state abortion laws would be weighed against that state's constitution. Privacy rights are the foundation of Roe v. Wade, and Georgia's constitution has its own strong privacy protections, which stem back to a 1905 court case brought by an artist named Paola Pavesich. How did the right to privacy emerge in the Georgia Constitution? It started with Paolo Pavesich who was angry about being featured in this ad published by the @ajc. Georgia's Supreme Court held in 1905 that his natural right to \"withdraw from the public gaze\" was violated. #gapol pic.twitter.com/cUKILFrLms A photograph of Pavesich appeared without his permission in a life insurance advertisement in the Atlanta Constitution newspaper, says Anthony Michael Kreis, a Georgia State University law professor. Pavesich sued, and the Georgia Supreme Court ruled in his favor. \"The court put it as the right to withdraw from public gaze,\" Kreis says. \"Just leave me alone. And if I'm not bothering anybody, then the state should really have to produce a compelling interest in disturbing my peace.\" The courts have applied Pavesich to other legal questions, including as the basis for overturning Georgia's anti-sodomy law. Abortion could prove more complicated. If Roe falls and Georgia's restrictive abortion law is allowed to take effect, the law would define an embryo as a person once cardiac activity is detected. A court could determine that an embryo's growth overrides a pregnant person's privacy rights. \"When you're dealing with these amorphous terms like 'privacy' or 'equality', there's a lot more room for people's subjective understanding of those terms to come into effect,\" Kreis says. Kreis says these debates could boil over in lots of states, with lawmakers, courts and the public all trying to interpret their state's laws as a 50-year-old right to abortion is overturned.",

            "article_content": "We look at what the leaked Supreme Court draft opinion on abortion means for midterm elections and what Congress can do to guard access to contraception and same-sex marriage from a similar fate.  SCOTT SIMON, HOST: The leaked U.S. Supreme Court draft decision published by Politico this week sent shockwaves through people and politics. The draft said that access to abortion, a right legally grounded in privacy, is not a constitutional right. And if this opinion holds, it would overturn Roe v. Wade, which has protected the right to have an abortion without excessive restrictions for half a century. President Biden said he believed the reasoning laid out in the draft decision would challenge other privacy-related rights, including same-sex marriage and access to contraception. We're joined now by NPR's senior Washington editor and correspondent Ron Elving. Ron, thanks so much for being with us. RON ELVING, BYLINE: Good to be with you, Scott. SIMON: What the president said sounded like alarms for those who've fought for causes like access to contraception and the right to same-sex marriage. Is this a rallying cry for Democrats, and do they have the votes? ELVING: Yes, it is certainly a rallying cry, and they will respond to that - Democrats - most of them. But on your second question, no, they do not have the votes for legislation that would protect abortion rights or same-sex marriage or any of the other rights. In the house, yes, but in the Senate, we are still living with the filibuster. It still takes 60 votes to cut off debate and proceed to a vote on legislation. So there will be an attempt to do that next week, probably on Wednesday. It will get all or nearly all the Democrats. It will be opposed by all or nearly all the Republicans. There could be one or two defections on either side, but that doesn't matter. They won't get 60, so it's moot. Yet it's a chance for senators to show their colors, to stand up and be counted, maybe make speeches, maybe make videos to show in their campaigns. That'll be its main value. And that depends on voters tuning in and engaging with this. Many Americans don't and won't. SIMON: Ron, if the draft decision comes about and Roe is overturned, could that galvanize the Democratic party and voters in the midterms? ELVING: Well, Democrats have said for years that everything would be different if the Republicans finally got their chance to repeal abortion rights and perhaps other rights regimes as well - to revisit the struggles of the '60s and '70s and reverse the perceived outcomes. Now we're going to see if they were right. You know, with Friday's robust jobs report, you can begin to imagine a Democrat's bumper sticker for this fall that says jobs, jobs, jobs and Dobbs, Dobbs, Dobbs. SIMON: Dobs, of course, refers to the Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, the 2018 Mississippi law that bans abortions after 15 weeks. Lower courts had ruled to prevent enforcement before it was brought to the Supreme Court. ELVING: That's right. I'm talking in Supreme Court code, calling it Dobbs. But in this case, lower federal courts had looked at these cases and looked to the Supreme Court for new guidance. You know, 50 years ago when Roe v. Wade burst on the American consciousness, at first no one knew what those names meant, either. But, you know, it's hard to find anyone who doesn't know Roe v. Wade now. Maybe one day that will be true of Dobbs. SIMON: And will Republicans try and capitalize politically off these results, too? ELVING: Some are going to play it down, stick to talking about inflation. That's what consultants advise. But campaigns, especially midterm campaigns, are not so much about persuading people in the middle. They're about motivating the people who already agree with you so they'll get out to the polls. So the Republicans will point to the Dobbs decision in some cases and say, see, we promised, and we delivered. Every vote to overturn Dobbs was a justice appointed by a president named Bush or Trump. SIMON: Pew Research Center polls hold that around 60% of Americans think abortion should be legal in all or most cases. So if this draft decision is an indication of what is likely to come, it seems like the Supreme Court would be out of step with the majority of U.S. opinion at a politically very divisive time. ELVING: Yes. And polls show the people who will be happy about this decision are concentrated in age groups 55 years and over. Now, I have no objection personally to people being 55 or older, but there is a certain expectation about what that means for politics in the years ahead. It's often been said that the court was out ahead of its skis in 1973 with the Roe ruling, but most Americans were not ready for it then. Now, understanding that the court is certainly free to be out of step with public opinion, whatever it is, there is a risk that this opinion goes too far. Some say Roe did. You could say the Dobbs opinion we saw this week was at least this aggressive. Was it too much so? The next political generation will tell us. SIMON: Ron Elving, thanks so much.

The Supreme Court ruled on Roe v. Wade in 1973, saying that access to abortion was protected in the United States. The decision fueled the anti-abortion movement and congealed it, too. Prior to Roe, anti-abortion activists were operating on a state level, but the Supreme Court's ruling turned the movement into a national one. In the decades before the decision, opposition to abortion was a fairly bipartisan issue. In fact, many Democrats in elected positions were likely to oppose unrestricting abortion access because many represented Catholics, who were largely opposed to abortion. But even then, it wasn't a politically charged topic. Now, the Court appears to be on the verge of overturning the right to an abortion, bringing a movement that transformed American politics over the past half century to its apex. In the past decade, Donald Trump was able to win the White House in no small part because he galvinized conservative evangelicals by pledging to appoint Supreme Court justices that would overturn Roe. It was a promise he fulfilled, even though Trump had previously supported abortion rights. But the history of organized opposition to abortion access started more than a century before Roe v. Wade, with roots in British common law. In the early days of the country, laws often reflected British common law, and when it came to abortion, the process was determined by quickening. Quickening meant the moment the pregnant person could feel the fetus move, which typically happened between the fourth and six month of pregnancy. At that time, it was the only way to truly confirm the pregnancy, so the thought of life beginning at conception wasn't a factor at all. Ending the pregnancy after the quickening period was considered illegal, but was just a misdemeanor. And even then, it was hard to prosecute because it was only the pregnant person who could attest to whether or not the fetus had moved. Abortions were accessible and largely without stigma at this time. But close to the mid 1800s, some doctors, who at the time were a mostly unorganized profession, sought to separate themselves from the healers and midwives who were also performing abortions. Doctors didn't have as much medical or institutional authority as they do today, and some in the profession pushed states to pass anti-abortion laws in order to tamp down on competition. These physicians, all of whom were men and who were backed by the newly founded American Medical Association, argued that they had more knowledge on embryos and that the heightened medical knowledge was necessary to determine when life began. It should be noted, though, that this claim of advanced knowledge didn't actually exist in the medical community. Historians note that this argument was mostly used as a way to take away women's bodily autonomy. Now, it was a doctor who could interpret their medical condition, rather than just relying on whether the pregnant individual could feel the fetus move. Their efforts worked. By the early 1900s, every state had made abortion illegal, though there were exceptions made if the life of the pregnant person was at risk. In terms of the movement, mostly nothing. In these decades leading up to Roe, abortion was for the most part illegal. Because of that, seeking abortions also became extremely dangerous, particularly for low-income pregnant people and people of color, especially Black women. In 1930, abortion was listed as the official cause of death for almost 2,700 women in the United States, though there were likely many more deaths that did not get recorded. In the 1940s when antibiotics were introduced, fewer were dying from illegal abortions, but thousands were still admitted into the hospital due to medical complications. By the middle of the 1960s, some states like Colorado liberalized their abortion laws, and anti-abortion movements started to crop up on the state level. But it was still not nationally talked about, or even politicized, the way it started to become in the 1970s. In a short answer, it changed a lot. \"All of a sudden, it moves from a movement in the states that are liberalizing to a nationwide movement,\" Jennifer Holland, a professor at the University of Oklahoma and scholar on the anti-abortion movement, tells NPR. \"They are able to point to sort of an oppressive federal government... and it really feeds into the argument that the United States is on a slippery slope toward genocide and fascism,\" Holland said, referring to language often used by the anti-abortion movement. Members of a Right to Life committee holding a banner reading 'Stop the slaughter now!' and a placard reading 'The Supreme Court Injustice' during a protest, location unspecified, 1974.\n                \n                    \n                    Peter Keegan/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Members of a Right to Life committee holding a banner reading 'Stop the slaughter now!' and a placard reading 'The Supreme Court Injustice' during a protest, location unspecified, 1974. Holland says that at this point, the anti-abortion movement strategically cast itself as a \"rights campaign\" and started to compare abortion to the Holocaust and the Dred Scott Supreme Court decision, which ruled that Black people in the U.S. did not have constitutional rights. \"With Roe, the movement is able to grasp on to a federal oppressor, as an entity that is... allowing genocide to be enacted,\" Holland said. By the mid-1970s, the anti-abortion movement becomes far more partisan. In 1976, the Republican Party added an anti-abortion stance in their party platform. And that's when they start to enlist more evangelicals into the anti-abortion movement, which was critical for the movement's expansion. Through the 1980s, Republican leaders such as Ronald Reagan won in elections thanks to the anti-abortion movement. The Supreme Court also ruled on Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey in 1992, making it easier for states to pass more restrictive abortion laws. By 1996, 86% of all counties in the U.S. did not have a known abortion provider. From the late 1990s into the early 2000s, socially conservative leaders like James Dobson start to become more critical of the Republican Party. For example, they didn't want Reagan to nominate Sandra Day O'Connor to the Supreme Court because she wasn't in line with the movement, but Reagan nominated her anyway. \"In the late 90s, you have all these big socially conservative leaders who say: no more... We don't agree in a big tent party,\" Holland said \"You really see the power of the anti-abortion movement to not only be a part of a party, but to really remake a party. And demand political uniformity on this issue,\" she said. Through the end of the 20th century and the decades since, there's been a concerted effort from Republicans to prioritize abortion restrictions in legislation and judicial appointees. Conservative organizations such as the Federalist Society have heavily influenced who leaders like former President Trump nominate to the courts. Trump pledged to select nominees off a list provided by the group, which has in part led to the conservative supermajority on the Supreme Court today. Former President Donald Trump galvizined support among conservative evangelicals by pledging to appoint Supreme Court justices who would overturn Roe v. Wade, even though he had previously supported abortion rights.\n                \n                    \n                    OLIVIER DOULIERY/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Former President Donald Trump galvizined support among conservative evangelicals by pledging to appoint Supreme Court justices who would overturn Roe v.

The Supreme Court's draft opinion that leaked Monday night effectively achieves what the anti-abortion movement has been aiming for for decades. But in public opinion, it's not a popular move at all. Several polls from the last few years show that a majority of Americans do not support banning abortion. For example a recent poll from ABC/Washington Post shows that 54% think Roe v. Wade should be upheld and only 28% say it should be overturned; 18% said they had no opinion. The unpopularity of overturning Roe isn't a new finding, either. Polling from CNN going back to 1989 shows that the percentage of Americans who support overturning Roe has never risen above 36%.

            "article_content": "NPR's Daniel Estrin speaks to Elizabeth Estrada of the National Latina Institute for Reproductive Justice about the spread of abortion misinformation in the Latino community.  DANIEL ESTRIN, HOST: Misinformation impacts all kinds of important issues from COVID-19 to the 2016 election, and especially now, abortion. People considering abortions can be hit with misinformation about its safety and legality, especially after the Supreme Court's Dobbs v. Jackson ruling overturned Roe v. Wade this summer. One group hard-hit by this type of misinformation has been the Latino or Latinx community. Elizabeth Estrada is with the National Latina Institute for Reproductive Justice and joins us now from the Bronx in New York. Welcome. ELIZABETH ESTRADA: Thanks, Daniel. It's nice to be with you. ESTRIN: Yeah, thanks for being here. Could you just start by telling us a little bit about your personal story, how you became active in reproductive health in the Latinx community? ESTRADA: I actually got activated when I had my first abortion, and I experienced firsthand all the barriers and stigma that's attached to such a simple procedure. And it really activated me. And I knew that I wanted to be involved in the fight for reproductive justice and for abortion access overall. ESTRIN: Well, walk us through a few examples of abortion misinformation affecting the Latino community today. What does it look like, actually? ESTRADA: Well, you know, much like my own experience, where you hear that abortion causes depression or may cause cervical cancer or infertility or that it's unsafe, that you might bleed out. But we know that abortion is one of the safest procedures out there, far safer than even childbirth. ESTRIN: Where are people getting this misinformation, these falsehoods? Is it online? Is it just things that their families tell them? ESTRADA: Oftentimes, the first source of information that you hear is your immediate circle. So if you are considering having an abortion or considering your options for pregnancy, you'll ask a friend. You'll ask a loved one or a family member. And depending on where that family member or loved one lands on the spectrum of their faith or how they feel about abortion, you will hear things that perhaps someone has heard in the church, perhaps someone has heard from a crisis pregnancy center or by following anti-abortion accounts online. My own family, that get information from WhatsApp, you know? - as an immigrant, you will get a foreword from your aunt of, like, a graphic saying abortion causes cancer or abortion causes depression; choose life, something like that. ESTRIN: So what has been the trend since the repeal of Roe v. Wade? ESTRADA: The trend that I've seen is really kind of like an amplification of this misinformation. When the Dobbs decision came down in July, we were out in the streets. We were protesting and trying to share information with our community members. And some of the community members that showed up to our protests were confused because they thought that abortion was already illegal or limited or restricted. Even in more progressive state like New York, there still exists this lack of information that doesn't get to our communities because often we get a lot of our information from Univision or Telemundo. And you're seeing this fearmongering around prosecution and criminalization of self-managed abortion. ESTRIN: So who is doing the targeting? I mean, is the Latinx community specifically targeted by misinformation? ESTRADA: My experience is that we are being targeted because when I look at these crisis pregnancy centers or the misinformation, oftentimes there's animation or graphics that reflect Black and brown people in them. And so for me, it's obvious to make the connection between who you're trying to target if the majority of these infographics or the placements of the publications are largely in Black and brown media and non-English-speaking communities because if we understand the medical industry as English-speaking people, it's still hard to advocate for yourself as a patient, get the right information, ask the right questions for someone who doesn't speak English. Then medical speak becomes even harder. ESTRIN: But who do you think is behind it? I mean, do you think these are people within the Latino community who want to impact their own community and convince women not to get abortions? Is this coming from the outside? ESTRADA: I believe that it has been a long game for the anti-abortion movement to target our communities, and they have done a good job of absorbing people within our own community through religion and anti-abortion rhetoric to kind of be the messengers of this disinformation. ESTRIN: What is being done now to counter this trend? ESTRADA: We have to shift into this place of just simply talking about abortion care. While policy and advocacy and activism is important, not everyone can do that. But what we can do is sit down to dinner and be honest and tell our loved ones why we support people's right to access abortion. ESTRIN: Elizabeth Estrada is with the National Latina Institute for Reproductive Justice. Thank you so much. ESTRADA: Thanks, Daniel. Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "A sheriff in the Kansas' largest county says he's investigating claims of election fraud \u2014 but hasn't provided evidence. This comes right as the state holds an referendum on abortion rights.  AYESHA RASCOE, HOST: There's a big election in Kansas this week. Voters will decide whether there's a constitutional right to an abortion. But hanging over the election is the shadow of the 2020 elections. The sheriff in the state's largest county says he's investigating claims of election fraud but won't provide specifics or evidence. And he's part of a larger movement of law enforcement officials who want to investigate elections. We're joined by Steve Vockrodt. He's the investigative editor of the Midwest Newsroom, a public media collaboration. Welcome. STEVE VOCKRODT, BYLINE: Thank you for having me. RASCOE: So can you tell us why this sheriff says he's investigating elections? And, I mean, is that even his job? VOCKRODT: The sheriff's name is Calvin Hayden. He's a Republican. And he spoke recently to a gathering of law enforcement officials who call themselves constitutional sheriffs. And they believe county sheriffs have more authority than anyone else in their county at any level of government. And at that gathering, they called on sheriffs to do more investigations of the 2020 and future elections. Investigating election fraud isn't really something that Kansas sheriffs really do. Their role in elections is usually around security at election offices or crimes like disorderly conduct at a polling place. Hayden says that before 2020, he didn't think anything was really wrong with elections in Johnson County, an area that includes Kansas City's suburbs. But that year, the county voted for Joe Biden. Here's Hayden at a recent gathering of constitutional sheriffs. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CALVIN HAYDEN: President Trump did not carry our county. First time since 1914 that Johnson County didn't vote Republican. Yeah. So it's kind of interesting. VOCKRODT: At that gathering, Hayden also noted that Johnson County is growing rapidly and that the new residents are, quote, \"moving some of their politics from the crummy places they live to my county, and it's not fun.\" RASCOE: OK, but that doesn't mean they're not allowed to vote. So has Hayden gotten any more specific about what his claims of fraud are? VOCKRODT: Hayden has said that he's received more than 200 tips from people who allege that they were witnesses or victims of fraud in Johnson County elections. But that's about as far as he's gone in terms of specifics. He said his investigation is a nonpartisan issue. So I asked for public records about things like incident reports or anything else based on these tips or anything related to his investigation. RASCOE: And what did you find? VOCKRODT: So his office provided me one incident report of just one tip among those 200 that he said he had. None of the major police departments in the county nor the Republican secretary of state had any evidence of election related crimes. And that incident report was about a 71-year-old woman who tried to vote early and alleged that some ballot-tampering law may have been violated. I couldn't get more details from her or the sheriff's department. I also got a memo that was written about a meeting where Hayden asked county election officials why ballot drop boxes were at public libraries in 2020 and whether the county would eliminate them for future elections. He also wanted his deputies to pick up ballots and be present during vote-counting. The county's attorney warned Hayden that his actions could look like he was trying to interfere with elections. RASCOE: This is a big election on Tuesday. The fate of legalized abortion is on the ballot. Like, how does that tie in to all of the things that we've been talking about? VOCKRODT: In addition to Hayden's vague claims about election fraud, some anti-abortion groups are also raising similar claims about ballot drop boxes and these kinds of vague allegations about fraud and this opaque investigation could feed into the narrative of a rigged election, just like in 2020, even if there's no evidence to back up the claims. Election officials here keep pointing out that the state's elections are well run, and there's been no evidence of fraud. And in 2020, Republicans generally did pretty well here. RASCOE: Steve Vockrodt is the investigative editor of the Midwest Newsroom. Thank you so much for speaking with us today. VOCKRODT: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.

            "article_content": "With midterms just weeks away, Democrats are focused on the issue of abortion rights. They are trying to use the Supreme Court's decision rolling back Roe v. Wade to motivate voters.  A MART\u00cdNEZ, HOST: President Biden is scheduled to make what the White House is billing as a major speech later today about abortion rights. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: Voters in some states are already casting ballots in the midterm election. Is the focus on abortion going to persuade more Democrats to fill out their ballots, and will it be enough for the party to keep its slim majorities in Congress? MART\u00cdNEZ: I'm going to pose that question and more to our senior political editor and correspondent Domenico Montanaro. All right. So what are the details of today's speech, and why is the White House saying that President Biden is focusing on this now? DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Well, the White House says this is part of the ongoing effort by the president and the administration to try and call attention to, quote, \"an assault on access to women's health care\" by Republican officials. And he'll likely talk about federal and state attempts at restricting abortion rights. Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris have been out there talking about this issue plenty over the last several months. But it's no coincidence that this is coming exactly three weeks to go until ballots have to be cast in these midterm elections. And abortion rights are playing a pretty prominent role all across the country. MART\u00cdNEZ: All right. So how has abortion rights been used in these elections, and has that focus made a difference? MONTANARO: Yeah. I mean, it's really changed so much in these elections. It's become Democrats' sharpest line of attack against Republicans since the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision in June, which overturned Roe - that had guaranteed the right to an abortion in this country. It's been so salient for Democrats because people were overwhelmingly opposed to the outright overturning of Roe. Now, we have seen Republicans and Democrats take some liberties in ads in many places. They're accusing the other of being extremists. And if you follow these ads, it seems like every candidate either wants no restrictions or no exceptions, even when that's actually not true in lots of cases. But overall, the divide is pretty clear between most Democrats and Republicans. And for Democrats, it's really been energizing. You know, they've seen huge sums of money and activism go into campaigns and a big surge of enthusiasm. When you combine that with how much Republicans were already fired up with them out of power, all signs here are really pointing to a record turnout for this midterm election. MART\u00cdNEZ: I know polls can be tough to trust, but they do continue to show that Americans list inflation as their top concern. So could Democratic candidates then be making a mistake and leaning too much into the abortion messaging? MONTANARO: Yeah, and that's pretty consistent across the board. And it's something that has worried some Democrats, especially in those swing districts. People like Elissa Slotkin, congresswoman in Michigan, have tried to make a point of talking about what she and other Democrats have done, and here's something she said in a recent debate about that. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ELISSA SLOTKIN: I authored a bill that said we should suspend the federal gas tax, pressured the president to open up the strategic national reserves because gas under - price of gas underlies so much of that inflation. And then taking costs off people's books - right? - passing prescription drug legislation that starts in January that lowers the price of insulin, of drugs in general, for anyone on Medicare. So it's not perfect. If there was a silver bullet on inflation, it would have been fired. MONTANARO: Yeah, so there's - the problem there is that it's difficult to make a positive case on inflation when there aren't easy fixes. And Democrats control White House - the White House and Congress. We know presidents get far more credit and far more blame for the economy than they deserve. And people are in a very sour mood right now. Seventy percent of people in our last poll said that the country is headed in the wrong direction, and voters are saying they trust Republicans more on the economy. That makes it much easier for Republicans to simply blame Democrats, especially in those swing districts, most of which are in center-right places. MART\u00cdNEZ: That's NPR's Domenico Montanaro.

The amendment would have greatly tightened abortion laws in the state.  A MART\u00cdNEZ, HOST: Voters in Kansas have rejected a ballot initiative that would have allowed lawmakers to significantly restrict abortion rights in the state. It's the first time voters have weighed in on the issue since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. ASMA KHALID, HOST: Yep. And the proposed amendment was rejected by a wide margin, with nearly 60% voting no. At an election watch party, abortion rights supporters were overjoyed. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ASHLEY ALL: You know, really, it's like - I'm speechless. Like, that's where we're at right now. (CHEERING) KHALID: That was Ashley All, spokesperson for Kansans for Constitutional Freedom, speaking to supporters. MART\u00cdNEZ: For more on what this means, we go to NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben, who's in the Sunflower State. Danielle, Kansas abortion laws will still remain in place. Remind us what those laws are right now. DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN, BYLINE: Sure. So right now Kansas allows abortion up to 22 weeks, and there are a number of restrictions on that. For example, there's a 24-hour waiting period that patients have to observe, and they also have to undergo an ultrasound before the procedure. Now, a big thing protecting the rights there are here is a 2019 state Supreme Court ruling that said the state Constitution protects the right to abortion. Now, this amendment we're talking about, had it passed, it would have removed that constitutional protection, which would have cleared the way for all sorts of restrictions, including potentially a ban on the procedure. And experts that I spoke with said it was very likely that strict laws on abortion would have passed. So the fight is over for now, though one Democratic state representative I talked to last night said she's prepared for what she's calling a Republican backlash in November to oust Democratic Governor Laura Kelly. MART\u00cdNEZ: But so far, it sounds like a big victory. Is it? KURTZLEBEN: For abortion rights supporters, this is a huge victory. I mean, first of all, we had limited polling ahead of this, and it said that this was going to be close, and it really wasn't. Furthermore, Kansas, as you know, is a pretty conservative state. A Democrat hasn't won the state's electoral votes since 1964. So this is a big win for abortion rights. Now, one way to look at this is that it's in part a reflection of what broad polling on abortion shows us - that most Americans want there to be at least some legal abortion. One more thing to note here is that the turnout was just huge. In 2018, primary turnout in the state was just north of 450,000. At latest count, more than 900,000 people voted on this measure. To be clear, Kansas isn't now a blue or purple state. There are plenty of independents and Republicans who voted no. They thought this was too extreme, and I talked to some of them myself. But look; in county after county, we saw the pro-abortion-rights vote far outperform what Joe Biden did in 2020, but come November, moderate voters may just be thinking about other issues, like inflation and crime, when they vote for Congress or governor. In other words, we shouldn't expect all these people to cross the aisle again. MART\u00cdNEZ: Yeah. But I was thinking, though, other states have ballot measures about abortion this year, so does this maybe tell us anything about how those measures might do? KURTZLEBEN: Sure. Well, I mean, one state to look to is Michigan, which is much purpler (ph). So this must be encouraging to abortion rights supporters there 'cause Kansas, of course, is just much redder. This also just shows that abortion can mobilize voters really heavily. Logically, this would probably encourage Democrats running against strongly anti-abortion-rights Republicans to lean hard into the issue. MART\u00cdNEZ: NPR political correspondent Danielle Kurtzleben. Thanks a lot. KURTZLEBEN: Yes, thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., introduced a bill to restrict abortion access nationwide. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., has introduced a bill to create a federal ban on abortions at 15 weeks in an attempt to force Republicans to adopt a partywide consensus on the issue. The move comes as Democrats have turned abortion into a rallying cry following the Supreme Court decision in June to overturn Roe v. Wade. Polls have consistently shown that a majority of voters oppose the end of federal abortion protections. Graham acknowledged at a press conference on Tuesday that the legislation has very little chance of becoming law in the near future, and that's not just because Democrats control Congress and the White House. The proposed legislation includes exceptions for rape, incest and the health of the mother but it has not received the backing of any GOP leaders. The effort is at odds with the views of many federally elected Republicans who have said the issue of abortion should be left to the states. Graham himself said the issue should be left to the states before reversing his position with this legislation. Today\u2019s decision by the Supreme Court is a long overdue constitutional correction allowing for elected officials in the states to decide issues of life. Graham told reporters that he has not spoken to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., about the bill. McConnell himself has largely avoided committing to any discussion of a federal abortion ban. In the days following the Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe, a conservative victory decades in the making, McConnell explicitly downplayed the chances of such a ban ever being enacted. \"It takes 60 votes in the Senate for either side to prevail on this issue,\" McConnell said at an event in his home state of Kentucky. \"So I think the democratic process on this issue is going to work out at the state level.\" White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre released a statement reaffirming Democrats' pledge to restore federal protections for abortion rights. \"Republicans in Congress are focused on taking rights away from millions of women,\" Jean-Pierre said. \"The President and Vice President are fighting for progress, while Republicans are fighting to take us back.\" Democrats have warned for months that Republicans would move ahead with a federal abortion ban if they win back control in Washington--a message that has helped drive an increase in voter registration among women in several states. The dynamic is particularly difficult for Republican candidates in places that aren't GOP strongholds, like Joe O'Dea who is running for Senate in Colorado. In a recent interview with NPR, O'Dea said he does not plan to support a federal abortion ban. \"I believe, the first five months, the mother has the choice,\" O'Dea said. \"After that, there should be some exceptions rape, incest, life of the mother. Those should be exceptions. And I'll vote that way and I've been consistent about it.\" But Graham said he thinks a federal abortion ban should be part of the campaign process and he wants his bill to represent the consensus view of the majority of groups opposing abortion rights. \"We are trying to basically normalize America here,\" Graham said. \"If we stay on this and keep talking about it maybe in a decade this will be law.\"",

JUANA SUMMERS, HOST: Since last month's leak of the draft opinion overturning Roe, Democrats' main message to their voters has been that abortion is on the ballot in November. But many who support abortion rights have been voting. They say they're frustrated that electing Democrats hasn't produced more results. NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben reports. DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN, BYLINE: The rage among pro-abortion rights protesters in front of the Supreme Court this weekend was palpable. Plenty of that anger was aimed at the high court, but there was also quite a bit reserved for Democrats. CAROLYN YUNKER: I'm not hopeful at this point that this is something that will be federally protected. I have as little faith in Democrats at this point as I did in Republicans. KURTZLEBEN: Carolyn Yunker came to Saturday's protests from her home in suburban Maryland. YUNKER: Democrats have used this for 50 years to fundraise. They had opportunities to codify Roe. They chose not to because being the pro-choice candidate in an election helps you raise money. And frankly, I'm pretty disgusted with a lot of our representatives right now. KURTZLEBEN: In the fall, House Democrats did pass a bill that would have made Roe's protections federal law. But it failed in the Senate in May, where it would need 60 votes. Abortion rights supporters want the Senate to blow up the filibuster, but Democrats haven't unified behind that idea, and Biden hasn't pushed for it. He has also resisted calls to expand the court. Immediately after the ruling, Biden gave a statement. But the White House also canceled the daily press briefing, and the president left for a major summit in Europe. Thirty-four senators this weekend urged Biden in a letter to lead a national response. A White House official emphasized that the administration will support medication abortion and cited dozens of discussions with abortion rights stakeholders. The White House also says policy action is coming this week. Nineteen-year-old Pryia Thompson, who came to the Supreme Court with her grandmother, said that as a new voter who supports abortion rights, she's feeling ambivalent about her vote. PRYIA THOMPSON: Honestly, it's like, I'm just getting started, and all of this is happening. So it's, like, hard to, like, make decisions and know who to vote for and who's really for us. KURTZLEBEN: With Roe overturned, Democratic candidates like Sarah Godlewski running for Senate in Wisconsin will be working to show voters that, no, seriously, they will prioritize protecting abortion rights if elected. SARAH GODLEWSKI: This is one of the reasons why I stepped up to run for the U.S. Senate, you know, was that I was getting sick of reproductive freedom being treated like some sort of extra credit project. KURTZLEBEN: While this anger is prominent in the abortion rights movement, there's also an acknowledgement that some supporters grew complacent during the half-century that Roe was in effect. Aimee Allison is founder of She the People, which promotes women candidates of color. AIMEE ALLISON: Even when we heard that the Supreme Court was planning to overturn Roe v. Wade, it didn't sink in for many people that this was actually a threat realized and it was going to have an effect on our lives. KURTZLEBEN: Allison said she's committed to electing Senate candidates who could help eliminate the filibuster. ALLISON: If we can elect these women of color, we'll have the votes in order to pass the legislation that went through the House and is sitting at the Senate to restore abortion rights and make reproductive justice a reality. KURTZLEBEN: In the short and medium term, some are focused on abortion access. Laura Kriv was among a small group protesting in front of Justice Brett Kavanaugh's house on Saturday night. LAURA KRIV: Just like the Janes started this movement years ago and took it upon themselves to make sure women had safe access to abortion, we're going to have to do the same thing. And I'm not going to wait for Biden to do something. KURTZLEBEN: With activists motivated to do so much to protect abortion access right now, it's not clear how much they see voting this November as a solution. Danielle Kurtzleben, NPR News.

RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: Wisconsin is pivotal in determining the majority in the U.S. Senate, just like it's been in recent elections. NPR's H.J. Mai traveled to eastern Wisconsin and talked to a couple of rural voters about what's driving their choices. H J MAI, BYLINE: It's a Sunday afternoon in Sheboygan, Wis. Producer Shelby Hawkins and I are walking around the city's northern neighborhood, looking for people who are willing to talk to us about the upcoming midterm elections. I'm Hans. This is Shelby. SHELBY HAWKINS, BYLINE: Hi. BRAD KARSTEADT: Hi, Shelby. MAI: We realize quickly that on this particular day, many people are much more focused on the Green Bay Packers game than politics. After unsuccessfully knocking on a number of doors, we came across a house on a tree-lined street just blocks from Lake Michigan. In the front yard, between several skeletons and other Halloween decorations, we saw signs for Republican Senator Ron Johnson and gubernatorial candidate Tim Michels. (OSUNDBITE OF KNOCKING ON DOOR) MAI: Opening the door was a middle-aged couple, Linda Fellenz and Brad Karsteadt. They welcomed us inside their home to share their thoughts. LINDA FELLENZ: We are both conservatives, born and raised that way. MAI: Fellenz was wearing a Packers T-shirt. She owns an environmental consulting firm in Milwaukee. She supports Senator Johnson because of his background as a business owner. FELLENZ: I'm fiscally conservative. I don't like overspending. I don't like large government. I would prefer to have the government streamlined quite a bit. I also think there has to be a lot of focus on small businesses and supporting them and recruiting them. MAI: In addition to economic concerns, Fellenz and Karsteadt talked about election integrity and reproductive health. Democrats hope abortion rights will engage their base. And it's an important issue for this conservative couple, too. FELLENZ: We're pro-life. We feel that a lot of abortion is birth control. I'm very much opposed to that. I think it's ridiculous to assume that anyone would be opposed to someone having an abortion that would affect either the life of the mother or the life of the baby. MAI: Wisconsin is a politically divided state. Trump won here in 2016 and Biden in 2020. That means being public about your politics often has repercussions. During the last election, the couple's Trump sign was vandalized. KARSTEADT: But our liberal neighbors helped us put the signs back up. (LAUGHTER) KARSTEADT: So we're - the neighborhood is the neighborhood. We all get along, and we all respect each other. MAI: Fellenz and Karsteadt believe their community's strong enough to bridge those partisan divides, no matter Tuesday's outcome. H.J. Mai, NPR News, Sheboygan County, Wis.

            "article_content": "Abortion became a pivotal issue for Democrats in the midterms. Pro- and anti-abortion rights groups are now analyzing what worked and what didn't as they prepare for the next wave of messaging.  SCOTT SIMON, HOST: Democrats were ready to lose in the midterms earlier this month, especially given President Biden's low approval ratings. Why they didn't do as poorly as expected is still a topic of conversation and debate, especially among activists on both sides of the abortion question. NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben reports. DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN, BYLINE: Ahead of the midterms, pollsters and strategists and, yes, journalists were obsessed with voters' top issues. But then, people rarely vote with a single issue in mind. And that makes it hard to know how much abortion swayed the midterms. But there are a few things we can say. One is that the Roe overturn seems to have immediately motivated women, says Democratic strategist Tom Bonier, CEO of TargetSmart. TOM BONIER: Almost everywhere, what you saw was a pretty significant surge in gender gap in the, you know, two to four weeks after Dobbs. And then we saw an increase, but not, you know, not as pronounced after that. KURTZLEBEN: Bonier and other strategists will be watching for more data to answer which women were fired up, as well as how much abortion motivated men. A second takeaway - pro-choice policies in isolation did well. Five abortion-related ballot measures all came out in favor of abortion rights, even in red states like Kentucky and Montana. And yet, says Democratic strategist Rachel Bitecofer... RACHEL BITECOFER: There are millions of people who voted yes for a referendum to codify Roe or whatever, and then went and voted for pro-life conservative Republican candidates. KURTZLEBEN: Furthermore, plenty of politicians who famously favor restricting abortion easily won - for example, Republican governors Greg Abbott in Texas and Ron DeSantis in Florida. Why is that? Bitecofer thinks it's about ineffective communication by abortion rights supporters. BITECOFER: You want to make sure people understand this man is the guy who's signing into law the bill to steal your rights. KURTZLEBEN: The problem so far has been breaking voters' connections to party identity. BITECOFER: People like heuristics. They like something that can tell them what to do without any mental investment. And that's why the party label is so incredibly powerful. KURTZLEBEN: Still, that's one Democratic take. Marjorie Dannenfelser is president of SBA Pro-Life America. She sees wins by Abbott and DeSantis as proof of their political power. MARJORIE DANNENFELSER: The one thing that you have in an election on the pro-life side, and we've always had, is the candidate, the human representation of the argument on the debate stage. The reason that the governors are winning well who have been ambitious for life is that they've been articulating their position. They have the bully pulpit of the governorships. KURTZLEBEN: One takeaway that's harder to quantify is what kind of messaging works. For Dannenfelser, it's clear that Republicans failed, and the Democrats found a winning strategy. DANNENFELSER: They ended up with a position that we need to label Republicans as for abortion bans generally and do not go into the specifics of what a Republican is for or a pro-life candidate is for. KURTZLEBEN: Multiple Democratic strategists agree that staying away from gestational limits was smart, though they frame it differently. Here's Analilia Mejia, co-director of the progressive Center for Popular Democracy. ANALILIA MEJIA: I think it was not only smart but right of them to say there isn't some line, there isn't some, like, countdown clock in which you go from being a full autonomous human being to property of the state. KURTZLEBEN: That leaves open the question of what the parties see as their best paths going forward. To Republican pollster Whit Ayres, his party needs to abandon the tightest abortion measures. WHIT AYRES: We have a number of laws that have been passed by Republican legislatures that are far from the mainstream, that include no exceptions, for example, for rape or incest. And that's the very definition of outside the mainstream. KURTZLEBEN: The question is what Republicans do with that information. In the midterms, many Republican candidates avoided the topic of abortion. To Dannenfelser, that was a mistake. DANNENFELSER: One thing you cannot do is expect to be a successful primary Republican candidate who says it's a states issue, and I don't expect to ever promote or sign a federal 15-week or heartbeat protection. KURTZLEBEN: Rebecca Katz, senior adviser for John Fetterman's Senate campaign, likewise thinks her party needs to not just message but pass abortion rights legislation. REBECCA KATZ: I don't think that folks should just be high-fiving because we won a cycle with such a devastating impact. Right? Like, there is a lot of work to be done. KURTZLEBEN: Both sides will be plowing ahead, in other words, just with new information about who might support them and how. Danielle Kurtzleben, NPR News.

The issue will be center stage as abortion rights supporter Maggie Hassan tries to hold her seat in the U.S. Senate.  EMILY FENG, HOST: Abortion rights have shot to the top of an important U.S. Senate race in New Hampshire. The Democratic incumbent is hoping for strong turnout from her base now that a leaked draft opinion shows the U.S. Supreme Court is poised to upend Roe v. Wade. WBUR's Anthony Brooks reports. ANTHONY BROOKS, BYLINE: Top Democrats gathered at Planned Parenthood in Concord recently to sound the alarm about the draft opinion, among them Senator Maggie Hassan, who faces a tough reelection fight. Republicans have identified her seat as one of the keys in their effort to retake the Senate. Hassan says protecting abortion rights is now a central issue in her campaign. MAGGIE HASSAN: We cannot let politicians, whether they be in Washington or in Concord, take away a woman's freedom. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) SUSAN DELEMUS: Shame on you. You're killing babies. BROOKS: Passions are running high. Just a few days ago, Republican State Representative Susan DeLemus confronted abortion rights demonstrators outside the state capitol. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DELEMUS: You're a murderer. You're a murderer. You're a murderer. Shame on you. BROOKS: Although New Hampshire's Republican governor, Chris Sununu, says he's pro-choice, the Republican legislature just defeated an effort to codify Roe into state law. And it imposed new restrictions, including banning most abortions after 24 weeks and requiring anyone seeking one to get an ultrasound. Senator Hassan warns that if Roe falls, abortion access could further erode in New Hampshire. HASSAN: I think people couldn't quite believe that it would actually happen. And now that it's here, they are outraged. BROOKS: Across the country, Democrats hope the abortion debate will help them retain control of Congress at a time when President Biden's popularity has sunk and inflation has soared. Senator Hassan's Republican opponents favor tougher limits on abortions. One of them is Kevin Smith, who used to lead a Christian advocacy group. Smith is avowedly anti-abortion and supports the leaked draft decision. KEVIN SMITH: And so I am comfortable with the issue being returned to the states and with there being reasonable restrictions put in place. BROOKS: Smith says Democrats like Maggie Hassan are raising the alarm about abortion to distract voters from the real issue. K SMITH: Which is the economy, whether it's the prices at the pump, inflation everywhere you go, 401k's. Stocks are tanking. BROOKS: But Senator Hassan insists that access to abortion is also a key concern. She points out that Republican Senate Leader Mitch McConnell wouldn't rule out pursuing a nationwide abortion ban. HASSAN: Elections matter. Granite staters know it. And I think this is an issue that they will vote on. BROOKS: Opponents of abortion say the prospect of overturning Roe v. Wade is energizing them as well. Jason Hennessey, president of New Hampshire Right to Life, welcomes the draft opinion and the attention it's brought to the abortion debate. JASON HENNESSEY: I guess it gives us a much better opportunity to get our message out. We're happy about that, and we hope more people will see the unborn as people who deserve some sort of rights. BROOKS: Polling suggests that New Hampshire voters care more about economic issues than hot-button social issues such as abortion. That's according to Andy Smith, who directs the University of New Hampshire Survey Center. Smith also says a solid majority of New Hampshire voters want to keep abortion legal. But he says it's just too soon to know who the issue will help the most. ANDY SMITH: My view is it probably motivates Democrats more than Republicans simply because anger is a greater motivating force than cheering your party on. BROOKS: What is certain is that voters will be hearing a lot about abortion as the nation braces for a likely post-Roe world. For NPR News, I'm Anthony Brooks.

            "article_content": "Arizona courts reinstated a Civil War era ban on nearly all abortions. Now there is a bipartisan call for a special legislative session as providers and patients are confused and anxious.  MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: Abortion is illegal in Arizona, but what that means exactly is still under contention more than 100 days after the Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade. Arizona prosecutors say they are confused over which of two laws applies. Here to explain is Katherine Davis-Young, who's following this closely at member station KJZZ in Phoenix. Hey there. KATHERINE DAVIS-YOUNG, BYLINE: Hello. KELLY: All right. So the backdrop here - Arizona lawmakers had passed a law before the Supreme Court struck down Roe saying if the court did overturn Roe, there would be a ban on abortion in Arizona after 15 weeks. So they were trying to get out ahead of this. What happened? DAVIS-YOUNG: Right. There's this 15-week law. But Arizona also has an older, even more restrictive abortion ban that dates back to the Civil War era. And that's never been repealed. It makes exceptions only to save the life of the mother, and it makes performing an abortion punishable by two to five years in prison. So when Roe v. Wade was overturned, Republican Attorney General Mark Brnovich said he thought the near total ban should go back into effect. KELLY: He thought it should go into effect. But did he need state courts to weigh in? DAVIS-YOUNG: Right. So I should point out that at the time, Brnovich was also trying to win the Republican Party nomination for Senate, which he ultimately did not. But he had asked the court to reconsider this 1970s decision that had blocked enforcement of this Civil War-era abortion ban. And a couple of weeks ago, a judge granted Brnovich's request. KELLY: OK. So that would seem to suggest that this even stricter ban on abortion, this law that's more than a century old, that is what is now in effect in Arizona. DAVIS-YOUNG: Well, now both of these laws are technically in effect, and the judge declined to weigh in on how the two should interact with each other. So there's still this major confusion. Planned Parenthood is appealing the ruling. And the county attorney for the Phoenix area, Rachel Mitchell, has even released a statement saying if any abortion-related cases come before her office, she'll have to ask the courts for guidance. RACHEL MITCHELL: Friday's Pima County Superior Court decision regarding abortion and the subsequent appeal have not resolved which law among conflicting statutes now applies. KELLY: It sounds so confusing. What is the attorney general who pushed for the old law, Brnovich, what's he saying now? DAVIS-YOUNG: So now, even he is saying this is all too unclear. He's asked our governor to call a special legislative session, but there's no indication if that might happen. Arizona's regular session starts in January. And if there's not a special session, what lawmakers do will depend on the November election. Polling suggests this abortion ban is hugely unpopular, so it's become a huge issue up and down the ballot now in Arizona. KELLY: So bottom line, if prosecutors are not sure which law they are supposed to be following, are any abortions being performed in Arizona? DAVIS-YOUNG: No. The law may be unclear, but the impact is very clear. Abortions have pretty much entirely stopped in our state since this judge's ruling. Dr. Gabrielle Goodrick says her clinic in Phoenix has had to cancel dozens of appointments just in the last couple weeks. She's really frustrated and describes the situation as inhumane. GABRIELLE GOODRICK: It's an awful feeling. Patients are upset. They're confused, angry and scared about what they're going to do. And this isn't changing their minds. They're just going to seek care outside of the state or with self-managed abortion. KELLY: Reporting there from Katherine Davis-Young of member station KJZZ in Phoenix. Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.

Right, Del. Dan Cox, Maryland Republican candidate for governor, talks to reporters in Annapolis, Md., on June 30. Wes Moore, a first-time candidate, has emerged from a nine-way race as the winner of the Maryland Democratic primary for governor, according to a race call by The Associated Press. In November, Moore will face Republican Dan Cox, who won his race Tuesday night according to The Associated Press. Cox is a first-term state lawmaker in the Maryland House of Delegates who helped to spread former President Donald Trump's lies that he won the 2020 election. Trump endorsed Cox in the race. Moore, 43, is an author who has worked in the private and non-profit sectors. He was most recently the CEO of the Robin Hood Foundation, a national anti-poverty organization. He was backed in the race by Oprah Winfrey, who held an online fundraiser for him. If Moore wins, he'll be the first Black governor in the state. Even though registered Democrats outnumber registered Republicans in the state, Democratic voters have thrown support behind a Republican candidate for governor in the last two elections, Gov. Larry Hogan. The strong desire on the part of Democrats to take back the office led to the crowded primary. But it might not be that easy for Cox will have a difficult time winning in November. According to a recent poll from Goucher College and member station WYPR, 84% of Democrats would not consider supporting Cox in the general election. Because registered Democrats outnumber registered Republicans 2-to-1 in the state, the Republican would need backing from many Democratic voters to win. State Del.

Dan Cox declares victory in the Maryland Republican primary for governor on July 19 in Emmitsburg, Md. The Democratic Governors Association spent more than $1 million running ads touting Cox's record supporting Trump, abortion restrictions and gun rights. It's a strategy we've seen in other states this year. State Republican leaders say the ads were designed to help Cox win Tuesday's primary, giving Democrats a leg up in November, but the DGA says they're designed to be attack ads and that they're starting the general election fight early. Democrats haven't been able to elect a governor in Maryland since 2010 with former Gov. Martin O'Malley, and Hogan has been enormously popular in the state. He's an outspoken opponent of former Trump, is bullish when it comes to cutting taxes but is moderate on most social issues. Another poll from Goucher College last October found that when voters were asked to choose between a Republican like either Trump or Hogan and a progressive or moderate Democrat, \"a Republican like Hogan is competitive, or even bests a moderate or progressive Democrat,\" says Mileah Kromer, the director of the Sarah T. Hughes Center for Politics at Goucher College. \"And a Republican like Trump, on the other hand, gets blown out of the water.\"",

AILSA CHANG, HOST: Gas prices are again at an all-time high today. And later this week, we could get more bad news about inflation. Today at the White House, President Biden had a message for the American people. He says he feels their pain when it comes to rising prices. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: I want every American to know that I'm taking inflation very seriously, and it's my top domestic priority. CHANG: But the president wasn't just focused on tackling inflation, he was also pushing his latest strategy to take on Republicans. For more on that, NPR's Tamara Keith joins us now from the White House. Hi, Tam. TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Hi, Ailsa. CHANG: All right. So before we get to strategy against Republicans, let's start with inflation. At this point, how is Biden explaining why inflation keeps persisting? KEITH: Well, as we heard, he started by saying that he knows people are hurting, that wages are rising, but they aren't keeping up. And he also said that these are unusual times, that inflation is being driven by a once-in-a-century pandemic and the supply chain issues it caused and Russia's war with Ukraine. He has previously described Putin's price hike as affecting oil prices. Well, now he's talking about Putin's price hike on food supplies and prices as well. Biden talked about how the Fed is working on containing prices by raising interest rates. And he talked about how Democrats have a plan aimed at lowering costs on things that affect people, like prescription drug prices. And then he quickly made a turn to draw a contrast with Republicans, arguing that while they want to criticize the president for inflation, they don't themselves have a good plan to bring it down. Celinda Lake is a Democratic pollster working with candidates who will be on the ballot in November. I talked to her about this. She says contrast is really important because right now the majority of voters believe Republicans are better on the economy than Democrats. CELINDA LAKE: There are two kinds of elections. There are elections that are about referendums on the incumbent, and there are elections that are about a choice. We need to make this election about a choice. KEITH: Biden and Democrats are not going to be able to fix inflation by November. And in fact, people are forming their views on the economy right now as they fill up their cars with gas. And there really isn't that much the president can do in the short term about inflation, so Biden is trying to change the dynamic here. CHANG: Right. OK. So how is the president trying to pull that off? KEITH: Well, instead of people voting on how they feel about the economy, he wants them to think about how they feel about Republicans. But let's just say that every president wants their midterms to be a choice election and not a referendum, and that's a really hard thing to pull off. He has started using this new term, ultra-MAGA Republicans, and it's sort of a catchall to highlight the most extreme elements, as he would say, of the Republican Party - everything from election denial to proposals to outlaw abortion or changes to Medicare and Social Security. And Biden said that he knows Democratic voters are frustrated that his party hasn't been able to accomplish everything they promised - or even a lot of their major goals - but he argued that the alternative is worse. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BIDEN: Congressional Republicans - not all of them - but the MAGA Republicans are counting on you to be as frustrated by the pace of progress, which they have everything - they've done everything they can to slow down - that you're going to - will hand power over to them and enact - so they can enact their extreme agenda. CHANG: OK. So instead of talking about what Democrats have not been able to get done, Biden's trying to pivot here and focus on MAGA Republicans potentially taking over Congress. KEITH: Ultra-MAGA - and MAGA is short for Make America Great Again. That is the slogan that propelled former President Trump into office in 2016. Now, Biden isn't saying the name Trump, but Trump is already out with an ultra-MAGA T-shirt that they're selling with a cartoon version of him flying around as a Superman-type character. Celinda Lake, the pollster I talked to earlier, told me that the idea behind this slogan is to say not all republicans are bad, just the extreme ones. And in a sense, that is an effort to appeal to independent voters who Biden is struggling with right now. White House officials say that we will be hearing a lot more of this, but it isn't entirely clear whether this slogan is going to stick or whether it will work to persuade voters. CHANG: That is NPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith. Thank you, Tam. KEITH: You're welcome. Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "A Cajun radio station in South Louisiana has been broadcasting for 69 years. It's preserving the culture and the tradition of broadcasting live music from a bar every Saturday morning.  SCOTT SIMON, HOST: There's a little radio station in south Louisiana. It's been on the air for nearly 70 years, doing everything it can to keep alive a dying language. That's Cajun French. On Saturday mornings, it broadcasts live French music from inside a venerable bar - sadly, no songs from the music of B.J. Leiderman, who writes our theme music. During the week, the radio station opens the phone lines for native French speakers to swap stories and reminisce. NPR's John Burnett has the story. JOHN BURNETT, BYLINE: It's Saturday morning at Fred's Lounge in the town of Mamou, which sits among the rice fields and crawfish ponds of what's called the Cajun prairie. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) BURNETT: Inside the red brick tavern by 8:30 a.m., they're already serving Budweisers and bloody marys as couples waltz on the worn linoleum. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) BURNETT: A sign reads, please do not stand on the tables, chairs or cigarette machine. Nearby sits a radio announcer named Mike Perron. He anchors the live weekly broadcasts from Fred's Lounge on The Legend - 1050 KVPI. MIKE PERRON: (Speaking French). All right? All right, guys, back to the bandstand. (SOUNDBITE OF ACCORDIAN PLAYING) BURNETT: Perron is a city councilman, retired auto body repairman and part-time DJ. PERRON: Today, we are at Fred's Lounge on Sixth Street in Big Mamou. I start at 9 o'clock, and then I finish it by 11 o'clock. I do my sponsors mostly in English, but I do some in French. But the people over here - a lot of them don't understand all the French words, so I do it in English, too. We call that a Franglais - little bit of French, little bit of English. That's how we call that over here. BURNETT: The live radio feed from Fred's began in the 1960s with a local educator named Revon Reed. Now his son Seth Reed comes here almost every Saturday morning. SETH REED: We dance. We drink. We have a good time. And this is the only bar that's still old-fashioned, old-school. Nothing has changed since it was built. That's what I love about it. They still have the same urinal from back in the '40s and - that's in the bathroom. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) BURNETT: The Acadians or Cajuns descended from Roman Catholic French Canadians who were expelled from the Nova Scotia region by the British in the mid-1700s. They made their way to the bayou country of south Louisiana, and here they thrived, preserving their culture and folkways. But a number of factors worked against the language. Cajuns were punished for speaking French in school. Cajun GIs left the region to fight in the world wars and learned English. The discovery of oil ushered in more English influences, and television further diluted the language. Radio is part of a broad movement to save Cajun French from extinction. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) BURNETT: Eight radio stations in southern Louisiana still broadcast partially in French. KVPI, located in Ville Platte, does more than any other - news, weather, talk, a swap shop, even obits in French. This year, the station won a uniquely Louisiana award. (SOUNDBITE OF RADIO SHOW, \"LA TASSE DE CAFE\") CHARLIE MANUEL: All right. (Speaking French). BURNETT: While the Saturday morning Cajun music at Fred's Lounge is internationally renowned, the station's most popular program is a daily call-in show. (SOUNDBITE OF RADIO SHOW, \"LA TASSE DE CAFE\") MANUEL: (Speaking French). BURNETT: It's called \"The Cup of Coffee\" - \"La Tasse\" to regulars. Here in deeply conservative Trump country, the callers don't talk about abortion or election fraud or the perfidious Democrats. No, they're talking about where to find the sweetest watermelons, what food to bring to the cemetery on All Souls' Day, how to kill maggots under the house and the best squirrel hunting. (SOUNDBITE OF RADIO SHOW, \"LA TASSE DE CAFE\") MARK LAYNE: (Speaking French). MANUEL: (Speaking French). And Happy Squirrel Weekend (speaking French). BURNETT: The station's general manager is Mark Layne, born Martel Ardoin. KVPI signed on the air in 1953. Layne started here when he was in high school, and he's been at the station for 51 years. LAYNE: We really promote the French language and our French culture. And I want to emphasize Cajun French. There is a bit of difference. Yeah. We have our own little lingo and our own dialect down here, and we're proud of it. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"MY TOOT TOOT\") ROCKIN' SIDNEY: (Singing) Don't mess with my toot toot. Don't mess with my toot toot. Now, you can have the other woman. But don't mess with my toot too. BURNETT: Floyd Soileau, record producer, book publisher and Cajun personality, is giving a tour of his record store and museum in Ville Platte. FLOYD SOILEAU: This guy here gave me my biggest worldwide hit - Rockin Sidney, \"Don't Mess With My Toot Toot.\" Yeah - biggie, biggie. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"MY TOOT TOOT\") ROCKIN' SIDNEY: (Singing) You're gonna have yourself a case. I'm gonna break your face. Now, don't mess with my toot toot. BURNETT: Actually, it was Soileau who had the idea for \"La Tasse\" back in the '60s. He regularly calls in to tell old yarns in French. But now he's in the minority. Most scholars speak English. In fact, most of the French speakers you hear on KVPI, like him, are old. SOILEAU: Sadly, a lot of our Cajun French listeners have passed on. And some of the young people are trying to pick up on it. But it's not coming fast enough. It's going to be a thing of the past, unfortunately, I guess. As my age group goes on, I'm afraid it's going to be tough to keep it going. BURNETT: The Cajun patois in Louisiana continues its steep decline. The American Community Survey on language estimated the number of French speakers at about 77,000 in 2020. That's down from 136,000 in just a decade. Barry Jean Ancelet is a renowned folklorist and professor emeritus at the University of Louisiana, Lafayette. While he acknowledges that native French speakers are passing away one by one, he's heartened that young musicians, for instance, are composing songs in French and Cajun culture overall remains robust. BARRY JEAN ANCELET: Are you going to tell Danny Benoit, who makes the best gumbo in the world, loves to hunt and fish, goes out dancing to Cajun music and zydeco and, you know, has a big family, all the other stuff, and he doesn't speak French no more - are you going to go tell him he's not Cajun? I wouldn't do it. And if you do it, I would duck 'cause he still feels profoundly Cajun. BURNETT: In other words, language is only one measure of a culture. If you visit south Louisiana, it still feels profoundly Cajun, especially if you tune your amp dial to KVPI 1050.

            "article_content": "Michigan doctors say when Roe is overturned a \"dormant\" state law could outlaw abortion even for rape or incest. The Democratic state AG warns local prosecutors may charge both doctors and patients.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: Some people in Michigan are sounding the alarm about a strict abortion law that's been on the books since 1931. It's currently unenforced, but if the Supreme Court strikes Roe down, that could change. As Michigan Radio's Kate Wells reports, the law would make abortion a felony even in cases of rape or incest. KATE WELLS, BYLINE: The anti-abortion protesters who often crowd outside this Planned Parenthood in Ann Arbor have gone home for the day, so now it's quiet - just a lot of women sitting in their cars, one with a baby on her lap, all waiting for friends or family in the clinic. Veronica Valdivia-Vera says she did not know about Michigan's old law criminalizing abortion. VERONICA VALDIVIA-VERA: Nope. I was not aware that, you know, that would happen. It's, like, shocking times. We didn't even think that, in 2022, we'd be worrying about women's rights, reproductive rights. WELLS: Veronica is here with her daughter-in-law, Stephanie Mejia-Arciniega. They're waiting for Stephanie's friend, who's still inside the clinic. And Stephanie says even just pulling into the clinic was kind of scary. They were surrounded by anti-abortion protesters. STEPHANIE MEJIA-ARCINIEGA: It's kind of intimidating because they come to your car super-fast. You don't want to run them feet over. So, like, we had to, like, stop and be like, OK, no, thank you. And we were, like, 10 minutes late for our appointment because of that. WELLS: Stephanie is only 18. She can't imagine a world where abortion's illegal. MEJIA-ARCINIEGA: You wouldn't want someone young that isn't ready to have to have a baby because the law says no. Like, it's not fair. WELLS: Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel agrees. DANA NESSEL: People can go to jail or prison for this. WELLS: Nessel says the way the old law is written, the doctor who performs an abortion and possibly the patient could get up to four years. Michigan has not enforced that law since Roe was decided in 1973, but it was never repealed. Nessel, a Democrat, says she won't enforce it. But Michigan has 83 local county prosecutors, and they could do whatever they want. NESSEL: I don't think that I have the authority to tell the duly elected county prosecutors what they can and what they cannot charge. WELLS: Nessel also talked about her own abortion that she had years ago. She was pregnant with triplets, and they weren't growing in utero. NESSEL: And I was told very, very specifically that there was no way that all three would make it to term. But if I aborted one, then it was possible that the other two might live. And I took my doctor's advice. And you know what? It turned out that he was right. You know, now I have two beautiful sons. WELLS: But under the 1931 law, there is just one exemption - to preserve the life of the woman. University of Michigan OB-GYN Dr. Lisa Harris says that is dangerously vague. What if a pregnant woman has severe heart disease and her chance of dying in pregnancy is 20 to 30%? LISA HARRIS: But is that enough of a chance of dying that that person would qualify under Michigan's ban? Or would their risk of dying need to be 50% or 100%? Or what if a pregnant woman has cancer and she needs to end the pregnancy to start chemo? WELLS: Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer is a Democrat, but the state's legislature is controlled by Republicans, so weeks ago Whitmer filed a lawsuit trying to block the old abortion law from ever taking effect. There's also a push to let voters decide in the November election if abortion should be legal in Michigan. But that would not be until long after the Supreme Court makes its final ruling.

            "article_content": "It's primary day in Georgia. In Tokyo, President Biden meets the leaders of Australia, India and Japan \u2014 a group known as the Quad. And, Russia's invasion of Ukraine began three months ago.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: We're finding out a lot this month about how much Donald Trump still dominates the Republican Party. LEILA FADEL, HOST: A series of Republican primaries show the power of Trump's endorsement. It also shows how many voters want to embrace Trump's lies about the 2020 election. Today's primary in Georgia is especially revealing. The sitting governor supported Trump but affirmed the reality that the former president lost in 2020. His main challenger makes a bid for office by denying the facts. INSKEEP: Politics reporter Sam Gringlas of WABE in Atlanta is covering this story. Sam, good morning. SAM GRINGLAS, BYLINE: Hi, Steve. INSKEEP: OK. Brian Kemp, the governor, versus David Perdue, a one-time senator. How did this become a test of Trump's power? GRINGLAS: All right. Well, the first thing you need to know is that Perdue is running with Trump's support, and it was Trump who urged Perdue to take on Kemp in the first place. Now, it wasn't always this way. Trump actually endorsed Kemp in 2018. But then the 2020 election happened, and Trump says Kemp didn't help him overturn the election results in Georgia, and so Trump has spent the last year or so just bashing Kemp at every turn. And Perdue has basically premised his whole campaign on this false claim that the 2020 election was stolen. I mean, just listen to literally his first words at a debate last month. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DAVID PERDUE: First off, folks, let me be very clear tonight - the election in 2020 was rigged and stolen. GRINGLAS: And Trump has endorsed primary candidates up and down the ballot who are peddling these same claims. INSKEEP: How much of an effect is Trump having in Georgia? GRINGLAS: Well, we're starting to see a few hints. Kemp has been leading Perdue in the polls. Perdue's fundraising and spending have dried up. And the reality is that Kemp is an incumbent governor who is popular with conservatives. He's been leaning into that record and is kind of looking beyond Perdue and 2020 to a rematch with Democrat Stacey Abrams this fall. There's also this line that Kemp uses at a lot of campaign events. He repeated it again at a rally last night with former Vice President Mike Pence. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BRIAN KEMP: This family has been getting up every single day to make sure that Stacey Abrams is not going to be our governor or the next president. (CHEERING) GRINGLAS: You know, I've met voters who still like Trump and who believe the election was stolen in 2020, but they just don't blame Kemp for that, and so they aren't swayed by Trump's endorsement. Then I've also met people who voted for Trump but say they are very ready to move on. They worry that relitigating the 2020 election is just holding the party back. So this primary is not only a test of whether Trump is still the most important player in the GOP, but also whether his false claims about election fraud will outlast his own political clout. INSKEEP: Sam, it's really interesting that you mention Mike Pence, the former vice president, there to campaign for Brian Kemp, the guy that Trump hates, because Pence has his own presidential ambitions, so you see him positioning himself there to maybe get a little bit of credit if Kemp goes ahead and wins. Will you talk a little bit about the context? Why is Georgia such an important state? GRINGLAS: Well, Georgia is on the cusp of huge political and demographic change. Remember, Georgia voted for Joe Biden in 2020 after just decades of GOP dominance here. And all of this comes at a time when who controls the governor's mansion is really important, as we think about election integrity, abortion, the pandemic. Plus, you've got Democratic Senator Raphael Warnock, who is up for reelection, and that means Georgia could once again decide who controls the U.S. Senate. INSKEEP: Sam Gringlas of WABE. Thanks so much. GRINGLAS: Thanks, Steve. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) INSKEEP: Leaders of four nations with a common interest in containing China are pushing to work together. FADEL: They are the U.S., Australia, India and Japan, a group known as the Quad. Their latest meeting focused not only on China but on its strategic partner, Russia. Here's President Biden speaking today at the Quad meeting. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: We're navigating a dark hour in our shared history. The Russian brutal and unprovoked war against Ukraine has triggered a humanitarian catastrophe, and innocent civilians have - killed in the streets, and millions of refugees are internally displaced as well as exiled. And this is more than just a European issue; this is a global issue. INSKEEP: Which is why Biden was discussing it with leaders in Asia. Let's talk this through with NPR's John Ruwitch. He is in Shenzhen in Southern China. And, of course, China must watch these meetings very closely. Hey there, John. JOHN RUWITCH, BYLINE: Good morning, Steve. INSKEEP: I guess we could say the Quad, to some extent, is all about China. Is that fair? RUWITCH: (Laughter) To some extent, it is. You know, the formal name is the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue. It was established in 2004 after the earthquake and tsunami in Southeast Asia as a way to get aid there in a coordinated way, formalized three years later. It kind of dropped off the map after that, and then President Trump resurrected it. And since then, it's really picked up steam under Biden. The group's not a formal alliance, but it's becoming more prominent. It's met four times since he became president. And yeah, the big driver is growing concern about China. And it jibes quite well with Biden's foreign policy focus on China as a threat and competitor and his effort to rally friends and allies to the cause. INSKEEP: And of course, if you add the allies to the United States, its economic power would be overwhelming compared even with China's. But how did concern about China express itself at this meeting? RUWITCH: Well, it was a bit indirect. I mean, the Russian invasion of Ukraine was flagged at this meeting by Trump and others as a cautionary tale for Asia, really. You know, as we heard Biden say at the top, it's more than a European issue; it's a global issue. And Japan's prime minister went further, and he said, you know, we cannot let the same thing, like an invasion of Ukraine, happen in the Indo-Pacific. He didn't name names, but, you know, many see parallels between Ukraine and Taiwan, right? Taiwan is a self-governing democracy, but Beijing considers it part of China and has really ramped up rhetoric and military exercises around the island. It wants to bring Taiwan back into the fold peacefully but hasn't renounced the use of force to do so if it needs to. So there's this thread hanging out there. INSKEEP: Can you just clean up some remarks for us here or at least explain some remarks? President Biden said yes yesterday when asked if he would get involved militarily in the event of a Chinese attack on Taiwan. That is a lot less ambiguous than the U.S. normally is. But has the U.S. changed its policy? RUWITCH: Well, Biden, again - you know, today - he said this yesterday and again today - he said, no, the policy on Taiwan has not changed, you know, including strategic ambiguity, which is a part of the approach to the way they've dealt with this question of whether or not they would defend Taiwan. As far as Beijing's concerned, the mixed messages are kind of moot. I asked Alexander Huang about this. He's a security expert who teaches at Tamkang University outside of Taipei. ALEXANDER HUANG: In any future Taiwan scenario, we are assured from Beijing's eyes that the United States will get itself involved. So I would bet that in all military drills and military exercises, the U.S. intervention is in their playbook. RUWITCH: You know, the reality is that Washington has been deepening its ties with partners across the Asia Pacific, like the Quad nations and like Taiwan, and ties with Beijing at the same time have just gotten frostier and frostier. INSKEEP: NPR's John Ruwitch. Thanks. RUWITCH: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) INSKEEP: Russia invaded Ukraine three months ago today. FADEL: And what had been anticipated as a swift Russian victory has turned into a drawn-out fight. More than 6.5 million people have fled the country. Cities have turned to rubble in the wake of the biggest attack in Europe since World War II. And yet there's no end in sight. INSKEEP: NPR's Greg Myre is reporting from Ukraine's capital, Kyiv. Hey there, Greg. GREG MYRE, BYLINE: Hi, Steve. INSKEEP: How would you summarize 90 days of war? MYRE: Russia has underachieved; Ukraine has overachieved. This is true on almost every front. But right now neither side appears capable of a major breakthrough, a knockout blow, and there are growing signs this could become a long, drawn-out stalemate. For some perspective, I called retired U.S. Lieutenant General Ben Hodges. He led the U.S. Army in Europe, which helped train Ukrainian troops after Russia's 2014 invasion. He also visited Ukraine just days before Russia invaded back in February. He was actually a bit surprised by how casual the Ukrainians were, but he said it seemed to reflect their confidence they had in their military now. Here's how he sees it today. BEN HODGES: War is a test of will, and it's a test of logistics. Clearly, the Ukrainians have the stronger will. The logistical situation for them gets a little bit better every day while for the Russians, it gets a little bit worse every day. INSKEEP: What is Ukraine's most important achievement so far? MYRE: Ukraine forced Russian President Vladimir Putin to abandon, at least for now, his main objective, which was to oust President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and effectively take over the country. Remember, Russian troops reached the outskirts of Ukraine's two largest cities in the early days of the war, Kyiv, the capital, and Kharkiv in the northeast. In both cases, the Ukrainians stopped the Russians in their tracks and forced them to retreat. Here in Kyiv, Steve, the war is still present. There are soldiers in the streets. Government buildings are sandbagged. The air raid sirens go off daily. But people are going about their life. We see families in the park. Young people are buzzing around on scooters. Kids are hanging out at the mall. The city is returning to normal, and there's no sense of imminent danger. INSKEEP: Although let's talk about the flipside of this, Greg. It's true that the Russians have been forced to retreat from around Kyiv, and they've done nothing like what their initial objectives seemed to be, and yet if you're Vladimir Putin, you might look at this situation, if you don't particularly care about all the casualties and loss of equipment, and realize that you have more territory under Russian army control than you did at the beginning. Russia has advanced in some places and not retreated. How significant are those advances? MYRE: It's significant. Those two southern cities they've captured - Mariupol and Kherson - advances they're making in the east. President Zelenskyy says 50 to 100 Ukrainian troops are being killed daily. Russia now has this unbroken swath of Ukrainian territory from Donbas in the east to Crimea in the south. Ukraine would need a major offensive to dislodge the Russians. INSKEEP: One other bit of news - a Russian diplomat resigned yesterday. Why? MYRE: Yeah, he's Boris Bondarev. He worked for the Russian diplomatic mission in Geneva. He called the war, quote, \"a crime against the Ukrainian people and the people of Russia.\" He's not that high ranking but the most senior Russian official to quit and publicly denounce the war. INSKEEP: Greg, thanks for your reporting. Always appreciate it. MYRE: My pleasure. INSKEEP: NPR's Greg Myre is in Kyiv. Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "NPR's Ailsa Chang talks with Dave Helling of The Kansas City Star about the historical background of Tuesday night's vote on abortion rights in the state.  AILSA CHANG, HOST: The voters of Kansas have spoken, with nearly 59% of them voting to keep abortion legal in the state. Now, this issue was on yesterday's ballot and closely watched throughout the country, in part because Kansas is the first state to vote on abortion since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade earlier this summer. For a sense of how a state as conservative as Kansas ended up with this result, we're turning now to Dave Helling, editorial writer and columnist for The Kansas City Star. Welcome. DAVE HELLING: Great to be with you, Ailsa. CHANG: Well, it's great to have you. So I want to first start with the results. What have you been hearing about why voters wanted to keep abortion legal in your state? HELLING: Talking to people who voted no, which was the pro-choice side, there was a common theme of trying to keep the government out of this extraordinarily important decision first. And second, there was real fear after the Supreme Court discarded Roe v. Wade that states like Kansas would indeed impose very strict restrictions on the abortion procedure. And that was something they simply weren't interested in. CHANG: And we should be clear about the geography of the vote here because, I mean, I guess you would assume this referendum would have been mostly won in the democratic areas of the state. But even in counties where Trump won, the referendum lost. Why do you think that is? HELLING: Well, first, let's be clear. There aren't many Democratic areas in Kansas, period. It's a very Republican state, a couple of pockets of urban votes. But by and large, for most of its recent history, it's been very Republican - hasn't elected a Democratic senator in almost a hundred years. And so it was a surprise in some ways that some of the more rural counties where we expected a 70-30 vote for yes turned out to be closer to maybe 60-40 or 55-45, which reflects the fact that a lot of Republicans, maybe 80- or 90,000 votes, decided to endorse the no position and guarantee abortion rights in Kansas. That is a surprise. And there's a message there for the Republican Party that even some of its own members are more friendly to abortion rights maybe than most people believe. CHANG: Well, your editorial board, which you're a member on, it was pretty clear in its writing, and that is, quote, \"in a stunning display of common sense, Kansas voters Tuesday overwhelmingly rejected a constitutional amendment that would have put abortion policy completely in the hands of the legislature and the governor.\" And then it goes on to say that those who voted no chose to, quote, \"trust women.\" But given the Republican-led legislature, this issue is not going to be over in Kansas anytime soon. So what do you think comes next? HELLING: Indeed, the legislature is likely to come back in January and try again, in part because the Supreme Court in 2019 did not say that abortion could be unregulated in Kansas, the state Supreme Court. Instead, it said that you have to meet the highest level of scrutiny. But if you can meet that level, you can still have restrictions. And I think the Republicans in the legislature will try to test that theory. And then we're just in for battles in the courts. CHANG: Before I let you go, I know that you have covered politics in Kansas for - what? - something like more than 40 years? HELLING: A long time. CHANG: A long time. HELLING: (Laughter). CHANG: So last night's results on this ballot issue, I mean, in the long view that you have, how striking is this moment to you? HELLING: Well, not so much. You know, one of the first politicians I ever covered from Kansas was Nancy Kassebaum, who was a senator for three terms. She was a Republican. She was pro-choice. There was a time Kansas, in the '80s and early '90s, when abortion politics were much more complicated, that a Republican could be pro-choice and still win election. And so in the contemporary environment, it is surprising. Over the long sweep of Kansas history, it's perhaps not as surprising. There has been and continues to be a little bit of a libertarian streak, which we saw 30 or 40 years ago and seemed to rear its head again in 2022. CHANG: A libertarian streak saying, government, don't make my decisions for me. HELLING: Correct. And in this election, the no vote supporters did a pretty good job of framing the vote exactly that way, that this is a vote about freedom and equality and women's rights and not so much about abortion itself. And I think they succeeded in making that argument, and we saw the results. CHANG: Dave Helling of The Kansas City Star, thank you so much for joining us. HELLING: Great to be with you.

            "article_content": "The Texas gubernatorial race is tightening, despite polls earlier this year that indicated an overwhelming lead by Republican Gov. Greg Abbott over former Rep. Beto O'Rourke.  A MARTINEZ, HOST: In Texas, an abortion ban and the school shooting in Uvalde may have shifted the odds in the governor's race. Earlier this year, polls indicated that Republican Governor Greg Abbott had an overwhelming lead over the Democrat in the race, former Congressman Beto O'Rourke. But as NPR's Wade Goodwyn reports, the Democrat's chances may have improved. WADE GOODWYN, BYLINE: It's 103 in Dallas as Linda Ortman steps out her front door. (SOUNDBITE OF DOG BARKING) LINDA ORTMAN: The dog wants to come? GOODWYN: What used to be considered one of the most right-wing cities in the country has evolved into one that is deeply democratic. The political signs in Ortman's yard are no shock these days. ORTMAN: We have Beto for Texas and Black Lives Matter, Funky East Dallas Democrats and two Mothers Against Greg Abbott signs. GOODWYN: Mothers Against Greg Abbott - MAGA - get it? The signs were invented by an Austin mother. One of her children has a compromised immune system. And in March of last year, when Governor Greg Abbott eliminated the state's COVID mask requirements, Nancy Thompson got very angry. She went into her garage and got a piece of poster board. She was going to drive over to the Capitol building and protest, but she needed to figure out what to write. NANCY THOMPSON: And I was like, gosh, I'm so mad at Greg Abbott. I'm like a Mothers Against Drunk Driving. I'm like, mothers demand action, but I'm a mother against Greg Abbott. So I wrote down, Mothers Against Greg Abbott. GOODWYN: Thompson looked at it and laughed - Mothers Against Greg Abbott - MAGA. THOMPSON: And so I just went down there, and I protested all by myself in front of the Capitol for 2 1/2 hours. I had somebody take my photograph, and I made it public, and it went viral. GOODWYN: Now, Mothers Against Greg Abbott signs can be found in yards across the state. And with three months to go, the governor's contest has tightened. Abbott started the year up 17 points, but SMU political science professor Cal Jillson believes now the race is on. CAL JILLSON: It's six or seven - maybe eight points. But Abbott is not sweating unduly at this point, but he is alert to danger on the horizon. So I think we've got a race for governor in Texas. GOODWYN: Jillson believes there are several reasons why O'Rourke has a chance. First, the statewide collapse of the electricity grid in February of 2021 - hundreds died, and millions froze for days. Then, on the last day of their school year, 19 elementary students and two teachers were gunned down in Uvalde, Texas, by a teenager using an AR-15-style rifle. Finally, there's been the near-total ban on abortion that Abbott signed into law last year. In fact, Nancy Thompson's group decided to make a video about it. (SOUNDBITE OF POLITICAL AD) UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #1: (As Dr. Robinson) There's no easy way to say this, but your baby has a catastrophic brain abnormality. GOODWYN: The ad starts with the doctor giving his pregnant patient devastating news. On the wall behind the doctor is a small box with a smiling picture of Texas Governor Greg Abbott on the front. (SOUNDBITE OF POLITICAL AD) UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #1: (As Dr. Robinson) I wish I could tell you what to do, but there is only one person who can make this choice. UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #2: (As character) How much time do I have? UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #1: (As Dr. Robinson) And that person is Greg. UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #2: (As character) Greg? UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #1: (As Dr. Robinson) Yeah. Let me just give him a call. (SOUNDBITE OF CABINET OPENING) UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #1: (As Dr. Robinson) Hey, Greg. GOODWYN: Here's Democratic governor candidate Beto O'Rourke. BETO O'ROURKE: There is now, because of Greg Abbott, a total ban on abortion, with no exception for rape or incest. We are counting first-time voters by the dozen at our events throughout this state - young women overwhelmingly, in fact, who say, you know what? I was never political before. GOODWYN: But unlike the Kansas primary election, the abortion issue is not on Texas' ballot in November. Without that, will Democratic voters turn out in big numbers? Greg Abbott's campaign doesn't appear worried about beating Beto O'Rourke. DAVE CARNEY: I mean, the guy is an ineffective, showboating gasbag. GOODWYN: Dave Carney is a veteran campaign organizer and the general consultant for Texans for Greg Abbott. CARNEY: We see this as an eight- to 10-point race. The undecided is so small. GOODWYN: Both campaigns have raised astounding amounts of money. Over the last few months, Beto O'Rourke raised $27.7 million. That set a new Texas campaign funding record. But don't cry for Governor Abbott. His campaign has over $45 million in the bank just waiting to be spent. Wade Goodwyn, NPR News, Dallas. Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "Pelosi's trip to Taiwan heightens U.S.-China tensions. Kansas voters reject a ballot initiative that would have allowed lawmakers to restrict abortion rights. Five states held primaries on Tuesday.  AMART\u00cdNEZ, HOST: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi spent the day in Taiwan on a visit that's been harshly criticized by Beijing. ASMA KHALID, HOST: Tensions have escalated with China's military drills around Taiwan, which Taipei claims could amount to an air and sea blockade. MART\u00cdNEZ: To bring us up to speed, we're joined now by NPR's John Ruwitch, who has been following events from Beijing. John, tell us, what Nancy Pelosi has been doing in Taiwan today. JOHN RUWITCH, BYLINE: Well, she spent the morning meeting Taiwanese members of Parliament, and then she met Taiwan's president, Tsai Ing-wen. Tsai awarded her a ceremonial civilian honor for her contributions in promoting Taiwan-U.S. relations. And in remarks at the event, Pelosi said that she visited Taipei to underscore the U.S. commitment to Taiwan. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) NANCY PELOSI: Today the world faces a choice between democracy and autocracy. America's determination to preserve democracy here in Taiwan and around the world remains ironclad. RUWITCH: You know, this is a highly symbolic visit. But there's more to the relationship than just political ideology. The Washington Post reported that in the afternoon, Pelosi was expected to meet the chairman of a Taiwanese company called TSMC, which is one of the world's leading makers of advanced microchips, which are, of course, a critical part of the U.S.-Taiwan relationship. MART\u00cdNEZ: Now, Beijing was not happy when she arrived in Taipei. What's been the reaction so far? RUWITCH: Well, the foreign ministry called the visit a violation of China's sovereignty. And the foreign ministry summoned the U.S. ambassador to make a formal complaint. You know, China has imposed also economic sanctions on some Taiwanese products coming into China, including citrus fruit, for example. It's also banned sand exports to Taiwan. And then, of course, there's the military component to all this. This week, China is holding several days of exercises in six zones that effectively encircle Taiwan. These are expected to be a large show of force. Taiwan says they encroach on its own territorial seas. Analysts, meanwhile, say we should expect more actions like this in the coming weeks, possibly months. And the White House, too, says that China is positioned for further steps. MART\u00cdNEZ: Well, OK. So why is Beijing doing this? I mean, what are they worried about? RUWITCH: Yeah. Well, it goes back to Beijing's claim that Taiwan is a part of China. You know, Beijing wants to unify it politically with the mainland under the Chinese flag. So one concern is that after Pelosi's visit, other senior officials from other foreign countries might be inclined to follow suit. Another concern of Beijing's is that U.S. policy on China is just being hollowed out. You know, the U.S. says it adheres to a \u201cOne China\u201d policy and that it doesn't support Taiwan independence. But the Chinese government's increasingly skeptical of that. MART\u00cdNEZ: We get a sense now of what the Chinese government thinks. What about the Chinese people? RUWITCH: Yeah. A lot of people here seem to be paying attention to this. Today, on the streets here in Beijing, we spoke with a man named Gong Buyang (ph), and here's what he had to say. GONG BUYANG: (Non-English language spoken). RUWITCH: Yeah. So he's saying he personally is unhappy with the Chinese response so far. He thinks it could be stronger. He also says, though, that he understands why the government is perhaps being cautious in its reaction in what he says is a game of geopolitical chess. It's really interesting. You know, when Pelosi's plane landed in Taipei last night, there were a lot of posts online in China expressing deep unhappiness that the Chinese government allowed it to happen, effectively - didn't prevent it. Many of those critical comments are just gone today. They've been scrubbed from the internet, which underscores the sensitivity of the issue, really. It shows the government is trying to manage expectations on a deeply emotive issue at a sensitive time for China, with the economy under pressure, the pandemic still a problem and a key Communist Party meeting coming up. MART\u00cdNEZ: NPR's John Ruwitch in Beijing. Thanks a lot, John. RUWITCH: Thanks, A. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MART\u00cdNEZ: Voters in Kansas have rejected a ballot initiative that would have allowed lawmakers to significantly restrict abortion rights in the state. It's the first time voters have weighed in on the issue since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade KHALID: Yep. And the proposed amendment was rejected by a wide margin, with nearly 60% voting no. At an election-night watch party, abortion rights supporters were overjoyed. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ASHLEY ALL: You know, really - I'm, like - I'm speechless. Like, that's where we're at right now. (CHEERING) KHALID: That was Ashley All, spokesperson for Kansas for Constitutional Freedom, speaking to supporters. MART\u00cdNEZ: For more on what this means, we go to NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben, who's in the Sunflower State. Danielle, Kansas abortion laws will still remain in place. Remind us of what those laws are right now. DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN, BYLINE: Sure. So right now Kansas allows abortion up to 22 weeks. And there are a number of restrictions on that. For example, there's a 24-hour waiting period that patients have to observe. And they also have to undergo an ultrasound before the procedure. Now, a big thing protecting the rights there are here is a 2019 state Supreme Court ruling that said the state constitution protects the right to abortion. Now, this amendment we're talking about - had it passed, it would have removed that constitutional protection, which would have cleared the way for all sorts of restrictions, including - potentially - a ban on the procedure. And experts that I spoke with said it was very likely that strict laws on abortion would have passed. So the fight is over for now. Though, one Democratic state representative I talked to last night said she's prepared for what she's calling a Republican backlash in November to oust Democratic Governor Laura Kelly. MART\u00cdNEZ: But so far, it sounds like a big victory. Is it? KURTZLEBEN: For abortion rights supporters, this is a huge victory. I mean, first of all, we had limited polling ahead of this. And it said that - excuse me - it said that this was going to be close, and it really wasn't. Furthermore, Kansas, as you know, is a pretty conservative state. A Democrat hasn't won the state's electoral votes since 1964. So this is a big win for abortion rights. Now, one way to look at this is that it's in part a reflection of what broad polling on abortion shows us, that most Americans want there to be at least some legal abortion. One more thing to note here is that the turnout was just huge. In 2018, primary turnout in the state was just north of 450,000. At latest count, more than 900,000 people voted on this measure. So to be clear, Kansas isn't now a blue or purple state. There are plenty of independents and Republicans who voted no. They thought this was too extreme. And I talked to some of them myself. But look, in county after county, we saw the pro-abortion rights vote far outperform what Joe Biden did in 2020. But come November, moderate voters may just be thinking about other issues, like inflation and crime, when they vote for Congress or governor. In other words, we shouldn't expect all these people to cross the aisle again. MART\u00cdNEZ: Yeah. I was thinking other states have a ballot measures about abortion this year. So does this maybe tell us anything about how those measures might do? KURTZLEBEN: Sure. Well, I mean, one state to look to is Michigan, which is much purpler. So this must be encouraging to abortion rights supporters there 'cause this - 'cause Kansas, of course, is just much redder. And this also just shows that abortion can mobilize voters really heavily. Logically, this would probably encourage Democrats running against strongly anti-abortion rights Republicans to lean hard into the issue. MART\u00cdNEZ: NPR political correspondent Danielle Kurtzleben. Thanks a lot. KURTZLEBEN: Yes. Thank you. MART\u00cdNEZ: Kansas is just one of five states that held primaries yesterday. KHALID: And there are already some significant results and some, of course, that we are still waiting on. MART\u00cdNEZ: To catch us up to date on what we know so far, let's bring in NPR senior political editor and correspondent Domenico Montanaro. All right. Let's start with what happened in Kansas. What do you think this could mean for November's elections? DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Well, it's a huge result. I mean, this isn't California or New York. And in talking to Republican strategists over the last few months - since the Roe decision was overturned by the Supreme Court, they've been concerned about how the Supreme Court's decision would affect the campaigns. You know, this is going to make them raise some eyebrows this morning because this result clearly shows where the energy is on this issue of abortion rights right now. And Republicans were on a glide path to take back the House and potentially the Senate. But this has the potential to help Democrats blunt some of those expected GOP gains. And it's partly why we've seen some Senate Democratic candidates, for example, inching ahead in some key places. MART\u00cdNEZ: Let's get to some other results. I know former President Trump has weighed in on a lot of races in these primaries. How did his candidates do this time? MONTANARO: Yeah. Let's start in Arizona. In the key Senate race there, Blake Masters, who had Trump's endorsement, won and will face Democrat Mark Kelly this fall. Masters - a venture capitalist who pushed Trump's policies and his election lies, by the way - he had big financial backing from his friend and mentor, PayPal founder Peter Thiel, who poured millions into this race. In the secretary of state's race, a Trump-backed conspiracy theorist and election denier won the GOP nomination. Mark Finchum is now the sixth election denier across the country to win the Republican nomination for a job that would control election administration in states. Four of those places are in key presidential swing states, A - Michigan, Nevada, New Mexico and now Arizona. And in a big race for governor there - the race is too close to call at this point - polls had shown Trump's preferred candidate, Kari Lake - also an election denier - well ahead. But only a couple of thousand votes now separate her from Karrin Taylor Robson, who had the endorsement of former Vice President Mike Pence. MART\u00cdNEZ: What about Republicans who voted for Trump's impeachment? What were the results with them? MONTANARO: Yeah. There were three Republicans on the ballot who voted for Trump's impeachment after January 6. And so far, one - moderate Republican Peter Meijer - lost in Michigan. The other two, both in Washington state - Jaime Herrera Beutler and Dan Newhouse - are ahead of Republican challengers. But only, you know, about half the vote or so is in there. And we don't expect to see a final result immediately. Meijer's loss is pretty significant, I have to say, because it gives Democrats now a pickup opportunity. This was a district where President Biden won in 2020. And the man who ousted Meijer, John Gibbs, is a former Trump appointee to the Department of Housing and Urban Development. He had Trump's endorsement and is far more hard line than Meijer. It's going to be a real test of whether a Trump candidate can win in a general election in a swing district. MART\u00cdNEZ: What about this test in terms of Trump's weight and support in America today? MONTANARO: Yeah. I mean, Trump clearly has a firm grip on the Republican Party. But he's still highly unpopular more broadly. And that - you know, like, a district like that one in Michigan - we're going to see how candidates with his policies and backing fare in purple places like Arizona and Michigan. Can a Blake Masters, for example, with hard-right Trump policies, win in Arizona over a more moderate candidate like Democrat Mark Kelly? And this is a hugely important Senate race because of how narrow the control of the Senate is right now, with it being 50-50 with Democrats ahead. Do these election deniers win secretary of state races that used to be won by fairly nonpartisan people when it comes to elections? - pretty big questions ahead of this fall. MART\u00cdNEZ: That's NPR's Domenico Montanaro. Thanks a lot. MONTANARO: A, you're welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF RY COODER'S \"PARIS, TEXAS\") Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.  All rights reserved.

With the midterm elections a month away, ad spending tells the story of what messages the candidates and their backers think will win with voters. For Democrats, there's been a significant increase in spending on ads related to abortion since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. And in many races, Republicans have amped up their ads accusing Democrats of being soft on crime. According to AdImpact, a firm that tracks ads, Democrats spent more than $73 million on television ads about abortion in September, nationwide. That represents about a third of all Democratic television ad spending. One such ad from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC), goes after Rep. Steve Chabot, the Republican incumbent in Ohio's 1st Congressional District. It accuses Chabot of being \"obsessed with banning abortion.\" About 30% of Democratic TV ad spending in September was on abortion-related messaging, accusing Republicans of being too extreme \u2014 such as this one targeting GOP Congressman Steve Chabot. Earlier this year, Democrats were spending virtually nothing on abortion-related messaging. Then came the Supreme Court decision, and a flood of restrictive new laws. Vriti Jain, who does strategic messaging at the DCCC, said abortion is proving to be an extremely galvanizing issue. \"It's really powerful,\" Jain said. \"It hits people really personally. And that's part of why you are seeing it show up on the airwaves across the country.\" Jain said it isn't just polls or new voter registration numbers that have Democrats convinced. She pointed to a special election in August in upstate New York, where the Democratic candidate, Pat Ryan, leaned in on abortion as an issue of freedom in his campaign. He won, outperforming President Biden's 2020 vote margin in the district. Longtime Republican operative Sarah Longwell has been spending time with swing voters this cycle for her podcast \"The Focus Group.\" She always starts by asking what voters are worried about. \"The economy comes up first every single time,\" she said. \"Crime comes up often.\" Abortion comes up less often, but Longwell said that issue matters a lot when the voters start talking about candidates who they won't vote for. The voters Longwell has spoken to are acutely aware of abortion stances when it comes to governors' races, because they have more influence than ever over access to abortion in their states. Dan Conston is president of the Congressional Leadership Fund, the House Republican super PAC backed by leader Kevin McCarthy. He said the Supreme Court ruling has complicated what could have otherwise been a Republican 'wave' election, given Biden's relatively low popularity, voter concerns about inflation and the economy, and historical patterns. For Democrats, abortion \"is the only message that they have,\" Conston said. While voters in swing districts tend to support abortion rights, Conston said Republicans are \"squarely focused on issues that we think the electorate cares most about \u2014 economic concerns, of which there are an endless number today, and concerns about public safety.\" Cue the ominous music. \"2020: murder in Cincinnati at an all-time high,\" says an ad from Conston's group, going after Democratic challenger Greg Landsman, a Cincinnati councilman. \"Greg Landsman's response: defund the police.\" This ad from the super PAC allied with House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy is part of a trend of GOP ads accusing Democratic candidates of being soft on crime. It's part of a trend in Republican messaging as the midterms get closer. According to an NPR analysis of data from AdImpact, Republicans spent close to $40 million on crime-related messaging in September, more than tripling the number of GOP ads on that issue on the air from the month before. Loading... While Republicans aren't responding directly to abortion-related attack messaging from Democrats, Democratic candidates have mounted a defense on crime. In Ohio, Landsman has an ad with men and women in uniform speaking directly to the camera to push back on the claim that he wants to defund the police, citing increased funding for law enforcement. Democrats have made a concerted effort to respond to Republican attacks on crime by promoting support they have from law enforcement, like this ad from Democratic candidate Greg Landsman. This was a lesson learned from 2020, when Republican ads accusing Democrats of wanting to defund the police proved effective, cutting into the Democratic majority in the House. In a memo obtained by NPR and sent in March to candidates in competitive districts, the DCCC encouraged candidates to seek out law enforcement endorsements. \"It is critical that candidates head into their election with at least one active or retired member of law enforcement who can go on the record and speak to their performance on the issues of crime and public safety,\" the March memo said. \"Given the time and resources that this will require, including vetting the validator, preparing them for potential media attention, and scripting and shooting an ad, the time to secure commitments from validators is now.\" The memo also implored all candidates in competitive races to have a ready answer for attacks portraying them as soft on crime or out to defund the police. \"One of the things that we found [in 2020] is that the attack on crime, the defund attack, often went unanswered, and that was something we needed to address head on,\" the DCCC's Jain said. Conston said Republican campaigns and outside groups aren't using crime-related messaging in every race \u2014 just the ones where it is most likely to stick, where the Democratic candidates or incumbents have expressed support for protesters, or talked about defunding or reprogramming funds for law enforcement. For Republicans, messages about rising crime play to emotions like fear and anger to try to motivate people to vote \u2014 a notable strategy in a key Senate race in Wisconsin, where last year a man out on bail allegedly drove his vehicle into a parade. In that state, 70% of Republican spending on digital advertising for the Senate race is focused on crime, while less than 15% is focused on the economy, said Guy Cecil, chairman of Priorities USA, a Democratic outside group that spends millions to try to mobilize voters, and also tracks online ad spending by both parties. \"When you want to know how candidates think they can win, you look at where they are spending their money,\" Cecil said.",

Leavitt would have been one of the first members of Generation Z elected to Congress, and the first Republican. The GOP, known as the Grand Old Party, isn't usually considered the political party of the young. In the midterm elections, a majority of Millennial and Generation Z voters \u2013 those under 41 \u2013 cast ballots for Democratic candidates, according to exit polls. \"This is the greatest challenge for the Republican Party today,\" said Karoline Leavitt, a 25-year-old Republican congressional candidate who lost in this year's election. \"The midterm results certainly proved that.\" Young conservatives like Leavitt are looking back at the midterms with a warning for their party: the political power of the youth vote can't be ignored. (The Republican National Committee did not respond to NPR's request for comment on this story.) In 2022, voters under 30 alone supported Democrats by a 28-point margin. These numbers fall slightly short of the record-breaking 2018 midterms but far surpass young Democrats' margins in 2014, which was the last time the party held both the presidency and the House. So, instead, to convince Millennials and members of Gen Z to vote for conservative candidates, Leavitt says Republicans need to hone in on certain issues young voters are passionate about, including environmental concerns and the cost of college and housing. But missing from that list is the topic of abortion. This cycle, Democrats championed a handful of social issues that young voters turned out for, notably safeguarding abortion access in the wake of the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe. v. Wade. That policy disconnect between young abortion advocates and young conservatives complicates the Republicans' revised outreach plans. Younger Republicans may also need to balance calls for change with the larger direction of the party \u2014 which is supported by an older and more conservative voter base. \"There's very little, to no chance for a Republican candidate to win the vote of a 'Zoomer' [a member of Gen Z] if they're not willing to recognize a woman's right to control her body,\" said John Della Volpe, the director of polling at the Harvard Kennedy School's Institute of Politics. The same argument applies to issues like protecting LGBTQ rights, curbing gun violence, and addressing climate change, Della Volpe says. \"If you're not willing to recognize those things, you can't have a conversation with Gen Z. If you can't have a conversation with Gen Z, you're not going [to be] able to motivate them to vote,\" he added. People in line at an early voting location on the campus of the University of Michigan.\n                \n                    \n                    JEFF KOWALSKY/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption People in line at an early voting location on the campus of the University of Michigan. That's why Republican Iowa state Rep. Joe Mitchell, 25, says conservatives can't shy away from addressing divisive topics. \"We have to be able to be unapologetic about our stances,\" said Michell, who also heads the organization Run GenZ, which supports young Republicans running for state and local office. \"Coming front and center on these issues to say, no, we believe in reasonable exceptions for these sorts of things,\" Mitchell said, referring to abortion, which he voted to restrict during his time in the Iowa legislature. On issues related to the environment and gun violence, Mitchell says Republicans have answers too. \"We believe in having a more renewable energy future when that works and when that's appropriate. And obviously, we want to make sure that kids are safe in school, and we just have different ideas of how to protect them,\" he said, adding, \"So, I think taking these issues head-on is important when they're asked about.\" Mitchell made history four years ago as the youngest person elected to the Iowa House of Representatives. He lost reelection this year to fellow Republican state Rep. Jeff Shipley, who, during the campaign, criticized Mitchell's support of LGBTQ rights. Like Mitchell, maintaining her stances unapologetically is 25-year-old Isabel Brown, a conservative media personality and contributor for the political organization Turning Point USA, one of the largest organizations created to nationally engage young Republicans. Brown thinks the Republican party needs to actively refocus away from just economic policy when talking to young voters. \"Generation Z is a very humanistic, empathy-first, feelings generation. We care about social and cultural issues far before we care about political issues,\" Brown said, adding, \"for whatever reason, in this last election, the Republican Party held on very substantially to the idea that people vote with their pocketbook and their wallet first. And we just didn't see that to be true.\" But social issues do not hand election victories to Republican candidates the way economic messaging does, says Republican pollster Jim Hobart, a partner at the firm Public Opinion Strategies. Students at the University of Pittsburg walk past a polling location on election day.\n                \n                    \n                    ANGELA WEISS/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Students at the University of Pittsburg walk past a polling location on election day. For Republican candidates, Hobart says, it's still more politically advantageous to allocate resources to courting older voters \u2013 especially in midterm election years where voters over 45 turn out at higher numbers and skew Republican. \"Yes, with infinite money, you would have a strategy to appeal to 18 to 34-year-olds, 35 to 54-year-olds and a 55-plus strategy, you spend equal amounts of money and all of them. The reality is that that's not typically the case,\" Hobart said. \"You do have to make these hard choices. And on average, where are you going to go? Where more voters are, both in terms of your likelihood to get them and their likelihood to turn out,\" he explained. But as the older electorate ages, Della Volpe points to one sobering data point: young voters will dominate the electorate over the next decade. In 2024 alone, nearly 40% of Millennials and Gen Zers are expected to vote. \"[The] Republican Party seems to only focus on taking everything they can get today and mortgaging the future of their party,\" Della Volpe said. \"If that's the game they're playing, they've been more successful than anyone would have thought. In terms of the Dobbs decision, those sorts of things, but to what cost?\" And while Republicans' path with young voters remains unclear, the same age group is not a safe bet for Democrats either. Despite voting with Democrats this cycle, recent NPR polling shows that just 41% of voters under 40 have a favorable opinion of the party \u2013 virtually tied with their view of Republicans at 42%. One-in-five is unsure of both parties. For youth organizers that ran grassroots voter campaigns for Democratic candidates this year, they haven't lost sight of that larger vulnerability. \"There absolutely is room for Republicans to make gains. And that's what keeps me up,\" said Dakota Hall, the executive director of the Alliance for Youth Action, one of several youth-led voter organizations that worked to propel Democratic candidates across the finish line this cycle. Young people dominated the polls this year\ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffd and we can thank youth organizers for that!Here is just a snapshot of how the youth organizers in Alliance Network turned out the #YouthVote in this year's midterm elections \u2b07\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/4euSI3q35d \"I think they can have infrastructure. They just don't know how to play it politically well with young people at this moment,\" Hall added, referring to Turning Point Action, the political organizing wing of Turning Point USA. Representatives from Turning Point Action did not respond to NPR's request for comment on mobilizing metrics. But founder and President Charlie Kirk as said that the organization \"directly contacted and engaged over 5 million voters.\" Ronna, thanks for asking. Turning Point logged more than 500k volunteer hours this election cycle.TPAction directly contacted and engaged over 5 million voters.We hosted well over 100 major door knocking events and rallies in target states and districts. (1/5) https://t.co/8ACHWgbQuw For Leavitt, keeping her own campaign experience in mind, Republicans need to address the age disparity in their voting base by restructuring their online outreach specifically \u2013 both on social media and with advertising. She can also acknowledge that her party lacks the same level of nationwide grassroots organizing that the Democrats have. \"It's not that young people in conservative households don't exist. Of course, they do,\" Leavitt added, \"But we're not mobilizing them in the vast way that the Democrats are.\"",

            "article_content": "Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis isn't talking about running for the Republican presidential nomination. But his fundraising and upcoming book release may be part of a stealth campaign.  JUANA SUMMERS, HOST: Republicans didnt see the so-called red wave they were hoping for this year's midterms, but the party did dominate in Florida. And the overwhelming reelection victory for Governor Ron DeSantis has seemed to solidify his position as a possible 2024 presidential contender. He hasn't publicly indicated he's ready to throw his hat in the ring, but NPR's Greg Allen took a closer look at the governor's stealth campaign for president. GREG ALLEN, BYLINE: DeSantis routinely dismisses questions about his presidential ambitions, saying he's focused on being Florida's governor. But there are some obvious signs that he's preparing to run. He has a candidate-ready autobiography due to be released early next year. He raised more than $200 million for his reelection for governor, has $90 million in the bank and is still fundraising. He was reelected after beating his Democratic challenger by nearly 20 points. It's an indication, DeSantis says, that he knows how to win. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) RON DESANTIS: We really showed, I think, how it's done in the state of Florida. And if you look at how we performed, no governor - Republican - has ever gotten a higher percentage of the vote in Florida history. ALLEN: Actually, Florida's first Republican governor, Harrison Reed, was elected by a wider margin during the Reconstruction era. But DeSantis' overwhelming victory sent a strong signal that Florida, once considered the nation's largest swing state, is now firmly in the Republican column. Republican media consultant Giancarlo Sopo says it strengthens his appeal as a national candidate. GIANCARLO SOPO: He knows how to excite Republican voters while also drawing in independents and moderate Democrats into the party. And that is exactly what Republicans should want. We want a big-tent party. A lackluster turn out by Democrats was also a major factor in DeSantis' big margin of victory. If DeSantis does decide to run for president while remaining governor, it will likely require a change to Florida law. Florida currently says state officeholders must resign their positions if they run for a federal office. But Republican lawmakers, including Senate president Kathleen Passidomo say, don't worry about the law. They'll repeal it. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KATHLEEN PASSIDOMO: If an individual who is from Florida, who is a Florida governor is running for president, I think he should be allowed to do it. ALLEN: As a possible Republican presidential candidate, DeSantis has a strong conservative track record. He tapped into public frustrations with COVID and led the fight against vaccine and mask mandates. He's promoted parental rights and signed into law restrictions on how race, sexual orientation and gender identity are discussed in the schools. He also approved a law banning abortions after 15 weeks. Those policies have made him a regular on Fox News, boosting his name recognition among Republican voters nationally. Some recent polls show him more popular with Republicans now than Trump. Trump, who's already announced he's running, has noticed. He said it would be a mistake for DeSantis to run and has already tried out an attack line, labeling him Ron DeSanctimonious (ph). DeSantis has largely avoided commenting on the attacks, dismissing them at one news conference as just noise. He rarely mentions the former president now, a far cry from his last election, when he ran a campaign ad which he read Trump's \"Art Of The Deal\" to his infant son. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DESANTIS: Then Mr. Trump said, you're fired. ALLEN: But University of North Florida political scientist Michael Binder says DeSantis is very much interested in Trump's supporters. MICHAEL BINDER: He wants to be kind of the Trump policy without all of the unhinged commentary and Twitter warfare and personal attacks. ALLEN: Binder expects DeSantis won't officially enter the Republican presidential contest any time soon. As governor, he can largely ignore Trump while talking to donors and traveling to states with early primaries. In how he responds to the former president, University of Florida political scientist Michael McDonald says he sees this and is focusing on issues, not personal attacks, taking a page from the guy who beat Trump. MICHAEL MCDONALD: It was Joe Biden. It was Sleepy Joe. DeSantis in some ways is fashioning himself out of the policy mold of Sleepy Joe Biden - somebody who's not throwing firebombs, someone who's just more focused on policy. ALLEN: As a popular governor in the third-largest state, DeSantis has a lot going for him. But running for president will put him under a spotlight. And University of North Florida's Michael Binder says there are still a lot of unknowns about DeSantis. BINDER: He hasn't been great on a debate stage. He isn't a particularly comfortable politicker in a sense of the small group, hand-to-hand shaking of the hands on the lines. He doesn't thrive in a stadium full of 20,000 people. ALLEN: For DeSantis supporters, there's another caveat. History often hasn't been kind to early presidential frontrunners. Just ask another popular former Republican governor, Scott Walker of Wisconsin. He peaked early before the 2016 election and was knocked out of the race by Donald Trump. Greg Allen, NPR News, Miami.

            "article_content": "In 2022, voters expanded Medicaid in South Dakota, legalized recreational marijuana in Missouri, and enshrined the right to an abortion in Michigan. This was possible because in about half of all U.S. states, citizens have the power to pass laws or amend the state's constitution themselves, sidestepping lawmakers. Such ballot initiatives have become a popular tactic to change policy in states dominated by one party, often the GOP. That's led to pushback from state lawmakers. Loading... That backlash \"really accelerated in 2021 and 2022,\" says Kelly Hall, executive director with The Fairness Project. That group claims success in 31 of the 33 left-leaning ballot initiatives it has supported since 2016. At the same time, there has been an increase in the number of bills to tweak the initiative process, from 33 in 2017 to more than a 100 in 2021 and 2022, according to the Ballot Initiative Strategy Center, a group which provides research and support to groups promoting ballot measures. While not all would restrict the process, many propose new requirements for the number of signatures needed, where the signatures must come from, or increase the threshold to pass a measure. Some are simply cumbersome, like \"requiring the language to be printed all on one sheet of paper, meaning you have to carry around a bath towel-size petition,\" Hall says. While not impossible to follow, these new rules add up to \"death by a thousand cuts\" for future initiatives, she says. This year, lawmakers in three states succeeded in getting some of these restrictions on the ballot, asking voters to decide. Arkansas and South Dakota voters rejected the limits, but Arizonans approved two out of three. They rejected a measure that would have allowed legislators amend or repeal ballot measures found to contain illegal language. But they approved a measure to increase the vote threshold to pass initiatives, including constitutional amendments, or referendums to 60% if they raise taxes, and another limiting initiatives to one subject. In November, Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose announced a plan to raise the threshold for voters to approve a constitutional amendment to 60%.\n                \n                    \n                    Andy Chow/Ohio Public Radio\n                    \n                \nhide caption In November, Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose announced a plan to raise the threshold for voters to approve a constitutional amendment to 60%. Just weeks after the November election, Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose, a Republican, and Republican Rep. Brian Stewart rolled out a resolution that would require all future constitutional amendments to receive a 60% supermajority at the polls, rather than the current 50%. \"This is about trying to make the Ohio constitution less susceptible to special interests,\" LaRose said. This comes as advocates for abortion rights, legal marijuana use and redistricting reform are all gearing up to put their issue on the ballot in Ohio in 2023 or 2024. Since 2018 voters in Missouri approved ballot initiatives to raise the minimum wage from $7.85 to $12 over five years, expand Medicaid, and legalize marijuana. In 2022, Missouri lawmakers responded by introducing more bills to restrict constitutional amendments than any other state. \"I think the recent passage of recreational marijuana, which you know I oppose, maybe indicates it's a little too easy to get things through initiative petition,\" says Missouri's new Republican state Senate majority leader, Cindy O'Laughlin. On average, fewer than half of all citizen-initiated measures pass, according to Ballotpedia. But targeted campaigns in support of economic or social issues that are popular with a majority of voters have had success even in conservative states. Advocates for direct democracy say lawmakers are simply out of sync with their own constituents. \"What's clear here is that this is an effort to block the people of Ohio's ability to amend our constitution and to ensure that we can enshrine rights and protections for the people that obviously Ohio Republicans don't want us to have,\" says Katy Shanahan with the Equal Districts Coalition, a group that opposes partisan gerrymandering in Ohio. In the coming election cycles, reproductive rights groups say they are looking into initiatives in at least 10 states where abortion is currently banned or heavily restricted. In 2022, voters affirmed the right to an abortion or rejected restrictions to it in every state where it was on the ballot. That included states such as Kentucky and Kansas where Republicans control the legislature. \"While an issue may be couched as partisan, when we actually put them before voters, they transcend those party lines,\" says Chris Melody Fields Figueredo, executive director of the Ballot Initiative Strategy Center. Changes to the process could make future wins less likely. The tallies in some of those votes fell short of the 60% threshold many Republican lawmakers are now seeking for constitutional amendments. In December, GOP lawmakers in Ohio failed to pass the resolution to raise the vote threshold for constitutional amendments before the end of the lame duck session. But they say they'll try again in 2023. Jason Rosenbaum of St. Louis Public Radio contributed to this report.",

Ron DeSantis won reelection by a wide margin, reinforcing his position as a strong contender for the party's presidential nomination in 2024. But DeSantis isn't showing signs that he is ready to officially announce his candidacy. He says he's focused on being governor and dismisses questions about presidential ambitions. But for anyone who looks, there are some obvious signs that he's preparing to run. He has an autobiography titled The Courage to Be Free due to be released early next year. The publisher's press release says it is the story of a governor who, \"has fought\u2014and won\u2014battle after battle, defeating not just opposition from the political left, but a barrage of hostile media coverage proclaiming the end of the world.\" DeSantis raised more than $200 million for his reelection for governor, including $10 million in a single donation from a Las Vegas real estate developer, much more than he needed. He currently has at least $90 million in the bank and is still fundraising. His immense campaign fund helped him beat his Democratic challenger, Charlie Crist, by nearly 20 points. At a recent news conference, DeSantis said, \"We really showed, I think, how it's done in the state of Florida,\" and went on to say he received the highest percentage of the vote for a GOP governor in the history of Florida. Actually, Florida's first Republican governor, Harrison Reed, was elected by a wider margin during the Reconstruction era.

Others point to a lackluster turnout by Democrats as a major factor in DeSantis' big margin of victory. Here are some of the possible reasons why DeSantis hasn't announced a run for president, yet: If DeSantis decides to run for president while remaining governor, it will likely require a change to Florida law. Florida currently says state officeholders must resign their positions if they run for a federal office. But Republican lawmakers, including state Senate President Kathleen Passidomo, say don't worry about the law \u2014 the legislature will repeal it. \"When you think about it,\" Passidomo recently told reporters, \"if an individual who ... is a Florida governor is running for president, he should be allowed to do it.\" As a possible Republican presidential candidate, DeSantis has a strong conservative track record. He tapped into public frustrations with COVID-19 and led the fight against vaccine and mask mandates. He's promoted \"parental rights\" and signed into law restrictions on how race, sexual orientation and gender identity are discussed in the schools. He also approved a law banning abortions after 15 weeks. Those policies have made him a regular on Fox News, boosting his name recognition among Republican voters nationally. Some recent polls show him more popular with Republicans than Donald Trump. Trump, who's already announced he's running, has noticed. He's said it would be a \"mistake\" for DeSantis to enter the race. He's already tried out an attack line, labeling him Ron \"DeSanctimonious.\" DeSantis has largely avoided commenting on the attacks, dismissing them at one news conference as \"just noise.\" He rarely mentions the former president now, a far cry from his last election when he ran a campaign ad in which he read Trump's Art of the Deal to his infant son. \"He wants to be kind of the Trump policy without all of the unhinged commentary and Twitter warfare and personal attacks,\" says University of North Florida political scientist Michael Binder. DeSantis is very much interested in Trump's supporters, Binder says, \"and I think he's found himself a very nice niche there.\" Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis gives two thumbs up to former President Donald Trump as Trump speaks during his campaign event on Oct. 23, 2020 in The Villages, Fla.

Ron DeSantis gives two thumbs up to former President Donald Trump as Trump speaks during his campaign event on Oct. 23, 2020 in The Villages, Fla. DeSantis is expected to announce he will run for president in 2024 against Trump. Binder expects DeSantis won't officially enter the Republican presidential contest anytime soon. One reason is that as he soon as he does, it will likely spark open warfare with Trump. As governor, DeSantis can largely ignore Trump while also talking to donors and traveling to states with early 2024 primaries. University of Florida political scientist Michael McDonald says he sees DeSantis focusing on issues, not personal attacks \u2014 taking a page from the guy who beat Trump. \"It was 'Sleepy Joe,' \" McDonald says, using Trump's nickname for the president. \"And DeSantis in some ways is fashioning himself out of the ... mold of Sleepy Joe Biden, somebody who's not throwing firebombs, someone who's just more focused on policy.\" As a popular governor in the third-largest state, DeSantis has a lot going for him. But running for president would put him in the spotlight. And University of North Florida's Binder says there are still a lot of unknowns about DeSantis. \"He hasn't been great on a debate stage,\" Binder says. \"He isn't a particularly comfortable politicker in a sense of the small group, hand-to-hand shaking of the hands on the lines. He doesn't thrive in a stadium full of 20,000 people.\" For DeSantis supporters, there is another caveat. History often hasn't been kind to early presidential frontrunners. Just ask another popular former Republican governor, Scott Walker of Wisconsin. He peaked early before the 2016 election and was knocked out of the race by Trump himself.",

            "article_content": "Georgia's runoff election captured national attention but with votes being tallied in the last  U.S. Senate race of 2022 is finally over.  RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: The final race of the 2022 midterms is over. Incumbent Democratic Senator Raphael Warnock from Georgia has defeated his opponent, Republican Herschel Walker. The victory gives Democrats a crucial 51-49 advantage in the U.S. Senate and solidifies Georgia's status as a political battleground state. Georgia Public Broadcasting's Stephen Fowler joins us now to talk about the results and their consequences. Hey, Stephen. STEPHEN FOWLER, BYLINE: Good morning. MARTIN: So a whole lot of money went into this race and lots of national attention. Remind us how we got here. FOWLER: So Raphael Warnock won a special election in a runoff in January, 2021, and has used that time in office so far to focus on legislation lowering health care costs. And he really hammered home this idea that he's a bipartisan moderate willing to do whatever it takes to help Georgians, even working across the aisle with the Republicans at a time where that's not really happening a lot. Here's a snippet of Warnock's victory speech. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) RAPHAEL WARNOCK: I am Georgia. (CHEERING, APPLAUSE) WARNOCK: I am an example and an iteration of its history... UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Yes. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Yeah. WARNOCK: ...Of its pain and its promise of the brutality and the possibility. FOWLER: Now, Walker, on the other hand, spent most of his campaign dodging controversies about his past, including serious allegations of domestic violence, fabricating his past and personal achievements, and, maybe most importantly, allegedly pressuring multiple ex-girlfriends to have abortions despite his public stance opposing abortion. And on the policy front, he really stuck to a far-right agenda that catered more to the GOP base than a diverse swing state. MARTIN: So how did Warnock pull this off? FOWLER: Well, a lot of people voted and especially voted early in person. Democrats took full advantage of extra optional days of early voting offered in some of the larger counties, particularly the Saturday after Thanksgiving, which was only an option after Warnock's campaign actually sued the state to make it happen. There was actually more turnout than you would expect for an early December race in a runoff. About 3.5 million people voted. But the difference is, across the board, Warnock lost Republican counties by a little bit less than November and won urban and suburban counties by a little more than he did in November. Walker also continued to underperform incumbent Governor Brian Kemp's November margins in Republican areas that were just turned off by his campaign. And remember, Georgia is an outlier by holding these types of runoffs when no candidate in a general election gets above 50%. So things were really unpredictable heading into Election Day from a turnout perspective. MARTIN: Yeah. So Democrats have not only retained control of the U.S. Senate, they actually have now picked up a seat. What does Warnock's victory mean for the next two years in Congress? FOWLER: Well, it's a big deal to Democrats. In some ways, it's even a bigger deal than those 2021 runoffs that got the Senate to 50-50. For starters, no more power sharing on committees, which has limited some of the action Democrats could take the last two years. It also somewhat neuters the impact of fellow Democratic Senators Kyrsten Sinema and Joe Manchin, moderates who sometimes serve as roadblocks to President Biden's agenda. And, Rachel, because it's always election season, especially here in Georgia, it gives Democrats one more seat for a 2024 election map that's a little bit tougher for them. That's also keeping Georgia at the forefront of battleground status for the White House, reflected in a proposed new Democratic presidential primary calendar, which puts Georgia among some of the early states to decide the party's nominee. So at any rate, there's a lot more political and economic capital routing through the Peach State these next few years. MARTIN: You're going to be busy. Little job security for you, Stephen.

More than 3.5 million voters cast ballots in the runoff, down from about 3.9 million in November. In an election that hinged as much on the personalities of the two candidates as the policies they promoted, Warnock embraced his identity as a pastor to draw contrasts with his opponent, whose candidacy was dogged by controversy. There's no excuses in life and I am not going to make any excuses now because we put up one heck of a fight. Herschel Walker 12/6/2022 Throughout the campaign, Walker stumbled to respond to allegations of domestic violence and claims that he paid for ex-girlfriends' abortions, despite expressing support for a nationwide ban on the procedure. He was also prone to gaffes and false claims, exaggerating his record in academics and business and displaying a loose grasp of policy. Walker delivered a short concession speech at the College Football Hall of Fame. \"There's no excuses in life and I am not going to make any excuses now because we put up one heck of a fight,\" Walker told supporters. This is Warnock's second runoff win in less than two years. In January 2021, he won another runoff contest to fill out the term of a retiring Republican, flipping the seat blue for the first time in years and clinching Democratic control of the Senate. On election night, Warnock cast his story and his campaign as an embodiment of Georgia. He was joined on stage by his two young children and his mother. He often talks about his mother growing up picking someone else's cotton and now picking her son to be a U.S. senator.

The campaign between Walker and Warnock made history as the first time two African Americans ran as the major party's nominees for U.S. Senate from Georgia. Tuesday's runoff was the latest barometer of whether Democrats' electoral victories in Georgia last cycle signaled a new era in the state's politics. The race also reflected the extent of Donald Trump's influence post-presidency. Walker, who Trump urged to run, was the only Georgia Republican not to win outright in November.

Raphael Warnock, D-Ga., waves to supporters as he arrives at a campaign rally Monday at Georgia Tech in Atlanta. On the campaign trail, Warnock touted his bipartisan bonafides in Washington, even as Walker sought to tie him to President Biden, whose approval ratings are underwater in Georgia. Especially in the final weeks of the campaign, Warnock explicitly appealed to independents and Republican-leaning voters hesitant about Walker to support him instead. \"This is not about right and left,\" Warnock told voters before a rally with former President Barack Obama last week in Atlanta. \"This is about the difference between right and wrong.\" In November, Walker won about 200,000 fewer votes than Republican Gov. Brian Kemp. The gap was most pronounced in Atlanta's northern suburbs, once Republican strongholds that have trended toward Democrats in recent years. \"My vote isn't bound by party alone,\" says Cameron Lewellen, who voted for Kemp in November and for Warnock both times. \"It does actually matter what you say because I'm an American first and a Republican second.\" While Walker's campaign tried to focus on the economy, his stump speech catered largely to the state's most conservative voters, devoting as much time to criticizing transgender people in sports and the military as talking about inflation. His speeches were often light on policy and leaned heavily into his personal story and humorous anecdotes, including one now-infamous aside about werewolves and vampires. \"We need leaders in Washington who say if you don't like the rules of the United States of America you can leave,\" Walker recently told a crowd gathered inside a community gymnasium in Dalton. \"That's what we need right now.\" The campaigns and outside groups spent roughly $80 million in television advertising for the four-week runoff. More than 1.8 million Georgians cast ballots by the end of early voting last week. Multiple days broke records for daily, in-person voting, reflecting both enthusiasm and a Republican-backed election law that condensed the runoff window from nine weeks to four. At some early vote locations, voters waited in lines for more than two hours to cast their ballots. Born 115 miles and seven years apart, Walker and Warnock followed diverging paths to the heights of two of the most important institutions in the South \u2014 the church and college football.

Warnock is the senior pastor at the church once led by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and on the trail often channeled his hero's emphasis on the overlap between activism and faith. And so it was fitting that on the final weekend of campaigning, Warnock carved out his Sunday morning to preach from his pulpit at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta.

Democrats have failed in modern times to motivate the rural voting base. But some Democratic candidates in key toss-up and open races in the midterms may have fared better among the rural population than previously believed. Strong performances in states like Illinois, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Washington showed Democrats can sustain and win over rural areas, where Republicans have generally done well. Even in places like North Carolina, Georgia and Colorado, Democrats proved to be competitive, running up margins of past elections and flipping some districts, even if they did not always win. \"I think there's like a coming to Jesus moment, for lack of a better analogy, around if Democrats are going to like make a more full-throated decision and investment to contest for the rural vote,\" said George Goehl, a community organizer with a focus on rural areas. \"And I think this election shows what's possible, even in many cases without resources, and that the rural vote is not static.\" Goehl said that it's not likely that Democrats will win the majority of rural votes anytime soon, but \"lot of blue dots in red places is a key part of how they win.\" Pennsylvania Democratic Sen.-elect John Fetterman takes the stage at an election night party in Pittsburgh on Nov. 9.\n                \n                    \n                    Gene J.

Pennsylvania's Democratic Sen.-elect John Fetterman was successful in flipping a seat previously held by Republican Sen. Pat Toomey who announced his retirement. Fetterman's election night victory was attributable to not only strong performance in suburban areas but also by increasing the margins of success in rural districts. Fetterman spent a portion of his campaign specifically focusing on rural communities and ultimately won a greater share of the votes in nearly every county compared to Joe Biden's 2020 performance. \"If you look at John Fetterman, [he] very much ran a 'both/and approach',\" said Matt Hildreth, executive director of Rural Organizing, a progressive rural organizing firm. \"John Fetterman was able to mobilize the base and also engage voters outside of the traditional Democratic base, specifically voters in small towns and rural communities.\" The same was true for the state's Democratic Gov.-elect Josh Shapiro. Both Fetterman and Shapiro won their races by more points than Biden did when he turned the state blue during the 2020 election. Former President Donald Trump won Pennsylvania in 2016. Democrats were also able to clinch a House win in Washington's 3rd District. Home to 781,000 people, voters elected Marie Gluesenkamp Perez over Trump-backed Joe Kent, flipping the seat to the Democrats. That seat, which has been held by a Republican since 2011, had previously toggled between Democratic and Republican members \u2014 though it has mostly voted for the GOP presidential candidate. \"I do think Democrats ran some more candidates that are seen as working class that knew how to speak kind of common sense,\" said Goehl. \"I think a lot of progressives and Democrats speak a language that sounds more like the ivory tower than the street or the road.\" In Illinois' 17th District, Eric Sorensen succeeded in retaining the seat made vacant by the retirement of Democratic Rep. Cheri Bustos, who held the seat through four election cycles, each time winning by higher margins \u2014 even though the district voted for Trump in the last two elections. Sorensen's 3-point win also secures a Democratic seat outside of the Chicago metropolitan area. Republican U.S. Sen.-elect J.D.

Vance speaks during an election night watch party Nov. 8 in Columbus, Ohio. In Ohio, Democrat Rep. Tim Ryan ran a competitive race against Trump-endorsed Republican J.D. Vance but ultimately lost. Ryan trailed Vance by 264,000 votes (or 6.6 points) compared to the last Senate race for this seat in 2016 when the Democratic candidate lost by over 1 million votes (or 21 points). But closing the gap was not enough. \"Tim Ryan really focused on persuading voters outside of the Democratic base and oftentimes found himself at odds with the Democratic base,\" Hildreth explained. \"What we found is that really turned off base voters in Ohio and any of the gains that he was able to make up through those efforts were undercut by low turnout amongst the base.\" Voter turnout in Ohio was about 5% lower than in 2018. \"I think it was just a failure to excite the base,\" he said. In Georgia, a Senate Agriculture Committee member, Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock, spent time campaigning in some of the rural farmlands of the state. However, he did not get the 50% total vote count needed to avoid a runoff. That race is still ongoing and the next election will take place on Dec. 6. Warnock is already planning new campaign events in rural areas. Both parties are already setting the stage for the 2024 election, which includes a presidential ticket and likely higher turnout. The Biden administration will be faced with the challenge of how to communicate its policy platforms in rural areas \u2014 many items, like health care, student debt relief and abortion protection, are popular among some rural demographics. But rural advocates say that the party often fails to communicate its policies to rural voters. \"The one disconnect that we see is that Democrats tend to contact rural voters at much lower rates,\" Hildreth of Rural Organizing said. \"I have a lot of questions about what the White House is going to do, frankly. Like, what is the lesson that the White House will take from this election? And will they listen to these Democrats who showed up and listened, have an agenda and are delivering results? Or will they take the advice that those Democrats are giving them and invest more at a national level?\" Hildreth asked. \"I hope they do that. I don't know that they will,\" he said. Both parties are also facing evolving rural demographics. Recent 2020 Census data found rural areas are diversifying even as their populations are declining. Latinos, for example, are one of the fastest growing populations in rural, nonmetropolitan areas, and minorities make up nearly a quarter of all residents in these parts of the country. \"And so when we write these communities off, we're not only writing off the rural white vote, but we're also writing off rural voters of color,\" said Goehl, the rural community organizer. \"And I think writing off either is a big mistake.\"",

Mary Peltola smiles before a debate for Alaska's sole U.S. House seat on Oct. 26, in Anchorage, Alaska. Peltola was elected to a full term in the House on Wednesday, Nov. 23, months after the Alaska Democrat won a special election to the seat following the death earlier this year of longtime Republican Rep. Don Young. JUNEAU, Alaska \u2014 U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola has been elected to a full term in the House, months after the Alaska Democrat won a special election to the seat following the death earlier this year of longtime Republican Rep. Don Young. Peltola defeated Republicans Sarah Palin and Nick Begich, as well as Libertarian Chris Bye in the Nov. 8 election. Results of the ranked choice election were announced Wednesday. Palin and Begich also were candidates in the special election. \"It's a two-year contract,\" Peltola told the Anchorage Daily News after her victory \u2014 a 55%-45% margin over Palin in the final tabulation round \u2014 was announced. \"I will be happy to work for Alaskans again, as long as they'll have me.\" Peltola, who is Yup'ik, with her win in August became the first Alaska Native to serve in Congress and the first woman to hold Alaska's House seat. The win also buoyed her fundraising, outpacing those of her rivals in the lead-up to this month's election. Messages were sent to Palin's campaign Wednesday. Begich congratulated Peltola in a statement, adding: \"Our nation faces a number of challenges in the coming years, and our representatives will need wisdom and discernment as they work to put America on a more sound path. My message to Alaskans is to continue to be involved and engaged.\" Peltola embraced Young's legacy as she sought the two-year term and was endorsed by his daughters, one of whom presented her with a bolo tie of Young's at an Alaska Federation of Natives conference where Peltola was treated like a rock star. Young held the seat for 49 years. \"Now, I'm a real congressman for all Alaska,\" she said. Young often referred to himself that way. Peltola has described his legacy as one of bipartisanship and building support for Alaska interests in Congress. Peltola was a state lawmaker from the small rural hub community of Bethel for 10 years, ending in 2009. She surprised many with her fourth place finish in the June special primary, in which she emerged from a field of 48 candidates that included current state and local officeholders. That finish was enough to send her to the special election. During the campaign, she cast herself as a coalition builder, emphasized a desire for more civility in politics and sought to stay out of the sniping between Palin and Begich. Peltola, who most recently worked for a commission whose goal is to rebuild salmon in Alaska's Kuskokwim River, raised concerns with ocean productivity and cited a need to preserve struggling fisheries. She also stressed her support of abortion rights. During a speech in October, she talked about the need for unity and lamented what she said have become pervasive messages in politics \"about hate and fear and self-pity. And yes, those resonate, those are compelling motivators. But they're destructive, they're acidic, they tear us down.\" She said her priorities for the new term included committee assignments and \"working very hard on getting our inflation rates down, our shipping costs down, getting costs down for working families and all Alaskan households.\"",

            "article_content": "Secretary of state candidates who deny the 2020 election results generally underperformed fellow Republicans on the ballot in a handful of competitive states, reports NPR's Miles Parks.  RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: We learned a lot from the 2022 midterms. Abortion access matters to voters, Florida might not be a swing state anymore, and election denialism is not a winning strategy. NPR's Miles Parks covers voting, and he's been reporting on that last point a whole lot in the last two weeks since voting ended. Hi, Miles. MILES PARKS, BYLINE: Hey, Rachel. Good morning. MARTIN: Nice to see you in studio. So we know some pretty high-profile candidates who denied the 2020 election results - they actually lost their races this year - Doug Mastriano in Pennsylvania, Kari Lake in Arizona. But you have a new analysis out that shows these kinds of candidates did especially bad in races to control elections, right? PARKS: Right. So I've been really interested in monitoring secretary of state races all across the country, because they're really the clearest question of how voters feel about election conspiracies. Do you want a person in charge of voting in your state who spews lies about the 2020 election, right? And voters overwhelmingly said no specifically to that question. Our analysis found that election deniers consistently underperformed other Republicans on the ballot in all of these races and in competitive states. MARTIN: Although these are down-ballot races, right? Isn't normal for these candidates to get fewer votes? PARKS: It is, right. But this is actually where it gets really interesting because Republicans who did not deny the 2020 election results did not see the same drop off in support. So we looked at seven different swing states. In the five races where there was an election denier running as the nominee for one of these positions, they got on average about 93% of the votes of the top vote-getter at the top of the ballot. But in the two states, Georgia and Colorado, where there wasn't an election denier running for secretary of state, those candidates ran neck and neck with the top vote-getters. In Georgia, for instance, Brad Raffensperger, you know, of the 2020 fame, won his reelection by about nine percentage points. And his opponent Bee Nguyen told NPR's Michel Martin that he was really hard to beat specifically because he did not deny the election results. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) BEE NGUYEN: We also had a larger challenge in Georgia, running against incumbents who were not seen as extremist to Georgia voters. And so going up against that is obviously an uphill battle. PARKS: We also saw Democrats pour money into helping election deniers win primaries in some places earlier this year because it's clear that they felt like these candidates were beatable, and they turned out they were right. MARTIN: Right. Very controversial at the time and turned out to have been a winning strategy for Democrats, at least. So has this proven to the GOP that supporting candidates who do not support the integrity of our election system is not a winning strategy? PARKS: In a normal situation, I think you would assume so. The data here is pretty clear. But the shadow of Donald Trump still plays a big role here. He's the leader of the Republican Party. He has already announced that he's running in 2024, and he has continued for the past two years to keep pushing these narratives around a stolen election. So you have to expect many candidates in the Republican Party will still parrot these stolen election narratives to try to win primaries. It's a winning strategy with base voters, but it's clear that it does not translate to the broader electorate. I talked about that with Trey Grayson, who's a former Republican secretary of state of Kentucky. TREY GRAYSON: Voters sent a pretty loud message about election denialism. The voters took that information, processed it, said, we reject those candidates. We're going to reward the candidates who will do their jobs, who will follow the law. PARKS: After looking at our data analysis of these races, Grayson told me a lot of these swing states - they should have been shoo-in for Republicans based on the political climate that we've been talking about all year - inflation, the first midterm of Biden's presidency. But my party, he said - we didn't nominate the right people. MARTIN: NPR's Miles Parks. Miles, thanks for this. We appreciate it. PARKS: Thanks, Rachel. Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.

            "article_content": "Former Vice President Mike Pence's new memoir recounts his life up to the moment when he refused to overturn the 2020 election defeat of then-President Donald Trump. So Help Me God is the kind of polished life story that is often a preliminary for a presidential run, which Pence is considering. Coincidentally or not, the book's release date, Nov. 15, was exactly the date that Trump declared his run for the presidency in 2024. Trump's announcement competed with but did not entirely drown out Pence, who has given interviews about his book to multiple networks and newspapers in recent weeks. It was revealing that, after the midterm election defeat of numerous high-profile candidates who rejected the 2020 election results, Trump's announcement speech did not directly mention his claims about his defeat \u2014 a subject he'd discussed constantly for two years, including in a January interview with NPR. Instead, Pence is the one discussing it, saying that Trump was \"wrong\" and that they have gone \"our separate ways.\" Pence faces an extraordinary challenge as a political leader whose national reputation is closely tied to the record of the Trump administration but who says the Constitution and his conscience would not allow him to follow Trump's ultimate demand. The former vice president met an NPR team at the law library of the Indiana state capitol: a fitting spot, both because he once served as the state's governor and because upholding the law is now at the center of the story he has to tell. For part of the 42-minute conversation, Pence recounted the events of Jan. 6, 2021, when he presided over the ceremonial counting of electoral votes from the 2020 presidential election. When a mob disrupted the proceedings, Pence retreated with family members to an office within the U.S. Capitol and then to an underground parking garage, but refused to flee the building. \"It just infuriated me,\" he said, and once police had restored control of the building, he managed that evening to preside over the completion of the vote count. Eventually he learned that many members of the mob, egged on by a tweet from the president, had chanted to hang him. \"President Trump was wrong, and his words and actions that day were reckless,\" Pence said. \"They endangered my family and people at the Capitol building. And I'll never hold any other view.\" Q. Is Trump a good man?A. \u201cOnly God knows.\u201dFormer Vice President Mike Pence recounts the January 6 attack, when then-president Trump\u2019s words sparked a mob to seek out Pence. From the @NPR interview coming Tuesday: pic.twitter.com/cGLUZyVHpo That's a far cry from the speech that Pence, chosen as Trump's running mate, gave at the 2016 Republican National Convention, in which he called Trump a \"good man.\" Asked whether he still considers Trump a good man, Pence replied at considerable length without ever saying that he did. He said only that Trump had authored important achievements but was \"wrong\" on Jan. 6. \"I truly do believe that only God knows our hearts,\" he added. \"And I'll leave it to others to make their own judgments.\" Pence spoke with NPR's Morning Edition about his faith, his political trajectory and where he thinks he and his party might be headed next. The full transcript of that conversation can be found here. This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity. On the Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade I'm pro-life. I don't apologize for it. I'll always cherish the fact that I was vice president in the administration that appointed three of the justices of the Supreme Court that gave us a new beginning for life, that returned the question of abortion to the states and to the American people, where it belongs. ... I said in the wake of the Dobbs decision that we haven't come to the end \u2014 we've come to the end of the beginning. And I'm determined in however many years I have left on this earth to be a voice for the unborn and to work every day to restore the sanctity of life to the center of American law. ... Whatever role we're in, I'll look to be a voice for the right to life. On the fact that midterm voters were generally favorable to abortion rights The common denominator for me was that Republicans who articulated their position on the right to life did well. Republicans who did not articulate their position and allowed their position to be defined did not do as well. ... I want to concede a point. We have a ways to go in this issue. But I believe that in the most prosperous nation on Earth, we ought to be a nation that is grounded in the unalienable right to life and makes it possible for women in crisis pregnancies to go to term or raise their child or give their child up for adoption. But I also think it's just as important, as you see states advance pro-life legislation, that they advance legislation not just for the unborn, but for the newborn. On why, as he says in his book, he thinks his faith has been \"misunderstood\" When my wife was attacked for teaching at a Christian school, when one media outlet after another ridiculed our Christian faith from time to time, I was always struck by that. Because as I traveled around America, the words I most often heard, and I heard them every day, where people would reach out across a rope line or stop me on a street corner and say, \"I'm praying for you.\" I mean, this is a nation of faith, of different faiths. I'm a born-again Christian, raised in a wonderful Catholic home. But the American people cherish faith in the overwhelming majority, and yet it seemed to be a subject of fascination by some in the liberal media. On whether he thinks people misunderstand his stance on LGBTQ issues I don't believe anyone should ever be harassed or discriminated against because of who they are, who they love or what they believe. But that being said, there are profound implications on this question, as Justice Kennedy wrote in the Obergefell decision, that bear upon religious freedom \u2014 and the courts have been sorting through that ever since. I will tell you, I've been encouraged that the Supreme Court has been striking a balance on the issues of religious liberty and individual rights, and I trust that the conservatives on the court will continue to do that. But if there's anything people don't understand well about the Pences is ... to know our family, we love everybody. My faith tells me to love your neighbor as yourself. And that's something we aspire to do every day, whether we agree with every view or every value of the people that we meet. On what Pence would want to accomplish if elected president Traveling around this country, what I've heard from the American people is they want to get back to the policies of the Trump-Pence administration: of a strong military, of free market economics, conservatives on our courts, America standing with our allies, standing up to our enemies. But I think they long for leadership that could unite our country around our highest ideals and demonstrate the kind of respect and civility that the American people show each other every day.

Kennedy was reelected to the court, this time as its chief justice.\n                \n                    \n                    Andrew Spear/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Republican state Supreme Court Justice Sharon Kennedy speaks to supporters at an election watch party at the Renaissance Hotel on Nov. 8, in Columbus, Ohio. Kennedy was reelected to the court, this time as its chief justice. In the next year, state courts around the country will weigh in on abortion rights, redistricting and voting access. Unlike U.S. Supreme Court justices, who are appointed, many state supreme court justices just went through an election. The midterms resulted in few shakeups, but GOP wins in Ohio and North Carolina Supreme Court tee up changes to the legal landscape in those states. Looking ahead, here's how those wins will influence state policy decisions, as well as the balance of power in Washington. This year, Ohioans reelected three Republican state supreme court justices, defeating Democratic challengers. This is the bench that will likely hear a challenge to Ohio's ban on abortion after six weeks, as well as litigation around the state's voting maps. While the GOP will retain its majority, who's presiding will change. With Republican Chief Justice Maureen O'Connor over the age limit to run again, voters chose another Republican, Justice Sharon Kennedy, to take her place. On an already conservative panel, \"Justice Kennedy was perhaps the most conservative,\" says Jonathan Entin, a law professor at Case Western Reserve University. Kennedy, a former police officer and administrative judge, has been on the bench since 2012. In 2017, she spoke at an event held by an anti-abortion rights group at the same time the panel was hearing a case about whether or not to close an abortion clinic. \"It is morning again at the Ohio Supreme Court,\" Kennedy told supporters assembled at the GOP Election Party in Columbus. Ohio voters also reelected Republican Associate Justices Pat Fischer and Pat DeWine, son of Gov. Mike DeWine. Gov. DeWine, also a Republican, will get to appoint one justice to the court, filling O'Connor's seat. When it comes to redistricting, Ohioans approved two constitutional amendments, in 2015 and 2018, to update the process of carving up districts so that it would be more bipartisan and less likely to favor one political party over another. However, Republican officials continued to control the map-drawing process. As a result, O'Connor, the outgoing chief justice, sided with Democrats and tossed out proposed maps for unfairly advantaging Republicans \u2013 five times. With the new bench, GOP lawmakers may get those maps after all. \"It's pretty clear that elected officials, at least the Republican elected officials, have been waiting out the court,\" says Entin. Power over redistricting is just one example of the influence state supreme courts wield. These maps not only determine which party controls the state legislature, but also how many Democrats and Republicans the states are likely to send to Congress. With slim margins in the U.S. House of Representatives, \"these courts have significant power, especially at this moment, to determine how our federal government is functioning, not just the state government,\" says Douglas Keith, counsel with the Brennan Center for Justice. Between Ohio and North Carolina, 29 congressional districts are in play. The Brennan Center is representing some of the plaintiffs in Ohio's redistricting litigation. At the same time, races to control these courts have attracted greater spending, and in some cases, have become more explicitly partisan. For example, this midterm Ohio voters saw a \"D\" or \"R\" next to a justice candidate's name on the ballot, thanks to a 2021 law passed by the GOP-led legislature. Funding has also swelled. State judicial races used to be \"pretty sleepy,\" says Keith, attracting donations primarily from interest groups within the state. In recent years, there has been a growth in campaign funding from national political groups and PACs. The Republican State Leadership Committee credits the \"clean sweep\" in Ohio and North Carolina to the group's judicial campaign spending effort, called the Judicial Fairness Initiative. The Initiative's goal is to \"ensure that the redistricting fights ahead in those states are ruled on by strong conservatives,\" said an RSLC spokesperson in a statement. Democrats, Republicans, and PACs spent big in Illinois, where Democrats managed to secure open seats and maintain their majority on the court. Accounting isn't final for the 2022 races, but some states have already broken their previous records this cycle, says Keith. During the 2020 election, state supreme court contests drew $97 million, making that the most expensive cycle to date, according to a Brennan Center report.

Republicans flipped control of the state Supreme Court into their favor. North Carolina saw the biggest state supreme court flip of the midterms, switching from a 4-3 Democratic majority, to a 5-2 Republican one. Once they are seated, this new bench could hear cases on the state's voting district maps, as well as education funding and abortion rights. The vast majority of these decisions have no partisan angle, says former North Carolina state Supreme Court Justice Bob Edmunds, a Republican. In recent years, though, shifts outside and within the court have made it more overtly politicized. \"This year, the [North Carolina] justices in some of their writings were accusing each other of making decisions on the basis of political affiliation,\" says Edmunds, adding that is \"not usual.\" A fight over partisan gerrymandering in the state is ongoing. North Carolina must redraw its congressional map before 2024. Edmunds is a special master, or an outside expert called on by the court, in redistricting matters. But beyond that, the justices could significantly shake up the state's voting requirements, he says. North Carolina has several cases related to voting access winding their way through state and federal courts, such as N.C. NAACP v. Moore. Edmunds says that changing when, how and where people vote, \"hits home in a way you wouldn't necessarily expect, because it's so fundamental to how we perceive ourselves as American voters.\" Andy Chow, of the Ohio Statehouse News Bureau, contributed to this story.",

ATLANTA \u2013 For many Democrats, Georgia has come to symbolize the party's future. But after one of its brightest stars, Stacey Abrams, lost her second bid for governor last week by a roughly 7-point margin, Democrats are beginning to dissect what happened up and down the ballot. The question is not only pressing for future Democratic campaigns in one of the country's newest swing states, but it's important right now. Sen. Raphael Warnock, the only statewide Democrat who remained standing on Election Night, still has to win a Dec. 6 runoff with Republican Herschel Walker. \"Could it be that [Abrams' campaign] was too insular, saying let's just run the same playbook from four years ago and that's going to work?\" asks Tammy Greer, a professor of political science at Clark Atlanta University. Unlike 2018, the White House is now occupied by a Democrat, President Joe Biden, whose approval ratings have sagged in Georgia, partly because of inflation. On the campaign trail, Gov. Brian Kemp constantly emphasized his handling of the state's economy, from reopening businesses and schools early in the pandemic to pausing the state gas tax amid rising prices. \"Gov. Kemp being an incumbent was going to be difficult to beat,\" says Democratic strategist Tharon Johnson. \"He ran a very disciplined campaign. His message was really succinct. I can repeat it because he kept saying it over and over.\" That economic-focused message may have helped Kemp win some of the independent and Republican-leaning voters who also voted Democratic for Senate. Warnock has been making specific appeals to split ticket voters in the runoff, boosted by some voters' discomfort with Walker. But demographer and Democratic strategist Fred Hicks says Georgia's overall turnout rate also fell from 2018. \"It wasn't that you saw a whole bunch of Democrats in the [Atlanta] metro area come out and vote for Brian Kemp, but they did not come out and vote,\" he says. Specifically, Georgia's Black and Hispanic turnout rate dropped from the last midterms, while the turnout rate for white and Asian American voters improved. That's according to an analysis of state voter history by Bernard Fraga, a professor of political science at Emory University. Historically, Black voters in particular have formed a core part of the Democratic coalition in Georgia. It's too early to know exactly why turnout lagged. Some Democratic operatives complain that Abrams' message was muddled, that voters were turned off by her national profile or that the top of the ticket didn't deploy its resources efficiently. Abrams' campaign and her leadership committee raised well over $100 million for her bid. But Greer believes Democrats didn't do enough direct voter outreach this election, like phone calls and door knocks. That could affect the Senate runoff election, when the candidates have to get voters back to the polls in a very short window. Warnock's campaign is hiring an additional 300 paid staffers and says they will knock on more doors during the 4-week runoff than the entire general election campaign. The Republican-aligned Senate Leadership Fund has meanwhile inked a deal to deploy Kemp's turnout operation to get out the vote for Walker. Greer says Democrats, who in recent cycles gained significant ground in Georgia by engaging new and irregular voters, assumed that Georgia's growing and diversifying population would help carry them more than it did. \"There was a complete hubris to the demographic shift,\" she says. \"Huge hubris.\" In 2018, Abrams came within a 1.4 point margin of becoming the country's first Black woman governor. Last cycle, Georgia elected a Democrat for president for the first time since 1992 and sent two Democratic senators to Washington, delivering the party control of the chamber. But when Abrams ran again four years later, she lost by an even greater margin \u2013 about 7.5%. \"We may not have made it to the finish line, but we ran that race,\" Abrams told her supporters on Election Night. Democrat Jen Jordan's unsuccessful campaign for attorney general had the narrowest margin of any Democrat beside Warnock. Her team has been closing up campaign headquarters, packing up signs and organizing supplies into neatly-labeled boxes. Like Abrams, Jordan talked about abortion rights on the campaign trail. But Jordan made it the centerpiece of her campaign. Kemp signed a restrictive abortion law in 2019 banning most abortions after about six weeks. Jordan's Republican opponent, incumbent Attorney General Chris Carr, has fought to uphold the law in court. Jordan says that focused message did move the needle \u2013 just not enough to counter other dynamics at play. \"I don't think that the really negative impact of the law has kind of bubbled to the surface yet,\" she says. \"I think there was kind of a disconnect, right?\" Nationwide, voters rejected GOP candidates who were endorsed by former President Donald Trump and embraced his false claims about election fraud. In Georgia, Democrats found it difficult to paint their opponents as extremists on democracy. Kemp and Georgia's Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger became known for refusing Trump's demands to help overturn the 2020 election result in Georgia. \"While in other states, Republicans were very involved in all of the things that were happening and loud and proud about their connections to Trump, really the opposite was happening here,\" Jordan says. As Democrats regroup, some also wonder what the losses mean for the party's bench. Abrams has been seen as a top talent, but she's now lost twice statewide. The Abrams campaign didn't respond to a request for comment. Lis Smith, a Democratic operative and top staffer on Pete Buttigieg's unsuccessful presidential campaign, says building Democratic power can take many forms, like Abrams' decade-long project to make Georgia competitive. \"There are many different avenues where these talented people, like Stacey Abrams, Tim Ryan in Ohio, Beto O'Rourke in Texas, can direct their energy and we need to stop acting like holding elected office is the only thing that matters in politics,\" Smith says. But before looking too far ahead, Democrats and Republicans alike say they are focused on the task in front of them \u2013 the Senate runoff election next month.",

            "article_content": "For many Democrats, Georgia symbolizes the party's future. But former Representative Stacey Abrams just lost her bid for governor, and Democrats are starting to dissect what happened.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: For many Democrats, Georgia has come to symbolize the party's future. But last week one of its brightest stars, Stacey Abrams, lost her second bid for governor against Republican incumbent Brian Kemp. Only one statewide Democrat remained standing on election night, Senator Raphael Warnock. And he still has to win a runoff against Republican Herschel Walker. Now Democrats are starting to dissect what happened with that key race still looming. WABE's Sam Gringlas reports from Atlanta. SAM GRINGLAS, BYLINE: In 2018, Stacey Abrams narrowly lost her bid to become the first Black woman governor in the country, no less in a state that had been dominated by Republicans. Four years later, Abrams came up short again against Republican Brian Kemp. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) STACEY ABRAMS: We may not have made it to the finish line, but we ran that race. GRINGLAS: But this year, the Abrams campaign lost by a much bigger margin, more than seven points compared to just over 1% last time. TAMMY GREER: Could it be that perhaps it was too insular? Let's just run the same playbook from four years ago, and that's going to work. GRINGLAS: That's Tammy Greer, a political science professor at Clark Atlanta University. Unlike 2018, the White House is now occupied by a Democrat. And President Biden's popularity has sagged in Georgia, partly because of inflation. Kemp constantly emphasized his handling of the state's economy from reopening businesses early in the pandemic to pausing the state gas tax amid rising prices. THARON JOHNSON: Governor Kemp being an incumbent was going to be very difficult to beat. GRINGLAS: Tharon Johnson is a Democratic strategist. JOHNSON: He ran a very disciplined campaign. His message was very succinct. I can repeat it because he kept saying it over and over. GRINGLAS: Kemp's focus on economics may have helped win some independent voters, but demographer Fred Hicks says the turnout rate also dropped from 2018. FRED HICKS: You know, it wasn't that you saw a whole bunch of Democrats in the metro area vote for Brian Kemp, but they did not come out and vote. GRINGLAS: The Black and Hispanic turnout rate fell from the last midterms. It's too early to know exactly why, but Professor Greer thinks Democrats didn't do enough direct voter contact. She believes they assumed Georgia's growing diversity would carry them more than it did. GREER: There was a complete hubris to the demographic shift, huge hubris. GRINGLAS: The Democrat who got closest to winning beside Warnock was Jen Jordan. She was the nominee for attorney general. This week her team's been closing up campaign headquarters. JEN JORDAN: Signs are getting packed up. We've got the whiteboard that was kind of all the messaging and strategic stuff that's been wiped clean. GRINGLAS: Like Abrams, Jordan talked a lot about abortion rights, but Jordan made it the centerpiece of her campaign. She says it did move the needle, just not enough. JORDAN: I don't think that the really negative impact of the law has really kind of bubbled to the surface yet. I think there was kind of a disconnect, right? GRINGLAS: And in Georgia, it was harder for Democrats to paint their opponents as extremists on democracy. In fact, the incumbents here, like Kemp and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, expressly refused Trump's demands to overturn the 2020 election. GREER: While other states' Republicans were very involved and were loud and proud in terms of their connections to Trump, really, the opposite was happening here. GRINGLAS: As Democrats regroup, some also wonder what the losses mean for the party's bench. Abrams has been seen as a top talent, but she's now lost twice statewide. The Abrams campaign didn't respond to a request for comment. Lis Smith, a top staffer on Pete Buttigieg's presidential campaign, says building Democratic power can take many forms, like Abrams' decade-long project to make Georgia competitive. LIS SMITH: There are many different avenues where these talented people like Stacey Abrams, Beto O'Rourke in Texas can direct their energy. And we need to stop acting like holding elected office is the only thing that matters in politics. GRINGLAS: For now, Democrats and Republicans say they're focused on the Senate runoff next month.

            "article_content": "NPR's Ailsa Chang talks with two recently elected transgender lawmakers, Representative Zooey Zephyr of Montana, and Representative James Roesener of New Hampshire.  AILSA CHANG, HOST: For the first time in U.S. history, this election season, at least one LGBTQ candidate has run for office in every state and Washington, D.C. And that has led to a number of other firsts, including the first out trans man ever elected to a state legislature, James Roesener of New Hampshire, and the election victory of Zooey Zephyr, the first out trans lawmaker elected to office in Montana. All of this at a time when legislation targeting the rights of LGBTQ people is being drafted and passed all around the country. Here today are James Roesener and Zooey Zephyr. Welcome and congratulations. ZOOEY ZEPHYR: Yeah. Thank you so much for having us. Excited to be here. JAMES ROESENER: Hello. Thank you so much. CHANG: So I want to first just start by asking you what inspired both of you to run for office this election cycle? Like, why now in particular? ZEPHYR: This is Zooey Zephyr. In 2021 in Montana, there were several anti-LGBTQ bills brought forward. And I had been working on policy at the city level and went to testify at the legislature specifically on a bill banning trans women and trans kids from playing sports. I then went and testified to the governor's office alongside two trans kids who were begging to just be allowed to play sports with their friends. And then I watched several bills pass through the Montana legislature by one vote. And I thought to myself I could change that heart. I know representation can make that difference. And so I met with my legislator at the time and asked him, what do I need to do? And he gave me a list, and off I went. CHANG: So Zooey, your path into politics - it started in activism. What about you, James? ROESENER: Very much same here. I have been part of the LGBT community and advocacy for a while. I have volunteered for going on eight years now at the local clinic that not only provides, like, gender-affirming services and LGBT health care but also is an abortion clinic as well. And they're kind of a second family to me at this point. I've been seeing them for so long. Not just do I care about these issues, but then it becomes personal a little bit when, you know, laws are threatening to lock up my friends for providing very necessary health care and health services to my community. It just feels a little absurd and surreal. Understanding the weight that local politics has, especially for communities like mine, I really felt it was important to have some visibility of our own, let alone having somebody who's willing to fight the good fight regardless of identity. CHANG: Well, let me ask you because, you know, right-wing politicians and even some in the mainstream GOP have been targeting trans people. Like, the newly reelected governor in Iowa, Kim Reynolds, she ran a campaign ad this cycle saying that Iowans know the difference between boys from girls. What do you make of the fact that this kind of rhetoric has been so prevalent from Republican politicians, people who will very likely become some of your colleagues? ZEPHYR: The first thing I think of is the direct impact it has on trans people and those who love them. When Montana passed its anti-trans legislation, I had friends leave the state. I had friends end their lives. And that is the immediate impact of these types of bills. Beyond that, to me, the - it is a short-term strategy on the right to drum up fear, to find a target that they think is vulnerable, that they can rally their base around. What I think the right will find is that when you take away the R and the D and you bring it down to our local communities, trans people have the support of those around them. And in Montana, when the Department of Public Health and Human Services proposed a new rule about banning updating your birth certificate if you're trans, they held a public hearing, and one person came out to support that anti-trans piece of legislation and 100 came out in opposition to it. And that's across Montana. And if it's true here, I know it's true across the country as well. ROESENER: People are very willing to show up and defend the rights of their neighbors. And that's been a lot of what my experience in this campaign has been is seeing in real time what I already believed was in people kind of organize for a better world. CHANG: Well, despite there being a fair amount of legislation out there that you find deeply hurtful, deeply disturbing, there has been a record number of LGBTQ candidates running for office during these midterms. And I just want to know, what does that signal to both of you? ROESENER: I feel like to see so many LGBT people being inspired to run just proves to me that all of this homophobic and transphobic and bigoted rhetoric that's been flowing in our system for, you know, a little bit now, we are taking our power back, in a sense. And I think that we're going to see a really amazing turning point in the near future here. ZEPHYR: The first thing it signals is that we have people in our community who are willing to stand up and put themselves out there. That would have been hard to imagine decades ago that this many people would stand up and want to be visible and present. And beyond that, with the record number of people winning, it shows that our communities don't just passively support us. My friends and neighbors in my district looked at me and said, that's the person we want representing us. And I know that that's true for all of the candidates across the country who won their elections. CHANG: So what will be your first priorities in office? ROESENER: New Hampshire recently has experienced its first abortion ban. It's a 24-week ban with no exceptions for rape or incest. One of my first priorities moving into this next session is going to be to work to enshrine the right to abortion and reproductive services into our state because we are the only state in New England that does not have those protections in place. ZEPHYR: The state of Montana is currently sitting on a $2 billion surplus, and both Democrats and Republicans have been putting forward plans for what to do with that. Top priorities in that and top priorities in my community and across the state are affordable housing and making sure that we have enough inventory for Montana's population. Additionally, there's big discussions around mental health in the state of Montana. My job will be to help with that. And also when it comes to human rights, make sure that we're having conversations around the way in which these anti-LGBTQ attacks, the way in which attacks on abortion, the direct impacts they have on the mental health crisis we're trying to solve. CHANG: State legislators-elect Zooey Zephyr of Montana and James Roesener of New Hampshire. Thank you, and congratulations to both of you. ZEPHYR: Thank you so much for having us. ROESENER: Thank you much. Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.  All rights reserved.  Visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.

            "article_content": "Democrats have won the Senate, and Republicans continue to close in on winning the House. This raises questions about just what's next in Washington.  MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: A week after Election Day, we now finally have a clearer picture of what the next Congress will look like. Republicans at this hour are one seat short of picking up a majority in the House. They are on track to do so, but their majority would be very slim. And Democrats will again control the Senate. So to look at where things stand, we bring in NPR senior political editor and correspondent Domenico Montanaro. Hey there. DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Hello, Mary Louise. KELLY: This means, among other things, divided government come January again. Tell me what you're watching for. MONTANARO: Well, it's going to be really hard for anyone to get a lot done. I mean, Republicans are only probably going to have a three- or four-seat majority, and that's going to mean a giant headache for Kevin McCarthy or whoever winds up being speaker of the House. You know, Democrats holding the Senate, on the other hand - important to them, they can block any conservative piece of legislation. They can continue to appoint federal judges. And, you know, importantly, if a Supreme Court nomination comes open, they'll be able to fill that vacancy that we saw - really important with the court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade in the spotlight, of course, this year. And they can stop any potential Biden administration impeachments if any come their way. But there's - you know, that's not a whole heck of a lot. You know, Democrats won't be able to get much done on their own, certainly. The filibuster is still there, and anything they pass isn't going to get through the Republican-controlled House. And we know compromise for a lot of Republicans in the House is a dirty word. KELLY: So that's the state of play. With the election now a week behind us, what are the major lessons, big takeaways you have identified from these midterms? MONTANARO: Yeah, I mean, I think a really big one is - you know, the key message was that people don't want extremes. You know, undoubtedly abortion rights was also a major factor. It can't be overlooked. It was a key motivator for a lot of voters. And I think those two things are related. You know, big majorities said the Supreme Court had gone too far with their overturning of Roe v. Wade. And there were lots of Trump-backed candidates up and down the ballot who bought into Trump's lies about the 2020 election and lost in competitive places. A lot of them, though, did something Trump still hasn't done. Let's take a listen. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE) DOUG MASTRIANO: Josh Shapiro will be our next governor, and I ask everyone to give him the opportunity and to pray that he makes the decisions that are beneficial for the state and not necessarily for his party. DON BOLDUC: Maggie Hassan has won. I was told the protocol was to call her first. But I'm not one for protocol. MONTANARO: So first there you heard Doug Mastriano, the Republican Pennsylvania gubernatorial candidate who lost, and a reluctant concession there from Don Bolduc in New Hampshire, who ran for that Senate seat on the Republican side, but a concession nonetheless. KELLY: Yeah. MONTANARO: And the fact is, if you were to hear that exit polls would show inflation to be the top issue, Republicans would be more trusted to handle that and that 73% of the electorate would be white, you wouldn't be blamed if you thought that this was going to be a Republican wave here. Without a doubt, though, it was these Trump candidates or candidates viewed as too extreme in competitive districts who cost Republicans in the House and the Senate. KELLY: I mean, stay with the Trump candidates because Trump did lean in on a bunch of races. He made big endorsements, especially in battleground states. It did not turn out as he might have thought it would. MONTANARO: No. And he endorsed people up and down the ballot, from governors to senators to even Staten Island borough president, you know? And that helped many of these candidates get through GOP primaries, even boosted them. But in general, elections in purple states and swing districts - so many of them lost. It's just a different ballgame. In those decisive Senate races, his candidates in Pennsylvania, Arizona, Nevada all lost. His candidate in Georgia was trailing the Democrat and is now headed for a runoff next month. And in the House, looking at the numbers, his candidates faired pretty terribly in competitive races. Our intern, Katherine Schwartz, put together a list of races that the Cook Political Report rated lean or toss-up. There were 64 of them Trump endorsed. In 21 of those, only seven won. It was even worse if you zoom in and look at the most competitive races. In just the toss-ups, only one of Trump's candidates has won. The numbers really just speak for themselves. And yet tonight Trump appears to be ready to launch another presidential run despite the evidence that his brand and style of politics continues just not to be very popular in purple states. KELLY: So what do you make, Domenico, of the timing? Why is he making this announcement now? MONTANARO: It really is coming from a place of weakness. You know, he wants to try and clear the field and force Republican elected officials to get off the sidelines and endorse him. He doesn't want to give any more oxygen, by the way, to someone like Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who a lot of Republicans are looking at as the future, a sort of cultural Trump candidate without all the chaos and drama - no doubt there's a reckoning coming here. KELLY: Domenico Montanaro, thank you. MONTANARO: You got it. Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Democrats delivered an upset to Republicans over the weekend, clinching a victory in the Nevada Senate race in order to maintain their narrow control of the chamber for at least the next two years. Election victories, like those of incumbent Sens. Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada and Mark Kelly of Arizona, were fueled in part by young voters, including on college campuses in key battleground states, where students organized and campaigned to get other young voters to the polls on Nov. 8. \"I think myself and others really felt that this time, that, like, this is kind of a make or break moment,\" said Central Michigan University senior Katie Ellison. \"Overall, I think it was a little bit surprising, right,\" Ellison said. \"The red wave that wasn't.\" Early estimates suggest that midterm turnout among people under 30 was the second highest it's been in three decades, outpaced only by 2018 \u2014 the election after Donald Trump's 2016 presidential win. \"I'm just filled with a really big sense of pride and fulfillment that our turnout numbers are high, and that young people \u2013 especially in Michigan, but all over the country \u2013 are really turning out, showing out and speaking their voices really loudly about how they want this country to look,\" Ellison said. About 27% of eligible Americans between the ages of 18-29 cast a ballot this year, according to early estimates from the Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement (CIRCLE) at Tufts University. While this is still comparatively lower than other generational groups, the youth vote did not drop off, as Democrats had feared would happen. The youth voters' share of the electorate was 12%, similar to what it's been in past elections. They also voted for Democrats in slightly lower margins this year than in 2018. But turnout in competitive swing states, the research found, was even higher at about 31% \u2013 the same rate of youth turnout in the watermark 2018 election. \"Outreach, contact, investment in these states was higher,\" said CIRCLE deputy director Abby Kiesa. \"So it's not surprising that voter turnout is higher in these states.\" Student voters interviewed by NPR organized voter registration drives, lobbied for polling locations on campus and helped educate fellow students on their right to vote. Their efforts were funded by the nonpartisan MTV Campus Vote Challenge 2022. \"A lot of us are just uneducated on what to do to actually get to the polls,\" said Emory University graduate student Mickel Sandifer. \"And then, you have the accessibility barrier, you know some people don't have vehicles or access to shuttles.\" Research conducted by students at the Duke University Master in Interdisciplinary Data Science program found that in 2020, 76% of colleges did not have in-person Election Day voting options, and 74% of colleges had no in-person voting options at all. Sandifer was part of a group of students who helped organize to get ballot boxes on the Emory University campus. \"If you've got a precinct on campus, not only does that serve the school, but they also serve the nearby community and households and families that are within the area,\" Sandifer said. Youth voters said they were motivated by issues including gun control, student debt, climate change and the abortion debate, which both Democrats and Republicans had made a banner issue after the repeal of Roe v. Wade. \"I feel like, especially given the overturning of Roe v. Wade, I think that made a lot of people who are less reactionary to politics to be very upset by this,\" said 19-year-old Emory University junior Sofia Damer-Salas. Historically, midterm elections see the incumbent president's party lose a number of seats in both the House and the Senate. This year, Democrats managed to buck that trend by maintaining their narrow lead in the Senate. According to CIRCLE, young people preferred Democratic candidates by a 28-point margin, a further referendum to Republicans who have long struggled to court younger, more diverse supporters. Issues on which Democrats and Republicans are most split usually find Democratic support among younger Americans. And on social media sites generally geared towards young people, Democrats have more readily engaged on these platforms, opening up their recognizability to potential young voters. Isaiah Hinzman, a 19-year-old Eastern Arizona College sophomore, said, \"There are a lot of people who expected that young voters were still not going to vote because they didn't believe it was as important. But this midterm election proved that young voters do care about what is happening around in this country, and they voted for their future.\"",

How will the midterm election results shape the two parties and their agendas moving forward?  LEILA FADEL, HOST: Despite most projections, Democrats will go into the next Congress in control of the Senate. Their candidates won in pivotal races in Arizona and Nevada over the weekend. A MART\u00cdNEZ, HOST: Control of the House remains in the balance. Though, Republicans are on track to win a narrow majority. FADEL: NPR senior political editor and correspondent Domenico Montanaro joins us now. Good morning, Domenico. DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Hey. Good morning. FADEL: So the Senate was always expected to be close. But Democrats have held onto it despite historic trends where the party in power does badly. And now they could even end up with a narrow majority if they win the runoff in Georgia next month. How did this happen? MONTANARO: Yeah. I mean, a few things. And I think they're intertwined, you know, abortion rights, extreme, Trump-endorsed Republican candidates who lost in big numbers across the country, in swing states and districts, and good candidates from Democrats who held up. Clearly, abortion rights were a huge motivator for voters on not just the left, but also in the center and on the center-right. FADEL: Yeah. MONTANARO: It showed up big time in exit polls. It was even the top issue for voters in Pennsylvania overall. More than 60% of voters in key battleground states said they think abortion should be legal in all or most cases. And in Arizona, 40% of voters said they were angry about the overturning of Roe. And anger, we know, really motivates voters to get to the polls. FADEL: Yeah. MONTANARO: What the Supreme Court did was clearly seen among voters as too far. And the message overall with abortion and these more hard-right candidates is that people just don't want extremes. FADEL: What about young voters? There have been assessments that suggest it was young voters that made the difference for the Democrats. Is that what happened? MONTANARO: I think a lot of groups can make that claim. That was based on, really, one early assessment by Tufts University that found that young voters turned out at about a 27% rate. And if that holds, it would be the second-largest share that we've seen for young voters in quite some time and just short of their record in 2018. But that's only 27%. And it's lower than the share for almost every other generational group. FADEL: OK. MONTANARO: And it meant that because so many more groups did turnout at high levels that younger voters' share of the electorate was still only about 12%, which is what it's been in past elections. And when it comes to the margins, they actually voted less for Democrats now than in 2018. And when looking at a couple of key counties where young voters make up a big percentage - say, Dane County in Wisconsin, where the University of Wisconsin is, and Center County in Pennsylvania, where Penn State is - those counties went for Democrats, actually, by smaller margins than they did in 2018. You know, that said, I think that we can at least say that younger voters did not fall off and turnout in lower numbers, as Democrats had feared before the election. And they certainly were part of a coalition that helped Democrats stave off a red wave. FADEL: What does Democrats holding the Senate mean for the next two years of Biden's agenda? MONTANARO: I mean, it's hugely important for Biden, you know? Biden can now continue to reshape the federal courts, which would have been completely stopped. You know, and if a Supreme Court vacancy comes up, Biden would still have the power to appoint one. Although, one isn't expected in the next two years. But in light of the Dobbs decision, that's a pretty key presidential power to hold on to. You know, and Biden can likely keep the cap on his veto pen, maintaining the majority will certainly constrain Republicans' ability to pass unified legislation that they would send to Biden. FADEL: Now, control of the House still up for grabs. Where do things stand there? MONTANARO: It is. Republicans are on track for a narrow majority at this hour, just six seats away from taking the majority, 19 races uncalled. But that would be a really small majority, looking like only a few seats that Republicans could lose to pass legislation. And we know there's a hard-right faction in the House who's going to want a lot from a potential speaker Kevin McCarthy or whoever winds up being speaker. FADEL: NPR's Domenico Montanaro.

            "article_content": "President Biden and China's leader are meeting at the G20 summit. Democrats retain control of the U.S. Senate. Turkish authorities say at least six people were killed in a blast on an Istanbul street.  LEILA FADEL, HOST: Men leading two of the most powerful countries in the world meet in person today. A MART\u00cdNEZ, HOST: Yeah, it's President Biden and China's leader, Xi Jinping. They're sitting down for a face-to-face chat in Bali, Indonesia, on the sidelines of the G-20 summit there. It's their first meeting since Biden became president. And it comes as the relationship between the two superpowers is starting to look more and more like a Cold War. FADEL: NPR's Emily Feng is in Bali and joins us now. Thanks for being here, Emily. EMILY FENG, BYLINE: Hey. Good morning. FADEL: Good morning. So this meeting has started between Biden and Xi. And it's the most anticipated agenda item at G-20. And like A just said, they're meeting at quite a low point in the U.S.-China relationship. So tell us what they hope to achieve. FENG: Right. This is a high-stakes meeting because the core of what they can achieve is, given their two countries' disagreements, can the U.S. and China still find any way to work together? Is there still anything they can agree on? And it's not an over-exaggeration to say this could be a real turning point in the relationship because, as you mentioned, the U.S.-China bilateral relationship is increasingly looking like a Cold War standoff. You have the U.S. imposing tech sanctions on semiconductor technology that will cripple certain sectors in China. And then they're facing off on all manners of things, like human rights, on trade, on Taiwan. And their militaries are building up to counter each other. So this meeting is feeling a bit like a Hail Mary. They're trying to save what's remaining in this relationship. FADEL: So what's on the agenda? FENG: There's a lot of big-ticket items. There's, of course, the war in Ukraine. China has tried to remain neutral on that. The U.S. is also going to push China to try to rein in North Korean missile tests. But overall, this meeting is about the U.S. and China - Biden saying he does not want the U.S. to go into conflict with China. And he's really been playing up the fact that he knows Xi Jinping probably better than official right now because the two men used to meet frequently for days at a time when they were both vice presidents. But a lot has changed since then. And the biggest issue which has changed is Taiwan because, as early as last month, Xi Jinping said he was not ruling out a military invasion to take control of the island. And at the same time, you have the U.S. stepping up its support for Taiwan. So that's a potentially combustible situation. FADEL: So is there hope for a real solution to this increasingly strained relationship? FENG: Biden is hoping that he can set a floor in the relationship. But expectations are very, very, very low. This meeting, according to White House advisers, is really more about setting guardrails rather than meeting specific outcomes. FADEL: OK. FENG: And this gets to the heart of why the U.S.-China dynamic has not improved and, unfortunately, likely won't improve in the near future, because the Americans are focusing on continuing to communicate, keeping these lines of communication open. Whereas what China wants are these firm commitments to political positions the U.S. has already indicated are just not negotiable. For example, last year, China's foreign minister put out three core demands. They wanted the U.S. to not hinder China's development, to respect Chinese claims to places like Taiwan and to not interfere with China's political system. But 16 months on, there's really been no progress in all three of these items. So it's hard to see how the two countries can meaningfully work together when they're so fundamentally at odds with each other. FADEL: Yeah. NPR's Emily Feng in Indonesia. Thank you so much. FENG: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) FADEL: Despite most projections, Democrats will go into the next Congress in control of the Senate. Their candidates won in pivotal races in Arizona and Nevada over the weekend. MART\u00cdNEZ: The thing is, though, control of the House remains in the balance. Though, Republicans are on track to win a narrow majority. FADEL: NPR senior political editor and correspondent Domenico Montanaro is with us. Good morning, Domenico. DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Hey. Good morning. FADEL: So the Senate was always expected to be close. But Democrats have held onto it despite historic trends where the party in power does badly. And now they could even end up with a narrow majority if they win the runoff in Georgia next month. How did this happen? MONTANARO: Yeah. I mean, a few things. And I think they're intertwined, you know, abortion rights, extreme, Trump-endorsed Republican candidates who lost in big numbers across the country, in swing states and districts - you know, and good candidates from Democrats who held up. You know, clearly, abortion rights were a huge motivator for voters on not just the left, but also in the center and on the center-right. FADEL: Yeah. MONTANARO: It showed up big time in exit polls. It was even the top issue for voters in Pennsylvania overall. More than 60% of voters in key battleground states said they think abortion should be legal in all or most cases. And in Arizona, 40% of voters said they were angry about the overturning of Roe. And anger, we know, really motivates voters to get to the polls. FADEL: Yeah. MONTANARO: What the Supreme Court did was clearly seen among voters as too far. And the message overall with abortion and these kind of more hard-right candidates is that people just don't want extremes. FADEL: People don't want extremes. What about young voters? There have been assessments that suggest it was young voters that made the difference for the Democrats. Is that what happened? MONTANARO: I think a lot of groups can make that claim. That was based on, really, one early assessment by Tufts University that found that young voters turned out at about a 27% rate.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) FADEL: In Turkey, officials are calling an explosion Sunday in Istanbul that killed at least six people and wounded at least 80 more a terrorist attack. MART\u00cdNEZ: The blast happened on the city's most popular commercial street where crowds of people shop and watch street performers. FADEL: NPR's Peter Kenyon is following the story and joins us from Istanbul. Hi, Peter. PETER KENYON, BYLINE: Hi, Leila. FADEL: So Peter, what's the latest on this attack? KENYON: Well, there is one person in custody who's suspected of having had a direct role in the bombing. Turkey's interior minister, Suleyman Soylu, told reporters that the person who police believe left the bomb on the crowded street and walked away had been taken into custody. Police also say some 46 others are being held for questioning. The bomber was identified as a woman, Ahlam Albashir, who police say is a Syrian national. But Interior Minister Soylu also had some pretty harsh words for countries who he says harbor terrorists or allow them to raise money. He also identified the group Turkey believes was behind the bombing. Here's a bit of what he said. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) SULEYMAN SOYLU: (Non-English language spoken). KENYON: Now, what he's saying here, he's basically calling out, quote, \"the insincerity of our so-called allies\" - those are his words - who he says either hide terrorists in their country or send them money from their own treasuries. He named the United States, saying a condolence message from Washington was like, quote, \"a killer being first to show up at a crime scene.\" Turkey has also accused Sweden of supporting terror groups. Soylu named the PKK, the Kurdistan Workers' Party, and especially its Syrian affiliate, the PYD, as being behind the attack. Turkish security forces have been battling PKK militants and their allies for decades here in Turkey, northern Iraq, also in Syria. FADEL: Now, you've been speaking to people who were there when the explosion happened. KENYON: That's right. FADEL: What did they tell you? KENYON: Well, a number of the people didn't want to talk right away. They were just too upset. They had to get home, they said. But I did meet 60-year-old shop owner Hasan Ozsut. Now, he runs a small dairy farm. He sells his products from two small shops. He said he's pretty sure the blast occurred very close to one of his shops. He's expecting to find blown out windows and other damage. But he hasn't been able to get there yet because of the crush of ambulances, police and firefighters descending on the scene. He's not sure when he'll be able to assess the damage. He did tell me, though, that now he'd gotten over the initial shock. He'd started to reflect on what this will mean going forward. And he says, it's not good. Here's some of what he told me. HASAN OZSUT: This is just happening to Turkey's, you know, future, which is coming very near to at the end of the year. So the people are going to be doing, you know, Christmas shopping. People are going to come over here, you know, do some Christmas tourism. This is actually a bomb to Turkish economy. KENYON: And he also said he wishes Turkey's government would stop being quite so proud of its military prowess, selling drones, and do a bit more to focus on its own citizens and their needs. FADEL: Where do things go from here? KENYON: People think this is another blow to Turkey's efforts to find its economic footing. There's basically a sense of harder times ahead, with the government now consumed with security matters. FADEL: NPR's Peter Kenyon in Istanbul. Thank you so much. KENYON: Thanks, Leila.

Catherine Cortez Masto is seen Monday. The Democrat defeated Adam Laxalt, a Trump-backed Republican and former Nevada attorney general. The win means Democrats retain the U.S. Senate. Despite some very tight races, Democrats have held on to their slim majority in the U.S. Senate. The chamber was decided Saturday evening after Nevada Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto defeated Republican nominee Adam Laxalt, a former state attorney general, according to a race call by The Associated Press. That gives Democrats 50 Senate seats, which is enough for the majority with Vice President Harris' tiebreaking vote. The U.S. House remains up for grabs, with Republicans maintaining a narrow inside track to the majority. Nevada was one of Republicans' top targets, and Cortez Masto's reelection was a toss-up coming into the election. She was running neck and neck with Laxalt, Nevada's former attorney general who was endorsed by former President Donald Trump. As of the AP race call, Cortez Masto had a lead of about 5,000 votes. Democrats could add to their margin in the Senate, if incumbent Raphael Warnock defeats Republican challenger Herschel Walker in a runoff in Georgia on Dec. 6. Another factor that played a role in Democrats' defending their majorities is the issue of abortion rights. After the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June, researchers saw a distinct increase in voter registration among women and young people. While national polls indicated that the economy and inflation were top of mind, there's no doubt that the issue of abortion rights played a crucial role in motivating voters and increasing fundraising for Democratic candidates. In an interview with NPR's Weekend Edition Sunday, Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., said it had been \"a great week for democracy\" and attributed her party's success to strong candidates \"who had experience, who knew how to get things done.\" \"[T]he reason there wasn't a red wave is because Democrats had a 'blue wave of accomplishment' and we basically defied the tides of history,\" she said, quoting Senate Majority leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. So what do Democrats understand that voters have asked them to do? Klobuchar said the party's mandate was first, to bring down costs, including pharmaceuticals, protect Social Security and  Medicare, and \"do all we can to get our economy in a place that works for everyone.\" Second, she says, is to codify Roe v. Wade. \"We don't know what's going to happen with the House ... We don't know if the Republicans will play ball. I'd get rid of the filibuster to do it.\" And third is to protect democracy. \"A lot of the election deniers lost,\" Klobuchar noted. \"So it shows Americans care about democracy.\" If Republicans take the House, it's unlikely the two chambers will find much common ground and the dynamic tees up some clashes over government funding bills and increasing the debt ceiling. A Democratic hold of the House would mean President Biden's party would maintain its trifecta of power for another two years. In the Senate, questions of whether to modify the filibuster will likely also take center stage, as Democrats still remain short of a 60-vote supermajority and would need to bypass the filibuster if they want to pass major legislative priorities. A secure Democratic majority in the Senate also preserves Democrats' ability to approve Biden's nominees, including any future vacancies on the U.S. Supreme Court. Earlier this cycle, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell predicted there was a \"greater likelihood the House flips than the Senate,\" citing, in part, \"candidate quality.\" The effect that former president Donald Trump had on his party's fortunes is under scrutiny, as many of his hand-selected candidates lost. Liam Donovan is a former GOP campaign strategist, now with lobbying firm Bracewell LLP. He told NPR's Ayesha Roscoe that the Republican establishment is now \"rethink[ing] whether he is a net positive in this party going forward. Now, do the voters agree? That question remains unsettled.\" Trump's involvement affected which candidates decided to enter races nationwide \u2013 with many that did eventually losing in the general election in races considered winnable by Republicans. \"Republicans lost the Senate in 2010 and 2012 because they put up poor candidates,\" says Donovan. \"The difference [in 2022] is that President Trump, I think, locked these fields into questionable candidates. You had people that might have been the strongest staying out because they didn't want to go anywhere near this. You had a number of strong governors who might have come in and easily won these seats that stayed out.\" Trump, he says, is \"somebody that people don't necessarily want to grapple with.\"",

            "article_content": "NPR's Scott Simon talks with Democratic Congresswoman Abigail Spanberger about what her tough reelection in Virginia means for her and her party in the future.  SCOTT SIMON, HOST: Going to turn now to Representative Abigail Spanberger. The Virginia Democrat and former CIA officer won reelection in a race that was considered a toss-up. She defeated Yesli Vega, an anti-abortion rights candidate with a law enforcement background and the support of former President Trump. Congresswoman Abigail Spanberger joins us now. Thank you so much for being with us. ABIGAIL SPANBERGER: Thank you very much for having me. SIMON: This was a tough and closely watched campaign for everybody, I suppose. What were the issues, as you heard it from your constituents, that seemed most important? SPANBERGER: So it really varied person to person. One of the things I would characterize, though, is that across the board there was just a level of uneasiness or a level of concern that existed. So for some people the uneasiness was because of the gas prices or the cost of prescription drugs or the cost of, you know, food at the grocery store. For some people it was the concerns about a loss of freedoms with the Dobbs decision and, you know, concern about what might come next. SIMON: Let me ask you about something President Biden said this week. He was asked at a press conference about voter frustration, as expressed in exit polls and other information and what he intended to do differently over the next two years. Let's listen to his answer. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Nothing, because they're just finding out what we're doing. The more they know about what we're doing, the more support there is. SIMON: Do you agree with that approach? SPANBERGER: Well, I think there's always area for improvement in ensuring that people know what it is that we're working on, what it is that we've delivered. We can always do better at connecting those dots, taking a moment to say, let me connect the dots between these sets of concerns that this community, this state, you know, these individuals have with the work that we've actually been doing. SIMON: Such a bitter campaign in so many districts, including - I don't have to tell you - your own. Can you work with the people in the other party on the Republican side after such a campaign? SPANBERGER: You know, I can. I have had three really tough campaigns. And at the end of the day, the work that I do is about serving the people that I represent, you know, whether they voted for me or not. Hyperpartisanship and division and anger is bad for the country. And I have always, since I got to Congress, been focused on trying to bridge some of these divides. SIMON: Does that put you at least somewhat at odds with people who are progressives in your party? SPANBERGER: Well, I think that the idea's that, you know, the bigger the coalition, the better. And so if I believe in these policies, I should take the time to try and - not always successfully, but try and pitch these ideas to people across the political spectrum and at least, you know, have the conversation. This is what I'm advocating for. SIMON: But to point out the obvious, you have been outspoken in saying that you were concerned that some progressive Democrats were advocating policies that you didn't think were going to help the party, particularly when it comes to defunding local police and questions like that. SPANBERGER: Yeah. Well, I think important piece there is that, you know, with the exception of a couple of people, no one was actually advocating for taking funding away from police. And so my point is, if someone is going to use this, you know, hashtag on Twitter or hold up a poster at an event and then say on Capitol Hill, well, what I really mean by that is - then what are you doing? You're mixing up a message, confusing people. You know, the word defund has an actual literal definition, and people are believing you when you say that. And if you don't mean it, don't say it. SIMON: Do you hope President Biden runs for reelection? SPANBERGER: You know, I think that we need to continue to make the case of the things that we are doing on behalf of the American people. And I think that we need to continue to advocate for strong voices in support of and defense of our democracy, our institutions. So we need to continue as legislators just kind of focusing on what matters to people. And so, you know, whether it's the current president or, you know, any future Democratic leaders, you know, that's what I'm focused on. SIMON: It's irresistible to point out you answered our question without once mentioning President Biden by name. SPANBERGER: That was supposed - evidently not intentional, but, yeah. I - you know, and I - you know, I'm focused on the people that I represent, and I brought President Biden to our district. And I had the opportunity to put constituents who were struggling with the price of their prescription drugs in front of the president of the United States. And, you know, that was last year. And then fast forward - we passed the Inflation Reduction Act, and many of those same constituents now will see their lives changed. And so I'm proud of the work that I've done with President Biden. I'm proud of the fact that former President Trump signed bills into law of mine. And that's, I think, really what the role of an elected representative should be, is focusing on solving problems, not necessarily the sort of palace intrigue of who's doing what when, but really just getting things done for the American people. SIMON: Representative Abigail Spanberger, Democrat of Virginia, thanks so much for being with us. SPANBERGER: Thank you so much for having me. Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.  All rights reserved.

RENO, Nev. \u2013 Republican Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo will serve as Nevada's next governor, pushing out Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak, according to a race call from the Associated Press. Loading... Sisolak is the only incumbent governor (so far) to lose reelection in 2022. Key issues in the race were crime, abortion and the economy. In 2018, he was elected the first Democratic governor in the state in more than two decades. Former President Donald Trump endorsed Lombardo, who says he disagrees with Trump that there was fraud in the 2020 election. Lombardo is an army veteran who began as a police officer at the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department in 1988 and was elected as sheriff in 2014. Lombardo became a national name during the mass shooting in Las Vegas in 2017. He supports school-choice vouchers, which would allow parents to use state money for private-school education. Opponents argue that would take resources from public schools. Nevada ranks low nationally for student achievement. Democrats have criticized Lombardo for shifting stances on several issues. He previously said he supported a 13-week abortion ban, but later said that decision should be up to Nevada voters. Abortions are guaranteed up to 24 weeks under state law. Lombardo has rallied with Trump twice but disagrees that there was widespread voter fraud in 2020. Lombardo also implemented a COVID-19 vaccine requirement for new Metro Police hires, but walked that back. Economically, Nevada was hit hard by the pandemic, but casinos are now seeing record-breaking revenues. The state still has one of the highest unemployment rates. Lombardo has promised to not raise taxes and wants to see a diversification of Nevada's economy away from tourism through manufacturing jobs. More Election 2022 coverage:",

Susie Lee has won reelection in Nevada's 3rd Congressional District, beating her challenger, Republican April Becker, in one of the most competitive House seats this cycle. Lee's seat was considered vulnerable after the Democratic-led state legislature in Nevada redrew the district last year, adding more Republican voters. Lee raised a record amount of money, more than $5 million, and far outspent Becker. The race also attracted funds from outside groups, and became one of the most expensive House races in the country. Lee spent most of the campaign attacking Becker's stance on abortion, and Becker shot back by aligning Lee with President Biden and his record on the economy. She also went after Lee when a Mother Jones report said Lee could financially benefit from legislation she wrote. In the final stretch of the campaign, Democrats sent in former President Barack Obama to Las Vegas to rally voters, where he slammed Republicans for giving tax breaks to the wealthy. Lee was first elected to Congress in 2018 to replace Rep. Jacky Rosen, who won her race for Senate that year. Loading...",

Titus out-fundraised her opponent throughout the cycle, but outside groups like the Congressional Leadership Fund, which is affiliated with House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, spent millions on the race.

Tony Evers at The Orpheum Theater on Nov. 8 in Madison, Wisc. Evers defeated Republican challenger Tim Michels Tuesday. Who leads your state's government shapes daily life in the United States. These governors and legislatures make policy on guns, abortion, education and the environment. Combined with gridlock at the federal level, \"where you live now increasingly determines what policies you live under,\" said Thad Kousser, professor of political science at UC San Diego. In the 2022 midterms, Democratic candidates exceeded expectations in state leadership races, winning competitive contests for governor and flipping state legislatures. But Republicans sailed to victory in their strongholds. Here's how the midterms shook up state-level leadership. In the close races, Democratic governors were usually the ones on the defense. Biden's low approval ratings and inflation woes stoked fears of a \"red wave.\" But many Democrats in tighter competitions won reelection: Gov. Janet Mills in Maine, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer in Michigan and Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham in New Mexico. In Wisconsin, Gov. Tony Evers also won a second term. He will continue to work with a state legislature led by Republicans. Gov. Laura Kelly kept the governor's office in Kansas, a state which former President Donald Trump won twice. The party also solidified its control in two states where registered Democrats significantly outnumber Republicans: Maryland and Massachusetts. In both, the Democratic candidate won an open governorship that a Republican had vacated. Democrats now completely control state government in both states. (When one single party controls the state house, state senate and governor's office, it's called a \"trifecta.\")  While state legislatures in both were already able to override vetoes from the outgoing Republicans, it will now be even easier to pass Democratic agenda items with a trifecta. There will also be a Democratic trifecta in Oregon, where Democrat Tina Kotek emerged victorious on Thursday night out of a close race with Republican Christine Drazan. \"We had the best midterms for governors since 1986,\" President Biden told reporters at a press conference this week. Going into the election, Republicans held 28 state gubernatorial offices, and Democrats, 22. That number will change, although final results are pending in a few states. No matter what, the majority of Americans \"will be living in states where Democrats are governors\" in 2023, due to their wins in high-population states, said Ben Williams of the National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL), during a press call. The Republican Party has controlled a majority of state legislatures in the country since 2010. This cycle, two Democratically-aligned outside spending groups put $80 million into beginning to change that, on top of the around $50 million spent by the party itself. Part of the mission was to make sure state legislatures did not work to overturn the results of the next presidential election, as many GOP lawmakers did in 2020. Democrats succeeded beyond their expectations. The party flipped the Michigan state House and the state Senate, a chamber it has not controlled in four decades. That will give Democrats a clear path to enact their agenda items. In her victory speech, Democratic Gov. Whitmer said that would include growing the economy, improving public education, and continuing to \"fight like hell\" to protect fundamental rights. In Pennsylvania, Democrats also claim to have flipped the state House of Representatives, holding a press conference to announce their victory. In that chamber, state Rep. Joanna McClinton could be the first Black woman to become speaker of the Pennsylvania House. The Associated Press has not yet called all of these races, and the state Republican party has not conceded. \"We believe Democrats claiming the majority at this time is premature and we are continuing to closely monitor a number of races where votes are still being counted,\" Pennsylvania House GOP spokesperson Jason Gottesman told NPR. Some of Democrats' success in Michigan and Pennsylvania can likely be attributed to new voting districts maps drawn after the 2020 Census. Democrats also took a supermajority in both chambers of the Vermont state legislature, meaning the party can now override the GOP governor. The night he won reelection, Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis walks onstage during an election night watch party at the Convention Center in Tampa, Fla., on Nov. 8.\n                \n                    \n                    Giorgio Viera/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption The night he won reelection, Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis walks onstage during an election night watch party at the Convention Center in Tampa, Fla., on Nov. 8. Republican governors brushed off challengers, even in races that were thought to be close. In Georgia, Gov. Brian Kemp defeated Democrat Stacy Abrams for the second time, and by a wider margin. In Florida, where Gov. Ron DeSantis narrowly defeated his 2018 opponent, he walloped his 2022 challenger Charlie Crist, winning by a double-digit margin. Gov. Greg Abbott also defeated Beto O'Rourke in Texas, winning a third term. In a much tighter race, Gov. Kevin Stitt of Oklahoma overcame a challenge from state education official Joy Hofmeister. The GOP may still pull off an upset in Nevada, a state that voted for President Joe Biden in 2020. Gov. Steve Sisolak is trailing Las Vegas area sheriff Joe Lombardo, a Republican, in his bid for reelection. The Associated Press has not yet called the race. But in Arizona, where Republican Gov. Doug Ducey is term-limited, the race is too close to call. As of Friday, former local Fox television anchor Kari Lake and Secretary of State Katie Hobbs are still locked into a tight race. Lake, who has made false claims about the integrity of the 2020 election, initially declined to say if she would accept the outcome of her race if she lost. Republicans held or strengthened their trifectas by picking up seats in Florida, the Iowa Senate and South Carolina's House. The party now holds veto-proof majorities in Florida and Ohio. In these states, many conservative policy priorities have already been enacted or proposed, such as permitless gun carrying and restrictions on teaching about gender or sexuality in schools. Growing those majorities, even under Republican gubernatorial leadership, could lead to infighting. \"Just because you wear the same jersey doesn't mean that you are always playing for the same goals,\" said Williams from the NCSL. But the GOP was unable to gain overwhelming majorities in some states with divided governments, which means Democratic governors will still be able to exercise their veto powers. Republicans gained a supermajority in the Wisconsin Senate, but not the Wisconsin House. That's significant because the state's Democratic governor, Tony Evers, survived a close contest to win a second term. During his first, he vetoed more than 140 bills and will continue to be able to veto Republican-passed legislation. The same thing happened in North Carolina. Republicans won a supermajority in the state Senate. But Democrats said they have kept enough seats in the state House to keep the GOP from steamrolling Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper. Divided governments like these are becoming rarer. \"Starting in 2010 and in nearly every election since then, the red states have gotten redder and the blue states have gotten more blue,\" said Kousser, the political scientist.

President Biden is entering a new \u2014 and perhaps more challenging \u2014 phase of his presidency: divided government. Results are not settled, particularly for the Senate. But Republicans appear likely to control the House of Representatives. And that means Biden's ambitious legislative agenda essentially will come to a standstill. Experts say even the most basic acts of governing \u2014 such as passing a budget or raising the debt ceiling to prevent the U.S. from default \u2014 could become a legislative grind in the new Congress. And if the GOP takes control of the Senate, judicial confirmations could crawl to a halt. Regardless of the final tally, Biden has said he's willing to try to find consensus across the aisle. \"I'm prepared to work with my Republican colleagues,\" he told reporters the day after the election. \"The American people have made clear, I think, that they expect Republicans to be prepared to work with me as well.\" Biden said he sees the close margins as an opportunity for leverage. \"There's always enough people on the other team \u2014 whether it's Democrat or Republican \u2014 that the opposite party can make an appeal to and maybe pick them off to get the help,\" he said. But there's skepticism about the prospects for White House compromise in a Congress that's become increasingly polarized. \"Of course, they should always talk about things that would tangibly improve people's lives and secure their rights, but it's really hard to see where that's real,\" said Mari Urbina, managing director with the progressive organization Indivisible.

Biden has said he plans to invite leaders from both parties to the White House later this year to discuss how they might work together. But he didn't make clear what those potential areas of consensus could be. The president has previously spoken about opioids, cancer, mental health and veterans issues as a \"unity agenda\" where Republicans and Democrats might find common ground. Biden also recently expressed hopes for a continued bipartisan approach to Russia's war in Ukraine, though in recent months, some Republicans have begun voicing concerns over the large sums of money being given to the Ukrainian government.

Tom Emmer claps as House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy arrives to speak at a watch party after the midterm elections. Biden was more explicit about areas where he will not compromise. He said he will veto any attempts to create a federal abortion ban, or to repeal the Inflation Reduction Act \u2014 the signature climate and health care bill Democrats passed this summer. He has also said he won't accept major cuts or changes to Social Security or Medicare, a proposal put forth by Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee. Some Democrats see a messaging upside to this potential legislative stalemate. With divided government, \"his conversation with the American public gets a lot easier in some ways, politically,\" said Faiz Shakir, a longtime adviser to Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. \"You can say, 'This is what I want to do. This is the agenda I want to pass. And I got Republicans here in the House standing in my way.' \" In other words, the contrast becomes easier than it's been these last two years when Democrats controlled the House and the Senate, but fought about policy amongst themselves.

With legislation stalled, the president is more likely to try to advance his domestic policy using executive actions, much like his predecessors who have dealt with split government. Biden is also more likely to turn his focus to foreign policy, where presidents have more executive power to begin with. Late Thursday, Biden left for a series of summits overseas, featuring a face-to-face meeting with China's President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the G-20 in Bali. Navigating competition with China and managing the war in Ukraine are two key diplomatic priorities for this White House that will continue to be pressing issues after the midterms. Republican plans to repeal the Inflation Reduction Act are largely symbolic, given Biden's veto powers. But they could try to squeeze the president on their priorities by refusing to raise the debt ceiling unless he agrees to some of their initiatives. But there is risk in overreaching, said Brendan Buck, who worked for House Speakers John Boehner and Paul Ryan. \"It's very easy for every new majority that comes in to think that the election was about them \u2014 when in most cases, when a Congress gets kicked out, it's because people just didn't like what the other party was doing. It's not necessarily a validation of the new party,\" Buck said. Going too far risks backlash from voters in the next general election. \"That's what we saw in 2010 into 2012,\" Buck explained. In the 2010 midterms, Republicans gained a whopping 63 seats in the House, only to see then-President Barack Obama win reelection two years later.

Even with a lean majority in the House, Republicans could become a consistent thorn in the Biden administration's side using their oversight powers. As NPR's Susan Davis has outlined, the GOP plans investigations on topic ranging from the Afghanistan withdrawal to the origins of COVID-19. Some Republicans have also been eager to investigate the business dealings of Hunter Biden, the president's son. \"It's payback,\" said Bill Galston, a former domestic policy adviser in the Clinton White House who now serves a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. \"They are very angry about the investigations to which they believe they've been subjected.\" Biden has brushed off the threat of investigations, including threats of impeachment. \"I think the American people will look at all of that for what it is.  It's just almost comedy,\" he said this week. \"I can't control what they're going to do. All I can do is continue to try to make life better for the American people.\" President Biden and first lady Jill Biden walk toward Marine One on the South Lawn of the White House on Nov. 7.\n                \n                    \n                    Samuel Corum/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption President Biden and first lady Jill Biden walk toward Marine One on the South Lawn of the White House on Nov. 7. Biden has faced questions about whether he should run for a second term because of his age and his low approval ratings. Polls show many Democrats are half-hearted about a Biden reelection bid. Democrats stronger-than-expected midterm results could quell internal debate, for the moment. \"This is going to diminish whatever pressure there might have been from within the Democratic party for President Biden to stand down in favor of a fresh face,\" said Galston. \"If there had really been a rout, I think that there would have been a lot of behind-the-scenes pressure that might have burst out into public view sooner rather than later. I don't think that's going to happen now,\" he said. Biden said this week that he hopes to make a firm decision by early next year. \"My intention is that I run again. But I'm a great respecter of fate,\" he said. \"And this is, ultimately, a family decision.\"",

            "article_content": "NPR's Elissa Nadworny talks with Tampa Bay Times Political Editor Emily Mahoney about how Florida, the nation's one-time biggest swing state, has turned redder this midterm season.  ELISSA NADWORNY, HOST: Let's turn now to the whole of Florida, where Governor Ron DeSantis was reelected by a margin of nearly 20 points. Incumbent Senator Marco Rubio also won by double digits, and Republicans will soon have a supermajority in the state legislature. At least this year, what was once a swing state turned quite red. Here to talk about this shift is Tampa Bay Times political editor Emily Mahoney. Welcome back to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. EMILY MAHONEY: Thanks so much for having me. NADWORNY: So only 537 votes famously separated George W. Bush from Al Gore in Florida in 2000. What has happened in Florida since then? MAHONEY: Well, the state has obviously changed a lot. A lot has changed from that famous moment in 2000. And I think that change happened slowly at first. But Republicans have been working for a long time in Florida to, first off, increase the number of Republicans who are registered in the state of Florida. And we saw recently Republicans surpass Democrats in terms of their voter registration numbers recently for the first time in state history. So I think that we can't really overstate how big of a shift that is just in terms of raw numbers. And then I was talking to a high-ranking Republican about the results, and he said that, you know, this kind of represented a candle, and Governor Ron DeSantis poured gasoline on that candle. He has really drawn a lot of attention to the state as sort of a Republican-led - I think he calls it an oasis of freedom during the pandemic and has, you know, most likely caused more Republicans to move to the state of Florida as well and really sort of accelerated that transformation that was already happening. NADWORNY: Were there any regions that normally vote for Democrats that swung towards Republicans in this election? MAHONEY: Absolutely, yes. Miami-Dade County, which is the largest county in the state, went red this time for the first time in two decades, as did Palm Beach County, which was really not something that even the most sort of enthusiastic Republicans that I had talked to before election night - nobody had predicted that. NADWORNY: The red wave that some expected didn't really materialize nationally, but it did in Florida. Why is Florida so different? MAHONEY: Exactly. Well, you have to ask, what is different about the state of Florida? And I think, you know, Governor DeSantis really has to be part of that conversation. He really has made the state sort of the focal point of the Republican Party nationally. But the other thing is also that, nationally, Democrats sort of gave up on Florida this cycle and chose to spend their money elsewhere. And, you know, you can argue whether or not that was a correct strategy, but they did obviously have victories elsewhere. But their margins in Florida were just - the losses are so gigantic, in part because the Democratic candidates there received very little support from national donors and really faced a massive fundraising disadvantage. So they weren't really able to get their message out there. And finally, Hurricane Ian also sort of, I think, sort of put the nail in the coffin of some of the top Democratic candidates. It really sort of kind of minimized the discussion of issues like abortion, where they tend to poll higher, and gave DeSantis sort of uninhibited air time looking gubernatorial very shortly before Election Day. NADWORNY: We just heard from Maxwell Frost. Do you think Florida's Democrats have an opportunity to take back some votes? MAHONEY: Well, his optimism is definitely something that Democrats need an injection of right now. There's a lot of kind of despondency, frankly, within the Democratic Party in the state because of the numbers that we've seen. And so it's really going to take people like Frost with energy and with that kind of optimistic spirit, I think, to sort of perhaps pull them out of what is actually a new low for the party in the state in terms of numbers. NADWORNY: Yeah. Emily Mahoney of the Tampa Bay Times, thank you for your reporting. MAHONEY: Thanks so much. (SOUNDBITE OF MAHALIA SONG, \"IN THE CLUB\") Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.

Voters approved the amendment protecting abortion rights.\n                \n                    \n                    Brandon Bell/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Sandra Bucciero and her son Luke canvass for Proposal 3 last weekend in Dearborn, Mich. Voters approved the amendment protecting abortion rights. Abortion rights supporters had a successful run of ballot measures this year. In every state where voters were asked to weigh in directly on abortion rights, they supported measures that protect those rights and rejected initiatives that could threaten them. Those victories have abortion rights advocates looking at where they can next take the fight directly to voters. \"Let's take this show on the road. Let's go to states, and let's prove that we can win in some challenging environment,\" said Anthony Romero, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union.  \"Let's put this to the people.\" Romero, who spent election night in Michigan celebrating the passage of an amendment to protect abortion rights in the state's constitution, said his group is looking at several states as potential targets for future ballot campaigns, including Ohio and Florida. Kelly Hall, executive director of the Fairness Project, which advocates for progressive-leaning ballot measures, said her organization is also exploring options in those states, along with Missouri, Oklahoma, Arkansas and South Dakota. She said gerrymandering in many states has resulted in lawmakers who support much deeper abortion restrictions than their constituents do. Hall said the initiative process can serve as a check on overreach by state lawmakers \u2014 when there's a \"huge gap between the desires of the electorate and the actions of politicians. And nowhere is that more the case in America right now than on abortion rights.\" Loading... Faced with these political losses, anti-abortion rights groups are emphasizing that they were outspent by their opponents in these campaigns. and they say they believe that voters were misled by some of the messaging around these initiatives. Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of SBA Pro-Life America, told reporters on Wednesday that she's concerned more states will try to pass pro-abortion-rights ballot measures like those in California. Dannenfelser argued that it's often better for abortion laws to be made by elected officials after a robust public debate. \"It is the biggest concern that we have in the pro-life movement \u2013 that we gain our advantage that we find through candidates debating the issue \u2013 where we don't have that advantage when we're outspent 10 to 1 in a referendum,\" she said. \"It is a serious problem.\" The group's vice president of state affairs, Stephen Billy, said he believes abortion rights supporters want to \"use the courts to try to take the issue out of voters' hands\" by challenging anti-abortion laws in state court, and \"use ballot initiatives as a way to thwart the legislative process.\" Advocates for bans on most abortions \u2013 including a wave of state laws passed in recent years that prohibit the procedure within the first several weeks \u2013 are at odds with public opinion, according to many years of polling. While most Americans support some restrictions on abortion, most support access earlier in pregnancy. That's even the case in some deeply red states like Texas, where since 2021, when a unique state law took effect, residents have been seeing the impact of a ban on most abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy. In August, voters in Kansas rejected a push for an amendment that would have said the state's constitution contains no right to an abortion.\n                \n                    \n                    Kyle Rivas/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption In August, voters in Kansas rejected a push for an amendment that would have said the state's constitution contains no right to an abortion. Romero, with the ACLU, said recent votes for abortion rights in red states show that many Republican-leaning voters are willing to cross party lines to push back against laws they see as overly restrictive. He accuses Republican elected officials in many states of \"pandering to the most extreme portion of their base ... that's holding Republican voters and the broader public hostage.\" \"You have to leapfrog the governors, and you have the leapfrog the legislatures,\" Romero said. Victories for abortion rights supporters this week in Kentucky and Montana followed a similarly successful fight in Kansas in August. Many states lack a process for citizen-initiated ballot initiatives, leaving the question of abortion in the hands of their state lawmakers. According to the Fairness Project, such initiatives are possible in 22 states. Even in those states, such efforts could face pushback from abortion opponents. Michigan's initiative survived Republican-led challenges aimed at keeping the measure off the ballot, including objections to the formatting and spacing of the language in the amendment. Kentucky Right to Life Executive Director Addia Wuchner displays a brochure urging voters to support Amendment 2, which would have stated that the state constitution contains no abortion protections.\n                \n                    \n                    Stefani Reynolds/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Kentucky Right to Life Executive Director Addia Wuchner displays a brochure urging voters to support Amendment 2, which would have stated that the state constitution contains no abortion protections. Hall, with the Fairness Project, acknowledges there's a risk that abortion rights advocates might overplay their hand by putting the issue on the ballot and possibly galvanizing voters who will elect anti-abortion candidates. But she said she believes that well-crafted measures, tailored to the specific concerns of voters in individual states, can gain bipartisan support. \"These need to be strategic decisions that meet the electorate where it is,\" Hall said. \"I don't think though that we should shy away from having these deep, strategic conversations even in the reddest of places \u2014 because frankly there are no other options left in many states for how we advocate for people who need reproductive healthcare.\" NYU law professor Melissa Murray said she believes there's a robust appetite among many voters to push back against some of the state restrictions that have taken effect in recent months, though the specific message and rationale will vary from state to state. \"California may have a different logic for this than Kansas, where the prospect of government encroachment might seem like the antithesis of conservatism,\" Murray said. \"But it's all cashing out in the same way. Where voters have direct access to the ballot box to register their preferences on abortion, they are registering them in ways that make clear that there is ... appetite for greater protections for reproductive rights.\"",

Scott Applewhite/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption The Capitol is seen as Congress resumes following a break for the midterm elections on Nov. 14. Republicans seemed to have everything going for them. They only needed to flip five seats. And yet, it took much longer for the House to be called in Republicans' favor than either party was expecting. And, while they will have the majority, Republicans are likely to wind up with a far smaller one than they were hoping for. So what happened? It's not as if there was a massive issue-area shift from pre- to post-election. Exit polls showed inflation was the top issue overall and Republicans were far-more trusted to handle the issue than Democrats. And the electorate was whiter than in past elections, reversing a decades-long trend of whites shrinking as a share of the electorate in midterms. The two things are related in that it showed voters rejected extremes. The exit polls also showed big majorities of voters, for example, thought the Supreme Court went too far in overturning Roe. In Pennsylvania, abortion came in as the top issue. In Arizona, 40% of voters said they were angry about the Supreme Court's decision \u2014 and anger is a huge motivator. There were so many close races that the extreme Trump-backed candidates likely made the difference between the slim majority Republicans are likely to attain and something much larger \u2014 and in the range prognosticators were expecting. He was able to boost many of these candidates through GOP primaries. But an overwhelming number of them lost in general elections in purple states and swing districts. And yet the former president, who has fomented distrust in U.S. elections with baseless conspiracies and who inspired the deadly Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol in an attempt to hold onto power, announced another run for president Tuesday night. Loading... As it stands: That means, Republicans would only be able to lose four votes to pass legislation out of the House starting in January. That could be a major headache for Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif. \u2014 or whomever becomes the Republican speaker \u2014 and leaves them vulnerable to losing the House in two years. And though he's wounded by these midterm losses, Trump remains the favorite for the Republican presidential nomination, though less of a sure bet. It's quite the box for Republican elected officials. They will be in charge of maintaining a fragile House majority that would likely have been bigger without election-denying candidates on the ballot and was attained in spite of a leader who craves being the center of attention and whose brand has repeatedly proven toxic in general elections in competitive states and districts. But Trump's popularity and influence with the base is going to make separating \"Trump\" from \"Republican\" difficult for the party in the near future. That's especially true when he controls so much of the party apparatus nationally and at a state level \u2014 unless Republican voters overwhelmingly conclude that Trump is largely to blame for the midterm losses and are convinced he gives them a worse chance at winning the presidency than, say, a Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. To see just how close races are, check out our graphic that shows the margins in each of the remaining uncalled House races. Representatives-elect during a group photograph outside the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday. Congressional Republicans returned to Washington this week adrift and questioning their party's leadership after falling far short of expectations in the midterm elections.\n                \n                    \n                    Al Drago/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Representatives-elect during a group photograph outside the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday. Congressional Republicans returned to Washington this week adrift and questioning their party's leadership after falling far short of expectations in the midterm elections. Republicans look like a 222-213 majority is the most likely outcome when all the votes are finally tallied. Rep. Lauren Boebert's races in Colorado's 3rd congressional district is headed for an automatic recount because just 554 votes out of more than 327,000 cast separate Boebert from her Democratic opponent Adam Frisch, a former Aspen city councilman. Frisch has already coneded to Boebert saying there's very little chance the outcome will change. Frisch has already filed to run again in 2024. Republicans also continue to lead in California's 13th and 22nd districts, both Democratic-held. If somehow the final vote turned either of those races around, Democrats could pick up another seat, but the vast majority of vote is in in both. Reported vote continues to trickle in slowly in California, which has been commonplace in every recent election. The state takes longer to count its mail votes. Alaska's 1st congressional district is headed to a ranked-choice voting retabulation and will be decided Wednesday. Democrats hold that seat currently and are favored to hold onto it. Here's the list of uncalled races and who leads in them (as of Friday at 1:04 p.m. ET): It's notable how well incumbents did in these general elections. Democrats picked up a seat this week in the 3rd Congressional District in Washington state, a district that had been held by a Republican, Jamie Herrera Beutler. But she voted for former President Trump's impeachment and was ousted by the right in the primary. There's an irony in the fact that she was ousted because she voted to impeach Trump and, now, a Democrat has taken over that seat. It's indicative of the broader message in this election. Note: Please keep in mind that these numbers are fluid and will change as votes continue to roll in. See the latest results here. (The two independents caucus with the Democrats.) With their wins the last two days in Arizona and Nevada, as well as their flip of the Pennsylvania seat, Democrats will retain the Senate. It's a remarkable accomplishment for Democrats with a president whose approval rating has been below 50% for more than a year. But base energy over the issue of abortion and a slew of Trump-backed candidates, who failed in purple states, proved to thwart a potential Republican Senate takeover. Alaska: This has been added to the Republican total even though the race is not settled yet, because both leading candidates are Republicans, so this will stay in GOP hands. The question is at this point: which Republican. Incumbent Lisa Murkowski (R) trails Kelly Tshibaka (R) by less than 2 percentage points, or just under 3,000 votes, with 80% in. If neither candidate gets above 50%, this goes to a ranked-choice re-tabulation Nov. 23. Murkowski would likely be favored to win that. Loading... Georgia: Incumbent Raphael Warnock (D) and Republican challenger Herschel Walker (R) are headed to a runoff because neither surpassed 50% on the ballot. Warnock missed the threshold by just under 23,000 votes. Democrats have the chance to expand their Senate majority with a win there. Loading... Nevada: Democratic incumbent Catherine Cortez Masto took the lead after a batch of votes Saturday night were reported in Clark County. Shortly thereafter, she was declared the winner, clinching Senate control for Democrats. There is still vote to count in Nevada, which we will monitor, including 15,000 provisional votes from Clark County, which could also help Cortez Masto extend her lead. Arizona: Democratic incumbent Mark Kelly's lead expanded by about 8,000 votes with the Friday night batch of about 80,000 votes out of Maricopa County. The race was called in his favor quickly after that, though vote counting continues there, and there is a closely watched governor's race, where Democrat Katie Hobbs currently leads Trump-backed Kari Lake, who has made unfounded allegations of fraud in the election.",

Critics say that infanticide is already illegal and the proposed amendment was unnecessary. Loading... If LR-131, a legislative referendum for the Born Alive Infant Protection Act, had passed, medical professionals who did not \"take medically appropriate and reasonable actions\" could have faced punishments of up to $50,000 in fines and up to 20 years in prison. The measure declared that an embryo or fetus is a legal person with a right to medical care if born prematurely or survives an attempted abortion, among other birth scenarios. Members of the medical community opposed the amendment saying it represents government overreach in decisions made between a patient and provider. They say in instances where a baby is born early or with fetal anomalies, doctors will be forced to perform painful and unnecessary procedures that will keep the family from spending the final moments with their infant. Republican proponents of the initiative said it was morally necessary to protect babies that survive an attempted abortion even though instances of this occurring are rare. In 2002 a federal law granted infants born alive the same rights as persons but did not mandate care or include penalties. Eighteen states have passed similar laws. Abortion continues to be legal in Montana. The state's constitution protects it under its right to privacy. More Election 2022 coverage",

            "article_content": "NPR's Elissa Nadworny talks with Governing Magazine reporter Alan Greenblatt about Democrats defying the odds in state legislatures like Michigan and Minnesota, where they flipped three chambers.  ELISSA NADWORNY, HOST: Midterm elections are usually bad for the president's party, but last night held some surprises at the state level. Democrats flipped the House and Senate in Michigan's legislature, and Minnesota's Senate also turned blue. Reporter Alan Greenblatt has been following state legislatures for Governing magazine. He joins me now. Welcome to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. ALAN GREENBLATT: Hi. Thanks for having me on. NADWORNY: So as I said, Michigan and Minnesota are the big upsets. Can you tell us the significance of Democrats gaining control of those state legislatures? GREENBLATT: Well, certainly, in those states, they'll be able to push an agenda that they couldn't have otherwise. In Minnesota, Democrats will want to codify abortion rights, which they couldn't do if Republicans held the state Senate. Democrats in Michigan are talking about repealing that state's right-to-work law, an anti-union law that passed under the last Republican governor that they had. But it's just significant that Democrats won anywhere. Typically, we'd expect the president's party to lose control in legislatures, and instead they won. NADWORNY: Yeah. In your report this morning, you said, quote, \"Democrats have defied history.\" Just how unusual is it for a sitting president's party to win seats in midterms? GREENBLATT: Highly unusual. So if we go back all the way to 1900, there have been 60 midterms - 6-0 midterms. The president's party has gained seats in state legislatures only twice in the last 120 years. Once was 1934, when Republicans were still taking a beating for the Great Depression. And then, 20 years ago, in 2002, George W. Bush was president, and Republicans were still enjoying a great deal of public support following the September 11 terrorist attacks. So it's been 20 years. Typically, on average, the party in the White House loses more than 400 seats nationwide in legislatures during midterms, and it's basically a wash in terms of seats. Republicans still control. They've been dominant at the state level in legislatures ever since 2010. They've had big majorities. They still hold more legislatures than Democrats, but they won no new ground last night. NADWORNY: These historic wins for Democrats on the state level, especially in battleground states like Michigan - what do they tell us about the 2024 presidential election coming up? Like, what do they signal? GREENBLATT: Well, obviously, if you're a Democrat, you're glad that the party did well winning not just legislative seats, but governors races in states like Pennsylvania and Michigan. Arizona, Nevada - some of the other battleground states out West are still - still have not been called. But, you know, it's hopeful for Democrats. And between this - the Democrats keeping legislative control and both Republicans and Democrats who are not election deniers winning secretary of state races in the battleground states, 2024 might be just a bit less combative than we would have predicted, say, a week ago. NADWORNY: How fascinating. And just in the last, you know, 10 seconds, what does all this mean for 2024? GREENBLATT: Well, between now and 2024, states are going to be doing a lot more on policy than Congress. Congress is going to be gridlocked. We're going to have red states and blue states going in totally different directions with passing lots of laws when it comes not only to abortion and things we've been hearing about, but education funding and crime, climate, you name it. NADWORNY: Everything. That was Alan Greenblatt. He's a senior staff writer at Governing magazine. Thanks for joining us. GREENBLATT: Great to be with you. Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.

            "article_content": "With races yet to be decided and the balance of power in Congress up in the air, what are the main lessons to learn from the 2022 midterm elections?  AILSA CHANG, HOST: All right. As we've been hearing, this election is not over yet, but there are still lessons to be learned for Republicans, for Democrats, for everyone in-between. And here with his major takeaways is NPR's senior political editor and correspondent, Domenico Montanaro. Hey, Domenico. DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Hey there. All right. CHANG: So we all know the day after Election Day is upon us, results are still coming in. There are any number of perspectives on what's important to notice right now, especially if you spend a lot of time on social media. But as we've been talking about, elections do have lessons, right? So let's start with that. What lessons should both of these parties take away from this midterm election? MONTANARO: Well, maybe one of the lessons is don't spend too much time on social media. (LAUGHTER) CHANG: That's a lesson for all of us. MONTANARO: Everybody's got their own perspectives and views on what they think was going to happen or could happen or might be happening. You know, we preached patience beforehand. We said that this was the next phase in, really, election season. And that's what's playing out right now. I mean, it was mentioned that some of these races are taking a while. We expected that to be the case. We expected that all of these Senate races would be super close, sort of ignored the polls, frankly, for most months, even though, honestly, the polls were pretty close to being right and certainly within the margin of error in a lot of different places. But clearly, Republicans underperformed in the House. And there's going to be a lot of finger-pointing right now - and there is already at Kevin McCarthy and at former President Trump in particular. CHANG: OK. So we still don't know the balance of power in the Senate. You have been telling all of us for weeks to be patient, to be patient about the results. How much longer do you think we have to be patient? (LAUGHTER) MONTANARO: Your whole life, Ailsa. You know, Arizona, probably we're not going to see real results as a final thing potentially until Friday. Maricopa County, where most of the vote really comes from and where there were some struggles early on in counting and which has been ground zero for a lot of election denialism, is probably not going to be reporting. They may be reporting all of the results by then is when they hope. So, you know, we're looking at least until then. You know, these races are super close. Democrats have one pickup in the Senate with Pennsylvania. That means that it really could come down to Georgia on December 6, depending on the outcomes in Arizona and Nevada, which again, are exceedingly close. And I do think people have to be a little patient with the results in the House. You know, we are certainly seeing Republicans have underperformed what they wanted. But, you know, no one was ever really thinking that there was going to be the chance of a 60-seat change. That was never going to be the case because of how narrow the playing field is. And what we really saw were some candidate quality issues on the Republican side and some really good Democratic incumbents who held off some of those folks and really made a difference. And I really think abortion rights as an issue really was a motivating factor for so many people. That's why the crosscurrents of this election were so volatile for so long. CHANG: Yeah. Well, Domenico, you are our numbers guy. You spend a lot of time poring over data on, you know, about polls, researching about voters. You mentioned that the polls actually turned out to be pretty close to the mark. Can you talk a little bit more about that? How did the polls do? And did anything actually surprise you? MONTANARO: Well, you know, this is one of those things. The narratives kind of get ahead sometimes of the data. And, you know, certainly the narrative was that Republicans were closing the gap or were expanding what could be potentially, you know, much bigger victories. And all of that was certainly possible. But we also had to be prepared for the other scenario where it's not necessarily going to be at that height. You know, right now, it looks like they could win, you know, seats anywhere from eight to a dozen, which would be at the low end of the forecasters' expectations, but not outside the realm of possibility. I think one of the things that we did see - you know, I was talking to one of our pollsters earlier about this - is that the congressional generic ballot, which asks people, who do you want to be in charge of Congress right now, was tied, and that pollsters have actually done a pretty good job in recent years of figuring out - to make that better. And enthusiasm varied state by state, especially in midterm elections. And that's one caveat going forward in other elections. CHANG: That is NPR's Domenico Montanaro. Thank you so much, Domenico.

President Biden cheered Democrats for their better-than-expected performance in the midterm elections and avoiding a \"red wave,\" but with Republicans poised to claim a narrow majority in the House he said he stands ready to work across the aisle. Speaking to reporters from the State Dining Room on Wednesday, Biden said he will invite congressional leaders from both parties to the White House after traveling to the Middle East and Asia later this week. \"I'm prepared to work with my Republican colleagues,\" he said. \"The American people have made clear, I think, that my Republican colleagues be prepared to work with me as well.\" The president also reiterated his intention to seek reelection, saying he will likely make the final decision early next year. \"Our intention is to run again ... regardless of what the outcome of this election was,\" Biden told reporters. He said he hoped to \"sneak away for a week around\" the holidays with the first lady, Jill Biden, and make an announcement after that. Biden's remarks came on the heels of a Democratic midterms performance that has so far defied history. Since World War II, the party out of power has typically gained an average of 28 House seats and two Senate seats in a president's first midterms. Democrats appear on track to defy that precedent. Though Democrats are expected to lose control of the House of Representatives, control of the Senate is still up in the air. Several key Senate races, including those in Nevada and Arizona, remain too close to call. When asked whether the Democrats could keep the House, Biden said there was \"a possibility,\" but acknowledged it would be close. \"Here's what we do know: While the press and the pundits predict[ed] a giant red wave, it didn't happen,\" he said. The president said he is \"ready to compromise with Republicans\" on issues where it makes sense, but didn't provide any specifics. He said he doesn't have \"much occasion\" to talk with House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy \u2014 who on Wednesday announced his candidacy to be the next Speaker of the House \u2014 but that he plans to speak with him \"later today.\" Finding areas of compromise could prove difficult. If Republicans take the House, they are expected to launch investigations into domestic violent extremism; allegations against President Biden's son, Hunter Biden; and the FBI raid on former President Donald Trump's home where agents seized classified documents, which have become the subject of an ongoing legal battle. In response to a question about House Republicans' plans to conduct investigations into both his administration and his family, Biden said: \"Lots of luck in your senior year, as my coach used to say.\" \"I think the American people want us to move on and do the things for them,\" Biden added. The president signaled there are several areas where he would not compromise. \"Under no circumstances,\" he said, would he support proposed cuts to Medicare and Social Security or any attempt to pass a federal abortion ban. Biden added that he would \"ban assault weapons or try like the devil,\" but he is unlikely to have enough congressional support to do that. On the economy, Biden rejected the idea that the economy was close to a recession. \"We're not anywhere near a recession right now,\" he said. \"I think we can have what most economists call a soft landing.\" But, he added, \"I can't guarantee that we're going to be able to get rid of inflation.\" When asked what he would do differently after the midterms when an estimated three-quarters of Americans said the country was moving in the wrong direction, Biden replied: \"Nothing.\" He said Americans were only just beginning to learn and see the results of his policies so far. The president began his remarks be celebrating the midterms as a \"good day ... for democracy.\" \"Our democracy has been tested in recent years but with their votes, the American people have spoken and proven once again, that democracy is who we are,\" he said. Biden said voters \"spoke clearly about their concerns\" about rising costs. \"There's still a lot of people hurting. They're very concerned \u2014 and it's about crime and public safety,\" he said. \"And they sent a clear and unmistakable message that they want to preserve our democracy and protect the right to choose in this country.\" Biden noted there was significant turnout among young people in the election, and said that he called Florida Democrat Maxwell Frost on Tuesday night to congratulate him on his historic win. Frost will be the first member of Generation Z elected to serve in Congress. Biden said he was optimistic for what's to come in the next year of his administration, and spoke about Democrats' achievements thus far, including the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act and the trillion dollar bipartisan infrastructure legislation.",

            "article_content": "Nevada has become a battleground state in the race for control of Congress. But with little to go on the morning after, what can we take away about how the election played out?  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Our colleague, A Mart\u00ednez, is in Las Vegas. Hey there, A. A MART\u00cdNEZ, HOST: Hi, Steve. Yeah, there's still a lot we don't know about the state of the races. Paper ballots are still being counted here. And as of now, Republican Adam Laxalt has a narrow lead over Democratic incumbent Catherine Cortez Masto. Three out of four House races in Nevada appear to favor Democrats, and the outcome could be heavily swayed by working-class and Latino voters in Clark County. And that's home to the Las Vegas Strip, where thousands of workers were laid off during the pandemic, and many are still without a job. NPR's Deepa Shivaram is here with me in chilly, windy Las Vegas. Deepa, so first, get us up to speed on the latest results out of Nevada. What's still unknown? DEEPA SHIVARAM, BYLINE: Hey, good morning. A lot is still unknown, A. Vote counting is still going on, and officials here have been saying that that was going to be the case for weeks now. This is the first midterm election where Nevada has had this volume of mail ballots. The first time was 2020. And basically, everyone got a mail ballot sent to them. Voters here could mail them in or drop them off in-person yesterday on Election Day. And counting those ballots is going to take days. Right now, candidates are saying that it might take the whole week. Governor Steve Sisolak, who is in a tight reelection race against Republican Joe Lombardo, told supporters last night to be patient. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) STEVE SISOLAK: We said it was going to be close, and it is. We ask you to please, please be patient. We need to make sure that every single vote is counted because we need every single vote. SHIVARAM: But I want to emphasize here that this timeline on how long the vote count will take was expected. And this - these races in Nevada for Senate, for governor or secretary of state, some of these House races, like you mentioned - they're all going to be extremely close. And one thing you'll hear out of Nevada in the next few days, in addition to counting the mail ballots, is something called ballot curing. And that's when there could be an irregularity or a missing signature on someone's mail-in ballot, and the election offices here give those people a chance to fix it so their vote can be counted. And since there's so much mail-in voting this year and the races are so tight, we'll be keeping an eye out for that process as well. MART\u00cdNEZ: OK. Now, you've been speaking to voters here. What have they told you about their priorities? SHIVARAM: You know, the interesting thing yesterday is that I heard just about everything from voters in line yesterday - health care costs, gun violence, abortion rights, of course. I even met one Republican voter who told me he voted for all Democrats this year for the first time because he's worried about a peaceful transfer of power. But above all, as we know, economy and inflation - high gas prices here are something that we've been hearing all over the country and especially here in Clark County. The pandemic absolutely wrecked Las Vegas, which really heavily relies on tourism. And that feeling is still really present as people are still recovering. I was driving around Clark County just the past couple of days, and I've seen maybe one gas station where the price of gas was less than $5 a gallon. MART\u00cdNEZ: Yeah. SHIVARAM: And so many people I spoke with yesterday who are Republican and voting Republican said they just need things to change. And this also goes for independent voters, A, which we know, based on what we've seen, are kind of trending more red this year. They see Democrats in charge in Nevada holding on to both of these Senate seats, the governor's seat, these House races, and they just want something to change. They say something have to be - something has to be different. And Republican operatives I spoke with in the state said that they're hammering home that message, basically saying, you know, that voters are having to choose between gas or groceries because that's what they know is very top of mind here. MART\u00cdNEZ: Now, Nevada has become more ethnically diverse in recent years. What are you hearing about how Democrats and Republicans - how they try to court voters of color? SHIVARAM: Yeah. Latino and Asian voters are hugely powerful in this state, and there's been a lot of recent polling that shows that Republicans are making an impression with Latino voters around the country. And that's true here as well. On the other side, organizations like the Culinary Union, a really big union here in Las Vegas in particular, have been really critical for get-out-the-vote efforts, particularly for Democrats in the past. They say that they've knocked on a million doors this year, which is a record for them. But we're still watching, with these numbers coming in and these ballots being counted, to see how Latino voters showed up in this election, and then also with Asian American and Pacific Islander voters, a very booming population here in Nevada. And there's a lot of interest in voting in that community and wanting to get engaged, but historically, not as much outreach from either party. I talked with Eric Jeng, who runs an organization called One APIA Nevada, about this on Monday. ERIC JENG: Some political consultants call them split-ticket voters. But I'm just - for me, when I talk to them - is they're not party loyalists because the party hasn't shown which party that - deserve community's loyalty. MART\u00cdNEZ: All right. That's NPR's Deepa Shivaram in Las Vegas with me here. Thanks, Deepa, a lot. SHIVARAM: Thanks so much. INSKEEP: And when A said a chilly morning in Las Vegas, I did a quick fact check - 50 degrees in Las Vegas - a little bit of desert morning chill there. Yeah, chilly. It's not that chilly, but it's chilly. It's chilly. Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.  All rights reserved.  Visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.

            "article_content": "In Michigan, Democrats flipped the state house. Minnesota is another place where a state chamber flipped: the senate switched from Red to Blue.  RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: OK. We're going to get down to the state level. Going into yesterday's election, the GOP controlled about two-thirds of state legislatures around the country. NPR's Laura Benshoff is here to talk about whether that changed, if at all, and what it means. Hey, Laura. LAURA BENSHOFF, BYLINE: Hello. MARTIN: All right. Any big upsets in these races? BENSHOFF: Yeah. As you said, the GOP had control of about two-thirds of state chambers, and they control a few fewer now. Democrats have picked up houses in a couple states. In Michigan, they flipped both the House and the Senate. This is according to the Democrats in Michigan. And this is a big deal. It's been decades since the Senate chamber there was out of GOP hands. And you'll remember that there's also a Democratic governor, Gretchen Whitmer, in Michigan who just won reelection herself yesterday. And she's been this target of protests over the last few years, people coming to the Capitol when she issued stay-at-home orders. It was very antagonistic. But now with her party in control of the state government, Whitmer is going to have a new environment, where Democrats may actually be able to enact their agenda. That's also the case in Minnesota now. It's another place where a chamber flipped. The Senate there switched from red to blue. So now Democrats control - boom, boom, boom - House, Senate, governorship. On the other side of the coin, the GOP made a play to flip some chambers in its favor in Colorado and Maine. But it doesn't look like that's happened. MARTIN: So slim margins are hard to govern through - right? - if you control the legislature by just a narrow percentage. Let's talk about supermajorities, where a veto-proof majority effectively gets to cancel out the governor. Did we see any of those form or break up this cycle? BENSHOFF: So the GOP was really looking to make one of those happen in Wisconsin. They have a huge advantage there in the state legislature, but they did fall short in the assembly. That's what they call the statehouse in Wisconsin. And that's significant because this is another place where you had a kind of embattled Democratic governor, Tony Evers, who just won again reelection last night. And during his first term, he vetoed more than 140 bills. If a supermajority had been attained there by the GOP, he would have lost the ability to do that. On the other side, Dems won a supermajority in the Vermont state Legislature in both chambers. There is a GOP governor there that they can now override. And a third place where this was sort of in play was in North Carolina. There was the thought that if there was a big enough red wave, Republicans could come through and just steamroll the Democratic governor, Roy Cooper. It does not look like they have made that happen. So he will live to veto again. MARTIN: State legislatures have a lot of control over big issues these days. Abortion has been kicked to the states - and how elections happen. How did these results that we're seeing thus far affect those particular issues? BENSHOFF: You know, those trifectas that I talked about - states where you have the governor, statehouse and state legislature in one party - they can really push through their agenda, whatever that party's agenda is. And so it could be abortion. It could be voting. So, for instance, if North Carolina had gotten a GOP supermajority, they could - we could have seen a change in abortion rights there. In Michigan, the flip side could now happen with the Democrats in power. So what your life and your choices look like - it can be really different depending on where you live in this country. MARTIN: NPR's Laura Benshoff. We appreciate your reporting this morning. Thanks, Laura. BENSHOFF: Thank you, Rachel. (SOUNDBITE OF MOTHER FALCON'S \"WALTZ\") Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.

Follow live updates and election results here. Gas prices got a lot of attention from candidates these midterm elections, but rents and home prices that skyrocketed during the pandemic are a far bigger chunk of people's budgets \u2014 and those increases are fueled by a historic housing shortage. Voters in dozens of cities were asked to approve more spending for affordable housing, and in some places they did so overwhelmingly. Kansas City will aim to fund \"deeply affordable\" housing, as KCUR has explained, with rents as low as $550 to $750 per month. \"There is not a county in this country where a worker earning a minimum wage and working full time can afford a two-bedroom apartment,\" says Tara Raghuveer, an advocate with People's Action and KC Tenants. \"This is no longer a city issue, but it's one that's expanding out to the suburbs and even rural communities.\" Austin's largest-ever housing bond measure also passed handily, just four years after another one that's already been spent. KUT explains that it will help the city repair existing affordable housing, build new homes and buy land for new home construction. In Florida's Palm Beach County, unofficial results showed voters approving $200 million in additional property taxes to encourage developers to build moderately priced homes. The measure's sponsor, Commissioner Mack Bernard, told WLRN that \"our county workers, police officers, firefighters and teachers cannot afford to live here.\" Votes were still being counted on a so-called mansion tax in Los Angeles, which would impose a 4% or higher tax on property sales of more than $5 million. City officials say it could raise $600 million to $1.1 billion a year, according to LAist.com, to pay for tens of thousands of new affordable housing units and help people avoid homelessness. Opponents warned it could drive up rents and deter developers, and neither candidate for mayor supported it. A sweeping statewide Colorado measure appeared close to passing on Wednesday. Proposition 123 would dedicate about 2 percent of income tax revenues for affordable housing \u2014 about six times more than is currently being spent according to CPR.  It calls on cities to fast-track construction and set rents at less than 30% of household income. But while it would not raise taxes, it would cut into a popular program that refunds residents when the state brings in a lot of money. President Biden has proposed a massive investment in housing but it did not survive in Congress. His administration has pushed cities to build more housing, and faster, but the shortage is so deep that experts say it will take years to fill. Higher mortgage rates are starting to curb housing prices. But last week, the National Association of Realtors said the share of first-time homebuyers has fallen to a historic low. NAR analyst Jessica Lautz says those people able to buy are older, more likely to be white, and that many are getting help with a down payment. \"Either using the bank of mom and dad, or they're moving into their parents' home or family member's home before purchasing,\" Lautz says. \"Or perhaps even cashing out stocks, bonds or retirement savings.\"",

RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: Big governor's races last night. The Democrat vying to be governor in the state of Pennsylvania, Josh Shapiro, has won. Tony Evers, a Democrat trying to - trying for reelection in the state of Wisconsin, also came out on top. Brian Kemp won easily in Georgia, defeating gubernatorial candidate Democrat Stacey Abrams.

RICK PLUTA, BYLINE: Oh, it's a pleasure. MARTIN: So Gretchen Whitmer defeats a political newcomer, Tudor Dixon. Tell us about that race. How close was it in the end? PLUTA: You know, it was close, but in the end, not that close, although Dixon has yet to concede. But, you know, Gretchen Whitmer - really, Democrats in Michigan wound up running the table. Not only did Gretchen Whitmer win reelection, but for the first time in 40 years, the legislature will be controlled by Democrats, the first time that triumvirate will be in place. And it even made a difference in some critical congressional races. MARTIN: I want to ask about this amendment on abortion that Michigan voters approved of yesterday. What does it do? PLUTA: It puts into the state constitution reproductive rights. And it's fairly sweeping in its protections that a lot of it will probably be determined in court cases.

(CHEERING) MARTIN: Governor Whitmer speaking there. So actual voting was on the ballot, too, right, Rick? Voters supported big changes to the electoral system. Explain that. PLUTA: It was a voting rights amendment that dealt a lot with absentee ballots, the ability to get them and to sign up to be permanently on an absentee ballot list, that there has to be drop boxes to be able to vote absentee. And same-day registration is now guaranteed, although it is already in state law. MARTIN: What's your big takeaway from the vote in Michigan yesterday? I mean, does it - does the state still operate as a swing state? PLUTA: I mean, it'll take a couple of elections to determine whether or not Michigan is still a swing state or has become a blue state. I would say it's still a swing state, but it's a lot bluer than it was before. MARTIN: Rick Pluta with Michigan Public Radio Network, thanks for your time. PLUTA: Thank you.

James Roesener has just become the first out trans man to win election to a state legislature in U.S. history, according to the LGBTQ Victory Fund \u2014 a political action committee dedicated to increasing the number of openly LGBTQ public officials in the U.S. Roesener won the race for New Hampshire's 22nd state House District, Ward 8, the group said. The 26-year-old Democrat, who identifies as bisexual and lives in Concord with his wife and cat, says in his biography that he's never been afraid to stand up for what he believes in. \"I believe that it is imperative that all individuals have the ability to thrive in New Hampshire,\" he writes. \"We need a leadership that is invested in defending the freedom all people by taking away barriers to shelter, education, healthcare, voting, and other basic necessities for a quality life.\" Roesener spoke with member station NHPR at a reproductive rights rally in July, after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. He said that decision, as well as the wave of anti-LGTBQ legislation sweeping across the country, affects more than just the people who seek abortion and gender-affirming care. \"It criminalizes and reduces access to everyone, for those who utilize contraception, those who need hormone replacement therapy \u2014 that is not just transgender people \u2014 and those whose well-being relies on medications deemed abortifacients,\" he said. Citing New Hampshire nonprofit Citizens Count, Them reports that Roesener's opponent, Dennis Soucy, supports \"Don't Say Gay\"-style laws and bans on \"teaching certain concepts related to race,\" and has said that police brutality was \"not an issue in New Hampshire.\" Former Houston mayor Annise Parker, the current president & CEO of the Victory Fund, said in a statement that Roesener is prepared to enact legislation that will \"deliver lasting results for his community,\" from protecting reproductive rights to increasing investment in New Hampshire's education and healthcare systems. She praised him for \"shattering a lavender ceiling and proving that America is ready for trans men leaders in our state legislatures,\" in what she called a win for New Hampshire and for trans people everywhere. \"At a time of intensifying transphobia at all levels of government and society, he showed incredible courage throughout his historic campaign,\" she added. \"Trans people \u2014 and trans men in particular \u2014 remain severely underrepresented in government at every level, but we are confident his win will inspire many more trans people to run for office.\" Roesener is not the first openly transgender lawmaker to be elected in New Hampshire. Others include state Reps. Gerri Cannon and Lisa Bunker. There are currently only eight out trans state legislators in the U.S., and none of them are trans men, the Victory Fund says. There are only six out trans men serving in elected office across the country, according to a tracker from the LGBTQ Victory Institute. Roesener's win comes five years after Danica Roem became the first openly transgender person elected to and seated in a U.S. state legislature, when she won a seat in Virginia's House of Delegates. She was reelected to a third term last November. The Victory Fund said in a statement that a record number of LGBTQ candidates \u2014 more than 1,000 \u2014 ran for office in the 2022 midterms.

LOUISVILLE, Ky. \u2013 Kentucky voters have rejected adding language to the state constitution that would make it harder to challenge abortion restrictions in the state, according to a call by The Associated Press. Loading... Amendment 2 would have added this to the state's foundational document: \"To protect human life, nothing in this Constitution shall be construed to secure or protect a right to abortion or require the funding of abortion.\" It would have left the question of access to abortion to the state's Republican-controlled legislature and prevented courts from using the constitution to interpret a right to abortion. Two groups \u2014 Protect Kentucky Access and Yes for Life \u2014 campaigned for months ahead of the election, urging voters to cast ballots on either side of the issue. The ballot initiative's failure doesn't necessarily mean access is protected in the state. Abortions have been banned in most cases in the state for months, after the Kentucky Court of Appeals lifted an injunction blocking two laws. Kentucky was one of more than a dozen states with trigger laws on the books set to go into effect when the United States Supreme Court ruled to overturn Roe v. Wade in June. Kentucky's trigger ban, which outlaws abortion in all but life-threatening cases after around six weeks of pregnancy, was previously blocked in state court. However, Kentucky's Supreme Court allowed the two laws to remain in place while legal challenges continue. The state's high court is expected to hear oral arguments on a challenge to the laws' constitutionality on Nov. 12.",

Follow live updates and election results here. MADISON, Wis. \u2014 Democratic Gov. Tony Evers won reelection to a second term, beating back an effort by Republicans to recapture all branches of government in the perennial swing state. Loading... According to a race call by The Associated Press, Evers defeated Republican challenger Tim Michels, a construction executive who emerged from a contentious GOP primary after an endorsement by former President Donald Trump. Evers was helped in the closing days of the campaign by a visit from former President Barack Obama, who also recorded a TV ad on the governor's behalf. While President Joe Biden visited Wisconsin in September, he stayed away from the state in the closing months of the campaign. So, too, did Trump. Evers' campaign also relentlessly attacked Michels over his long support for banning abortion without exceptions for rape or incest. For Evers, a former teacher who previously served as Wisconsin's state superintendent of public instruction, the victory comes four years after he narrowly defeated former Republican Gov. Scott Walker. Under Walker, Republicans reshaped Wisconsin government, rolling back public and private sector union rights in a state with a long progressive history. Evers spent his first term in office at odds with a Republican-dominated Legislature on everything from COVID-19 policy to election laws. That's likely to happen again after Republicans redrew the state's political maps to give themselves an even bigger advantage in races for the state Senate and Assembly. Evers' victory is significant not so much for what it will let Democrats accomplish but for what it will let them prevent. Over the past two years, Evers vetoed 126 Republican bills, breaking the old record set roughly a century ago. It's also a massive win for Democrats in an election cycle where they faced significant political headwinds. Typically, when one party controls both the White House and Congress, Wisconsin elections swing in the other direction. Evers' victory bucked that trend. More Election 2022 coverage",

Follow live updates and election results here. Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro handily won the commonwealth's governorship, besting state Sen. Doug Mastriano, according to a race call by The Associated Press. Loading... Shapiro, like many Democrats this cycle, campaigned on protecting the right to an abortion. Both chambers of the Pennsylvania legislature have GOP majorities, although that could change this cycle. In 2017, sitting Democratic governor Tom Wolf vetoed a bill to ban abortions at 20 weeks. Shapiro also promoted his record on crime during his time as the commonwealth's top law enforcement officer. He received endorsements from Philadelphia's police union and Republicans turned off by Mastriano's support of overthrowing the 2020 election. By standard measure, Shapiro cruised through much of the election, buoyed by a record-breaking amount of cash. He ran unopposed in the Democratic primary, and enjoyed a significant fundraising edge throughout the race, spending more than $59 million as of October 24. He used those deep coffers to fill the airwaves and launched his first ad targeting Mastriano during the primary. This was viewed as a Democratic strategy to boost opponents viewed as more extreme, in the hopes they would be easier to beat. Originally from Montgomery County, outside of Philadelphia, Shapiro is the former chair of the Montgomery County Commissioners and a former state representative. Shapiro's win also demonstrates the limits of Republicans aligned with former President Donal Trump. Despite an endorsement from the former president, Mastriano pulled in fewer than $6 million dollars for his campaign. The Central Pennsylvania state senator eschewed traditional media and appealed directly to his supporters at town halls and over social media. Mastriano's unconventional team also included multiple advisors who identify as \"prophets.\" His campaign received endorsements from a rabbi who spread Q-Anon conspiracies as well as the founder of AuditTheVote PA, a group spreading false claims about election security. Mastriano, who took a busload of people to Washington, D.C. on Jan. 6th, 2021, has been subpoenaed by the House committee investigating the attack on the Capitol. More Election 2022 coverage",

Before running for Congress, he served as the national organizing director for March for Our Lives, a group that advocates for gun control policy. Gun control continues to be a top issue among younger voters. According to recent polling from Harvard Institute of Politics, 22% of respondents said it was either their most important or second most important issue \u2013 compared to inflation (45%,) abortion (33%) and \"protecting democracy\" (30%). Gun violence prevention was a core tenet of Frost's platform, along with supporting progressive policies like Medicare for all and a Green New Deal. Following the mass shooting in Uvalde, Texas, Frost confronted Florida's Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis at an event over the governor's second amendment views. I just asked @GovRonDeSantis to take action on gun violence so we can save lives. That we lose 100 people a day.

Raphael Warnock and Republican Herschel Walker are heading into a Dec. 6 runoff. With more than 3.9 million votes reported and more left to count, neither candidate was above the 50% threshold needed to win outright under Georgia law. This sets up a post-Thanksgiving showdown in what is already the country's most expensive Senate race. Speaking to supporters just before 2 a.m. on Wednesday, Warnock sounded optimistic about his chances to prevail in the coming weeks. \"Here's where we are: We are not sure if this journey is over tonight, or if there's still a little work yet to do,\" he said. \"But here's what we do know: We know that when they're finished counting the votes from today's election that we're going to have received more votes than my opponent.\" Georgia Republican Senate candidate Herschel Walker speaks at a campaign event in Carrollton in October.\n                \n                    \n                    Elijah Nouvelage/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Georgia Republican Senate candidate Herschel Walker speaks at a campaign event in Carrollton in October. Late Tuesday evening, Walker also expressed his confidence in the final outcome, comparing himself to the main character in the Will Ferrell comedy movie Talladega Nights. \"I'm telling you right now, I'm like Ricky Bobby,\" he said. \"I don't come to lose.\" Georgia's Senate race is the lone bright spot for Democrats, after Gov. Brian Kemp, Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and the rest of the Republican slate notched commanding victories over Democratic challengers in a state that more recently saw narrow margins. Early returns show Walker struggled with Republican support. He earned about 200,000 votes fewer than Kemp, trailing the governor's margin by close to double digits in some GOP strongholds and nearly five points overall. In the closely-divided battleground state, more voters supported Warnock but he failed to clear the 50% needed to win outright. Loading... Warnock, pastor of the historic Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, won a special election runoff in 2021 to fill the final two years of the late Republican Sen. Johnny Isakson's term after his retirement in 2019. His pitch to voters was heavy on accomplishments during his brief time in office, touting legislation that lowered health care costs for senior citizens and painting himself as a champion of bipartisan problem solving in a gridlocked Congress. On the campaign trail, he frequently invoked partnerships with Republicans like Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Alabama Sen. Tommy Tuberville. \"I will work with anybody if it helps me to get something done that's good for Georgia,\" Warnock said at the Democratic Party of Georgia's state convention in September. Warnock found success by mobilizing a coalition of voters in an electorate that has rapidly grown and diversified in recent years, but also through a sizable number of Republicans who said they would not support Walker's controversial campaign. In pre-election interviews and public polling, as many as one in 10 GOP voters in Georgia said they would either vote for Warnock, cast a protest vote for Libertarian Chase Oliver or leave the race blank instead of vote for Walker, a former standout University of Georgia football player backed by Trump whose campaign was dogged by controversy from the start. From the start, Walker's candidacy was plagued with scandals, controversies and misgivings about the first-time candidate's ability to compete in Georgia against Warnock, even in a favorable national environment. Even before he officially entered the race, reporting from local and national outlets uncovered a slew of falsehoods about Walker's personal and professional achievements and questions about his temperament in a high stakes race. In the primary, Walker skipped debates, largely avoided media interviews from non-friendly outlets and cruised to an easy victory before pivoting to face Warnock. Throughout the year, further reporting rocked the campaign by uncovering multiple children previously unknown to the public and alleging Walker paid for multiple abortions with ex-girlfriends, despite his vocal opposition to abortion and support for banning the procedure with no exceptions. Walker also had several policy gaffes throughout the campaign, like a frequently used stump speech line that said spending money to tackle air pollution was wasteful because \"bad air\" from China would float into our \"good air\" and viral responses to questions about school shootings and gun control. Even so, Walker's campaign message centered around blaming Warnock and Democrats in Washington for higher gas prices, inflation and other economic woes while speaking to the party's largely older, white Evangelical base on social issues like LGBTQ rights, abortion and race. \"I'm here to tell you that they will raise your taxes, give you higher inflation, they even put men in women's sports,\" Walker said in the only general election debate he participated in last month. The final stretch of the campaign saw numerous Republican senators come to Georgia and rally for Walker's campaign with a message of making him the deciding seat to win back a majority in the Senate. \"I know that Herschel Walker is going to help build a Republican majority in the United States Senate,\" Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton said at a rally in Atlanta's exurbs in mid-October. \"Herschel will be a leader in the Senate just like he has been a leader in sports and business.\" In a midterm year where Biden's approval ratings are underwater and Democrats are facing blame for the state of the national economy, Walker highlighted Warnock's support of the president and argued that Republican control of Congress would make things different. Once again, all eyes will be on Georgia as another runoff will decide who represents the battleground state for the next six years and where the parties stand heading into the second half of Biden's term.

Janet Mills secured a second term by defeating former Republican Gov. Paul LePage, according to a race call by the Associated Press. LePage was her longtime antagonist who had vowed to challenge her before he left office in 2019. Mills repeatedly clashed with LePage while he was governor and she was state attorney general. Loading... Mills is Maine's first woman elected governor and her staunch support of abortion rights was a centerpiece of her reelection campaign. She and Democratic interest groups relentlessly framed LePage, an abortion opponent, as an untrustworthy steward of a 29-year old state law that enshrines access to the procedure up until fetal viability. During a debate, LePage vowed to veto a bill that would limit access up until 15 weeks of pregnancy, but Democrats and abortion opponents alike said the Republican's comments shouldn't be believed. Mills and Democrats also repeatedly highlighted LePage's long history of false statements and combative conduct that had led some to compare him to former President Donald Trump. LePage, who had aligned with Trump in 2016, made little mention of the former president during the campaign as he sought to rebrand himself as less abrasive and more policy-focused than he was during his eight years as governor. Mills and Democrats described LePage's self-proclaimed transformation as an election ploy that obscured his intent to govern by chaos and division. Mills, 74, has governed as a centrist. Her approach sometimes put her at odds with progressive activists, but likely appealed to independent voters, a large and influential part of the Maine electorate. More Election 2022 coverage:",

Kelly held off Republican challenger Derek Schmidt, the state's attorney general. Kelly's victory means Democrats can block some of the more conservative bills passed by the Republican-dominated Legislature \u2014 particularly efforts to further restrict abortion. The state's voters rejected a constitutional amendment in August that would have made a ban possible, but conservative lawmakers still could have tested just how far the state's courts would allow regulations to make abortions more difficult to obtain in the state. Kelly argued she led the state out of a budget crisis that followed the tax cuts and government service rollbacks pushed through by her Republican predecessors, Sam Brownback and Jeff Colyer. She presented herself as a middle-of-the-road moderate and a business-friendly leader who lured Panasonic's $4 billion electric vehicle battery plant to the state. But Schmidt blamed her for inflation and painted her as a liberal in step with President Joe Biden. He argued Kelly should have done more to make life for Kansans more affordable, like cutting more taxes. He also promised to sign conservative bills passed by the Legislature that Kelly vetoed, including a ban on transgender girls from girls' sports.

Brian Kemp has won a second term, again defeating Democrat Stacey Abrams in one of the most closely-watched campaigns for governor in the country, according to a race call by the Associated Press. Loading... In a speech before supporters Tuesday night Kemp said, \"It looks like the reports of my political death have been greatly exaggerated.\" Four years after their first contentious election when Kemp beat Abrams by about 55,000 votes, both candidates launched their bids as household names. This time, though, the political climate was far less friendly to Democrats. Kemp is an incumbent, beloved by Republicans for notching four years of conservative priorities and respected by some moderates for standing up to former President Donald Trump's pressure to overturn the results of the 2020 election. Abrams entered the race with a global brand, buoyed in part by her role in activating new voters and helping turn Georgia blue in 2020 for the first time in years. In her concession speech Tuesday night she said: \"What we have architected in this state does not end today.\" After crushing a Republican primary challenger backed by former President Donald Trump \u2013 bucking trends among Republican candidates in other states \u2013 Kemp led Abrams in almost every poll heading into the election. Democrats hoped their surprise victories last cycle in Georgia, when President Biden and two Democratic U.S. senators narrowly won, showed their party could finally reclaim the governor's mansion and elect the country's first Black woman to the office in this historically-red state. But even the U.S. Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, which Democrats thought would energize voters, was not enough to push Abrams over the top. Kemp signed a law in 2019 to ban most abortions after about six weeks, which took effect this summer. Abrams also faced voters' frustration over high prices for groceries and gas and Biden's continuing unpopularity. As governor, Kemp signed a new voting law that Democrats have roundly criticized, as well as bills to loosen firearm rules and enact new restrictions on how teachers talk about race in the classroom. But as Kemp worked to court swing voters, he leaned into his handling of the state's economy and frequently touted his decision to reopen schools and businesses early in the pandemic. Efforts by Democrats, notably Abrams, to engage new and irregular voters have shaken up Georgia politics. And with Georgia's diversifying and growing population, Georgia will remain a battleground state. But Tuesday's results show Republicans are still dominant. More Election 2022 coverage:",

During the debate Rubio accused the Biden administration of releasing oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to try to win votes. And when Demings, a former Orlando police chief currently serving in the House of Representatives, accused the senator of not doing enough to prevent school shootings, he countered that her suggested precautions would have stopped nothing. \"Everything she is for would have done nothing to stop any of those shootings,\" Rubio said during the debate. \"Every one of these shooters would have passed the background check that she keeps insisting on. No one here is in favor of mass shootings and violence.\" It's unclear what would have happened had Rubio not won. In September, the senator joined 11 other Republicans \u2014 including Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis \u2014 in declining to answer whether they would accept the election results, The Washington Post reported. Loading...",

ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: On this midterm Election Day, many questions remain, including what might the next two years have in store? NPR went to the polls today and asked voters what they expect from the candidates who win. ELISSA NADWORNY, HOST: In Georgia, Democrat Stacey Abrams is running to defeat Republican Governor Brian Kemp. Voter Dilek Bell in Atlanta hopes she undoes his actions on abortion. DILEK BELL: If Stacey Abrams were to win, I expect her to reverse the abortion ban that Kemp signed into law in January. SHAPIRO: In Waltham, Mass., Anastasia Centore would like to see lawmakers invest more in education. ANASTASIA CENTORE: I'm hoping that they continue to support public schools and the public system from a tax perspective. JASON RODRIGUEZ: I hope what Biden was talking about earlier comes to pass - right? - that we pick up the seats in the House and the Senate that we need to codify Roe, make it the law of the land. And then we can go on and tackle other critical issues that we're facing. SHAPIRO: That's Jason Rodriguez, also in Waltham. ASHLEY CHRISTOPHER: But Ashley Christopher in Kenosha, Wis., would simply like to see the winners stand by their campaign trail promises. CHRISTOPHER: Just hold true to their word, whatever they do promise, to get it done, not just kind of put a word out, advertise and then just lose sight of what the actual goal is - to actually accomplish one of those goals, get something finished and done that's in favor of everybody. You know what I mean? SHAPIRO: Celeste Pendarvis is also an Atlanta voter, and she has a wish for all the winners, regardless of party. CELESTE PENDARVIS: I expect them to find ways to find compromise. I think the issue with our politics now is everyone's so polarized, no one wants to work together. NADWORNY: Voters reflecting on what they expect and hope from those they voted for today. SHAPIRO: We hope you'll listen to our special election night coverage starting at 8 o'clock Eastern. Both the Senate and the House are on the line. You can listen and follow results on npr.org. Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "Polls, races to watch and vote counting: here's what to expect in the 2022 midterm elections.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: In many parts of the country, Americans will soon finish up voting. About 46 million people cast early ballots. And today, lines to vote in some places were hours long. NPR's senior political editor and correspondent Domenico Montanaro is here to tell us what to look out for this evening. Hey, Domenico. DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Hey, Ari. SHAPIRO: What are the first signs that you're going to be watching for? MONTANARO: Well, this is exciting. We're getting real results, first of all, so that's going to be super interesting and fun to do after all this time watching polls. So let's see what the real results say. And we're keeping an eye on, you know, these last few minutes here, you know, how smoothly things are going, sort of the calm before the storm. You've got everybody biting their nails, wondering what's going to happen. You know, you just got to kind of let it wash over. Pretty soon, we'll be right in the thick of it. And we're watching the earliest poll-closing states - places like Indiana, Virginia and Georgia - with key races in the House that are going to likely give us some idea of which direction things are going, Virginia's 2nd Congressional District, for example. Elaine Luria is running there. She's one of the members of the January 6 committee. How salient was the preserving democracy message? How salient is the abortion rights message that so many Democrats in some of these more moderate to right-leaning districts have been running on? SHAPIRO: We keep calling this Election Day, but you have been framing it differently as the next phase... MONTANARO: (Laughter). SHAPIRO: ...Of election season. Why the distinction? (LAUGHTER) MONTANARO: Well, because we're not going to know all the results tonight, probably. You know, people really have to be patient. This could go on a while. And I really have to stress that this is perfectly normal. It takes a long time to count these votes. It's really not how people are used to watching election nights. They see something happen. Broadcast networks can project out what's going to happen oftentimes. But in close elections and close races, this is going to go on for some time. But that's not going to mean we're not going to hear from some of these dozens and dozens of election-denying candidates, who might say - and throw some chaos into the situation - and say that, you know, that there was something that happened that was nefarious, but none of this is nefarious. This is all exactly the way things normally work and work out. I'm also watching turnout tonight. There were some signs that this could be record-breaking turnout, but it sounds like it's actually going to wind up being something short of 2018. I talked to Professor Michael McDonald at the University of Florida, sort of the turnout expert in the country, and he said that Trump is just such a much bigger turnout machine for both parties that we're unlikely to see things match 2018 exactly. SHAPIRO: We know that the House and Senate are both almost evenly divided, and history suggests that Democrats are likely to have a difficult time tonight since the president's party tends to lose seats. How much is that holding true so far? MONTANARO: Yeah. Well, 28 seats on average is what presidents' parties have lost in their first midterms since World War II. And it's 43 seats on average when the president is below 50%, which Biden is and has been since last August when the United States pulled out from Afghanistan. You know, so it's difficult also for Democrats, really, in this environment to make a positive case on something like inflation when you control Washington, even though really blaming Democrats is probably too reductive. You know, it's a lot easier to blame Democrats since they're in charge and the price of groceries are high. It's a much tougher thing to sort of try out a message that says, well, you know, it's really a global supply chain situation, and it's not 100% Democrats' fault when, really, you know, they only put in place some money that went to thousands of people that - or millions of people that was only had a minor effect on inflation. Lot tougher to make that case - and it's why something like abortion rights has been the thing that has really motivated a lot of Democratic voters, especially white women with college degrees and younger voters, who Democrats are trying to push out to the polls. SHAPIRO: You said it's likely that we won't know results tonight, and that's normal. Any sense of when we might? MONTANARO: It's possible we'll find out what the results are in the House some point this evening, maybe late in the evening, but it won't be until late in the evening. Remember, polls close in California and on the West Coast 11 p.m. Eastern time. So we're not going to find out at least until then at the earliest. The Senate could go on for days if not weeks. I mean, think about the Georgia Senate race, for example. You know, both parties need just one seat as a net gain to take over the Senate because it's only 50-50, that Georgia Senate race. If nobody gets to 50% or higher tonight, that's going to go to a December 6 runoff, which could very well mean control of the Senate not decided for a month. SHAPIRO: And what are the chances that some of these election deniers are going to potentially throw the outcome of a legitimate election into chaos through court challenges or other refusals to acknowledge the outcome? MONTANARO: I think we have to be very prepared for that as a real, distinct possibility. There's a lot of intensity around these elections. There's a lot of distrust around the elections, especially on the Republican side because of what former President Trump has sowed in lying about the fact that he believes he lost the 2020 election, even though that's not the case - that he won and it was taken away from him, which is not the case. But we've already seen from Trump tonight, talking about this afternoon, talking about how there's issues with voting in Arizona, which we know are not entirely the entire big case. SHAPIRO: We'll see how it plays out. NPR senior political editor and correspondent Domenico Montanaro, thank you very much. MONTANARO: You're welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.

ELISSA NADWORNY, HOST: It's Election Day in America, and millions are heading to the polls today. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: Early voting numbers surpassed those from the last midterm in 2018. More than 45 million early votes were cast ahead of today. And after months of speculation about what will happen, this is the last chance for voters to have their say. NADWORNY: NPR spoke to many casting their ballots across the country today to find out what's bringing them to the polls this midterm election. Life after Roe v. Wade is a top-of-mind issue for voters like Celeste Pendarvis in Atlanta, Ga. CELESTE PENDARVIS: Definitely abortion rights and getting folks in office that will preserve that right. SHAPIRO: The threat of recession and the reality of inflation are also motivating voters across the country, including Tom Donlin in Waltham, Mass. TOM DONLIN: And the economy in general - you know, we're at the age we're dependent on our 401(k). And you certainly want the stock market to go back in the right direction. And I think that's all tied in with inflation and, you know, government policies to bring down prices on essentials and get the supply chain moving and keep it moving. SHAPIRO: And guns continue to be a focus for voters, like Gladie Feliciano in Phoenix, Ariz. GLADIE FELICIANO: We have a right to bear arms. I think that if somebody comes into our homes, that we should be able to protect ourselves in our own home. But outside of it, like, kids should be able to go to school safely, you know? And I think that there has to be something in place to be able to change. NADWORNY: Also, student debt - Marvin Casasola in Waltham has over $100,000 in loans and says the Biden administration's current promise just isn't enough. MARVIN CASASOLA: I'm one of those students that, you know - or was one of those students still in debt, hoping something can come out of that and that promise that he made when he was running for election. And now, only up to $20,000 cancellation - that's the interest on the capital for, like, a couple of years. SHAPIRO: Jade Santiago in Tampa, Fla., says she's concerned about a number of social issues. JADE SANTIAGO: Our current governor is attacking certain LGBTQ+ rights, women's rights, education rights. And I went in there keeping that in mind because I'm an education major, and I fear for my future as an educator.

All are 2022 candidates for governor who would make history if elected. Follow live updates from Election Day 2022 here. U.S. politicians are supposed to represent the entire public, but the majority come from a group that makes up less than one-third of Americans: white men. Take the 50 U.S. state governors in office. Forty-seven are white without Latino heritage, and 41 are men, according to Rutgers University's Eagleton Institute of Politics. But 2022 is shaping up to be a history-making year. \"We have a record number of women who are running for governor in this cycle,\" says Debbie Walsh, director of the Center for Women and Politics at Rutgers University. States are also poised to elect a Black governor for just the third time in the nation's history, and the first openly lesbian governor. Successful candidates that are not white or male \"really disrupt a lot of the stereotypes and the images of what it means to be a top level leader,\" says Walsh, and that can lay the foundation for even more diverse representation in higher office. For example, the United States has never had a female president, she says. Here are six races where one, or both, gubernatorial candidates would be a \"first,\" either in their state or nationwide, if elected. While not a comprehensive list, these are races where such history-making candidates are favored to win or are in a close race. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, former Trump White House press secretary, addresses the America First Policy Institute's America First Agenda Summit at the Marriott Marquis on July 26.\n                \n                    \n                    Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Former White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders is on the ballot in Arkansas. If elected, she would be the state's first female governor. Polling averages show Sanders, a Republican, with a double-digit lead over her opponent, according to FiveThirtyEight. While unlikely he would be elected in 2022, Democratic candidate Chris Jones, a former non-profit executive who attended M.I.T., would be the first Black governor to represent the Natural State. Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams speaks at a rally in Atlanta on Saturday\n                \n                    \n                    Nathan Posner/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption No state has ever elected a Black woman to the governor's office. In Georgia, Democratic candidate Stacey Abrams is running to oust sitting Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican. A voting rights advocate and former state lawmaker, Abrams has pushed to increase Democratic turnout in Georgia. Those efforts were credited with helping President Joe Biden win the state \u2013 and the White House \u2013 in 2020. In her first race against Kemp in 2018, Abrams came within two percentage points of winning the governor's office. However, polls currently show the rematch leaning Republican. Maryland Democratic gubernatorial nominee Wes Moore addresses a campaign rally at the Stamp Student Union on the campus of the University of Maryland on Oct. 26 in College Park.\n                \n                    \n                    Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Maryland Democratic gubernatorial nominee Wes Moore addresses a campaign rally at the Stamp Student Union on the campus of the University of Maryland on Oct. 26 in College Park. In solidly blue Maryland, Democratic candidate Wes Moore would be the first Black governor in the state's history. Down ballot also shows more first potential, as NPR previously reported. Democratic candidate for lieutenant governor Aruna Miller would be the first Asian-American to hold statewide office in the Free State. In the state attorney general's race, U.S. Rep. Anthony Brown could be the first African-American elected to the role. Brooke Lierman, a state delegate, is running to be Maryland's first female comptroller. All are Democrats. If Abrams loses in Georgia, Moore could be the only Black governor in the United States, and only the third African-American ever elected governor in the country. Massachusetts Attorney General and Democratic candidate for governor Maura Healey speaks during a campaign rally in support of the statewide Massachusetts Democratic ticket on Nov. 2 in Boston.\n                \n                    \n                    Mary Schwalm/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption State Attorney General Maura Healey, a Democrat, is running to fill a seat left open by outgoing Republican Gov.

Paul Cellucci accepted a post as the U.S. Ambassador to Canada. Healey, along with Oregon's Tina Kotek (below), are likely to be the first openly lesbians elected as governors in the United States. The Cook Political Report rates the Massachusetts race as leaning solidly Democrat. Kathy Hochul, governor of New York, speaks during a Get Out The Vote event at Barnard College on Nov. 3.\n                \n                    \n                    Anthony Behar/Sipa/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Kathy Hochul is already the first female governor in New York. But 2022 is the first time voters could choose her for the role.

Hochul faces U.S. Congressman Lee Zeldin, a Republican who currently represents the 1st District in Long Island. Democratic gubernatorial nominee Tina Kotek speaks with members of the media before casting her ballot at a ballot drop box on Nov. 2 in Portland, Ore.\n                \n                    \n                    Mathieu Lewis-Rolland/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Democratic gubernatorial nominee Tina Kotek speaks with members of the media before casting her ballot at a ballot drop box on Nov. 2 in Portland, Ore. Tina Kotek (along with Massachusetts's Maura Healey) could be the first openly lesbian governor in the nation. However, the Oregon race is rated a toss-up between Kotek and GOP candidate Christine Drazan. The X factor is independent candidate Betsy Johnson, a former Democrat with deep-pocketed supporters. This midterm cycle has the highest number of all-female matchups in gubernatorial races, according to The Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University. Oregon currently has an openly bisexual governor, Democrat Kate Brown, and Colorado elected openly gay Gov. Jared Polis in 2018. If Drazan claims victory, she'll be Oregon's first Republican governor in 40 years. That would be its own kind of history making.",

            "article_content": "Young conservative voters aren't a monolith. They have different policy priorities and different views on what role former President Donald Trump should play in the Republican Party.  AILSA CHANG, HOST: In 2018 and 2020, young people turned out to vote in historically high numbers, helping Democrats cement their power in Washington. NPR's Barbara Sprunt spoke with young Republicans voting for the first time on Tuesday about the future of their party. BARBARA SPRUNT, BYLINE: Kaetlyn Diaz, a sophomore at the University of California Irvine, says it's time for the GOP to take notice of its young members. KAETLYN DIAZ: There's people who - you know, they don't want to pass on the microphone or the torch. But I see young people in the Republican Party rising up more and more. SPRUNT: Diaz lists restricting abortion access and cutting back federal dollars to support Ukraine in the wake of Russia's invasion as top issues. DIAZ: If they spent that money from Ukraine to forgive student loans, I'd be glad about that. I think that's a better cause than going to Ukraine. SPRUNT: She says people often just assume she supports Democrats. DIAZ: When people find out I'm pro-life, they're very shocked. And I've had people, like, I guess, dumbfounded because, you know, I'm, like, a woman of color, disabled. Or they expect me to have certain political views, and I don't have those political views. SPRUNT: Abby Kiesa of CIRCLE, a Tufts University research group focused on youth political engagement, says that kind of misconception is common. ABBY KIESA: It's important to bust a myth that all young people under 30 are liberal. SPRUNT: In the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections, over a third of young people voted for Donald Trump. KIESA: There is a strong majority of young people who identify as Republicans. SPRUNT: That doesn't mean they're ideologically identical. While Diaz doesn't think there should be exceptions to limits on abortion outside of health of the mother, Reece Smith, an 18-year-old living in Charlottesville, Va., and a fellow conservative, has a different take. REECE SMITH: In cases of rape, incest or the mother's life is in danger, then it's something that is necessary, and it's health care. If you ban abortion, people aren't going to stop doing it. So I prefer for it to be in a safe environment. SPRUNT: Smith lists crime and inflation as her top issues, but she said she's also concerned by GOP lawmakers like Marjorie Taylor Greene in Georgia, whom she calls a distraction. SMITH: She has said things that are terrible. The thing about the Jewish space lasers is ridiculous. And I don't like it when Republicans go after other Republicans in the party. SPRUNT: Connor Gibson from Hattiesburg, Miss., is another young Republican who's worried about the divisions in the party. CONNOR GIBSON: The extremes have taken over not in the sense of in numbers but in rhetoric. And it really overshadows a lot of policy discussions that we need to be having. SPRUNT: He's finishing up his term as chairman of Mississippi Teenage Republicans. His group has been outspoken against conspiracy theories like QAnon. He wants to see the conversation recenter on kitchen-table issues like boosting the economy and lowering inflation. GIBSON: For me, it is about lower taxes, less government and not about these crazy culture wars that a lot of people like to chase down rabbit holes. SPRUNT: Matt Landau, who goes to college in Arizona, agrees there's a lot of debate over what role former President Trump should have in the future of the Republican Party. MATT LANDAU: As far as who I want to see run, I mean, who got me into politics is Trump. So I got to stick with my guy. I mean, he got me into this whole thing. SPRUNT: But he said he's worried that Trump is just too polarizing to win the general election in 2024. LANDAU: A lot of conservatives don't want to say it right now. And I think you got to say it. It's like, you can't just blindly say, Trump's our guy; let's have him run, and then he loses like he did in 2020. SPRUNT: But Diaz, the California voter, says she still sees Trump as the person to lead the GOP. DIAZ: We all need to unite behind Trump because he's - ever since he became president, I would admit that the GOP has taken a shift further to the right, and I think that's a good thing. SPRUNT: Reports suggest Trump is considering launching his 2024 presidential bid in mid-November. Barbara Sprunt, NPR News, Washington. Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.  All rights reserved.

With one day left before voting ends in this year's midterm elections, the latest NPR-PBS NewsHour-Marist poll shows some warning signs for Democrats \u2014 specifically regarding who is more likely to vote in this year's races. Across factors including age, race, income and gender, the survey shows Black voters are among the least enthusiastic about voting in the midterms. And Black voters have, historically, voted for Democrats at a higher rate, with Black women among the most reliable voters within the party. However, as with any voting bloc, there's still a vast array of diverging opinions, ideologies and issues that are important among Black voters. \"At the end of the day, it really comes down to the choice [of] abortion rights ...as well as voting rights,\" said Al Heartley, of Smyrna, Ga. Heartley told NPR he's voting for Democratic candidate Stacey Abrams in the state's closely watched race for governor, in addition to Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock for U.S. Senate. However, he says that his experiences as a Black man in the U.S. should matter to politicians. \"Black men have a voice and have a perspective,\" Heartley said. \"You have to acknowledge where I am as a Black person first. To me, that's what Warnock and Abrams really do.\" For voters like Donnell Brunson of Fairness Hills, Pa., relatability matters when it comes to voting for politicians.

I like my politicians more 'of the people,'\" Brunson told NPR. Even though he is supporting Democrat John Fetterman in the U.S. Senate race over the Republican candidate, Dr. Mehmet Oz, Brunson says he doesn't feel like politicians across the country understand what it takes to win support from more Black men. \"It's clear to me that they don't have minorities or people of color in their inner circle advising them. They're assuming what we want,\" Brunson said. \"And we want the same things other voters want: jobs, economics, education.\" Talib Abdul Mujib, owner of barber shop 1617, shapes up a customer's hair line in the North Philadelphia neighborhood of Philadelphia on Friday, October 21, 2022.

Mujib tells NPR that he does not plan on voting in the larger races \u2014 as he feels as though politicians don't value opinions of Black voters. While college-educated white women, who are an important bloc for Democrats, are among the most enthusiastic to vote, recent polling further suggests that Black and Latino voters, in addition to young voters, are among the least. Terrance Woodbury, CEO of HIT Strategies, a polling firm specializing in understanding young and minority voters, tells NPR's All Things Considered that while there is a gender gap in voting when it comes to Black men and women, it's not particularly unique to Black voters \u2014 but to voters across all races. \"What's unique about Black male voters is that they were Democratic voters; they were supporting Barack Obama at 90%+ margins,\" said Woodbury. \"Now that we've seen that decline to 79% or 80%, it is in fact enough to make the marginal difference in states like Georgia, Wisconsin and North Carolina where they have diverse candidates at the top of the ticket,\" he added. Recent data from pollsters suggest that candidates from either party should focus on key issues in order to close the enthusiasm gap \u2014 especially with Black men. \"While this election cycle is being defined by democrats, by the threat of the other side ...the threat of losing democracy, that in fact Black men are more motivated by the progress Democrats have made,\" Woodbury said. In recent polling by HIT Strategies, 73% of Black men said their lives had not improved since Biden took office last year. However, when given a list of policies to those being polled \u2014 such as the Child Tax Credit, the police reform executive order and the bipartisan infrastructure bill \u2014 Woodbury says that 90% of Black men said that the progress indeed improved their lives. \"It's clear to me that it seems like we're dealing with a messaging problem and connecting Black men with the progress that's being made,\" he said.

Right: Rep. Andrea Salinas, D-Lake Oswego, speaks at a PCUN rally to kick off a campaign for farmworker overtime on Nov. 16, 2021 at the Oregon State Capitol in Salem, Ore. On a recent rainy Saturday, about two dozen Democratic volunteers squeezed into a small office in a Portland, Oregon suburb. Democratic candidate Andrea Salinas addressed canvassers at her Tualatin, Oregon office in an increasingly tight race in the state's new 6th Congressional District. \"Thank you all so much. I consider this soggy sock season here in Oregon when we're all out there canvassing and making sure we're talking to voters,\" Salinas said. The state of Oregon has long been a safe blue haven for Democrats. But this year, Republicans are threatening upsets in races across the state. Recently, the Cook Political Report shifted Oregon's newest congressional district from lean Democratic to a toss-up as the GOP candidate there gains momentum. The district, which was the center of one of the most expensive races in the country earlier this year, runs southwest of Portland into vast wine country and past the state capital of Salem. The district's mix of urban and rural areas is making for a tight political race this year, said Chris Stout, a politics professor at Oregon State University. \"In a year like 2022, where Republicans are having an advantage and people are concerned about crime ... inflation, it makes it a much more competitive race,\" Stout said. Ultimately, the contest in this district could help tell a larger national story about how far the Republican Party's reach truly goes this election cycle. The new Oregon congressional district also boasts the state's largest concentration of Latino residents, with 21% identifying as Hispanic. Yolanda Welch, who came out to canvass for Salinas, said she relates to Salinas' Mexican roots. \"She grew up like me,\" Welch, who moved to Oregon region in 1974, said in her native Spanish. Welch said Salinas, a former longtime state lawmaker, can respond to rising inflation. Welch, a working caretaker, said she's turned off by the GOP. \"I'm not like Republicans. They have so much money. I don't,\" Welch said with a laugh. The district's GOP candidate, Mike Erickson, is a wealthy supply chain executive who has self funded much of his campaign. So far, both sides have raised more than $2 million. Erickson has gained traction with rural voters while Salinas commands support in urban and suburban areas. And recently, the Congressional Leadership Fund, a political action committee tied to House GOP leaders, dumped another $800,000 in ads into the district. In an emailed statement to NPR, Erickson said Oregonians have tired of higher costs and a long-running homeless crisis that has not improved under Democrats' watch. \"Oregonians are struggling with out-of-control inflation and gas prices due to reckless Democrat spending. Oregonians are tired of watching our state falling behind in education, disrespecting and underfunding law enforcement, and allowing camping on public property,\" Erickson said. \"The Democrats have had decades to work on and solve the problem, and it just is getting worse.\" Erickson also said he believes he's well-positioned to represent the district's Latino population because of his business background and ability to address inflation. He's a perennial Republican candidate and lost several previous election runs. In past runs, Erickson was hurt after he was linked to an ex-girlfriend's abortion and recently said he wasn't aware the woman sought the service. He was also arrested in 2016 for driving under the influence. He's now suing Salinas over a related ad to the DUI arrest. Erickson declined to elaborate on the claims to NPR, but told the Oregonian the DUI arrest was one mistake against the law. \"I've never been perfect,\" he said. Erickson and his supporters say despite past setbacks, this year is his chance to get to the U.S. Capitol. At a coffee shop in the town of McMinnville, Republican Chris Chenoweth says despite those setbacks, timing is finally on Erickson's side. \"I think Mike's going to win,\" Chenoweth said. Chenoweth, who sits on McMinnville's city council, which is located in a rural pocket of Oregon's 6th Congressional District, said national issues are energizing the district's Republicans. \"You start looking at your bread and butter kitchen table issues. It's headwinds against the Democrats for this election cycle,\" Chenoweth said. Salinas, who won a bitter Democratic primary this year, remains bullish as she talks more about the economy and other top worries. \"I don't have to be the ... flag bearer for the Democratic Party,\" Salinas said. \"I want to be the flag bearer for the people of the 6th Congressional District. Right. And really addressing their needs, because I know that people are suffering right now. And that is what motivates me to do the work.\"",

The night before her abortion, Melissa had to travel to another state. She drove overnight from Ohio to Michigan, and didn't reach her hotel until 3 a.m. But just a few hours later, she had arrived on time for her 8 a.m. check-in at the front desk of Northland Family Planning in Sterling Heights, Mich. Melissa is part of a record surge of abortion patients pouring into Michigan since Roe v. Wade was overturned this summer. For nearly three months, Melissa says, she had been trying \u2014 and failing \u2014 to find an abortion closer to home. By the time she arrived at Northland, she was 14 weeks pregnant. \"I was so relieved, after the struggle,\" Melissa says, \"Because I had to sit with [this pregnancy] for weeks.\" NPR agreed to not to use full names for all the patients interviewed in this story because of the intimate medical information discussed concerning a highly politicized and controversial issue. This story was produced in partnership with Kaiser Health News. The Northland waiting room is built to feel welcoming, even pretty. Big windows look out on tall pines bending in the breeze. The TV is set to the cheerful chatter of women remodeling their modern farmhouses on HGTV. On the walls are inspirational quotes, including \"Good women get abortions.\" And \"Brave, beautiful women have been where you are right now.\" The patients here wait quietly, and alone \u2014 no spouses, no boyfriends, no family or friends. Melissa had swept her hair into a loose bun, and pulled her hands inside the sleeves of her sweatshirt. Finally she was here. She had made it. Northland was started in 1976 by Renee Chelian. She had undergone an illegal abortion at age 15, back in 1966, seven years before Roe v. Wade. \"'You can never tell anyone, because no man will ever marry you if he knows that this has happened,'\" Chelian recalled her father telling her afterward. 'You're going to be OK. We're going to take care of you. After this conversation, we'll never discuss it again.'\" Northland now has three locations in the greater Detroit region. Across Michigan, there are more than two dozen clinics that provide abortions. In recent months, patients have been traveling to Michigan for abortion care from Wisconsin, Indiana, Oklahoma, even as far as Florida and Texas. But abortion rights in Michigan are far from certain: court battles have been continuing for months over a 1931 state law that criminalized abortions, with no exceptions for rape or incest. After Roe v. Wade established a federal right to abortion, that law lay dormant for decades, but was still on the books. Earlier this year, both Planned Parenthood and Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer filed lawsuits to prevent the law from going back into effect. So far, courts have blocked enforcement of the 1931 law. But the appeals and judicial wrangling continue \u2014 and the uncertainty has been stressful and confusing for abortion providers in Michigan. On August 1 for example, rapid-fire court rulings meant that abortion in Michigan was legal at breakfast, illegal at lunchtime, but legal once again by dinner.

Chelian had an abortion in 1966 at age 15, seven years before Roe v. Wade. Ultimately, if abortion is going to stay legal in Michigan, it could come down to this election. On Tuesday, voters will decide whether to pass Proposal 3, which would explicitly enshrine the right to abortion in the Michigan constitution, as well as other reproductive rights. Today, anyone visiting Northland Family Planning's website is greeted with a pop-up window urging them to vote 'Yes' on Prop 3 on Nov. 8. Northland's founder Chelian, now 71, is like a hummingbird: a petite powerhouse who never stops moving. She has spent most of her adult life pouring that energy into creating the clinics she wished had existed when she was 15: spaces that are spotless but not soulless, where soothing music plays in the procedure rooms. After their appointments, patients receive a brown paper bag with their prescriptions inside, and their names and a small heart drawn in pink marker on the front. Northland feels very different from the first place Melissa went to a few months ago, when she discovered she was pregnant. At first, she panicked. A mom of two, Melissa was going through a divorce, working full time, and getting her bachelor's degree. She called what she thought was a women's health clinic near her home in Ohio, and staff there promised her they could refer her for an abortion. When she arrived, a nurse gave her an ultrasound and told her she was a few weeks pregnant. But then the appointment took an unexpected turn. \"She wanted to pray for me,\" Melissa says. \"She gave me a Bible. It didn't even seem like it was religion until the very end ... They were posing to be so pro-choice, and they're not.\" Melissa had ended up at a crisis pregnancy center. Such centers are usually religious, and most aren't licensed medical clinics, though their advertising can be misleading. Their primary goal is to convince people not to get an abortion. At Northland, Melissa cried as she remembered the confrontational conversations she had with staff inside the crisis pregnancy center. \"I'm in this weird situation of, I'm going through a divorce, and I slept with somebody one time. And then I got pregnant. And they were like, 'Are you sure that you don't see a future with this guy? What if we brought him in here?' They were trying to talk me into having a baby that I couldn't have, and then they're trying to talk me into a relationship. It's crazy.\" Once Melissa understood the Ohio center wasn't going to help her, she tried to make her own appointment. At the time, abortions in Ohio were banned after six weeks. And every clinic near her home had long wait lists. By the time Melissa got this appointment in Michigan, she was 14 weeks pregnant. \"And I just feel so much better, because I have two kids, I have a ten-year-old and a two-year-old,\" she says, taking a deep breath. \"It shouldn't be this hard.\" Renee Chelian has spent most of her adult life pouring energy into creating the kind of clinics she wishes existed when she was 15: spaces that are spotless but not soulless, with sunny rooms full of soothing music.\n                \n                    \n                    Paulette Parker/Michigan Radio\n                    \n                \nhide caption Renee Chelian has spent most of her adult life pouring energy into creating the kind of clinics she wishes existed when she was 15: spaces that are spotless but not soulless, with sunny rooms full of soothing music.

Earlier this year, Lance was dyeing the tips of her short brown hair purple \u2014 it helps nervous young patients relax when she walks in and they see their abortion doctor is actually a woman with cool purple hair. Every little moment of connection and ease is important, given how public, politicized and ugly the legal fights over abortion have become, Lance says. \"It has been a hard couple of months, ever since the Dobbs decision.\" In Michigan, the fighting in the courts about the state's 1931 abortion ban continued for months. Was it in effect or not? Could it be enforced? \"And it seems like every week, sometimes every day, there was a new thing happening that was affecting how we could work, or whether we could work and whether we could continue to provide care,\" Lance says. \"People care about this,\" Lance says. \"People are pissed. They are really, really pissed.\" Despite the turmoil of recent months, she's optimistic Prop. 3 will pass, and nullify forever any threat from that 1931 ban. \"I am hopeful. But...\" she sighs, then pauses. \"I think you just have to be. How could I come to work everyday if I wasn't?\" Northland's clinic in Sterling Heights sees about 22 to 24 patients a day. On the nine days a public radio reporter visited, about half of the patients agreed to an interview or allowed the reporter to accompany them during the office visit or surgical procedure. The patients wanted to explain what abortion access meant for their own lives - especially given the upcoming ballot referendum in Michigan: If people are going to be voting on this, I want them to know what this really looks like. Among them was a woman in her early 30s who wanted to be identified only by her first initial, A. A. is a slender, energetic mom with big, bright eyes. She's quick to cut through any tension with a joke. But she dissolves into tears when asked about why she came to Northland. \"I don't think I could survive if I knew that I had to have these babies with an abusive person,\" A. says. \"That's insanity to me. I feel like a prisoner.\" A. has two toddler girls, and says her former partner had been violent. She took the girls and left, and was trying to get a personal protection order when she found out she was pregnant with twins. She told her 3-year-old daughter that she wasn't going to keep this pregnancy. \"My daughter was so cute. She said, 'OK, well, maybe another time, maybe later.' I was like, 'Yes, maybe later.'\" Her face clouds over. \"Because she doesn't know that at the end of the day I can't physically, financially or mentally handle two more kids.\" She's tried in the past to get her tubes tied, she says. \"I've asked and begged to be, like, fixed or snipped or whatever it is that they have to do. They deny me,\" she says, sobbing. \"But then I end up on medication for birth control. It's insanity.\" \"And I'm so fertile that it's like, literally, I just, I have to stop having sex in order not to be pregnant. So, abortion, even though this is my first one, I'm happy that it's here because I don't know what I would do right now.\" After a moment, A. wipes the tears off her face. She manages a small smile. \"That's more sharing than I've done in like, ten years. I'm like the Grinch: my heart's getting bigger.\" A. is what you might imagine when you think about why someone would need an abortion: An abusive relationship. Money problems. Emotional distress. And you do see a lot of that at Northland. But you also see patients who are in great relationships, they're financially stable, and emotionally composed. Women like M. \u2014 who also asked to be identified only by her first initial. \"I want to go back to work and just kind of have something for myself other than just be a mother all day, every day,\" she says, tucking a strand of hair behind her ear. M. is married and has three kids, the youngest of which is about to enter school. After ten years of staying at home with her children, M. felt like she was on the cusp of something new. \"And I wouldn't trade my kids for anything, I love them to death,\" M. says. \"But I just feel like that phase of my life is over. And it was an amazing phase. But I don't want to keep going back. I want to go forward.\" Dr. Audrey Lance prepares for a procedure.\n                \n                    \n                    Paulette Parker/Michigan Radio\n                    \n                \nhide caption Dr. Audrey Lance prepares for a procedure. At Northland, the pills for medication abortions are prescribed and dispensed in the morning, while the afternoon is dedicated to the surgical procedures. \"Okay, so I'm just going to get you set up on the table and we're going to do that sedation medicine,\" Lance tells one patient, who agreed that the reporter could observe and record her procedure, but asked that she not be identified. The woman, who is from Michigan and already has a toddler, was about 11 weeks pregnant. Nearly 90% of abortions performed in Michigan are done within the first 13 weeks of pregnancy \u2014 and more than half are medication abortions. Once the procedure starts, the lights are dimmed and soothing music plays. The patient wears a medical gown, her bare legs in stirrups, and the staffer next to her, holds her hand and guides her through it. For several of the procedures that the reporter observed, Northland staff member Brandee was the person who comforted and coached the patients. \"Squeeze my hand, and just keep breathing,\" she says, leaning in close. It's typical for patients to be partially awake during first trimester abortions. Northland Family Planning gives every patient numbing medication applied to the cervix, and intravenous medications for pain and anxiety (fentanyl and midazolam). You may feel some strong cramping and intense pressure, Lance tells her patient, \"but I know you can do it.\" You're going to blow out your breath like you're blowing out a candle, Brandee instructs, firmly and clearly. The patient grips Brandee's hand tighter, her eyes squinting in discomfort. \"I can't,\" the patient gasps at one point, when the cramps became intense. \"You can do it,\" Brandee says. \"Keep breathing. You're almost done. Just keep breathing.\" And then, after just a couple minutes, it's over. \"You did it!\" Brandee says. The patient's relief is palpable. \"Thank you guys so much,\" she murmurs. At Northland, what you hear a lot from patients is: I'm doing this because I have this picture for my life, and the things I want. One woman, who asked that we not identify her, says she knows she wants to be a mom eventually. But first, she wants to finish school. Sitting in the waiting area, this patient talked about how hard the journey to Northland had been. How she hid it from her mom at first, until her aunties threatened to tell her mom if she didn't do it herself. How her mom was surprisingly supportive, getting up early with her that morning, and making sure she ate a good breakfast before her appointment. The patient shifted from side to side in her chair. She wore a spotless set of matching sweats, a low ponytail tucked beneath a crisp baseball hat. Sure, she says, she knows that a lot of women get abortions. But that doesn't make this feel any easier. \"We feel like we have to sneak in, do this,\" she says. \"Some of us put our lives at risk doing it.\" But she did not want to be trapped with the guy who got her pregnant, she says. She asked him if he could help her pay for this abortion. But the most he could do, he told her, was split it. \"The guys, they're never held responsible for things like this, ever,\" she says. \"It's always the woman. We always got to step up and take care of it. Whether we keep it or not, it's always put in our lap.\" Nearly every patient interviewed at Northland knew about Prop. 3, the constitutional amendment to protect abortion rights in Michigan. Some of them were hopeful it would pass. Others were scared it wouldn't. Lots of them were in disbelief that abortion care had become something they had to fight for. And some, like this patient in the baseball cap, were angry. When asked if there was anything she wanted voters to know, she said yes: \"Stop thinking it can't touch you. It could touch you in so many ways. It could be your mother. It could be your sister. It could be your niece. It could be your daughter. Your future, your future daughter. Your future wife. Stop thinking it's not going to touch you, man or woman.\" This story was edited by Carrie Feibel and produced as part of NPR's health reporting partnership with Michigan Radio and Kaiser Health News (KHN).",

            "article_content": "For some Florida voters, Gov. Ron DeSantis' potential bid for president in 2024 is weighing into their 2022 decision.  ADRIAN FLORIDO, HOST: As we just heard, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis is widely believed to be considering a run for president in 2024, but he's also favored to win reelection as governor on Tuesday. And so a big question on many voters' minds is whether DeSantis will stick around to finish another four-year term. Here's Valerie Crowder of member station WFSU in Tallahassee. VALERIE CROWDER, BYLINE: Governor DeSantis hasn't said he's running for president, but he's given stump speeches for GOP candidates in key battleground states. He's raised about $200 million for his reelection campaign, with more than 90 million still in the bank. And pro-DeSantis mailers have even gone out to addresses outside Florida. At a recent debate, DeSantis' challenger, Charlie Crist, grilled him on his political ambitions. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CHARLIE CRIST: Will you serve a full four-year term if you're reelected governor of Florida? It's not a tough question. It's a fair question. He won't tell you. CROWDER: In response, DeSantis didn't confirm or deny plans for a White House bid and hit back at Crist for bringing up the issue. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) RON DESANTIS: Well, listen, I know that Charlie is interested in talking about 2024 and Joe Biden, but I just want to make things very, very clear. The only worn-out, old donkey I'm looking to put out to pasture is Charlie Crist. CROWDER: For some Democratic voters, DeSantis possibly running for president in two years is a strike against him in this year's race for governor. At an early voting site in Tallahassee, 32-year-old Brandon Moton cast his ballot for Crist. He says he's unhappy with DeSantis' first term, especially the way the governor has handled abortion, voting rights and the economy. BRANDON MOTON: I think his focus is on a presidential run as opposed to what our state needs right now. CROWDER: Some Republican voters, on the other hand, aren't turned off by the idea of the governor resigning midway through his term if reelected, but they aren't thrilled about it either. Jill Thorne voted for him. She's 68 and a Republican. JILL THORNE: I'd prefer he stay in Florida, but, yeah, I'll probably support him if he runs for president. CROWDER: And GOP voter Giles Levy, who's 55, says he thinks it would be great if DeSantis runs for president, even if it would mean a shorter term as governor if he wins. GILES LEVY: That would be too bad, but I'd be OK with it. CROWDER: It's not a question of if voters are thinking about DeSantis potentially running for president, it's whether that could cost him votes in this election, says Florida-based political analyst Susan MacManus. SUSAN MACMANUS: It could be a reinforcement to people who are thinking about voting against him, but that's just the last straw. So maybe for some people who are what we call leaners but undecided as to whether they're going to go vote, it might have some impact. CROWDER: MacManus says the issue might matter more if the governor's race were closer this time around. It was close in 2018. DeSantis won by less than half a percentage point. But in the last four years, Republicans have surpassed Democrats by nearly 300,000 registered voters in Florida. And MacManus says, a Democratic victory is even less likely this time around. MACMANUS: It's a real, real long shot. There's not been a poll taken in Florida - with one exception, and that was an outlier - that shows that Crist is leading DeSantis. CROWDER: MacManus says if DeSantis is reelected governor, then he'll likely take a more measured approach to appeal to voters nationally. A sitting governor in Florida has never run for president, and that's uncharted legal territory. One thing is clear - Lieutenant Governor Jeanette Nunez would be next in line to take over the office, even though voters know little about her. For NPR News, I'm Valerie Crowder in Tallahassee.

            "article_content": "With just days to go until the final ballots are cast in the 2022 midterms, new trends are emerging as candidates make their final pitch to voters.  ADRIAN FLORIDO, HOST: We're just two days away from Election Day, though voters have been casting ballots for weeks. Still, this is the final chance candidates have to pitch themselves to voters, hoping to gain any and every advantage going into Tuesday night, including pulling out some political heavyweights. Here to help us understand what to expect going into Tuesday and what maybe not to expect is NPR senior political editor and correspondent Domenico Montanaro. Domenico, thanks for being here. DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Adrian, good to be with you. FLORIDO: It's a busy weekend for the campaigns. Former Presidents Obama and Trump have been on the campaign trail. So has President Joe Biden. They all converged on Pennsylvania yesterday. MONTANARO: Yeah. This is probably one of the most critical states to the election, if not the most critical state to the election. You know, there are four big Senate races that both sides are kind of watching - Pennsylvania and Georgia on the East Coast and Nevada and Arizona in the West. And the only target there that's a Democratic potential pickup is Pennsylvania, so winning there really shrinks Republicans' path to control of the Senate if Democrats can pick it up. And let's take a listen to some of what we heard and what we've been hearing from these big surrogates in these closing days. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE) PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Your right to vote is on the ballot. Social Security and Medicare is on the ballot. There's something else on the ballot - character. Character's on the ballot. BARACK OBAMA: Truth and facts and logic and reason and basic decency are on the ballot. Democracy itself is on the ballot. The stakes are high. DONALD TRUMP: I promise you, in the very next, very, very, very short period of time, you're going to be so happy, OK? And one of the reasons I don't want to do that right now - 'cause I'd like to do it - but you know what? - and I really mean this - I want to have the focus tonight be on Dr. Oz and on Doug Mastriano because we have to vote. MONTANARO: And you heard President Biden and former Presidents Obama and Trump, and Trump alluding very strongly there to a potential 2024 run for the White House once again, which he's been doing for a year or more. But there's a lot of people who are going to point fingers at Trump if Republicans don't pick up Pennsylvania because, you know, appearing with Mastriano and putting him on the same stage or platform with Dr. Oz is potentially problematic for the party because Mastriano is much further behind in his run for the gubernatorial race there and is seen much more as a hard-line candidate. FLORIDO: President Biden and former President Trump are also very unpopular. Isn't there a risk in some of these congressional candidates campaigning with them? MONTANARO: Yeah, there certainly is. It's been a bit of a mystery in some respects. And again, Trump's brand is going to be tested because he is widely unpopular with independents and, of course, Democrats. A majority of people in the country, according to polls, say that they have an unfavorable rating of Trump. In fact, in our last survey, though, Trump and Biden had the exact same number, you know, when it came to unfavorable ratings. So it's really going to be a test of both of their brands. FLORIDO: Domenico, what do we know right now about the electorate - about who's voted so far and about who is leaving their votes on the table? MONTANARO: We've seen tens of millions of votes already be cast. So we really shouldn't be talking about Tuesday as Election Day but kind of the start of the next phase of election season, perhaps, because we've had quite a bit of activity already - lots of enthusiasm across the board, the levels on all sides really pointing to record midterm turnout. You know, Republicans are slightly more enthusiastic than Democrats are. Democrats have been using abortion rights as a key motivating issue, especially for white women with college degrees and younger voters who say that's their top issue - really hoping to drive them out to the polls. I would be very cautious with - for people to not overread early voting data because Democrats are so heavily voting early, much more so than Republicans. FLORIDO: And what are the issues that are pushing people to the polls in this final stretch of the campaigns? And have those issues been changing over the course of this cycle? MONTANARO: Inflation continues to be the top concern for voters across the country - independents, Republicans, of course. And people are saying overwhelmingly that they would trust Republicans to handle inflation more so than Democrats. So that's a really big warning sign for Democrats. Crime is also an issue that's not necessarily the top issue. But for Republicans and independents, it is a key motivating issue. If you were to do sort of second-ranked issues, crime is right up there for them. So, you know, those are the two big issues that we're seeing really motivate voters on the right as Democrats are trying to push abortion rights and preserving democracy, as we heard from former President Obama. FLORIDO: What are you watching most closely in the final hours of this campaign? And what would you tell people who are wondering whether they're going to be able to go to bed on Tuesday knowing who took control of Congress? MONTANARO: It's going to be highly unlikely, if not impossible, to know who controls the Senate. I think we've got to be prepared for this to go on for days, if not weeks. That's perfectly within the rules - understandable, legal, all of that - doesn't mean that there's fraud because counting takes a while, especially in close races. The House is a different story - Republicans widely expected to retake control. They only need five seats to do that, and they're favored to do so. We probably won't know the extent or the height of a GOP wave if there is one on election night, especially because there are so many races in the West and in California that take much longer to count. And their polls close 11 p.m. Eastern time. So, you know, this is going to go on a bit, and I think people are just going to have to gird themselves for that. FLORIDO: Domenico, we mentioned former President Trump, and there have been reports that he could announce another run for president soon. He has been hinting very heavily at that. He's certainly played heavily in these elections. What are you hearing? MONTANARO: He seems very eager to announce that he's going to run in 2024. Let's take a listen to a little bit of sound of him from that same rally, talking about what the polls are showing for him in a Republican primary. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: Let's see. There it is - Trump at 71, Ron DeSanctimonious (ph) at 10%, Mike Pence at 7. Oh, Mike's doing better than I thought. MONTANARO: And if you weren't listening closely, your ears probably perked up when you just heard what Trump said there about Florida Governor Ron DeSantis. He called him Ron DeSanctimonious. So already with a new nickname for the person who's widely seen as the biggest threat to Trump to win a potential presidential nomination - so clearly, DeSantis is very much on Trump's mind. FLORIDO: Midterm voting hasn't even finished, and we're already looking ahead to 2024, it seems. Domenico Montanaro is NPR senior political editor and correspondent. Thanks, Domenico.

Gov. John Fetterman, Saturday, Nov. 5, 2022, in Philadelphia. LATROBE, Pa. \u2014 Former President Donald Trump is predicting America's destruction if his fellow Republicans don't deliver a massive electoral wave on Tuesday. Democrats, led by President Joe Biden and two other former presidents, are warning that abortion rights, Social Security and even democracy itself are at stake. Three of the six living presidents delivered dire closing messages Saturday in battleground Pennsylvania entering the final weekend of the 2022 midterm elections, but their words echoed across the country as millions of Americans cast ballots to decide the balance of power in Washington and in key state capitals. Polls across America will close on Tuesday, but more than 39 million people have already voted. On Sunday, Biden was set to campaign in suburban New York, while Trump was headed to Florida. \"If you want to stop the destruction of our country and save the American dream, then on Tuesday you must vote Republican in a giant red wave,\" Trump told thousands of cheering supporters as he campaigned Saturday in western Pennsylvania, describing the United States as \"a country in decline.\" Earlier in the day, Biden shared the stage with former President Barack Obama in Philadelphia, the former running mates campaigning together for the first time since Biden took office. In neighboring New York, even former President Bill Clinton, largely absent from national politics in recent years, was out defending his party. \"Sulking and moping is not an option,\" Obama charged. \"On Tuesday, let's make sure our country doesn't get set back 50 years.\" Not everyone, it seemed, was on message as the weekend began. Even before arriving in Pennsylvania, Biden was dealing with a fresh political mess after upsetting some in his party for promoting plans to shut down fossil fuel plants in favor of green energy. While he made the comments in California the day before, the fossil fuel industry is a major employer in Pennsylvania. Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., chair of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, said the president owed coal workers across the country an apology. He called Biden's comments \"offensive and disgusting.\" Former President Donald Trump applauds toward the crowd at the conclusion of an election rally in Latrobe, Pa., Saturday, Nov. 5, 2022.\n                \n                    \n                    Jacqueline Larma/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Former President Donald Trump applauds toward the crowd at the conclusion of an election rally in Latrobe, Pa., Saturday, Nov. 5, 2022. Trump seized on the riff in western Pennsylvania, charging that Biden \"has resumed the war on coal, your coal.\" The White House said Biden's words were \"twisted to suggest a meaning that was not intended; he regrets it if anyone hearing these remarks took offense\" and that he was \"commenting on a fact of economics and technology.\" Democrats are deeply concerned about their narrow majorities in the House and Senate as voters sour on Biden's leadership amid surging inflation, crime concerns and widespread pessimism about the direction of the country. History suggests that Democrats, as the party in power, will suffer significant losses in the midterms. Trump peeked ahead toward Florida as he campaigned in Pennsylvania, slapping at the state's Republican governor, Ron DeSantis. After displaying recent presidential poll numbers on the big screens, Trump called DeSantis, a potential 2024 GOP rival, \"Ron DeSanctimonious.\" Trump's weekend travels were part of a late blitz that will also take him to Ohio. He's hoping a strong GOP showing on Tuesday will generate momentum for the 2024 run that he's expected to launch in the days or weeks after polls close. Over and over on Saturday, Trump falsely claimed he lost the 2020 election only because Democrats cheated, while raising the possibility of election fraud this coming week. In part, because of such rhetoric, federal intelligence agencies have warned of the possibility of political violence from far-right extremists in the coming days. \"Everybody, I promise you, in the very next \u2014 very, very, very short period of time, you're going to be happy,\" Trump said of another White House bid. \"But first we have to win an historic victory for Republicans on Nov. 8.\" Biden's Pennsylvania address was largely the same he has been giving for weeks \u2014 spotlighting a grab bag of his major legislative achievements, while warning that abortion rights, voting rights, Social Security and Medicare are at risk should Republicans take control of Congress. The president highlighted the Inflation Reduction Action, passed in August by the Democratic-led Congress, which includes several health care provisions popular among older adults and the less well-off, including a $2,000 cap on out-of-pocket medical expenses and a $35 monthly cap per prescription on insulin. The new law also requires companies that raise prices faster than overall inflation to pay Medicare a rebate. But with a bigger and more energetic audience in his home state, Biden's energy seemed lifted. \"We have to reaffirm the values that have long defined us,\" Biden said of threats to democracy. \"We are good people. I know this.\" He added: \"Get out and vote!\"",

            "article_content": "NPR's Scott Simon talks with Douglas Keith of the Brennan Center for Justice about why money is pouring into state judicial campaigns.  SCOTT SIMON, HOST: Congressional and gubernatorial campaigns get a lot of attention during midterm elections, and of course, they raise a lot of money. But this year, state judicial races have also attracted a lot of donations. Why? Douglas Keith is an attorney at the Brennan Center for Justice, and he joins us now. Thanks so much for being with us. DOUGLAS KEITH: Thanks for having me. SIMON: Almost $100 million, we're told, was funneled into state Supreme Court campaigns in 2020. Any reason to think that's lower this year and what's attracting interest? KEITH: Well, this year, the spotlight on state Supreme Courts is brighter than it has ever been. And that's in big part the result of U.S. Supreme Court decisions in which the court has essentially punted big questions to the state courts. So on things from abortion to redistricting, questions that folks may be used to being decided by the U.S. Supreme Court, it'll be state Supreme Courts that are asked whether state law or the state constitution protects particular rights or democratic institutions. SIMON: Illinois, North Carolina and Ohio - a lot of spending there. KEITH: The one thing we can look to predict whether a state Supreme Court election is going to attract a lot of money and attention is whether the partisan or ideological majority on that court is up for grabs. And those three states, the majority will be decided by this election. And in each of those three states, there have been high-profile rulings recently that are attracting a lot of attention and a lot of interest in who is going to control a majority on those courts. SIMON: Mr. Keith, is this necessarily bad? I mean, isn't this just democracy and a reflection of public interest? KEITH: So judicial elections were adopted, you know, a century or more ago in some states as a reform tactic. The idea was judges were being picked behind closed doors and smoke-filled rooms, and elections were supposed to add transparency to the process, bring them out into the sunshine. But the way this money is coming in to judicial elections today does nothing for transparency. A lot of the money in some states, more than half, more than 75% of all the money that will come in, comes from super PACs and other opaque groups that don't tell voters where their money's coming from. And so voters can't assess who's trying to sway their votes or who's trying to influence who sits on their courts. Voters don't know when their judges have major conflicts of interest. SIMON: Well, you mentioned major conflicts of interest. Could that be a company that can anticipate having business before the court? KEITH: Absolutely. One of the big groups of spenders that we see in judicial elections is businesses that know how important these courts are to their bottom lines. And so they try and influence who sits on the courts so those courts will be more friendly to them when they or their peers come before the court. Now, these groups are also very good at hiding their identity from voters. And so even if they're getting involved in judicial elections, to that extent, voters may never know. SIMON: As you note, an elective judiciary came into being as a reform idea. Is what's beginning to happen, does that renew an argument for an appointive judiciary? KEITH: There are absolutely better systems of picking judges than the way modern judicial elections are operating. There are states that use commissions with broad, diverse sets of voices from across the state to vet and recommend judges for appointment by governors. There's also the option for states, even if they keep elections, to only elect judges to single lengthy terms. So once they're on the bench, they're no longer subject to these political pressures that research shows can actually influence their decision-making. SIMON: I mean, I remember going in to vote in Illinois, and there was, you know, a huge list of judges to vote for or against. And, forgive me, the only way I would know their names, and I was a crime reporter, is if I'd been in their courtroom or if they'd been indicted for something themselves. KEITH: This is another important feature of judicial elections for everyone to be aware of. While these elections are held, often the public has very, very little information about who these judges are. And that's part of the spending story, too. Lots of these groups, they will spend millions in a judicial election race or even, you know, half a million dollars, which it can look small when you compare it to a Senate race that's happening at the same time. But because voters know so little, because there's so little news about these races, there's a pretty small price tag to have a pretty big influence on these elections. And these sophisticated political groups, they know that. SIMON: Douglas Keith of the Brennan Center for Justice, thanks so much. KEITH: Thanks so much for having me. Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.

NPR political correspondent Susan Davis joins us now. Sue, thanks so much for being with us. SUSAN DAVIS, BYLINE: Good morning, Scott. SIMON: Election Day - not what it used to be. More like election season, right? DAVIS: Yeah. SIMON: ...'Cause voters have been voting for weeks now. How does this change the way the country might think about elections? DAVIS: Well, over 30 million Americans have already voted. We don't know how they voted, but it does tell us that more and more Americans like having options when it comes to how they cast their ballot. It's one change the pandemic sort of forced on the country in 2020 but is really becoming more of the norm. There are things that are generally true about early voting. Democrats like it more than Republicans. Republicans historically still like to show up on Election Day. And forces inside the party, like former President Trump, continue to cast unfounded doubts about the security of mail-in ballots. Our most recent NPR-PBS-Marist College poll showed about 55% of people say that they've either already voted or will do so before Election Day. And Democrats, by a 2-to-1 margin over Republicans, say they've already voted. A bit of caution here - that means you need to be a little careful when you're interpreting these early vote numbers. They are heavily skewed towards Democrats. It also means you need to be patient. With so many more mail ballots coming in, it takes states a lot longer to count the vote. And states like New York and California say final results could not be known for weeks. SIMON: I'm glad you mentioned our polling because it also shows where voter enthusiasm seems to be strongest and where it might be lacking. Republicans might have a lot to hope for on election night. What did we learn from this final snapshot of numbers of the electorate before Nov. 8th? DAVIS: Well, the voters who typically align with the Republican Party are very enthusiastic. We're talking about Trump voters. Rural voters and older voters are all at the top of the list while Black voters, Latinos and young voters - way at the bottom. Just one example of how big this gap is - 87% of people in the baby-boomer generation say they are very interested in the election, which means they're almost certainly going to vote, versus just 52% of Gen Z and millennials. So this is one of these big, red flashing signs for Democrats. The one group in their base - white women with college degrees do appear to be very fired up, and they are a very critical portion of the Democratic base. But these other pillars just are not excited. SIMON: It's certainly not a role to try and predict outcomes, but history would suggest this could be a difficult election for Democrats. DAVIS: Sure. And, I mean, there are a lot of things that have made this midterm unique. Obviously, the Supreme Court ruling, throwing out precedent on abortion rights. Republicans, particularly in the Senate, have had not the greatest recruitment year for their candidates. But the fundamentals of a midterm election is that it's a referendum on the party in power. And President Biden's approval rating is really low. It's in the high 30s or low 40s depending on the state. Voters consistently say the economy is the No. 1 issue on their mind, and that is an issue that voters tend to lean on Republican candidates when they're not feeling economically secure. And you're right, we're not prognosticators, but we talk to them all the time. One House Republican strategist told NPR just yesterday that they think their floor is 20 seats to gain in the House. Republicans need just five to take over the chamber. When it comes to the Senate, it's a jump ball. It's a 50-50 Senate now. It's unlikely either party is going to have a bigger than a 51-seat majority. And these races are really tight. It's really coming down to three races in Pennsylvania, Nevada and Georgia. I think the bottom line for the Biden administration is they are very likely looking at divided government for the final two years of his first term. And these are likely to be much more combative and much less productive years with Capitol Hill. SIMON: NPR political correspondent Susan Davis, thanks so much for being with us.

Behan Elementary on Nov. 2, 2021 in the Clinton Hill neighborhood of the Brooklyn borough in New York City. Election Day is almost here! Well, almost. Tens of millions have already voted, and the election is likely to extend beyond Tuesday for days, if not weeks. Several races, especially in the Senate, are expected to be razor tight and control of the chamber may not be known for a while. Here are five questions to help you think about this next phase of election season. It seemed for a while \u2014 from late June after the Dobbs decision overturning Roe through September \u2014 that Democrats might defy political gravity and not suffer the kinds of losses that are so typical for the president's party in his first midterm. But in the past few weeks, much of the available data show things moving back in Republicans' direction. Concerns over inflation and the economy continue to top voters' concerns, and Democratic enthusiasm numbers are lagging behind GOP pillar groups. That said, Democratic Senate candidates are still locked in neck-and-neck races with their GOP opponents. So no one really knows what's going to happen with the Senate exactly \u2014 and don't believe anyone who seems to think they do. Republicans are very likely to take control of the House \u2014 they only need to flip five seats, and after redistricting they're already favored in seven (seats that are deemed likely or solid Republican), according to the Cook Political Report. Cook, which attempts to forecast these things, has upped their projection from 10-20 seats to 12-25.Those margins are going to be key for whether Democrats can live to fight another cycle. The presidential election of 2024 is going to be intense, and the Senate landscape is even more favorable to Republicans that year. Democrats, of course, have an even-money chance of winning the presidency again in 2024 (remember, you can't draw anything from midterms about what it might mean for a presidential). But if a Republican does win the White House, Democrats' best hope of blunting a potential GOP president's agenda will likely be through the House. So they need to keep those losses to a minimum in these key, close House races to have a shot at doing that. A lot of this really depends on whether key Democratic groups show up to vote \u2014 or not. There has never been a greater turnout machine for Democrats than Trump. Sure, Trump fires up his base, but he also fires up Democrats. Progressives and younger voters were never thrilled with President Biden, but they voted for him to oust Trump from office. This is the first election post-Trump, and while he's played a prominent role in these elections and many of the candidates running are running in Trump's image, Democratic base voter group enthusiasm is down across the board \u2014 young voters, Black voters, Latinos \u2014 with the exception of white women with college degrees, who list abortion as their top voting issue. Gen Z/Millennial voters also list abortion rights as their top voting concern, according to the latest NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll, and it's clear Democratic activists are trying to use that to get them to the polls. But they are the group with the lowest level of interest in these elections. That's not atypical for a midterm election, but the gap between older voters and younger voters in the survey are exceedingly wide \u2014 35 points. Democrats likely need youth voter turnout to be around 30% to do well, but that's likely going to be tough. Black voters are going to be key in tight Senate races, like Pennsylvania, Georgia and North Carolina, while Latinos are going to be key in Nevada (as will Asian American voters) and Arizona. But each of those latter groups list inflation and the cost of living as their top concern. It's no secret that Republicans have fielded in the Senate some ... challenging candidates. Trump boosted Herschel Walker in Georgia and Dr. Mehmet Oz in Pennsylvania, as well as J.D. Vance in Ohio and Ted Budd in North Carolina. And Don Bolduc in New Hampshire, it's safe to say, is not the strongest candidate Republicans could have put forward. Oz's and Walker's races are going to be key because for Democrats to hold the Senate, they're going to need to win three of four of Pennsylvania, Georgia, Arizona and Nevada. It's going to be a real test of the strength of party identification, which we know is pretty darn strong, and, more importantly, the strength of Trump's brand in purple states. With this environment, Democrats are only in these races because of the lagging performances of these Trump candidates. He continues to be unpopular with a majority of Americans, and if Democrats hold the Senate because candidates in his image lose, there will be lots of finger-pointing in Trump's direction, even though he will claim credit regardless \u2014 and as people close to him are strongly suggesting he will announce a presidential run shortly after the midterms. Again, think of this as Election Season, not Election Day. It's possible, if not likely, the Georgia Senate race, for example, goes to a Dec. 6 runoff. There's a Libertarian on the ballot, where lots of protest votes could go and keep either Walker or Democratic incumbent Raphael Warnock below 50%, which is needed to avoid a runoff. There have been eyebrows raised about people with arms at voting places; voting rules and access have changed in a lot of places; and people are expected to vote by mail in bigger numbers than in any midterm in history. There is just going to be a lot of confusion on election night about vote numbers, where they are coming from, what shifts look like in favor of one party or another in multiple states. This is all expected and not nefarious, but you can expect that some, if not many of the election-denying candidates or running and perpetuating Trump's election lies will test things out and not concede elections they lost. How widespread that will be is anyone's guess \u2014 but we are clearly in a new era of U.S. elections that is very uncertain.",

Voters in a number of states this midterm cycle are being presented with a stark choice: Do they want someone who denies the legitimacy of the 2020 election to oversee voting in their state? In a different political universe, that might seem outlandish, considering hand-count audits of paper ballots and court challenges found the 2020 election to have been one of the most accurate and accessible in American history. But in 2022, trust in elections has eroded considerably among conservative-leaning voters, sending Republican candidates to follow their lead. It's a trend that has many election officials \u2014 and democracy experts \u2014 sounding the alarm. \"The fate of democracy really hinges on whether or not losers accept defeat and whether they recognize losses as losses,\" said Amel Ahmed, a political science professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. \"If you have a worldview where every loss amounts to the other side cheating ... that just generally presents a challenge for the viability of democracy.\" Election deniers have used the false narrative that the 2020 election was stolen as justification to strip back voting access measures like ballot drop boxes and other forms of early voting, and to question certain election security tools like the Electronic Registration Information Center, or ERIC. In addition to the practical voting changes an election-denying voting official could implement, Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, a Democrat, said she worries about the potential for a disruption in the election certification process in 2024 and the misinformation problems it could present if an election denier is in a position of authority and able to make lies about voting seem more credible. \"We're very much in the midst of a national effort to discredit our elections,\" Benson said at a press briefing Thursday. \"There will be people who choose to be politicians first and election administrators second or not at all.\" In her reelection campaign this fall, Benson is facing Kristina Karamo, a community college professor who rose to prominence after falsely claiming she saw election fraud in Detroit in the last presidential race. Their matchup is one of the down-ballot races to watch this week when it comes to democracy and the oversight of U.S. voting. In a state that went for Joe Biden in 2020 by more than 150,000 votes, Michigan Republicans still decided to double down with their base voters in choosing candidates for secretary of state and attorney general. Both Karamo, who has already filed a lawsuit this year based on conspiracy theories about mail voting, and Matthew DePerno, the GOP's attorney general nominee, were endorsed by former President Donald Trump. DePerno is under investigation for an alleged plot to seize and tamper with voting machines, and Karamo has come under scrutiny for her connections to the QAnon movement and her past comments, including an opposition to teaching evolution in schools. \"Evolution is one of the biggest frauds that have been perpetrated on us,\" she said in a July 2019 video, according to CNN. While both candidates garnered the majority support of party loyalists at a spring nominating convention, even then more mainstream Republicans worried about the candidates' viability in a general election in a purple state. \"Every ad from [now] through November is going to say 'QAnon Karamo is too crazy for us,' \" state Rep. Beau LaFave, a Republican who ran for secretary of state against Karamo, said at the time. DePerno is facing current Attorney General Dana Nessel, who was first elected in 2018, and who has made headlines for refusing to enforce Michigan's anti-abortion law. Nessel was the first LGBTQ person elected to statewide office in Michigan, and Republicans including DePerno have sought to attack her using culture war tropes. They have seized on a joke she made at a press conference over the summer that there should be a \"drag queen for every school.\" Benson was also first elected in 2018, after losing her initial bid for the office in 2010. She is the former dean of Wayne State University law school, and the author of a book about the role of secretaries of state in American democracy. Benson was the subject of intense scrutiny around the 2020 election, due in large part to unfounded accusations about Michigan's elections system by Trump, but she is well respected in the elections community and has long prided herself on working closely with the Republican (and Trump-endorsed) secretary of state of Ohio, Frank LaRose. In many ways, Arizona has been the epicenter of election denialism since 2020. Shortly after voting ended in that election, one of the more famous vote-counting conspiracies, dubbed \"SharpieGate,\" bloomed in Maricopa County, Ariz. Half a year later, the Cyber Ninjas began their widely discredited \"audit\" of the vote in Maricopa (which also confirmed that Biden won). And now Republicans who deny the 2020 election results are running for each of the statewide offices that has a role in administering elections. That has many worried about the future of voting in the state, should they win. Former President Barack Obama rallied on behalf of the Democrats in the state on Wednesday night in Phoenix, warning that \"democracy as we know it may not survive\" if Republicans sweep those offices. The secretary of state race pits a former elections administrator, Adrian Fontes, against a far-right candidate, Mark Finchem, who is a self-proclaimed member of the far-right Oath Keepers and who was at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 when rioters disrupted the certification of Biden's win. In an interview with NPR earlier this year, Finchem said he did not go inside the Capitol that day but also continued to claim that the 2020 election was stolen. Trump endorsed Finchem last September, and has also endorsed the other election denying-candidates in the Arizona contests for governor and Senate. In the governor's race, election denier Kari Lake, who has already filed a dismissed lawsuit that was premised in voting misinformation, is facing the current secretary of state, Katie Hobbs. The Silver State may be the most under-the-radar state when it comes to election denial, but a movement in rural counties toward ballot hand-counts shows that voting misinformation is taking hold here as well. Polls also show the race for chief voting official to be neck and neck, despite a substantial fundraising lead for the non-election denying candidate, Democrat Cisco Aguilar. Aguilar is an attorney who spent a number of years on the state's Athletic Commission, and he says his first priority in office would be to lobby the legislature in Nevada to make it a felony to harass or intimidate election workers. His opponent, Republican Jim Marchant, is a former member of the state Assembly who blames his loss in 2020 on election fraud, though he has not produced any evidence of that. Marchant has Trump's endorsement, and at a recent rally in Minden, Nev., he noted their similar views. \"We have something in common: President Trump and I lost an election in 2020 because of a rigged election,\" Marchant said. \"I've been working since Nov. 4, 2020, to expose what happened, and what I found out is horrifying.\" Marchant, Karamo and Finchem all say they want to significantly curtail early voting, and Marchant has been a leading proponent of the local movement back toward hand-counting ballots, even though that counting style has been found time and again to be less accurate and more resource-intensive.",

Kemp smiles as Pence touts the governor's leadership during a rally in Cumming, Ga., on Nov. 1. \"I'm here because Brian Kemp is singularly one of the most successful conservative governors in the United States of America,\" Pence told the crowd. \"I'm here because Stacey Abrams can never be governor of the great state of Georgia.\"\n                \n                    \n                    Riley Bunch/GPB\n                    \n                \nhide caption On the campaign trail, Kemp doesn't talk much about the fallout from the 2020 election, nor last year's overhaul of Georgia's voting laws that Democrats have roundly criticized.

As governor, Kemp signed a law banning most abortions after about six weeks. Abrams at a rally in Marietta, Ga., on Nov. 1. She has argued Georgia's $6.6 billion surplus should be used to bolster state services like affordable housing programs, schools and health care. \"We need a governor who knows that it's not enough to say you know there's a problem,\" she said. \"We've got to have a governor willing to invest in the answer.\"\n                \n                    \n                    Riley Bunch/GPB\n                    \n                \nhide caption \"Governors have the greatest amount of power that people rarely understand,\" Abrams said in an interview. \"But because of the U.S. Supreme Court stripping women of their right to choose, because of the weakening of the Voting Rights Act, more and more of the power to make decisions is being relegated to the states.\" Still, an issue that may help decide tight races in Georgia and other states is mostly out of governors' hands \u2013 inflation. Kemp and other Republicans have tied rising costs for everyday expenses like groceries and gas to Democrats' control in Washington. Abrams stands with protestors outside of the closed Wellstar Atlanta Medical Center on Nov. 1. Since 2018, Abrams has advocated for full Medicaid expansion and argued it would have saved many of Georgia's closing hospitals. \"We are steps away from M.L.K.'s home and yet we are watching this community lose health care in real time,\" she said.\n                \n                    \n                    Riley Bunch/GPB\n                    \n                \nhide caption In front of a crowd of supporters in Marietta, Ga., and flanked by U.S. Sen.

For example, Kemp has kept the state's gas tax suspended for months now. Abrams has redoubled her pledge to expand Medicaid. In the final stretch to Election Day, Georgia Democrats called in high-profile surrogates. Former President Barack Obama stumped for Abrams and U.S. Sen. Raphael Warnock in College Park, Ga. on Oct. 28. \"There may be a lot of issues at stake in this election,\" he said. \"But the basic question, fundamental question that you should be asking yourself right now is, who will fight for you?\"\n                \n                    \n                    Riley Bunch/GPB\n                    \n                \nhide caption In recent months, Kemp has led Abrams in most polls by several points. But as the two candidates top midterm ballots in Georgia for a second time, they have laid out very different visions for the state \u2013 on everything from economic development and the state budget to healthcare, voting and public safety \u2013 at a time when Georgia's demographics and politics are in flux. So the outcome of Georgia's gubernatorial race is likely to both shape the everyday lives of voters \u2013 and the trajectory of their state.

At the time, she was a mother of two young children. \"Men don't get asked that question. Men are praised if they bring their children with them,\" Grechen Shirley said. \"But when a woman shows up with her child, she's immediately looked at as somebody who is not fully dedicated to the cause, and who does not have the time to run.\" She lost in the general election to Peter King in 2018, but found a new mission. In the years since that race, Grechen Shirley created Vote Mama Foundation and the Vote Mama PAC, organizations dedicated to getting mothers, specifically Democrats, elected to public office. \"It's critical that we are also teaching our children that running for office is just what moms do, that they should be civically engaged, that it's fun, and that it's easy,\" Grechen Shirley said. It's a message that's hard to get into the minds of women even now in 2022. This year, there are a record number of women who are nominees in races for governor and state legislatures, according to the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University. Women \u2014 even more so those with young children \u2014 are still in the minority, Vote Mama's research shows. This is despite the proven political power of mothers, University of Virginia a politics professor Jennifer Lawless said. Only 5.3% of all state legislators across the country are women with children under the age of 18 at home, according to Vote Mama. And only 7% of members of Congress are moms of minor children. In comparison, nearly 18% of people in the U.S. are mothers with kids under 18. Liuba Grechen Shirley, who ran for Congress in 2018, later created the Vote Mama Foundation and other advocacy arms of the group to push more mothers to run for public office.\n                \n                    \n                    Kevin Hagen/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Liuba Grechen Shirley, who ran for Congress in 2018, later created the Vote Mama Foundation and other advocacy arms of the group to push more mothers to run for public office. Mothers, though not a monolith, have the power to sway elections, Lawless said. Over the years women have notably used the \"mom\" moniker to their advantage. For example, Sarah Palin coined the phrase \"hockey moms\" in 2008, which fired up a certain demographic, Lawless notes. When U.S. Sen. Patty Murray got into politics she used \"just a mom in tennis shoes\" to her advantage. \"That sort of made a lot of women who had children, who hadn't necessarily thought of themselves as politically active, interested in running,\" Lawless said of Murray. Research shows that women have voted at higher rates than men in every midterm and presidential election since 1984. \"If you look back at election cycles, over the last few decades, it's often been these suburban women who are pivotal in terms of either delivering a victory to the Democrats or the Republicans. So it's not unusual to try and get them to be politically involved, because it could potentially help each side. It depends what issues are on the agenda,\" Lawless said of Vote Mama's effort. Grechen Shirley says she wants to use this political power to get mothers volunteering for local elections, to work with campaigns, and to advocate for family friendly policy change in Washington. To make that happen, the organization expanded this year to establish Vote Mama Lobby. This works as the advocacy arm of the Vote Mama Foundation. With its website and app, it aims to connect members to mobilize in local, state and federal races. The goal is to get 100,000 members to help elect Democrats and Vote Mama PAC-endorsed candidates by the 2024 election cycle.

Sarah Palin speaks in 2008. Lawless says she is reluctant to say that the parental status or family responsibilities of a candidate are what's keeping women out of the political arena. In her work, she's found that when women with children run, they do just as well getting elected as women who don't have children. Still many women in general believe they are under qualified to run, Lawless said citing her research on this topic. \"Men are still significantly more likely than women to receive the suggestion to run from anyone. And that means from party leaders and elected officials, but also from family members, colleagues and friends,\" she said. Things are changing, though, as this year's data on female electoral involvement shows. \"I think we're seeing candidates embrace their parental roles and make the case that it's because they have children and because they're mothers, that they have unique experiences that position them to better represent a large portion of their constituents,\" Lawless said. Sen. Tammy Duckworth became the first U.S. senator to give birth while in office in 2018. She's said becoming a parent has made her more committed to her job in Congress. \"Parenthood isn't just a women's issue, it's an economic issue and one that affects all parents \u2014 men and women alike,\" Duckworth said at the time. \"As tough as juggling the demands of motherhood and being a Senator can be, I'm hardly alone or unique as a working parent, and my children only make me more committed to doing my job and standing up for hardworking families everywhere.\" Following the birth of her first daughter, when the lawmaker served in the House, Duckworth's policy focus promoted measures supporting child care and maternal health. This is exactly what Grechen Shirley hopes to get across with Vote Mama. The organization wants to support candidates that can advocate for increased child care investments and paid parental leave in the U.S. \u2014 both issues seen as major obstacles for women to succeed economically and professionally. \"I voted early\" stickers are seen at a polling station on Oct. 25 in Milwaukee.\n                \n                    \n                    Morry Gash/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption \"I voted early\" stickers are seen at a polling station on Oct. 25 in Milwaukee. The 2022 midterms may be an interesting test on the power of voting moms. The impact of the dissolution of abortion rights in dozens of states and the struggling economy will play a factor. This year, \"what's particularly interesting is that there are a group of mothers who are incredibly mobilized around issues regarding reproductive rights,\" Lawless said. \"But these moms are also traditionally very interested in the economy and being able to put food on the table and generating economic security for their families,\" On protecting reproductive rights, Democrats have a bigger advantage. On the economy, Republicans do, she said. \"It's really going to come down to which side is able to better mobilize and generate enthusiasm among these women who have kids and who are living in districts where they really are pivotal,\" Lawless said.",

            "article_content": "NPR's Juana Summers talks with Terrance Woodbury, a Democratic pollster who rungs the polling firm HIT Strategies, about Black male voter engagement.  JUANA SUMMERS, HOST: With just days to go before voting ends in the 2022 midterms, the latest NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll is showing some warning signs for Democrats, specifically when it comes to who's more keen to vote this year. Across age, race, income, gender and other demographic groups, the survey shows Black voters are among the least enthusiastic to vote. And Black voters have historically voted for Democrats at a higher rate, with Black women among the most reliable Democratic voters. Now, we probably don't have to remind you - like with any voting bloc, there is still a vast array of diverging opinions, ideologies and issues that are important among Black voters. AL HEARTLEY: It really comes down to abortion rights as well as voting rights. SUMMERS: And that's why Al Heartley, a consultant in Smyrna, Ga., says he's voting for Democrat Stacey Abrams in his state's closely watched race for governor and incumbent Democrat Raphael Warnock for U.S. Senate. And Heartley says his experiences as a Black man in this country should matter to politicians. HEARTLEY: Black men have a voice and have a perspective. You have to acknowledge where I am as a Black person first. To me, that's what Warnock and Abrams really do. SUMMERS: Relatability also matters to Donell Brunson, a voter in Fairless Hills, Pa., another state with a high-profile Senate race. DONELL BRUNSON: Fetterman is like a everyday-looking guy. I like my politicians more, you know, of the people. SUMMERS: Even though he's supporting Democrat John Fetterman over Republican candidate Mehmet Oz, Brunson doesn't feel like politicians across the country understand what it takes to win support from more Black men. BRUNSON: It's clear to me that they don't have people of color advising them. They're assuming what we want. And we want the same things that other voters want - jobs, economics, education. SUMMERS: Here to talk with us more about efforts to mobilize Black men in this year's midterms is Terrance Woodbury. He's a Democratic pollster and runs HIT Strategies, a polling firm that specializes in understanding young and minority voters. Terrance, welcome to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. TERRANCE WOODBURY: Thank you so much for having me. SUMMERS: Thanks for being here. So what are the historic trends you've seen with voter engagement among Black men? WOODBURY: While there is a gender gap between Black men and Black women, it's important to point out that that gender gap is not unique to Black voters, that there is, in fact, a gender gap across all races, that white men and Black men, Latino men and AAPI men all vote a little more conservatively than their female counterparts. What's unique about Black male voters is that they were Democratic voters. They were supporting Barack Obama at 90%-plus margins. And so now that we have seen that decline to 79% or 80%, it is, in fact, enough to make the margin of difference in states like Georgia and Wisconsin and North Carolina, where they have diverse candidates at the top of the ticket. SUMMERS: Earlier, we heard from that Pennsylvania voter Donell Brunson, who said that so many candidates just make assumptions about what Black men want. Based on your data, what issues would you say candidates from either party should focus on to close that enthusiasm gap, particularly when it comes to Black men? WOODBURY: What we've found is that while this election cycle is being defined by Democrats, by the threat of the other side, the threat of losing democracy, that in fact, Black men are more motivated by the progress that Democrats have made. For example, when we asked them in a recent poll, 73% of Black men said that their lives had not improved since Joe Biden became president. But when we gave them a list of progress, of policies - the child tax credit, the George Floyd executive order, the infrastructure bill - 90% of Black men said that that progress would improve their lives. And so it's clear to me that we're dealing with a messaging problem in connecting Black men to the progress that's being made. SUMMERS: I want to push back a little bit here because I think that a number of the issues that you talked about, progress has a long way to go. You mentioned the executive order which bans chokeholds and no-knock warrants, but Congress has failed to act significantly on police reform. There has been lagging progress on infrastructure. I guess I would love to know your take on those who say there's still quite a long way to go. WOODBURY: Absolutely. I was in focus groups in Michigan just a few weeks ago, and a Black man reminded me that policy is not progress. And there's a process in place to rip up lead pipes, but his baby is still drinking dirty water, and that's not progress for him, right? When we needed Black men's votes, we delivered to the palm of their hand. Click here to access your mail-in ballot. Click here to find your polling place. Well, now they need to click here to see a map of those lead pipes and the progress map of every pipe that's been replaced. They want to see and be a part of that progress in order to know that it's real and know that it's affecting the communities that they care about. SUMMERS: I'm hoping you can talk to us a little bit about the more specific fears or even barriers for Black voters here. I find myself wondering how changes to voting laws, more recent reports of voter intimidation in some states or other political factors come into play. WOODBURY: Yeah, that is what is the single greatest concern to me going into this election. It is the changing access to voting - lines getting longer, being asked for more or different identification every time they go vote. It is up to us to communicate. This is the goal of these efforts - not to disenfranchise the entire Black community, but to create just enough friction that just enough Black voters turn around and go home. You know, in a recent BlackTrack poll that we conducted just last week amongst a thousand Black voters nationally, a majority, 51%, expect there to be political violence if Republicans lose this election. And a third, 33%, expect there to be political violence regardless of who wins this election. We cannot normalize that. Even the presence of ballistic gear and weapons at polling places continues to introduce violence into our body politic. And that was just not a hallmark of our democracy and our peaceful transfer of power. SUMMERS: The White House might also be hearing the alarm bells on Black voter turnout. President Biden made this appeal on Tuesday in a conversation with radio host Rickey Smiley, who has a majority Black audience. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Vote. Vote. Vote. Vote. It's important. Democracy is literally at stake here. SUMMERS: And, Terrance, party leaders can urge voting all they want. But where do you see the onus on them, Democrats or Republicans, to be in the driver's seat here to push more engagement? WOODBURY: Yeah, this is a part of where I would argue that there's a - that the White House has a messaging problem and not a governing problem. It's that they have to position Black voters as the hero of that story. We didn't reduce child poverty in the Black community because of the benevolence of Joe Biden or of Democrats. We did it because Black voters won the U.S. Senate in Georgia. And so when we start to point to the progress, it's important that we give voters credit for that progress and make them the heroes of the story. SUMMERS: Terrance Woodbury, Democratic pollster and CEO of HIT Strategies. Thank you so much for your time and insights. WOODBURY: Thank you so much. I'll come back anytime.

            "article_content": "President Biden gave an 11th hour pitch to voters on threats to democracy ahead of the midterm elections, using the backdrop of the Capitol to make his case.  RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: In the final days of the midterm election season, President Biden is warning about the state of democracy. In a speech last night near the U.S. Capitol, Biden said there were about 300 candidates running this year who say that they do not accept the fact that Donald Trump lost the election in 2020. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: The president also talked about political violence. He referred to a man who broke into the home of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi last week. The man attacked her husband, Paul Pelosi, and later told police he had a plan to send a message to Democrats. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: We don't settle our differences, America, with a riot, a mob or a bullet or a hammer. We settle them peaceably at the ballot box. MARTIN: NPR political reporter Deepa Shivaram joins us to talk through all these things. Good morning, Deepa. DEEPA SHIVARAM, BYLINE: Good morning. MARTIN: So the White House had billed this speech by the president as an address on democracy. It was interesting to me that of all the places he could have chose to begin, he started the address by recounting that attack on Nancy Pelosi's husband. SHIVARAM: Yeah, that is how the president started off his speech. And he didn't shy away from going into the details. He talked about how this man who broke into Nancy Pelosi's home and attacked her husband with a hammer was asking, where's Nancy? And he compared it to the January 6 insurrectionists who stormed the Capitol in 2021 and asked the same question. Biden talked about how there's been a rise in political violence against Democrats and Republicans and nonpartisan election workers in the aftermath of the 2020 election. And it's put democracy in a really fragile state. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BIDEN: We must, with one overwhelming unified voice, speak as a country and say there's no place - no place - for voter intimidation or political violence in America, whether it's directed at Democrats or Republicans. No place, period. No place ever. SHIVARAM: And Biden said that he knows there are worries over the economy and health care, but that the state of democracy is really fragile right now, and it's also at stake in this election. MARTIN: So there's less than a week of voting before voting wraps up. Millions of Americans have already done so. So if he was trying to gin up support from his base, was this a little late in the game? SHIVARAM: Yeah, that's a fair question. You know, Biden made it clear in his speech that he was trying to reach all Americans. But you have to keep in mind that this was a political speech. It was an event with the Democratic National Committee, not an address from the White House or on Capitol Hill, though the location was near the U.S. Capitol. And with voting ending on Tuesday, there's definitely a push needed from Democrats to try and motivate some of their voters who haven't been engaged yet with the election or were not planning to get engaged. A number of polls show that voters are concerned about inflation and abortion, but there is also a high concern among Democratic voters about the state of democracy, especially when it comes to protecting the right to vote. But the level of enthusiasm among Democratic voters is far below their Republican counterparts. And according to an NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll that we released yesterday, that came up. And in this final push towards Tuesday, Democrats need to ramp up their base, especially in these states where some of these election deniers are running for office, like Nevada, Arizona and Wisconsin. MARTIN: So President Biden gave this address near the U.S. Capitol - of course, the site of the January 6 insurrection. Did Biden go so far as to bring up the name of former President Trump in his remarks? SHIVARAM: So he didn't mention Trump by name, but he did say that the former president and his big lie have fueled more election deniers like, he mentioned, the hundreds who are running for office this year. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BIDEN: American democracy is under attack because the defeated former president of the United States refuses to accept the results of the 2020 election. He refuses to accept the will of the people. He refuses to accept the fact that he lost. SHIVARAM: And Biden went beyond Trump too. He said that these MAGA Republicans have emboldened violence and intimidation of voters and election officials. He called it corrosive and destructive. And he did say that he thinks these Republicans are the minority of the party, but he said they were a driving force, and he called them loud and determined. MARTIN: Deepa Shivaram, thank you so much for your reporting. SHIVARAM: Thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Federal officials have warned about violence erupting after this year's election, with experts particularly concerned about the period after Nov. 8. As Election Day nears, the recent attack on Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's husband in their San Francisco home is increasing concerns over political violence around the midterms. Those concerns were further emphasized by the release of an internal bulletin within federal agencies \u2014 on the same day as the Pelosi attack \u2014 warning of a heightened threat from domestic violent extremists in the coming weeks. While troubling indicators \u2014 such as growing support for political violence, a rise in threats against elected officials and election workers, and the Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol \u2014 have clearly signaled the path of the country's political environment over the past two years, many see the current election cycle as a crucial test of how much those factors will affect the practice of democracy in the United States. While the internal bulletin warned federal agencies of a heightened threat period, it identified \"lone offenders\" as the most likely to commit violence, rather than organized extremist groups. It outlined a number of grievances that may motivate those actors, including debunked claims of widespread election fraud and polarizing social topics such as abortion and LGBTQ rights. But the alert did not indicate that federal law enforcement is aware, at this time, of any specific plans for coordinated or targeted violence. \"It aligns very much with our own monitoring ... that there is concerning activity, concerning rhetoric out there,\" said Shannon Hiller, executive director of the Bridging Divides Initiative at Princeton University, which works to track and mitigate political violence. \"But we're not concerned about safety and security on Election Day.\" Hiller said she remains confident that on Tuesday, voters should be able to go to their polling places without fear. \"If we look back to 2020, we saw very little violence around Election Day itself,\" she said. \"There was lots of preparation and has been even more preparation by government, non-government groups to ensure that that's the case this year again.\" A woman watches a ballot drop box while sitting in a parking lot in Mesa, Ariz., on Oct. 24.

The monitoring of drop boxes has raised concerns of voter intimidation. Still, early voting in some places has been fraught. In Arizona, armed civilians in tactical gear showed up at ballot drop boxes, ostensibly to monitor voters. The activities, which prompted claims of voter intimidation, have been encouraged by Republicans across the country since 2020. One of them is Mark Finchem, the GOP nominee for Arizona secretary of state who has spread baseless claims of election fraud and who has encouraged his followers to monitor vote operations in their communities. \"You are responsible for maintaining your election \u2014 not me, you!\" Finchem said at a rally last year, which began with those in attendance pledging allegiance to a flag that was at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6. \"You need to be at the polls. You cannot leave this to someone else.\" Those \"citizen oversight\" efforts are expected to extend to in-person voting and vote-counting too. Ronna McDaniel, chair of the Republican National Committee, said recently the RNC had trained more than 30,000 poll watchers ahead of this year's midterms. And likewise, election officials say they have seen an influx of poll workers and election monitors who think U.S. elections are stolen. Carly Koppes, the Republican clerk of Weld County, Colo., told Colorado Public Radio that all 35 poll watchers she approved for the state's June primary had ties to election denial groups. That can present a complicated situation. On one hand, having conspiracy-minded volunteers involved in the process can be a valuable chance to educate them on the way elections actually work. But Spencer Overton, a voting expert at George Washington University, says it can also be a powder keg if those people are set in their beliefs that there is widespread fraud and they need to uncover it. \"It's not about service and it's not about volunteering; it's about political activism and vindicating an election from a couple years ago,\" Overton said. \"That can result in real conflict.\" Researchers say the days following the election may pose a greater risk of violence than Election Day itself, particularly in locations where vote counting drags on. \"What happens when people don't have their preferred candidate win?\" said  Oren Segal, vice president of the Anti-Defamation League's Center on Extremism. \"They have seen that denial is a way forward, that you're able to create a community of conspiracy around that. I think violence is not that far behind.\" They have seen that denial is a way forward, that you're able to create a community of conspiracy around that. I think violence is not that far behind. Oren Segal, Anti-Defamation League Already, some influential voices on the right have said they're readying for contentious litigation around races that don't end up favoring Republican candidates. Tape recently surfaced of former Trump lawyer John Eastman, whose involvement in trying to overturn the 2020 election has been a central theme of the Jan. 6 committee's investigation into the attack on the Capitol, encouraging a crowd in New Mexico to scrutinize their election officials and take detailed notes that can be used in future lawsuits. \"You are allowed to make a written record of anything you see not going on correctly,\" Eastman said, according to audio obtained by the watchdog group Documented. \"That's called creating evidence.\" Hiller, of the Bridging Divides Initiative, said she expects the field of locations where threats of violence are most pernicious to narrow fairly quickly. Her team is specifically keeping an eye on races in the swing states of Arizona, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan and Georgia, where false claims of past election fraud have been embraced not just by many voters, but by some political leaders as well. \"They're [states] where there are senior leaders, specifically in the Republican Party, that are already calling into question the results of the election or have a history of advocating for violence or condoning violence around it,\" she said. Nonetheless, Hiller is optimistic that institutions that have preserved the democratic process in the past will have the resources they need in the face of these threats. \"One of the stories of 2020 for me is that many of the fail-safes worked. The court systems were effective. A lot of the recounts that happened were incredibly effective. And folks were able to surge resources to those locations,\" she said. \"So we're in for another election that's going to test those resources and that resolve.\" Many are also watching closely to see what this cycle may portend for the next big one: the 2024 presidential election. Whether or not former President Donald Trump runs again, experts say the efforts around undermining democracy during the midterms could drastically affect what many perceive to be the even-higher-stakes race for the White House, calling it a \"dry run\" for 2024. \"What are people going to be allowed to get away with in terms of how they confront people at voting booths or polling stations, etc.?\" Segal asked. \"In that sense, perhaps that's what people mean by a 'dry run.' \" Additionally, the midterms will test whether local organizing of far-right groups around challenging voter rolls and vote counting, and increased presence as election workers, will bear fruit. If it does, those efforts would be expected to continue or ramp up into the presidential election cycle. But as these strategies face a test during the coming weeks, so too do increased efforts around protecting the democratic process, said Hiller. \"Groups have been preparing day in and day out,\" she said. \"Even if some small incidents occur, if there's someone in a polling place trying to purposely create issues, then I think that the vast majority of polling locations, of counting locations, are going to be really well prepared for that. There's been a lot of additional thought on how to make sure folks are supported with de-escalation skills.\" Segal said it's critical that local and national institutions and leaders demonstrate in the coming weeks how they will navigate a supercharged political event. \"This should be a dry run for people who want to protect democracy,\" he said. \"Our law enforcement, our governmental institutions, our leaders, this is a dry run for them to make sure that they're doing whatever they need to do to protect our democracy moving forward.\"",

            "article_content": "An attack on the Speaker of the House's husband. Conspiracy-influenced poll watchers wearing tactical gear and staking out ballot drop boxes. Many experts are worried about the potential for violence.  AILSA CHANG, HOST: Today the head of the U.S. Capitol Police said his agency needs more resources to adequately protect members of Congress in the current political climate. This comes just days after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's husband was physically attacked in their San Francisco home. And these events have renewed concerns over the possibility of political violence around the midterm elections. Both NPR's Odette Yousef and Miles Parks have been looking into that possibility and join us now. Hi to both of you. MILES PARKS, BYLINE: Hi there. ODETTE YOUSEF, BYLINE: Hi, Ailsa. CHANG: So, Odette, I want to start with you. I mean, just how concerned is law enforcement right now about the threat of violence during this election? YOUSEF: Well, Ailsa, just some context first - you know, we've been building to this concern for years. One really shocking statistic is that in 2021, the Capitol Police reported 9,600 direct or indirect threats against members of Congress. And that's more than 10 times what it reported in 2016. But on Friday several federal agencies circulated an internal bulletin specifically focused on the risks around these midterms. And the bulletin said that extremists pose a heightened threat during this election cycle, most likely from what it calls lone offenders motivated by this now-widespread belief on the right that U.S. elections are corrupt and also motivated by certain hot-button social issues like abortion and LGBTQ rights. And targets of this violence could range from candidates to elected officials to voters and could take place at places like drop box campaign events and more. CHANG: And, Odette, when you talk about threats, is law enforcement pointing to, like, general vitriol online, or are there specific, targeted plans for violence that they're focusing on? YOUSEF: Well, so far, we're not hearing about specific or coordinated plans, but we are seeing a couple of things that are concerning - first, again, this widespread belief in election fraud combined with the potential calls to violence, which have become, frankly, much more common these last two years. The second concern is about voter intimidation. You know, Ailsa, Arizona has become sort of the poster child of this recently because some people were posting up with weapons and tactical gear at drop boxes, ostensibly to monitor voters. PARKS: And I'll also add - you know, Odette mentioned this idea of this lone offender theme when it comes to violence, but ballot box monitoring and election monitoring is not happening randomly. You know, Republicans nationally over the past two years have really been pushing for this sort of citizen oversight over elections. We saw this a little bit after the 2020 election. But they've really built an infrastructure aimed at pushing this sort of oversight. We're hearing this from candidates at the secretary of state level and also in places - far-right places like Steve Bannon's podcast, pushing people to kind of do this sort of monitoring. CHANG: OK. So, Odette, what should we be looking for as we move closer to election day? YOUSEF: Well, I spoke to Shannon Hiller about this. She's with the Bridging Divides Initiative at Princeton. And interestingly, she says she's actually feeling pretty good about how things will go on election day itself. SHANNON HILLER: Even if we look back to 2020, we saw very little violence around election day itself. There was lots of preparation and has been even more preparation by government and non-government groups to ensure that that's the case this year again. YOUSEF: So, Ailsa, the bigger concern really is the period after voting day. Hiller said she's going to be keeping a close eye on places like Arizona, Georgia, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin that are really charged politically, especially if election results are delayed due to recounts or litigation. CHANG: OK, so potentially bracing for something. But, Miles, what are we hearing from voting officials on all of this? PARKS: Well, we're hearing a lot about poll monitors, people who want to be poll watchers who believe conspiracies that the elections are stolen. And that kind of puts local election officials in a little bit of a bind. You know, on one hand, this could be a really good opportunity to educate some of these people and potentially bring them out of some of these conspiratorial rabbit holes about elections. But also, it can be kind of a powder keg if people who are actually involved in the mechanisms of elections believe there is fraud and want to do things to try to, you know, find that fraud. I talked about that with Spencer Overton, who's a voting expert at George Washington University. SPENCER OVERTON: It's not about service. It's not about volunteering. But it's about political activism and vindicating an election from a couple of years ago. That can result in real conflict. PARKS: All of this can also have this effect of voter intimidation that Odette mentioned earlier. You know, even in the many places where these sorts of things aren't happening, voters are seeing headlines about them and potentially could say, oh, no, you know, maybe I won't go cast my ballot just because I don't want to bother with the trouble. CHANG: Right. Well, Odette, we've been talking all along about concern around this midterm election. That said, midterms are, at least historically, less charged than presidential elections. So I'm wondering, like, are extremism experts already looking ahead to 2024? YOUSEF: Yes. I mean, many of them have been calling these midterms a dry run for 2024, Ailsa, in terms of testing what people will be able to get away with when it comes to confronting people at voting booths or at polling stations. But, you know, they also say it could be a dry run for people who want to protect democracy, too - so, you know, law enforcement, government institutions, everyone committed to protecting our democratic norms. CHANG: That is NPR's Odette Yousef and Miles Parks. Thanks to both of you. PARKS: Thank you. YOUSEF: Thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.  All rights reserved.

STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: President Biden goes to Florida today to campaign for Democrats in the midterms. This past weekend, though, he was at home in Delaware, and his wife, Jill Biden, was the one with the packed campaign schedule. Here's NPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith. TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: It's late afternoon on Long Island, N.Y., and first lady Jill Biden is at her fifth political event of the weekend. She starts her stump speech with something a lot of people can relate to. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JILL BIDEN: I'm a teacher, as well as a mom and a nana. So I stay organized, and I run my life by to-do list. KEITH: It's a thread that runs through Biden's remarks. Here she was on Saturday in New Hampshire. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BIDEN: This is an enormous race, but it comes down to things as small as saying to that mom or student or grocery store clerk, put the word vote in big, bold letters at the top of your to-do list. KEITH: The first lady is one of the administration's most requested speakers this cycle, with a pitch that is light on policy and heavy on humanity. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BIDEN: Today, I'd like to share a story from my life. KEITH: Biden describes the difficulties faced by a friend who got pregnant when they were teenagers, before abortion was legal. Then Biden talks about how shocked she was by the Supreme Court's recent decision overturning Roe v. Wade. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BIDEN: It was devastating to me. How could we go back to that? KEITH: While President Biden's midterm campaigning has been constrained by poor approval ratings, Jill Biden doesn't have that baggage. XOCHITL HINOJOSA: She knows how to connect with people. She understands the - you know, the issues that they care about. KEITH: Xochitl Hinojosa is a Democratic consultant and says the first lady isn't perceived as overtly political. HINOJOSA: And so I do think it is, like, helpful to have someone who, in a time when people have political fatigue, to kind of go in there and make a different case. KEITH: Former Jill Biden press secretary Michael LaRosa says it isn't only this first lady. Just read the headlines. MICHAEL LAROSA: You know, in 1990, you know, Washington Post - \"Barbara, On The Stump;\" The Chicago Tribune '06 - \"Please, Send Laura;\" NBC in 2014, you know, \"Better Half: First Lady Campaigns Where President Has Not.\" KEITH: And history is repeating itself as this first lady also campaigns where the president has not.

High School's David Lu returns a shot during a tennis tournament in May. When it's not attacking Democrats, the partisan Sangamon Sun has written repeatedly about Lu's national ranking \u2014 recently at 7,379th for boys under 18 \u2014 with no additional information. The paper twice illustrated the articles with a photo of a boy who appeared to be no older than 10, and white. Since late summer, many Illinois residents have been receiving newspapers that they haven't paid for nor, in many cases, even heard of. Each paper bears a clear-cut tagline: Real data, real news. And each publication that shows up in driveways and mailboxes carries a partisan punch that's blatant, but not formally disclosed. \"They present a strongly one-sided view of things,\" said Bernard Schoenburg, who covered Illinois as a journalist for decades. Schoenburg retired as a columnist for The State Journal-Register in Springfield in December 2020, 44 years after walking into his first job out of college at the Bloomington Pantagraph. In the intervening decades, traditional newsrooms throughout the state have withered, from the Pantagraph right up to the once-mighty Chicago Tribune. Some have shut down. That erosion of local news has created an opening for these newer publications, which lie dormant and then spring up at election time. They look a lot like hometown newspapers \u2014 nothing flashy, just long, printed broadsheet pages with color photos and graphics \u2014 but without any real interest in local news. \"You get these glaring headlines of ... what's so terrible about our tax system right now or what's bad about a Democratic governor,\" Schoenburg said. The coverage all points in a single political direction: hard right. Nearly a decade ago, Schoenburg first took note of a conservative news service set up by an arm of the Illinois Policy Institute, which crusades against greater taxation and regulation. A former senior fellow there, Dan Proft, has taken the idea a step further in the years since, creating publications and sites that have spread across the state. They present themselves as down-home newspapers in multiple communities with names that hark back to times before people relied on social media to find out about local developments. \"In this age, with so many kinds of media that hit people,\" Schoenburg said, \"people don't know, necessarily, what's real, if they're not sophisticated in this way.\" This fall, readers encountering the Sangamon Sun or Chicago City Wire or the Dupage Policy Journal or their sister publications will find coverage uniformly beating up on the policies and persona of Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, a Democrat who happens to be up for reelection. The West Cook News splashed an incendiary quote across the top of its front page recently: \"It's going to be literally the end of days.\" A two-page spread inside presented a vivid display of photographs of 36 men who were charged with violent crimes \u2014 but had not been convicted. They would all be released to Cook County's neighborhoods, the accompanying headline said, under legislation signed into law by Pritzker last year that eliminates cash bail. (Actually, judges will retain discretion to determine whether people facing serious charges pose a threat, according to reporting by WBEZ and other news outlets.) All but four of the 36 men in the photos were people of color. \"This is Republican propaganda and, in some instances, just outright lies,\" said Pritzker campaign spokeswoman Natalie Edelstein. \"The information being presented is intentionally being set up to mislead people. It looks like it's independent, local news. But in reality, when you read the content, it's playing on people's emotions and fear.\" Hard copy local papers that have recently appeared in the mailboxes of Illinois residents this election season have been assailing Democratic candidates, including Gov. J.B. Pritzker, and echoing conservative talking points.\n                \n                    \n                    NPR News\n                    \n                \nhide caption Among the people quoted in that front-page story in West Cook News: Dan Proft, who is not only one of the key people behind the papers but is also a conservative talk show host. Proft runs a political action committee called People Who Play By the Rules PAC that has spent millions aiding Pritzker's Republican opponent, state Sen. Darren Bailey. \"These newspapers that are circulating the state are full of fact and truth \u2014 and Gov. Pritzker has the gall to call it a lie,\" Bailey said on Proft's radio show in early September. Proft's PAC also helps to underwrite the papers, which he conceded on the air recently. Yet nowhere in the publications themselves is there any disclosure of the papers' pro-Republican agenda, its source of funding, or even its point of view \u2014 except, of course, in the relentless punching of hot-button issues for the right, including trans rights, COVID restrictions and taxes. Proft did not respond to NPR's efforts to seek comment, nor did cardboard shipping magnate Dick Uihlein, a major party activist who falsely argues that the 2020 presidential race was fixed and who has financed the PAC with more than $40 million this year, according to the Center for Illinois Politics. He did speak to the Chicago-based NewsNation television broadcast, telling anchor Leland Vittert that his readers do not trust mainstream news organizations. \"We provide angles to stories and information that you don't get from left leaning or left \u2014 or not so leaning, just hard left \u2014 news outlets,\" Proft said on NewsNation. \"They're all sharing a brain and we're providing a different perspective on some of the issues that are salient in people's lives.\" In Proft's recounting, the Illinois papers put out by the Local Government Informational Services \u2014 their publisher \u2014 sound like a throwback to an earlier age, when papers were openly partisan and ideological on their news pages as well as their opinion section. And there's a school of thought that that's a more intellectually honest way than reporters saying they shelve their own points of view. Conservative talk show host Dan Proft speaks to Tea Party supporters at a Tax Day rally in the Daley Center Plaza on April 18, 2011, in Chicago. Proft runs a political action committee and a network of news sites in Illinois to aid Republican candidates and causes.\n                \n                    \n                    Scott Olson/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Conservative talk show host Dan Proft speaks to Tea Party supporters at a Tax Day rally in the Daley Center Plaza on April 18, 2011, in Chicago. Proft runs a political action committee and a network of news sites in Illinois to aid Republican candidates and causes. What and how those issues are presented in these papers, however, constitutes a sharp departure from the way journalists at more mainstream news outlets, even point-of-view journalists, have covered the news for decades. For one thing, at least in the hard copy editions reviewed by NPR, the papers make no such clear and overt disclosures about their agenda in print, other than the overwhelming thrust of their articles. There's a second element to the papers that garners less attention. By contemporary newspaper lights, they are weird. \"There is other information in the publication that makes it look local, like what employees in government agencies are making a lot of money, what homes sold for a lot of money, and it's just things you can pick up off the internet,\" Schoenburg said. It's unclear who's scooping up those facts. Take The Sangamon Sun, based in the county where Springfield, the state capital, can be found. It published a story about an athlete based on his national ranking. David Lu was, the paper reported in mid-September, the 7,251st highest ranked player in the country under the age of 18. The article was eight sentences long and had no byline. It said nothing about Lu as a player or person. Instead, it offered a rote explanation of how such rankings were made and offered a single quotation pulled from a tennis instructor's 3-year-old essay in New York Tennis Magazine about the fierceness of competition. The Sangamon Sun did versions of the same story for weeks, each citing slightly lower or higher rankings for Lu, all with the same tennis pro quote. At least twice, the article was presented below a photograph of a young white boy, no older than 9 or 10, holding a tennis racket. A photograph of Lu during a tennis match taken by the Springfield State Journal-Register, however, shows him to be an Asian American high schooler. Other papers picked other high school athletes to highlight, equally without any personal touches. We've seen this before. The man behind that reporting model of mashing together details into something resembling a news story is a former reporter and political operative named Brian Timpone, who later became Dan Proft's business partner and ultimately helped to expand the Illinois paper model to other states. Back in 2012, Timpone created a service called Journatic, used briefly by mainstream newspapers, that relied upon a core of reporters and an army of freelancers to try to report on real estate sales, school lunches, city council meetings, high school sports and other events. Timpone also promised state-of-the art artificial intelligence. The service's credibility was dinged when This American Life revealed not just its use of bots but content mill workers far from the regions the newspapers served. They were often based in Asia, writing under fake bylines. \"Really what they're doing is assembling and copy editing a bunch of facts, right?\" Timpone told This American Life's Sarah Koenig in 2014. \"So they write the lead. If there's a paragraph about a person, the paragraph is technically written by someone in the Philippines, but not [really] written.\" Timpone sold Journatic to two newspaper chains several years ago and didn't respond to efforts to reach him for comment for this story. Despite the conclusions of media researchers that the papers are propping up candidates and causes, Timpone denied that his current firm, Metric Media, takes money to run content in the papers. \"Agenda-driven writers asserted this slur without a shred of evidence because our existence makes them feel insecure,\" he told the tech website Gizmodo. For what it's worth, I also haven't been able to reach a single person identified as writing directly for the Illinois papers. Not the writer whose byline is the same as a former social media manager and writer who works for an outsourcing company in Manila. Not the one who shares the same name as a byline on stories for UrbanReform.org \u2014 a conservative Texas-based site that has been part of the same larger network. Nor The Kane County Reporter's Laurie A. Luebbert. Fifteen years ago, a reporter wrote at The Virginian-Pilot under the same byline. Luebbert has no account on LinkedIn, Twitter or Facebook \u2014 unusual for a reporter in this day and age. Laurie \u2014 if you're out there \u2014 feel free to be in touch. And here's where it gets byzantine. Luebbert's byline doesn't just surface in other Illinois sister papers under Dan Proft. Her work also appears in Old North News in North Carolina, the New Mexico Sun, The Louisiana Record.  The Lansing (Mich.) Sun, and Keystone Today in Pennsylvania, published by Metric Media or affiliated companies. The list goes on and on. Pri Bengani, a senior researcher at the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University, counted more than 1,200 conservative local news outlets connected around the country in Timpone's network. She considers them AstroTurf sites \"laundering advocacy,\" driven by the interests of their funders, not an interest in news or in making money from the conventional news business. And she says the Illinois papers served as a model for what's mushroomed nationally. She first issued a study on the proliferation of the sites in 2019. In a new report, released Monday by the Tow Center in the Columbia Journalism Review, Bengani concluded that the sites are providing services even beyond the publications. \"This network acts as a convergence of special interests for free market advocates, multiple political action committees, the fossil fuel industry, a politically motivated Catholic group, and a group propagating the notions of election fraud,\" Bengani writes. She documented instances in which the sites and the larger network provided advertising, SMS messages, robocalls and websites as well as consulting and production costs. Timpone is not the only key figure in the system. Bengani also found links to a huge Texas PAC and a major Republican donor who is an oil-and gas-billionaire. In Texas, articles blamed wind power for the failure of the electrical grid there last year. (That has been discredited by multiple mainstream news outlets.) Stories in Arizona pushed Republican Senate nominee Blake Masters. In Ohio, it was his counterpart, J.D. Vance. And in Kansas, The Catholic Tribune surfaced almost exclusively to serve up anti-abortion rhetoric in advance of the August vote on the proposed state constitutional amendment that would have banned abortion there. Bengani writes that the political action committees and media operators of the sites often share information. Some contributors to pro-Trump causes who share their emails or mobile numbers find themselves automatically sent the outlets' content. She hastens to add that those who say that this kind of covert news advocacy happens on both sides have a point. \"If we are to be completely blunt about it, we are seeing folks on the left adopt this tactic as well,\" Bengani says. One group, Courier Newsroom, was created by a former Obama administration official. Another, American Independent, is championed by David Brock, the liberal activist and founder of the left-of-center watchdog Media Matters. Yet Bengani notes the difference in scale. She counts 64 such pro-Democratic newspapers and news sites. That's equal to about 5% of the right-wing publications she has been monitoring. \"You end up with this surround-sound effect,\" Bengani says. \"If people are hearing the same thing in multiple places, are they then more likely to believe it?\" Bengani says she can't measure how influential this echo chamber will prove to be. But she says the partisan papers are blanketing people who want to read local news and have fewer choices than ever.",

Former President Barack Obama cast voting for Democrats in this year's midterm elections as necessary to save democracy while campaigning for Sen. Raphael Warnock and gubernatorial nominee Stacey Abrams in Georgia Friday. \"Democracy is not self-executing,\" he said. \"It depends on us working, nurturing, caring for it not just on Election Day, but every day in between. It depends on us as citizens saying, 'This matters!' This election matters, Georgia.\" Obama delivered a winding address that served as a closing message for Democrats in several key battleground states, acknowledging the impact of inflation, rising crime and other issues salient with voters while painting the election as a referendum on the future of America. \"There may be a lot of issues at stake in this election,\" he said. \"But the basic question, fundamental question that you should be asking yourself right now is, who will fight for you? Who cares about you, who sees you, who believes in you? That's the choice in this election.\" He warned that a Republican majority in the House and Senate could gut abortion rights and potentially target other rights like same-sex marriage in future years. \"If that's not worth 15 minutes of your time, I don't know what is,\" Obama said. Supporters of Sen. Raphael Warnock and gubernatorial nominee Stacey Abrams cheer during a get out the vote rally in College Park, Ga. Warnock faces a tight reelection fight against Republican Herschel Walker.\n                \n                    \n                    Riley Bunch/ Georgia Public Broadcasting\n                    \n                \nhide caption Supporters of Sen. Raphael Warnock and gubernatorial nominee Stacey Abrams cheer during a get out the vote rally in College Park, Ga. Warnock faces a tight reelection fight against Republican Herschel Walker. Typically the party in power suffers losses in midterm years, and Obama told the crowded arena next to Atlanta's airport that the tough national environment should not discourage them from voting early in this year's election. \"I get why people are anxious, I get why you might be worried,\" he said. \"I understand why it might be tempting sometimes just to watch football or Dancing with the Stars. I'm here to tell you that tuning out is not an option.\" The former president's visit comes during the final weekend of in-person early voting in Georgia ahead of the heaviest typical turnout. More than 1.38 million Georgians have already cast their ballots in the 2022 election, shattering in-person early voting records for a midterm and approaching levels of enthusiasm typically reserved for presidential years. So far, early voting data from the Georgia Secretary of State's office shows an electorate that is older and Blacker than similar points in previous elections and nearly 5% of the early voters are either newly registered or sat out the 2018, 2020 and 2021 elections. Warnock is locked in one of the closely contested Senate races in the country against Trump-backed Republican Herschel Walker after Warnock and fellow Democratic Sen. Jon Ossoff narrowly won January 2021 runoffs to flip control of the U.S. Senate. Now, the road to a Senate majority may run once again through the Peach State, as polls show a tight race that could lead to a Dec. 6 runoff if neither candidate earns a majority in November, as Libertarian candidate Chase Oliver is also polling in the low single digits. \"We're turning out because we know that democracy is the political enactment of a spiritual idea,\" Warnock, the pastor of historic Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, said Friday. \"The vote is a sacred thing, your ballot is a bloodstained ballot. By all means, use it and make sure everybody you know uses it.\" Warnock's campaign has leaned into his brief time in the Senate so far, touting work to lower health care costs for seniors and bipartisan initiatives with colleagues like Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Sen. Tommy Tuberville of Alabama. At the campaign rally, though, Warnock pivoted his message from achievements to attacks on Walker's character and campaign dogged by revelations of falsehoods about his personal story and professional record. \"This is a man who lies about the most basic facts of his life,\" Warnock said. \"And we all saw it with our own eyes \u2014 he wears his lies, quite literally, as a badge of honor. If we can't trust him to tell the truth about his life, how can we trust him to protect our lives and our families and our children and our jobs and our future?\" The final days of the Senate race have been roiled by allegations from a second woman that Walker, a staunch abortion opponent, pressured her to get an abortion and paid for it. Abrams faces a much tougher road in a rematch against Gov. Brian Kemp after narrowly losing by about 55,000 votes in 2018. Kemp has run a campaign on Georgia's thriving economy and a first term that includes teacher pay raises, record budget surpluses and one of the earliest reopenings after widespread closures because of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020. The former state House minority leader has centered her second campaign around her signature issue of Medicaid expansion and the argument that Republican leadership in the state has left behind voters from both parties. \"Every election is a choice, and for so long, they've tried to make us believe that it's a choice between parties or personalities,\" Abrams said. \"This time we know it's different. This time it's an election about the choice between someone who attacks our freedoms and someone who will protect our freedoms.\" Kemp has led in nearly every poll for much of the campaign, and will be joined by former Vice President Mike Pence, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey in the final days of the campaign. Georgia gubernatorial nominee Stacey Abrams, former President Barack Obama and Sen.

Raphael Warnock cheer at a get out the vote rally in College Park, Ga., on Friday. Obama's services as a campaign surrogate have been in high demand in recent elections, both in Georgia and nationally, as President Joe Biden's favorability has lagged amidst rough economic headwinds. Ahead of the 2018 governor's race, he rallied for Abrams and assailed Republicans for \"trying to scare you with all kinds of divisive issues\" and less than 24 hours before Election Day in 2020 visited Georgia because it represented \"the place where we put this country back on track.\" Now in the closing days of 2022 he is visiting Georgia, Michigan, Wisconsin, Nevada and Pennsylvania as Democrats hope to retain their Senate majority and win governorships in a national environment that has typically favored Republicans but has seen weaker GOP candidates in key races. \"Democrats aren't perfect, I'm the first one to admit it,\" he said. \"Politicians just like all of us can make mistakes. But right now, with a few notable exceptions most of the GOP \u2014 and a whole bunch of these candidates \u2014 are not even pretending that the rules apply to them anymore.\" Before leaving the stage, Obama reiterated the importance of showing up to vote for all candidates, including those running for offices like secretary of state \u2014 offices that play a role running elections. \"It's not enough to elect Democrats at the top of the ticket,\" Obama said. \"We need to elect good people up and down the ballot. Across the country, some of the folks who tried to undermine our democracy are running for offices that will oversee the next election. And if they win, there's no telling what might happen.\"",

When Jack Hunt walked out of the Forsyth County, Ga., elections office after casting his ballot, he had one primary concern on his mind \u2014 the economy. \"It's ridiculous. The grocery stores, you go and some items are twice what they were before Biden's administration took office,\" the retired 71-year-old pilot said. \"We need to get the inflation under control.\" Many Americans, like Hunt, are voting with their wallets in mind in the midterm elections. Polls consistently show the economy \u2014 and, specifically, inflation \u2014 is a top issue. That's why in this final stretch of the campaign, both parties have been trying to control the narrative to drive voter turnout, stoking fears about what the other party would do to the economy if it controls Congress.

For months, Republicans have hammered Democrats for being the party in power as inflation hit a four-decade high. More recently, Democrats have tried to spin those inflation allegations around and argue that Republicans will make inflation worse if they win big on Nov. 8. President Biden has sought to cast the midterms as a choice between two economic visions, rather than a referendum on the economy under his watch. He has said the GOP intends to extend tax cuts for the rich, cut Social Security and repeal the Inflation Reduction Act, a sweeping package that aims to boost clean energy production and lower some prescription drug costs. \"If they take control, they said their first aim is to get rid of the Inflation Reduction Act, and inflation's going to go up, not down,\" Biden warned as he campaigned in Oregon earlier this month. This argument is the latest twist in White House messaging on inflation, a strategy that has evolved over many months as high prices persisted. But messaging is not the main issue for the administration, said Larry Summers, an economist who worked in both the Obama and Clinton administrations. Summers sounded early alarm bells on rising prices more than a year ago. \"We have a fairly serious inflation problem,\" he told NPR in an interview. Curing that problem is likely to cause a recession, in his judgement. \"That reality is appreciated by the American people. It's not really a communications problem that's causing them to be unhappy and concerned about it. It's a reality problem,\" Summers said. Loading... Joe Biden entered the Oval Office on Jan. 20, 2021, worried about rising evictions, hunger and poverty. He was inheriting an economy shaken by the COVID-19 pandemic, and unemployment was still over 6%. And so that first day in the White House, Biden announced a massive $1.9 trillion aid package. Summers warned in the Washington Post that it was too much money. Biden dismissed those concerns. The White House argued that the country was dealing with deep economic challenges, and the stimulus money was vital. \"The way I see it \u2014 the biggest risk is not going too big. It's if we go too small,\" Biden said. So weeks later, Democrats lined up behind their president and passed his bill, the American Rescue Plan. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen hit the airwaves to tout the legislation, downplaying the risks of  inflation. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on fears of inflation emerging from COVID relief bill: \"To get a sustained, high inflation like we had in the 1970's, I absolutely don't expect that.\" https://t.co/ZhTm4oR45m pic.twitter.com/VBfJN9uoZ3 By May 2021, inflation was creeping higher. But the White House insisted it was not a long-term problem. \"I expect all of this to be transitory, and I think the economy's going to get back on track,\" Yellen said at a Wall Street Journal event. \"I don't anticipate inflation is going to be a problem.\" This term \u2014 transitory \u2014 became the administration's go-to answer to questions about rising prices. And the president echoed his aides. \"Our experts believe and the data shows that most of the price increases we've seen are \u2014 were expected and expected to be temporary,\" Biden said.

In Northampton County, Pa. \u2014 a key swing county Biden narrowly won in his race for the White House \u2014 people didn't necessarily know who they blamed for inflation during the summer of 2021. But like Americans across the country, they were frustrated and wanted to see elected officials trying to fix it. \"Everything is very expensive right now. The food went up. Groceries went up. The gas. Insurance went up,\" Nazirah Lewis told NPR at the time. The single mother of three said the paychecks from her job as a nurse weren't going up even as prices did. It was a period where Biden was insisting that price increases were the result of an economy roaring back to life after the pandemic. The White House kept telling Americans that other indicators showed the economy was strong, thanks in part to Biden's COVID response and the Democrats' pandemic aid package. Some voters praised the $1,400 checks and expanded child tax credit that they had received from the rescue bill. But others were beginning to blame that relief for creating new economic problems. Everything is very expensive right now. The food went up. Groceries went up. The gas. Insurance went up. Nazirah Lewis July 2021 At his Turkish restaurant in Lehigh Valley, Erdinc \"Eddie\" Uzun said Biden was \"giving away money to people \u2014 it's too many, too many.\" \"My opinion is, cut off all the unemployment soon as you can to push the people back to work,\" Uzun told NPR. Bob Bast, a retired pastor in Pennsylvania who votes Republican, agreed in part with the White House explanation for inflation. \"I think it's part of maybe the pandemic, you know. Industry is trying to catch up, and things like that,\" Bast told NPR at the time. But Bast said he also felt like Biden's policies were partly at fault. As inflation persisted, people's partisan interpretations of the economy solidified. Loading... As inflation surpassed a 30-year high, the president began speaking more directly to people's pain. \"Everything from a gallon of gas to a loaf of bread costs more. And it's worrisome, even though wages are going up,\" Biden said in November at the Port of Baltimore. \"COVID-19 has stretched global supply chains like never before. And suddenly, when you go to order a pair of sneakers or a bicycle or Christmas presents for the family, you're met with higher prices and long delays, or they say they just don't have any at all.\" Biden and his team had stopped using that obscure phrase \"transitory\" and were focusing more on why inflation was happening and what the president would do to help. In retrospect, the phrase was too ambiguous, one of Biden's top economic advisers told NPR in a recent interview. \"It turned out that 'temporary,' or 'transitory,' I think was insufficiently specific, time-wise,\" said Jared Bernstein with the White House Council of Economic Advisers. \"No one was able to pinpoint the timing, in no small part because there were events that occurred that no one foresaw,\" Bernstein said. The White House was spending a lot of time talking about supply chains and semiconductors. The administration was also trying to explain that prices were rising around the globe, and that America was doing better than most. As Biden wrapped up his first year in office, his team focused on record job gains, unprecedented wage improvements for low-income workers and GDP growth not seen in decades. To be sure, the independent Federal Reserve holds most of the power for addressing inflation, and has been hiking up interest rates to try to tame it. But polls showed Americans were deeply cynical over the president's handling of the economy. Still, the administration was optimistic the problems would ease before the midterms. Treasury Secretary Yellen told NPR's Morning Edition that she expected to see inflation rates adjust down to the normal 2% level \"sometime during the second half\" of 2022. \"I think it's the peak of the crisis,\" Biden told reporters in December of 2021. President Biden speaks about inflation at the Port of Los Angeles on June 10, 2022. He blamed \"Putin's price hike\" \u2014 Russia's war on Ukraine \u2014 for spiking gasoline prices.\n                \n                    \n                    Evan Vucci/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption President Biden speaks about inflation at the Port of Los Angeles on June 10, 2022. He blamed \"Putin's price hike\" \u2014 Russia's war on Ukraine \u2014 for spiking gasoline prices. After Russia invaded Ukraine in February, gas prices soared, feeding the inflation problem. Biden began blaming \"Putin's price hike\" for spiking gas prices, along with supply chain snafus and greedy corporations. As the president repeatedly said his top priority was getting prices under control, his approval ratings were stuck underwater. Surveys showed Americans were deeply anxious about rising prices. The concern was bipartisan, but the culprit had now become more clearly partisan. Even as gas prices began to drop in some places, Republicans blamed Biden. In April, as retired concrete contractor Garfield Bowman filled up his Subaru at a Meijer gas station in South Lansing, Mich., he complained gas prices were \"extremely too high.\" Like many Republicans who NPR has interviewed over the past year, Bowman blamed Biden's decision to cancel the Keystone XL oil pipeline for high gas prices. It's a claim fact checkers have debunked. In Brighton, Mich., school bus driver Tom Moran said he didn't think it was Biden's fault, and praised him for releasing an unprecedented amount of oil from emergency reserves to try to temper gas prices. \"I think I think it's a supply chain thing happened because of COVID, because oil companies cut back on production because people weren't driving as much,\" Moran said. Loading... In August, new data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics suggested inflation was finally leveling off. Biden saw a moment for optimism. \"Today, we received news that our economy had zero percent inflation,\" Biden said the day the data was released. \"Zero percent.\" It was a true, but misleading statement for many Americans still feeling the higher costs. \"When my mother went through the Depression \u2014 that's what I feel like now,\" Liz Masterman, 72, told NPR in July as she walked into a food pantry in St. Petersburg, Fla. Gas prices had dropped, but food, rent and utility prices had not. And prices were still much higher than they had been before the pandemic. Some metro regions, like the area around Tampa, Fla., were still experiencing double-digit inflation, driven by housing costs. \"It's like you can't do anything fun with the kids or with family, 'cause the only money you have is really for bills,\" said Christina Willette, a certified nursing assistant in Florida making $15 per hour. The rent on her two-bedroom apartment was more than $600 per month more than it had been a couple of years ago. Both Masterman and Willette had supported Biden in his race against former President Donald Trump. But they still felt like he could be doing more to help with rising costs. Christina Willette, a mom of four, says she voted for Biden, but has felt more financial pressure since he entered office. \"That's who I picked, but it seems like that's when it started,\" she said.\n                \n                    \n                    Asma Khalid/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Christina Willette, a mom of four, says she voted for Biden, but has felt more financial pressure since he entered office. \"That's who I picked, but it seems like that's when it started,\" she said. As Democrats hit the campaign trail, they pointed to the package of legislative priorities that they had packaged together and branded as the Inflation Reduction Act. \"Democrats are lowering your everyday costs like prescription drugs, health care premiums, energy bills and gas prices,\" Biden told supporters at the Democratic National Committee headquarters this month. Many Democratic voters have said they're not voting on the economy in these midterms. They're motivated by issues such as access to abortion, and safeguarding democracy. \"Our economy is cyclical,\" said Richard Johnson, 59, outside a voting site in Alpharetta, Ga. \"The most important thing is the threat to democracy in this country right now.\" From left to right: Jose Berrizbeitia and Lillian Pinot are photographed after voting at a polling location at the Elections and Voter Registration Office in Cumming, Ga.; Richard Johnson is photographed outside of a polling place at the Alpharettta Branch Library in Alpharetta, Ga.; and Darrell and Velvet Sheets are photographed after voting in Cumming.\n                \n                    \n                    Dustin Chambers for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption There are some signs that some of Biden's explanatory messaging has broken through to more independent-minded voters. In Georgia, Lillian Pinot and Jose Berrizbeitia said were willing to cross party lines and vote for one Democrat on the ticket \u2014 and were not convinced Biden was to blame for inflation. \"We blame nobody, because it's everywhere. It's not only in the United States, it's worldwide ... Europe, South America, Asia,\" said Berrizbeitia. \"People just like to blame someone,\" Pinot added. In the closing weeks of the campaign, Biden has focused on an argument that Republicans will make inflation worse if they win, an 11th-hour scramble to reframe an economic storyline with the hopes of winning over a few more independent voters. But many Americans had already begun voting in the midterms, and their assessment of the economy is no longer malleable. \"Our 401(k)s are down by 25-35% ... so you can only draw some correlation to what's going on today to what's happened politically over the last 18, 20 months,\" Darrell Sheets told NPR after he voted for Republicans up and down the ballot in Georgia. But self-described fiscal conservative Dale Jordan said he voted for a third-party candidate for the Senate. He said he didn't think the Republican candidate, former football running back Herschel Walker, was qualified for the job. And while he said he's \"OK with some liberal stuff,\" he did not want to see incumbent Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock reelected either.

State legislative races can feel low stakes when compared to national political contests. But 2022 is shaping up a little differently. Democratically aligned super PACs and party-affiliated groups are spending tens of millions of dollars around the country to try to change the composition of state legislatures in key swing states, warning that fair elections could hang in the balance. The Republican Party aims to defend its majorities and to flip chambers in states where Democrats currently control both the legislature and governorship. In either scenario, these legislative bodies have become increasingly powerful in setting policy around health care, voting, education and reproductive rights. Much of Democrats' urgency stems from a case that the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear this fall. The outcome of Moore v. Harper, a fight over partisan gerrymandering in North Carolina, could give a fringe legal doctrine known as the 'independent state legislature theory' new legitimacy. Proponents of the theory argue that the U.S. Constitution gives state legislatures near total control over running federal elections, overriding both state constitutions and state courts. In an extreme scenario, the theory could be used as justification for a legislature \"to refuse to certify the results of a presidential election and instead select its own slate of electors,\" counsel for the Brennan Center for Justice, a non-profit think tank and advocacy group, wrote in June. That's a real concern for Democrats. After the 2020 election, many Republican lawmakers in states like Pennsylvania, Arizona and Wisconsin took steps to overturn the election or cast doubt on the results. Four of the six conservative Supreme Court justices have indicated support for the theory in recent opinions. Currently, the GOP holds majorities in the state legislatures of most major swing states. As a result, Democrats and Democratically-aligned outside spending groups are pouring money into competitive state legislature races where they see an opportunity to flip seats. \"A single Arizona state Senate seat could be more important than any other election in the country this year when it comes to the health and stability of our democracy,\" says Daniel Squadron, former state senator from New York and founder of the super PAC The States Project.

The States Project has committed to spending $60 million on these races. Forward Majority, another group promoting Democratic candidates in state legislatures, is investing $20 million this cycle, 70% of which will go to 25 state legislative races in three states: Pennsylvania, Arizona and Michigan. Much of that spending is just to get voters on the ground in key areas to care about these races. \"Voters often don't know who the candidates are, they don't know what's at stake, and they don't always vote the whole ballot,\" says Vicky Hausman, founder and co-CEO of Forward Majority. Those 25 elected officials could be a \"bulwark\" against attempts, like those following the 2020 elections, to send independent electors to Washington and override the popular vote, says Hausman. The official party arm, the DLCC, announced it had raised $45 million for these races as of October. Still, these numbers pale in comparison to how much can be spent on a single congressional contest. The GOP's aim this cycle is largely to hold its ground. \"We've said from the start that our number one priority this year is defending our razor-thin majorities in states like Arizona, Michigan, and New Hampshire,\" RSLC Communications Director Andrew Romeo wrote to NPR. \"That hasn't changed as we come down the stretch.\" The overturning of Roe v. Wade has boosted Democrats, making the possibility of a total \"red wave\" less certain. Conventional political wisdom dictates that they should win more seats, as the party not in the White House usually does during the midterms. However, in many states Republicans have another kind of edge. In order to redraw district lines to benefit their own party after the 2010 census, Republicans put in a majority to win state legislatures that year. Even after another round of redistricting since then, very few races are actually in play. The party already holds the majority in 55 of the 88 chambers with elections this year, according to the RSLC. \"It's this endless feedback loop where the state legislature plays a hand in drawing its own lines, runs for office in those lines, and then can stay in office,\" says Sam Wang, professor and director of the Gerrymandering Project at Princeton University.

State legislatures have grown in influence and power over the last two decades, leading to a patchwork of laws around the country on reproductive rights, voter registration, health care, education and guns. \"The decisions made in state capitals probably have a greater impact on people's routine activities than many of the decisions made in Washington, D.C.,\" says Peverill Squire, professor of political science at the University of Missouri. Some of that is unintentional, as gridlock in Congress slowed down the pace of federal legislation, he says. Some of it is explicit, as when in 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down parts of the Voting Rights Act and allowed states to make changes to election law without prior federal approval. When it comes to abortion rights, a change of power in some state chambers could either give the GOP the edge to override vetoes by Democratic governors to institute new restrictions \u2013 for example in North Carolina \u2013 or could put more Democrats in a position to preserve abortion rights, in states such as Pennsylvania and Michigan. \"States and state legislatures in particular are setting the tone and direction for our country ... while the rest of us are distracted by the shiny objects inside the Beltway,\" says Squadron.",

Crime and public safety are among the issues that have taken center stage in many midterm races nationwide, from Wisconsin to Pennsylvania to New York. Republicans are repeating a page from their 2020 playbook by ramping up ads accusing Democrats of being soft on crime. The GOP spent nearly $40 million on crime-related messaging in September alone, as NPR has reported \u2014 and ad spending tends to be a good indication of what candidates and their backers think will sway voters. The ads are hard to miss, warning of \"defund the police Democrats\" and liberal incumbents who have failed to bring violent crime under control. They point to rising crime rates and paint casting midterm votes as a life-or-death decision (Democrats are arguing a similar case, but about abortion rights). The messaging taps into a fear clearly shared by many voters, even if it's not their top or only concern. Some three-quarters of respondents of a POLITICO/Morning Consult poll released earlier this month said that they thought violent crime is increasing nationally, and 88% said it is either increasing or staying the same in their own communities. For many, those fears are grounded in jarring incidents and unmistakable trends, from successive mass shootings to brazen attacks during daylight hours. So are crime rates in the U.S. actually skyrocketing, as some claim? \"We don't really have a common definition of what crime means, when you ask that question,\" says Jeff Asher, a data analyst who specializes in crime statistics. After working with the Pentagon, CIA and New Orleans Police Department, he co-founded the consulting firm AH Datalytics. The FBI's annual crime report for 2021, released earlier this month, says violent crime decreased by 1% from the previous year. But the report is also incomplete, as only 63% of the country's police departments submitted data \u2014 and New York City and Los Angeles were not among them. The FBI tracks seven major types of crime, Asher explains on Morning Edition. Property crime \u2014 theft, auto theft and burglary \u2014 has been falling regularly for the last 20 years. Violent crime \u2014 aggravated assault, murder, rape and robbery \u2014 increased at least in 2020, but remains lower than it was in the 1990s. \"But even that, when we talk about crime, is not what people think of,\" Asher says. \"What they're really thinking of is murder and gun violence, and murder makes up 0.2% of all big-picture crimes every year. But it's the crime with the most societal harm. It's the thing that people tend to care about the most.\" There's been a dramatic uptick in murder over the last several years. FBI data shows that it rose nearly 30% from 2019 to 2020 \u2014 the largest single-year increase ever recorded in the U.S. The number of homicides increased 4.3% nationally in 2021, according to the FBI report, and Asher says it likely decreased by a similar amount so far this year. Nonetheless, it's higher than it was in 2019. In other words: The murder rate is significantly lower than it was in the 1990s \u2014 Asher says 30-40% lower \u2014 but much higher than it was just three or four years ago. Importantly, that's a national rate. Asher thinks the reason crime carries so much weight in these midterm elections is because the increase in murders in 2020 was truly a national phenomenon. \"It happened in big cities, it happened in small cities. It happened in counties that voted for Trump, it happened in counties that voted for Biden,\" he says. \"It was really everywhere, and so I think that most places in America are grappling with at least some increase in gun violence over the last two years, which brings it to the forefront of these elections as they're taking place now.\" The data informing these reports is \"both reliable and unreliable,\" according to Asher. And it got even more confusing this year, thanks to a change in the FBI's data collection methods. Most big cities tend to produce and make crime data available in some format in \"near-real time,\" so that people can see numbers from the last few weeks, months or quarter, he explains, adding that smaller cities, suburbs and sheriff's offices don't necessarily make it as accessible. And on a national level, the FBI collects data from local law enforcement agencies and reports it out a full ten months later. That makes it really difficult for researchers and policymakers to get any sort of nationwide estimates about these trends as they're happening, Asher says. And they can't solve a problem that they don't fully understand. \"We've really got this change in murder, which almost happened overnight and has been sustained for two years, and we're not able to measure progress against it or regression against it,\" he says, \"Because at this really inopportune moment, our data collection has suddenly gotten much worse.\" This year, the FBI changed the way it collects crime data \u2014 and many of the nation's roughly 18,000 law enforcement agencies were slow to get on board. The data collection system, called the National Incident Based Reporting System (NIBRS), has been around for years \u2014 but it requires departments to log crimes in greater detail, and wasn't their only option for doing so before. In 2015, the FBI announced that it would be switching from its previous system to only using NIBRS beginning in 2021, meaning that as of this year, departments had to submit data via NIBRS or not at all. As it turns out, many chose the latter. The 63% of law enforcement agencies that submitted data for 2021 marks the lowest level of participation the FBI has reported in decades, and only 52% of them submitted a full 12 months of data. This new methodology, and the numbers themselves, come at a precarious time, Asher says. It doesn't just make it harder for stakeholders to work on solutions; it also makes it harder to refute false claims about crime, especially this election season. So how should people be sorting through all this messaging? Asher says that as a data analyst, he wants to focus on the data \u2014 while a chart isn't necessarily the most effective means of communication, he says the numbers behind the claims are crucial. \"Absent that, we get a lot of politicians that are saying a lot of things that frequently are based on anecdote or sort of the vibes of the moment,\" he says. \"And we get, then, a lot of misinformation and poor decisions being made in the name of data-less arguments.\" This interview was conducted by Rachel Martin, produced by Lindsay Totty and edited by Simone Popperl.",

MILWAUKEE \u2014 Standing outside the Milwaukee Public Market, Matthew Grover has one thing on his mind: getting voters to turn out. \"It's extremely important,\" he tells two health care workers. \"If we get the right people in positions of power, we can do all of these things simultaneously.\" Grover is a regional field organizer for NextGen America, a youth voting group. And on a recent Saturday morning he was asking young people whether they are planning to vote during the midterms. That's because even though young voters turned out in increasing numbers in the last two election cycles, the most recent NPR/Marist national poll found that this year, young voters were among the least likely to vote this fall. Tom Bonier, CEO of TargetSmart, a Democratic-leaning data firm, says there are some preconceived notions about young voters \u2014 that they are not a factor in midterm elections. \"And so campaigns tended not to spend resources on talking to younger voters and engaging with them,\" he said. And Bonier says that in the end, voter turnout between the 2014 and 2018 election increased. He says there could be a big turnout this year, too. In Wisconsin alone, more than 300,000 people have already voted by mail or in person. Damian Funmaker performs a traditional Ho-Chunk dance with the Wisconsin Dells Singers and Dancers during an event hosted by Wisconsin Native Vote to encourage voting at the Gerald L. Ignace Indian Health Center in Milwaukee, on Friday.

So we went to Wisconsin \u2014 where there are hotly contested races for the U.S. Senate and governor \u2014 to see if recent events, such as the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade in the Dobbs decision, have enticed more voters to register. And they have. \"Specifically, since Dobbs, there's been an increase in voter registrations among women and younger voters,\" Bonier said. \"We're seeing the highest intensity surges among women under the age of 25. And it's definitely true in Wisconsin, but that's something that's been almost universally true around the country.\" And for new voters like 19-year-old Kai Rowlands, making sure those in office pay attention to the youth vote is important, too. Rowlands, a student at Marquette University, says those in office need to make sure \"the younger generations' views are being taken into consideration and need to be represented.\" Kai Rowlands, 19, poses for a portrait in his dorm room at Marquette University in Milwaukee, on Sunday.

Rowlands is an undergrad studying physics and Spanish. Young voters are known as reliable pillars of the Democratic base. And at a time when the Democratic Party is seeing low favorability, we asked Rowlands and two other left-leaning voters in Milwaukee about the issues they see as most important. Those issues ranged from abortion to the economy to climate change. Looming over the midterms is the Dobbs decision overturning Roe v. Wade \u2014 which meant states can enact their own abortion laws. In Wisconsin, an 1849 law banning abortion took effect after the Supreme Court decision. And it's weighing heavily on people's minds. Kara Walla, a 29-year-old software engineer, is starting to think about having children, but worries what choices she will be left with if something goes wrong. \"Now I'm having to think about being in that position \u2014 of having something go wrong in a pregnancy and then not being able to access health care until the point where my own health is threatened, as well,\" Walla said. \"And it's really scary.\" Kara Walla, 29, poses for a portrait in her home in downtown Milwaukee, on Sunday.\n                \n                    \n                    Kayla Wolf for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Kara Walla, 29, poses for a portrait in her home in downtown Milwaukee, on Sunday. It's also really scary for Rowlands, who thinks about what that means for his younger sister. The Supreme Court, \"they're all kind of opinionated in their own ways and support what they want, not what the country wants,\" he said. In a recent Marquette University Law School poll, inflation was one of the top concerns among respondents. And it's true for Gen Z voters, like 20-year-old Melanie Medina. Medina, a dental receptionist, worries about how expensive her bills have gotten \u2014 from groceries to rent. \"I moved out from home right when I was 18. It was semi cheap then,\" she said. Now, she lives with her boyfriend, a roommate, and their cats. And rent has only gotten more expensive.

The economy is also top of mind for Walla. \"My husband and I just bought a house last year,\" she said. \"And between the mortgage payments and then car payments, we're starting to think is it even doable to have kids in this economy?\" President Biden's approval rating among young voters has improved over the past few months, according to recent NPR polling. But that doesn't mean he should run again in 2024, Rowlands says. \"My grandparents are similar ages to him and there's no way I'd want one of my grandparents running the country. And that's no offense to them,\" he said.  \"I don't think that that level of uncertainty is necessarily something we should look for in a leader.\" Walla, the only millennial we spoke to, is eager to see more young people in office. \"And at this point, it's like by younger you could be a younger person in politics in your 60s,\" she said.

Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, stand on stage before a debate Oct. 6 in Des Moines. Like so many places in the country, the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade energized supporters of reproductive rights in Iowa. Democrats see Grassley's role on the Senate Judiciary Committee as a key player in that eventual ruling. Grassley blocked former President Obama's Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland ahead of the 2016 presidential election and then shuttled former President Trump's nominee of now-Justice Amy Coney Barrett through nomination hearings ahead of the 2020 presidential election. A handful of protesters turn out almost every Friday in the small northeastern Iowa town of McGregor holding signs that say things like \"Abortion is Healthcare\" and \"Women: Vote Like Your Life Depends on it... Because it Does.\" \"We're barreling towards 2024, which really seems like the last chance we have to stay a democracy,\" protester Erin Cubbon said. \"It's scary.\" Cubbon says it's hard to believe Iowa helped launch former Obama's rise to the White House and was among the first to legalize same-sex marriage. It's also the same state Sen. Grassley has been representing in Congress for nearly a half-century. He has been reelected easily partly because he presents himself as a moderate. But the 89-year-old has learned to embrace Trump like Republican voters have in the state. Grassley accepted his endorsement at a Trump rally in Des Moines last year. \"I was born at night but not last night so if I didn't accept the endorsement of a person that's got 91% of Republican voters in Iowa,\" Grassley joked to thousands of cheering Trump supporters on the Iowa State Fairgrounds. \"I wouldn't be that smart.\" Republican support is not hard for Grassley to find. That means, though, that he's often facing questions about the legitimacy of the 2020 presidential election on the campaign trail. Typically, these questions come from voters concerned about the legitimacy of the 2020 election.

It's a fact that what I said on [December] the 14th, when the electoral votes were counted.\" It's clear Grassley is an institution in Iowa but a new Des Moines Register Iowa poll suggests voters might be ready to move on even as this state becomes redder.

In comparison, Iowa's Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds enjoyed a 17-point advantage over her Democratic challenger, Deirdre DeJear. Franken is hoping to catapult that public opinion advantage in a reddening state into the U.S. Senate. He recognizes, though, it is an uphill climb. \"There's a portion of Iowa that will not vote for me because I'm a Democrat, that will not change. I will hold office and I will support them to the best of my ability,\" Franken said. \"That's completely different than the Republican perspective on this state, where it is support your own and to hell with the rest.\" Many had written Franken's campaign off after a police report surfaced saying he kissed a former staffer without consent. National Democrats are not engaged in Iowa either. Grassley has the cash advantage but Franken raised twice as much money as Grassley in the last fundraising quarter. Franken is also hammering Grassley on abortion, hoping that will drive Iowans to the polls.

A second woman is accusing Georgia Senate nominee Herschel Walker of pressuring her into having an abortion, calling the Republican a \"hypocrite\" for campaigning against abortion access while allegedly pushing her to get one in 1993. \"Herschel Walker is a hypocrite and he is not fit to be a U.S. senator,\" an anonymous woman who went by the name Jane Doe said in a Wednesday press conference. \"We don't need people in the U.S. Senate who profess one thing and do another.\" The woman is declining to share her identity out of safety concerns, according to her attorney Gloria Allred, and came forward after hearing Walker deny allegations from another woman who said he paid for her to have an abortion. NPR has not been able to independently corroborate either woman's claims. Jane Doe said she had an affair with Walker while he was married to his first wife Cindy Grossman from 1987 until the alleged abortion in 1993, and claimed Walker drove her to an abortion clinic and paid for the procedure after she backed out of an initial attempt. \"I went to a clinic in Dallas, but I simply couldn't go through with it,\" the woman said. \"I left the clinic in tears. When I told Herschel what had happened, he was upset and said that he was going to go back with me to the clinic the next day for me to have the abortion.\" The woman, who said she is a registered independent but voted for former President Donald Trump in 2016 and 2020, said she was motivated to speak out after seeing Walker deny allegations made in a series of stories by The Daily Beast that he pressured a then-girlfriend to have two abortions. \"Particularly, I saw him state that the woman's claims were not true because he never signed any cards using the letter 'H,'\" she said. \"I knew that was not true because he had often signed letters to me using H.\" During a press conference, Allred shared several items that Doe had from her relationship with Walker, including a photo of Walker in her hotel room while he was at a training camp in Minnesota, letters from Walker to the woman and her parents, and an alleged voicemail that Walker left while in France for the Winter Olympics in 1992. \"What I can do is, I'm trying to call you back while I'm here, but I have to call you, like, early in the morning cause it's late at night there when I'm up and the restaurant is open,\" Walker allegedly says in a voicemail recording. \"But I keep trying to call you. I want to say I love you.\" Walker has continued to deny any and all claims he paid for an abortion, including on the campaign trail Wednesday. Just before the second woman's allegations became public, Walker deflected questions from reporters by dismissing the story before specific claims had been made. \"You know, guys, I'm done with this foolishness,\" he said after an event in northeast Georgia. \"I've already told people this is a lie.\" South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, who was campaigning with Walker and is one of several Senate Republicans who have made the trek to Georgia in hopes of winning the majority this November, attacked Allred and tried to downplay the accusations. \"People here are not going to tolerate it, there's going to be a backlash in Georgia,\" Graham said. \"This is coming from L.A. It's coming from an activist Democratic celebrity lawyer who went to the 2016 convention for Hillary Clinton, and people in Georgia are not this dumb.\" Walker's blanket denial of ever paying for an abortion comes as the first-time candidate has sought to walk back his hardline stance on abortion in a state that has recently seen top races decided by tens of thousands of votes. The Trump-backed candidate previously expressed support for a federal abortion ban with no exceptions for rape, incest or the life of the mother, but falsely claimed in a recent debate that he always preferred Georgia's new law that effectively bans most abortions after cardiac activity is detected, around six weeks into pregnancy. Walker has lagged in fundraising and most polls to Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock, who has largely framed the abortion stories as part of a pattern of false statements and exaggerations surrounding Walker's campaign, like overstating his personal backstory and business accomplishments. \"We know Herschel Walker has a problem with the truth, a problem answering questions, and a problem taking responsibility for his actions,\" Warnock's deputy campaign manager Rachel Petri said in a statement. \"Today's new report is just the latest example of a troubling pattern we have seen play out again and again and again. Herschel Walker shouldn't be representing Georgians in the U.S. Senate.\" It is not yet clear how the allegations about Walker or his vehement denials will affect the Senate race, especially as more than one million Georgians have already cast their ballots. Polling conducted after the initial stories about Walker's first alleged abortion payment saw support for the Republican slightly decline, though oftentimes within the margin of error. A recent Monmouth survey of Georgia voters already found a majority of voters have an unfavorable opinion of Walker, including a notable number of Republicans. If no candidate wins more than 50% of the vote, the race would head to a Dec. 6 runoff that could once again decide control of the U.S. Senate.",

Pennsylvania Senate candidates John Fetterman, the Democratic Lt. Governor, and Republican Dr. Mehmet Oz, a former TV doctor, faced off Tuesday night in the only formal debate of the race. The two were in an a TV studio, without an audience, in Harrisburg, Pa., where they sparred over abortion rights, fracking, the economy and crime. Due to a stroke he suffered in May, Fetterman had video monitors in the studio with live transcription of what was being said. His doctor has said the former mayor of Braddock, Pa. is fit to serve, but the process of reading live captions had Fetterman speaking somewhat haltingly through the debate. His performance hasn't seemed to dampen financial support though \u2014 the Fetterman campaign says they raised $1 million in just three hours after the debate ended. \"It's clear that the people of Pennsylvania have John's back in this race. They stepped up tonight with a gigantic show of support for John and his debate performance,\" Brendan McPhillips, Fetterman's campaign manager, said in a statement. The Oz campaign also saw last night as a victorious debate, pointing out to supporters in an email that Fetterman failed to answer questions about his position on fracking and on releasing his medical records. Recent polling shows Fetterman and Oz are extremely close. The Senate race has also been the most expensive; outside groups have spent more than $130 million on the race, the most spent on any other race this cycle, according to Open Secrets, which tracks money in politics. Fetterman made a direct hit on Oz over the issue of reproductive rights, which has been a top reason driving Democrats to the polls this year, coming out forcefully that Roe v. Wade should be codified into law. \"Roe v. Wade for me should be the law... my campaign would fight for Roe v. Wade,\" Fetterman said. For his part, Oz tried to paint himself as moderate on the issue, in attempts to reach suburban voters in the state who are more moderate and independent \u2014 despite the fact that he has said he is \"100% pro-life.\" He also skirted around answering how he would vote on Sen. Lindsey Graham's bill to ban abortion nationally after 15 weeks of pregnancy, except in the cases of rape, incest and to protect the life of the woman. Oz has said he supports exceptions to a ban on abortion when it concerns rape, incest and the life of the mother, but in a new move last night, he said the decision on Roe should be up to \"local political leaders.\" \"As a physician, I've been in the room when there's been some difficult conversations happening,\" Oz said on stage. \"I don't want the federal government involved with that at all.\" By Wednesday morning, Fetterman's campaign was already running ads tying Oz's position on abortion to right-wing Republican candidate for governor, Doug Mastriano, who supports absolutely no exceptions in an abortion ban. The ad says Oz is out of touch and would let extreme politicians like Mastriano lead the way on abortion in the state. Oz repeatedly used the word \"extreme\" to describe Fetterman's positions throughout the debate, used it again in describing his opponent's statements about fracking and said his opponent was \"rigidly stuck\" on fighting fracking. On stage, Fetterman said he has always supported fracking \u2014 but four years ago, the lieutenant governor, then a candidate for the position, said he never would support it. When asked about his previous statements by one of the moderators, Fetterman paused, waiting for the closed captions to load on the screen, and stumbled through his response, simply saying, \"I do support fracking. I support fracking and I do support fracking.\"",

Voters are being asked to approve a law declaring that an embryo or fetus is a legal person with a right to medical care if born prematurely or survives an attempted abortion. LR-131, a referendum for the Born Alive Infant Protection Act, would require doctors provide resuscitative care to infants born at any stage of development, or face penalties. Eighteen states already have so-called born alive laws on the books \u2014 all of them put there by state legislatures. Montana's would be the first to be passed by legislative referendum, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. \"A lot of people speculate, including myself, that the reason it was put on the ballot, was to gin up the base and get them out to vote on this very divisive issue and one that people are very passionate about,\" says Sally Mauk, a political analyst who's reported on the Montana legislature for more than 30 years. Mauk says that the proposed law was put on the ballot before the U.S. Supreme Court ended the federal protection for abortions in the Dobbs case in June. \"I think what's happening now in the wake of the Dobbs decision and Roe being overturned,\" Mauk says \"is that LR-131 could have actually the opposite effect. And besides getting people out who are passionately opposed to legal abortion, people passionately in favor of legal abortion will see this issue on the ballot and turn out to vote against it \u2014 and therefore maybe vote also against Republican candidates.\" Proponents of the act say it's morally necessary to protect innocent life. Opponents say it gives the state too much power to decide what's medically reasonable, which could end up harming families suffering pregnancy complications. In January, 2021 Marcus Cahoon and Lea Bossler's daughter Maesyn was born at just 25 weeks. She had a severe medical condition called fetal inflammatory response syndrome doctors didn't think they could fix. \"Marcus and I were given the choice to take Maesyn outside for her final moments,\" Lea Bossler says. \"Being ex-wildland firefighters and Montanans, we had no hesitation in taking that opportunity.\" Bossler told her story at an event in Helena in September opposing the proposed law, LR-131. \"[Maesyn's] death under LR-131 would have been extremely traumatic for everyone, rather than beautiful and peaceful,\" Bossler says. \"Legally forced repeated chest compressions and epi shots would have done nothing but overdosed, bruised and broken her already dying body.\" The Born Alive Infant Protection Act would require medical providers give life-saving care to infants born at any stage of development: Born as a result of \"natural or induced labor, cesarean section, induced abortion, or another method,\" the legislation reads. If the referendum LR-131 passes, medical professionals who \"fail to take medically appropriate and reasonable actions\" could face up to $50,000 in fines and 20 years in prison. Montana law currently protects against infanticide. Individuals can face penalties if, the law states, \"The person purposely, knowingly, or negligently causes the death of a premature infant born alive, if the infant is viable.\" In 2002 a federal law granted infants born alive the same rights as persons, but did not mandate care or include penalties. Eighteen states have passed laws similar to what's on the ballot in Montana requiring physicians provide care or face criminal penalties. Republican state Rep. Matt Regier from Kalispell introduced Montana's born alive referendum, which passed along party lines during the 2021 legislative session. Regier says the intent is to protect innocent life. \"It's a simple bill of are we going to protect infants that are born alive for any reason, not just a botched abortion, but any infant that's born alive,\" he says. \"Do they deserve that same medical services that you and I are afforded, what's medically appropriate and reasonable?\" What Regier calls \"botched abortions\" are rare: According to analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation, 1% of abortions in the U.S. occur after 21 weeks around the time of viability. CDC data of infant deaths over a 12-year period show that of 143 live births following an induced abortion, most cases involved fetal anomalies or maternal complications. And nearly all \u2014 96% \u2014 survived less than a day. Dr. Tim Mitchell, an OB-GYN in Missoula who guides women through high risk pregnancies, says the premise of LR-131 is not based in reality of how health care is provided. He says who the bill will really impact is families suffering pregnancy complications. \"The clinical situations where we are dealing with an infant born alive is in the setting of a rapid, pre-viable preterm birth or in the setting of these lethal fetal anomalies where we know interventions are not going to have a change in the outcome,\" Mitchell says. Last month Mitchell spoke at an event at the Capitol in Helena organized by the opposition group Compassion for Montana Families. He says if the referendum passes, physicians will be forced to make decisions out of fear of prison time and fines rather than following the families wishes for how they want to spend final moments with their infant. \"LR-131 will force physicians to attempt to place a breathing tube in a baby whose lungs have not yet developed or is so small that the tube cannot fit,\" he says. Regier says the opposition is disingenuous in saying the referendum would require doctors to take a terminally ill infant from its family and try to resuscitate it. He points to language on the ballot that reads \"a healthcare provider shall take medically appropriate and reasonable actions to preserve the life and health of a born alive infant.\" \"To me that just defies common sense, I mean, of what is medically appropriate and reasonable, and if you're going to say trying to revive a terminally ill baby\u2014 that's not medically reasonable,\" he says. \"That seems pretty straightforward.\" Mitchell, the OB-GYN, says the way the bill is written leaves too much gray area. \"Who is going to be the ones deciding what reasonable care is?\" he says. \"Is it going to be the state attorney general who is going to potentially look into cases, because anybody can file a complaint against a physician or providers who are involved in care of some of these very tragic circumstances?\" Voters will decide if the state should get involved in decisions made in the delivery room, absentee ballots have already been mailed, the deadline to vote is Nov. 8.",

One of those rare districts is North Carolina's 13th, a newly created district that runs from the city of Raleigh through two suburbs and all the way out into two rural counties. Bo Hines, the Republican candidate, is a 27-year-old former college football player who describes himself as a \"MAGA warrior.\" Wiley Nickel, the Democratic candidate, is a state senator who has been running on his experience, aiming his pitch at registered Democrats and voters with no party preference listed. \"It just takes, you know, a smaller group of folks in the center, center-right to say, 'We're tired of it,' and we win this race,\" Nickel told NPR as he walked door to door in the Raleigh suburb of Cary, handing out campaign literature.

This ad from the National Republican Campaign Committee is one of several accusing the Democratic candidate Wiley Nickel of being soft on crime because he is a defense attorney. Meanwhile, the Democratic candidate and allied outside groups are painting Hines as an extremist, playing up his ties to Trump and an endorsement from Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene. There's also an ad hitting Hines on abortion, which the candidate has described as a genocide. This ad from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committtee paints the Republican candidate Bo Hines as extreme. That's a theme showing up in campaign ads in races all over the country. Outside of early voting sites in the district, a trend quickly emerged in interviews with voters. Even those not registered with a party are casting their ballots with a partisan lens. Jim Miller described himself as fiercely independent. But he said he couldn't imagine voting Republican this time. \"Hell no to Bo,\" said Miller, quoting from a Democratic campaign slogan seen on signs throughout the district. \"What qualifications does he have?\" he said. \"Really, I think he's got a lot of growing up to do.\" Judy White said she voted for Hines, though she has voted in the past for Democrats. She and her husband Jim said they are deeply concerned about the state of the country, including how divided people are. But, they said they see Democrats as the threat. \"Inflation, schools, the wokeness of what's going on, all of the people with the violence,\" Judy White said. \"Everything's just out of control.\" The candidates aren't shying away from this division. They're leaning into it, describing it in epic terms. \"This is more than just a political fight. This is spiritual warfare,\" said Hines in an interview that aired on CBS 17 in Raleigh earlier this month. \"It's good versus evil.\" This is part of a national trend of widening partisan divisions. A new poll from NBC News found 80% of Democrats and Republicans believe the other party's agenda \"poses a threat that if not stopped will destroy America as we know it.\" Nickel, the Democratic candidate, also gave a stark warning about the stakes of the race. \"Democracy is on the ballot, and the right to choose is on the ballot and is especially important in this race,\" he told NPR. \"I've served my state in the Senate. And on the other side, we've got an election denier who says he's 100% pro-Trump.\" Hines has said he will accept the results of this election, but he was noncommittal in a recent interview about whether Joe Biden won in 2020 fair and square \u2014 which Biden did. Even in a swing district like this one, there just aren't that many swing voters left. \"You would have thought that candidates might focus more on those swing voters to make persuasive arguments,\" said Mike Rusher, a former Republican Party operative in the state who now works with corporate clients. \"As we approach the finish line, in hindsight, I think people can see why maybe that's not needed in a year like this,\" Rusher said.",

            "article_content": "The open senate seat in Pennsylvania has led to one of the closest races in the country. Democrat John Fetterman and Republican Dr. Mehmet Oz face off Tuesday in their first \u2014 and only \u2014 debate.  AILSA CHANG, HOST: The contest for Pennsylvania's open seat in the U.S. Senate is among the closest and most closely watched in the country. It features two very high-profile candidates - Republican Mehmet Oz, better known as the celebrity TV doctor, and Democratic Lieutenant Governor John Fetterman, who suffered a stroke back in May and only recently resumed a full campaign schedule. Tomorrow, they will hold their only debate. NPR's Don Gonyea reports. DON GONYEA, BYLINE: John Fetterman's task, as the campaign enters its final weeks, is twofold. He must convince voters to support him to help Democrats hang onto their razor-thin majority in the Senate. On top of that, he needs to demonstrate that his recovery from a stroke five months ago is on track and that he's up to the job he's running for. You'll find him doing both on the campaign trail. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JOHN FETTERMAN: Johnstown. (CHEERING) FETTERMAN: This is unbelievable on a Friday night. GONYEA: He still wears his trademark black hoodie and baggy shorts. And do I need to remind you that he's 6-foot-8, shaved head, arms full of tattoos? Fetterman, who is currently Pennsylvania's lieutenant governor and a former small-town mayor, is much thinner than he was pre-stroke. And you can tell he's more careful, less gregarious. He talks about what he calls the elephant in the room. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) FETTERMAN: The only lingering issues, if you want to call that, is sometimes I miss words. Yeah, sometimes I might - it's a true. It's a true. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: All right. FETTERMAN: And sometimes I might mush words together that really doesn't exist, you know? GONYEA: But mostly, he does seem like any candidate giving a basic stump speech. This one lasted more than 20 minutes. Molly Leverknight, a hospitality worker who's here with her mom, was watching Fetterman closely as he spoke. MOLLY LEVERKNIGHT: Yeah, I mean, I don't need him swinging off the rafters. I think he was fine. I think he was honest. He says, I get words confused. I think he was honest and says, you know, I might miss something here and there, but I have no problem with that. GONYEA: Just days ago, Fetterman's doctor released a statement saying he's recovering well and has no work restrictions. He describes Fetterman as exhibiting, quote, \"symptoms of an auditory processing disorder.\" So as he recovers, Fetterman uses a computer screen that shows him subtitles during interviews to help with what can seem like difficulty hearing. He'll use that same technology during the debate. Both candidates are spending heavily on TV. Oz, who's been endorsed by Donald Trump and who ran as a conservative in the primaries, now portrays himself as a moderate as he attacks Fetterman on crime and inflation. (SOUNDBITE OF POLITICAL AD) MEHMET OZ: John Fetterman would raise everyone's taxes, making inflation that much worse. We need more balance and less extremism in Washington. I'm not a politician. I'm a heart surgeon. GONYEA: Fetterman, meanwhile, is hitting us on reproductive rights, saying Oz will vote against access to safe and legal abortion. In this new ad, Fetterman gets help from former President Obama. (SOUNDBITE OF POLITICAL AD, \"OBAMA FOR JOHN FETTERMAN\") BARACK OBAMA: When the fate of our democracy and a woman's right to choose are on the line, I know John will fight for Pennsylvanians. GONYEA: There is also a marked difference in how these candidates campaign. Fetterman, even as he recovers from a stroke, publicizes rallies in advance. With Oz, it's a much more guarded approach. Oz events are more like this one, with friendly media. Here he is in York, Pa., with Sean Hannity on Fox News, where Oz makes his pitch to moderate Democrats and suburban voters. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) OZ: We believe in the grit of Americans. We believe in America. That is the fundamental difference between me and the far-left radical elements of the Democratic Party. And I think, Sean, it's not... GONYEA: Fetterman, meanwhile, continues to hammer away at Oz as a fraud, as a doctor who sold cure-all supplements on TV, as a candidate who only established residency in Pennsylvania to run for office. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) FETTERMAN: Send Dr. Oz back to New Jersey... (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) FETTERMAN: ...And send me to D.C. Thank you. GONYEA: Fetterman and Oz will debate Tuesday evening in Harrisburg. Fetterman has consistently led in polls, but his once-sizable advantage has narrowed considerably. Don Gonyea, NPR News.

            "article_content": "The economy is a top concern this midterm election, but voters have other things on their minds, too. We hear from early voters in a competitive North Carolina House district.  AYESHA RASCOE, HOST: The midterm election wraps up in just about two weeks, and the turnout has been high in some of the states that have early voting. NPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith is in North Carolina, talking to early voters in the suburbs around Raleigh, and she joins me now. Good morning. TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Good morning, Ayesha. RASCOE: So, Tam, what brought you to North Carolina in the neck of the woods of my hometown, Durham? So Raleigh is very close by. KEITH: Indeed. So I was looking for a competitive House race where I could get a sense of the mood of the country. And there just aren't that many of them. North Carolina 13, though, is competitive. It was drawn to be competitive. As you say, it's in the suburbs of Raleigh and some more rural counties. And there's early voting here. So I spent several hours standing outside of polling locations talking to people after they finished voting. And one thing that really stood out is the polarization, even among voters who are registered with no party preference. Take Jim Miller. JIM MILLER: I'm a solidly independent voter, and I have to say in the past, mostly I have voted Republican. But I don't know if I could ever send another Republican to Washington again. KEITH: So he cited election denial after 2020 as a driving factor. Then there was Darlene Royal, who named several Republicans no longer in office who she respects. DARLENE ROYAL: I'm a registered independent, and I've been able to vote both sides in the past. But after all the stuff that's gone on, I just can't see myself even swinging towards Republicans because of the - all the misinformation. KEITH: Then I interviewed Tony Vanschaick. He's a Republican. TONY VANSCHAICK: We used to select who the best candidate was based on the issues. Now I think it's time just to wipe out the wrong side. And then once those are wiped out, then start going after the bad ones on our side. KEITH: We talk a lot about polarization, but this is not an academic concept. It is very real. And it was very much on display in my conversations with voters and the distrust that they have for the other party, you know, the grave concerns that they have about the state of the country and their total and complete disagreement about who's to blame for it. RASCOE: Wow. Wiping out the other side. KEITH: Yeah. RASCOE: OK. So for the voters who told you they are voting for Democrats, what seems to be their key motivation? KEITH: You know, several mentioned education and the economy. Some talked about the state of democracy. But I think every single one mentioned abortion and reproductive rights, like Marcy Rodgers. MARCY RODGERS: The economy is a big one but also abortion, very big one. I have daughters and granddaughters. So that has been a big one for me to just have our say as far as women's rights. KEITH: Two years ago, four years ago, before the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision, she said abortion wasn't an issue that drove her to vote. Now it is. Darlene Royal, who we heard from before, put it this way. ROYAL: Like somebody else says, the economy eventually will correct itself. Women's rights are not going to correct itself. KEITH: And Democratic candidates all over the country are counting on this being a motivating issue for their voters because otherwise, all of the historical precedent works against them. Here in North Carolina, abortion access is less restrictive than other Southern states. And there's a Democratic governor who could veto a ban. But Democrats are extremely motivated to make sure that Republicans don't get a supermajority in the state legislature. RASCOE: And what about those voting for Republicans? KEITH: Well, Republican voters I spoke to think Joe Biden is destroying America. I heard that again and again. They think he's hurt the economy, that he's taken the country in a bad direction. And they consistently bring up the economy and inflation. Christopher Gherardi told me that on abortion, it should be between a woman and her doctor but that that issue is not influencing his vote. He said it's all about the economy. CHRISTOPHER GHERARDI: Food is outrageous now. We normally spend $50 a week for food for the family. Now I'm up to $80 a week for food for the family. The economy is a big thing now. We're going downhill now. I hope you realize two years ago, the economy was roaring. It was great. People took home more money. Everything was better. RASCOE: So, Tam, you know, in the about 30 seconds we have left, former President Trump continues to loom over national politics. He was subpoenaed Friday by the House January 6 committee. Is he a factor for the people you've been talking to? KEITH: Well, the Democratic voters I spoke to blamed him for the divisions in the country, but they also see the issues as having grown beyond him. I asked every Republican I spoke to whether they think Trump should run again. And there were a lot of long pauses. Some said, no, he was too divisive or proved that he couldn't win. Others did want him to run again. But I also got a lot of awkward pauses when I asked whether Biden should run again when I talked to Democrats. RASCOE: That's NPR's White House correspondent Tamara Keith. Thank you so much. KEITH: You're welcome. Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "Democrats are embracing the police during the midterms. But can they distance themselves from crime in Democrat-run cities, such as Philadelphia, Pa.?  SCOTT SIMON, HOST: Polls say that crime is one of the three biggest issues on the minds of voters this year along with inflation and abortion. Republicans often blame Democrats for rising violent crime. Democrats often brag about funding the police. NPR's Martin Kaste reports from the battleground state of Pennsylvania. MARTIN KASTE, BYLINE: The Republican playbook here is similar to what we've been seeing around the country. Take this TV ad by Senate candidate Mehmet Oz. (SOUNDBITE OF POLITICAL AD) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Weak prosecutors. Crime skyrocketing. Failed liberal policies making us less safe. KASTE: And in Pennsylvania, the political symbol of crime is the biggest city, Philadelphia. It's suffered a terrible wave of violence recently as the number of shooting victims has jumped almost 60% in two years. Yolanda Jennings lives in West Philly. She's an activist with a group called Crime Survivors for Safety and Justice. YOLANDA JENNINGS: I get emotional. I really get emotional because I do love this city so much. And it's very hard to watch the things going on in the city. KASTE: At the same time, Jennings says she's unhappy with the role that the city's being cast in during this election cycle. JENNINGS: We're being used as political tools. KASTE: Standing at the center of all this is Larry Krasner. He's Philly's progressive district attorney, a nationally known figure in the movement for less incarceration. The Republican-controlled state House has targeted him with something called the Select Committee on Restoring Law and Order. It's been holding hearings throughout the campaign season. Here's State Representative John Lawrence opening one of the sessions with a litany of tragic headlines. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JOHN LAWRENCE: Two-year-old shot in another night of gun violence in Philly. Girl, 8, caught in the crossfire as nearly 50 shots fired in North Philadelphia. So this is not normal. It is not OK. KASTE: The committee could end up recommending Krasner's impeachment, and that would be just fine with Charles Strange. CHARLES STRANGE: I think they definitely have to get rid of Krasner. KASTE: Wearing a Trump hat and a Phillies jacket, Strange lives in Bucks County, where the select committee just held a hearing on whether Philly crime is now spilling into the suburbs. He believes it is. STRANGE: Oh, it's here. And what are you going to do when they lock them up they're out the next day? LAWRENCE: Ask Krasner about all this, and he sees politics and racism. LARRY KRASNER: I think the Republican logic goes like this - fear, fear, fear, fear, Willie Horton. That's their logic. KASTE: Krasner's in his downtown office, sitting underneath a poster of the police mug shots of Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King Jr. Philadelphians reelected him by a wide margin last year. And he says that's why the Republican legislature is now talking about impeaching him. KRASNER: It is a fundamentally anti-democratic, fundamentally fascistic effort to erase the votes of the people whose elected official they elect. KASTE: He says it's true that he doesn't prosecute lower-level crimes such as prostitution or marijuana possession, but he most certainly does go after gun crime. As to the midterms, Krasner says statewide Democrats might do better this year if they took a chance and embraced what he's been trying to do in Philadelphia. KRASNER: There's this huge segment of votes who are left, and they are progressive, and they're Black, and they're brown, and they're broke. And they will come out for reform prosecutors. And the mainstream Democratic Party is running away from victory, and they're running away from success. KASTE: But outside the city, Democratic candidates are not about to take that advice. In Wilkes-Barre, two hours north of Philly, Congressman Matt Cartwright has just announced a million dollars in federal grants to help hire more local cops. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MATT CARTWRIGHT: So please join me in saluting these valiant police officers and police departments and commend them on the work that they've done to make our communities safer. (APPLAUSE) KASTE: Cartwright's in a tight race against Republican challenger Jim Bognet, and he won't be dragged into giving an opinion about what's happening in Philadelphia. JIM BOGNET: We are immensely proud of the Philadelphia Phillies. We love the Philadelphia Eagles. But we don't really want the problems that they have in Philadelphia with crime and policing and the things that Mr. Krasner is dealing with. So I don't have a lot to say about what the answers are there. KASTE: It's a strategy that's best summed up by Cartwright's latest TV ad in which the Democratic congressman is endorsed by a man in a red MAGA hat who says he's for the police.

            "article_content": "NPR's Ailsa Chang talks with Republican strategist Alice Stewart and Democratic strategist Joel Payne about how political campaigns communicate their messages to voters with political ads.  AILSA CHANG, HOST: Election season is upon us. Early voting is underway in several places around the country. And if you spend any time scrolling through social media, listening to the radio or watching TV, you're probably hearing and seeing a whole lot of this. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Crime is a bigger problem than ever. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: A crisis of human trafficking, crime and lethal opioids. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: A ban on abortions. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: Inflation has gotten out of control. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #5: And I approve this message. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #6: And I approve this message. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #7: And I approve this message. CHANG: A barrage of political ads as campaigns in the major parties drop a lot of money to turn out voters. Well, we wanted to get an idea of what campaigns are saying and how they're saying it. And here to walk us through that is Republican political strategist Alice Stewart. She's worked on many Republican presidential campaigns, including the ones for Ted Cruz and Mike Huckabee. And we have Democratic political strategist Joel Payne. He worked on Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign and has also worked for Democratic members of Congress. Welcome to both of you. ALICE STEWART: Hi, Ailsa. Great to be with you. JOEL PAYNE: Thanks so much for having me. CHANG: So I want to start by talking about just the extraordinary amount of money being poured into ads this season. I've seen numbers of almost - what? - $10 billion being spent this cycle, which is more than even the 2020 presidential election, right? Alice, can you just talk about what is driving all this tremendous spending this year? STEWART: As we hear every cycle and every campaign and every election, this is a very consequential election for several reasons. The 50-50 split in the Senate and over in the House, it looks as though Republicans have the opportunity to pick up seats to take control of the House. And Republicans look at this as an opportunity to put a check and balance on what they see as the very liberal, very progressive policies of the Biden administration that they see are not working. CHANG: OK. And, Joel, can you tell us more about, like, what is at stake in your mind for Democrats this cycle? PAYNE: You know, I think Alice makes some really good points there about just the stakes that are on every election, really, right? Every appeal is this is the most important election of your lifetime. I also think there's a premium on reaching the voters that really make the difference. And, you know, not to get into the business of advertising, but TV stations and websites that are the places where you can reach these voters, they understand that it gets more and more expensive. Also, it depends on where you're talking about. Reaching a voter in the middle of Ohio costs different, is different than reaching someone, say, in Florida or in California. CHANG: Right. PAYNE: It's more expensive based on metropolitan areas and also the number of voters, the density of voters and how crowded the media space is. CHANG: All right. Well, in terms of reaching voters on salient issues, let's do a lightning round for the both of you. Like, what are, in your mind, the top three election issues for Republicans and the top three for Democrats? Alice, you go first. STEWART: Clearly, you look at the polls, and you talk to the voters. When it comes to Republicans, the economy and inflation are the top issues for voters, followed closely by crime and public safety for Republican voters. CHANG: Joel? PAYNE: Well, you know, I think if you look actually at the president's actions this week, there's two of them that he's referring to, which is the economy - you look at the news about the Strategic Petroleum Reserve - and then also the issue of abortion. The president's going to be announcing that the next session of Congress, that's going to be the first issue he puts forward. I'll put a third in there as democracy issues - January 6, issues of preserving democracy. Those are on the minds of Democratic voters. CHANG: OK. Well, we asked each of you to pick a political ad that you think is good. And we're going to play a little bit for everyone. Here is the one that Joel picked. (SOUNDBITE OF POLITICAL AD) TIM RYAN: If we have 10 conversations in one day... ANDREA ZETTS: ...And we agree on seven... RYAN: ...We crack a bottle of wine. ZETTS: Yes, we do. (SOUNDBITE OF CORK POPPING) RYAN: The same goes for the country. We have to stop the stupid fights... ZETTS: ...To find some common ground... RYAN: ...And be Americans first. CHANG: OK. That is from the Senate race in Ohio. It's an ad for Democrat Tim Ryan, who is running against Republican J.D. Vance, a candidate who was backed by former President Trump. And, Joel, what do you think works about this ad? PAYNE: Well, so a couple of things. One of the reasons is because he is appealing not just to his base, but he's appealing to voters in the middle, to independents. And I think this ad is a great example of that. This is not a base-turnout ad. It is an advertisement to say, even when we disagree, we can do it without being disagreeable. He's using his family to demonstrate the very common disagreement you might have around the home. It's a really effective spot because I think it also, for a lot of voters who may not know who Tim Ryan is, I think it portrays him in a positive, reasonable light. CHANG: OK. And, Alice, you picked an ad from Dr. Mehmet Oz, the Republican running against Pennsylvania Lieutenant Governor John Fetterman for a Senate seat in Pennsylvania. Let's hear a little bit from that ad. (SOUNDBITE OF POLITICAL AD) MEHMET OZ: Guys like John Fetterman take everything to the extreme. Why are we letting murderers out? Why is the solution always tax and spend? Extremism on both sides makes things worse. We need balance, less extremism in Washington. CHANG: OK. So, Alice, explain what you think the thinking is behind this ad. STEWART: The thinking by the Oz campaign is that crime is through the roof in parts of Pennsylvania, specifically in the Philly suburbs. And people are concerned about who is going to represent them and really be tough on crime. He also touches on reducing taxes and the economic issues that are really impacting people across the state of Pennsylvania. So he was not only just talking policy points. And I think it's an extremely impactful closing ad as we get to the end of the election cycle. And based on what the polling numbers show, crime and the economy are top issues for people in Pennsylvania. CHANG: But can I just flag, like, what's an interesting difference in strategy, at least the strategy that these two ads represent? Tim Ryan seems to be calling for unity. He seems to be going for the middle, if you will, as Joel, you know, was explaining earlier. And Mehmet Oz is kind of trying to stoke a little fear here - right? - by talking about crime. We hear a lot that voters don't like negative ads, but what do you think actually stays with people? Alice, you go first. STEWART: Every campaign and every candidate will say they don't want to do negative ads. But when they feel as though it will help sway undecided voters, they will certainly do it. And I truly don't view the Oz ad as negative. I view it as showing the strong contrast, and it's factually accurate in terms of pointing out Fetterman's record. What I do want to note on the Tim Ryan ad, this is an excellent example of what you do in the ad wars differs from what you do on the debate stage because he has been very forceful. And it's a good stark contrast of what you can do in an ad and follow up your messaging, maybe in a different type of fierceness on the debate stage. And Ryan certainly did do that. CHANG: What do you think, Joel? PAYNE: I think that each ad exists in a different political atmosphere and political universe. So in Pennsylvania, the electorate looks different than in Ohio. There are more available voters to Mehmet Oz in Pennsylvania, I think, than there are to Tim Ryan in Ohio. Tim Ryan has to persuade more voters. He has to bring more voters in. And each state is a laboratory. It's different for each candidate. And it's different in each race. CHANG: Yeah. PAYNE: So the appeals are going to be different, and the circumstances are going to be different. I think reflective of maybe what Alice I chose are also the political positions of the sides that we have both spent our careers working for. Republicans are expected to take control in two weeks. And Democrats are trying to hold on to control of both houses of Congress and obviously the White House for 2024. So you're in very different political ecosystems, political universes and political realities, frankly. CHANG: That is Democratic strategist Joel Payne. He worked on Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign and has advised Democratic members of Congress. We also had Republican strategist Alice Stewart. She's a veteran of Republican presidential campaigns. Thank you both so much for speaking with us. STEWART: Thank you, Ailsa. Thank you, Joel. PAYNE: Thank you so much. Good to speak with you.

            "article_content": "President Joe Biden speaks about abortion access during a Democratic National Committee event at the Howard Theatre in Washington, D.C., on Oct. 18.\n                \n                    \n                    Evan Vucci/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption President Joe Biden speaks about abortion access during a Democratic National Committee event at the Howard Theatre in Washington, D.C., on Oct. 18. President Joe Biden vowed that if voters elect more Democratic senators and keep the House, he will send a bill to Congress to codify abortion protections into law. Biden doubled down on abortion rights as a voting issue for Democrats this November during a speech at a Democratic National Committee event in Washington, D.C. \"We're only 22 days away from the most consequential moment in our history in my view, in recent history at least \u2014 an election where the choice and the stakes are crystal clear, especially when it comes to the right to choose,\" Biden said Tuesday. \"Right now, we're short a handful of votes. If you care about the right to choose then you got to vote,\" he said. \"That's why these midterm elections are so critical to elect more Democratic senators in the United States Senate and more Democrats to keep control the House of Representatives.\" Since most legislation requires a 60-vote threshold to advance in the Senate due to the filibuster rule, Democrats would need to abolish the filibuster, which could allow the law to pass with a simple majority vote. Yet Democrats currently lack the 50 votes in the Senate needed to remove the filibuster, with Democratic Sens. Joe Manchin and Krysten Sinema both expressing opposition to ending the procedure. This November, Democrats would need to elect at least two more candidates to the Senate who are willing to vote in support of ending the filibuster. Biden said if such a bill to codify abortion protections is passed, he will sign it in January, the 50th anniversary of the Roe v. Wade decision. Currently, Democrats hold an even 50 votes there, and control is likely to be decided in just a few races, with the House also facing slim margins. The House previously passed a bill that would protect the right to abortion, but the vote in both chambers was largely symbolic because the Senate did not have enough support to pass it. Even Pennsylvania Democrat Bob Casey, who has previously voted for abortion restrictions, voted against the symbolic measure. Then there is the threat of GOP efforts should Republicans win more seats. Sen. Lindsey Graham introduced a bill that would have created federal restrictions on abortion, a measure Biden said he would veto if passed. Abortion rights emerged as a main campaign talking point for Democrats following the Supreme Court's reversal of the landmark Roe v. Wade decision, which prompted many states to enact abortion-restricting laws. Although inflation has continued to be the top issue for both voters and Republican candidates, abortion rights have emerged as a top issue for voters as well. It has been particularly energizing for younger voters, whose voter registration numbers increased following the Supreme Court's decision. In his Tuesday speech, Biden specifically called out to younger voters who may have voted for the first time during the 2020 election. \"In 2020 you voted and delivered the change you wanted to see in the world. In 2022, you need to exercise the power to vote again for the future of our nation and the future of your generation,\" Biden said.",

            "article_content": "Does Russia's use of Iranian drones signal a shift in strategy? Gubernatorial candidates debate in Georgia rematch. President Biden will make what's billed as a \"major\" speech on abortion rights.  A MART\u00cdNEZ, HOST: Over the past 10 days, Russia has effectively opened up a new front in its war against Ukraine. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: The Russians are attacking with long-range airstrikes, including drones, directed at civilian targets in cities across Ukraine. MART\u00cdNEZ: NPR national security correspondent Greg Myre is following these developments. Greg, Russia is again pounding Ukraine with these air attacks. I mean, how bad did it get? GREG MYRE, BYLINE: Well, it's continued this morning. Russia is hitting civilian targets in several Ukrainian cities, far from the front lines, on Tuesday morning. This includes the capital, Kyiv, according to Ukrainian officials and media reports. So far, the most significant damage seems to be in the east-central city of Dnipro, where electricity stations have been hit, causing power outages. And just recently, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has taken to Twitter. He says Russia has destroyed fully 30% of Ukrainian power stations since they began this round of attacks, and it's causing widespread blackouts. And he went on to say that, quote, \"there's no space left for negotiations\" with Russian President Vladimir Putin. MART\u00cdNEZ: You know, Russia has fired missiles throughout this war, but these latest attacks have featured drones. Why use drones, and why now? MYRE: Well, Russia received these drones from Iran a couple months ago, according to U.S. information. And these came amid indication that Russia was running low on its own stocks of long-range weapons. And we saw on Monday, Russia unleashed what appeared to be the largest such drone attack yet, firing more than 40 of these so-called kamikaze drones, and most were aimed at Kyiv. Now, the Russians are targeting heating and electricity plants that the Ukrainians will obviously need this winter. Residential buildings are also being hit. And we can't stress enough that most, if not all, these targets are civilian targets, not military targets. MART\u00cdNEZ: Ukraine's air defenses, how is it coping with these attacks? MYRE: Well, these Iranian drones have some drawbacks. They're noisy. They're often described as being like lawn mowers or mopeds from people on the ground who can hear them. They fly at relatively low altitudes and slow speeds, often just a little over a hundred miles an hour. So Ukraine's air defenses, which have exceeded expectations throughout the war, are having success in shooting many of them down. Ukraine said it shut down 37 of 43 drones on Monday. But when dozens of drones are coming in, a few get through and cause damage and deaths. Four people were reported killed on Monday. Now, Ukraine has been pleading for more air defense systems throughout the war. The U.S. and other NATO countries are now promising to send some, including some very advanced systems. But they're not there yet. MART\u00cdNEZ: What are the chances, though, that this Russian approach might change conditions on the battlefield? MYRE: Well, right now the general consensus is that it won't. In fact, many analysts are saying that Russia is doing this precisely because they've been doing so poorly on the battlefield. They're looking - some way to gain an advantage. But, you know, that said, the attacks do terrorize civilians in the cities in central and western Ukraine that haven't really been hit since the early days of the war, and Russia's goal appears to be making life as difficult as possible for Ukrainian civilian. But it's just not clear that this will improve Russian forces on the front lines. MART\u00cdNEZ: That's NPR's Greg Myre. Greg, thanks. MYRE: My pleasure. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MART\u00cdNEZ: All right, early voting is now underway in Georgia. And last night, Republican Governor Brian Kemp and his Democratic challenger, Stacey Abrams, met on a debate stage in Atlanta. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) STACEY ABRAMS: Mr. Kemp, what you are attempting to do is continue the lie that you've told so many times I think you believe it's the truth. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BRIAN KEMP: I will remind you that Stacey Abrams campaigned to be Joe Biden's running mate. MARTIN: The race is a rematch of 2018, when Kemp narrowly beat Abrams. But much has changed since then. MART\u00cdNEZ: Sam Gringlas of WABE in Atlanta has been following this race, traveling around the state and also talking to voters and the candidates. Sam, Abrams versus Kemp feels like one of those old heavyweight boxing rivalries. So last night, did they slug it out, or was the debate maybe more of a skills clinic? SAM GRINGLAS, BYLINE: Well, Kemp and Abrams have basically been each other's archnemesis for over four years now, and so, yeah, they did not hesitate to spar back and forth. But they also both really know the ins and outs of state government, so overall, this debate was pretty substantive and at times kind of wonky. There was this one moment that got a little bit heated. The candidates were talking about a law Kemp signed allowing people to carry handguns without a permit. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KEMP: Well, there is a... DONNA LOWRY: Thirty seconds. KEMP: ...Thorough background check on every individual that buys a firearm in the United States. ABRAMS: That is not true. KEMP: Well... ABRAMS: Mr. Kemp, if you purchase... KEMP: None... ABRAMS: ...A weapon in Georgia through gun sale or a private sale... KEMP: Well. Ms. Abrams, I haven't... ABRAMS: ...Through gun sale or private sale, you are not subject... KEMP: I have not... LOWRY: All right, we are going to have to move on. GRINGLAS: And we did have a bit of news. Kemp was asked if he'd support any laws further restricting abortion beyond the roughly 6-week ban he'd already signed, and he said no and quickly pivoted to inflation. MART\u00cdNEZ: Now, Kemp beat Abrams by about 55,000 votes four years ago, but, Sam, a lot has changed since then. GRINGLAS: Well, more than 1.6 million new voters have registered in Georgia since 2018. Kemp is now an incumbent with a long conservative legislative record. And Abrams has become a global celebrity, buoyed in part by her role activating new voters and helping turn Georgia blue in 2020. But unlike the last midterms, when a blue wave kind of swept across the country, Trump is not in the White House, and the current occupant, Joe Biden, has approval ratings that are underwater. The country is different, too. States like Georgia have drastically curbed access to abortion. And persistent inflation is driving up costs of groceries and gas. MART\u00cdNEZ: All right. Now, both candidates are fighting to not only turn out their voters but also speak to people who might be on the fence, and that battle might be most pronounced in Atlanta suburbs where you, Sam, have spent a lot of time lately. What have you found out? GRINGLAS: Well, a big question that's hanging over these midterms in Georgia and, frankly, around the country is how many suburban voters who helped propel Biden into office will stick with Democrats now. I met a woman named Krista Wagner, who voted for Trump in 2016 and then Biden in 2020. But her flip to the Democrats, it was not permanent. She's voting Republican for governor. And she says her concerns about inflation outweigh her opposition to that restrictive abortion law that Kemp signed. KRISTA WAGNER: I'm upset with that, but I'm also really worried financially. I know that there are other states that will keep it. If there's ever a woman who needed my help, I'd take her there. GRINGLAS: Now, a million new residents have arrived in Georgia over the last decade, many of them people of color, settling in metro Atlanta. So the suburbs will probably keep trending toward Democrats in the future, but right now Georgia's elections are decided by such slim margins that even small shifts can shape the outcome of these races. MART\u00cdNEZ: Sam Gringlas is WABE's politics reporter. Sam, thanks. GRINGLAS: Thanks so much. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MART\u00cdNEZ: President Biden is scheduled to make what the White House is billing as a major speech later today about abortion rights. MARTIN: Yeah. So the big question is whether abortion is going to motivate Democrats to the polls, even though voting is already underway in some states. MART\u00cdNEZ: We're going to pose that question and more to our senior political editor and correspondent Domenico Montanaro. All right, so what are the details of today's speech, and why is the White House saying that President Biden is focusing on this now? DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Well, the White House says this is part of the ongoing effort by the president and the administration to try and call attention to, quote, \"an assault on access\" to women's health care by Republican officials. And he'll likely talk about federal and state attempts at restricting abortion rights. You know, Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris have been out there talking about this issue plenty over the last several months, but it's no coincidence that this is coming exactly three weeks to go until ballots have to be cast in these midterm elections, and abortion rights are playing a pretty prominent role all across the country. MART\u00cdNEZ: All right, so how has abortion rights been used in these elections that - and has that focus made a difference? MONTANARO: Yeah, I mean, it's really changed so much in these elections. It's become Democrats' sharpest line of attack against Republicans since the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision in June, which overturned Roe and - that had guaranteed the right to an abortion in this country. It's been so salient for Democrats because people were overwhelmingly opposed to the outright overturning of Roe. Now, we have seen Republicans and Democrats take some liberties in ads in many places. They're accusing the other of being extremists. And if you follow these ads, it seems like every candidate either wants no restrictions or no exceptions, even when that's actually not true in lots of cases. But overall, the divide is pretty clear between most Democrats and Republicans. And for Democrats, it's really been energizing. You know, they've seen huge sums of money and activism go into campaigns and a big surge of enthusiasm. When you combine that with how much Republicans were already fired up with them out of power, all signs here are really pointing to a record turnout for this midterm election. MART\u00cdNEZ: I know polls can be tough to trust, but they do continue to show that Americans list inflation as their top concern. So could Democratic candidates then be making a mistake in leaning too much into the abortion messaging? MONTANARO: Yeah, and that's pretty consistent across the board, and it's something that has worried some Democrats, especially in those swing districts. People like Elissa Slotkin, congresswoman in Michigan, have tried to make a point of talking about what she and other Democrats have done, and here's something she said in a recent debate about that. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ELISSA SLOTKIN: I authored a bill that said we should suspend the federal gas tax, pressured the president to open up the strategic national reserves because gas under - the price of gas underlies so much of that inflation. And then taking costs off people's books - right? - passing prescription drug legislation that starts in January that lowers the price of insulin, of drugs in general, for anyone on Medicare. So it's not perfect. If there was a silver bullet on inflation, it would have been fired. MONTANARO: Yeah, so there's the problem there is that it's difficult to make a positive case on inflation when there aren't easy fixes. And Democrats control the White House and Congress. We know presidents get far more credit and far more blame for the economy than they deserve. And people are in a very sour mood right now. Seventy percent of people in our last poll said that the country is headed in the wrong direction. And voters are saying they trust Republicans more on the economy. That makes it much easier for Republicans to simply blame Democrats, especially in those swing districts, most of which are in center-right places. MART\u00cdNEZ: That's NPR's Domenico Montanaro. Thanks a lot. MONTANARO: You're welcome. Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.  All rights reserved.  Visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.

ALPHARETTA, Ga. \u2014 Suburban voters in swing states around the country helped propel President Biden to victory in 2020. That included Georgia, where voters also sent two Democrats to the U.S. Senate for the first time in years. Two years later, without former President Donald Trump on the ballot \u2014 and without a Democratic backlash against him \u2014 it's an open question whether the suburbs will deliver enough votes to help Democrats win again. Over the years, Adam Pye's vote has swung between Democrats and Republicans. This year, he says neither party satisfies him but he will probably wind up voting for the Democrats down the ticket. \"Not something I normally do,\" he says, \"but because of the MAGA stuff, that's kind of a deal breaker for me.\" Pye, his wife and their dog are relaxing on the town green in Alpharetta, an upscale city just outside Atlanta. It's the kind of suburban Republican stronghold where Democrats have been gaining ground lately, especially since Trump first appeared on the ballot eight years ago. Residents relax on the town green in Alpharetta, Ga., an upscale city just outside Atlanta on Sept. 17, 2022.\n                \n                    \n                    Sam Gringlas/WABE\n                    \n                \nhide caption Residents relax on the town green in Alpharetta, Ga., an upscale city just outside Atlanta on Sept. 17, 2022. This election, Republican Gov. Brian Kemp and Democrat Stacey Abrams are competing again after a narrow race in 2018. As the two met on a debate stage Monday night, both were looking to woo independent-minded voters like Breanna Clinton. On the same sunny day on the town green in Alpharetta, Clinton is watching her grandkids play at the nearby splash pad. \"I think inflation is something that will come and go,\" Clinton says. \"The abortion thing is here to stay and I don't like it.\" Democrats hope enough voters will think about the abortion debate that way, too. Republicans, though, say they think inflation will work in their favor. Suburbia is \"where minds may be changing, where you may be able to win over people because of your policies or because of your candidates,\" says Charles Bullock, professor of political science at the University of Georgia. But the suburbs aren't simply blown one way or another by the cycle's political winds. Part of why Georgia's become more purple is because of the million new residents who arrived in the state over the last decade, many of them people of color settling in Atlanta's suburbs. Democrats' campaigns have also successfully turned out irregular and unlikely voters in other parts of the state. \"A lot of people are transplants from all over the place,\" says Nikki Samet, who moved to Alpharetta a year ago from California and has a new baby girl strapped to her chest. Once rich with Republican votes, Atlanta's suburbs catalyzed decades of GOP dominance in Georgia, elevating candidates like former Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich. Over the last few elections, Republicans have hemorrhaged suburban voters not just in Georgia \u2014 but around the country. Nikki Samet, who moved to the Atlanta suburbs a year ago from California, visits the town green on Sept. 17 in Alpharetta, Ga. She says she is most worried about the recent rollback of abortion rights.\n                \n                    \n                    Sam Gringlas/WABE\n                    \n                \nhide caption Nikki Samet, who moved to the Atlanta suburbs a year ago from California, visits the town green on Sept. 17 in Alpharetta, Ga. She says she is most worried about the recent rollback of abortion rights. \"Our community is more diverse and open-minded,\" says Samet, who is most worried about the recent rollback of abortion rights. Democrats often talk about demographics as destiny in Georgia, but so far, this cycle shows that the political climate and the individual candidates matter, too. Across the town green, Krista Wagner is sipping a frozen wine, watching a University of Georgia football game on a big outdoor screen. Wagner voted for Trump in 2016 and then Biden in 2020. \"With somebody saying there's an election that was stolen before the election even happens, I really voted my conscience on that,\" she says. But her flip to the Democrats that year \u2014 it wasn't permanent. Like many voters, both inflation and abortion are top of mind. But Wagner is voting to reelect Kemp for governor, despite her opposition to the restrictive abortion law he signed. \"I'm upset with that. I'm also worried financially about where things are right now,\" she says. \"I know there are other states that will keep [abortion] around, and honestly, if there's a woman who ever needs my help, I'd take her there.\" Wagner isn't voting for all the Republicans, though. \"I do like Warnock, so I'll probably vote for him.\" That's Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock. His opponent is Republican Herschel Walker, the former football star. National Republicans view Georgia's Senate seat as a top target in their crusade to flip the Senate. But Walker has come under scrutiny for allegations of domestic violence and most recently, reports he paid for an ex-girlfriend's abortion, despite his vocal opposition to the procedure. Walker has denied those accounts, and NPR has not independently confirmed them. Krista Wagner is sipping a frozen wine, watching a University of Georgia football game in Alpharetta, Ga. on Sept. 17.

Wagner voted for Trump in 2016 and then Biden in 2020 but her flip to the Democrats that year wasn't permanent. Even before those recent developments, some Republican voters like Greg Minert were hesitant about Walker. \"Some of the allegations against Herschel Walker, that's something I'll have to take a closer look at, because if it's true, that could change my mind,\" Minert says. That's one reason something unusual is happening, especially in Atlanta's wealthy, highly educated suburbs. Some voters are splitting their tickets. \"Although Walker was great at football, I don't know that he's great at politics,\" says Cameron Lewellen, who works in software and is watching his elementary-age son's baseball team take the field in Sandy Springs, another suburban enclave that's trended more Democratic in recent cycles. Most polls show Republican Kemp and Democratic Warnock both leading their challengers. They also suggest Senate nominee Walker is underperforming Kemp on the GOP ticket, especially with women and independents. And compared to fellow Democrat Warnock, polls have found that Abrams hasn't shored up as much support from Black men like Lewellen in her race for governor. Lewellen voted for Biden in 2020, but mostly as a protest vote against Trump. This year, he is picking the Republican for governor and the Democrat for Senate. Lewellen thinks Georgia's blue wave in 2020 wasn't a permanent realignment, especially given the economy. \"I think it was the moment,\" he says. \"Things that I find to be important seem to have been abandoned by the Democratic party.\" At a candidate debate nearby hosted by high school students, Democratic state Sen. Michelle Au is making her case to undecided voters. Au is an anesthesiologist running for the statehouse in Johns Creek, a city with many gated communities and a big population of Asian American voters. \"The way this area has changed, and the way it's changed rapidly, has come under notice after the 2020 election, when Georgia flipped blue, due to turnout in areas like this,\" Au says. Take Georgia's second-largest county, Gwinnett, in suburban Atlanta. Republican Mitt Romney carried the county by 9 points in 2012. Democrat Hillary Clinton took it by 6 points four years later and Abrams won it by 14 in 2018. By 2020, Biden won Gwinnett County by 18 points. Au says trends like that have Republicans' attention. \"I think they're trying to claw back some of the power they realize in retrospect they lost by trying to reach out to some of these new voters in a way they hadn't before,\" she says. Recently, Kemp campaigned on Alpharetta's town green with Virginia's GOP governor, Glenn Youngkin, a departure from the last election when Kemp trained his focus primarily on activating rural voters. Even if Republicans recoup some ground, Au and many political scientists say it won't reverse the overall trend line toward Democrats, as Trumpism lingers over the GOP and the suburbs keep changing.

Minority populations are moving out into new areas. It's not something foreordained by god, but that has been the trend, for the blue to expand further out.\" At the debate, voters Judy Zhu and Wei Kang Ding are still doing their research. \"I think the incumbent is OK, but I don't really like the whole abortion law,\" Ding says. Ding and Zhu are new voters. \"We weren't citizens for the first few years, and of course, Georgia has become more purple, and it became more important for us to vote,\" Zhu says. Georgia's elections have been tight recently, so how suburbanites like Ding and Zhu vote could decide crucial races for Senate and governor. And the results could reveal something more about where American politics are headed in this pivotal moment.",

DePerno is being investigated for his involvement in an alleged scheme to tamper with voting machines. LANSING, Mich. \u2014 An attorney general is often called a state's top law enforcement official. But what happens when a candidate running for that office is someone who could face criminal charges? That's playing out right now in Michigan, where Matthew DePerno, a Trump-backed Republican nominee for state attorney general, is under investigation for an alleged plot to seize and tamper with voting machines. DePerno \u2014 who has pushed former President Donald Trump's false claims of widespread election fraud \u2014 has slammed the probe, which is now led by a special prosecutor. But it leaves him running to lead the agency that could indict him. DePerno rose to fame questioning Trump's 2020 election loss in court. He hadn't yet become the GOP nominee for attorney general when the office began looking into the alleged plot to obtain and tamper with voting machines. Democratic Attorney General Dana Nessel, who's running for reelection against DePerno, says she faced a choice. \"Could I proceed on the other potential defendants and not Matthew DePerno?\" she said in an interview. \"But as it turned out, he was so intertwined with everything that had occurred that it was just impossible to extricate him.\" Nessel said the referral to look into the voting machine tampering came from the Michigan Department of State. She says she then asked for the special prosecutor to avoid a conflict of interest. Her request named DePerno as \"one of the prime instigators of the conspiracy.\" It's not his first brush with controversy. DePerno has falsely said some voting machines were rigged. And he's facing accusations that he's using those baseless claims to raise hundreds of thousands of dollars. \"The things that he's said and the things that he's done should be disqualifying for him,\" Nessel said. \"And I think it's just a matter of people learning about him \u2014 not just Democrats but independents and Republicans. The more you know about Matthew DePerno, the less likely you are to cast your ballot for him.\" Nessel refuses to debate DePerno, partially citing the investigation. She believes he would bring it up and ethical standards from the American Bar Association would prevent her from discussing it, leaving her at a disadvantage. Beyond that, Nessel, who's also the first openly LGBTQ person to serve in statewide office, accuses DePerno of consistently making homophobic and bigoted remarks. \"If he can't raise money to put his own television commercials on the air, I'm not going to give him a forum,\" Nessel said. Michigan Democratic Attorney General Dana Nessel speaks at a campaign rally Sunday in East Lansing, Mich.\n                \n                    \n                    Bill Pugliano/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption In response, DePerno has been calling Nessel a coward. He's framing the investigation as a distraction from substantive issues. \"All of those things we're not talking about because the media wants to ask questions about what Dana Nessel is doing to me \u2014 and usually not in a negative way like in terms of how bad that is for her,\" he said backstage at a recent rally with Trump. DePerno's strategy of late has been to branch out and attack Nessel on issues like abortion and crime. \"Dirty Dana has sat on the sidelines as crime has skyrocketed in this state, and as your next attorney general, I will fight to clean up this state,\" DePerno told the rally crowd. Culture war issues have increasingly played a role in the campaign. While speaking at a conference this summer, Nessel reportedly made an offhand joke about how \"drag queens are fun\" and they would make schools better. At the Oct. 1 Trump rally, DePerno seized upon the remarks. \"She said she wants to put a drag queen in every classroom,\" he said, before asking the crowd, \"Do you think we need drag queens in every classroom?\" When the crowd responded \"no,\" DePerno answered, \"No, people. Not just no \u2014 hell no.\" DePerno's Trump-like ability to rally a crowd has made him popular among grassroots conservatives. But other Republicans are increasingly worried about a candidate who's under active investigation. \"Republicans basically had the ball in their court and the mandate was just, don't be crazy. And I feel like that's the trap people have fallen into,\" said former state Rep. Aaron Miller. He says Nessel, who narrowly won in 2018, should have been vulnerable. She's made her own headlines for stances like refusing to enforce Michigan's anti-abortion law and for occasionally going off script. Still, polling has shown Nessel consistently up and she's been dominating the fundraising battle. It's unclear what exactly would happen if DePerno wins and is subsequently indicted and convicted. Michigan election law says the attorney general position becomes vacant upon the officeholder's conviction of an \"infamous crime.\" While that's not spelled out in statute, the Detroit Free Press has noted that it's been historically interpreted as a crime punishable by a sentence in state prison. Some have wondered about the long-term effect candidates with a track record of denying election results \u2014 like DePerno \u2014 will have on the Republican Party. University of Michigan professor Walter Mebane says the future of the GOP is still undetermined. \"Parties can adapt pretty quickly,\" he said. \"You can throw out the people you formerly were supporting and get in new people and people can suddenly pretend they didn't know who they were yesterday.\" But he says election denialism must be dealt with now.",

            "article_content": "The congressional committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection wrapped up its hearings Friday.  MICHEL MARTIN, HOST: The congressional committee investigating the January 6 coup attempt on the Capitol wrapped up its hearings this week. Toward the end, the committee voted to subpoena former President Trump to testify. Here's Congresswoman Liz Cheney, a Republican from Wyoming and vice chair of the committee. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LIZ CHENEY: The vast weight of evidence presented so far has shown us that the central cause of January 6 was one man, Donald Trump, whom many others followed. None of this would have happened without him. MARTIN: But we also wondered what effect, if any, the hearings are having on the midterms. To help answer that, let's bring in NPR senior political editor and correspondent Domenico Montanaro. Domenico, welcome back. Thanks for joining us. DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Hey there, Michel. MARTIN: So the January 6 committee certainly made a lot of news. There were lots of former Trump administration officials testifying about what was going on behind the scenes that day, what the former president was doing and what he was not doing. But, Domenico, do we have a sense if any of it has made a difference with voters? MONTANARO: Well, you really have to think about who's watching these hearings. You know, our polling has found that it's Democrats who are mostly paying the closest attention. And we had seen over the summer, with the deluge of evidence from the hearings, that Trump's grip on the Republican Party did appear to be loosening some. But after that FBI search at Trump's Florida home, Republicans snapped back to Trump's corner, and overall, this just isn't the top issue in these campaigns. Inflation is the dominant concern. Democrats have successfully used abortion rights as a way to fire up their base. So that's what, really, these campaigns are focused on. MARTIN: So let's talk about the midterm elections more broadly. This week also saw two high-profile debates. So let's start in Wisconsin. Their incumbent Republican Senator Ron Johnson is up for reelection. He's being challenged by the current lieutenant governor, Mandela Barnes. The race is very contentious, and it played on the debate stage. What happened? MONTANARO: Yeah. It's gotten pretty ugly. When the candidates were asked to say something nice about each other toward the end of the debate, Barnes said he respected that Johnson is a family man. But Johnson, he just couldn't help himself. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) RON JOHNSON: I appreciate the fact that Lieutenant Governor Barnes had loving parents, a schoolteacher, father worked third shift, so he had, you know, good upbringing. I guess what puzzles me about that is with that upbringing, why is he turned against America? I mean, why does he find America awful? (BOOING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Somehow... MONTANARO: So you can hear there that drew some boos. And, you know, even Trump - I was struck by this - you know, was able to say something nice about Hillary Clinton in a 2016 debate. He said she's a fighter who doesn't quit. You know, this has been a real problem for Johnson. He's just not well liked throughout the state. That's made him pretty vulnerable. But this is one that's expected to be close because of Wisconsin's most - you know, it's one of the most sharply divided, politically, states in the country. MARTIN: So another contentious race, Georgia - we talked about that briefly just a few minutes ago. Incumbent Democratic Senator Raphael Warnock facing off against Republican nominee, the challenger, Georgia football star Herschel Walker - tell us a little bit more about Friday night's debate. MONTANARO: Yeah. Obviously abortion is the big issue here because it was the controversy coming in about an allegation that Walker paid an ex-girlfriend to have an abortion. During the debate, he again said she's lying. But the divide between Walker and Warnock on abortion was pretty clear. Warnock has said before that a patient's room is too small for a woman, her doctor and the government. Let's listen to part of their exchange. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) RAPHAEL WARNOCK: The women of Georgia deserves a senator who will stand with them. I trust women more than I trust politicians. HERSCHEL WALKER: May I respond? UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Very quickly, Mr. Walker. WALKER: You know, it is - and I heard about him. I heard he was a neat talker. But did he not mention that there's a baby in that room as well? MONTANARO: You know, this debate was a big moment for Walker. Overall, Republicans say they think that Walker did a good-enough job tying Warnock to Biden and his Democratic policies, which is what they think gives him the best chance to win in this state where Biden's pretty unpopular now. MARTIN: That's NPR senior political editor and correspondent Domenico Montanaro. Domenico, thanks. MONTANARO: Thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "In one of the most watched Senate contests in the country, Sen. Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.) and Republican nominee  Herschel Walker faced off on the debate stage in Savannah.  SCOTT SIMON, HOST: The race in Georgia could determine control of the U.S. Senate. Last night in Savannah, Democratic Senator Raphael Warnock faced off against Republican Herschel Walker - the only debate between the two before the election - and as expected, the debate got sharp. Here's Senator Warnock. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) RAPHAEL WARNOCK: We will see time and time again tonight, as we've already seen, that my opponent has a problem with the truth. SIMON: And here is Walker's response, later. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) HERSCHEL WALKER: Do not bear false witness, Senator. Do not bear false witness. SIMON: Georgia Public Broadcasting's Stephen Fowler watched the debate and joins us. Stephen, thanks for being with us. STEPHEN FOWLER, BYLINE: Good morning. SIMON: This is the first time the candidates have met face-to-face during the campaign. Was anything revealed that was new or substantive about either of them? FOWLER: So not really. We knew going into this that Warnock would tout his bipartisan work with people like Texas Senator Ted Cruz and Senator Tommy Tuberville of Alabama and his measures to lower the cost of health care for seniors. That's exactly what we heard from him, with Warnock deflecting questions about if he felt responsible for inflation with a list of accomplishments he did to keep individual costs down. Now, Walker intentionally set his bar low, saying he's not that smart and that Warnock, a pastor, would out-debate him. That bar was cleared. We also knew that Walker's strategy was going to be to tie Warnock to President Joe Biden, who is deeply unpopular here, and say inflation, issues with the economy, crime and other things are the fault of Democratic control of Congress for the last two years. There weren't really many opportunities for the candidates to go deep on issues, given the debate format. And moderators did lose control of the candidates bickering back and forth a couple of times throughout the night. SIMON: Of course, Mr. Walker has campaigned as being unalterably opposed to antiabortion, saying it is never acceptable under any circumstance. And, of course, recent reporting from The Daily Beast includes an accusation that, nevertheless, he paid for the abortion of a former girlfriend. Did this come up? FOWLER: Surprisingly, Scott, barely. Walker was asked by the moderators about the story and allegation, and Herschel Walker said, yet again, it wasn't true and that he wasn't backing down from saying it wasn't true. And there wasn't really a follow-up question. And Senator Warnock didn't really push it, either. What is notable is that Walker backtracked on his absolute stance on abortion. He previously expressed support for a federal national ban, but then had this to say. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) WALKER: I say I support the heartbeat bill, and I say I support the Georgia heartbeat bill because that's the bill of the people from Governor Kemp. FOWLER: That's Georgia's new abortion law, which takes effect about six weeks into pregnancy, before many know they're pregnant. It was held up for several years by the courts but took effect after this summer's Supreme Court ruling. And Georgia's law does make exceptions for rape, incest and cases where the pregnancies are considered medical emergencies. It was one of the few really meaningful exchanges throughout the debate, and on an issue that's top of mind for many voters here. SIMON: I don't have to tell you, Stephen, it's not only a close Senate contest, but a lot of people feel it could hold the balance of power in the U.S. Senate. And a lot of attention and money is coming in from across the country. Tell us what's at stake again. FOWLER: Sure, because, like you said, once again, control of the U.S. Senate could come down to Georgia voters. Republicans are all in on Walker, in spite of his campaign controversies, because, at the end of the day, he could be the 51st seat for them and give them power in the second half of President Biden's first term. Even though Georgia voted for Biden in 2020, the state is still run by Republicans. So Democrats think a Warnock win could help flip races like governor and secretary of state. It's also entirely possible, Scott, that none of these key races here see anyone get above the majority threshold needed to win outright. There's a Libertarian candidate who's actually somewhat popular, as people who don't want to vote for Herschel Walker and won't vote for Raphael Warnock are seeking a third option. So we could see an early December runoff race extend election season even further. SIMON: Stephen Fowler of Georgia Public Broadcasting. Thanks so much for being with us. FOWLER: Thank you.

            "article_content": "Colorado's new congressional district was drawn to be highly competitive. Its election pits a Latina Democrat against a Republican who became a politician to fight environmental injustice.  SACHA PFEIFFER, HOST: The road to control Congress may run through a new House district in Colorado. An independent commission drew new political lines and made the seat one of the most evenly split in the nation. Colorado Public Radio's Bente Birkeland reports. BENTE BIRKELAND, BYLINE: Colorado gained an eighth congressional seat because of population growth. It spans the suburbs north of Denver through booming bedroom communities, farm fields and thick clusters of oil and gas wells. The district is also the most diverse in Colorado. Nearly 40% of the population is Latino. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BARBARA KIRKMEYER: They are a part of the fabric of our community, a fabric of our community that is rich with their heritage, which has become our heritage. BIRKELAND: That's Republican candidate Barbara Kirkmeyer at the launch of the Republican National Committee's Hispanic Community Center in this new district. It's part of a nationwide GOP effort to reach voters of color. Kirkmeyer says voters of all backgrounds tell her their top issue this election is cost of living. KIRKMEYER: It's the No. 1 issue that people bring up. It's the No. 1 issue that people bring up at birthday parties, at backyard barbecues, at family gatherings. It's how much it's costing for food, for shelter, for energy, for transportation. That's it. BIRKELAND: It's top of mind for Desiree and Jeremiah Vigil, who live in this district and are in their 40s. Desiree is a nurse. DESIREE VIGIL: Housing market is through the roof, making it unaffordable for my kids to buy a house now. BIRKELAND: Desiree is a Republican. Her husband, Jeremiah, a loan officer, says he's a moderate. JEREMIAH VIGIL: I think probably housing market is big for me; infrastructure as well and inflation, obviously. BIRKELAND: Kirkmeyer's opponent, Democrat Yadira Caraveo, is a pediatrician and, like Kirkmeyer, a state lawmaker. Caraveo's parents immigrated from Mexico before she was born. She says her dad supported the family on a construction worker's salary, something she sees as increasingly out of reach for many families. Caraveo pushes back against attacks that Democrats are the cause of rising costs and increasing crime. YADIRA CARAVEO: I think it's easy to buy into kind of the fear mongering that the other side does, where they point out just the negatives. But it's really important to look at the specifics of what we have done. BIRKELAND: Caraveo highlights moves by Colorado's Democratic-controlled government to close some tax loopholes and reduce health care costs. CARAVEO: I think that I have a true focus on working families, you know? I come from one. I have taken care of thousands of working families in this district as a pediatrician. BIRKELAND: Her opponent, Kirkmeyer, also has working-class roots. And before entering politics, she owned a dairy farm and flower shop. Both women, by and large, follow the positions of their political parties, whether it's gun control, government spending, climate or abortion. Colorado voters have repeatedly rejected restrictions on the procedure, and Democrats recently codified abortion protections into state law. But Kirkmeyer doesn't believe the 2020 election was stolen, and she supports gay marriage. High-profile members of both political parties have campaigned with Kirkmeyer and Caraveo. Outside groups are also pouring millions of dollars into trying to sway voters in a race that could go either way. For NPR News, I'm Bente Birkeland in Denver.

LIZ LEBRON: Abortion was not really on our radar. And all of a sudden, after the leak, it started popping up, and it has not slowed down. PFEIFFER: Maria, when you say disinformation, what exactly were they seeing? GODOY: You know, it really runs the gamut from posts that say abortion is no longer legal - even in places where it is, in fact, still legal - to posts that falsely claimed the procedure isn't safe. Lebron told me that these falsehoods are being shared by some popular Spanish language accounts with tens of thousands of followers. And the fact is, right now, because there is so much confusion because state laws are changing, this kind of misinformation spreads easily because people are looking for answers. So they share false posts, thinking that it's true. PFEIFFER: And are you finding that people who knowingly post this misinformation are doing so to capitalize on all this confusion? GODOY: Yeah, that's exactly right. You know, and this is playing out in an especially pernicious way when it comes to misinformation aimed at attracting Latino voters. Here's an example that Liz Lebron told me about in which misinformation showed up on a Spanish language site that targeted Florida Representative Val Demings. She's the Democratic candidate for Senate running against Republican Senator Marco Rubio. LEBRON: There is a group, Floridianos del Marco (ph), and they posted to their 11,000 followers that Val Demings wants to fund abortions with taxpayer money until the moment of birth. And it's like, oh, goodness. GODOY: Now, this is not true. Demings is clearly on the record saying she supports the right to abortion only up to the viability of the fetus, which doctors generally put at about 24 weeks of pregnancy. But the thing is - and this is important - polls show abortion has risen in importance among Latino voters in recent months. And while many of these voters support the right to legal abortion, there are, of course, those who don't or are on the fence. And those are the votes possibly up for grabs. PFEIFFER: And this is an issue that isn't just about influencing elections. There are other consequences here, basically. GODOY: Well, right. There are concerns that this rampant disinformation could also lead to serious health consequences. PFEIFFER: And spell some of those out. What kind of health consequences? GODOY: Well, so I spoke with Dr. Melissa Simon. She's an OB-GYN at Northwestern Medicine in Chicago. She's Latina, and she says she's seen a lot of fear fanned by disinformation among her Spanish-speaking immigrant patients. MELISSA SIMON: I see patients that are fearing the repercussions of getting an abortion, not to just themselves, but to their family and loved ones. GODOY: Simon told me about a pregnant teenager who came to see her with her mother, who is an undocumented immigrant. The daughter was scared that if she got an abortion, it might somehow end up getting her mother detained or even deported. Simon is worried these fears will keep some people from seeking the medical care they need. PFEIFFER: That's NPR's Maria Godoy. Thank you very much. GODOY: Thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.

            "article_content": "Two of the closest U.S. Senate races in the midterms in November are in Arizona and Nevada. The Senate is 50-50, and Republicans aim to gain an advantage.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Throughout this month, Americans are voting in the midterm elections. LEILA FADEL, HOST: Republicans are considered favorites to capture the House. Democrats are favored to keep the Senate. But nothing is really predictable with so much on the line. Democrats are hoping abortion and other issues will limit the losses often suffered by the party in power. And Republicans had hoped to make the election a referendum on President Biden, but his predecessor has pushed to make the election about himself. Former President Trump campaigned in Arizona and Nevada over the weekend. He favors Senate candidates there who embraced his false claims about the election he lost. And he praised the size of the crowd that attacked the U.S. Capitol on January 6. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DONALD TRUMP: Do you know the biggest crowd I've ever seen? January 6. (CHEERING) TRUMP: And you never hear that. It was the biggest - and they were there largely to protest a corrupt and rigged and stolen election. FADEL: All of that, of course, is not true. INSKEEP: NPR senior political editor and correspondent Domenico Montanaro is covering the midterms. Hey there, Domenico. DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Hey, Steve. INSKEEP: OK, So the former president went to Nevada and Arizona. What's the importance of those states? MONTANARO: Well, these are two of the closest Senate races in the country with Democratic incumbents Catherine Cortez Masto in Nevada and Mark Kelly in Arizona. You know, the Senate is 50/50. Republicans need to net just one seat to take control of the Senate. And these are two of their top targets. You know, Democrats are playing defense, but how far these Republican candidates have had to go to get Trump's endorsement is a real wild card. Trump's far less popular with swing voters, independents, Latinos and Asian American voters, who are all key in both of these purple states. INSKEEP: I just want to note how unusual it is that Donald Trump is campaigning in this midterm after his election defeat. Normally, the former president is off the stage. The current president faces a kind of referendum in the midterms. And very often, the president will lose some ground, showing a little bit of dissatisfaction with what's going on. Republicans would love to make this a referendum on Joe Biden, but Donald Trump keeps saying, Wait. Wait. What about me? It's about me. It's about me. MONTANARO: Yeah, I mean, look. He's a factor here. And Democrats believe highlighting Trump's ties to these Republican candidates and abortion rights can really help them. But Republicans are using crime and the cost of living against Democrats. And the economy really is a main concern in many places, especially in a place like Nevada, which has a high white, working-class population and a lot of working-class Latinos. Republicans really see an opportunity with Latinos because of that. INSKEEP: So there's a handful of states that can decide control of the Senate. Trump was in two of them that you mentioned, Arizona, Nevada. There's a couple of others, like - I don't know - Wisconsin, Georgia, Pennsylvania. And then there is Ohio, where Republicans were expected to walk. And the Republican nominee, J.D. Vance for Senate, is instead facing a tough challenge from Tim Ryan, the Democrat. MONTANARO: Yeah, it's really a great example of a place where Republican ad spending has made a huge difference. You know, Ryan had a big lead, and that's now shrunk on the heels of the Senate Leadership Fund, a group tied to Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell spending $52 million in just the last two weeks in some key races to boost Republicans. It shouldn't need to be that way in Ohio for Republicans, a state that's leaned pretty heavily Republican. Because of that Democrat, Tim Ryan's using - is trying to appeal to the middle. Listen to part of this ad with Ryan and his wife, Andrea. (SOUNDBITE OF POLITICAL AD) TIM RYAN: But if we have 10 conversations in one day... ANDREA ZETTS: ...And we agree on seven... RYAN: ...We crack a bottle of wine. ZETTS: Yes, we do. (SOUNDBITE OF WINE BOTTLE OPENING) RYAN: The same goes for the country. We have to stop the stupid fights... ZETTS: ...To find some common ground... RYAN: ...And be Americans first. ZETTS: Now, that I can agree with. MONTANARO: You know, that's really something we've seen in places where candidates are running against the grain. And, you know, tonight's debate and all of these debates down the stretch in Ohio and other places will be critical because for many viewers, this will be the first and only times they'll be able to hear these candidates outside their filtered ads. INSKEEP: NPR's Domenico Montanaro, thanks so much. MONTANARO: You're welcome. Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "Vice President Harris has held meeting after meeting on abortion rights since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. NPR sat in a recent sessions to find out more about her role on this issue.  JUANA SUMMERS, HOST: For Democratic and independent voters, abortion is one of the top motivating issues in the midterm elections. Vice President Harris has been elevating that issue from the White House, hosting dozens of events and traveling around the country. NPR's Deepa Shivaram followed Harris to Connecticut this week for one of those conversations. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Hello - last name. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: (Inaudible). DEEPA SHIVARAM, BYLINE: It's a dreary afternoon in New Britain, and student volunteers at Central Connecticut State University are checking in guests. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Just down the hall and to the right. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: Oh, OK. SHIVARAM: Inside, Congresswoman Jahana Hayes is highlighting an issue that's central to her campaign. JAHANA HAYES: As women's rights are being eviscerated all over the country, it is critical that we take action to enshrine women's reproductive rights into law. SHIVARAM: This is normally a safe Democratic district, but Hayes is in a tight race this year, one of several that Democrats need to win to try to hold on to the House. She brought in a well-known guest to help make her case. HAYES: I think that our vice president of the United States of America is uniquely qualified to weigh in on this conversation. SHIVARAM: The conversation is about protecting reproductive rights. And Harris has been weighing in - repeatedly. This was one of more than 20 events on abortion rights that the vice president has led since May, when the draft opinion reversing Roe v. Wade was first leaked. VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: This is admirable to get out here and speak with force and feeling about this issue. SHIVARAM: She's been taking this message to North Carolina, Indiana and Florida. And back at the White House, she's been bringing together all kinds of stakeholders - lawmakers, faith leaders, health experts - to listen and to energize. JOCELYN FRYE: She is very much involved in the conversation. She is - these are not - this is not a meeting where she's just reading talking points. SHIVARAM: That's Jocelyn Frye, a Biden administration ally who leads an advocacy group, the National Partnership for Women and Families. She was in one of Harris's meetings last month. FRYE: You know, we've all been in those meetings when people are sort of just going through the motions. And this was not that type of a meeting. SHIVARAM: It's not just abortion that Harris addresses in these events. She says that the Supreme Court decision threatens rights for LGBTQ people and people of color, and she sees an opportunity to bring these fights together. HARRIS: Let's organize. Let's link arms and do what we need to do, including in the next 34 days. SHIVARAM: That message resonated with Utah state representative Andrea Ramos (ph). She was at a roundtable with Harris and other Latina state lawmakers back in August. ANDREA RAMOS: It was really, for me, not only a call of action for abortion access and what we could and couldn't do but really a call of action just to, you know, remind people this is the midterms, but there's a lot at stake. SHIVARAM: And with just over a month until Election Day, the White House says Harris will continue to hold these kinds of events, and will take her message to states with competitive races.

            "article_content": "NPR's Mary Louise Kelly talks with Axios reporter Emma Hurt about how recent allegations against Georgia's senate candidate Herschel Walker are affecting his chances with voters.  MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: It has been a rough week for Herschel Walker. The Georgia Republican Senate candidate, Walker has run a campaign emphasizing family values. He says he is against abortion and has pledged to support a national abortion ban. Now he is facing accusations that he paid for an abortion for a former girlfriend. This is something Walker denies. He is also facing renewed allegations of domestic violence from his son, Christian Walker. So how might these revelations affect a tight race in a key state? We'll put that question to Emma Hurt, who has been covering the Walker campaign for Axios. Hey, Emma. EMMA HURT: Hey, Mary Louise. KELLY: Start with the tweets this week from Walker's son, Christian, who's been a regular on social media. He has not been shy about sharing his own conservative views, but he has steered clear of criticizing his father's campaign in the past. That changed this week. What'd he say? HURT: Oh, yeah, in a big way. And actually, Walker, you know, has sporadically spoken for his father's campaign. He introduced him at a fundraiser back in December. But things really took a dramatic turn this week. And it's kind of hard to know where to begin. But basically, he accused his dad of being a liar, saying everything has been a lie. All of it's been a lie and you've known it. You have no idea what me and my mom have survived. We could have ended this on day one. I haven't told any stories. I'm just saying, don't lie. And so while these allegations, as you outlined, were a blow to the campaign, it's these tweets and these - this coming from his son that... KELLY: From his son. HURT: ...Has really taken things to the next level. KELLY: Yeah. I mean, voters in Georgia have been hearing opposition ads for a while now in which Walker's ex-wife accuses him of domestic violence. Has Walker responded to any of this? HURT: Right. And that's Christian Walker's son, actually. KELLY: Mom, yeah. HURT: And those ads, as you say, have - sorry, Christian Walker's mother. KELLY: Yeah. HURT: Excuse me. And those ads, as you say, have been running a lot. But this is something - this specific allegation - this specific report by his ex-wife is something that's been out there for a long time. That interview featuring her is one they did jointly. He wrote about it in a book, and he has attributed these episodes to a past mental illness. And so there has been some question about whether that was - that's been neutralizing to this attack, that people understand that he struggled with a mental illness. He has told me that he has had treatment and that's long in the past. But there have been other allegations by other women of domestic violence that he has denied. And now this is just adding to the pile of this drip, drip, drip of stories about Walker's past that, you know, Republicans were worried about for a while. But here we're seeing it come out. KELLY: Dripping becoming a flow. Let me turn you to the other major controversy this week, which is the allegation that Walker paid for another woman, a former girlfriend, to obtain an abortion. Abortion is a key issue in this election in Georgia. It's a key issue in elections all over the country. Walker, as we said, publicly opposes the procedure. How might this play out for his campaign? HURT: Again, it's early for us - it's a little early for us to tell. I mean, we do know that this has dropped a bomb, really, in Georgia political circles, just because, as you said, the saliency of this issue right now and Walker's really staunch position as anti-abortion without exceptions. But the question becomes if, you know, these attacks, which are estimated $50 million worth of negative ads have already been spent on Walker, does this just to many voters feel like another attack by, you know, the, quote, \"liberal media?\" Does it really change any minds? And that is the question. In, you know, conversations with anti-abortion voters and what we've seen from the big national groups, they're sticking by him. But, you know, it's those undecided voters. It's - in such a tight state, as you know, anyone's mind changing can make a big difference here. KELLY: That's interesting. I was going to ask you - because Republican lawmakers have mostly continued to stand behind Walker, and I was going to ask about Republican voters in Georgia. It sounds like the answer is watch this space. HURT: Yeah, I think so. I mean, but that being said, again, we live in sort of a political world here with lots of strategists and politicians and journalists. The question is, how does this news resonate down to voters? And a lot of the ways that that does is through attack ads. So we'll see what those look like. KELLY: Emma Hurt in Georgia - she's a reporter at Axios - thanks. HURT: Thank you.

He called the accusation a \"flat-out lie.\"\n                \n                    \n                    Bill Barrow/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption A report published late Monday alleges that GOP Senate candidate Herschel Walker, who has vehemently opposed abortion rights, paid for an abortion for his girlfriend in 2009. He called the accusation a \"flat-out lie.\" The national Republican Party apparatus is standing behind its U.S. Senate candidate in Georgia, Herschel Walker, following a report in the Daily Beast that alleges he paid for a girlfriend's abortion in 2009. Walker, a vocal abortion opponent, called the report a \"flat-out\" lie in a statement posted on Twitter. \"I never asked anyone to get an abortion,\" Walker told Fox News shortly after the story broke Monday night. \"I never paid for an abortion. And it's a lie. And I'm going to continue to fight. They want this seat. Right now, they've energized me even more.\" NPR has not independently confirmed the account. The Daily Beast granted the woman anonymity to protect her privacy. The report says she provided a copy of a check from Walker, a receipt from an abortion clinic and a get-well card he allegedly signed. Walker told Fox News he sends money and get-well cards to a lot of people. Georgia is one of the GOP's top prospects to pick up a seat in the Senate. \"When the Democrats are losing, as they are right now, they lie and cheat and smear their opponents,\" Sen. Rick Scott, chair of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, wrote in a statement. \"Herschel has denied these allegations and the NRSC and Republicans stand with him, and Georgians will stand with him too.\" Former President Donald Trump, who has endorsed Walker, issued a statement saying he does not doubt Walker's denial of the story. \"With all that Herschel has accomplished, when you come from Georgia, and you see the name Herschel Walker when voting, it will be very hard to resist,\" Trump wrote. \"Don't!\" In May, WABE asked Walker to describe his stance on abortion. \"There's no exception in my mind. Like I said, I believe in life,\" Walker said. Abortion has played a prominent role in the Georgia midterms since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. In 2019, Georgia's Republican governor, Brian Kemp, who's up for reelection this fall, signed a law banning most abortions after about six weeks with few exceptions. The law just took effect this summer, following the Supreme Court's ruling. But Walker has gone even further, pledging to support a national abortion ban. At a Rosh Hashanah campaign event on Monday, Walker's Democratic opponent, Sen. Raphael Warnock, reaffirmed his support for abortion rights. Walker, a onetime University of Georgia football star, is a legend in Georgia, and he sailed to victory in Georgia's May primary. But a few weeks out from Election Day, Walker is trailing Warnock in most polls. Walker has a history of misleading or false statements. He has exaggerated his academic, business and philanthropic records. Since he launched his campaign, several additional children he did not disclose to the public or, reportedly to his campaign, have come to light. Walker's son, who regularly shares his conservative viewpoints on social media and has not openly criticized his father's campaign in the past, tweeted \"I'm done,\" along with a thread of messages detailing his father's allegedly destructive behavior toward his family. \"I don't care about someone who has a bad past and takes accountability,\" Christian Walker wrote. \"But how DARE YOU LIE and act as though you're some \"moral, Christian, upright man.\" You've lived a life of DESTROYING other people's lives.  How dare you.\" Walker has spoken about accusations of domestic violence against his ex-wife, citing mental illness, saying he is better now and that the two remain friends. Opposition ads featuring Walker's ex-wife talking in an interview about how he held a gun to her head and threatened to kill her have blanketed Georgia's airwaves for weeks. \"A month ago, I thought Walker was a sure thing,\" conservative radio host Erick Erickson wrote in his newsletter Tuesday. \"Now, I think he is less likely to win unless he mounts an immediate response. Georgia is not a deeply red state, and even Alabama elected Doug Jones instead of Roy Moore.\" In 2017, Alabama elected Democrat Doug Jones over Republican Roy Moore, who had been accused of sexual misconduct. While Walker quickly consolidated support with base Republican voters in the primary, some independent-minded suburban voters who will vote Republican for governor and other races say they will vote for Warnock, the libertarian candidate or leave the Senate race blank. \"It troubles me a little bit, some of the allegations against Herschel Walker,\" Republican Greg Minert said last month. \"So if it's true, it could change my mind.\" Last cycle, Democratic victories in Georgia's Senate races determined control of the U.S. Senate, so the outcome of this election could also have national implications.",

On the campaign trail, Walker has advocated for a complete abortion ban.  AMART\u00cdNEZ, HOST: Georgia U.S. Senate candidate Herschel Walker, who in his campaign has called for a complete abortion ban without exceptions, is denying a report that he paid for an ex-girlfriend's abortion in 2009. Here he is last night on Fox News. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) HERSCHEL WALKER: I never asked anyone to get an abortion. I never paid for an abortion. And it's a lie. And I'm going to continue to fight. You know, I tell you, that's what they want. They want this seat. But right now, they've energized me even more. MART\u00cdNEZ: The story was first reported by The Daily Beast. A woman who asked not to be identified for privacy reasons showed reporters there a receipt from an abortion provider and a copy of a check signed by Walker. NPR has no independent confirmation of the story. Politics reporter Sam Gringlas of member station WABE has been covering the story. Sam, The Daily Beast says they've actually seen a $700 check written by Herschel Walker and sent to the woman in the get-well card. Did Walker address that? SAM GRINGLAS, BYLINE: Well, Walker told Fox News that he sends money and get-well cards to a lot of people. On Twitter, he called the story a flat-out lie. And for now, a spokesman for the National Republican Senatorial Committee has told reporters that they are standing behind him. On Monday night, Walker's opponent, Senator Raphael Warnock, was asked about the story at a Rosh Hashana campaign event, and he reiterated his support for abortion rights. MART\u00cdNEZ: How much of an issue is abortion in this race? GRINGLAS: It's a big issue. Since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, it has been major. Georgia's governor, Republican Brian Kemp, signed a law in 2019 that bans most abortions after about six weeks in Georgia. It just took effect after the Supreme Court decision this summer. But Walker has actually gone further, explicitly supporting a more stringent national law. And I asked him about his stance in May. And here's what he said. WALKER: There is no exception in my mind. I can say I believe in life. GRINGLAS: So no exceptions for... WALKER: And I do - no exceptions. I believe in life. GRINGLAS: And while inflation and the economy are top of mind for many voters, this story could certainly drive abortion further into the spotlight. MART\u00cdNEZ: All right, so Walker denies the allegations. Then on Twitter, his son called him out over other aspects of his personal conduct. GRINGLAS: Yeah, so some of Walker's history has spilled into public view even further as the story broke. His son, who is an outspoken conservative, until now has supported his dad's run, posted a string of really critical tweets, writing, quote, \"I'm done.\" Walker has a track record of exaggerating his business and academic history. He has talked about some of these accusations from his ex-wife of domestic violence, and he cites his struggles with mental illness, saying that he's better now. MART\u00cdNEZ: And it turns out this is one of the closest Senate races out there. Herschel Walker narrowly trails. You mentioned senator - incumbent Senator Warnock. Could these accusations affect the outcome of this race? GRINGLAS: Well, Herschel Walker sailed to victory in the primary. His support with base Republican voters has been quite enthusiastic. But I've also spent a lot of time lately in Atlanta's suburbs, and I've recently met some voters who will vote Republican for governor and other races, but want to vote for Warnock or the Libertarian or leave the race blank for Senate. This is Republican voter Greg Minor (ph). GREG MINOR: Troubles me a little bit, you know, some of the allegations against Herschel Walker. So that's someone I should take a closer look at. If it's true, that could change my mind. GRINGLAS: And remember, Georgia's Senate race determined control of the U.S. Senate last cycle, so the outcome of this election could have national implications.

A MART\u00cdNEZ, HOST: In Brazil, the presidential race heads to a runoff at the end of this month after the far-right incumbent, President Jair Bolsonaro, did far better than expected. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, the leftist former president, came in first but did not win outright. He needed a majority and fell just a bit short. It was a polarized election between two men considered populists, one on the left, one on the right. MART\u00cdNEZ: NPR South America correspondent Carrie Kahn joins us now from Rio de Janeiro with the latest. Carrie, there was a much tighter race than expected. So what happened. CARRIE KAHN, BYLINE: Two things. The right in Brazil came out in big numbers and sent the race to a runoff. And the pollsters were wrong. They were just wrong. Brazil's major polls had predicted a double-digit win by former president and leftist Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. Many Bolsonaro voters may have switched at the last minute or just wouldn't admit voting for Bolsonaro to pollsters. We don't know. He's just a provocative, brash, far-right nationalist here. He rails against political correctness, makes homophobic comments. He's criticized for bungling the COVID pandemic. And under his tenure, destruction of the Amazon rainforest has skyrocketed. But his base is loyal. They came out for him, like Juthe Cardoza (ph). Here's what she said. JUTHE CARDOZA: (Non-English language spoken). KAHN: \"We Brazilians love Bolsonaro as much as you Americans love Trump.\" Trump is a political ally of the president here, who takes many cues from the former U.S. president. He cries fraud a lot and says the media lies and pollsters are wrong. And last night, he got to say he was right about the polls. MART\u00cdNEZ: What about da Silva? What has he said about his performance yesterday? KAHN: He spoke to supporters in a very subdued rally after the final vote count was in. The 76-year-old leftist said he's prepared for the runoff and a chance to debate Bolsonaro one on one. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LUIZ INACIO LULA DA SILVA: (Non-English language spoken). KAHN: He says the struggle will continue until the final victory for Brazil. Da Silva is remembered here for his big government spending that really helped lift many people out of poverty. An outright victory for him last night would have been a spectacular political comeback. After his presidency, he was jailed on corruption charges in 2018. He was released from jail and later had his conviction annulled. But many voters don't trust him or his party. MART\u00cdNEZ: Now, the act of actually going to the polls, Carrie, how did that go yesterday? And what expectations about the next four weeks are there leading up to the runoff? KAHN: Well, it's very long lines in polling stations here in Rio de Janeiro. It's going to be a tense and intense next four weeks until the October 30 runoff. Brazil is very polarized right now. These two men have outlined very distinct plans for the country. Look; generally, the poor went for da Silva and see economics as the main issue for them. Brazil's economy is sputtering still after the pandemic. And Bolsonaro supporters generally are more well-off. And they really go for his family values, anti-abortion, pro-gun message. He speaks a lot about the political left turn in Latin America, especially in places like Nicaragua, Venezuela, Colombia and Chile. And if allowed to come to Brazil, he says the, quote, \"communists will erode those liberties.\" And as he repeatedly says, he's the defender of God, family, homeland and liberty.

            "article_content": "Did a Florida county wait too long to issue evacuation orders as Hurricane Ian loomed? Brazil's presidential election goes to a runoff later this month. The Supreme Court begins a new term Monday.  A MART\u00cdNEZ, HOST: Officials in Lee County, Fla., issued mandatory evacuation orders only one day before Hurricane Ian hit land, despite days of warnings beforehand. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: So did that decision contribute to the death toll? So far, we know at least 81 people died in Florida during the storm and its aftermath, and of those, 42 - more than half - were in Lee County. MART\u00cdNEZ: NPR's Brian Mann has been following the story. Brian, so take us through the timeline. When did officials in Lee County start telling people they had to go? BRIAN MANN, BYLINE: Yeah. So three days before the storm hit, the National Hurricane Center sent an advisory saying Ian could drive this devastating storm surge, up to 7 feet of water, in this area around Lee County. Then two days before landfall - this is last Monday - the center issued an official warning, and it appears, A, that that warning should have triggered a mandatory evacuation order under Lee County's own emergency management plan. But that's not what happened. While at least one neighboring county did issue a mandatory evacuation order on Monday, Lee County officials held off. They delayed until the next day, Tuesday morning. The storm and the flood of seawater slammed ashore Wednesday, when a lot of people were still out on those remote barrier islands, vulnerable. MART\u00cdNEZ: So why didn't Lee County follow their own emergency management plan? MANN: Yeah, the chair of Lee County Board of Commissioners, Cecil Pendergrass, was asked about this at a press conference yesterday. He said they believed the brunt of the storm would hit elsewhere along the coast. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CECIL PENDERGRASS: Seventy-two hours before the storm, we still were not in the cone - Lee County wasn't. So the emergency - state emergency director said that. We noticed that locally. We were working off of data. MANN: But here's the thing, A - that forecast cone Pendergrass mentions there, that's only the center of the storm. Ian, of course, was a massive hurricane. Its deadly power and the surge of water were predicted by the National Hurricane Center to extend well beyond that path. MART\u00cdNEZ: Now, what does Pendergrass think of this delay and the fact that they didn't follow their plan? Did they think that it may have contributed to any loss of life? MANN: You know, Pendergrass didn't speak to that directly, except to say he thinks responsibility lies with the residents who chose not to leave their homes. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PENDERGRASS: People get callous of that. We have a lot of people move here in the last five years that's never been through a hurricane, and they just say, oh, it's no big deal. They forget about the force of water. So they didn't leave. I respect their choices. But I'm sure a lot of them regret it now. MANN: But again, for some people who may have wanted to get out, it's possible there just wasn't enough time once that mandatory evacuation order was finally issued. Lee County's own emergency plan warns that it takes at least 20 hours for people on some of those remote islands to evacuate. MART\u00cdNEZ: What has Florida Governor Ron DeSantis said about this? MANN: Well, he's backing local officials. He told reporters that officials in Lee County made the best decision they could with the information available, and he, too, put responsibility on residents. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) RON DESANTIS: Everybody had adequate opportunity to at least get to a shelter within the county. But, you know, a lot of the residents did not want to do that, I think, for - probably for various reasons. Some people just don't want to leave their home, period. They're island people, whatever. MANN: And this is actually something we're hearing from local people in Lee County, survivors of the storm. Many of them told NPR they understood the risk and decided to stay. Here's Louis Schley, who lives in Fort Myers. LOUIS SCHLEY: The governor, he gave fair warning and everything, to evacuate and all. But the wife and I decided, no, we're just going to stay. MANN: But there is a difference, of course, between a warning and a mandatory evacuation order. The question is whether more people would have gotten to safety if the county had issued that order a day sooner. MART\u00cdNEZ: NPR's Brian Mann. Brian, thanks. MANN: Thank you.

MART\u00cdNEZ: NPR's Carrie Kahn in Rio de Janeiro. Carrie, thanks. KAHN: You're welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MART\u00cdNEZ: The Supreme Court begins a new term today. INSKEEP: They resume their work after an unsettled summer that included celebrations of and protests against their rulings. Justices asserted their views in several big cases. Five justices made a choice to eliminate the constitutional right to abortion. The majority upheld gun rights. It also employed a recent concept called the major questions doctrine, which the justices use to limit federal regulation. Now the court resumes its work. MART\u00cdNEZ: Joining us now with a preview of the court's term is NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg. Nina, last term, the court overturned Roe v. Wade, and now it finds its approval rating plummeting to historic lows. How low are those lows? NINA TOTENBERG, BYLINE: Well, the numbers have dropped - more than 60% approval two years ago to below 40% and lower now - so low, in fact, that Chief Justice John Roberts sought to defend the court's legitimacy while speaking to a conference of judges and lawyers in Colorado. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JOHN ROBERTS: The decisions have always been subject to intense criticism. And that is entirely appropriate, but lately, the criticism is phrased in terms of the legitimacy of the court, and I think it's a mistake to view those criticisms in that light. TOTENBERG: It's the job of the court to say what the law is, Roberts said. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ROBERTS: And that role doesn't change simply because people disagree with this opinion or that opinion. You don't want the political branches telling you what the law is, and you don't want public opinion to be the guide of what the appropriate decision is. TOTENBERG: But Justice Elena Kagan has pointedly disagreed with some of what Roberts said, noting in three separate appearances that, in her view, a court's legitimacy has to be earned. She said precedent should be reversed only in the rarest of cases because... (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ELENA KAGAN: If a new judge comes in, if there's new members of a court and, all of a sudden, everything is up for grabs, all of a sudden very fundamental principles of law are being overthrown, then people have a right to say, you know, what's going on there? That doesn't seem very lawlike. MART\u00cdNEZ: All right, with a new court term beginning today, Nina, what are the big cases? TOTENBERG: Well, there are several race cases. Most prominent is a case asking the court to reverse more than four decades of precedent, allowing colleges and universities to consider using race as one of many factors in college admissions. Race is also at the heart of a challenge brought by Alabama to the way the Voting Rights Act has been used in redistricting cases for decades. And race is central to a challenge to the 1978 Indian Child Welfare Act, which requires that, where at all possible, Indian children should be adopted or fostered in Indian homes. MART\u00cdNEZ: And there's a big LGBTQ rights case. Tell us about that one. TOTENBERG: Indeed, there is. It challenges public accommodations laws in most states, laws that bar businesses from discriminating on the basis of race, religion, national origin or sex. So basically, the issue is this - can a business owner refuse to provide certain services to a same-sex couple because it would amount to an endorsement of the couple's lifestyle and, therefore, would violate the business owners' right to freedom of expression? And last but certainly not least, there's another huge case involving election law. It centers on the so-called independent state legislature theory. In its most extreme form, the theory would bar state judges from reviewing state election rules for compliance with state laws and state constitutions.

The Facebook parent company says it has removed a Russian network pushing a pro-Kremlin view of the war in Ukraine and a Chinese network targeting the U.S. midterm elections.\n                \n                    \n                    Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Social media company Meta's headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif. The Facebook parent company says it has removed a Russian network pushing a pro-Kremlin view of the war in Ukraine and a Chinese network targeting the U.S. midterm elections. Facebook parent Meta says it has disrupted a large Russian network of fake accounts impersonating European news outlets to push a pro-Kremlin view of the war in Ukraine. Separately, the social media giant says it also took down a network originating in China targeting the U.S. midterm elections and criticizing the Czech government. While the campaigns were not connected, the dual takedowns underscore how social media platforms continue to be ripe targets for efforts to shape the narratives around high-profile events, said Ben Nimmo, Meta's global threat intelligence lead. \"There's a shooting war going on in Ukraine, there are elections coming up in the U.S.,\" he said. \"And we're seeing influence operations that are talking about those things.\" Meta said the Russian operation was the largest and most complex it has disrupted since President Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine in February. \"You can actually sum up everything it was saying in ten words: 'Ukraine's bad. Russia's good. Stop the sanctions. Stop supplying weapons,'\" Nimmo said. It involved more than 60 websites pretending to be legitimate, high-profile European news organizations, including the U.K.'s The Guardian and Daily Mail, Germany's Der Spiegel and Bild, and Italian news agency ANSA. The spoofed websites were built with care, Nimmo said, under the apparent theory that imitating a big brand would draw a big audience. They copied the layouts of outlets' real sites and imitated their web addresses. In some cases they used bylines and photos of real journalists and included working links to other news articles. But Nimmo said that level of detail is what doomed the operation. Meta began investigating the fake sites after journalists, researchers and members of the public flagged them this summer. \"They overreached themselves,\" he said. \"If you pretend to be Spiegel in Germany in front of an audience where Spiegel is one of the best-known brands in the country, then what you're doing is increasing the risk that somebody is actually going to look at you and say, 'Wait a minute, this is not the real thing.'\" The various fake sites ran articles in multiple languages with pro-Kremlin narratives, including accusing the Ukrainian government and military of corruption and warning of dire consequences from European sanctions on Russia. The bulk of the spoofed news sites were German, but others imitated outlets in the U.K., Italy, France, Ukraine, and Latvia. In earlier phases, the operation created its own brands posing as news outlets, some of which were shared by official Facebook pages of Russian embassies. The network promoted links to its websites using fake accounts on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Telegram and Russia's LiveJournal as well as petition websites including Change.org. Many of the fake accounts used profile pictures generated by artificial intelligence, and a large number claimed to work for Netflix. \"They were trying to do a kind of smash-and-grab raid on the information environment,\" Nimmo said. \"They were trying to create these fakes and push them out so fast and so loudly that they reached real people before they got caught.\" Using fake social media accounts to drive traffic to external websites has become a common tactic in influence operations, also used by a separate Russian influence campaign that Meta removed in the early days of the invasion. Facebook removed more than 2,300 accounts, pages and groups on Facebook and Instagram, which collectively accumulated around 5,500 followers. The network spent about $105,000 on ads promoting links to the fake websites. These amplification tactics were crude, Meta said, with many of the posts, accounts and ads detected by its automated systems. The Chinese network was much smaller and less sophisticated, and gained little, if any, traction. It consisted of 92 accounts, pages and groups on Facebook and Instagram that collectively gained around 280 followers. It's the first time Meta has taken down a China-based effort focusing on the U.S. midterm elections. In the spring and summer of this year, fake accounts posed first as conservative Americans and then as liberals posting about U.S. politics, figures including President Joe Biden, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Florida's Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, and contentious topics such as abortion access and gun rights. Meta said there were similarities to another network of China-based fake accounts it removed in 2020, which posted, in part, about the U.S. presidential election. What is different this time, Nimmo said, is the direct focus on American politics rather than critiquing the U.S. government. \"All the operations from China that we've seen before talk about America rather than talking to America,\" he said. \"It looks like they were using these divisive issues, these hot political issues, as a window into American conversations.\" The network also posted in Chinese about geopolitics, accusing the U.S. of conducting surveillance and cyberattacks against China. In a separate cluster of activity, the fake accounts impersonated Czechs, criticizing the Czech government's support for Ukraine and warning against antagonizing China. The network posted sporadically and typically during Chinese working hours. Its posts got little engagement on Facebook and Instagram, with some other users calling them out as fake, and hashtags it used when posting about American politics were rarely used by accounts outside the network, Meta said. In addition to Facebook and Instagram, the network also operated on Twitter and two Czech petition websites \u2013 a similarity it shared with the Russian campaign. \"That they're moving off social media and trying to find other platforms where they can reach people, whether they're a big operation or a small one \u2013 that's an interesting development,\" Nimmo said. \"They're looking for a safe place on the internet where they're not going to get taken down.\" Editor's note: Meta pays NPR to license NPR content.",

Tim Ryan, Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate in Ohio, greets supporters during a rally on May 2, 2022 in Lorain, Ohio.\n                \n                    \n                    Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption U.S. Rep. Tim Ryan, Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate in Ohio, greets supporters during a rally on May 2, 2022 in Lorain, Ohio. Brittany Koester experienced something of a political evolution recently. She voted for Trump in 2016, but soon soured on him, and started staunchly supporting Democratic candidates. That fervor has grown \u2014 this year, she says, she is more politically active than ever. In large part, the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision overturning Roe v. Wade drove her passion. \"I was like, we got to do something like, what are we going to do?\" she said, of her reaction to the decision. \"So I got involved with certain campaigns or just really in general, and I have been out twice knocking on doors and talking to people.\" Koester is a busy woman \u2013 she spoke to me from her car, on the job as a sales rep for lighting manufacturers. When she is not working, she volunteers with Red Wine and Blue, a group of suburban women supporting Democrats, in particular by engaging family and friends. \u200b\u200b Koester took her training from the trail to her family. She has been talking about reproductive rights at home and believes she has influenced her parents, sister and husband's thinking. In her enthusiasm, she may have also influenced their votes. \"You know, when Tim Ryan came to town, I wanted to meet him in person. I got my mom and my Republican dad to go,\" she said with a laugh. \"My dad hugged Tim Ryan.\" Now, she said, her dad will be voting for Ryan, the Democrat in Ohio's Senate race. Not long ago, Ohio was considered a swing state. These days, it is pretty red; Republicans hold the governorship, the state house and state senate. President Donald Trump won the state in 2020 by 8 points. Despite political trends towards conservative candidates, the U.S. Senate race this year is looking very close as Election Day approaches. The Cook Political Report gives Republican candidate, author and venture capitalist J.D. Vance a slight advantage, rating the race \"Lean Republican.\" Polls also signal it is a tight race. The greatest political outlier right now in Ohio are women voters, many of whom report feeling energized by the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision. Polls show a substantial gender gap in the Ohio Senate race, with women favoring Ryan and men favoring Vance. The latest poll from Emerson College shows Vance with a 19-point advantage among men, and Ryan with an eight-point advantage among women. Tom Bonier, a Democratic strategist and CEO of polling and data firm TargetSmart, has found that in several states, including Ohio, women's voter registration has spiked since the Dobbs decision.\u200b \"Ohio is fascinating because before the Dobbs decision, men were actually out-registering women by a very narrow margin,\" he said. \"Since Dobbs, that's flipped entirely so that now women are out registering men by an 11 point margin. So about a 12-point flip, which puts Ohio among the top states of the biggest gender gaps since the Dobbs decision.\" A New York Times analysis in late August found a similar, if slightly smaller, swing in Ohio. It is not perfectly clear who benefits from that swing toward women's voter registration. In Ohio, voters do not choose a political party when they register to vote. However, Bonier said his modeling shows the surge to be disproportionately Democratic. David Cohen, professor of political science at the University of Akron, explained several reasons this red-state race is close \u2013 for example, Vance is inexperienced and has been out-fundraised by Ryan. But, Cohen added, abortion rights are definitely playing a role. \"There is an energy there that is not normally there in a midterm election for the president's party,\" he said. \"And Dobbs has been a real focusing event for Democrats.\" Vance mostly opposes abortion rights but told NPR that he supports \"reasonable exceptions.\" Ryan, meanwhile, supports abortion rights, telling NPR that he sees codifying Roe as a good policy in terms of what limits should be on the procedure. The economy, though, runs this race. Ryan centered the economy even when other issues came up with voters. On the campaign trail, when I asked him about abortion, he linked it to business concerns. \"We're trying to get our young people to stay here and raise families here, and we're trying to recruit people to come to college and universities here. We're trying to get young people to move here and talent to move here,\" he said. \"To have medieval women's right laws in the country, I think is very detrimental to the economic well-being of the state.\" Katie Paris is founder of Red Wine and Blue \u2013 the group that Brittany Koester volunteers with. As she speaks to women, they have a pragmatic view of Ryan and his focus on the economy over abortion rights.\u200b \"They know what they need to know. People also know that in Ohio to win, you got to do what Sherrod Brown does, and that's do well everywhere,\" she said, invoking Ohio's popular Democratic senator. \"And I think that in that includes doing better than most Democrats have done lately in rural Ohio.\" It is true reproductive rights are not top of mind for all voters, including women. Polling suggests women support abortion rights only modestly more than men \u2014 certainly not overwhelmingly so. Vance referenced that reality when I asked what he might need to do to energize more women. \"Women aren't single issue voters,\" he said. \"I mean, I think women care about a lot of the things that men care about, which is security, inflation, crime, a whole other things on top of it.\" I spoke to Vance at the Morgan County Fair in southeastern Ohio. That's also where I met Leinala Porter, a 19-year-old waitress at a nearby Bob Evans restaurant.\u200b She did not have a lot to say about the upcoming election \u2014 I asked if she had heard much about JD Vance or Tim Ryan \u2014 \"\u200bNope,\" she said, with a laugh. She plans to vote, but has not registered yet. One topic where she did have a lot to say: abortion. \"I'm pro choice in a large way,\" she said. \"It just doesn't seem very fair to make a woman pay for and have a child when she just isn't ready, or if it can potentially kill her.\" It is voters like Porter that could put Ryan over the top \u2013 new voters who might not be paying a lot of attention, but who do care about reproductive rights.",

            "article_content": "An Arizona judge is expected to decide soon whether the state can enforce a 19th century law banning almost all abortions, or if a 2022 law banning abortions after 15 weeks should take effect.  LEILA FADEL, HOST: Abortion access is about to become more restricted in Arizona. This week, a judge is expected to decide between two laws - an old abortion ban could be reinstated or a less-restrictive law passed this year could be enacted. Katherine Davis-Young from member station KJZZ in Phoenix reports. KATHERINE DAVIS-YOUNG, BYLINE: There were no patients around when I visited Dr. DeShawn Taylor's Phoenix family-planning clinic on a recent Monday. Back when the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June, Taylor stopped all abortion services. She's since resumed medication abortions, but she hasn't been able to bring back enough staff to take on patients who need surgical abortions. DESHAWN TAYLOR: To know that those people are going without care is particular distressing to me. Those are the people who absolutely are having to leave the state. DAVIS-YOUNG: There are nine abortion clinics in Arizona. Many, like Taylor's, have paused or limited services over the last 2 1/2 months. That's because it hasn't been totally clear what's legal in Arizona after Roe. TAYLOR: Our leaders are supposed to tell us what laws are in effect and how we are to comply, and that didn't happen. DAVIS-YOUNG: Republican Attorney General Mark Brnovich says with Roe overturned, Arizona's oldest abortion law should now go into effect. It's a near-total ban that dates back to the 1860s, before Arizona was even a state. But in the century and a half since then, Arizona has made dozens of other laws related to abortion. Just this year, the Legislature voted to outlaw the procedure after 15 weeks gestation. SARAH MAC DOUGALL: The Arizona Legislature could have had the territorial ban go back into effect if Dobbs were to overturn Roe, but they didn't. DAVIS-YOUNG: Sarah Mac Dougall, an attorney for Planned Parenthood, says those more recent laws suggest elected officials intended to allow abortions in Arizona, at least in some circumstances. MAC DOUGALL: The AG is essentially seeking an undemocratic way to re-implement a total ban on abortion when that is not what the Arizona Legislature has said most recently. DAVIS-YOUNG: The attorney general's office declined to provide an interview for this story. But in court, Attorney Beau Roysden, with the office, argued abortion laws Arizona passed after Roe were only written the way they were because that ruling was still in place. BEAU ROYSDEN: Those laws were passed by the Legislature because the Supreme Court said you are required to recognize a constitutional right to abortion. DAVIS-YOUNG: He argued the new 15-week law doesn't overturn the old ban. Superior Court Judge Kellie Johnson is expected to give her opinion this week. Abortion will be further restricted whatever she decides. If she sides with the attorney general, Arizona would go back to its near-total ban. If she sides with Planned Parenthood, the new 15-week law would take effect Saturday. But Johnson probably won't have the final say. Either side would be likely to appeal, so the case could eventually end up before the mostly conservative Arizona Supreme Court. So for Arizona abortion providers like DeShawn Taylor, the future is still uncertain. TAYLOR: This moment is going to have repercussions for generations to come. DAVIS-YOUNG: Taylor says the court case is only one concern for her. She's also thinking about what might happen in November's election or in the legislative session that begins in January, where lawmakers will no longer be bound by Roe. TAYLOR: I'm quite sure that if we have the current people running the state continue to run the state, it is their intention that abortion is completely illegal in this state. DAVIS-YOUNG: For now, she says she just won't book new appointments until after the judge rules. For NPR News, I'm Katherine Davis-Young in Phoenix.

This fall, Michigan voters will weigh in on an expansive ballot question that would change the voting process.\n                \n                    \n                    John Moore/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Election workers sort absentee ballots at the Lansing city clerk's office on Nov. 3, 2020, in Lansing, Mich. This fall, Michigan voters will weigh in on an expansive ballot question that would change the voting process. This fall, Michigan and Nevada feature competitive, top-of-the-ticket elections for offices like governor. But that's not all. Voters in the swing states could also make significant changes to how their elections are administered. Michigan and Nevada are among the states where voters this year are set to decide ballot measures relating to the elections process. Here's a rundown. Michigan was officially added to the list last week, after the state's high court ordered the Board of State Canvassers \u2014 which had previously deadlocked along partisan lines \u2014 to certify a citizen-led amendment on voting. (The court ruled the same way for a closely watched measure on abortion rights.) The \"Promote the Vote\" proposal would make a series of changes to the Michigan Constitution, including expanding access to early voting, absentee ballots and ballot drop boxes, and allowing voters to sign an affidavit to attest to their identity when they don't have a photo ID. The amendment push comes after Michigan Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer vetoed several Republican-led voting measures over the last year. And it's as a separate proposal, \"Secure MI Vote\" \u2014 which has GOP support, and would tighten rules around voting \u2014 has been organized as well, though it won't be on the 2022 ballot. If \"Promote the Vote\" passes this fall, it could preempt many of the changes backers of \"Secure MI Vote\" may seek to make in the future. Voters cast their ballots at Reno High School for Nevada's statewide primaries on June 14.\n                \n                    \n                    Trevor Bexon/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption In Nevada, another citizen-led amendment would establish open primaries, in which all candidates are on one ballot and the top five advance. Ranked-choice voting would then be used for general elections until the winner gets majority support. The system would be for state and federal elections, but not for presidential contests. Notably, the Las Vegas Review-Journal adds this unique Nevada detail: Since the proposal \"would amend the state constitution, voters would need to approve in 2022 and again in 2024 for it to take effect, starting with the 2026 election cycle.\" The changes in Nevada, if approved, would be similar to the new system in Alaska that helped Democrat Mary Peltola top two Republicans to win a special congressional election two weeks ago. Nevada's top Democrats, including its governor and two U.S. senators, however, oppose the switch to open primaries and ranked-choice voting. Another key swing state, Arizona, has a proposal on this fall's ballot that would add identification requirements to the voting process. And it looked as though voters could weigh in on a far more sweeping voting measure, too, if it not for controversial court rulings that kept it off the ballot. Late last month the Arizona Supreme Court upheld a decision that the Arizona Republic described as a \"stunning reversal by a lower-court judge who ultimately concluded the Arizona Free and Fair Elections Act fell 1,458 short of the needed 237,645 valid voter signatures to qualify for the Nov. 8 ballot.\" Backers of the proposal \u2014 which would have enacted a slew of changes to expand voting access, including same-day voter registration \u2014 blasted the ruling by the high court justices, who were all appointed by Republican governors. \"Voters turned in 475,000 signatures \u2014 double the 237,645 requirement. But, Governor [Doug] Ducey's expanded and stacked Supreme Court found a way to invalidate over 50% of the signatures,\" Stacy Pearson, spokesperson for the ballot measure, said in a statement to the Arizona Mirror. Opponents of the proposal said it would have ushered in \"radical\" reforms, and challenged tens of thousands of petition signatures, in part due to issues with signature-gatherers' paperwork. - Connecticut: Voters will decide whether to amend the state constitution to allow lawmakers to pass a bill for in-person early voting. Connecticut is one of just four states that don't have early in-person voting available for all voters. - Nebraska: As in Arizona, Nebraskans will also vote on a photo ID proposal. - Louisiana, Ohio: Both states have measures that would prohibit non-U.S. citizens from voting in any local elections. The proposals follow efforts in some municipalities nationwide to open up local elections to noncitizens.",

            "article_content": "In one of the final primary elections of 2022, New Hampshire voters chose Don Bolduc to face off with Democratic incumbents for Congress. He won by a razor thin margin.  JUANA SUMMERS, HOST: Republicans in New Hampshire have made their choices in three key primaries, choosing candidates Don Bolduc, Karoline Leavitt and Robert Burns, who all worked to align themselves with former President Donald Trump. New Hampshire Public Radio's Josh Rogers reports. JOSH ROGERS, BYLINE: As Don Bolduc celebrated his razor-thin win in New Hampshire's Republican U.S. Senate primary early this morning, he smiled and held aloft a circular shield pierced by three arrows. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DON BOLDUC: We have taken their arrows. We have successfully protected ourselves. ROGERS: The retired Army general, who served 10 tours of duty in Afghanistan, has been fighting to get to the Senate for some time. Bolduc first ran in 2020, lost in the primary and never stopped running. That head start, and New Hampshire Governor Chris Sununu's decision to opt out of the race, gave Bolduc an opening. And he took it, doggedly courting conservatives statewide. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BOLDUC: And that's what resonates with everybody because they're tired of lack of representation that they're getting in career politicians serving themselves and not serving the people. ROGERS: Bolduc edged New Hampshire State Senate President Chuck Morse in the five-way primary, in which Democrats spent to boost Bolduc's chances in the race. Bolduc represents a trend that emerged across the state Tuesday night. Populism of a Trumpian flavor carried the day on the Republican ticket. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KAROLINE LEAVITT: As your congresswoman, I will fight to pass term limits and drain the swamp. (APPLAUSE) ROGERS: Twenty-five-year-old Karoline Leavitt, a former Trump administration press aide, ran up a convincing win over a crowded field in New Hampshire's first district race for a true swing seat. Like Bolduc, Leavitt positioned herself as the anti-establishment Republican. The former White House and congressional staffer echoed the former president's lies about the 2020 election. She hopes campaigning on term limits in Congress and other Trumpian talking points will send her to Washington. Meanwhile, in the race for New Hampshire's other district, it was Robert Burns, a serial candidate, who went all-in embracing Trumpism at every campaign stop and in every ad. (SOUNDBITE OF POLITICAL AD, \"BURNS - THE ONLY PRO-TRUMP, PRO-LIFE CONSERVATIVE RUNNING\") UNIDENTIFIED NARRATOR: Robert Burns is the only pro-Trump, pro-life candidate running in New Hampshire's second congressional district. ROGERS: Whether there's an upshot of Republicans nominating such hard-right candidates in purple-state New Hampshire is far from clear. But how the Democrats intend to take them on? Well, that's readily apparent. The three incumbents - Senator Maggie Hassan and Representatives Chris Pappas and Annie Kuster - all cast doubt on their GOP rivals' electability. Abortion rights and the specter of a national abortion ban was a throughline for Maggie Hassan, the candidate in the state's biggest race. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MAGGIE HASSAN: In the world's greatest democracy, Don Bolduc will make women second-class citizens. This is what's at stake. ROGERS: Republicans, meanwhile, say economic issues, like inflation and energy costs, are what's most at stake for voters, and they expect those to drive outcomes in November here.

Friday, the Michigan Board of State Canvassers, acting under an order from the Michigan Supreme Court, put a question before voters this November on whether to protect abortion rights in the state constitution. Last week, the question was sent to the state Supreme Court after Republican canvassers argued the amendment's spacing and formatting would confuse voters. The group behind the amendment, Reproductive Freedom for All, appealed the decision to the state's highest court. Thursday, the court decided to move it along. \"Ultimately, the system works. It may be put under great stress at times, but it works,\" said Republican Michigan Board of State Canvassers Tony Daunt, who followed through on a promise to vote to certify if that's what the Michigan Supreme Court ordered. Daunt took issue with criticism leveled against the two GOP members for voting not to move the amendment forward. He said the issue of the petition forms had never been addressed before and the court decision set a precedent that future boards would now have to follow. \"It is really important for us to recognize that this is a victory for the people of Michigan who signed in such record numbers,\" said Democratic board member Mary Ellen Gurewitz. Petitioners collected about 750,000 signatures, far more than the 425,000 signatures required. It's been a contentious week for abortion in Michigan \u2014 one of the only states in the region where abortion remains legal. Wednesday, a judge ordered to bar enforcement of a 1931 law that criminalizes the procedure. Michigan joins other states such as California and Vermont where voters will see similar state constitutional abortion rights amendments on their ballots this November.",

A judge strikes down Michigan's strict anti-abortion law.  RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: Families are being separated at a border. This time it's Russians who are forcibly moving Ukrainians into Russian territory, then taking their children away from parents. A MART\u00cdNEZ, HOST: The U.S. says what Russia is doing to Ukrainians is a war crime. U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Linda Thomas-Greenfield called a Security Council meeting yesterday on the so-called filtration centers where Ukrainians are being held. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LINDA THOMAS-GREENFIELD: Filtered - the word does not begin to convey the horror and the depravity of these premeditated policies. MARTIN: NPR's diplomatic correspondent Michele Kelemen is with us this morning. Hey, Michele. MICHELE KELEMEN, BYLINE: Good morning, Rachel. MARTIN: Does the U.S. have evidence of these so-called filtration camps and this family separation? KELEMEN: So there's been a lot of reporting from human rights groups and from the U.S. intelligence community about this Russian practice. Russia had filtration camps in the war in Chechnya, too, by the way. So yesterday, Thomas-Greenfield cited some examples of stories that the U.S. has been hearing. And she said there's new evidence that officials in Vladimir Putin's administration are overseeing this campaign to deport or disappear Ukrainians who oppose what Russia is doing in areas that it now is occupying in Ukraine. And she said this is all laying the groundwork for Russia to annex parts of Ukraine. Take a listen to how she summed up her presentation in the Security Council. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) THOMAS-GREENFIELD: Colleagues, there will come a day when we are gathered in this council to condemn Russia's - the Russian Federation's attempts to annex more of Ukraine's territory. And I will ask that you remember what you've heard here today. No one - no one - will be able to say they were not warned. KELEMEN: And Rachel, that's what the U.S. has been doing throughout this conflict, declassifying information to show what the Russians are up to. It warned the world that Russia was going to invade earlier this year, and that's what the Russians did. MARTIN: What does Russia have to say about this, their ambassador to the U.N.? KELEMEN: Deny and deflect - that's basically the strategy of Ambassador Vasily Nebenzya. He said yesterday's meeting might be a new milestone in a disinformation campaign. Those were his words. He says Ukrainians who go to Russia go through a registration process, not a filtration procedure. And he blasted the U.S. and others for supplying weapons to Ukraine. You know, Russia all along has been trying to portray this as a Western proxy war against Russia. A top U.N. official gave diplomats a reality check on that. She ended her presentation with a pretty stark quote. All wars are tragic, Rosemary DiCarlo said, but none more so than a war of choice. MARTIN: So it's true. I mean, throughout the conflict, the U.S. has tried to strengthen Ukraine's hand with a whole lot of weapons shipments and aid. But there has, Michele, been baked in this assumption that this war was going to have to end in a diplomatic agreement of some kind. How likely is that looking right now? KELEMEN: I mean, so far, U.S. officials just don't think Russia is serious about diplomacy, and they say that Ukraine has to decide how this war ends. The U.N. secretary general managed to help negotiate a deal to get Ukrainian grain shipments out, but Russia is now raising doubts about that. And then there's another thing that the U.N. is trying to arrange, and that's a demilitarized zone around a nuclear power plant. MARTIN: Right. KELEMEN: But that's something that doesn't seem to be happening anytime soon. MARTIN: NPR's diplomatic correspondent Michele Kelemen - Michele, thank you. KELEMEN: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MARTIN: The search for the remaining suspect in a series of knife attacks in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan is over now. MART\u00cdNEZ: Myles Sanderson was arrested by Royal Canadian Mounted Police Wednesday and died shortly afterwards in police custody. Here's RCMP Assistant Commissioner Rhonda Blackmore. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) RHONDA BLACKMORE: This is not the end of our work. We do not stop here. The Saskatchewan RCMP continues to investigate this tragedy, and a police presence will continue in James Smith Cree Nation and the Weldon communities for the next while. MARTIN: Joining us now, CBC News reporter Yasmine Ghania in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. Thank you so much for being with us. YASMINE GHANIA: You're welcome. MARTIN: Tell us how police eventually caught up with the second suspect. GHANIA: So, Rachel, police searched for Myles Sanderson for 3 1/2 days, and for a long time, officers didn't know his whereabouts at all. You know, there were possible sightings of him in multiple areas in the province that came up empty, and police were even looking for him in two other provinces. But he was found near a small town yesterday afternoon after he broke into a woman's house and stole her truck. So police were called to that area and found him along the highway. He was in police custody, but shortly after, he went into medical distress and was pronounced dead in hospital. We don't know exactly what the cause of death is. We know he was injured before the arrest, but sources also tell us he could have died by possible overdose. So that's still unclear. MARTIN: And just to remind listeners, the first suspect was also found dead, and they're brothers, right? GHANIA: That's right. He was found dead on Monday. And there are still many unanswered questions about that as well - his involvement in the attacks and what happened there. But he was found dead Monday, and they are brothers. MARTIN: What more has come out about his background, this second suspect - anything? GHANIA: Yes, we know Sanderson had a history of violence and a lengthy criminal record. He racked up 59 convictions. We also know from court records that he actually tried to kill one of the mass stabbing victims before, seven years ago. And that was his father-in-law. And he's tried stabbing other men on the reserve, too, we've learned through court records. And he also has a long history of intimate partner violence charges. But despite all that, he was out on statutory release. Then he stopped meeting with his caseworker this summer and disappeared for months. MARTIN: And these stabbings originated on an Indigenous reservation. Ten people died. I mean, how is the community responding at this point? GHANIA: You know, Rachel, the community is feeling so many different emotions now that the search is over. The biggest emotion is relief, but also anguish, sorrow, grief and anger. And we don't yet know the motive for the attacks. I think that's something that can really get in the way of people healing from this tragedy. But the community will be grappling with the immense loss and trauma for many, many years. MARTIN: Yeah. CBC News reporter Yasmine Ghania, thank you so much. We appreciate it. GHANIA: You're welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MARTIN: Abortion rights supporters in the state of Michigan have scored a big victory. MART\u00cdNEZ: That's right. First, some background, though - there has been a law on the books in Michigan since 1931 that banned abortions in most cases and called for prosecutors to charge abortion providers with felonies. This law hasn't been enforced, but after the Supreme Court's decision overturning Roe v. Wade, some lawmakers wanted to revive it. Now a judge says that's not going to happen. MARTIN: Michigan Public Radio's Rick Pluta has been following all this and joins us this morning. Hey, Rick. RICK PLUTA, BYLINE: Hello. MARTIN: Explain the judge's decision here. PLUTA: Sure. Judge Gleicher issued a temporary ruling before the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in June in the Dobbs case that overturned Roe v. Wade. It was back in April that Judge Gleicher said the Michigan Constitution probably protects reproductive rights. Now she's saying she's confident that was the right call, and she made that a permanent injunction. MARTIN: So she's saying this 1931 ban can't go back into effect, which is good news for abortion providers who could have ended up facing felony charges, right? PLUTA: Exactly. This shields them from charges, at least for now. And that is good news for Dr. Sarah Wallett, who is the chief medical officer for Planned Parenthood of Michigan. SARAH WALLETT: Right now, we can be reassured that abortion access in Michigan is here, that I can keep providing health care to patients, that people in Michigan can keep coming to their appointments. And I don't have to worry about criminal prosecution for providing the health care to my patients that they need. MARTIN: What's been the reaction, Rick, from those on the other side of this issue, those who were pushing to reinstate the ban? PLUTA: A group of Republican prosecutors have filed this lawsuit. They're not happy and defiant in the ruling. Judge Gleicher says the state attorney general who supports abortion rights should instruct county prosecutors, well, not to prosecute. And that doesn't sit well with those prosecutors, who have filed their own lawsuit. Their attorney, David Kallman, says filing charges against abortion providers is their call, and yesterday's court decision, in his opinion, does not affect what they can do. DAVID KALLMAN: I didn't realize the state of Michigan now, according to Judge Gleicher, controls and runs all 83 county prosecutor's offices in the state. Wow. This is pretty novel, pretty groundbreaking, you know, news. I mean, since when did this happen? MARTIN: So just to be clear, Rick, they're saying the judge's decision actually doesn't shut the door on the 1931 ban, and individual prosecutors can still apply it. PLUTA: Exactly. MARTIN: So, you know, there are going to be legal battles over this, but there's also this effort to get a measure on the November ballot that would protect abortion rights in the Constitution, right? What's the status of that? PLUTA: Well, it's in limbo. Activists who support abortion rights ran this petition campaign. They collected a record 750,000 signatures to put that question on the November ballot. But opponents have filed a court challenge, and that challenge claims the language in the proposed amendment is too baffling to qualify for the ballot. MARTIN: OK. So we're going to see what happens there. I mean, that's gone to the Michigan Supreme Court, though, right? I mean, what's the deadline for a decision on that? PLUTA: Soon. Very soon. We're looking at today, tomorrow, no later than Monday, because election officials say that's the deadline to finalize the ballot. MARTIN: All right. Rick Pluta is senior Capitol correspondent for Michigan Public Radio Network. Thank you so much for your reporting, Rick. We appreciate it. PLUTA: You bet. Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.

Washington, D.C. \u2013 Molly Smith felt she had no choice: she had to birth a theater piece. \"When Roe v. Wade was struck down I was devastated, along with just about everyone I know,\" says Smith, longtime artistic director at Arena Stage. \"So I contacted eight wonderful female writers and asked them each to write a monologue around choice.\" The result is an evening called My Body No Choice, opening October 20th. In a nod to the voting age of 18, it will have an 18-performance run with tickets priced at $18, concluding the Sunday before November's midterm election. Because a woman's right to choose is central to the evening, it made sense not to restrict the choices made by the playwrights, Smith tells NPR. \"Many are writing about choice around reproductive freedom. But some are writing about choice in terms of the right to die; choice in terms of the right to be the body size that you want to be.\" Hawaiian-born playwright Lee Cataluna, for instance, writes in her monologue, \"Things My Mother Told Me,\" of how her mother worked within her societally-constricted choices to make strong decisions in child rearing, in life-lessons, in finding joy in the birth of six kittens after a doctor made her have her tubes tied. And then, after a lifetime of following orders, she chose to stop chemotherapy, even in the face of her daughter's opposition. \"You're giving up and choosing death,\" Cataluna protests in the monologue, before noting the irony. \"It was the only real choice she ever got to make over her own body, and I was furious with her over making that choice.\" Smith suggests that these sorts of stories can prompt shifts in perception. \"I looked at gay rights and when that quantum change [in acceptance] happened around the country. And I believe it's when gay people began telling family, friends, neighbors about who they were \u2014 the whole of who they were and their sexuality. There was a national shift. \"I think what's happened with abortion and reproduction is that for many, many years women have been silent. And I think now is really a time for women to speak out.\" To facilitate the speaking out, Arena is inviting women, trans, and non-binary individuals to share their stories about choices and their bodies in short videos to be showcased on the theater's digital media properties, \"extending the experience after the lights have gone down.\" As the final production Smith will direct before ending her 25-year tenure at the waterfront D.C. arts complex she helped build, My Body No Choice fits her vision of a purpose-driven stage and its place in society. \"Theater is the closest art form to who we are as human beings,\" she says. \"There's something that happens in the theater that changes people, and shifts maybe not who they are, but shifts their thinking.\" Besides Cataluna, a Who's Who of women playwrights are contributors: Pulitzer Prize-finalists Dael Orlandersmith (Yellowman), and Sarah Ruhl (In the Next Room or the vibrator play), as well as playwright and screenwriter Lisa Loomer (Roe, The Waiting Room), and V (formerly Eve Ensler) a Tony and Obie-winning activist and author of the worldwide phenomenon The Vagina Monologues. Also performer/poet Fatima Dyfan; playwright/director/producer Mary Hall Surface; and a D.C. artist who's chosen to remain anonymous \"to highlight how personal and private our choices are.\"",

Wade. ANN ARBOR, Mich. \u2014 Enforcement of Michigan's 1931 abortion ban was blocked Wednesday by a judge who replaced her temporary order with a permanent injunction. Michigan Court of Claims Judge Elizabeth Gleicher ruled the Michigan Constitution's due process clause is expansive enough to cover reproductive rights. \"The Michigan Constitution protects the right of all pregnant people to make autonomous health decisions,\" she wrote, and later: \"Exercising the right to bodily integrity means exercising the right to determine when in her life a woman will be best prepared physically, emotionally and financially to be a mother.\" Gleicher's initial temporary order pre-dated the U.S. Supreme Court's Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization ruling in June. Dr. Sarah Wallett, the chief medical officer for Planned Parenthood of Michigan, says this means abortion rights are protected while there's still a lot of litigation pending. \"But this does help reassure providers and patients who are really worried that that might not always be the case in Michigan,\" she told the Michigan Public Radio Network. Michigan's dormant abortion law would threaten abortion providers with felony charges. Gleicher's opinion was somewhat technical. It did not directly bar prosecutors from filing charges against abortion providers. Instead, she instructed Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel to inform prosecutors that abortion rights remain protected. Nessel has already said she won't file charges under the 1931 law. The distinction is meaningless, according to attorney David Kallman, who represents county prosecutors who say they are allowed to file criminal charges under the 1931 law. \"Unbelievable,\" he said. \"Talk about a shift and a change in our constitutional form of government. I didn't realize the state of Michigan now, according to Judge Gleicher, controls and runs all 83 county prosecutors' offices in this state.\" This is one of several abortion-related legal cases in play in Michigan. It could join at least three decisions that have been appealed to the Michigan Supreme Court. There's also a separate case that seeks to put an abortion rights amendment on the November ballot. The court is expected to rule this week on a challenge to the petition campaign, which gathered nearly 750,000 signatures \u2014 a record \u2014 in an effort to put a proposed reproductive rights amendment on the November ballot.",

            "article_content": "It's a busy time in Pennsylvania, with appearances from President Biden and former President Trump, underscoring the state's importance in the upcoming midterm elections.  SCOTT SIMON, HOST: Campaign planes have practically lined up in Pennsylvania this week. President Biden was in Philadelphia Thursday night. He gave a primetime address denouncing MAGA Republicans as a danger to democracy. He also visited Wilkes-Barre earlier in the week. He'll be in Pittsburgh on Labor Day while Donald Trump is in Wilkes-Barre tonight, hosting a rally for candidates that he's endorsed. I'm going to turn now to Katie Meyer, political reporter of WHYY in Philadelphia. Katie, thanks for being with us. KATIE MEYER, BYLINE: Thanks for having me. SIMON: Well, so glad you're there at ground zero. Why all of this Pennsylvania travel for both Biden and Trump? MEYER: Well, you know, this is a state with two very big open races. So Pat Toomey, U.S. senator from Pennsylvania, is stepping down, so his seat's wide open. We've got Democrat John Fetterman, who's lieutenant governor right now, and Mehmet Oz, the celebrity TV doctor you may have heard of. And then, over for the governor's race, we've got Josh Shapiro, who's the attorney general with a long history in state politics, and Doug Mastriano, who is a state senator with some pretty fringe opinions, I would say. SIMON: In your reporting, do you find that Pennsylvanians seem to be most concerned about a couple of issues? MEYER: Yeah. And some of them are being seen across the country in lots of races, things like the economy, prices. Crime's a big one. In the Senate race, especially, Oz has tried to criticize Fetterman for having two formerly incarcerated men on his campaign. Fetterman, as lieutenant governor, has really pushed hard for pardons for people who have questionable convictions or nonviolent convictions that have kept them in prison for a long time. But I would say one of the big overarching themes, especially in the race for governor, has been, you know, Republicans' commitment, I would say, to these debunked theories that there was widespread fraud in the 2020 election. And Doug Mastriano, the GOP nominee for that race, he was at the Jan. 6th insurrection in Washington, D.C. He has been pretty firm in his belief in some sort of widespread election fraud, and he has some really fringe figures involved in his campaign. So Josh Shapiro, his Democratic opponent, has really, really stressed that on the campaign trail. SIMON: Has abortion become a more urgent issue following the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade? MEYER: It has. Pennsylvania's one of those states where it doesn't have a trigger law that would make abortion immediately illegal, but it does have a Republican-controlled legislature that's proven itself to be very willing to restrict abortion. So it's been a really vital issue. Doug Mastriano supports a total ban on abortion under all circumstances, and it's been a vital issue especially in the Philadelphia suburbs. These are really politically powerful, populous areas with some swing voters. And some voters, even Trump supporting voters I talked to like Stacey Naulty - she voted for Trump in 2016 and 2020. But she says she thinks Mastriano just might be too conservative, and abortion's a big reason why. STACEY NAULTY: He will take it to the extreme and completely shut abortion down altogether. And that's not an answer. People, you know, rape little children, and you're going to have her, you know, have a baby, you know, out of that situation? No. It's not OK. MEYER: Now, Mastriano has tried to shift a little bit on abortion, saying it's really up to the legislature, but he hasn't totally walked back those claims. He's just de-emphasized them. SIMON: Katie, the president will be in Pennsylvania three times in a week. Does that indicate that Democrats see rising prospects there? MEYER: It does, I think. If we look at big political trends, this looks like a bad year for Democrats. It's usually tough for any party who has the presidency in the first midterm after that president is elected. And in Pennsylvania, especially in the governor's race, we're coming off of eight years of a Democratic governor. And historically, we then flip to the other party for the governorship. This has happened since the '60s. So this would be an aberration if Josh Shapiro, the Democrat, wins. I'll say, though - I mean, candidates matter. And these two candidates, Dr. Oz and Doug Mastriano, are seen as tough ones, not the most regular, appealing types of Republican candidates in Pennsylvania. So it's a wild card, this race. SIMON: Katie Meyer of WHYY in Philadelphia, thanks so much. MEYER: Thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.  All rights reserved.

LANSING, Mich. \u2013 A proposed state constitutional amendment that could protect abortion rights in Michigan has hit another roadblock on its path to November's ballot. Wednesday, a four-person board deadlocked along partisan lines on whether to send the amendment along to voters this fall. Abortion rights supporters are expected to appeal the decision straight to the state's supreme court, but time is ticking. Any language that is slated to appear on the ballot would have to be sent to the printer by Sept. 9. \"Certainly that will be the next step, asking the Supreme Court to have the board do its job, essentially, and put this on the ballot because we have complied with the requirements,\" says Darci McConnell of the group Reproductive Freedom for All. McConnell says the campaign turned in far more signatures than are required to get on the ballot. In fact, the petition broke a record in the state when more than 700,000 voters signed on. For Michiganders who support abortion rights, the possibility of an amendment to protect abortion is important. The state has a nearly 100-year-old law that makes abortion illegal except in cases where the pregnant person's life is at risk. For now, that law is held up in litigation and is not being enforced. But Republicans said the petitions that were circulated had typos and words that were pushed too close together to be easily understood. The proposed amendment has faced scrutiny over alleged typos in its petition language for weeks. \"Call these typos, errors, mistakes, or whatever,\" says Eric Doster, the attorney for Citizens to Support MI Women and Children. \"This gibberish now before this board does not satisfy the full test requirement under law and this board has never approved, never approved a petition with these types of typos and errors.\" The version of the petition available online at the Board of State Canvassers' website appears to show the typos, such as: \"DECISIONSABOUTALLMATTERSRELATINGTOPREGNANCY.\" Richard Houskamp, left, Anthony Daunt and Mary Ellen Gurewitz, members of the Michigan state Board of Canvassers, listen to a speaker during a hearing.\n                \n                    \n                    Carlos Osorio/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Richard Houskamp, left, Anthony Daunt and Mary Ellen Gurewitz, members of the Michigan state Board of Canvassers, listen to a speaker during a hearing. Reproductive Freedom for All, the group behind the proposed amendment, can appeal the Wednesday decision straight to the Michigan Supreme Court where Democrats have a narrow majority. If approved by the justices, Michigan will join other states such as California and Vermont where voters will see similar state constitutional abortion rights amendments on their ballots this November. After voters in Kansas decided to reject a constitutional amendment that would have restricted abortion rights, Democrats across the country have renewed enthusiasm to push for abortion rights. Democrats, including Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, are pushing hard for an amendment in part because of how much is at stake in November. Whitmer is running for reelection against abortion rights opponent Republican Tudor Dixon, who is endorsed by former President Donald Trump. Dixon made headlines this summer after responding to a question about the hypothetical rape of a 14-year-old by a family member being a \"perfect example\" of why abortion should be banned. An amendment to protect abortion rights could propel abortion rights supporters to the polls and help push Democrats to victory up and down the ballot.",

Wade has reshaped the political landscape. And that's especially true in Kansas, where an anti-abortion ballot measure lost in a landslide earlier this month. As Frank Morris of member station KCUR reports, an embattled Democratic congresswoman running for reelection is taking the abortion fight to her Republican challenger. FRANK MORRIS, BYLINE: There's only one Democrat in the Kansas congressional delegation - Representative Sharice Davids. And with redistricting this year, her seat get a lot tougher to defend. NANCY PENCE: And it'll show you a little map. MORRIS: But Davids has lots of help from people like Nancy Pence here, training volunteers to campaign door-to-door in a post-Roe world. PENCE: We're in uncharted ground now. And I think that astute politicians look at this and say, this is something I should pay attention to. MORRIS: It'd be hard to miss the political upheaval in Kansas. Earlier this month, voters in this conservative state crushed a proposed state constitutional amendment that would have paved the way for a ban on abortion. It was a massive upset, touching off tearful celebrations among activists accustomed to losing elections. (APPLAUSE) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Woo (ph). MORRIS: The amendment failed 59 to 41% in the best-attended primary election in state history. A partial recount only confirmed the outcome. SHARICE DAVIDS: When 50 years of precedent protecting our rights was overturned and removed, people got scared. They got anxious. Lives were upended, and people got angry. MORRIS: Sharice Davids has hitched her campaign to that anger, staging press conferences and producing ads reminding voters that her opponent, former Kansas Republican Party Chairwoman Amanda Adkins, was on the losing side of the abortion amendment vote. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Our friends and neighbors rejected her extremist politics. Now we can stop Amanda Adkins from bringing her anti-choice agenda to Congress. MORRIS: Adkins' campaign didn't respond to calls and emails requesting an interview for this story. Adkins has been hammering Davids on inflation and support for Joe Biden. Here's part of her new radio ad. SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: Radical Biden and Davids policies are devastating American families and businesses. Instead of fighting for us, Sharice Davids blindly votes with Joe Biden. MORRIS: Adkins says that she believes that life begins at conception. But it's not something she's advertising. So this is a major reversal - a Kansas Democrat going after a Kansas Republican on the issue of abortion. STEPHANIE SHARP: Always an issue for the right - always, always, always. MORRIS: But Stephanie Sharp, a political consultant and former Republican Kansas lawmaker, says the abortion ballot issue uncovered a disconnect. It turns out the Kansas electorate has more nuanced views on abortion than most successful Republican lawmakers here do. And Trump says the massive primary turnout exposed a potential voting bloc for a candidate like Davids trying to activate middle-of-the-road voters. SHARP: There's a segment of the population that never, ever votes in primaries. So you take the Democrats and unaffiliateds that voted in this primary. Then you take Republicans who voted in this primary but have never voted in a primary before. Those are your moderates. You know, that's your margin of victory, easily. MORRIS: And this isn't just about Kansas. Polls show that most Americans say they disapprove of the Supreme Court decision overthrowing Roe. And other vulnerable Democratic congresswomen in Iowa, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Virginia are leaning into the abortion rights issue this year. With surging inflation, mass shootings and climate disasters, it's not clear how much difference one issue might make. But candidates like Sharice Davids are hoping that a new emphasis on abortion rights will help get their voters to the polls come November. For NPR News, I'm Frank Morris in Kansas City.

Crist, a member of congress, will face Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis in November. TALLAHASSEE, Fla. \u2014 Democrat and longtime politician Charlie Crist has won the primary for governor in Florida and will face Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis in November, according to a race call by The Associated Press. Crist served as Florida's Republican governor more than a decade ago and is now a Democrat in the U.S. House of Representatives. The primary for governor has highlighted a split within the Democratic Party in the state. Crist's challenger, Florida Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried, hammered him over his record as governor and for switching his stance on issues like abortion and criminal justice. As Crist claimed victory Tuesday night, he thanked Fried for a spirited campaign, but it was clear his sights were firmly set on DeSantis: \"The stakes could not be any higher for this election. Our fundamental freedoms are literally on the ballot, my friends. A woman's right to choose - on the ballot. Democracy - on the ballot. Your rights as minorities are on this ballot.\" He called DeSantis a \"bully\" and \"dangerous\" and made sure to solidify his stance as a candidate who supports abortion rights. \"On day one of my administration, I will sign an executive order protecting a women's right to choose.\" Crist outraised Fried and has run as a moderate by casting himself as the person most likely to beat DeSantis in November. He has tried to court unaffiliated voters and disaffected Republicans and has earned endorsements from top Democratic-leaning groups like the state's teachers' union. When it comes to winning elections, Crist has a mixed record. He left the Republican party in 2010 to run as an independent against Marco Rubio for the U.S. Senate. He made another run for governor as a Democrat in 2014 but lost by about a percentage point to Republican Rick Scott \u2014 now a U.S. senator. Now that the dust has settled on the Democratic primary, Crist will face DeSantis in November. The powerful governor is rumored to be considering a presidential run in 2024. He's raised his national profile and has more than $100 million in the bank. DeSantis has become known for his battles over education, including how teachers talk to students about race, history and LGBTQ people. He's pushed new laws that restrict how conversations around those subjects take place in public school classrooms and even businesses. If he's to win in November, Crist will have to sway some of the nearly 4 million unaffiliated Florida voters. Registered Republicans now outnumber registered Democrats in the state, but statewide races have often been close. DeSantis, himself, won by about a single percentage point in 2018.

            "article_content": "Voters in Florida head to the polls Tuesday. Ukrainian workers man a nuclear power plant under the eyes of occupying Russian soldiers. More states are poised to enact abortion trigger bans this week.  RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: States holding primaries today include the state of Florida, one of the biggest. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: And the primary captures even more attention because of who's on the ballot there. Republican Governor Ron DeSantis is seeking a second term. He's made himself one of his party's national figures, fighting culture wars and showing up in 2024 presidential polls. But before he could run for that office, he would have to win reelection as governor. And Democrats are choosing his challenger today. Charlie Crist is a former governor and also a former Republican. (SOUNDBITE OF POLITICAL AD) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: I remember when we had a governor who knew his job was to look out for our jobs. CHARLIE CRIST: I remember that governor, too, 'cause that governor was me. INSKEEP: Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried says she is more progressive. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) NIKKI FRIED: Want to know the difference between me and Charlie Crist? It's not just that I'm pro-choice and he's pro-life. Look at our records on criminal justice. MARTIN: OK, so a former Republican and a progressive Democrat. For more on this race, we're joined by Insider's Kimberly Leonard. Kimberly, thanks for joining us this morning. KIMBERLY LEONARD: Good morning. MARTIN: How do things look down there? LEONARD: You know, polls show that Congressman Crist is expected to win the Democratic nomination for governor today. He's actually a former Republican and political independent, but he's positioned himself as a unifier in this race. It's kind of similar to how Joe Biden did when he successfully ran for president. Crist's message really seems to be resonating against DeSantis, someone a lot of people view as divisive. Now, having said that, if Fried does pull off an upset victory today, then she could be on track to become Florida's first female governor. She's a lifelong Democrat, and she's consistently supported abortion rights, and that's an issue that can mobilize voters in a post-Roe America. MARTIN: Interesting that the polling is so clear before people actually go out there and fill out their ballots. So I know this race has also been especially expensive, right? What can you tell us about campaign spending? LEONARD: That's right. Well, you know, DeSantis is one of the most famous Republicans in America right now, and that's helped him pull in big-dollar donors from all over the country. Just to put the numbers in perspective - he raised $142 million from the beginning of 2021 until early August. And that's an astounding amount of money, especially for a governor's race. He could even set a new national record when it comes to this kind of fundraising. MARTIN: But, I mean, let's assume that Crist does well and faces DeSantis. I mean, how well-positioned is he in a general election? I mean, sure, he used to be a Republican, but he's still running as a Democrat, and Florida has been considered a swing state for a long time, but, I mean, isn't that changing? Isn't it solidly red these days? LEONARD: You know, it is, and it has changed in a very short amount of time. For example, if you look at 2018, DeSantis only won the governor's race by about 32,000 votes. That's less than half a percentage point. Looking ahead to November, analysts really are predicting that he could sail to victory. We're talking even by double digits. And that's something that really just hasn't happened in Florida. But one of the main reasons why they think there's such a difference now is because Republicans have really been out-registering Democrats. And at this point, they have 231,000 more Republican votes. And so if you talk to analysts down here in Florida, they'll really tell you, yes, Florida is a red state now. MARTIN: There are new voting laws in Florida. What can you tell us about them? LEONARD: That's right. There are several new voting restrictions in Florida. There's the voter absentee rules which require voters to request ballots every election. That's instead of what it was before, where they could request one for two election cycles. And then there was an election police unit that last week announced it was arresting 20 people who fraudulently voted during the last election. But to put that in context, 11 million people in Florida voted during the last election. So critics point out that having only 20 fraudulent votes compared to those numbers show that voter fraud is very rare. MARTIN: Insider's Kimberly Leonard. Thank you. LEONARD: Thanks for having me. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MARTIN: International inspectors have not been able to secure a nuclear power plant occupied by Russian troops. It is still in a battle zone. INSKEEP: We've seen images of this plant since the start of the war in Ukraine. Russian soldiers, you may recall, fought their way in. They're now defending that area as Ukrainian troops push back. During all of that time, the plant has been operating. Civilians go to work there every day. MARTIN: NPR's Ashley Westerman talked to a former employee of the nuclear power plant who worked there for months after Russians took it over, and she joins us now. Ashley, introduce us to this person. ASHLEY WESTERMAN, BYLINE: Yeah, So I spoke with 32-year-old Andriy Tuz. He's a 10-year veteran at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant and has done a number of jobs throughout the years. But last year he got an offer to join the PR team as deputy, and he said yes. And then he actually became head of PR on February 24. And he says everything changed on March 3, when Russian tanks started rolling through the plant's checkpoints. MARTIN: And he was there, right? WESTERMAN: Yes or, rather, he was home in Enerhodar, which is the village closest to the plant. The village was attacked on March 3 and then the plant that night. ANDRIY TUZ: (Through interpreter) There was shooting. Not only the tanks were shooting, I also saw some incoming missiles above the city. Heard explosions that sounded just like the crackle of fireworks. WESTERMAN: And there were dozens of military vehicles about, and Tuz says many of the plant's buildings were hit by gunfire that night. And while it was scary, he and others who worked there actually figured they were in the safest place because they couldn't imagine either side attacking the area. MARTIN: Wow. I can't imagine the stress of that. I mean, what did he tell you about working at the plant? WESTERMAN: Tuz says that in the first days, even the first months, the Russians did not interfere in their work. They weren't allowed in their workplace or to approach the staff. But then things changed. TUZ: (Through interpreter) Russian soldiers started making the rounds and were forcing their way to the workplaces of the Ukrainian staff. WESTERMAN: He says it's not like they were interfering in the day-to-day operations, Rachel, but just having those soldiers around had a big psychological impact on the workers and their families. It's just a big emotional upheaval. And he says the plant went from some 11,500 personnel before the war down to 1,200 to 1,800 now, which has put even more pressure on those who have decided to stay. MARTIN: Yeah, I imagine. Has any of this affected the actual operation of the plant? WESTERMAN: So the plant, he says, has been running. The water stayed on, but there is no internet and very, very little phone service. But what's most problematic is that the Russians have also parked and moved a lot of military equipment and munitions in or near the complex. TUZ: (Through interpreter) Tanks and military vehicles were also constantly moving. Sometimes they were next to the power units. The staff didn't know what to do. They had their rounds to make. They needed to check the equipment, but there was a tank right in front of it. WESTERMAN: Tuz went to work every day for four months, but things just got progressively worse and worse as time went on. MARTIN: And he has since escaped Ukraine. Does he still keep in contact with people he knew who are working at the plant? WESTERMAN: Yes. And he's actually now in Switzerland. He says he still keeps in touch with his fellow workers at the plant. TUZ: (Through interpreter) They're made to stay at their workplace overtime during shelling. They don't have a normal work schedule, and much fewer people are available now. They don't have backup in case someone gets ill. There's enough staff, but it's much more difficult for them to perform their duties. WESTERMAN: He says people are scared, and they want to leave. But he calls them heroes for ensuring the safety of the plant under such pressure. And Tuz says the only right thing to keep the plant safe and the thousands still working inside is to demilitarize the plant altogether. MARTIN: NPR's Ashley Westerman reporting from Lviv. Thank you so much, Ashley. WESTERMAN: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) INSKEEP: How much has abortion law changed since the Supreme Court ruling? MARTIN: Two months ago, the court made a choice to eliminate the constitutional right to an abortion. Some states had trigger laws on the books to outlaw abortion. Others are debating it. Many face state court battles. And abortion advocates expect more new laws will be introduced next year. Here's Elisabeth Smith with the Center for Reproductive Rights. ELISABETH SMITH: We will also likely see novel criminal penalties for abortion providers and helpers and some states trying to prevent people from crossing state lines. INSKEEP: NPR national correspondent Sarah McCammon covers abortion rights policy. Hey there, Sarah. SARAH MCCAMMON, BYLINE: Good morning, Steve. INSKEEP: What is the count of states that have changed their laws in these two months? MCCAMMON: Well, so far, you know, many states had trigger bans, laws that were written to go into effect essentially as soon as the Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade was handed down. So already about eight states have total or near-total abortion bans in effect. That's according to the Center for Reproductive Rights. But, Steve, what's happening this week is, you know, others essentially had a waiting period in place, and there's also been some litigation up in the air in several states. So a handful of states are expected to have abortion bans take effect this week, Thursday or Friday. And we're talking about Tennessee, Texas and Idaho, as well as North Dakota. There's some litigation up in the air there. But unless a court intervenes, the date in North Dakota is Friday. INSKEEP: OK, so abortion would still be legal then in a majority of states, but an increasing number are banning them or coming very near that. What impacts are those laws having? MCCAMMON: Well, these new laws in many cases are already essentially in effect. I mean, the impact is already there. So Texas, we know that last year Texas had that state law banning most abortions after six weeks take effect in September. And more laws are on the books as well that have been triggered by the overturning of Roe v. Wade. At this point in Texas, Steve, there are no clinics providing abortions, a shift that really began, you know, months ago. Idaho has a similar law in effect to the one in Texas that is enforced through private lawsuits, but there's another law, again, that may go into effect later this week. North Dakota only has one remaining abortion clinic. It's already moved its services to Minnesota, at least for now, where abortion remains legal. And then Tennessee also has very limited abortion access because of a six-week ban there. But the law scheduled to take effect this week goes even further, an almost total ban with no exceptions for rape or incest. So we're just seeing kind of a deepening of what's already happening. INSKEEP: Yeah, that's a good word - deepening. We have laws on top of laws on top of laws. But you mentioned court battles challenging some of those laws. Where do those battles stand? MCCAMMON: Right. So abortion rights groups have been trying to argue that at least some state constitutions offer protections for abortion rights, even if the U.S. Constitution does not. And abortion rights opponents, of course, are pushing back. Erin Hawley is senior counsel with the anti-abortion group Alliance Defending Freedom, which is working to enforce abortion laws in several states, including Wyoming. And she hopes that more states will eventually let their abortion bans take effect. ERIN HAWLEY: I think we'll see a number of other states that these laws will come online, that the intermediate courts of appeals and the state supreme courts will hopefully find that there is no state constitutional right to abortion. Hopefully, Wyoming, Arizona - we'll get (ph) some of these other places as well. INSKEEP: Sarah, thanks for the update. MCCAMMON: Thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Charlie Crist lead the Democratic primary to try to defeat Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis. The final primary day of August has some key election contests in Florida, New York and Oklahoma. Florida and New York had their congressional maps scrambled by redistricting, boosting the number of notable races Tuesday. But the biggest matchup in Florida is at the top of the ticket, where Democrats will pick a nominee to try to defeat Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, a potential presidential contender in 2024. (Rep. Val Demings will also aim to lock up the Democratic nomination to take on GOP Sen. Marco Rubio.) In New York, voters are finally casting ballots in congressional races, months after the state's top court scrapped the legislature's map, ruling it unfairly benefited Democrats. The newly drawn map led to intraparty battles, mostly within solidly blue districts, as incumbent House members had to run in new districts, compete against colleagues or face a handful of challengers. New York also has two special congressional elections. And in the Republican stronghold of Oklahoma, runoff primary elections take place to fill a U.S. Senate term, and in the state's 2nd District. Florida's Democratic gubernatorial primary will likely come down to who voters believe has the best chance of defeating DeSantis in November. Rep. Charlie Crist is running against state Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried, the only statewide elected Democrat. Crist lost his last gubernatorial bid in 2014. But he was elected to serve as governor in 2006 as a Republican. Many state Democratic lawmakers, including some of the party's more progressive members, have expressed support for Crist. He also has endorsements from the Sierra Club and several labor unions, including the statewide teachers union. Fried has received endorsements from a handful of Democratic state representatives and the Florida College Democrats. Crist has also raised more money than Fried. Most polls have shown Crist leading Fried \u2014 and DeSantis leading both in hypothetical matchups. - FL-07: Eight Republicans are campaigning for a chance to fill outgoing Democratic Rep. Stephanie Murphy's seat, which contains parts of the Orlando suburbs and now skews Republican following redistricting. Leading among the GOP candidates are state Rep. Anthony Sabatini and controversial businessman Cory Mills \u2014 both of whom promote Donald Trump's lie that the 2020 election was stolen. - FL-10: Progressive activist Maxwell Alejandro Frost leads among a slew of Democrats in fundraising and national endorsements in the race to fill the solidly Democratic, Orlando-based seat left open by Demings' run for Senate. If elected, Frost, 25, would be the first member of Generation Z to serve in Congress. The Democratic field also includes state Sen. Randolph Bracy and former Rep. Alan Grayson. - FL-13: Florida's latest round of redistricting has also turned Crist's once-toss-up Democratic district, containing Clearwater and parts of St. Petersburg, into a competitive Republican playing field. Leading among Republican candidates is Air Force veteran Anna Paulina Luna, who's been endorsed by Trump. The winner of the GOP primary will go on to face former Obama official Eric Lynn in November. Rep. Carolyn Maloney greets a voter while campaigning on the Upper East Side neighborhood of Manhattan on Aug. 16. Maloney is running against attorney Suraj Patel and Rep.

Carolyn Maloney and Jerrold Nadler are both from New York City and were both first elected in 1992. They have largely voted the same, with a handful of key exceptions. Now, Maloney is making a pitch based on her work on women's rights \u2014 arguing that she is the best candidate to fight for reproductive health care in a post-Roe world. Nadler highlights his votes opposing the Iraq War and the Patriot Act, as well as his leading role in the Trump impeachment hearings. They're challenged by a third candidate, Suraj Patel, a former Obama aide who came within 4 percentage points of beating Maloney in 2020. Maloney has outraised her opponents, but Nadler has received some key endorsements, including from Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. Tuesday's winner is expected to take the House seat, since the district leans so heavily Democratic. But no matter the outcome, Democrats will lose at least one of their senior leaders in Congress. As Nadler takes on Maloney, a newly redrawn 10th District is open for the first time in nearly a decade. Daniel Goldman, the former legal counsel to House Democrats who spearheaded Trump's impeachment in 2019, is a leading candidate in the race, as are U.S. Rep. Mondaire Jones and state Assemblywoman Yuh-Line Niou. Assemblywoman Yuh-Line Niou, left, and Rep.

Jones \u2014 a freshman congressman currently representing District 17, located in the suburbs outside New York City \u2014 has been endorsed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the Congressional Progressive Caucus. But other progressive figures, such as fellow New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, have stayed out of the fray. - NY-19: In New York's Hudson Valley, two county executives, Democrat Pat Ryan and Republican Marc Molinaro, are locked in a close race to serve out the remaining four months of former Rep. Antonio Delgado's term. The Democrat Delgado resigned in May to serve as lieutenant governor. The district is considered a toss-up by the Cook Political Report, and Ryan and Molinaro are ideologically divided along party lines, notably splitting on the issue of abortion, making the race a key contest to watch as November inches closer. (A twist: Molinaro is running for a full term in the 19th District under the new congressional map, while Ryan is also running for a full term, but in the 18th District.) - NY-23: Republican Joe Sempolinski will face off against Democrat Max Della Pia for the remaining months of former Rep. Tom Reed's term. But Sempoliski, a former aide to Reed, is not running in the primary for a full term, despite the district being solidly Republican and the term only lasting until January. Instead, Della Pia, who is running in the primary unopposed, will go up against either state GOP Chair Nick Langworthy or controversial businessman Carl Paladino. Despite a first-place finish in June, Oklahoma U.S. Rep. Markwayne Mullin failed to get over 50% of the Senate GOP primary vote, forcing a runoff against former state House Speaker T.W.

Markwayne Mullin failed to get over 50% of the primary vote, forcing a runoff against former state House Speaker T.W. Shannon. Mullin has the endorsement of Trump and has out-fundraised Shannon. The winner of the runoff will face Democrat Kendra Horn in November. Both Mullin and Shannon have the potential to become the first Indigenous person to serve in the Senate since 2005. The contest to succeed Mullin in the 2nd Congressional District, which encompasses the eastern portion of the state, is also in a runoff on the GOP side. Both former state Sen. Josh Brecheen and state Rep. Avery Frix tout their support for Trump \u2014 though the former president has not issued an endorsement. Frix marginally leads against Brecheen, according to recent polling, but 42% of Republican respondents polled remain undecided. The winner goes against Democrat Naomi Andrews.

            "article_content": "Have the primaries given hints about the upcoming midterms? Terrorism charges are filed against Pakistan's ex-Prime Minister Imran Khan. A car bomb near Moscow killed the daughter of a key Putin ally.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: A special election for the House may give us clues to what's coming this fall. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: You may know the closely divided House and Senate are at stake. Republicans are favored to gain, as the party out of power often does, but they are feeling a little bit less optimistic these days. Last week, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell acknowledged what the experts say - it's getting harder to see how his party captures the Senate. It's a little hard to hear this, but listen closely to this clip. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MITCH MCCONNELL: There's probably a greater likelihood the House flips than the Senate. Senate races are just different. They're statewide. Candidate quality has a lot to do with the outcome. MARTIN: He said, candidate quality. Republicans have been struggling in states like Pennsylvania and Georgia. INSKEEP: Where their nominees have been much criticized. McConnell also said Republicans have a better chance to win the House. And that special election in New York state this week gives us more information. NPR senior political editor and correspondent Domenico Montanaro is here. Domenico, good morning. DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Hey there, Steve. INSKEEP: OK, just to be clear - not a primary, although we have some more primaries coming up this week. This is not a primary. It's an open seat. It gets decided. It's the final-final in New York state, outside of New York City, in the Hudson Valley, the Catskills, rural areas and some urban areas. What should we know about it? MONTANARO: Well, this is a race between Democrat Pat Ryan and Republican Marc Molinaro, both local county executives. It's to fill out a term for Anthony (ph) Delgado, who left Congress to become lieutenant governor of the state. It's a measure, really, of which party has the enthusiasm right now in a fairly even-divided district. You know, Trump won it in 2016. Biden won it in 2020. And I often like to look at candidates' ads to see what they're focusing on. These give you a pretty good idea. First, here's an ad from Ryan, who's an Army veteran. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: He fought for our families, for our freedom. PAT RYAN: And freedom includes a woman's right to choose. How can we be a free country if the government tries to control women's bodies? MONTANARO: Meanwhile, Molinaro is focusing on something entirely different. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Sky-high gas prices. (SOUNDBITE OF SCREAMING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Rising crime. (SOUNDBITE OF SCREAMING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Runaway inflation. (SOUNDBITE OF SCREAMING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Joe Biden and Nancy Pelosi are to blame. MONTANARO: (Laughter) So very dramatic there. But you can hear how this has become a proxy fight in the messaging wars on abortion rights versus inflation, the two big issues that both parties really want to focus on nationally. INSKEEP: Well, how big an indicator could a special election like this be? MONTANARO: Well, you never want to overread special elections, but they have been indicators in recent years of which party is most fired up and which way elections that are upcoming are headed. You know, Republicans did well in special elections earlier this cycle, but after the Supreme Court overturned Roe, Democrats have overperformed in places like Minnesota and Nebraska, and Democrats are looking to build on their momentum after a big win in Kansas on an abortion-related ballot measure. INSKEEP: With all that said, we should be clear - Republicans still have a good chance to win a lot of seats this fall, and we'll see how things turn out. But they've had some difficulty recently. So what is Donald Trump saying about this, particularly given that so many Republican candidates have pledged fealty to him? MONTANARO: Well, we heard that clip from McConnell, and Trump unloaded on McConnell on his social media platform. He called him a broken-down hack, criticized his wife, Elaine Chao, who you might remember was Trump's labor secretary but resigned over Trump's conduct on January 6. And he said that he thought McConnell should spend more time and money helping Republican Senate candidates get elected. Ironically, though, it's McConnell's outside group that's tied to him, the Senate Leadership Fund, that's spending some quarter-billion dollars in these elections, and Trump is the one who's spending pretty much nothing to support them. And McConnell-backed aides really feel like Trump has handed them a slate of candidates who are weaker, who they need to now try to push over the finish line. INSKEEP: NPR's Domenico Montanaro. Thanks. MONTANARO: You're welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) INSKEEP: Authorities in Pakistan have filed terrorism charges against a former prime minister. MARTIN: The Prime Minister is Imran Khan. He was ousted last spring in a no-confidence vote, and he's refused to accept his defeat. He gave a speech over the weekend criticizing police and a judge, and that is what has triggered the criminal charges. INSKEEP: NPR's Diaa Hadid is in the Pakistani capital, Islamabad. Hey there, Diaa. DIAA HADID, BYLINE: Good morning. INSKEEP: Exact words would matter here. What did Imran Khan seem to say? HADID: He had actually threatened to file cases against two senior police officers and a female judge. But in terms of the judge, he also said she should prepare herself, as actions would be taken against her. This coming from a man whose supporters are quite notorious for taking action into their own hands and threatening people online, at the very least. So it could have been interpreted as a threat against this woman. INSKEEP: OK. So he makes this statement. The police file this thing called a first information report, which is part of the criminal process in Pakistan. He hasn't been arrested yet, but there is a law enforcement activity against a former national leader. How have his supporters taken this news? HADID: Well, his supporters have rushed to his palatial home in Islamabad. They've formed a human barrier around it. And his lawyers have successfully appealed to the court to prevent his arrest until at least Thursday. I should add that it's not unusual in Pakistan for former prime ministers to have these sorts of actions taken against them once they fall out of favor. INSKEEP: Certainly there are some former prime ministers who've ended up in prison over the years, but why would the authorities, the current authorities, the coalition government that took over, go after him now if, in fact, that's the way that we should think of this? HADID: It seems that he is losing the patience of Pakistan's security establishment, which is the country's most powerful institution. If I can step back a bit, you see; he was in power and was widely seen as being propelled to power with the military support, but he was ousted in April when he lost a no-confidence motion. And that was seen as coming around because the military had signaled that it no longer supported him. But Khan, like many civilian leaders in Pakistan, hasn't accepted that result. He's been staging large rallies around the country, where he's been critical of the military for not supporting his party. And that's key because that's pushed him into dangerous political territory here. And it came around - in mid August, things really seemed to escalate. Authorities arrested his chief aide, whom they accuse of inciting against the military, calling on soldiers to disobey orders. They've shut down pro-Khan TV stations. And by Saturday, the government seemed to have had enough. Authorities blocked the live transmission of his speech at a rally. And when his supporters said they'd carry it on dozens of YouTube channels live, the government blocked YouTube. And then he was charged. INSKEEP: It sounds like he still has a lot of supporters around the country. HADID: Khan does have a lot of supporters around the country, and this crisis, which has gone on for months, has really elevated him even more. He's winning by-elections across Pakistan right now. But he's also bitterly polarized the country. He's painted the opposition as traitors. He's even claimed that he was ousted from power because of a coup that was orchestrated by Washington. There's no evidence to support that, but again, he's used that grievance to fuel his popularity even more. And now what comes next? Well, if he is arrested, that could lead to street violence between security forces and Khan loyalists. Could it do more than that? I spoke to one seasoned analyst here, Mosharraf Zaidi. He says broad unrest is unlikely, but taking action against Khan won't help this government. MOSHARRAF ZAIDI: What it is doing is enhancing Imran Khan's brand. Every act of desperation on the part of the military high command further reinforces the anti-status-quo brand that Imran Khan has very carefully and very fortuitously honed. HADID: So the challenge facing the government and the military now is how they silence Khan without making him more popular. INSKEEP: NPR's Diaa Hadid. Thanks so much. HADID: Thank you, Steve. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) INSKEEP: Some other news now. A car bomb in Moscow has killed the daughter of a far-right Russian ideologue who was an ally of President Vladimir Putin. MARTIN: Aleksandr Dugin's ideas and writing influenced the Kremlin's narrative for the invasion of Ukraine. His daughter, Darya Dugina, shared his views and spread disinformation and conspiracy theories about the war in Ukraine as a commentator on Russian nationalist TV. Russia's investigative committee has opened a criminal murder case. It is unknown whether she, her father or both were the target of the attack. INSKEEP: Let's turn now to Max Seddon. He is the Moscow bureau chief for the Financial Times. He is in Riga, Latvia, at the moment. Welcome. MAX SEDDON: Good morning. INSKEEP: I don't want to be flip about this, but normally, it's people who criticize Vladimir Putin who get mysteriously killed. What does it mean that someone who seems to be in Putin's orbit was assassinated? SEDDON: Well, this is the first time that there has been any real serious blowback for supporters of the war within Moscow itself. Something Putin's been very successful at throughout the war is maintaining a sense of normalcy in Moscow, not just for ordinary people but also for the elite who are, you know, part of the state TV and propaganda apparatus. Life is largely going on as normal. There isn't wartime mobilization that you would have if they, you know, officially declared a war, which they haven't done. So this is the first time that the war has come home to them. And it's certainly a shock to a lot of the people, you know, who knew Darya Dugina, who know Aleksandr Dugin, who move in these circles. The editor of Russia Today, Margarita Simonyan, where Darya Dugina occasionally appeared as a guest, wrote that she has been followed around by bodyguards everywhere for the last few months because of threats to her own life. And certainly there is a sense that they are having to deal with some blowback finally here, six months into the war. INSKEEP: Granting that authorities have said they're going to investigate, are we likely to get what we would accept as credible information about what happened here? SEDDON: I would expect not. I think what's really going to be significant here is - so you could compare it to the murder of one of Stalin's top aides, Sergei Kirov, in 1934, where it was, yeah, decades before there was any clue from evidence as to who really was behind it, but what was important was how it was used. And I think that would be the most important thing to watch here. So if they blame this on Ukraine, will this be used as justification for further attacks on Ukraine? If they blame this on some sort of Russian dissident movement, like the one that has apparently claimed responsibility, will that be used to justify further repression inside Russia? And I think that will be the best indication of how Russia is treating this, is a - who is the victim of reprisals for this attack? INSKEEP: I guess we should note that Ukraine has denied any involvement here. But is the Kremlin signaling who they are intending to blame? SEDDON: The Kremlin has - from state propaganda, has obviously already blamed Ukraine. It certainly seems that professionals were involved in doing this. It was a remote-detonating bomb, according to the investigators. There's also a Russian partisan group that has claimed responsibility, but there is a lot of suspicion about whether they really exist. You know, could they be a front for Ukrainian special ops? Could they be a front for the FSB? Really, nobody knows. And what's certain is this seems like professionals were behind this, and the consequences are going to be felt for some time. INSKEEP: Max Seddon of the Financial Times. Thanks so much. SEDDON: Thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "After a court ruling Friday, abortion in Michigan continues to be legal for now - though there are more legal challenges ahead.  SCOTT SIMON, HOST: Abortion remains legal in Michigan for the time being. Michigan Judge Jacob Cunningham granted a preliminary injunction, which means a 1931 law that bans abortion and allows providers to be charged with felony remains on hold. It is the latest in a back-and-forth legal argument that abortion rights advocates and opponents say is not over yet. Rick Pluta of the Michigan Public Radio Network has been following the case and joins us. Rick, thanks for being with us. RICK PLUTA, BYLINE: You bet. SIMON: This quarrel began even before the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. And this ruling from Judge Cunningham is kind of the latest installment. How did we get to this point? PLUTA: Well, we had a couple of court cases. In one, a judge ruled the state of Michigan cannot charge abortion providers under that 1931 state law - not really an issue since Democratic Attorney General Dana Nessel says that's not going to happen. But there are Republican prosecutors in several Michigan counties who say they would or might file charges against abortion providers. And they went to court, and Judge Cunningham said no to that. And here's part of the ruling he read from the bench. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JACOB CUNNINGHAM: (Reading) A person carrying a child has the right to bodily autonomy and integrity, as well as a safe doctor-patient relationship, free from government interference as they have been able to do so for nearly 50 years. Weaponizing the criminal law against providers to force pregnancy on our state's women is simply contrary to notions of due process, equal protection and bodily autonomy in this court's eyes. PLUTA: So Judge Cunningham also said he thinks Governor Gretchen Whitmer will prevail on the issue of whether abortion rights are protected in Michigan. SIMON: And what's been the reaction to the judge's ruling? PLUTA: Well, as you'd expect, abortion rights advocates are very pleased. Dr. Natasha Bagdasarian is Michigan's chief medical executive. She was appointed by Governor Whitmer, and she says the ruling will lay to rest some immediate concerns about the status of abortion rights under a law that's not been invoked in Michigan in roughly 50 years. And here's what she told us. NATASHA BAGDASARIAN: It actually criminalizes anything that induces miscarriage. And I think that this is confusing for both doctors and patients around the state. SIMON: Rick, it sounds like this - the question isn't really settled with this ruling. PLUTA: It isn't. First of all, those Republican prosecutors, they say they're not giving up. David Kallman is their attorney and has made it clear that Judge Cunningham's decision is not the end. DAVID KALLMAN: OK, well, he made his ruling and we'll take it up and see what the higher courts think. PLUTA: So the next stop will be the Michigan Court of Appeals. And the deadline to file a challenge is 21 days. SIMON: And I understand there's a petition drive underway to amend the state's constitution. How does that figure into this? PLUTA: Yeah. This petition campaign has submitted roughly 750,000 signatures to get a question on the ballot. It should easily qualify. The group wants to add a reproductive rights amendment to the state constitution. And if they're successful, well, this all might get settled on election day. SIMON: And where does Governor Whitmer stand in all this? PLUTA: Well, she has a formal request into the Michigan Supreme Court asking it to step over lower courts, take over this case and declare abortion rights are protected under the Michigan constitution, regardless of the fate of a ballot question. SIMON: Rick Pluta, senior political correspondent for the Michigan Public Radio Network. Rick, thanks so much. PLUTA: My pleasure.

            "article_content": "Abortion is still legal in Michigan after a circuit court judge ruled that county prosecutors can't charge providers with a felony. The decision blocks the enforcement of a 1931 pre-Roe abortion ban.  MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: A ruling today means abortion will remain legal in Michigan, at least for now. Michigan Judge Jacob Cunningham says an abortion ban on the state's books cannot be enforced right now. This is a law that dates back to 1931. The judge suggested that not blocking it could be catastrophic. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JACOB CUNNINGHAM: Though the court appreciates both sides of this debate are passionate in their convictions, by not issuing an injunction today, the court would send the health care system into crisis, the extreme costs of which would then be put on the women of our great state. KELLY: Well, today marks a big victory for abortion rights advocates and for people who'd flock to Michigan from other states that have banned abortion in recent months. There's been a lot of confusion over enforcement of this nearly century-old state law, and the confusion may not end with today's decision, as Rick Pluta of the Michigan Public Radio Network is here to explain. Hey, Rick. RICK PLUTA, BYLINE: Hello. KELLY: Hi. So I know there are a bunch of legal fights underway in Michigan over abortion. Just situate the significance of this particular case. PLUTA: Sure. There is actually a different court ruling that says that the state of Michigan cannot file charges against abortion providers. But that's a non-issue because Michigan's Democratic attorney general, Dana Nessel, says that's not going to happen. So this injunction says that, for now at least, local prosecutors, county prosecutors cannot file charges either. And that's despite the fact that some Republican prosecutors say, well, that should be their call. KELLY: OK. So a lot going on. But, again, just to repeat - for now, abortions will remain available. What has been the reaction today in Michigan to this? PLUTA: Well, sure. As you would expect, pro-choice groups say that this is great news, even it's just a respite. And those Republican prosecutors - well, they're not happy. Their attorney is David Kallman, and here's what he had to say. DAVID KALLMAN: I don't know. I mean, the judges ruled. That's their job. That's what he does. You know, he did. We disagree. We're going to appeal. That's the way the process works. We're going to go up the court of appeals. PLUTA: So next stop, another court. But like I said, pro-choice groups say this is good news. This is Michigan Chief Medical Executive Natasha Bagdasarian, and she says the alternative to this decision is a lot of fear and a lot of confusion. NATASHA BAGDASARIAN: I think it really chills that sort of doctor-patient private relationship. I'm also concerned about physicians around the state of Michigan under fear of prosecution for actually performing their duty to their patients. KELLY: Meanwhile, Rick, there's a call for a constitutional amendment. What's going on there? How does that factor in? PLUTA: So another twist - a petition campaign has submitted 700,000-plus signatures to put a reproductive rights amendment on the November ballot. Today's decision, if it holds up, will keep things as they are until after the November election. KELLY: OK. And one more twist - the governor of Michigan, Gretchen Whitmer, is looking for a more definitive answer on all this. She's looking to the state Supreme Court. PLUTA: That's right. This is actually kind of where this case began, that Governor Gretchen Whitmer filed this case. But one of the things that she asked for was for the Michigan Supreme Court to step in, circumvent the lower courts and take this case right away and rule that abortion rights are already protected under the Michigan Constitution. KELLY: Lots to keep you busy. Rick Pluta of the Michigan Public Radio Network, thanks. PLUTA: Oh, you bet. Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Wade. LANSING, Mich. \u2014 A Michigan judge on Friday blocked county prosecutors from enforcing the state's 1931 ban on abortion for the foreseeable future after two days of witness testimony from abortion experts, providers and the state's chief medical officer. The ruling comes after the state Court of Appeals said earlier this month that county prosecutors were not covered by a May order and could enforce the prohibition following the fall of Roe v. Wade by the U.S. Supreme Court. \"The harm to the body of women and people capable of pregnancy in not issuing the injunction could not be more real, clear, present and dangerous to the court,\" Oakland County Judge Jacob Cunningham said during his ruling Friday. David Kallman, an attorney representing two Republican county prosecutors, said an appeal is planned. \"The judge ignored all of the clear legal errors and problems in this case, it appears to me, simply because the issue is abortion,\" Kallman told The Associated Press following the hearing. Cunningham had filed a restraining order against county prosecutors hours after the Aug. 1 appeals court decision and following a request from attorneys representing Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. While a majority of prosecutors in counties where there are abortion clinics have said they will not enforce the ban, Republican prosecutors in Kent, Jackson and Macomb counties have said they should be able to enforce the 1931 law. Cunningham listened to arguments Wednesday and Thursday in Pontiac before granting the preliminary injunction, which is expected to keep abortion legal throughout the state until the Michigan Supreme Court or voters could decide in the fall. In his ruling, Cunningham found all three of the state's witnesses \"extremely credible\" while dismissing testimony from the defense witnesses as \"unhelpful and biased.\" The 1931 law in Michigan, which was triggered after the U.S. Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, bans abortion in all instances except the life of the mother. The dormant ban was retroactively blocked from going into effect in May when Judge Elizabeth Gleicher issued a preliminary injunction. The state Court of Appeals later said that the preliminary injunction only applied to the attorney general's office, meaning that providers could get charged with a felony by some county prosecutors. While Kallman said during closing arguments Thursday that granting a preliminary injunction isn't how laws should be changed, attorneys representing Whitmer argued that allowing county prosecutors to decide whether to enforce the 1931 ban would cause confusion. \"I'm relieved that everyone in this state knows that it doesn't matter what county you live in now, you are not as a provider going to be prosecuted,\" Oakland County Prosecutor Karen McDonald said following the ruling A ballot initiative seeking to enshrine abortion rights into the state's constitution turned in 753,759 signatures in July and is expected to ultimately decide the status abortion access in Michigan. The amendment awaits final approval for the November ballot by the state's Board of Canvassers. \"This court finds it is overwhelmingly in the public's best interest to let the people of the great state of Michigan decide this matter at the ballot box,\" Cunningham said Friday. The status of abortion in Michigan is expected to drastically impact the battleground state's November general election, where Whitmer and Attorney General Dana Nessel, also a Democrat, have made abortion rights a centerpiece of their reelection campaigns. \"Absent this preliminary injunction, physicians face a very real threat of prosecution depending on where they practice,\" Nessel said in a statement issued following Friday's ruling.",

She says she's a \"confused\" voter \u2014 a registered Democrat who feels Republicans did a better job of managing the economy. ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. \u2014 Americans consistently say the economy is their biggest concern \u2014 specifically, the soaring cost of living. For months, polls have indicated that a majority of Americans do not approve of how President Biden has handled the economy. \"The cost of living \u2014 it's just crazy,\" said Debbie Pisco, a 67-year-old retiree who is on a fixed income, as she loaded groceries into her car outside Walmart in Pinellas Park, Fla. The broader Tampa metro area has seen some of the highest inflation rates in the country: 11.2% in the latest government data in August. Pisco's solution: elect more Republicans in midterm elections this November. She said Democrats \"are not doing anything \u2014 they're just making things worse.\" President Biden listens during a meeting with CEOs on the economy at the White House in July.\n                \n                    \n                    Susan Walsh/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption President Biden listens during a meeting with CEOs on the economy at the White House in July. While Pisco's blunt, bleak economic outlook is fairly common among people in Pinellas County, her political prescription is not universal. The health of the economy, like most issues in modern politics, is increasingly viewed through a partisan lens. This is a rare \"boomerang\" county, meaning it voted for President Barack Obama, then President Donald Trump and subsequently Biden. In years past, it would have been a competitive district for the midterms, but recent redistricting has made most districts in Florida uncompetitive. But it's still an ideal political microcosm to get a pulse on how people feel about the president. In more than two dozen interviews across Pinellas County, Republicans and Democrats alike expressed frustration with the economy. Republicans blamed the president. Democrats blamed global forces, the pandemic and interrupted supply chains. They also pointed out that other countries around the world have far higher inflation rates. But it's unclear how negative views of the economy will filter down to voters' political choices. Cartons of eggs are seen for sale in this Aug. 15 file photo.

In the last midterm elections in 2018, Republicans had hoped that a relatively strong economy under then-President Trump would save them from losses. But that strategy did not pan out. A post-mortem by the New York Times found that there wasn't a clear correlation between the economy and 2018 election results. But four years ago, people felt relatively happy with the economy. Now, they don't. And the question is whether pessimism over the state of the economy affects how people feel about Biden \u2014 and ultimately, how and whether they vote in November. As Jill Mallen packed groceries into a bag at a food pantry in St. Petersburg, she complained about how grocery prices have shot up. The 62-year-old bone cancer survivor is on disability and said the pantry has become her main source of food. \"I can't afford to go to Aldi and places like I used to go,\" she said. \"I don't have money left over with the increase and everything ... to go to the grocery store.\" Mallen owns her home but said she currently can't afford insurance on it because homeowners insurance rates have increased. She said the economy was better under Trump. So now, she feels politically confused. \"I'm a registered Democrat,\" she said. \"I have issues with our former president ... I don't like the untruths that took over with that party \u2014 even though I like the economy better.\" Maranda Douglas (left), 32, moved back in with her mom Deirdre to save money.

She's a Democrat but says her view of the economy doesn't mesh with the White House descriptions of a booming job market. But for some voters, economic frustration isn't limited to inflation. It's about messaging and credibility. The White House often touts the low unemployment rate and record job creation as evidence of a strong economy. But Maranda Douglas, a Democrat, said her first-hand experience in the current economy isn't matching the job market Biden and his team describe. \"I thought I went the high road. I got my bachelor's degree,\" said Douglas. \"I'm applying for jobs that I feel like I'm qualified for, that I should be paid well for. But I'm not getting that feedback.\" This week, the 32-year-old is moving back into her mom's house \u2014 with her daughter and boyfriend \u2014 to save money. \"It's a little disheartening because we were really trying to establish our independence,\" she said. Her mom Deirdre Douglas said that most of the homes in their neighborhood now house multigenerational families because home prices are beyond reach for young adults. Christina Willette, a mom of four, says she voted for Biden, but has felt more financial pressure since he entered office. \"That's who I picked, but it seems like that's when it started,\" she said.\n                \n                    \n                    Asma Khalid/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Christina Willette, a mom of four, says she voted for Biden, but has felt more financial pressure since he entered office. \"That's who I picked, but it seems like that's when it started,\" she said. The struggle to find affordable housing is common in Pinellas County, which has seen an influx of new residents in recent years. \"Rent prices are really \u2014 they're too high,\" said Christina Willette, a certified nursing assistant who makes $15 an hour. She said the rent on her two-bedroom apartment has gone up more than $600 a month over the last couple of years. \"It's like you can't do anything fun with the kids or with family, 'cause the only money you have is really for bills,\" she said. The mom of four said she began feeling financially squeezed when Biden came into office. \"That's who I picked,\" she said. \"But it seems like that's when it started.\" She doesn't blame Biden; she said she would never have voted for Trump because she thought he was sexist and divisive. But if Biden runs for president again, she said she probably won't vote for him. If anything, she said she's been more impressed by how her Republican governor, Ron DeSantis \u2014 who many believe has presidential ambitions \u2014 has handled the economy. She said she liked how he tried to keep schools and businesses open throughout the pandemic, so people like her could continue to work.

But instead of a house, he had to find a roommate, because his rent went up $400 this year. \"I have a master's degree, six years of experience and two jobs, and I don't feel like I can just, like, live comfortably in the world,\" Muha said. \"I knew I wasn't going to be rich when I got a degree in history, you know what I mean? But I would like to just be able to live comfortably.\" Muha voted for Biden \"very reluctantly.\" He said he wishes the president would follow through on his campaign promise to forgive a portion of student debt. He feels like Democrats take their base for granted \u2014 but he said he probably will still vote for the party in the November midterms. A majority of eligible voters won't vote in midterms. And research shows nonvoters tend to be people who don't have as much money. \"The food prices are ridiculous,\" said Kevin Connors, a 41-year-old security guard grabbing a free dinner on a recent evening through the nonprofit Feeding Tampa Bay. \"Our government blaming Ukraine and everybody for our gas prices is ridiculous. The housing is ridiculous.\" Connors, who makes about $16 an hour, said he hasn't voted in years. He said he's disillusioned with all his choices. Political experts say midterms are won not by persuading people like Connors, but by energizing the already-existing base. For the midterms, congressional Democrats plan to run on the Inflation Reduction Act that they recently passed, some $700 billion in spending that Biden described as \"delivering progress and prosperity to American families.\" The White House plans to hit the road this month to promote the package, which locks in lower premiums for people who have Affordable Care Act coverage, provides rebates for climate change-curbing appliances and vehicles, and allows Medicare to negotiate prices on some prescription drugs \u2014 although some of these benefits won't take effect until after the November elections. \"Every single Republican in the Congress sided with the special interests in this vote,\" Biden said, noting that pharmaceutical companies and corporations had fought the bill. \"That's the choice we face: we can protect the already-powerful, or show the courage to build the future where everybody has an even shot.\" President Biden spoke about inflation at the Port of Los Angeles in July.

The White House has struggled with its messaging on the issue. Back in Florida, Pam McAloon, president of the Pinellas Federated Republican Women's club, said the economy is extremely important to GOP voters, but it isn't the sole motivating factor. She thinks the FBI search of Trump's home at Mar-a-Lago could rally people. \"When you see a former president being treated the way he was treated just recently, that's really gonna energize people [to] go out and vote,\" she said. Anger is often effective at motivating voters. And Democrats insist their base is angry too \u2014 about rights being stripped away from them. Jennifer Griffin, an OB-GYN who performs abortions in the area, said her patients are furious about the series of rules imposed on them by the Florida state legislature \u2014 the 24-hour waiting period for an abortion, and the 15-week ban, for example. \"They're angry. And they say, 'What can I do about it?'\" Griffin explained. \"I said the one thing you can do is vote. The second thing you can do is get everyone you know to vote.\" While polling suggests voters have concerns about the economy, the political story in real life is complicated. The economy is the single issue voters repeatedly point to in surveys as their biggest concern. But in interviews in this county, it seems like it's not the primary factor driving many people's political decisions. \"No one's gonna change their point of view because of the economy,\" said Gretchen Johnson, president of the local chapter of the League of Women Voters, explaining the economy is already baked in to voters' calculations. \"Either you're gonna blame Joe Biden or you're not gonna blame Joe Biden for inflation, and gas and all that stuff,\" she said.",

            "article_content": "Loading... Nearly two dozen states have moved to restrict abortion or ban it altogether since the reversal of Roe v. Wade \u2014 meaning more people, especially those with low incomes and from marginalized communities, will be forced to carry unwanted pregnancies to term. So are states prepared to pay for the infrastructure needed to support these parents and children? The data paints a grim picture for many families: Mothers and children in states with the toughest abortion restrictions tend to have less access to health care and financial assistance, as well as worse health outcomes. Stuart Butler, a senior fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution, calls the end of Roe \"a double whammy\" for people who live in these states, which are mostly in the South. \"They are far less likely to have assistance for themselves and their children, and they are far less likely to have health care available to them when they are pregnant and for their children,\" he tells Morning Edition. \"And that means that there's going to be not only more hardship, but greater health problems and maternal deaths and so on ... unless there is a fundamental change in political behavior in those states.\" As NPR has reported, a large body of research shows that being denied an abortion limits peoples' education, time in the workforce and wages, with the economic consequences extending well into the lives of their children. One groundbreaking project called The Turnaway Study spent a decade comparing the experiences of people who had abortions with those who wanted abortions but were denied them, and found that those who were denied treatment experienced worse economic and mental health outcomes than those who received care. Dr. Diana Greene Foster, the demographer behind the study, told NPR in May that the findings show that pregnant people who are unable to get a safe, legal abortion and end up carrying the pregnancy to term will experience long-term physical and economic harm. \"We haven't become a more generous country that supports low-income mothers,\" she added. \"And so those outcomes are still the outcomes that people will experience when they are denied a wanted abortion.\" Republican opposition has prevented Congress from passing nationwide measures like federally protected family leave and an extended child tax credit that would expand the social safety net, leaving various forms of support for low-income and vulnerable families up to each state. Abortion access is now up to states too, after the Supreme Court's ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization. The case challenged a Mississippi law banning abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy, which a lower court had ruled unconstitutional. As of mid-August, 14 states have banned abortions entirely, and nearly a dozen others have moved to do the same. Even before the Dobbs ruling, the 14 states with the most restrictive abortion laws had the worst maternal and child health outcomes in the country, according to an amicus brief filed on behalf of Jackson Women's Health Organization by the American Public Health Association (APHA), the Guttmacher Institute, the Center for U.S. Policy and hundreds of public health scholars and professionals. The brief cites poorer maternal and child health outcomes across existing risk measures, including mistimed and unwanted pregnancy, low infant birth weight, infant mortality, child poverty and adverse childhood experiences. (It also notes that Mississippi \u2014 at the center of the Dobbs case \u2014 ranked last in the Commonwealth Fund's 2020 composite score for health system performances on measures including \"overall preventable mortality\" and \"children without appropriate preventive care.\") These findings are echoed in similar analyses by Evaluating Priorities, the  Brookings Institution, the Associated Press, the New York Times and others. NPR looked at indicators related to maternal and infant health outcomes, as well as policies states have in place to support families, in the 14 states with abortion bans in effect as of early August: Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas and Wisconsin. Here's what the data show. Eight of the 12 states that have not expanded their Medicaid programs have banned abortion already, while at least two others are attempting to do so, leaving many people without any affordable health insurance options.\n                \n                    \n                    Brandon Bell/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Eight of the 12 states that have not expanded their Medicaid programs have banned abortion already, while at least two others are attempting to do so, leaving many people without any affordable health insurance options. Many of the states with abortion bans are the same ones that have chosen not to expand their Medicaid programs, leaving many people without any affordable health insurance options. A brief refresher: A provision in the Affordable Care Act expanded Medicaid to nearly all American adults with household incomes up to 138% of the federal poverty level, making millions of people newly eligible for coverage. But a 2012 Supreme Court ruling left it up to each state to decide whether to participate. Thirty-nine states and Washington, D.C., have adopted the Medicaid expansion to date, according to a tracker from the Kaiser Family Foundation. Twelve have not. That creates a coverage gap, leaving more than 2 million Americans without health insurance options because they make too much money to qualify for Medicaid but not enough to be able to get subsidized private coverage in the Affordable Care Act marketplaces. The 12 states that have not expanded Medicaid are: Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Wisconsin and Wyoming. Eight of them have banned abortion already, while at least two others are attempting to do so. Medicaid currently finances about 42% of U.S. births. It also covers a majority of births for people with low incomes, amounting to millions of births annually, says Dr. Laurie Zephyrin, an OB-GYN who leads the maternal health work at the Commonwealth Fund. And Medicaid coverage provides access to all sorts of invaluable services for people of reproductive age, she adds, from prenatal care and case management services to births, doula services and some postpartum care, traditionally up to 60 days after birth. A provision of the 2021 American Rescue Plan gives all states the option to extend Medicaid postpartum care to up to 12 months after birth. As of mid-August, 33 states and Washington, D.C., either have implemented or plan to implement that extension, according to a tracker from the Kaiser Family Foundation. Abortion restrictive states are less likely to do so, Zephyrin tells NPR. More than 150 economists wrote in a Supreme Court amicus brief that access to legal abortion has led to lower rates of children in poverty.\n                \n                    \n                    Rick Bowmer/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption More than 150 economists wrote in a Supreme Court amicus brief that access to legal abortion has led to lower rates of children in poverty. Abortion ban states have some of the highest child poverty rates in the nation, according to a tracker from the Center for American Progress based on U.S. Census data. Mississippi is the worst-ranked state, coming in at No. 51 with a child poverty rate of 27.9% \u2014 meaning that more than one in four children in Mississippi lives in poverty. More than half of the states in the bottom 10 for child poverty have banned abortion: Alabama, Arkansas, Kentucky, South Carolina, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Mississippi. The notable outlier is New Mexico, which has the third worst child poverty rate in the country but no major abortion restrictions (and is already seeing an influx of patients from Texas and other nearby states). More than 150 economists wrote in a Supreme Court amicus brief that access to legal abortion has led to lower rates of children in poverty, as well as mothers attaining higher levels of education and professional occupations. Researchers have drawn those conclusions by comparing the experiences of pregnant people in states that loosened abortion restrictions in the 1960s, compared to those in states that did not. People who seek abortions are more likely to be living below the poverty line, to already have children and to be experiencing a disruptive life event, all factors that can make it difficult to care for a child, Isabel Sawhill and Morgan Welch of the Brookings Institution pointed out in a recent blog post. They write that adverse consequences for people who were denied a wanted abortion include financial hardship and health complications as well as, in certain cases, the need to raise a child alone or remain in abusive relationships, all of which will impact their child's well-being as well as their own.

One measure of infant health is how much a baby weighs at birth. Low birth weight is defined as when a baby is born weighing less than 5 pounds, 8 ounces. It is most often the result of preterm birth or fetal growth restriction, though there are numerous medical and environmental risk factors. While some babies with low birth weight are healthy despite their size, others can experience serious health problems, as the nonprofit March of Dimes explains. Some of those may require immediate treatment in the newborn intensive care unit, like brain bleeding or breathing problems, while other conditions could present later in life, such as diabetes and intellectual or developmental disabilities. CDC data shows that many of the states with the toughest abortion restrictions are also the ones with the highest rates of low birth weight. Five of the bottom six states \u2014 Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina and Louisiana \u2014 have abortion bans in place, while Wyoming's near-total abortion ban is delayed by court order. The problem is especially pervasive among communities of color, with Black babies much more likely than others to weigh less than they should at birth. For comparison, about 1 in 7 Black babies in the U.S. have low birth weight, compared to roughly 1 in 14 white babies. Some researchers have explored a direct connection between states' reproductive rights and rates of low birth weight: One 2020 UCLA study found that women living in states with the least restrictive reproductive rights policies had a 7% lower risk of having a child with a low birth weight, and that Black women in those states had an 8% lower risk. Looking at birth outcomes more broadly, CDC data from 2020 shows that states with abortion restrictions also tend to be the ones with the highest infant mortality rates. More than half of the 10 states with the highest infant mortality rates already have abortion bans in place (Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, Alabama, South Dakota and Ohio). West Virginia has a law banning abortion after 20 weeks, though a judge has blocked enforcement of a ban from 1849. An examination room at Whole Woman's Health of South Bend, Indiana.

The state has a high percentage of people living in maternity care deserts, posing a risk to maternal and infant health. Access to quality maternity care is crucial to the health of mothers and their babies, but is lacking in many parts of the country \u2014 and especially in states with restrictive abortion laws. A 2020 March of Dimes report found that some 2.2 million women of childbearing age live in maternity care deserts, or places where there is no hospital offering obstetric care, no birth center and no obstetric provider. Another 4.8 million live in counties with limited access to maternity care. An analysis from Stacker.com used federal data to calculate which percentage of a state's population lives in counties without access to maternal care, in line with March of Dimes' definition. The highest was Mississippi, where 23.5% of the population lives in a maternal care desert. All told, eight out of the 10 states with the most people living in maternity care deserts have abortion bans: Mississippi, South Dakota, Arkansas, Missouri, Oklahoma, Alabama, Kentucky and Louisiana. Within the top 15, two other states \u2014 Idaho and North Dakota \u2014 have abortion bans pending \u2014 and another two \u2014 Iowa and West Virginia \u2014 have bans on hold. And that lack of maternity care, whether due to lack of services or barriers to accessing it, poses a huge risk. People who do not get prenatal care are five times more likely to die of pregnancy-related causes than those who do, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. The U.S. as a whole already struggles with maternal mortality, an issue that's been exacerbated by the pandemic and disproportionately affects people of color. Even before the Supreme Court overturned Roe, states with more restrictive abortion policies tended to have higher maternal mortality rates, according to data from the CDC. And a growing body of research has underscored the explicit connection between abortion laws and maternal mortality. For instance, a 2020 study published in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine found that states that enacted laws to restrict abortions based on gestation age increased their maternal mortality rate by 38%. \"We have data already that in the U.S. healthcare system, there's failure to support the health of women and pregnant people and ensure reproductive health outcomes, particularly for Black and brown communities, for low-income communities, for people living in underserved areas,\" says Zephyrin, of the Commonwealth Fund. Abortion bans are \"another piece that we're adding on top of these already existing structural risks and fragility.\" Many of the most restrictive abortion states make it harder for families to get cash assistance, take time away from work and earn a living wage.\n                \n                    \n                    Leigh Vogel/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Many of the most restrictive abortion states make it harder for families to get cash assistance, take time away from work and earn a living wage. It's also important to look at what policies and forms of assistance states have in place to support families and children after they're born. Many of the most restrictive abortion states make it harder for families to get cash assistance, take time away from work, earn a living wage and access affordable childcare, among other factors. That's no coincidence, says Elizabeth Lower-Basch, the director of the income and work supports team at the Center for Law and Social Policy (CLASP). She tells NPR that while many of these states are reluctant to raise taxes or spend more money on social programs (which she says in itself is a legacy of institutional racism), they support banning abortion because \u2013 at least until the Dobbs ruling \u2013 it was largely symbolic, free of costs as well as consequences. \"Supporting childcare, supporting better prenatal care, supporting better schools, all that actually costs money,\" she says. \"Voting for an abortion ban, you don't need to pay for it in the state budget even if it is going to drive up your healthcare or other costs.\" One clear example: Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, or TANF, is harder to come by \u2014 both in terms of amount and availability \u2014 in states with restrictive abortion policies. (The federal government gives states grants to provide low-income families with financial assistance and other support services, and leaves funding allocation and eligibility for cash assistance largely up to states to decide.) The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities measures this with its \"TANF-to-poverty ratio\" (TPR), which calculates how many out of every 100 families in poverty receive TANF assistance each year. In a brief released earlier this year, it said that nationwide number had reached its lowest point in history in 2020 and pointed to states where access is especially limited. Seven of the 14 states with the lowest TPR's (of 10 or less) have abortion bans, while several others have bans pending or on hold. The worst-ranking states are Texas, Mississippi, Louisiana and Arkansas, where four out of every 100 families in poverty have access to TANF. The Center also tracks what percentage of TANF funds each state gives as cash benefits directly to lowest-income families. That number tends to be lower in abortion-restrictive states. Research associate Diana Azevedo-McCaffrey tells NPR over email that some states, especially those that spend less on basic assistance, use a sizable amount of TANF funds on \"other areas,\" including after-school programs, youth and children services and short-term benefits to help families in crisis situations. \"While these are worthy and important investments, states should use funding sources other than federal and state TANF funds for them \u2014 particularly when states spend so little on providing cash assistance and supporting work for families with the lowest incomes,\" Azevedo-McCaffrey added. Fifteen states spent 10% or less of their TANF funds on basic assistance in 2020, the Center found. Six of them (Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri and Texas) have banned abortions, while two others (Indiana and North Dakota) have bans pending. \"Cash assistance almost might as well not exist in some of these states, it is so hard to access,\" Lower-Basch adds. She said in states with such low benefit levels, and so many hoops to jump through, people may decide it's not worth the effort or insult to their dignity to apply in the first place. Some require people to apply to a certain number of jobs before considering their applications, and Lower-Basch notes that in today's economy, someone can find a job during that process and no longer be eligible for TANF, even if their salary is low. And making a low salary is not an unlikely scenario, especially in restrictive states. Only eight of the 24 states that have banned or are likely to ban abortion have minimum wages above the federal level of $7.25 per hour, Lower-Basch says. She also notes that none of the states that have banned abortion have paid family and medical leave programs \u2014 only 11 states and Washington, D.C., do. In fact, North Dakota passed a law last year banning cities and counties from enacting local paid family leave laws. Lawmakers in the abortion ban states of Oklahoma and Tennessee have introduced \u2014 but not passed \u2014 such legislation. Lack of paid leave can pose a sizable problem for working parents, especially if they need to find and pay for childcare for their kids not yet in school. Six states have no publicly funded prekindergarten programs at all \u2014 including Idaho, Indiana, South Dakota and Wyoming, which have either banned or moved to ban abortion. Lower-Basch says that while the trends are \"most glaring\" in certain states, the U.S. as a whole is not doing enough to support families with children. A voter casts a ballot in the Kansas primary on August 2, when Kansans voted resoundingly to keep abortion legal.\n                \n                    \n                    Kyle Rivas/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption A voter casts a ballot in the Kansas primary on August 2, when Kansans voted resoundingly to keep abortion legal. The data doesn't look promising for people forced to carry unwanted pregnancies in abortion-restrictive states. So what options do they have, and what can lawmakers and reproductive rights advocates do? Lower-Basch says there is very little evidence that people are moving to states to get better economic benefits and opportunities, particularly if they want to stay close to family or don't have the money or resources to move. Zephyrin of the Commonwealth Fund agrees, noting that the most marginalized groups are those that will feel the effects of abortion bans the hardest. \"We're assuming that people that are most affected have the resources \u2014 the time, money \u2014 to be able to up and travel to another state, and I don't think that's a realistic or fair expectation,\" she says. \"There's also an importance to think bottom-up in terms of what are ways to get resources to people, to communities on the ground so that some of these impacts can be mitigated.\" That work can include helping people access abortion funds to have more decision-making power over their own bodies, as well as investing in community organizations and health care infrastructure on the ground. There are also top-down solutions, like conducting research and changing policies. There's also voting, Lower-Basch adds, noting that many of these states are \"not as red as their legislatures\" in part due to gerrymandering and voter suppression. Abortion is shaping up to be a major issue this midterm election season. Kansans recently voted resoundingly to keep abortion legal, but lawmakers elsewhere have campaigned on the false notion that Democrats support abortion until the moment of birth. Zephyrin stresses the need for urgency. \"We can't sit in our doom and gloom while people are just experiencing these inequitable outcomes,\" she says. \"We have to act, and we have to act now.\"",

Sarah Palin greets the crowd during a rally held by former President Donald Trump on July 9 in Anchorage.\n                \n                    \n                    Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption U.S. House candidate former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin greets the crowd during a rally held by former President Donald Trump on July 9 in Anchorage. Alaskans go to the polls Tuesday to decide, among other things, whether to send former governor and Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin to Congress. The right-wing Republican is among three candidates in a special election for Alaska's sole U.S. House seat. Palin is up against Republican Nick Begich III and Democrat Mary Peltola in the first test of Alaska's new ranked-choice voting system. The winner will serve until the end of the year, finishing the term of GOP Rep. Don Young. He died in March after serving 49 years. Begich is a wealthy tech entrepreneur. He was co-chair of Young's 2020 campaign but turned on the incumbent the next year and ran to Young's right. He comes from a family of prominent Democrats and is named for his grandfather, the congressman who held the seat before Young. With two conservatives splitting the vote, Peltola, a salmon advocate and former state legislator from western Alaska, is likely to gain the most first-choice ballots. But the winner of the special election won't be known until the end of August, after all the mailed ballots arrive. That's when the Alaska Division of Elections will tabulate the rankings. The third-place finisher will be eliminated and the ballots that went to the candidate will be reallocated according to the voters' second choices. Palin has called it the \"screwiest system\" that \"makes no sense to most voters.\" A slim majority of Alaska voters adopted the new method in 2020. It pairs a nonpartisan primary with ranked choice voting in the general. To win the special general, one of the conservatives would have to get enough second-choice votes from the other to overcome Peltola's likely lead in the first round of counting. The two Republicans have been attacking each other for weeks while leaving Peltola alone. Palin recently called the Democrat a \"sweetheart,\" even as she attacks Begich for supporting Democrats in past races. Begich has called Palin a \"quitter,\" tapping into the disappointment many Alaska Republicans felt when she resigned as governor in 2009 in the wake of her unsuccessful campaign as John McCain's vice presidential running mate in 2008. \"We picked her to do a job, and she didn't bother to finish it. Because she wanted to go out there and get rich and famous,\" a Begich ad says. While they need second-choice votes, Begich and Palin have a more immediate concern. \"Game No. 1 has to be that you don't come in third,\" said Art Hackney, a Republican consultant working for Begich. \"Because if you come in third, you are, you know, moot to the whole thing, and it becomes your second-choice votes that are the things that matter.\" To complicate this election day for voters, it is also the day of the regular primary. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, a moderate Republican who supports abortion rights, is on the ballot for reelection with 18 challengers. Among them is attorney and evangelical pastor Kelly Tshibaka. She, like Palin, has the endorsement of former President Donald Trump. The Alaska Republican Party would like to punish Murkowski for voting to convict Trump at his second impeachment trial, but the new system eliminates the partisan primary. The top four vote-getters will advance to the November ballot. Murkowski and Tshibaka are both sure to make the cut, along with Democrat Pat Chesbro, a retired educator. Also at stake this election season: Who will serve the next full term in the U.S. House. Begich, Palin and Peltola are all in that race, too.",

            "article_content": "Trump-endorsed candidates have done well in key party primaries so far, but they may prove to be too extreme when they come before the general electorate this fall.  DANIEL ESTRIN, HOST: Republicans endorsed by former President Donald Trump have won key primaries for governor and the U.S. Senate so far this year. But in some instances, those candidates may turn out to fare worse in the general elections in November and hamper GOP hopes for a big sweep in the midterms. NPR's Don Gonyea reports. DON GONYEA, BYLINE: Let's start in Arizona, where Trump endorsed a slate of candidates for top statewide offices, all of whom falsely say the 2020 election was stolen. All four won in the primary. Here's gubernatorial nominee Kari Lake at a recent Trump rally. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KARI LAKE: We will no longer accept corruptness. And I know for a fact we will no longer accept rigged elections. Who's with me on that? (CHEERING) GONYEA: A large majority of Republicans in Arizona say they believe fraud cost Donald Trump re-election, but it's a minority view across the whole electorate. In Michigan, Republican nominee for governor Tudor Dixon has also falsely claimed there was widespread fraud in the 2020 presidential result. That puts her out of step with Michigan voters overall, same with her position on abortion rights. Abortion is now a top issue thanks to a Supreme Court remade by President Trump and reinforced by this month's ballot vote in Kansas. In Michigan, a referendum appears headed to the November ballot that could create a constitutional right to an abortion in the state. John Sellek, a GOP consultant in Michigan, says interest in the referendum is through the roof. JOHN SELLEK: And the Democrats are counting on this to motivate a lot of votes to come their way. So they plan to use the abortion issue front and center to draw independent and soft Republican, especially females, on to the Dems' side. GONYEA: Sellek says the task for GOP candidates is to convince moderate and independent voters who support the referendum to still cast votes for Republicans based on things like inflation and disapproval of President Biden. Still, it's hard to predict abortion's impact come November. Political scientist David Cohen at the University of Akron says what is clear so far is that Trump remains a political force in primaries. DAVID COHEN: There's a level of enthusiasm for him still within the party, even with being impeached twice, even with him losing the election. GONYEA: But after the primaries comes the challenge of translating the boost from Trump into general election votes. We can already see some Republican Senate nominees struggling with that. Each is a political novice chosen by Trump for both their loyalty and their celebrity. In Pennsylvania, it's Mehmet Oz, famous as TV's Dr. Oz, who trails his Democratic opponent in polls and fundraising. In Ohio, \"Hillbilly Elegy\" author J.D. Vance is in a tighter than expected race. And in Georgia, former football star Herschel Walker has struggled to show any command of the issues. Again, David Cohen. COHEN: In the general election, you have to appeal to a much wider swath of people. Just because Trump is very influential in the primaries doesn't mean this influence is going to carry over into the November general election. GONYEA: It is still predicted to be a difficult election year for Democrats, given historical trends of a rough midterm for the party of a first-term president. That said, candidates running in the Trump mold have nonetheless provided Democrats an opening in some key races. Don Gonyea, NPR News. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.

For the better part of a year, Democratic divisions have been a dominant storyline. Moderates and progressives couldn't come up with a deal on President Joe Biden's legislative agenda, West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin was the poster child for progressive anger and Biden was struggling with the base and suffering politically because of it. But that picture has started to change. The House passed a significant piece of legislation Friday and sent it to Biden to sign into law. The Senate, with the help of Manchin, passed it over the weekend. It marks a few weeks of legislative successes for Democrats, as the primary season starts to turn to general elections for these midterms. It includes: The legislation, while less than Biden originally proposed or progressives wanted, is a big win for the White House and the party. \"Teddy Roosevelt got his Square Deal, FDR got his New Deal, Truman got the Fair Deal. I'd call this Biden's good deal,\" said Joel Payne, a Democratic strategist and former leadership aide to the late Democratic Senate Leader Harry Reid. \"This is a good deal for President Biden and for Democrats. And it's something that they can talk about over the next few weeks.\" One piece of legislation won't solve all of Democrats' (or Biden's) problems. They still face the headwinds of a president's first midterm, Biden's unpopularity, inflation that's at a four-decade high and gas prices, though they have come down of late, are still higher than most struggling to pay bills would like. The bill is even named the Inflation Reduction Act. Though the legislation's effect on inflation may be negligible, according to the Congressional Budget Office, it's a clear sign that Democrats see the threat of what Americans are saying is their top concern. But Democratic strategists say it's a start. \"It gives you something to run on,\" said Jon Kott, a former senior adviser to Manchin. He noted that Democrats' inability to pass legislation at the end of last year made it harder for the party to mount a strong message in the campaign for Virginia governor, for example. \"You want to run on your record when you're in office,\" Kott said, \"and you want to go there and say, 'I did this. I helped you get this. I made your life better through this piece of legislation.' \" It also adds to the momentum Democrats have been building for the last few months, said Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist Institute for Public Opinion, which conducts polling for NPR. \"If you start connecting all the dots,\" he said, \"everything is going the Democrats' way at this point, given that not too long ago, nothing was going their way.\" In addition to passing the most recent legislation, Miringoff pointed to the Jan. 6 committee hearings that have dented former President Donald Trump with his base and that there's been a marked jump in Democratic enthusiasm after the Supreme Court's conservative majority overturned Roe v. Wade. The intensity around the issue of abortion led to the major victory for abortion-rights supporters on a ballot measure in Kansas last week. It is raising eyebrows for Republicans and is giving Democrats hope that they can stem what could have been a red wave in the House \u2013 and potentially hold the Senate. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the group tasked with trying to help Democratic candidates win House seats, says its data show the Supreme Court's opinion overturning Roe and tying it to Republicans has proven to be the \"top testing negative\" attack in competitive districts. The DCCC has also launched multimillion-dollar ad campaigns to try and mobilize voters around the issue. Strategists still expect Republicans to win control of the House, given gerrymandering, historic precedent and the narrow five-seat majority Democrats are clinging to. But keeping the margins down is hugely important for any party to live to fight another cycle. What's more, Democratic candidates are outpacing Biden's approval rating in the generic congressional ballot test, a question that asks if voters could cast a ballot today, would they vote for a generic Republican or Democrat. The more favorable landscape to Democrats \u2013 and some hard-right Republicans running in a handful of key states \u2013 may wind up having the most notable effect in Senate races. Democratic candidates are holding up well in states that are expected to be close, according to public and private surveys, as well as reporting with campaigns. President Joe Biden and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi listen as Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer speaks before Biden signs the CHIPS bill on Aug. 9, 2022.\n                \n                    \n                    Evan Vucci/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption President Joe Biden and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi listen as Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer speaks before Biden signs the CHIPS bill on Aug. 9, 2022. \"Democrats seem to be in far better shape than they ever could have imagined possible,\" Miringoff said. \"It doesn't mean they're going to rack up big victories, but if they hold where they are right now and win a seat or two in the Senate, they would have easily bargained for that six months ago.\" But to get over the finish line, Democrats need their base to be fully on board. Many progressives had been deeply disappointed with Biden for not fighting more boldly and not delivering on campaign promises, like major climate initiatives and student loans. Whether the left interprets this latest piece of legislation as a major victory and goes to the polls could be the difference between Democrats mitigating damage in the House and holding the Senate \u2013 or not. \"You have to take yes for an answer sometimes,\" Kott said. \"And I don't think either side gets everything they want. But I think if you get 70% of what you want, that's pretty good. And you should be happy with that.\" This summer has found Biden handed a string of bipartisan legislative victories, from addressing gun violence, billions for incentivizing the semiconductor production in the U.S. and, now, this current legislation. Each of those victories came, ironically, with Biden, the former longtime senator, being what Payne called a \"bystander president.\" \"The reason why the bystander approach worked in these last few weeks is because the other players stepped up,\" Payne said. When a president isn't involved and things don't get done, though, he said, it can be \"very frustrating to parts of your coalition.\" That's why it's critical, Payne said, to \"get the politics of it right.\" And that means a president and White House doing a good job telling the story of what it has accomplished. \"I think that's something that maybe the president and his team and his allies have struggled with,\" Payne said. \"And I think what you're hoping now is that there's a more complete story to tell, that that is now something that can land better with members of his coalition.\"",

In 2004, Michels ran for U.S. Senate, winning a GOP primary but losing the general election to former Democratic U.S. Sen. Russ Feingold. After the backing of the former president in this race, Michels shot up in the polls and ran a competitive campaign against Rebecca Kleefisch, who was lieutenant governor under former Republican Gov. Scott Walker for eight years. Kleefisch was also supported by former Vice President Mike Pence. Michels hasn't gone as far as Trump when it comes to the way he describes the 2020 presidential election, but he has cast doubt on President Biden's victory in Wisconsin, which was affirmed by a statewide canvas, a partial recount and multiple state and federal court decisions. When asked at a recent debate whether he'd sign legislation that would \"decertify\" Biden's 2020 victory in Wisconsin, Michels kept his options open. In 2018, Democratic Gov. Tony Evers won the election for governor by a sliver and the race in 2022 between Michels and Evers could be just as close. The governor has incumbency and a decent approval rating on his side. Evers is regularly at odds with Republicans in the state and has set veto records. In many ways, his veto is the only thing standing in between the large GOP majorities in the legislature and measures like making it easier to carry concealed guns and election law changes that would likely become law under Michels. To many in Wisconsin, Michels policy agenda is a mystery. While he's laid out some of what he'd prioritize if elected, big questions remain about how he would govern. But the spotlight of the campaign has prompted Michels to take stands on some issues. In early July, his campaign didn't respond when asked by the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel whether he would ban emergency contraceptives, known as Plan B. By mid-month, he told reporters he would not. \"I am against abortion,\" Michels said. \"I am not against contraception.\" Michels' stump speech lists three priorities as governor. He tells voters he's for \"election integrity,\" referencing a package of changes that includes eliminating the Wisconsin Elections Commission. He said he also wants to reduce crime and reform education.",

            "article_content": "Ron DeSantis, seen speaking to reporters from Fox News in 2018 when he was running for governor of Florida, has been prominent in a recent trend of Republicans ignoring or actively avoiding mainstream press, particularly national outlets.\n                \n                    \n                    John Raoux/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Ron DeSantis, seen speaking to reporters from Fox News in 2018 when he was running for governor of Florida, has been prominent in a recent trend of Republicans ignoring or actively avoiding mainstream press, particularly national outlets. I went to Wisconsin in June to report on how abortion rights are affecting the Senate and governor primaries \u2013 the idea was to do one story on the Democrats and one on the Republicans. Long story short: I heard back from the Democrats but not the Republicans. Phone calls, emails, Facebook messages \u2013 I didn't hear back from anyone. The top Republican governor candidates posted no events, though their social media showed they were out, talking to voters. And so, when I happened to catch the top two GOP governor candidates walking in an Oconomowoc Fourth of July parade, I ran to the end of the route to catch them. I found former Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch greeting supporters. A staffer who then stepped between us told me they knew I had been reaching out and that I should contact a communications staffer, to whom I had already reached out. He would get back to me, she assured me. He did not. And a day later, at a publicly-advertised meet-and-greet for governor candidate Kevin Nicholson, a staffer told me I wouldn't be allowed to even get tape of Nicholson greeting attendees. As standalone anecdotes, these might not be a huge deal. However, they are also a part of a trend of Republican candidates ignoring or actively avoiding legacy media \u2014 particularly national outlets. The phenomenon is impossible to quantify, but many Republican candidates are showing that they don't want \u2013 or need \u2013 to get their messages out via legacy media outlets. That can reduce the scrutiny they face while running for public office, hampering voters' ability to make informed choices. A large group of reporters was kept out of a rally this spring for Republican gubernatorial candidate Doug Mastriano in Pennsylvania. CBS's Robert Costa confronted a man who was blocking press from entry. \"If you're with the campaign, we can have a dialogue,\" Costa said. \"No dialogue,\" the man responded. Here\u2019s video of the guy refusing to answer @costareports questions about who from the Mastriano campaign has authorized blocking press. pic.twitter.com/V6XXbsCYr2 In addition, reporters have been frustrated by getting extremely limited access to other Republicans running for public office, like Georgia Senate candidate Herschel Walker, and Alaska congressional candidate Sarah Palin. And the Republican National Committee voted unanimously this year to withdraw from the Commission on Presidential Debates ahead of 2024. Chair Ronna McDaniel said the party would find other platforms for debating. Recently, the Florida GOP allowed conservative outlets into the party's Sunshine Summit, but barred many mainstream reporters, including Dave Weigel, author of the Washington Post's campaign newsletter, \"The Trailer.\" \"You have one person from the campaign tweeting a photo from inside the room and talking about how great the view is that the journalists can't see,\" he said. \"Spokespeople who are not answering my basic questions, like, 'Is there a recording of this event?' are taking the time to make fun of reporters for going there.\" Indeed, Gov. Ron DeSantis' spokeswoman Christina Pushaw taunted reporters on Twitter afterward. \"It has come to my attention that some liberal media activists are mad because they aren't allowed into #SunshineSummit this weekend,\" she wrote. \"My message to them is to try crying about it.\" It has come to my attention that some liberal media activists are mad because they aren't allowed into #SunshineSummit this weekend. My message to them is to try crying about it. Then go to kickboxing and have a margarita. And write the same hit piece you were gonna write anyway. DeSantis also held a ceremony to sign a bill into law last year that aired exclusively on Fox News with no access for other media. It is entirely true that Democratic candidates also dodge questions and have private events. It's also true that GOP distrust of media is decades old. Vice President Spiro Agnew, for example, famously lambasted media coverage of Richard Nixon in 1969. But to Weigel, it's different this year on the Republican side. \"In this cycle, I've started to see more Republican candidates avoiding the press, blocking the press from events, and taking advantage of the fact that there is conservative media that will ask different questions and has a different audience,\" he said. \"And to be honest, an interview with one of those websites might get more views from the people who vote in a Republican primary than interview with me.\" \"So I'm obviously not saying to the world, 'Stop talking to the media,'\" he added. \"I'm saying, just objectively, there is a media infrastructure built up so that you don't need, if you're a Republican candidate, to talk to us.\" In other words, this is the outcome of a long-growing conservative media ecosystem. As the Republican base increasingly gets their news primarily from right-leaning news outlets they agree with, Republican candidates will increasingly grant access primarily to friendly right-leaning news outlets, meaning there are fewer and fewer outlets who can provide a broad view of what's going on in American politics. Scott Jennings, a Republican strategist and CNN commentator, agrees and says that in deciding whether to do an interview, there's always a cost/benefit analysis. And what is the benefit, he asked, of doing a potentially adversarial interview with an outlet you think is biased anyway? \"The risk of submitting yourself to what the campaign would consider to be risky questioning \u2014 the possibility that you might end up saying something that winds up in $10 million worth of ads from the other side \u2014 it's like the benefit of doing the interview does not outweigh the risk,\" he said. \"And so you just don't do it.\" And in this cycle, avoiding some interviews can mean avoiding any number of tough questions \u2013 about Jan. 6, abortion or same-sex marriage, for example. In addition to using right-wing media, campaigns can also now connect with their supporters without media middlemen at all, Jennings added. \"When I started 20 years ago, you know, you spent a good chunk of every day on campaigns trying to figure out how to get the media to cover whatever you're doing that day,\" he said. \"But now, you don't need an intermediary to connect with your supporters any more than you can connect with your most fervent supporters directly via social media, and campaign email lists, and so on and so forth.\" It's certainly not only Republicans who have discovered this; after having a stroke, Pennsylvania Democratic Senate candidate John Fetterman largely stayed away from interviews and events for weeks, gaining attention instead in ongoing meme wars with Republican candidate Mehmet Oz. And this did mean that, for a period, the public couldn't be clear on Fetterman's health status. But there is a big difference between this instance and a broader campaign of delegitimizing media, says Kathleen Hall Jamieson, professor of communication at the University of Pennsylvania. \"There's a difference between hunkering down but hoping that all of the available media will cover you, and planning a strategy which deliberately says you can't trust those other media venues,\" she said. \"You can't trust those venues\" is a long-standing argument from the Republican side \u2014 that legacy media has a liberal bias. Trust numbers reflect this belief \u2014 just 11% of Republicans trust the mass media, compared to nearly 7 in 10 Democrats, according to Gallup. The question of liberal bias isn't something we can settle in a small section of one article, and coming from a legacy media outlet, a claim that we aim to be unbiased would inevitably come off to some as...well...biased. But it is also nevertheless true that claims of liberal bias are themselves a political tactic. Which leads to one more factor contributing to hostility toward reporters: Donald Trump, who infamously called the press \"the enemy of the people.\" Then-President Donald Trump points to journalist Jim Acosta from CNN during a post-election press conference in the East Room of the White House in Washington, DC on Nov. 7, 2018. During the exchange, Trump called the reporter \"a rude, terrible person\" and later suspended his access to the White House.\n                \n                    \n                    JIM WATSON/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Then-President Donald Trump points to journalist Jim Acosta from CNN during a post-election press conference in the East Room of the White House in Washington, DC on Nov. 7, 2018. During the exchange, Trump called the reporter \"a rude, terrible person\" and later suspended his access to the White House. And now, that hostility is an overt part of other Republicans' identities. \"In the old days, your assumption would be, if a national newspaper is putting a negative story out there, we have to engage with it because we've got to get our side of the story in and make sure it's not a one-sided deal,\" said Jennings. \"Now, I think it's actually different in that you might engage, but you might also make the determination that if you're a Republican, well, if The New York Times runs a hit piece on me, that's a badge of honor.\" Mainstream news also doesn't have the broad reach it once did. If, say, the national evening news is losing eyes and ears to right-wing outlets, there's less reason for candidates to respond. It's not every candidate, and they're not avoiding every mainstream outlet. Many candidates are more likely to be friendly to local than national press, says Mark Harris, a Pennsylvania-based Republican strategist. \u200b\"The best thing you can still do is get a 6 o'clock local NBC, ABC, CBS TV news hit,\" Harris said. \"Local TV is number 1 and local print is number 2.\" NPR contacted several political reporters from around the country and found a range of experiences. One in Texas reported nothing out of the ordinary this year. A political reporter in Iowa said they're seeing some evidence of Republicans avoiding scrutiny \u2014 Republicans are far outnumbered at a popular candidate forum at the Iowa State Fair, for example. That's important because scrutiny from local press can often get at issues more immediate to voters' lives. Alex Burness, who recently left the Denver Post, said he sees a definite partisan difference. \"I have seen it on both sides. It is coming much more often from Republicans,\" he said, pointing to a recent campaign event for GOP gubernatorial candidate Heidi Ganahl. \"Colorado's gubernatorial nominee on the Republican side held an event to announce \u2014 to appear publicly for the first time with her [lieutenant governor] pick, who is an election denier,\" he said. \"They said at the onset, 'We're not taking any questions.' And we in the little media area had a conversation before she went on. We're like, 'Well, why are we here? We're not here to give PR.'\" And those kinds of questions are important to ask, says Khadijah Costley White, a professor of media studies at Rutgers University. Rather than scrambling for access to events, she said, reporters need to think harder \u2014 in an atmosphere of constant disinformation \u2014 about what access will achieve. \"Is it important to have voices regardless of what they say, regardless of whether or not they're using that opportunity as a way to distribute disinformation or misinformation?\" she asked. \"Is that valuable to democracy?\" All of this may come off as a lament that some GOP candidates are making reporters' lives harder. That is certainly the read of people like Ron DeSantis' spokesperson when she tells reporters to \"cry about it.\" But as more candidates have ostensibly public events and don't allow people to tell the public what is said at those events, it raises concerns about accountability. \"I'm a Republican communications guy and engage with the traditional media and I'm on CNN,\" Jennings said. \"So I say this with all sincerity: We have to have a trusted press. It's necessary to democracy.\" However, candidates aren't incentivized to talk to the press for democracy's sake; they talk because it serves their interests. The question is where all this leads.\u200b \"I'm not saying, 'How dare they do this?' I'm interested in where this is going,\" Weigel said. \"If we're returning to the days when Democrats have one newspaper or Republicans have another newspaper, we might not like that, but there's precedent for it.\" At any rate \u2014 I never did do that piece on Wisconsin Republicans. I simply didn't have enough people to talk to me. If that's true for enough outlets, it means uneven coverage of the two parties and an electorate that has to work ever-harder to be fully informed.

AILSA CHANG, HOST: For decades, conservatives have perceived the mainstream press as biased against them.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: But still, it's a private event. KURTZLEBEN: It's not. UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #2: It's a public campaign rally. UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #1: For public office. KURTZLEBEN: It's a public event. Recently, the Florida GOP barred many mainstream outlets from the party's Sunshine Summit but allowed in conservative outlets.

They were watching election results at the Kansas for Constitutional Freedom watch party in Overland Park. Tuesday was the biggest primary day left on the 2022 midterm calendar \u2014 and there were some telling results that could have implications for this fall, from the state of abortion rights in this country to the risks to Republicans and Democrats posed by former President Donald Trump's influence. Here are four takeaways from the results in Arizona, Kansas, Michigan, Missouri and Washington state: Voters in Kansas rejected a ballot initiative that would have opened the door to allowing lawmakers to significantly restrict abortion rights in the state. But it didn't just fail, it failed decisively. It's the first time voters have weighed in on the issue since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, and it has to be an eye-opener for Republicans. This is conservative Kansas, not New York or California. And it was on the ballot in August because abortion-rights opponents thought it would advantage them with a low-turnout election. But it was no low-turnout affair. For context, in 2018, only about 450,000 people turned out for the Kansas primary elections. For this ballot measure, it was double. That's about half of Kansas' total registered voters. For a ballot measure in August... wow. Republican strategists over these last few months have been concerned about how the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe would affect the campaigns. This is going to make them raise some eyebrows with their morning coffee, because this result clearly shows where the energy is on the issue of abortion rights right now. Now, this was a one-issue race in Kansas, and moderate voters and independents have been saying inflation, gas prices and crime are more important to their vote this fall. But abortion rights has skyrocketed up the list of concerns and engaged a Democratic base that was otherwise depressed. Republicans were on a glide path to take back the House and potentially the Senate, but abortion-rights supporters now have the potential to help Democrats blunt some of those expected GOP gains in the House and hold the Senate. In Arizona's key Senate race, Blake Masters won with Trump's endorsement and will face the more moderate Democrat Mark Kelly this fall. Masters is a venture capitalist who has pushed Trump's policies and his election lies. Masters \u2014 who had big financial backing from his friend and mentor, PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, who poured millions into this race to boost Masters \u2014 has said for example, that Democrats \"pulled out all the stops\" to steal the 2020 presidential election and has suggested this year's midterms might not be on the level. In the secretary of state's race, a Trump-backed conspiracy theorist and election denier, Mark Finchem, who was on the Capitol grounds on Jan. 6, won the GOP nomination. Finchem is now the sixth election denier across the country to win the Republican nomination for the job that often controls election administration in the states. Four of those places are key presidential swing states \u2014 Michigan, Nevada, New Mexico and, now, Arizona. The big race for Arizona governor between Trump's preferred candidate, Kari Lake, and Karrin Taylor Robson \u2014 who had the backing of former Vice President Mike Pence and outgoing Gov. Doug Ducey \u2014 was still too close to call on Wednesday morning. Polls had shown Lake, also an election denier, ahead, but Lake only leads by a couple thousand votes. In the Missouri Senate race, state Attorney General Eric Schmitt handily defeated the controversial former Gov. Eric Greitens. The day before this race, Trump endorsed \"ERIC.\" Just \"ERIC,\" no last name. That doesn't count for much except trolling. In Michigan, Trump got a win with his candidate, John Gibbs, ousting Peter Meijer, one of the 10 Republicans who voted for his impeachment following his conduct on and before the Jan. 6 insurrection. Democrats boosted Gibbs, spending millions to help oust Meijer, thinking it would give them a better shot at winning the seat in a general election. It's a Machiavellian move that's part of a larger trend for Democrats in these kinds of races and has irritated even some Democratic lawmakers. It worked in the short term in this race, but, if Gibbs \u2014 and other candidates like him \u2014 wins, it would come back to bite Democrats (more on that below). Two other Republican Trump impeachers were also on the ballot in Washington state, Reps. Jaime Herrera Beutler and Dan Newhouse. The races have not been called, as only about half the vote was in by Wednesday morning. Both incumbents lead Republican challengers narrowly in primaries where the top two candidates, regardless of party, move on to the general election. If they hold on, they would join California's David Valadao as the only Trump impeachers left standing. Four others announced their decision not to run for reelection, and Jan. 6 committee vice chair and principal Trump antagonist Liz Cheney faces her fate in two weeks in Wyoming. And Cheney is in a lot of trouble. The latest NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll found that just 13% of Republicans nationally had a favorable view of her, as compared to 60% of Democrats. That's a tough position in a very conservative state, where Republicans outnumber Democrats five-to-one and that went more heavily for Trump than any other state in 2020. Cheney has been trying to appeal to Democrats in her state, but that is unlikely to work. Why? Let's put it this way: She could win every single non-Republican voter in the state \u2014 Democrats, independents, libertarians, Constitution Party members and otherwise unaffiliated voters, and she could still lose by almost 50 points. That's a lot of ground to make up with Republicans. Sure, Trump took out Meijer. But it's a district President Biden won by double-digits in 2020, and with the hard-line Gibbs, a Trump Housing and Urban Development appointee, on the ballot, it gives Democrats a key pickup opportunity. In fact, shortly after the race was called, the Cook Political Report changed the race from Toss Up to Lean Democrat. Sure, Masters won in the Arizona Senate race, but can someone peddling Trump's election lies and who supports Trump's hard-right policies in the ever-more-purple Arizona beat a more moderate candidate like Kelly? Do these election deniers in secretary of state races win in states Democrats have won in the last several presidential elections when those positions have traditionally gone to fairly nonpartisan people? That's really important, because, as the Jan. 6 hearings have shown, democracy held in 2020, but only because of people who did the right thing. If these candidates do win, though \u2014 and it's possible given anyone with a \"D\" or \"R\" next to their name in these highly polarized times starts at about 45% in a competitive race \u2014 and Trump runs and wins in 2024, he will be in a much stronger position to impose his will than in 2017 when he first took office or in 2021 when he left. He would control a lot more levers in states, from state parties to elections officials. And those seeds are being sown, as Biden is at his lowest point of popularity, largely because independents concerned with inflation and high gas prices are heavily disapproving of the job he's doing, while Democrats, notably progressives, are disappointed Biden hasn't been able to get more done for them or fight as boldly as they'd like. But come 2024, Trump could pose an emboldened threat to infighting Democrats \u2014 and if Biden runs, as he says he will, his challenge is to get his base back on board to stand up to it.",

Friday, Dixon received a late endorsement from former President Donald Trump. Previously, she also racked up endorsements from well-known names in Michigan politics, like the family of former U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos. Dixon is fervently against abortion rights and made recent headlines after responding to a question about the hypothetical rape of a 14-year-old by a family member being a \"perfect example\" of why abortion should be banned. Before that, Dixon had made schools and education central issues for her campaign. She has also heavily criticized incumbent Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's early COVID-19-pandemic lockdown policies. Lately, Dixon has seen attacks directed at her from both sides of the aisle. Her Republican challengers had pushed back on her support from the DeVos family and other political insiders. Meanwhile, the Democratic Governors Association has also run attack ads against Dixon, with a recent $2 million campaign against her. Dixon is a businesswoman and a former conservative media host and will go on to face incumbent Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a well-funded Democrat.",

PHOENIX \u2014 There is a lot of confusion around what is legal in Arizona when it comes to abortion after Roe v. Wade. Arizona has an abortion law dating back to the 1800s, decades before it became a state. A debate around that law has moved the race for state attorney general into the spotlight. That law outlaws abortions with very few exceptions, and it has never been repealed. But the state also has a number of more recent laws that restrict abortion in various other ways. For example, the state's legislature this year passed a law banning abortion after 15 weeks of gestation. So the question is, which laws are providers supposed to follow? Arizona's current state attorney general, Republican Mark Brnovich, says the old ban from territorial days is enforceable. But Brnovich is at the end of his term, so both sides of the issue now are really focused on who will replace him and what the next AG's interpretation of Arizona's law will be. On the Republican side, there are six candidates and they've all indicated that they would plan to enforce state laws that restrict abortion. On the Democrat side, there's only one candidate running unopposed who says any limits on abortion in Arizona are in violation of the state constitution, which guarantees an individual's right to privacy. For now, most abortions have already stopped in Arizona. Brnovich is seeking to enforce the state's 19th-century ban. While the issue is stalled in court, Planned Parenthood and other providers don't want to take a risk while the law is still unclear. Already there are reports of California clinics getting a big influx of Arizona patients.",

Laura Kelly speaks during a news conference, Thursday, Jan. 6, 2022, at the Statehouse in Topeka, Kan. Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly, the incumbent Democrat who won in 2018 with 48% of the vote, is expected to win her primary on Tuesday against Democrat Richard Karnowski, but the November election could be a different story. The race for governor is considered a tossup, according to the non-partisan Cook Political Report. Kelly lost favorability among Republicans during the pandemic for enforcing COVID-19 health restrictions. Her expected rival is Kansas Attorney General Derek Schmidt. His primary rival Tuesday is Arlyn Briggs. Schmidt has served as the attorney general in Kansas since 2010 and is endorsed by former President Donald Trump. Schmidt promoted Trump's false claims about the 2020 election, including joining a lawsuit that challenged the legitimacy of President Biden's win. The U.S. Supreme Court dismissed that lawsuit in Dec. 2020. When it comes to abortion, Schmidt has been criticized for a legal opinion he released on the constitutional amendment before voters Tuesday. Schmidt backs the amendment, which would explicitly say the state constitution does not protect the right to an abortion. Critics say his opinion, which contended the change to the Kansas Constitution would not restrict treatments for medically dangerous pregnancies, was a ploy intended to bolster the chances of passing a change to the state constitution. Kelly, on the other hand, is adamantly pro-abortion rights. \"My position on reproductive rights has been clear from the get-go, from the moment I walked onto the Senate floor,\" Kelly has said. \"I really do believe this is a decision that should be left to a woman and her physician, and not involve politicians.\" Republican state Sen. Dennis Pyle submitted signatures this week that, if certified, would put him on the November ballot as an independent candidate for governor. He's a conservative Republican and could, conceivably, siphon off some votes from Schmidt. KMUW's Rose Conlon and Scott Canon of the Kansas News Service contributed to this post.",

LAWRENCE, Kan. \u2014 Today, voters in Kansas will decide whether their state constitution should not explicitly protect abortion. Protesters against the amendment have taken to the streets, while rallies in support are taking place in church sanctuaries. It's also spurred millions of dollars of campaign funding to flood into the state from across the country. See more live Kansas election results here. Supporters say the amendment does not ban abortion. They argue it would correct what they see as the state court's overreach by striking down some of the state's previous abortion restrictions. For example, a law struck down in December that mandated specific health inspections for abortion providers could kick in if voters tweak the state constitution next week. As the state hurtles toward the vote, the campaign arguments have been contentious, and the vote appears to be close. \"At the end of the day, the vast majority of Kansans, they are with us,\" said Mercedes Schlapp during a recent rally at Central Christian Church in Wichita. Schlapp's husband, Matt Schlapp is the chairman of the American Conservative union. They argued the vote simply puts abortion policymaking back in the hands of lawmakers. \"They understand the importance of this amendment to protect the woman and protect our unborn babies.\" But at least some polling doesn't support that. According to a 2021 Kansas Speaks survey by Fort Hays State University, most Kansans support at least some access to abortion services. Alesha Doan, an abortion policy expert at the University of Kansas, says work by abortion opponents over the last 30 years has had one goal in mind \u2014 a full-blown abortion ban in Kansas. Protests have popped up even in some of the most conservative communities in the western part of the state \u2014 Hays, Dodge City and Garden City.",

Up until Monday in Michigan, the line on abortion rights was clear. The state has a 1931 law that criminalizes abortion that was dormant during Roe v. Wade. In May, a month before the Dobbs decision, a lower court in the state put an injunction on the 1931 law, so it wasn't in effect when the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. Monday, the Michigan Court of Appeals issued a ruling saying that injunction does not apply to county prosecutors \u2013 so they could enforce the 1931 abortion ban. But because the decision appears to not take effect for 21 days, it allows time for appeals to be filed. People in the state can still access abortion in the state, but it's a confusing time and some abortion providers aren't completely sure about where things stand legally. The backdrop to that Tuesday's primary for governor in Michigan where Republican candidates are fighting one another for the chance to face Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer in November. All five candidates are against abortion rights and all five support the state's 1931 law that criminalizes abortion. That includes Tudor Dixon. She was endorsed by former President Donald Trump Friday night. She was also endorsed by Right to Life of Michigan \u2013 a really big get in Michigan Republican politics. There is also a ballot campaign in Michigan to get abortion rights enshrined into the state constitution. The group backing the amendment, Reproductive Freedom for All, last month turned in a record number of signatures \u2013 more than 750,000. If that question makes it onto the November ballot, voters will of course be voting for Governor, but they would also then be voting on the future of abortion rights in Michigan.

Kansas will be the first state in the country to vote on abortion rights since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. The U.S. Supreme Court says states are free to outlaw abortion. The Kansas Supreme Court says, sure, but only if you first change the state constitution. And the legislature, dominated by conservatives against abortion rights, put an amendment to the Kansas Constitution up for a statewide vote Tuesday. That's drawn millions in campaign spending to the state and fired up forces on both sides. \"You should have the freedom to decide whatever you want for yourself,\" says Shauna Williams, a Topeka resident who recently protested outside the Kansas Statehouse to oppose the constitutional amendment. She and other protesters say that if voters choose the constitutional amendment, state lawmakers could dictate what a person does with their body while pregnant. Supporters of the change see it as a way to regulate abortion in line with how Kansans feel about abortion. Many states saw abortion restrictions go into effect immediately after the ruling. But the right to an abortion continued in Kansas because of a landmark 2019 Kansas Supreme Court decision. So the stakes were raised for the vote in Kansas, turning a philosophical question to change the state constitution into a decision that will have real-world consequences.",

LANSING, Mich. \u2014 For months, a group of Michigan Republicans has been jockeying for the chance to face Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer in November's general election, but it's been a rough time. There were once 10 candidates on the GOP side. Everyone was new to running for office. That political inexperience may have added to a significant shakeup of the field in late May. Election staff in the state say that five candidates, including some big spenders, didn't collect enough valid signatures to make the ballot. Reports showed that a group of paid petitioners working across campaigns had faked thousands of signatures on the candidate's nominating paperwork. Businesswoman Tudor Dixon, who received a late endorsement from former President Donald Trump on Friday night, saw her poll numbers climb following the petition scandal. She has also racked up endorsements from well-known names in Republican politics, like the family of former U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos and the group Right to Life of Michigan. \"You know, we've always planned to go around the state and meet people and gain support, gain supporters, and gain the resources to go out there and get our message broadcast louder,\" said Dixon after a debate last week. \"And that's what we've been doing. And I think that's what's behind it - hard work.\" Businessman Kevin Rinke has referred to Dixon as Gov. Whitmer in sheep's clothing. \"She'll say or do anything for position,\" he said of Dixon. \"I'm a guy that's running to do the right things for the people of Michigan. This is public service for me. I'm not looking for a career.\" Largely self-funded, Rinke has pitched himself as an outsider who will slash the personal income tax rate, raise literacy and focus on election integrity. \"We can move Michigan forward by putting the people first, Democrats as well as Republicans.\" Lately, Rinke and Dixon have both seen relatively strong poll numbers. Still, leading into Tuesday, polling suggests a chunk of Republican voters are still undecided. In January, chiropractor Garrett Soldano became the first Republican to file in the governor's race. He's one of the five remaining. He says he trusts the strategy that got him this far: \"We just continue to let our grassroots army do what they do best. And that's getting out there, and you have voter contacts.\" Pam Dawson, a Michgain voter, watched the Republican debate last week and said all the candidates are strong in their own ways. \"And I think they're trying to be a little bit more cautious. They want to make sure that they're going to get the one that's going to beat Whitmer,\" she said. For Dawson, that's either Soldano or real estate agent Ryan Kelley. The latter saw his name recognition spike after the FBI arrested him in June for misdemeanor charges associated with the January 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. Kelley has pleaded not guilty. The candidates \u2014 Soldano, Dixon, Rinke, Kelley and Pastor Ralph Rebandt \u2014 have all taken similar stances, like wanting to lower taxes and opposing abortion. Candidates' ability to attract independent voters will be key to winning the general election against Gov. Whitmer, says pollster Richard Czuba of the Glengariff Group. He says two issues will likely dominate: \"We have to watch how is abortion impacting the vote versus how is inflation impacting the vote. And we don't know the answer to that, yet.\" Czuba questions how prepared the slate of Republican candidates are to take on the political veteran. \"August 3, we are likely to see a Republican nominee for governor that does not have strong name ID, does not have strong organization and probably doesn't have any money left in the bank after the primary,\" Czuba says. The Democratic Governors Association has already started running attack ads in the GOP primary and Michigan Republican Party spokesperson Gustavo Portela accuses Democrats of meddling. \"They're afraid of the message, and they're afraid of the fact that people are going to have a choice this fall.\" Whoever wins the Republican nomination may have to get used to the pressure. Recent campaign finance reports show Gov. Whitmer has millions to spend. Colin Jackson is a reporter for the Michigan Public Radio Network.",

Value Them Both, an anti-abortion rights group, was rallying to amp up their door-knockers. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: All right, good morning. (CHEERING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: All right. Are we ready to win on August 2? UNIDENTIFIED CROWD: Yeah. KURTZLEBEN: For months now, Kansans have been answering the door to countless canvassers on both sides of the Value Them Both amendment. The measure centers on a 2019 Kansas Supreme Court decision saying the state constitution protects the right to terminate a pregnancy. The amendment would negate that, making explicit that abortion is not protected. Currently, the state bans most abortions after 22 weeks and imposes other rules, like a 24-hour waiting period. The amendment itself wouldn't change any laws, but it would open the door to more restrictions. Here's Neal Allen, political science professor at Wichita State University. NEAL ALLEN: I wouldn't be surprised if yes passes. There could be a total ban on abortion come February of next year, or there could be just lots and lots of stringent regulations that make it very difficult to access abortion services. KURTZLEBEN: The vote-yes side insists the amendment merely allows legislators to choose new laws. However, they have also been tight-lipped about what laws they might pursue. Nora Ley, an 18-year-old canvasser, was at the Value Them Both rally. She explained how she responds to concern from abortion rights supporters. NORA LEY: I think protecting lives and also keeping women informed and keeping them safe is just so important. And even if this were to pass, it's not going to be exactly like a total ban right away, and especially not in any situations where it could endanger a woman. KURTZLEBEN: The amendment's opponents firmly believe that if it passes, an abortion ban is coming and that it would endanger some women. Their fervor is further fueled by the overturn of Roe v. Wade. Even in this red state, the race is tight. A recent poll found a slight lead for the vote-yes side. Canvasser Chuck Cordray, who opposes the amendment, explained between houses on Saturday that for the vote-no side, energizing people to turn out is everything. CHUCK CORDRAY: The momentum is on our side. If we had another four weeks, I know we'd win. And I think we're going to win, but it'd be even more. KURTZLEBEN: Some voters he spoke to don't need a nudge, like Democrat Lauren Van Loo. LAUREN VAN LOO: Fun secret - found out I was pregnant the very week that - found out that was going to be overturned. And I said, it still affects me, even though I'm choosing to do this of my own volition. It could have been another way, and I could have had to make a different choice. KURTZLEBEN: Similarly, there's Josh Harris, who spoke outside the Johnson County elections office just after he voted yes. JOSH HARRIS: I think it should all be banned, period - no abortions. KURTZLEBEN: Like, no exceptions... HARRIS: No exceptions. KURTZLEBEN: No. Got you. HARRIS: No. God controls life. You know what? He'll deal with it. KURTZLEBEN: But also important will be some voters who have not engaged much with the issue. Mick Krebs answered the door Friday to anti-abortion rights canvassers but told them he's a no because he wants his daughters to make decisions about their own bodies. MICK KREBS: I hadn't really thought about it until this. And so I guess I really hadn't because I was kind of already on the side of, I would say, where it was, versus now it's - you got options, I guess. KURTZLEBEN: Tuesday's vote will be the first test of abortion politics in a post-Dobbs America and a sign for other states considering abortion measures.

            "article_content": "On Tuesday, Kansas voters decide whether to strip abortion rights from the state constitution, which could lead to the legislature passing a statewide abortion ban.  CHERYL CORLEY, HOST: We begin tonight's program in Kansas, the latest terrain where the battle over abortion rights is taking place. Voters there will soon cast ballots deciding whether to strip abortion rights from the state constitution. And as Dylan Lysen of the Kansas News Service reports, they could open the door for lawmakers to begin restricting it as drastically as they see fit. DYLAN LYSEN, BYLINE: The proposed state constitutional amendment could eventually lead to a statewide abortion ban. That's led some Kansans to come out in droves to oppose the ballot measure. (SOUNDBITE OF PROTEST) UNIDENTIFIED GROUP: My body, my choice. My body, my choice. LYSEN: Outside the Kansas State House in Topeka recently, hundreds of people gathered to voice that opposition. One protester, Shauna Williams of Topeka, says a vote for the amendment would let state lawmakers dictate what a pregnant person can do with their body. SHAUNA WILLIAMS: You should have the freedom to decide whatever you want for yourself. LYSEN: Meanwhile, supporters of the amendment have held rallies in church sanctuaries. During a rally at Central Christian Church in Wichita, Matt Schlapp, chairman of the American Conservative Union, and his wife, Mercedes Schlapp, campaigned for the amendment. Along with the Catholic Church-backed Value Them Both coalition, the main group supporting the amendment, the Schlapps argued the vote simply puts abortion policymaking back in the hands of lawmakers, not the courts. Here's Mercedes. MERCEDES SCHLAPP: There is a way to talk about this in a commonsense way, because at the end of the day, the vast majority of Kansas are - they're with us. They understand the importance of this amendment to protect the women and protect our unborn babies. LYSEN: That could also allow lawmakers to take away abortion access completely, but the coalition won't acknowledge that. Instead, the coalition contends the amendment is not a ban on abortion, but a way to protect regulations that were blocked by state courts, like a law that mandated specific safety inspections just for abortion providers. While on KCUR's talk show \"Up To Date,\" the spokesperson for the coalition, Danielle Underwood, would not say if she or the coalition supported new restrictions like a total ban. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DANIELLE UNDERWOOD: It doesn't really matter what my opinion is. It matters what the opinion of the people of Kansas is. LYSEN: Republican lawmakers have also been quiet on what could come next. But some said they've already drafted legislation for a full-on ban. The campaign opposing the amendment, Kansans for Constitutional Freedom, argues that shows they are trying to present an extreme decision to remove people's rights as a politically moderate choice. Ashley All, a spokesperson for the group, says Republican lawmakers want to ban abortion completely, but that's not what Kansans really want. ASHLEY ALL: There are a lot of people in the middle who, you know, may support some restrictions, but they also recognize that there are times in places where abortion is necessary. LYSEN: Kansas polling by Fort Hays State University appears to confirm that. The survey shows most Kansans support access to abortion in some cases. It's unknown, though, if a total ban is inevitable or unrealistic. Things could change depending on the general election. Democratic Governor Laura Kelly could win reelection and wield veto power, or conservatives could keep or even gain more seats in the legislature and the ability to override her. ALESHA DOAN: It has pulled our Republican state politicians far more to the right compared to where most Kansans are on that issue. LYSEN: That's Alesha Doan, an abortion policy expert at the University of Kansas. She says abortion opponents focused on electing more lawmakers who support their cause. And the proposed amendment is the result of 30 years of work by those groups pushing for the same goal - a total ban. DOAN: That's what this amendment is designed to do. And for a politician to not answer that is also disingenuous. LYSEN: Early voting on the amendment has already begun, and Election Day is Tuesday. All Kansas voters may cast a ballot regardless of their political affiliation. For NPR News, I'm Dylan Lysen in Lawrence, Kan. Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "In the Michigan GOP primary for governor, five candidates were disqualified for allegedly collecting fraudulent signatures. Another was arrested on Jan 6. charges. Now, the race is all about abortion.  JUANA SUMMERS, HOST: For months, a group of Michigan Republicans has been jockeying for the chance to face Governor Gretchen Whitmer in November's general election. From widespread scandal to the FBI arrest of a candidate, the race has seen a lot. And it all ends Tuesday with the state's primary election. Colin Jackson of the Michigan Public Radio Network has more. COLIN JACKSON, BYLINE: In January, it was chiropractor Garrett Soldano who became the first Republican to file in the governor's race. Six months later, he's among five fighting to the end. He says he trusts the strategy that got him this far. GARRETT SOLDANO: We just continue to let our grassroots army do what they do best. And that's getting out there, and you have voter contacts. JACKSON: There were once 10 candidates, and everyone was new to running for office. That political inexperience may have added to a major shakeup of the field in late May. Election staff say five candidates, including some big spenders, didn't collect enough valid signatures to make the ballot. Then Republican candidate Donna Brandenburg shared her anger at a May meeting. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DONNA BRANDENBURG: I find this process to be an arbitrary goat rodeo. It's a shame. JACKSON: Reports found a group of paid petitioners working across campaigns had faked thousands of signatures on the candidate's nominating paperwork. Businesswoman Tudor Dixon saw her poll numbers climb following the scandal. She has also racked up endorsements from well-known names in Republican politics, like the family of former U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos. TUDOR DIXON: You know, we've always planned to go around the state and meet people and gain support, gain supporters, and gain the resources to go out there and get our message broadcast louder. And that's what we've been doing. And I think that's what's behind it - hard work. JACKSON: But businessman Kevin Rinke isn't so convinced. He's referred to Dixon as Governor Whitmer in sheep's clothing. KEVIN RINKE: She'll say or do anything for position. I'm a guy that's running to do the right things for the people of Michigan. This is public service for me. JACKSON: Largely self-funded, Rinke pitches himself as an outsider who will slash the personal income tax rate, raise literacy and focus on election integrity. RINKE: We can move Michigan forward by putting the people first, Democrats as well as Republicans. JACKSON: Rinke and Dixon have both seen relatively strong poll numbers lately. But recent polling also suggests a chunk of Republican voters are still undecided. Pam Dawson watched a Republican debate Wednesday night and says that could be due to the large field. PAM DAWSON: They're all strong, you know, in a lot of different ways. And I think they're trying to be a little bit more cautious. They want to make sure that they're going to get the one that's going to beat Whitmer. JACKSON: For Dawson, that's either Soldano or real estate agent Ryan Kelley. The latter saw name recognition spike after the FBI arrested him in June for misdemeanor charges associated with the January 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. Kelley has pleaded not guilty. Despite Kelley's allegiance to the former president, Trump has not made an endorsement in this race. The candidates Soldano, Dixon, Rinke, Kelley and Pastor Ralph Rebandt have all taken similar stances, like wanting to lower taxes and opposing abortion. But pollster Richard Czuba says their ability to attract independent voters will be key to winning the general election against Governor Whitmer. He says two issues will likely dominate. RICHARD CZUBA: We have to watch how is abortion impacting the vote versus how is inflation impacting the vote? And we don't know the answer to that yet. JACKSON: The Democratic Governors Association has already started running attack ads in the GOP primary. Michigan Republican Party spokesperson Gustavo Portela accuses Democrats of meddling. GUSTAVO PORTELA: They're afraid of the message, and they're afraid of the fact that people are going to have a choice this fall. JACKSON: Whoever wins the Republican nomination may have to get used to the pressure. Recent campaign finance reports show Governor Whitmer has millions to spend. For NPR News, I'm Colin Jackson.

The streaming service Hulu says it will start accepting advertising about contentious political issues like abortion rights and gun control. The policy change follows a backlash earlier this week on social media from Democratic groups protesting the fact the streaming service refused to run some of their ads. .@Hulu doesn\u2019t want you to see this ad about the GOP\u2019s plan to ban abortion nationwide. Retweet to make it go viral. pic.twitter.com/by3h6O5btN \"For them to block us from being able to communicate the gravity of the times that we're in was hugely problematic for us,\" said Julie Norton, founding partner at Mosaic Communications, a media consultancy firm that buys ads for Democratic clients. Since Hulu's parent company, Disney, announced Wednesday it would bring the streamer into alignment with its cable services and allow political ads to run, Norton said her firm now might be able to work with the streamer. \"We just have a broader definition of television these days,\" Norton said. \"So these platforms are a critically important way of getting our persuasion advertising to the voters.\" Unlike TV networks, streaming platforms like Hulu and Netflix aren't obliged to comply with the 1934 Communications Act \u2014 the law that requires broadcasters to provide political advertisers with equal access to the airwaves. Broadcast TV is still expected to dominate this fall's cycle with over $4 billion in election ads, according to political ad monitoring firm Kantar CMAG vice president Steve Passwaiter. But Passwaiter said streaming services have a great potential to reach younger and more segmented audiences.  \"This has become the new darling of the political set,\" Passwaiter said. \"And probably by the time this cycle is over there's going to be a billion and a half dollars that finds its way to these ad-supported streaming outlets.\"Passwaiter said it won't be too long before streamers end up looking a lot like broadcast and cable channels in terms of both the volume \u2014 and the array \u2014 of ads all along the political spectrum. But Mike Shields, founder and partner of the Republican political marketing and strategy company Convergence Media said his firm is waiting to see who gets to place ads with Hulu and how those ads are treated before considering it a win for his clients. \"Conservatives have every right to be skeptical when something like this happens to make sure that it is done fairly and in a balanced way,\" Shields said.In its announcement, shared with NPR via email, Disney said, \"Hulu will now accept candidate and issue advertisements covering a wide spectrum of policy positions.\" But the company still \"reserves the right to request edits [to meet] industry standards.\"",

HELENA, Mont. \u2014 The Dobbs decision leaves abortion policy up to states and state supreme courts are now a key player in deciding which laws will stand. Seats on those courts will be up for election in more than 30 states and parties are strategizing. Since Dobbs, state abortion law has already been put before state supreme courts in Utah, Michigan, Louisiana and Arizona, among others. In Montana, there's a list of reasons Republicans are laser-focused on the judiciary, and at the top of that list is to ban abortion. In 1999, the state supreme court said Montana's constitutional right to privacy protects access to abortion and Republicans are looking for a way around that precedent, known as the Armstrong decision. At the recent Montana GOP state convention, party chairman Don Kaltschmidt urged the crowd to support two candidates for state supreme court this election cycle \u2014 Justice Jim Rice and attorney James Brown. \"It's going to be historic for the sake of our conservative values,\" Kaltschmidt said. Elections for the Montana Supreme Court are nonpartisan, but Rice and Brown are known conservatives. In 2020, Montana Republicans won all statewide elected offices and gained 10 seats in the state legislature. The state supreme court is the party's last territory to conquer. \"We basically have two paths forward. We can either amend the Montana Constitution to ban abortion, or we can replace enough justices on the Montana Supreme Court to overturn the Armstrong decision,\" said Jeff Laszloffy \u2014 a well-known conservative lobbyist and president of the Montana Family Foundation \u2014 in an audio update sent to radio stations across the state. Montana Democrats are putting their weight behind incumbent state Justice Ingrid Gustafson, who faces Brown in the general election. State Sen. Diane Sands, a Democrat who's advocated for abortion rights since the 1960s, recently visited the White House for a roundtable with Vice President Harris and talked about Republicans targeting the judiciary. \"This is not a problem the federal government can solve.\" She highlighted Republican legislation passed last year that gave Montana's governor unilateral power to appoint judges to vacant positions in between elections. That was previously the job of an independent commission. \"In the long game, these forces in Montana are going after the Montana Constitution because they know it is the sole barrier to achieving their goal of making abortion illegal,\" Sands said. Democrats in Montana want to protect the Armstrong ruling. The state is one of 10 across the country where state supreme courts have decided their state constitutions protect abortion. But those rulings aren't necessarily set in stone. In Iowa in 2018, for instance, the state supreme court overturned a precedent protecting abortion. \"In 1999, around seven states had judges who'd run in a million dollar race, but by 2016, 20 states had a judge who'd run in a million dollar race,\" says Douglas Keith, counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice Democracy Program. Those numbers are adjusted for inflation. Keith says partisan, dark money groups have been getting involved in these races, and that the biggest spender in judicial elections today is the Republican State Leadership Committee, which has backed James Brown in Montana.",

With friends like these ... President Biden is facing his lowest approval rating since taking office, and it's largely due to Democrats, the latest NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll finds. Biden's approval rating in the poll is now at 36%. That's a 4 percentage-point drop from June, and inside the numbers, it's attributable to a 9-point decline within his own party. While 75% of Democrats approve of the job Biden is doing, that's considered low for a president's own party. Last month, 84% of Democrats said they approved of the job Biden was doing, according to the survey. Republicans and independents are far lower \u2014 just 5% of Republicans and only 28% of independents approve of the job Biden is doing. Those are unchanged from a month ago. Loading... For context, Donald Trump's approval within his party when he was president was never that low in the poll, not even after the Jan. 6 insurrection (77%) or the Charlottesville, Va., white supremacist demonstration (76%), at which one person was killed \u2014 and whose participants Trump dismissed as \"very fine people, on both sides.\" Loading... In this survey, four times as many respondents said they strongly disapprove of the job Biden is doing than approve \u2014 43% to 11%. And only 30% of Democrats said they strongly approve of the job the president is doing. Biden has continually faced a lack of enthusiasm among his base. He was never progressives' preferred choice for president, but many held their nose to vote for him against Trump. That was certainly true for younger voters. In 2020, voters 45 and younger went for Biden by a 56%-42% margin, according to exit polls. But in this survey, 63% say they disapprove of the job Biden is doing. Just 30% approve, compared with 40% of those 45 and older. Younger voters are also among the least enthusiastic about Biden \u2014 just 5% say they strongly approve of the job he's doing, on par with whites without college degrees and white evangelical Christians, reliably Republican voters. In his run for the White House, Biden promised progressives the political equivalent of the moon, but he has run into the realities of governing. Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.V., chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, announced he would not support funding of the Biden administration's climate and energy programs.\n                \n                    \n                    Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.V., chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, announced he would not support funding of the Biden administration's climate and energy programs. From voting rights and abortion to student debt and climate change measures, Biden has failed to convince enough senators to go along. Often, it has been one Democratic senator in particular who has stood in the way and drawn progressives' ire: Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia. Many progressives, angry at the conservative lurch in the country due to recent Supreme Court decisions on guns and abortion, say they think Biden simply hasn't acted boldly enough to fight for their initiatives. They say he has also repeatedly folded in negotiations and put too much stock in the power of his personal relationships, particularly with Manchin. Progressives bristle at the fact that Biden hasn't pushed to punish Manchin by, for example, stripping him of his energy committee chairmanship. That, however, would likely have cascading consequences. Democrats hold the Senate by the slimmest of majorities: 50-50, with Vice President Harris coming in to break ties. If Manchin, who comes from a state that Trump won by 40 points in 2020, bolted to the Republican Party, that would hand the keys to the Senate over to Republican leader Mitch McConnell. The result: no more Biden judges approved to federal benches or even the chance at any of progressives' priorities passed, like Affordable Care Act subsidies. Biden's cratered approval numbers are a bad sign for Democrats in this midterm election year. The party in power traditionally faces headwinds in a president's first midterm, and when its president's approval rating is this low, that can spell even more trouble. That said, Democrats are outpacing Biden's approval ratings in the congressional ballot, in which poll respondents are asked, if the election were held today, whether they would vote for the generic Democrat or Republican. Democrats are doing the same in several Senate races as well. And while Republicans are still heavily favored to win control of the House, Democrats hope to stem the damage, in part because of increased Democratic enthusiasm to vote after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, as they paint Republicans as extreme. A gasoline pump displays fuel prices at a gas station in Falls Church, Va., on Tuesday.\n                \n                    \n                    Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption A gasoline pump displays fuel prices at a gas station in Falls Church, Va., on Tuesday. But questions are already beginning to emerge about the strength of a Biden 2024 reelection bid. Not only are his approval ratings lower than those of any president at the same point in their presidencies since World War II, but he is facing inflation that's the highest it has been in decades as well as high gas prices. A recent New York Times/Siena College poll found that two-thirds of Democrats said they preferred someone else to be their party's standard-bearer in 2024, citing, principally, Biden's age. ''We need a president with the vision, courage and power to achieve voting rights, a rapid transition to renewable energy, universal health care, access to abortion in all states, and controls on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines,\" Pia Gallegos, who chairs the board of the progressive group RootsAction, which is circulating a petition for Biden not to run in 2024, said in an email. \"President Biden has not shown himself to be the president we need.\" Finding a replacement, though, is easier dreamed than is practical. Vice President Harris' favorability ratings in polls are about the same as or worse than Biden's. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg is slightly better liked, but not necessarily among Democrats. Buttigieg also struggled with voters of color in the 2020 presidential primary, and you can't win the Democratic nomination without winning nonwhite voters. What's more, Democratic strategists say, it would cause a firestorm within the party to be perceived as taking away the nomination from the first Black person, Asian American and woman to serve as vice president. Biden owes his presidency, in large measure, to Black voters. In the current NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist survey, nonwhite voters give Biden a 40% approval rating, higher than whites did (34%), but not where Biden \u2014 or any Democrat \u2014 would want that figure to be. All that said, in this age of polarization, Biden still seems to have at least an even-money chance of winning, particularly if it's a rematch between him and Trump. In that Siena poll, for example, Biden is slightly ahead of his predecessor, Trump, the leading potential GOP candidate at this point, by 3 points, well within the margin of error, but it shows the difference between approval ratings and election choices. The survey of 1,160 adults was conducted July 11 through 17 and has a margin of error of +/- 4.1 percentage points. Respondents were reached using live callers via cellphone and landline.",

Wade by the Supreme Court on July 14. The House on Tuesday voted to protect same-sex and interracial marriages, a direct confrontation with the Supreme Court. WASHINGTON \u2014 The U.S. House overwhelmingly approved legislation Tuesday to protect same-sex and interracial marriages amid concerns that the Supreme Court ruling overturning Roe v. Wade abortion access could jeopardize other rights criticized by many conservative Americans. In a robust but lopsided debate, Democrats argued intensely in favor of enshrining marriage equality in federal law, while Republicans steered clear of openly rejecting gay marriage. Instead leading Republicans portrayed the bill as unnecessary amid other issues facing the nation. Tuesday's election-year roll call, 267-157, was partly political strategy, forcing all House members, Republicans and Democrats, to go on the record with their views. It also reflected the legislative branch pushing back against an aggressive court that has sparked fears it may revisit apparently settled U.S. laws. \"For me, this is personal,\" said Rep. Mondaire Jones, D-N.Y., who said he was among the openly gay members of the House. \"Imagine telling the next generation of Americans, my generation, we no longer have the right to marry,\" he said. \"Congress can't allow that to happen.\" Wary of political fallout, GOP leaders did not direct their lawmakers to hold the party line against the bill, aides said. Dozens of Republicans joined Democrats in voting for passage. While the Respect for Marriage Act is expected to pass the House, with a Democratic majority, it is almost certain to stall in the evenly split Senate, where most Republicans would likely join a filibuster to block it. It's one of several bills, including those enshrining abortion access, that Democrats are proposing to confront the court's conservative majority. Another bill, guaranteeing access to contraceptive services, is set for a vote later this week. The Biden administration issued a statement of support for the marriage bill. Polling shows a majority of Americans favor preserving rights to marry whom one wishes, regardless of the person's sex, gender, race or ethnicity, a long-building shift in modern mores toward inclusion. A Gallup poll in June showed broad and increasing support for same-sex marriage, with 70% of U.S. adults saying they think such unions should be recognized by law as valid. The poll showed majority support among both Democrats (83%) and Republicans (55%). Approval of interracial marriage in the U.S. hit a six-decade high at 94% in September, according to Gallup. \"The extremist right-wing majority on the Supreme Court has put our country down a perilous path,\" said Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon, D-Pa., in a floor speech setting Tuesday's process in motion. \"It's time for our colleagues across the aisle to stand up and be counted. Will they vote to protect these fundamental freedoms? Or will they vote to let states take those freedoms away?\" But Republicans insisted Tuesday that the court was only focused on abortion access in June when it struck down the nearly 50-year-old Roe v. Wade ruling, and they argued that same-sex marriage and other rights were not threatened. In fact, of all the Republicans who rose to speak during the morning debate, almost none directly broached the subject of same-sex or interracial marriage. \"We are here for a political charade, we are here for political messaging,\" said Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee. As several Democrats spoke of inequalities they said that they or their loved ones had faced in same-sex marriages, the Republicans talked about rising gas prices, inflation and crime, including recent threats to justices in connection with the abortion ruling. Even as it passed the House with Republican votes, the outcome in the Senate is uncertain. \"I'm probably not inclined to support it,\" said Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo. \"The predicate of this is just wrong. I don't think the Supreme Court is going to overturn any of that stuff.\" For Republicans in Congress the Trump-era confirmation of conservative justices to the Supreme Court fulfilled a long-term GOP goal of revisiting many social, environmental and regulatory issues the party has been unable to tackle on its own by passing bills that could be signed into law. But in a notable silence, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell declined to express his view on the bill, leaving an open question over how strongly his party would fight it, if it even comes up for a vote in the upper chamber. \"I don't see anything behind this right now other than, you know, election year politics,\" said the GOP whip, Sen. John Thune of South Dakota. The Respect for Marriage Act would repeal a law from the Clinton era that defines marriage as a heterogeneous relationship between a man and a woman. It would also provide legal protections for interracial marriages by prohibiting any state from denying out-of-state marriage licenses and benefits on the basis of sex, race, ethnicity or national origin. The 1996 law, the Defense of Marriage Act, had basically been sidelined by Obama-era court rulings, including Obergefell v. Hodges, which established the rights of same-sex couples to marry nationwide, a landmark case for gay rights. But last month, writing for the majority in overturning Roe v. Wade, Justice Samuel Alito argued for a more narrow interpretation of the rights guaranteed to Americans, noting that the right to an abortion was not spelled out in the Constitution. In a concurring opinion, Justice Clarence Thomas went further, saying other rulings similar to Roe, including those around same-sex marriage and the right for couples to use contraception, should be reconsidered. While Alito insisted in the majority opinion that \"this decision concerns the constitutional right to abortion and no other right,\" others have taken notice. \"The MAGA radicals that are taking over the Republican Party have made it abundantly clear they are not satisfied with repealing Roe,\" said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., referring to Trump's backers. He pointed to comments from Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who said over the weekend that the Supreme Court's decision protecting marriage equality was \"clearly wrong\" and state legislatures should visit the issue. But Schumer did not commit to holding a vote on the bill. Jim Obergefell, the plaintiff in the landmark ruling legalizing same-sex marriage and now running as a Democrat for the Ohio House, said after the court's ruling on abortion, \"When we lose one right that we have relied on and enjoyed, other rights are at risk.\"",

Tony Evers speaks at a campaign event outside the state Capitol Friday, May 27, 2022, in Madison, Wis. Rallies for abortion rights often are packed with young activists. At a recent rally in Kenosha, Wisc., Lorraine Terry was an exception. \"I'm Lorraine Terry, and I'm way too old for reproduction,\" is how she introduced herself. \"But I've got children and granddaughters, and I cannot believe they are taking away a benefit we've had for 50 years.\" Terry is 86 and remembers well what life was like before Roe v. Wade. \"I lived on the first floor where a woman in my apartment building couldn't carry a baby \u2013 tried to abort her own baby with knitting needles and died,\" Terry said. \"She had two young children. So, I saw that. I saw the pain that happens when you can't get an abortion when you need one.\" All of which makes reelecting Democratic Gov. Tony Evers really important to her. \"We have to get Evers in in the state of Wisconsin. I mean, that's our saving grace: That if we have Republican legislators, that he has the veto power,\" Terry said. Wisconsin's state legislative map is considered heavily gerrymandered in favor of Republicans. So, many Democrats see Evers as their one chance to stop whatever laws the legislature might pass. That makes the governor's race one example of a truth some Democrats are confronting in this year's midterms: that if they score some hard-fought wins, the policy gains are uncertain and may simply amount to holding the line against further abortion restrictions after the Supreme Court overturned Roe. That could make convincing outraged voters that it's worth it to vote for Democrats this fall a challenge. And the governor's race in Wisconsin could be a close one; it's currently rated a toss-up by the Cook Political Report. Evers has been able to take some action already \u2014 for example, he announced he would give clemency to abortion providers punished under the state's pre-Roe ban, enacted in 1849. That matters to Hiroshi Kanno, who came out to see Evers speak in Portage. \"If he doesn't get reelected, the clemency is meaningless for health providers. And that's why I'm going to work extra hard for him,\" Kanno said. \"I have six daughters, and one of them has had problems. And if you don't have that access, who knows what'll happen, you know?\" Evers continues to be emphatic about the importance of abortion rights, even though a lot of voters are focused on the economy. \"We can walk and chew gum at the same time, but I can tell you that when we start taking away rights from people, that does transcend inflation. You know, inflation is important. We got to take care of it. But when you're dealing with people's lives, that's really important,\" he said. In Wisconsin's Senate race, the vibe is different, but similar \u2013 different, because one senator doesn't have the policy influence a governor does. Similar, because in both cases, an electoral win means at best only modest, or potential, wins for abortion rights. A Senate win in Wisconsin wouldn't mean codifying Roe unless Democrats not only controlled the Senate, but had 51 Democratic votes to overturn the filibuster. Lieutenant Gov. Mandela Barnes is a leading Democratic candidate for Senate, and spoke to NPR during a kickoff for campaign door-knockers earlier this month. \"I always tell people, yeah, of course I'll be one vote. And that's why we need 51 votes and we don't get to 51 if we don't start somewhere,\" he said. \"And getting [Republican Senator] Ron Johnson out of the way is the key to getting us closer to 51 votes to codify the right to choose into law by getting rid of the filibuster.\" Overturning the filibuster to protect abortion rights was a key part of the pitch that a Barnes doorknocker made that day. Voter Joelle Beth Timm, who answered her door, said the Dobbs decision would weigh heavily on her vote. \"I'm pretty angry, and I have some t-shirts that say 'Mind your own uterus,' so they're getting a lot of wear recently,\" she said. \"So, yeah, it's absolutely an issue. Quite frankly, it's probably the number one issue that I've voted on in my life.\" Many Democrats, like Timm, are furious at the Supreme Court. And many also are angry at party leaders like Joe Biden, believing that they haven't fought hard enough for abortion rights over the years. Back at the Evers event, Dick Baker, chair of the Columbia County Democrats, pushed back against that frustration. \"We're working behind the scenes with our candidates and trying to turn the tide in our favor,\" he said. \"And maybe we're often accused of being too nice, but I'd rather be too nice than the alternative.\" Mayor Ann Groves Lloyd of Lodi, a town of 3,000, is much more upset with the party. \"I want the filibuster gone. You know damn well if the midterms swing the other way [to the Republicans], the filibuster will be gone in a heartbeat, and they're going to shove through a ton of conservative policies,\" she said. \"I guess part of me just doesn't want us to be so nice anymore about what we're doing.\"",

It was a careful step back into the spotlight for Pennsylvania Democratic U.S. Senate nominee John Fetterman. Sidelined for two months by a minor stroke suffered just days before the primary in May, Fetterman walked into a campaign office in Pittsburgh last Saturday, surprising a couple dozen volunteers there for a weekend training session. They stood and cheered the sight of the candidate they hope can flip a Republican-held Senate seat in November. In a political environment that's expected to be difficult for Democrats, they know the task will be difficult, and a healthy Fetterman is important to accomplish that goal. There were no reporters in the room to witness the moment. Visual evidence came in the form of a short campaign video shared by Fetterman later that day. Hellllloooo Pittsburgh!!Made a surprise visit to the @AllIn_PA volunteer training this morning.I\u2019m feeling *great* and it was *so* incredibly special to be with youMissed yinz \ud83e\udd70 pic.twitter.com/XIB6crSZqu In the clip, the candidate enters the room with his wife Gisele (who filled in for him with a rousing speech at his primary night victory party in May).  Fetterman is wearing his usual \u2014 and now well known \u2014 campaign attire of basketball shorts, sneakers and a hooded sweatshirt. Not using a microphone, he shouts out, \"It's incredibly special to be back here in this room with all of you.\" Fetterman looks healthy, though his voice is not quite as booming as it was during primary campaigning earlier in the year. He does appear to choke up a bit as he talks of what he's been through. \"I gotta tell you, it was nearly, almost was the end of my life.\" He then adds, \"And it's totally changed my life since then.\" While Fetterman was hospitalized, he acknowledged that in 2017 he'd been diagnosed with a heart condition \u2014 atrial fibrillation. But he largely ignored it and hadn't seen his doctor in the past five years. His current doctors said that condition is what led to his latest health troubles in May. Now, as Fetterman's team says he plans to return to in-person campaigning, it comes as issues such as abortion rights and gun violence have taken on a new intensity. Fetterman's health scare roiled the Senate race, in which he's running against Republican Dr. Mehmet Oz \u2014 a first-time candidate better known as the daytime television personality. Oz has been endorsed by former President Donald Trump, and won the GOP nomination by just a slim margin after a recount. In the days and weeks after Fetterman's stroke, his supporters wondered what it would mean, both for him and for the election. Greg Boulware, 43, a city worker in Philadelphia, told NPR last month, \"Oh, that was a little scary. Like, it was day to day, getting different news bits about what was going on.\" There were more questions than answers, he added: \"Whether he would maintain in the race. Whether he would drop out. What was going to happen?\" But another Fetterman voter in Philadelphia, 63-year-old IT worker Carlton Sampson, had no such worries. \"I got a heart condition too, so, it's like it makes me feel even closer to him,\" he said, laughing. \"You know, means he's mortal too.\" But Sampson did advise Fetterman to follow his doctor's advice. The candidate \u2014 who has now had a pacemaker and defibrillator implanted \u2014 is known as an energetic, unconventional campaigner. He's a Democrat who spends a lot of time in union halls, family restaurants and VFW posts shaking hands and having conversations in rural Pennsylvania \u2014 a part of the state often referred to as Trump Country. He's a former small town mayor with a blue-collar vibe \u2014 though his resume also includes an MBA and a master's degree in public policy from Harvard. The coming months will determine if voters see his health as an issue. But while he's been recuperating, other major issues have come to the fore in the election. Top among them are the horrific mass shootings of recent months, and abortion rights following the Supreme Court ruling to overturn Roe v. Wade. Polling shows that Pennsylvanians overwhelmingly support legal abortion, which means the court's decision could motivate more moderate voters to back Fetterman, who pledges to end the Senate legislative filibuster to codify Roe into law. Oz, meanwhile, has praised the court's ruling. That said, economic anxiety and soaring inflation still top the list of voter concerns in Pennsylvania and elsewhere. Add in President Biden's dismal job approval ratings and Oz is counting on voters holding Democrats accountable. Berwood Yost, a pollster at Franklin and Marshall College in Pennsylvania, says pocketbook issues are not likely to fade in importance in the state. So that's seen as good news for Republicans. \"The economy and President Biden's performance are both at the same place they were in May during the primary,\" Yost said. \"And so the foundational issues that are shaping this campaign have stayed in place.\" What isn't known is just how potent abortion and gun violence will be in motivating voters. \"We've never had a circumstance in a midterm election where an established fundamental right has been rescinded by the court,\" Yost said, referring to abortion. \"So we don't really know what it means.\" While recovering from his health incident, Fetterman has been using abortion rights and the need for stronger gun regulations to try to drive interest among suburban voters, who often make the difference in the closely divided state. Democratic activists across Pennsylvania are already doing the same. Heather Isbell Schumacher, 38, works as an archivist and lives in Delaware County outside Philadelphia. She says the abortion ruling makes things especially urgent. Her focus is on both the Senate and gubernatorial races. \"We have to hold the line in Pennsylvania,\" she said. \"To me, this is holding the line, protecting a basic right.\" She said she sees what's already happening in states around the country, where strict anti-abortion laws have already kicked in. She pointed to a place she once called home: \"I lived in Texas for many years. I have family still there. I honestly feel like if we don't elect these two Democrats [in Pennsylvania], are we going to be Texas? That's scary.\" Fetterman's campaign stresses that he'll keep talking about his plans for the economy, as well as for abortion rights and gun violence. For the past two months he's continued doing just that on social media and in op-ed pieces in local newspapers. His campaign won't say exactly when he'll start doing events for the general public, offering only that it'll likely be in the next week or two.",

Soon after the Supreme Court voted to overturn Roe v. Wade, dozens of prosecutors nationwide \u2014 including at least five in Texas, representing some of the state's most populous counties \u2014 declared they would not pursue charges against people who seek or provide abortions. In response, a group of conservative Texas legislators have hatched a plan to circumvent those local district attorneys: allow prosecutors from other parts of the state to enforce the laws for them. \"The legislation that we will introduce next session will empower district attorneys from throughout the state to prosecute abortion-related crimes ... when the local district attorney fails or refuses to do so,\" wrote Rep. Mayes Middleton, chairman of the Texas Freedom Caucus, in a letter sent last week to a law firm he accused of aiding illegal abortions. A law firm in Texas pledged to reimburse the travel costs of employees who leave Texas to murder their unborn children. We are putting them and others on notice of the illegality and consequences of their actions under pre-Roe statutes. See our letter below: #txlege #ProtectLife pic.twitter.com/ef8KNRYbwE The idea has been circulating since at least March, after the Texas Supreme Court shut down the final challenge to S.B. 8 \u2014 the state bill that effectively banned most abortions even before Roe was overturned by deputizing private citizens to sue anybody who provided an abortion, or helped a woman seek one. \"Abortion funds think they can flout the law because a local district attorney refuses to bring charges. We'll fix this problem next session,\" said Republican state Rep. Briscoe Cain that month, when he announced he would introduce the bill. Cain did not respond to a request for comment. If Cain's proposal passes, it would be another highly unusual modification to the traditional criminal justice system in Texas, following in the footsteps of S.B. 8, which used its private lawsuit mechanism to sidestep the Roe-era constitutionality issues of an outright criminal ban. \"It's an example of the same kind of tactical ethos on the part of the Republican Party, which is, 'We're just going to rewrite the playbook,' \" said Jennifer Laurin, a professor at the University of Texas Law School. In almost every state, including Texas, prosecutors are elected by people who live in their area of jurisdiction. If voters don't like how a prosecutor has chosen to pursue some types of crime over others \u2014 like police prosecutions, marijuana offenses, or immigration-related crimes \u2014 they can vote differently next time. Prosecutors elected by Democratic majorities in Dallas, San Antonio and Austin have already said they will not pursue abortion-related charges. \"I don't want women who live in our community suffering or dying at home because they're too scared to go to the doctor and get the medical attention that they need,\" said Travis County District Attorney Jos\u00e9 Garza last week in an interview with NPR. Garza says he sees more pressing issues in his county, which includes Austin, like working to reduce gun violence. \"To pool resources away from that work to pursue this kind of political prosecution would destabilize our community and make it less safe,\" he said. Cain's proposal would allow such prosecutions to go ahead anyway, no matter what local voters may prefer. If it passes, an abortion fund based in Austin \u2014 where Joe Biden won 72% of the vote in 2020 \u2014 could be prosecuted by a district attorney from Lubbock, where Trump won with 65%. Austin voters may be unhappy, but they would have no recourse in any subsequent Lubbock County election. In an interview last month with Dallas TV station WFAA, a reporter raised this question directly to Cain. Wouldn't the proposal, the reporter asked, \"essentially overturn, or move out of the way, a duly elected official?\" \"I guess that's how it would work. That's the idea,\" Cain replied. \"And we're gonna go for it.\" Abortions in Texas have already come to a halt. After S.B. 8 went into effect last year, abortions fell by more than 60%. Now that Roe v. Wade has been overturned, a near-total ban on abortion from 1925 is back in effect. Abortion providers in the state say they have ceased providing abortion services. Still, conservative lawmakers say they are not done targeting abortion rights. Along with Cain's district attorney proposal, the Texas Freedom Caucus has prepared a raft of other legislation, including a bill that would impose criminal penalties on employers for covering elective abortions in their health insurance. Another would allow private citizens to sue anyone who pays for a Texas resident to receive an abortion out of state. The passage of the DA proposal is not guaranteed. In Texas, the state legislature is not scheduled to convene until January 2023. Barring a special legislative session before then, lawmakers must wait until then to introduce the bill, which then must be approved by both legislative chambers. Another factor is November's gubernatorial election. If voters re-elect Gov. Greg Abbott, a fiercely anti-abortion Republican, he may be likely to sign the bill. But his Democratic challenger, Beto O'Rourke, has vowed to veto any such legislation. Beto O'Rourke, the Democratic candidate for Texas governor, speaks at a rally in June. He has vowed to veto new abortion restrictions.\n                \n                    \n                    Sergio Flores/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Beto O'Rourke, the Democratic candidate for Texas governor, speaks at a rally in June. He has vowed to veto new abortion restrictions. It's also not clear whether the district attorney legislation could survive legal scrutiny. Texas has a strong tradition of localized prosecution, Laurin said, pointing to a 2021 decision by Texas's highest criminal court that found the Texas attorney general could not prosecute election law offenses without the explicit approval of local prosecutors. It is \"plausible,\" she said, that a court could rule similarly about non-local prosecutors. Garza, the Travis County DA, was more confident. \"The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, the highest court in the state of Texas for criminal cases, and the Texas Constitution are incredibly clear that the only entity that has authority to pursue prosecutions in a community is the office of the district attorney, locally elected by the people,\" he said. But the most clear and direct way to challenge such a law would be to wait for a non-local prosecutor to file charges, and then for the defendant to make the argument in court that the charges should be dismissed, Laurin said. With a felony conviction and jail time on the line, few potential defendants may be willing to take the risk.",

As states grapple with the future of abortion, Michigan could become one of the first in the nation to let voters decide the matter. A proposed constitutional amendment there would override a 90-year-old state law that makes abortion a felony, even in the case of rape or incest. The U.S. Supreme Court's overturning of Roe v. Wade has revived that abortion ban \u2014 and galvanized abortion rights advocates to secure new protections. Much of the momentum is coming from activists who're getting involved for the first time. This story was produced in partnership with Kaiser Health News. \"I wanted to do something, but I had no political experience or really any experience in activism,\" says Amanda Mazur, a working mother of two who lives in rural northwest Michigan. \"But I thought, maybe I can volunteer, and just offer something tangible to the movement.\" This week, organizers like Mazur submitted more than 750,000 signatures \u2014 which they say is a \"historic\" record \u2014 to state election officials in hopes of having the amendment appear on the November ballot. If just over half of those signatures are validated, Michigan voters will decide whether to amend the state's constitution to guarantee broad, individual rights to \"reproductive freedom,\" including abortion, contraception and fertilty treatments. The change would also allow abortions later in pregnancy, if the patient's \"physical or mental health\" is at stake. While it has the backing of medical groups like the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG,) already conservative groups are attacking it as a \"radical\" and dangerous, claiming it would \"allow late-term abortions for practically any reason.\" For Mazur, the desire to \"do something\" started in 2017, when she and her husband gave their then-two year old daughter some happy news: she was going to be a big sister. The family was thrilled. But then, doctors told Mazur something was wrong. \"I found out halfway through the pregnancy that the baby my husband and I hoped for, suffered from a rare and life-limiting genetic condition,\" says Mazur.  \"We ultimately made the compassionate choice to end the pregnancy for my well-being, and for the well-being of our family, and the life of what we thought would be our child.\" Devastated, Mazur turned to a national online support group where others were experiencing the same loss. But unlike her, many in the group said they were having a tough time finding a way to terminate their pregnancies. Parents were \"sharing...the shame and the stigma surrounding it,\" she says.  \"It really broke my heart that you're going through this already devastating experience, but have to travel far away from your home across the country...[and] advocate for yourself like crazy just to get care that you have decided with your doctor is best for you.\" The experience was life-changing for Mazur. At the time, abortion rights in Michigan seemed pretty stable, but, this year, Mazur's political awakening found an outlet. Reproductive Freedom for All, a petition group backed by the ACLU of Michigan and Planned Parenthood Advocates of Michigan, was gathering signatures for the constitutional amendment to enshrine abortion protections in state law. The effort took on new urgency in May after the leak of the Supreme Court's draft decision on the Dobbs case. \"Folks realized that this big, scary thing that they did not think would happen, might actually happen,\" says Jessica Ayoub, a field organizer with the ACLU of Michigan. Some Michiganders were registering to vote just to be eligible to sign the petition. Jaynie Hoerauf, a 62-year-old attorney in Farwell, drove 40 miles to attend a rally where she knew she could sign. \"I was just astonished how many people there were,\" says Hoerauf. \"A bunch of us were so ticked off [about the Supreme Court overturning Roe] and we were talking about it. And I was like, 'I'm just going to go on and find where I can sign the stupid petition.\" In the week after Roe was overturned, there were nearly 200 events throughout the state \u2014 everything from small gatherings at farmer's markets to full-fledged rallies. Activists on both sides expect to spend millions. They predict donations will also pour in from outside Michigan, and that voters in other states will be watching. There are two other states \u2014 California and Vermont \u2014 with similar proposals to protect abortion rights on their November ballots: But unlike those states, Michigan has a ban in place that could soon eliminate the ability to get an abortion. While the 1931 abortion law isn't being enforced yet because of ongoing lawsuits, that could change any day. \"This is just the start of our fight,\" says Ayoub. \"We know that it is a long road to November.\"",

            "article_content": "President Biden signs an executive order on abortion access, positive signs for the U.S. economy, and trouble for former President Donald Trump: we review the week in politics.  SCOTT SIMON, HOST: President Biden expressed shock and sadness over the assassination of Prime Minister Abe yesterday and then remarked on how rare gun violence is in Japan compared to the U.S. His comment comes just a few days after the mass shooting at a public July 4 event in Highland Park, Ill., that killed seven people, left dozens more wounded and even more traumatized. Joining us now to talk about the week in politics, as he does most Saturdays, NPR's Ron Elving. Ron, thanks so much for being with us. RON ELVING, BYLINE: Good to be with you, Scott. SIMON: Ron, what does it say in America that the man charged with the Highland Park shooting was labeled a clear and present danger by local police in a state with stringent gun laws but still passed background checks to buy a gun? ELVING: It says our laws and our lawmakers are out of step with most Americans. Too many of our elected officials have surrendered to an extreme view of gun ownership that not even gun owners support. The latest poll done by NPR and Ipsos was before the Highland Park shooting, and it showed roughly two-thirds of Americans who own at least one gun favor red flag laws and raising the minimum age for assault weapons. More than 80% of them support background checks, meaningful ones. When you have people such as the Highland Park shooter, people obviously calling out for help, the answer is not to give them an assault rifle that's designed to kill as many humans as possible. SIMON: Yesterday, two weeks after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, President Biden signed an executive order on abortion access. What is this order supposed to accomplish? ELVING: The idea is to salvage something from the ruins of Roe, some way to help women who want to exercise some degree of control over their pregnancies. So there's a pledge to protect abortion providers, including the people setting up clinics just over the state line from where abortion access is being restricted or denied. And he ordered up a plan to guarantee the availability of abortion by medication and access to emergency contraception and IUDs. Of course, what this executive order does not do, and what no executive order could do, is to restore the right to abortion under the Constitution. The president can't do that on his own, no matter how much people want him to. So bottom line, Biden wants people to know where he stands and that he'll do what he can. If people want the right to abortion codified in law, they have to elect state and federal lawmakers who will do just that. SIMON: Some positive news for the U.S. economy yesterday - 372,000 new jobs in June, which was much better than expected. But what does this say about the overall health of the economy? ELVING: Off the top, it's got to be good to see more jobs being created and the unemployment rate historically low. These numbers suggest any talk of recession is premature at this point. Of course, there's no silver lining without a cloud, and great jobs numbers mean higher wages, more inflation pressure. So the Federal Reserve is more likely to keep raising interest rates in the months ahead, and that could spell recession down the road. SIMON: Finally, Ron, former White House counsel under Donald Trump Pat Cipollone testified before the January 6 committee yesterday, closed session. And several of Trump's most vocal allies, including personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, Senator Lindsey Graham, were subpoenaed by a special grand jury in Fulton County, Ga., over the president's attempts to overturn the 2020 election results in that state. Ron, is it me or getting just a little hot in here? ELVING: Of course, the former president is no stranger to legal exposure. But right now the heat is pouring in from every register in the room. That Georgia tape recording of Trump saying just find me 11,000 votes seems the best evidence we've seen so far. It's always seemed like the clearest path to a criminal proceeding. But you've also got the New York civil case about the dubious property evaluations. And as for Pat Cipollone, well, Trump has had many lawyers, but few, if any, have had Cipollone's credentials and reputation. He's defended Trump against impeachment charges, and now here he is being downloaded by a congressional committee behind closed doors. It can't be fun to have your legal defender doing that unless, of course, you have nothing to hide. And maybe we'll find out more about that in videotape testimony when the committee goes back on TV next week. SIMON: NPR's Ron Elving, thanks so much. ELVING: Thank you, Scott.

For two decades, abortion rights opponents have drafted so-called model legislation and lobbied to get the measures to restrict and ban abortions passed in statehouses across the country in preparation for the eventual fall of Roe v. Wade. The model legislation and concerted political pressure from national organizations that oppose abortion rights resulted in key terms being cemented into laws, the limitation of abortion access and the influence behind the trigger laws that will go into effect in 13 states this summer as a result of the Supreme Court's recent decision to overturn Roe. Leading the pack in crafting anti-abortion legislation are Americans United for Life and the National Right to Life Committee, that provide model bill services, legal counsel and advocacy efforts for the anti-abortion movement, including the drafting of abortion-limiting and -banning bills. \"Building on the momentum from last year, two states, Idaho and Utah, passed conditional bills similar to AUL's model bill, which would ban abortion in the event that Roe v. Wade was overturned or lawmaking authority was otherwise handed back to the states,\" touts AUL's 2020 state legislative sessions report. Over the last several decades, the two groups have worked toward increasing abortion restrictions nationwide, ultimately leading to abortion bans in some states, said Elizabeth Nash, state policy analyst for the Guttmacher Institute, a think tank that supports abortion rights. \"What the national groups have been able to do is essentially craft this language on restrictions and bans and they have the networks to spread it across the country in all of these state legislatures. So you do see these very similar bills just moving very quickly and that has given momentum to restrictions,\" Nash said. \"So we saw these legislatures adopting restriction after restriction and that moved states to then start thinking about abortion bans because most of these states had adopted pretty much every restriction in the book.\" This legislative pattern occurred as the makeup of the Supreme Court became  more conservative. \"Little by little with this incremental approach, we've been able to strip Roe of its origin,\" said Ingrid Duran, director of the Department of State Legislation at the National Right to Life Committee. \"That's why after all of these election cycles and different political appointments, it was very easy to see the demise of Roe.\" The two national groups, according to Nash, have largely focused their efforts on restrictions on abortion that could be immediately enacted with few legal challenges. Total bans, were the court to overturn Roe, were more symbolic. \"It originally appeared to be a way for state legislatures to basically announce their intent that they supported abortion bans,\" Nash said. \"But because the effective date was in the future, it was also not possible to challenge the bans because they weren't going into effect.\" Over the past several decades, the National Right to Life Committee has succeeded in getting its model legislation drafts enacted across the country. One example is its draft of the \"Pain Capable Unborn Child Act,\" which makes it illegal to perform abortions after 20 weeks, the point at which advocates claim a fetus can feel pain. National Right to Life's version of the bill has been enacted in 16 states, according to Duran, though it has been legally blocked in Idaho. Beginning in 2016, 13 states have passed NRLC's model legislation of the Unborn Child Protection from Dismemberment Abortion Act, which all include the same definition of \"dismemberment.\" Kentucky used the same model but adopted its own \"dismemberment\" definition. Many of these laws were paused by legal disputes. Also during the Trump years, abortion rights supporters say they began to notice terms like \"unborn child\" as opposed to \"fetus\" or \"embryo\" in legislation text that was ultimately signed into law; the term is included in 12 of the 13 trigger laws. The use of antiabortion model legislation is not new. In 2019, an investigation from USA Today and the Arizona Republic found AUL was the top group to write legislation limiting abortion access that was introduced and passed in statehouses nationwide. The two organizations have also served as resources for local organizations looking to craft bills. For example, Louisiana's trigger law is not necessarily based on any one model but Louisiana Right to Life uses legal counsel and advice from the national organization, NRLC. Duran said that when drafting model legislation, much of it was aimed at former Justice Anthony Kennedy, who retired in 2018, because he was perceived as the swing vote on the court. \"We were looking at what brand new question could we ask the Supreme Court. And at that time if we're looking at a Kennedy court...we were like, well, let's ask a different question,\" Duran said, adding that the group had a legislation strategy that focused on pain-based arguments in case of a larger lawsuit. Bills like the Pain Capable Unborn Child Act were assumed to get more support from Kennedy than stricter bans. The 13 trigger laws expected to go into effect in coming weeks were all passed by their respective legislatures during two periods: between 2005 and 2007, during the Bush administration, and between 2019 and 2021, during the Trump administration. During both, the Supreme Court gained additional conservative justices. \"It really just depends on the political climate. It depends on what can you get passed and also the legislative strategy,\" Duran said, noting that in the past two decades some states opted for measures that limited access while others chose to pursue trigger laws. Former President Donald Trump campaigned and fulfilled his promise of appointing additional justices and judges who opposed abortion rights. Nash said the two most recent waves of abortion bans happened following the appointments of Justices Brett Kavanaugh, in time for states' 2019 legislative sessions, and Amy Coney Barrett, in time for the 2021 legislative sessions. \"Our strategy was to put more protective language out there to see what can we do and whether it is trying different pieces of legislation like antidiscrimination abortion bills, trying to protect unborn children even earlier in pregnancy,\" Duran said. \"It allowed us to become a little bolder in our ask when we had a more friendlier court...It allowed us to get a little more creative with our laws and seeing just how far can we go to effectively protect unborn children.\" But each of the trigger laws is not necessarily based on a copy-and-paste format of a model bill written by the national groups, with local groups that oppose abortion rights and affiliate with the national organizations having heavier influence. During the first wave of abortion bans between 2005 and 2007, Nash said, legislation was mainly spearheaded by local grassroots efforts. During the consequent wave of bans in 2019 and after, local affiliates continued pressing forward. \"On the one hand, it does mean that what you see coming from states isn't necessarily coming from voters in those states, but it is coming more from anti-abortion groups in those states versus nationally. So each law is more tailored to the conditions in the state,\" said Mary Ziegler, legal historian and law professor at Florida State University. On the other hand, she noted, the national nature of the movement resulted in more moderated measures. \"There was sort of things that even though the movement's agenda was pretty much the same, there were things that weren't said or done because it was viewed as sort of jeopardizing the bigger plan.\" Such provisions could include any law that wouldn't stand against a legal dispute nationally. \"It's a free-for-all one because before there was much more coordination. Americans United for Life and National Right to Life Committee basically coordinated everything,\" Ziegler said. \"You would know which groups to look at and why. And now I think it isn't that way. So which groups are going to dictate? The strategy may depend on the state.\"",

In the wake of the Supreme Court's historic term, some service members and veterans are speaking out. For the first time in her life, Marine Corps Capt. Meleah Martin is refusing to wear American flag attire this Independence Day. Instead, she told her family that she will only wear pride colors and apparel. Not because she's unpatriotic \u2013 she's spent approximately 16 months deployed overseas as an F-18 pilot. But because she believes her constitutional rights are under attack. Martin said it's been disheartening to witness liberties such as the right to protest or to cast a ballot come under attack in recent years. Those frustrations turned to devastation for her with the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, stripping away the constitutional right to an abortion. Martin hopes to someday start a family, but as someone who identifies as a lesbian, she's scared her right to marry and have children may also be in danger. As a result of these fears and frustrations, she said she doesn't look at the American flag the way she used to. \"We swear an oath, 'To support and defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic' ... Well, it's time to start worrying about the domestic, because clearly we have more of a problem here than we do anywhere else,\" Martin said, noting that her views are her own, and not a reflection of her unit or the Marine Corps. \"It's really disappointing when something like this happens, because, like, how do I defend that?\" And she's not alone. The American military and its more than 1 million active-duty troops is traditionally seen as apolitical. But in the wake of a historic Supreme Court term that has shifted the nation to the right on everything from the Second Amendment and abortion, to the separation of church and state, service members and veterans on both sides of the political divide are finding it increasingly difficult to remain quiet. For some, the shifts brought on by the court are cause for celebration. For others, their sentiments amount to a loss of trust and confidence in political leaders, and growing frustration with the country they are sworn to defend.

Before serving as a chairman for the Black Veterans Empowerment Council, Victor LaGroon served as an intelligence analyst in the U.S. Army. His job at the time was to help gather information so that commanders could make methodical choices on the battlefield. He uses the skills he acquired in the Army to better work with politicians in hopes of achieving equal access to benefits and protecting the rights of Black veterans. One of the campaigns he's passionate about is ensuring that Black veterans, as well as their families and communities, have the right to vote. He feels his work is more important than ever, given the growing number of states that have moved to restrict voter access since the 2020 election.

That's the question,\" LaGroon said. \"I'm saddened by what we've become.

Martin has never been one to draw attention to herself. As an active duty member of the military, she's always been careful about sharing her political beliefs with the public in order to maintain her image as an officer. However, she said the Supreme Court's decision to do away with federal abortion protections was the tipping point for her, and compelled her to speak out. Over the years many people have asked her what it's like to be a woman in military aviation, a profession historically dominated by men. But that's never bothered her, because she's always seen her fellow pilots as family. But in the wake of the court's abortion ruling last month, she said can't shake the feeling that she is on uneven ground. \"I've truly felt extremely equal to my peers and I've had a wonderful time in the military, but now, you know, I do I have one less right,\" Martin said. \"And it is a right that has to do directly with my personal body.\" Marine Capt.

Meleah Martin performing preflight inspections on her F-18 aircraft. Martin is concerned not just about her right to get an abortion, but the threat of not being able to marry the woman she loves one day. When it comes to talk of the future, she and her girlfriend often discuss marriage and raising children. And though her partner already has a daughter, the two talk about artificial insemination and who would carry their child. But now she's concerned about what that could look like should a pregnancy put her or her partner's life at risk. Martin is scared she may find herself at a duty station in a state where abortion is outlawed. If she and her partner needed to travel to have an abortion, Martin would need to have a leave request approved by her commanding officer, who might have differing views on the issue. \"I'm not saying that commanders don't have the interests of their sailors and Marines and soldiers in mind. But on, say the worst-case scenario, right, that commander has a very strong belief and is very much against abortion and knows what you're trying to do to take leave, they can just deny your leave without repercussion,\" she said. \"I understand that that is like a very, very severe estimate, right? Or like, that is the worst-case scenario. But it's not necessarily out of the cards.\" An additional fear that weighs on Martin is whether she and her partner will be able to get married in the not-too-distant future. In a concurring opinion to the Supreme Court's abortion ruling, Justice Clarence Thomas wrote that the court's legal rationale in overturning Roe could also be applied to overturn other major cases, including the court's decision to legalize gay marriage. His words shook members of the LGBTQ+ community, including Martin, who now worry that the conservative majority on the high court could strike down their right to marry. \"We thought The Handmaid's Tale was, you know, just an entertaining show, but we're honestly headed back towards that direction, you know what I mean?\" Martin said. \"It's just sad to see.

She has always been against abortion and was glad to see the Supreme Court's decision last month. Although the conversations surrounding abortion are polarizing, she hopes people can come together to talk about it and other important issues. Twenty-three-year-old Natalia Ketcham has two months left on her enlistment with the Coast Guard, after which she plans to attend school to become a dental hygienist. She's originally from Miami, but is stationed outside of San Francisco. Like Martin and LaGroon, she too is concerned about the state of things, albeit for different reasons. Ketcham has been against abortion since she was a pre-teen. Her stance doesn't stem from her Roman Catholic beliefs, she explained, but from her love of life itself. \"I firmly believe that abortion is not a constitutional right, we all have the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, first and foremost, life,\" she said. When the justices voted to return abortion laws to individual states, she was elated. However, as a staunch anti-abortion advocate, she believes there's more work to be done. \"I think that this is a great first step in advancing our generations, our future generations, and I think that's great. But we are nowhere near done,\" Ketcham said. \"So as happy as I am, I am not complacent with where we are at. And I think that's important for pro-lifers to really understand, is that our struggle is not done.\" Ketcham said she stands against abortion across the board, including in cases of rape or incest. Her belief that abortions should be illegal stems from what she sees as an unborn child's right to life, which in her opinion, supersedes the right to an abortion. She's also against the argument that abortion should be legal in instances where the mother may be forced to choose between her life and that of the unborn child. \"If I were put in ... that situation or scenario, I would proudly give up my life for that [of] my child,\" Ketcham said. Instead of funding clinics where abortions are performed, she said she wishes the funds would be redirected towards women's health care, adoption services and child support initiatives. The conversations surrounding abortion are polarizing to say the least, Ketcham admitted, but she also believes they're important conversations to have. She hopes people can come together to talk about issues that are dividing the country to try and bridge a nation divided.

One-in-five of those charged during the attack on the Capitol were veterans, which leaves some veterans worried about how that will affect how the public views them. Investigations into the January 6 attacks revealed that approximately 1-in-5 defendants charged for the siege of the Capitol were veterans, NPR previously reported. LaGroon said the news troubled him because he worried those individuals could be seen by some to be a representation of the veteran population. The thought of veterans across the country joining extremist groups or supporting white supremacy hurts all veterans, LaGroon said, which is why it's important that those who served stand up and speak out. \"If we're not giving people an alternative perspective of who we are, people aren't going to want to hire veterans, they're not going to want us as neighbors, they're not going to want us to marry into their families, they're not going to want to be our classmates in school, because, you know, why? Someone has hijacked our image,\" he said. \"Now we're kind of stuck trying to convey and convince people, 'Oh, no, we're actually better than that.' Are we? Because we got to show it.\" Service members and veterans can be found on both sides of the political spectrum, LaGroon said. But most veterans, he believes, find themselves in the middle, often playing peacekeeper between veterans with strong views on the left and the right. And though it's easier to sit back and remain disheartened about what's taking place across the nation than speak up and risk ridicule, LaGroon said, there's too much at stake to let that happen. \"I think that we have to recognize that we're in the fight, and we have to get in the fight, right? And look, a lot of us are tired, man. You know what I mean?\" LaGroon said. \"We wore the uniform, we came home, we're acclimated \u2014 we got it together somehow \u2014 and we're just trying to enjoy life. And time and time again, thing after thing, we keep seeing our nation needs us more today than it did when we were in uniform.\"",

            "article_content": "President Biden met with a group of Democratic governors on how to protect abortion rights after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: President Biden is looking for actions his administration can take to protect abortion rights now that the Supreme Court has overturned Roe v. Wade. He says Democrats need more seats in Congress to try to enshrine access to abortion into law. Today, he also warned that he thinks restrictions on abortions could increase if his party loses its narrow majority. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: If we don't take - keep the Senate, increase it and the House, we're going to be in a situation where the Republicans are going to pass a nationwide prohibition consistent with what the Supreme Court ruled. SHAPIRO: Today, he met with Democratic governors from nine states about what they are doing. NPR's Barbara Sprunt is covering this story from the White House. Hi, Barbara. BARBARA SPRUNT, BYLINE: Hi, Ari. SHAPIRO: Tell us more about the meeting. What did the president want to talk about? SPRUNT: Well, yesterday, President Biden said he would have announcements today about steps he'll take to protect abortion rights. But really, this was essentially a virtual listening session with governors. He didn't have any new steps to announce today. Reporters were in the room for the start of it. And what we heard was governors explaining what the situation is like in their states. And we heard the president asking them for more ideas. SHAPIRO: We're going to hear from one of those governors in another part of the program. What sorts of ideas did they offer him? SPRUNT: Well, one thing that they urged was to make use of federal and tribal land in states where abortion has been banned, facilities like military hospitals. And that's interesting that they're still asking for that because we had heard earlier this week from the White House that the idea of using federal lands has been ruled out. The governors acknowledged the realities of the situation. They're supportive of abortion rights. And so it's going to be up to them to provide those services for people. And one of those governors was New York's Kathy Hochul. And she talked about the financial burden faced by states who will continue to provide abortion, like hers. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KATHY HOCHUL: The rights of millions of women across this country are now falling on the shoulders of just a handful of states. Just a handful of states are now going to have to take care of the health care of women from other states. SPRUNT: And Biden also talked with North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper. He said his state has already seen an influx of patients coming in for abortion services. He said one provider has scheduled almost 200 patients from out of state just next week. And if you map that out, that's about 10,000 extra patients coming next year from states that have tight restrictions in place. But Biden didn't really indicate what kind of extra help is coming for these states. SHAPIRO: The president has been having a lot of these kinds of meetings, some even before the Supreme Court ruled in this case. What are advocates from around the country telling the Biden administration? SPRUNT: Yeah, there have been dozens of these kinds of meetings at various levels. I spoke with Lupe Rodriguez. She's with the National Latina Institute for Reproductive Justice. She's in California. She's met with the White House in the last few months for these kinds of conversations. And she told me that she's looking to see action on travel vouchers for women who don't have the money to fly or take a train to another state to get abortion care. And she said that's one concrete action that can be taken, but there's a lot more resources that are going to be needed even in states that do have protections in place for abortion. LUPE RODRIGUEZ: Part of the conversation needs to be what resources are being given to states that will have abortion access so that they can support the influx of people and support the people in their own state who need care. SPRUNT: So places like California and New York that have protections in place, the people in those states presumably will continue to seek abortion care at the rates they were before this decision came down. And so now these clinics and providers have to take into account that there's just going to be a lot more people coming from out of state. SHAPIRO: After the Supreme Court ruled, you spoke with abortion rights supporters who had gone to the court, who were frustrated with Democrats and the president for not doing more. How is the White House responding to that criticism? SPRUNT: That's right. I've spoken to voters and advocates who say that they feel, I mean, frankly, abandoned by the White House; people who've told me that they've seen the statements, they've seen the speeches and the interviews, but they want to see President Biden and Vice President Harris out there meeting with women and providers at abortion clinics. Biden has been overseas since the decision was handed down. And the White House is pointing out that this meeting was the first thing he did when he got back. He says he wants to make this a case, that this is an election issue. So to do that, we'll probably see more of these kinds of conversations in the weeks to come. SHAPIRO: That's NPR's Barbara Sprunt reporting from the White House. Thank you. SPRUNT: Thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Wade last Friday, abortion-rights activists continue to fight against laws restricting access to abortion.\n                \n                    \n                    Chandan Khanna/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption In the wake of the overturning of Roe v. Wade last Friday, abortion-rights activists continue to fight against laws restricting access to abortion. Loading... On the morning of May 25, Julie Burkhart got a call that her soon-to-open clinic, Wellspring Health Access, was on fire. The clinic would have become the second in Wyoming to provide abortions and the only one to provide the surgical procedure for people who were past being able to end a pregnancy through pills. The clinic was set to begin patient services on June 13, according to Burkhart. But the destruction made that impossible. Almost immediately, officials concluded that the fire had not been caused by an accident or electrical malfunction. It was arson. A woman \u2014 described as white and wearing jeans, a dark hoodie and a mask \u2014 had broken into the clinic carrying a large red gasoline container and had set the place ablaze. \"It was a terrorist act. There's no other word for it,\" Burkhart told NPR. \"It's heartbreaking but also appalling that someone so recklessly would come in and start a fire when you could almost touch the wall of the apartment building next door where people were sleeping in their beds.\" She added, \"It just showed me that there is this grave disregard for the lives of the people right there in the neighborhood.\" Burkhart notes that the clinic would likely have been in operation for only a few weeks, given what she read in May's leaked Supreme Court draft opinion on Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, a case that last Friday resulted in the overturning of Roe v. Wade. \"We knew with this decision coming down that we probably wouldn't have long, but it would be something,\" she said. It's not lost on Burkhart that the extremist violence of the arson serves as a painful metaphor for the situation that reproductive health advocates currently find themselves in. With every state legislature that passed tight abortion restrictions over the last few decades and with every win by conservatives who gained greater influence over presidents and other elected leaders, it has been like watching a raging fire get closer and closer \u2014 putting innocent people's lives at risk \u2014 and all while equipped with a measly fire extinguisher. That's especially true for abortion-rights supporters in the 13 states that preemptively passed \"trigger laws\" designed to immediately ban or severely limit abortion in the event of Roe's reversal. In the week after six conservative judges undid a half-century of legal protections for people seeking an abortion, NPR spoke with a handful of reproductive rights supporters \u2014 activists, doctors, abortion clinic escorts and women who made the choice to end a pregnancy \u2014 to gauge how they're feeling and what their plans are, moving forward in a post-Roe world. What we found is a group of people bound together by immense grief, frustration and outright fury, but who are all committed to continuing to fight in whatever ways they can. They say the battle over what they believe is the fundamental right of people to choose an abortion is far from over, only now it will be fought in courtrooms and legislatures at the state level. Already they see a few glimmers of hope \u2014 or at least temporary reprieves. As of the publication of this story, a half-dozen states have challenged the new restrictive abortion laws, arguing they are in violation of state constitutions. And some courts have already responded, issuing stays or restraining orders against them. Rachel Marsala, who worked as an abortion clinic escort in Little Rock, Ark., offered advice to discouraged reproductive rights advocates fighting anti-abortion activists: \"We as defenders of choice have to match their energy.

We've got to be ready to show up!\" she said. As an abortion clinic escort in Little Rock, Ark., Rachel Marsala willingly endured months of harassment. The 28-year-old volunteered at Little Rock Family Planning Services for nearly a year, walking pregnant people across the parking lot and into the clinic. During those months, she heard what she described as vile things from the anti-abortion protesters who would gather outside the clinic every day. \"They would say things like, 'Don't kill me, Mama!' \" Marsala said. In the days after the Supreme Court's draft opinion overturning Roe v. Wade was leaked, the protesters became even more aggressive, she said. And last Friday, when the court's official decision came down and Arkansas' trigger ban kicked in, at least one man went from protester to vigilante. \"He was copying down the license plate of every single vehicle that drove in and out of the clinic so he could then turn them in to the police so they could be prosecuted,\" Marsala said. Since last week, abortion is banned statewide, except for cases in which a patient's life is in danger. At the moment, Marsala said, she is focusing on her breathing and remembering to exhale. She's also in therapy, which she recommends for everyone, especially activists like her who may feel defeated over the court's ruling and the people who will suffer as a consequence. \"[Last] Friday, we had to turn away a woman who had rescheduled her procedure because she couldn't afford to pay the first time she came in,\" Marsala said. \"That's just one devastating story.\" She offers this advice for beleaguered reproductive rights advocates fighting anti-abortion activists: \"These people are out there and they are mobilized and they're ready to go. We as defenders of choice have to match their energy. We've got to be ready to show up!\" \u2014 Vanessa Romo Check out KASU and KUAR for more on reproductive rights in Arkansas.

Loren Colson, a physician specializing in family medicine, is worried about the many ways a ban on most abortions in Idaho could risk the health and safety of his patients. He also has legal questions. \"There are just so many scenarios in pregnancy that are not straightforward that the legislators did not think of when they created this law,\" he told NPR, referring to a trigger ban that will likely take effect sometime in August. If it does, it will replace the state's current law, which allows most abortions up to about 24 weeks, with one that will allow abortion only in cases of rape or incest \u2014 so long as the victim can prove they've filed a police report \u2014 or when the pregnant individual's life is at risk. Colson provides \"comprehensive reproductive health care,\" including \"options counseling\" \u2014 that means he talks to patients about ending their pregnancies. He said he's outraged by the burden Idaho's new laws place on victims of assault.  But it's the lack of clarity about what constitutes a \"risk to life\" that he says will likely affect most people seeking an abortion in the future. In many cases, a pregnant individual might have an issue that doesn't put their life in immediate danger but that could be a life-threatening complication later in pregnancy. Should they wait until that happens? he asks. That's the type of complex legal gray area that legislators still need to hash out, Colson said.

Miranda Cisneros frequently participates in protests in Louisville, Ky. But when she heard the news that the Supreme Court had overturned Roe v. Wade, it took her a bit before she was ready to go out. \"When I first heard the news, I was completely numb,\" she told NPR. \"Usually when we hear things, we're just automatically ready to spring into action, but I really had to take a moment,\" she said, adding that by the following day she was \"feeling a lot of anger.\" Much of that anger goes back to the election of Donald Trump, when many people told her she was overreacting, Cisneros said. \"I felt so gaslit in the 2016 election. So many people were telling us that we were overreacting and it was not going to be a big deal, but we're really seeing the aftereffects,\" Cisneros said, in part referring to Trump's legacy, which includes Supreme Court Justices Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett, who all voted to strike down Roe. Kentucky moved swiftly to enact state laws prohibiting nearly all abortions. But on Thursday, a state judge ordered a temporary restraining order on them, allowing abortions to resume for now. When looking at who is going to be most affected by the decision, Cisneros said it is not necessarily the same people, specifically women, who voted for Trump. She said she's worried about the Black, trans and disabled communities. \"I mean, the health care system is already designed to work against disabled folks,\" she said. \"What about disabled folks who now become pregnant? You know, that is also a conversation I think a lot of people aren't having either.\" Cisneros said she wants to see more of these conversations happen. She also wants to see people get uncomfortable and have conversations with their family members or friends, in addition to protesting. \u2014 Wynne Davis For more coverage of reproductive rights in Kentucky, check out Louisville Public Media, Morehead State Public Radio, WKU Public Radio and WKMS.

The 42-year-old New Orleans-based musician and activist says she ran out of tears lamenting conservatives' steady gains against abortion access years ago. \"I shed my tears in 2016,\" she told NPR, adding that loss of abortion rights was the inevitable outcome of Donald Trump's victory in the election that year. With disdain, DeLay added, \"We did this to ourselves as far as the societal thing goes.\" Moments later she continued: \"As a Black woman living in the South, this is nothing new.\" Louisiana's trigger law, which went into effect immediately last Friday following the Supreme Court's decision overturning Roe v. Wade, is now on hold. A state judge has issued a temporary restraining order blocking Louisiana's abortion bans from being enforced. However, if the trigger law does go back to being enforced, it will limit abortion to cases in which the pregnant individual's life is in danger. Anyone who is in violation could face a felony punishable by up to 10 years in prison and a fine of $100,000, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive health research organization that supports abortion rights. For DeLay, it leaves only one path forward: civil disobedience. \"At the end of the day, the Supreme Court depends on society's agreement of this construct, and quite frankly, I have no business or interest in following laws that are unjust and laws that put women in harm's way, especially Black, brown, Indigenous,\" she said. \"I'm talking from my own experiences \u2014 in times when these situations have come up.\" DeLay also said the fight for abortion rights comes down to access. \"No one needs to go and invent the wheel \u2014 look for the helpers and you support them if there needs to be some kind of a setup to get people the access that they need,\" she said. \"At the end of the day, that's what all of this is about.\" \u2014 Shauneen Miranda Head to WWNO for coverage of reproductive rights in Louisiana.

When she became pregnant a second time, she opted for an abortion, explaining that the mental health toll of carrying a pregnancy to term was too much for her to handle. The story of Rebecca Meador's abortion begins with the story of the pregnancy that came before it. When she was 19 years old and living in Mississippi, she gave birth to a baby boy with her then boyfriend, she told NPR. She couldn't afford to raise the baby and she didn't want to have an abortion, so she chose to place the baby for adoption. \"Carrying a child and growing it in your womb, knowing the entire time that you wouldn't be a part of its life, is traumatic and incredibly stressful, and I did the best I could to continue to work and go to school while pregnant,\" she said. She developed severe postpartum depression and agoraphobia following the birth and adoption of her baby boy. That led her to get an abortion a year later when she found out she was pregnant again. \"I knew that I wouldn't survive the possible postpartum depression and agoraphobia again after delivering another baby, and the shadow I lived in of the grief of losing a child to adoption \u2014 being a mother just wasn't an option. It would cost me my life,\" she said. This week, Mississippi Attorney General Lynn Fitch certified the Supreme Court's decision overturning Roe v. Wade. Doing so triggered a state law that bans almost all abortions in Mississippi. It goes into effect this month. Meador now fears that women will have to live through the same pain she did. \"Taking away abortion care is nothing less than violence towards women,\" she said. \"The lack of access to health insurance, the inequality of pay for women, the continued victim blaming when a woman is assaulted and the condemnation of a woman's soul to hell for being in an impossible situation in life are clear indicators of the devaluation of women's lives.\" \u2014 Jaclyn Diaz Head to Mississippi Public Broadcasting for more on the state of reproductive rights in the region.

Dismer is the education and research coordinator at the clinic and a licensed clinical social worker. Before the Supreme Court's decision overturning Roe v. Wade came down, Dismer said it was something that they and many other abortion providers knew was coming \u2014 which is why they started preparing way before last Friday's decision. \"In 2021, we saw patients from 19 different states already, so we're not new to having patients travel from all across the Midwest and South to access care,\" Dismer said. \"We know that's going to get worse.\" Dismer said that a lot of telehealth protocols instituted to mitigate COVID-19  are helping to streamline things today and that the Hope Clinic is working with a Planned Parenthood location in Illinois to better serve the influx of patients. Even so, Dismer said some conversations are still tough as patients go back to their home states and wonder about post-abortion care. \"These are things that, of course, we want you to be honest with your health care providers, if you can. And we acknowledge that sometimes that's not safe,\" Dismer said. Sometimes it's not safe to tell your health care provider that you had an abortion because they may judge you or they may report you or they may compromise the care you're getting. \u2014 Wynne Davis For more on the state of reproductive rights in Missouri, check out the latest from St. Louis Public Radio, KBIA and KCUR.

Instead of picking a place to visit based on an attraction, Haeder's Irish Catholic family chose their destinations based on clinics offering abortion, specifically so they could protest outside them. \"So most of my life I grew up reinforcing the stigma and telling people abortion was wrong,\" Haeder told NPR. \"And then I came to college and I took a women's studies class and I read a bell hooks novel and it changed my life.\" Haeder, who lives in North Dakota, said she realized not everything she grew up learning was what it seemed to be. Then when she found herself pregnant in a brand-new relationship, she decided to get an abortion \u2014 something she never thought she would do. \"I had an abortion here at Red River Women's Clinic, and that was in 2006,\" she said. \"Ever since coming into this clinic and having that abortion care, I wanted to work here.\" Eventually, Haeder got a job as a patient educator and quit her full-time job to work at the clinic. But she didn't stop there. She was inspired to go back to school for a nursing degree. \"Now I am the head nurse here, and I couldn't be more proud of where I'm at or what I do,\" she said. But amid that pride, the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade has been weighing on her. \"Of course, I feel it is a travesty,\" she said. \"If a human being doesn't have autonomy over their own body, how do they have autonomy over their own life?\" \"I'm just thinking about all the women who already have so many obstacles and then to have this one put up is just \u2014 it's like a really big blow and it's really hard to keep emotions in check.\" \u2014 Wynne Davis For more on reproductive rights in North Dakota, head to Prairie Public.

He is also facing two lawsuits in Texas for defying the state law enacted there last year that bans most abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy. Dr. Alan Braid provided abortion care before the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, back when abortion was widely illegal. \"I was an intern in 1972 before Roe and saw injured women and women who died from back alley or botched abortions,\" he explained to NPR. Braid, an OB-GYN, said he must now reconsider his clinic in Tulsa, Okla., after the state's trigger ban. The trigger ban, which comes after a separate Oklahoma anti-abortion law that was at one point the strictest in the nation, now makes it a felony to provide an abortion and includes a penalty of up to five years in prison. The only exception is if the pregnant patient's life is in danger. Braid is not sure what's next for his Oklahoma clinic or his practices in San Antonio, Texas. That's where he currently lives, and there he is facing two lawsuits for performing an abortion in defiance of the state law enacted there last year that bans most abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy. In addition to being sued, he's also suing. \"I've been a part of [opposing] almost every lawsuit challenging the right for women to choose their options,\" he said. At the moment, he's one of several challengers seeking to nullify the Oklahoma ban. But it's clear he's exhausted by the fight he has been waging in the 50 years he has been in reproductive health care. In some respects, it seems a burden has been lifted from his shoulders now that Roe has been overturned, even if it goes against his beliefs. \"I don't want to desert the women in Texas and the people [who] work for me,\" but, he added, he will feel some relief \"not having to worry about the next session of the Texas legislature, which has plagued this state since 1978, when they started passing all the [targeted regulation of abortion providers] laws.\" \u2014 Shauneen Miranda For more on reproductive rights in Oklahoma, check out KOSU, Public Radio Tulsa and KGOU.

Evelyn Griesse traveled to New York to get an abortion decades ago. Now, the abortion-rights activist and co-founder of South Dakota Access for Every Woman faces a new challenge after the state's trigger ban went into effect hours after the Supreme Court's decision overturning Roe v. Wade was announced last Friday. \"We will do the best we can,\" Griesse told NPR. \"We have already been, for years, encouraging and helping women across South Dakota state lines because access has been so limited, so restrictive and so punitive, that there is no reason for us to have any kind of loyalty to this kind of law,\" she said. South Dakota Access for Every Woman has been around since 1985, and last year more than 140 women got abortions with financial help from the organization. She has always felt a duty to the women whose lives were lost in illegal abortions and to the doctors and nonmedical professionals who risked their own lives performing them. \"Women now are still feeling that sense of desperation,\" Griesse noted. \"It is primarily that sense of desperation that continues to go forward in women's lives and that obligation to others before me who gave so much of their energy and their lives to helping women in need,\" she said. Now that South Dakota's trigger ban is in effect, anyone who provides or attempts to provide an abortion will face a felony charge, according to the Guttmacher Institute. There are no exceptions for pregnancies resulting from rape or incest. The only exception to the ban is if the pregnant individual's life is in danger. South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem praised the new ban. \"We have prayed for this day, and now it's here,\" Noem tweeted last Friday, adding that legislators have plans \"for a special session to save lives and help mothers later this year.\" \u2014 Shauneen Miranda Head to South Dakota Public Broadcasting for more on reproductive rights in South Dakota.

Campbell had been inspired by his father, who was an OB-GYN and worked as the medical director of the Knoxville Center for Reproductive Health in Tennessee before experiencing a stroke that ultimately led to his death. With his father gone, Campbell returned to Knoxville to continue the work his father had started. Now, Campbell has taken his place as the director of that same clinic. \"From the perspective of someone who just finished OB-GYN residency right over a year ago, this is going to amount to a public health crisis,\" Campbell told NPR in reference to the Supreme Court's decision overturning Roe v. Wade. \"From the perspective of someone who does this work regularly, it's a disaster and devastating for people who might need these services. And from my personal perspective, it's very disappointing and frustrating.\" Even before the Supreme Court's decision came down, Campbell had started making plans to travel and continue his work in reproductive health care in areas adjacent to those impacted by the decision. He said his goal is to provide safe abortions to those who need and want them. \"The people that are going to be hurt from this decision are not the policymakers or any political elites. The people who are going to get hurt from this are the people who don't have the resources to obtain an abortion elsewhere,\" Campbell said. He is worried about the long-term effects for those who will now be denied access to abortion, including lasting physical and mental health damage, as well as potentially life-long financial consequences. \"So this is not a decision that just affects them in real time. This decision or the denial of that decision truly has long-term consequences not just for their health but for their entire life.\" \u2014 Wynne Davis Head to WPLN for more on reproductive rights in Tennessee.

But despite finding out so early, she was unable to get an abortion under Texas' restrictive SB 8 ban, which is still in place until the state's trigger ban takes effect in the next few weeks. Even before the overturning of Roe v. Wade last week, Adiana Vega knew what it was like to live in a post-Roe world. Texas' restrictive SB 8 law, which prohibits abortion after the detection of embryonic or fetal cardiac activity, or about six weeks into a pregnancy, and which requires several state-mandated interim steps, made it all but impossible for Vega to end her pregnancy in the state, despite the fact that she found out she was pregnant unusually early. \"I was about four weeks,\" the 26-year-old Dallas native told NPR. But even that was too late to get an abortion before the deadline, she explained. While Texas lawmakers have moved to reinstate a nearly century-old abortion ban, a court has issued a temporary restraining order that blocks its enforcement. But that has left SB 8 in place. \"On paper, it sounds like I would have been able to get it, but a pregnant person is mandated to look at their ultrasound and then is required to enter a waiting period,\" Vega said. \"Basically, all of that would have taken more than two weeks. Plus, on top of that, I had COVID at the same time.\" But Vega is among the lucky group of people who have the means and resources to access abortion outside the state. So she called her boyfriend, who lives in Washington, D.C., and together they bought a plane ticket for her to get an abortion at the Planned Parenthood clinic there. \"We get to sweep it under the rug and move on with our lives simply because we have the means to make it go away and then we don't have to talk about it,\" she said, noting that many women who seek abortions are not so fortunate. Vega said when considering where to go, she had to factor in cost, the amount of time she'd have to take off work and where she'd face \"the least humiliating process.\" When she eventually arrived in D.C. \u2014 a place she has always associated with progressive values \u2014 she was stunned to be confronted by the same type of anti-abortion activists she'd seen in Dallas. \"It's just more evidence that there's no place where pregnant people are completely safe,\" she said. \u2014 Vanessa Romo For more on reproductive rights in Texas, check out KUT, KERA, Texas Public Radio and Houston Public Media. \"I've had women who have had abortions in my family, and it was very hush-hush \u2014 it was very secret,\" Angela Romero, a Democratic state representative in Utah, told NPR.\n                \n                    \n                    Angela Romero\n                    \n                \nhide caption \"I've had women who have had abortions in my family, and it was very hush-hush \u2014 it was very secret,\" Angela Romero, a Democratic state representative in Utah, told NPR. Angela Romero, a Democratic state representative in Utah, used to be against abortion. Raised Catholic in the small town of Tooele, Utah, she grew up in an environment in which women were made to feel ashamed of their decision to end their pregnancy. \"I've had women who have had abortions in my family, and it was very hush-hush \u2014 it was very secret,\" she told NPR. Her outlook changed by the time she earned a bachelor's degree in political science at the University of Utah. \"Once I was exposed to just other thoughts and other worldviews, it just really changed the way I view the world,\" she said. As a college student without health insurance, Romero had relied on the services provided by Planned Parenthood. Now, the politician said, she's worried about what will happen if people, especially those in poor and marginalized communities, lose that kind of \"lifesaving\" care under Utah's trigger law banning abortion. The law, which makes inducing an abortion a felony, took effect last Friday, the same day Roe v. Wade was overturned. It has exceptions, including if the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest, though sexual assault victims must report the crime before seeking an abortion. The ban has since been put on temporary hold, however, as courts prepare to hear challenges to the trigger law. Romero noted she's speaking up to ensure that vulnerable women \"are not left behind.\" \"I have women come up to me all the time, saying, 'Thank you for saying what I wish I could say.' \" Romero said no one should need to file a police report to show that they were raped or violated by someone within their family. \"This goes back to trusting women and the decisions they make,\" she said. \"It's problematic for them to jump through all those hoops, and also a person might be in a situation where it's dangerous and they don't want their partner to know that they're seeking an abortion.\" \u2014 Emma Bowman For more on reproductive rights in Utah, check out Utah Public Radio and KUER.

Up until about a month ago, she was on track to open a facility in Wyoming \u2014 a state with only one existing clinic that offers abortion, until a trigger law will likely take effect this month. The planned wellness center had been about two years in the making and was set to begin patient services on June 13. But on May 25, it all turned to ash. \"In the early morning hours, someone broke into the clinic and set it on fire,\" she calmly told NPR. The hope, she said, had been that they'd have at least a few weeks to help women in and around Casper get abortions without having to travel all the way to Jackson, which is about a five-hour drive west of Casper. \"We knew with this decision coming down that we probably wouldn't have long, but it would be something,\" she added. That was before a woman set fire to the clinic. Police have not captured the culprit, but they have released video footage of the suspect \u2014 described as a medium-build white woman about 5 feet, 6 inches tall  \u2014 and are asking the public for help. Meanwhile, a trigger law is poised to be enacted in a few weeks, effectively banning abortion in all circumstances except rape, incest or if the mother is at serious risk of death or injury. Burkhart noted the political shift that has taken place in Wyoming, a traditionally libertarian state. \"Here you've had this small government staying out of people's private lives and their business, and then you fast-forward to when Trump was elected and that is when the real s*** began,\" she said. Looking to the future, Burkhart is determined not to quit. \"We're going to be fighting tooth and nail to provide reproductive health care services in Wyoming,\" she said. \u2014 Vanessa Romo Head to Wyoming Public Media for more on reproductive rights in the state.",

President Biden said he would support changing the filibuster rules in the Senate to ensure that privacy rights, including abortion rights, are enshrined into law in the wake of the historic Supreme Court decision reversing Roe v. Wade. \"I believe we have to codify Roe v. Wade into law and the way to do that is to make sure Congress votes to do that,\" Biden said at a press conference as he wrapped up his overseas trip following G-7 and NATO summits Thursday. \"And if the filibuster gets in the way, it's like voting rights, it should be \u2014 we provide an exception for this, should require an exception to the filibuster for this action, to deal with the Supreme Court decision,\" he said. Biden called out the court for what he said was \"outrageous behavior\" and said he would meet with a group of governors at the White House on Friday on the issue and would make further announcements following the meeting. Under Senate rules, most legislation has to clear a 60-vote threshold. That means that Democrats, who currently control the Senate, do not have enough support on their own to pass legislation. They would need 50 votes to change the filibuster rules, but some Democrats have been reluctant to do so. Republican Senate Leader Mitch McConnell criticized Biden for \"attacking a core American institution like the Supreme Court from the world stage.\" \"He's upset that the court said the people, through their elected representatives, will have a say on abortion policy. That does not destabilize democracy \u2013 it affirms it,\" McConnell said in a statement. \"By contrast, it is behavior like the President's that undermines equal justice and the rule of law.\" In his remarks, Biden doubled down on the administration's messaging that people who are outraged by the Supreme Court decision should mobilize for the November midterm elections. \"Show up and vote, show up in the off-year and vote, vote, vote,\" he said. Asked whether he is the \"best messenger\" to carry the abortion rights message forward, Biden chuckled and said, \"Yeah, I am. I'm the president of the United States of America. That makes me the best messenger.\" President Biden is shown to his chair by NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg at the NATO summit in Madrid on Thursday.\n                \n                    \n                    Jonathan Ernst/POOL/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption President Biden is shown to his chair by NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg at the NATO summit in Madrid on Thursday.

The admission path for the two countries \u2014 which Biden noted have a \"long tradition of neutrality\" \u2014 was cleared after Turkey dropped its objections. \"[Putin] wanted the Finland-ization of NATO.

            "article_content": "Vice President Harris responds to Roe v. Wade being overturned by the Supreme Court. She says abortion-rights supporters need to channel their disappointment into political action ahead of midterms.  RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: Vice President Kamala Harris has taken a leadership role in the White House's response to the Supreme Court's decision to reverse abortion rights. It's part of a long career of working on issues around protection of women and girls. She sat down with NPR's Asma Khalid as part of the NPR Politics Podcast to talk more about her fight ahead. ASMA KHALID, BYLINE: I began our interview by asking the vice president to respond to criticism from the left that there is not this sense of urgency from this White House about protecting abortion rights. VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: There is no daylight among us who understand the seriousness of this moment and the real consequence to millions of women and those who love them around our country. Now, the question becomes, what can we do? KHALID: And that's where... HARRIS: And what should we do? KHALID: ...I guess, you know, some of these women are saying, well, why not be out in the streets? Why not be out, you know... HARRIS: Well, but that's... KHALID: ...Meeting with women? Yeah. HARRIS: ...Exactly - all of these things need to happen. All of these things need to happen. We need to stand up and speak loudly about why this is something that we will fight against. And part of that fight has to include understanding that the court has now acted, and now we're going to need Congress to act. And that means passing legislation that, as we say, codifies Roe, which means let's put it into law so it is beyond debate. KHALID: She also said there's a lot more at risk beyond abortion. HARRIS: I think that the right to privacy that extends to allowing an individual to make decisions about whether they will start a family, including the access to in-vitro fertilization, is arguably now at risk. I believe the right to privacy that was an extension of our, finally, correct decision in Obergefell to allow same-sex marriage - I do believe that is now at risk. So let's understand that this court has, in many ways, opened up analysis and arguments that all of these things are on the table. And, again, you only need look at Clarence Thomas' concurring opinion to know that that's the case. KHALID: And so what do you do as Democrats? HARRIS: Well, I think what we do - yeah. KHALID: I mean, do you think it ought to be codified? HARRIS: I... KHALID: Do you want that to... HARRIS: Well, I think what we do is a number of things. First and foremost, we understand that there are many things that we have long taken for granted - in the case of same-sex marriage, not as long - but that we have taken for granted and assumed to be the indications of progress in our country that we actually have now learned we may not be able to take for granted. So we stand up, and we are clear about what we are not willing to accept and what we will fight for. KHALID: But she stopped short of saying whether Democrats in Congress should actually bring that legislation up immediately, and she didn't want to talk about the filibuster. That's the 60-vote threshold that most pieces of legislation need to pass in the Senate. I also asked her, aside from congressional action, are there any changes this White House would consider proposing to change the makeup of the Supreme Court? She reiterated that the president is opposed to expanding the Supreme Court, and she would not engage on the idea of term limits. She had really one main message. HARRIS: I personally think we need to win the midterms (laughter). If you were to - if you're asking me to reduce it to one issue, but it is not only one issue. But if you want to know what I think is one of the greatest charges right now - because after 130-something days, we would have lost an opportunity to potentially change the configuration of the United States Congress. KHALID: A hundred and thirty-two days till Election Day in November - that is the window for Harris and Democrats to make the case that they have a strategy - not just to win seats in Congress, but also a plan on how exactly they intend to cement abortion rights into law.

PARIS \u2014 The new speaker of France's lower house of parliament \u2014 the first woman to hold the post \u2014 vigorously defended the right to abortion Tuesday and called on the chamber to be \"vigilant\" about protecting it from reversal. The National Assembly elected Yael Braun-Pivet as speaker on Tuesday, in its first session since President Emmanuel Macron's party lost his majority in elections this month that handed new power to far-right and far-left camps. Braun-Pivet is a member of Macron's centrist alliance Ensemble (Together), which still has the most seats in the Assembly but no longer enough to comfortably adopt laws. The assembly is France's most powerful house of parliament. The divided chamber is preparing to tackle proposals on fighting inflation and enshrining abortion rights in the French Constitution, in response to the U.S. Supreme Court decision last week to strip women's constitutional protections for abortion. Abortion in France was legalized in 1975 and has broad political support. \"The brutal decision handed down last Friday by the U.S. Supreme Court, that reversed its commitment, that shocked us so much, is a stark reminder to be vigilant,\" Braun-Pivet said after becoming speaker. \"Nothing should be taken for granted. History is made of great progress but is always under threat of being reversed. This right was fought for and was inalienable. It is my conviction as a woman today is that we need to be the watchdog so that it stays in place forever,\" she told lawmakers. Braun-Pivet is a former Socialist who joined Macron's party in 2016 and a relative newcomer to law-making. She was chosen by secret ballot over candidates from rival parties. The leftist Nupes coalition is the biggest opposition force in the Assembly, and its legislators made a grand joint entrance Tuesday with a diverse cross-section of lawmakers including many young people in office for the first time. Nupes hopes to challenge Macron's plans to cut taxes and raise the retirement age from 62 to 65. The far-right party of three-time presidential candidate Marine Le Pen, the National Rally, won a record number of seats, and is expected to press anti-immigration policies. All three top parties plan competing measures aimed at helping working-class households cope with high inflation, fueled by Russia's war in Ukraine. Women remain in the minority in the Assembly, and Braun-Pivet's appointment was seen as sending an important message about women in politics. A lawyer who spent several years living in Asia, Braun-Pivet was elected first in 2017 and reelected this month in her district west of Paris, and chaired the Assembly's Law Committee for the past five years. The National Assembly is taking on a more important role now than it has had in 20 years. Macron's supporters worry that the new legislature will cause political gridlock and block his efforts to make France's economy more business-friendly and pass climate legislation. His critics say it is more representative of France. \"The French people compel us to work together, to debate rather than to fight each other. They've chosen us, they've elected us and we share, whatever our differences, a responsibility to answer to this assembly which is the face of France,\" Braun-Pivet said. National Rally legislator Sebastien Chenu said his far right party would push for debate on \"Islamism\" and immigration. \"We will oppose without any concessions Emmanuel Macron's reforms, like the pension reform in particular,\" he said. Amid high inflation, Nupes legislator Louis Boyard said, \"We must revive the economy through consumption. By raising the minimum wage to 1,500 euros. By freezing prices. We have plenty of proposals.\" As lawmakers paraded through the garden toward the columned assembly, two deputies from French Polynesia arrived wearing traditional attire. The assembly, however, remains largely a place of suits and ties. The National Assembly will choose committee leaders in the coming days, and either Nupes or the National Rally may win control of the important finance commission, which is in charge of controlling the state's budget. Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne \u2013 only the second woman to hold that post \u2013 will lay out the government's overall goals in a broad speech next week, and may face a confidence vote soon afterward.",

On Monday, abortion rights advocates filed a lawsuit arguing that the Kentucky state constitution protects the right to abortion.\n                \n                    \n                    Jon Cherry/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Abortion rights protesters in Louisville, Ky., after the Supreme Court announced it had voted to overturn Roe v. Wade. On Monday, abortion rights advocates filed a lawsuit arguing that the Kentucky state constitution protects the right to abortion. For decades, the legal battle over abortion focused on the U.S. Supreme Court and its guiding document, the U.S. Constitution. Now, with Roe v. Wade overturned, the legal spotlight has shifted to the states, where abortion supporters and opponents must contend with 50 different constitutions that, in many places, guarantee rights more broadly than their federal counterpart. The legal chaos has already begun. In a half-dozen states and counting, lawsuits argue that new restrictive abortion laws are in violation of state constitutions. So, too, the stakes have grown for ballot measures scheduled this year to amend those constitutions, whether to protect the right to an abortion or eliminate it. \"For anyone who thought, 'Oh, Roe v. Wade is done and now this whole thing is over' \u2014 I have bad news,\" Mary Ziegler, an abortion law expert at the University of California Davis, tells NPR. \"This is just going to be an even more complicated chapter that we're entering into.\" And experts say the uncertainty could continue for years to come, given the relative ease of amending state constitutions and the judicial elections in many states that can result in rapid changes to a court's ideological makeup. In the days since the Dobbs decision, abortion rights organizations have filed lawsuits challenging state courts to find a right to abortion in at least four states, including Utah, Kentucky, Idaho and Mississippi. (Some other active legal challenges, including lawsuits in Wisconsin, Louisiana and Texas, do not ask judges to evaluate the constitutionality of abortion rights. Rather, they point to administrative errors or other enforceability questions as reasons for judges to invalidate the laws.) #MISSISSIPPI: We have filed a lawsuit on behalf of Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization to prevent Mississippi from enforcing its trigger ban, which would prohibit nearly all abortions in the state. As of right now, abortion remains legal in Mississippi. #AbortionIsEssential They join two lawsuits in Florida and Michigan that were filed in anticipation of Roe being overturned. At question in Michigan is a nearly-century-old abortion ban that had long gone unenforced. In Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a law in April that would ban abortions after 15 weeks. It has since been challenged by Planned Parenthood, which has asked a judge to block the law before it takes effect at the end of the week. All of the legal challenges emphasize the disruptions to a person's life and the risks to their health and economic security that come with pregnancy and childbirth. But the lawsuits are not identical. Each appeals to specific lines of legal theory unique to each state, citing different state provisions and different case histories to support their arguments. In Utah, Planned Parenthood's suit argues that the state's trigger ban violates seven different sections of the Utah state constitution. A judge has temporarily blocked Utah's abortion ban as a result of the lawsuit \u2014 allowing abortions there to resume for 14 days. The Idaho lawsuit points to a history of legal decisions by the Idaho Supreme Court that advocates say indicate a right to \"intimate familial decisions,\" including procreation. In Kentucky, the ACLU has appealed to that state's legal traditions of privacy and self-determination. BREAKING: We\u2019re suing Kentucky in state court to stop two extreme abortion bans.Since the Supreme Court\u2019s decision, abortion has been effectively banned in Kentucky, and people have been forced to remain pregnant against their will or flee the state. And in Mississippi, Jackson Women's Health Organization \u2014 the abortion clinic at the center of the Dobbs case \u2014 filed a new lawsuit Monday. \"Mississippians still have a separate and independent right to privacy under the Mississippi Constitution that the Mississippi Supreme Court held encompasses a right to abortion,\" the lawsuit states, citing a 1998 decision by the state court that remains legally binding, the clinic's lawyers argue. Like the U.S. Constitution, no state's constitution explicitly includes a right to abortion (or other reproductive rights, like the use of birth control). But many describe rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Others demand equal protection under the law. And unlike the U.S. Constitution, 11 states explicitly guarantee a right to privacy, an important legal underpinning of the original Roe decision in 1973. \"There's all kinds of generally phrased provisions in state constitutions that can be used to anchor litigation,\" said John Dinan, a professor of politics at Wake Forest University. State constitutions vary so widely that legal decisions by their supreme courts don't always align with a state's predominant political ideology, experts said. Courts in conservative states like Montana and Tennessee, for example, have struck down laws designed to limit abortions through imposing waiting periods or onerous regulations for clinics. Another example is Florida, said Ziegler, where a privacy clause was added to the state constitution in 1980. \"Ever since then, Florida has had fewer abortion restrictions than you would have expected because of that state's constitutional provision,\" she said.

Planned Parenthood has filed suit to challenge Idaho's trigger ban. In the 2000s, anti-abortion activists vexed by state supreme courts began to turn to a simple solution: Amend the constitutions to explicitly eliminate the right to abortion. State constitutions are generally much easier to change than the federal Constitution. Once a state legislature has proposed an amendment, most states require only a simple majority of voters to approve it. (Voters have amended their state constitutions more than 700 times since 2006, according to Ballotpedia. By contrast, no effort to amend the U.S. Constitution \u2014 which requires a two-thirds vote in the House and Senate, along with ratification by 38 states \u2014 has been successful in decades.) In 2014, Tennessee became the first state in the nation to enact an amendment that expressly declared no right to abortion in the state's constitution. Alabama, West Virginia and Louisiana have since followed suit. In August, voters in Kansas will become the first to consider such an amendment in a post-Dobbs political reality. Kentucky will vote on another in November. In Kansas, the state's supreme court voted in 2019 to find a right to abortion in the state constitution's \"life, liberty and pursuit of happiness\" clause. That ruling remains in effect today \u2014 meaning abortion is legal in Kansas despite Dobbs. That could change if voters approve the amendment in August. Now, abortion rights advocates are turning to the amendment solution, too. Four states and the District of Columbia have already codified the right to abortion throughout pregnancy, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that advocates for abortion access. That includes New Jersey and Colorado, which passed those measures earlier this year. In Vermont, voters in November will consider a first-of-its-kind constitutional amendment guaranteeing \"personal reproductive autonomy.\" On Monday, in the wake of the Dobbs decision, legislators in California approved a similar ballot measure to put to voters in November. An abortion rights group in Michigan backed by the ACLU, is working to gather enough signatures to do the same there. While the U.S. Supreme Court justices have lifetime appointments, state courts can change much more rapidly, experts note. High court judges in 38 states are subject to elections, according to the Brennan Center \u2014 whether they are elected directly by voters, or appointed initially then later face retention votes. In many states, partisan governors or legislatures appoint judges. \"This is all going to be very much in flux and very much open to popular influence and popular votes in elections,\" Dinan said. \"You can have one state supreme court voted in. Then several years later, it can change.\" Look at Iowa, he said, where this month the state supreme court overturned a ruling from just four years ago that had outlined a broad right to abortion. Since the original ruling in 2018, the state's Republican governor, Kim Reynolds, was able to replace four of the court's seven judges, opening the door for a new decision. No matter which view of abortion voters may take, the new focus on state constitutions heightens the importance of voting in state elections. According to Ballotpedia, nearly 90 state supreme court seats are on the ballot this year. \"States have been doing this the whole time, and the stakes have been higher than most Americans realize,\" Ziegler said. \"I think this is something that's probably overdue in terms of people paying more attention and understanding the importance of state constitutions for the rights we have.\"",

After the Supreme Court's decision overturning Roe v. Wade was announced on Friday, a visibly angry House Speaker Nancy Pelosi stepped before the cameras to rail against a decision that she described as devastating in its consequences and a first step toward criminalizing health freedom for women. It was a defeat decades in the making, as abortion-rights supporters steadily lost ground in the federal courts and failed to halt reproductive restrictions that bubbled up at the state level. \"We took our eye off the ball,\" acknowledges Melissa Murray, a constitutional law professor at New York University School of Law. Murray, who teaches courses on family law and reproductive rights, says progressives responded inadequately to a well-coordinated effort by conservatives playing the \"long game.\" With abortion already banned in at least seven states and more than a dozen others expected to either prohibit or severely restrict the practice in the coming weeks, progressives are being forced to confront their missteps in the defense of Roe as they assess how to move forward on abortion rights and other issues in the wake of the court's landmark decision last week in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization. What occurred was \"a failure to fight on a lot of different fronts,\" Murray says. The overturning of Roe was, in large measure, the pinnacle of a methodical and highly effective conservative strategy patiently carried out over the past half-century. Murray points to the gradual stacking of the Supreme Court in favor of conservatives and state laws severely restricting abortion. But equally important was \"an inattentiveness to the lower federal courts\" on the part of progressives \u2014 as these courts were routinely upholding state-level anti-abortion legislation, Murray says. To that list, Murray adds an erosion of voting rights that made it more difficult for women of color \u2014 likely the group most affected by the reversal of Roe \u2014 to have a say at the ballot box. Samuel Lau, a spokesperson for Planned Parenthood Federation of America, concurs. \"Disenfranchising people, gerrymandering voters out of meaningful representation, confirming federal judges with records hostile to civil and reproductive rights, and instituting undemocratic voting restrictions is in large part how we arrived here \u2014 especially when you look at the erosion of abortion rights on the state levels,\" he says.

She points to the 2018 fight over the Mississippi law at the center of the Supreme Court's decision in the Dobbs case. At the time, a proposed law in the state, which has since stalled, would have made it easier to register to vote. Many Black women see a connection between voting rights and efforts to end abortion, Murray says. But instead of fighting on both fronts, abortion-rights activists remained focused solely on abortion. \"I don't want to criticize any particular organization, but I will just say I don't think there was much of an effort until quite recently to think of all of these things as threats that worked in concert,\" she says. \"There's abortion and, you know, the women's groups are lined up on this. And then there's the voting, and the minority groups are lined up on this,\" she says. \"And then there's free speech, and these groups are lined up on that when, in fact, they're inextricably linked and impositions on one have ripple effects on the others.\" Michelle Col\u00f3n, the co-founder and executive director of SHERo Mississippi, an abortion-rights group, says among abortion-rights advocates, there has been a long-standing lack of cohesion. Activists in places such as California, New York and Washington, D.C., were not very concerned about what was happening in red states, such as Mississippi, according to Col\u00f3n. \"People still cared about Texas and Florida because they had ... the electoral votes that were in double digits,\" she says. However, \"as long as it stayed below the Mason-Dixon Line in states that had nothing to offer politically [to] the national Democratic Party ... mainstream organizations didn't care.\" This made it easier, she says, for abortion opponents to seed cases in the courts that would chip away at reproductive rights first and then ultimately prompt the end of Roe altogether. Carol Sanger, a professor at Columbia Law School, says it is also important not to discount the anti-abortion movement's deep pockets. Thanks to donors such as the billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch, there was no lack of funding, she says. \"That's a failure of the progressives not to have had [their] own Koch brothers,\" Sanger says. \"[But] I don't know how you get [your] own Koch brothers.\" In an email to NPR, a spokesman for the Koch network said the organization does not work on the issue of abortion. Andrea Miller, president of the National Institute for Reproductive Health (NIRH), agrees. \"This really was about the degree of funding and diligence and focus,\" she says. The anti-abortion rights campaign \"had multiple layers and was exceedingly well funded and well executed,\" Miller says. \"That's really where the blame should lie. [Abortion opponents] were very clear about their goals. They were incredibly determined and refused to ever give any ground,\" she says. Funding from big donors helped fuel legal challenges brought by anti-abortion groups and pushed Republican nominees to the federal bench, including the Supreme Court. In 2016, Senate Republicans led by then-Majority Leader Sen. Mitch McConnell, citing the nearness of the presidential election, took the unprecedented step of refusing to consider then President Barack Obama's nomination of Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court. In relatively quick succession came the 2018 retirement of Justice Anthony Kennedy, once a key swing vote on the court, and the death of liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in 2020. Together, these events, Sanger says, were \"almost impossible to overcome.\" Despite strong headwinds facing his judicial nominees, Obama deserves \"some blame\" for not being more aggressive in pushing them through, she says. Thanks to McConnell, former President Donald Trump got three Supreme Court appointments, giving conservatives a 6-3 majority: Instead of Garland, it was Neil Gorsuch; Kennedy was succeeded by Brett Kavanaugh; and Ginsburg was replaced by Amy Coney Barrett. Barrett's nomination was confirmed just days before the 2020 presidential election, despite McConnell's earlier objections to the timing of hearings on Garland's nomination. It was at the moment when Barrett's nomination was confirmed that the eventual overturning of abortion protections seemed all but certain, says Mary Ziegler, a professor of law at Florida State University and the author of several books on Roe v. Wade. Many supporters of abortion rights say the Obama administration failed to act aggressively enough to confirm Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court, despite a Republican blockade in the Senate. The failed nomination would come back to haunt Democrats.\n                \n                    \n                    Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Many supporters of abortion rights say the Obama administration failed to act aggressively enough to confirm Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court, despite a Republican blockade in the Senate. The failed nomination would come back to haunt Democrats. Despite the conservative gains and the missteps of progressives, \"there was no moment when it became inevitable really until Amy Coney Barrett joined the court,\" she says. Before that time, there were no guarantees for either side. \"This is a case of conservatives doing a lot of things right [and] progressives doing things wrong,\" Ziegler says. Case in point, conservatives rallied voters around the idea of capturing the courts and using them to fight battles they were having trouble winning in the states and in Congress. By contrast, progressives did a poor job of grassroots organization, Ziegler says, by largely failing to convince voters that the courts are \"an issue that you should care about, that control of the courts was something you needed to worry about.\" The NIRH's Miller also concedes that the messaging could have been better. \"I actually think 'safe, legal and rare' was a mistake,\" she says, referring to a slogan picked up by then-candidate Bill Clinton in 1992. There was never any reason to stigmatize abortion, Miller says. \"The reality is that there has always been a need for abortion, regardless of whether it's legal or not.\" So, where do abortion-rights advocates go from here? Any federal law protecting abortion would be difficult or impossible to pass \u2014 and would be nearly certainly struck down in light of Dobbs. An executive order from President Biden would likely suffer the same fate. \"It's going to be much harder for conservatives to enforce bans on abortion than to pass them,\" Ziegler notes. \"So one thing progressives are going to do, and I imagine probably do fairly successfully, is just say, 'OK, this is the law on the books in the state, but good luck enforcing it.'\" Finding an acceptable approach to enforcement is already proving a challenge in some states with newly enacted anti-abortion laws, such as Utah and Texas, where courts have temporarily blocked abortion bans from taking effect.

The Supreme Court's decision to end constitutional protections for abortion has cleared the way for states to impose bans and restrictions on abortion \u2014 and has set off a series of legal battles.\n                \n                    \n                    Rick Bowmer/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption People attend an abortion-rights protest at the Utah State Capitol on Friday in Salt Lake City.

Meanwhile, a majority of Americans have consistently supported abortion rights and, according to an NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist National Poll that came out on Monday, that still holds. Progressives \"have some advantages,\" Ziegler says. \"Namely that this is not a decision that's in line with popular opinion, including in some red states.\" The states are likely to be the prime battleground for abortion-rights advocates moving forward, Miller says. \"The path forward really is through the states,\" she says. \"I believe that that is really the place where if greater attention had been paid, perhaps we wouldn't have seen quite the tsunami in 2018 or the number of bills restricting access to abortion and now banning abortion.\"",

            "article_content": "Vice President Harris has a long history working on reproductive rights. NPR's Asma Khalid talks with her about what the White House will do now that the Supreme Court has overturned 'Roe v. Wade.'  JUANA SUMMERS, HOST: The Supreme Court decision eliminating the constitutional right to an abortion has shaken the Democratic Party. Activists are looking for answers on how the White House plans to fight back, and NPR White House correspondent Asma Khalid sat down with Vice President Kamala Harris today to talk about all of this. Asma Khalid joins us now. Hey, Asma. ASMA KHALID, BYLINE: Hi there, Juana. SUMMERS: So activists are calling on the White House to use the full force of the executive branch to protect and defend abortion access. Did you ask the vice president about that? KHALID: I did, Juana. In fact, that is exactly where I started our conversation. One of the criticisms that we have been hearing from folks on the left within the Democratic Party is, you know, the White House is telling people to vote more, but why are we not seeing you out at abortion clinics meeting with women? VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: Well, I have been at this very table, so I think - but let's talk about it, if we can just back up for a moment, in terms of what this means. And I want to make that point to make an equally important point, which is that we have to stand together in this fight - right? - those of us who understand what's at stake. This is the first time in the history of our country that the United States Supreme Court has taken a constitutional right that was recognized, taken from women the ability to make decisions about their own body, has, in effect, rendered an opinion that suggests that a woman will have to have and carry to term a pregnancy that she doesn't want. It's an extraordinary thing what has just happened in terms of the significance to the essential principles, the - essential to our nation and its founding, of freedom, of liberty, the right to privacy. It is profound in terms of where it takes us back. You know, we have a 23-year-old daughter who is going to know fewer rights than my 80-something-year-old mother-in-law. That's profound. KHALID: And you know, Juana, she, like President Biden, say what really needs to happen is that Congress needs to put abortion protection into law. SUMMERS: But on Capitol Hill, the reality is that Democrats don't have the votes now. Did you press her on how that can happen? KHALID: I did. And, you know, we went back and forth because I did want to get clarity on how exactly this could happen. She talked about a bill that would have done that that failed to pass the 60-vote threshold in the Senate earlier this year. HARRIS: We right now have a Senate where there are - It's an even split of Democrats and Republicans, 50/50. I sat in the chair presiding over the United States Senate when the vote came up for the Women's Protection Act. And the votes were not there. Not one Republican voted. Not one Republican voted in favor of passing legislation to protect a woman's right to make decisions over her own body. And so that's where the votes are right now. We have a midterm coming up in 100 and - I think it's, as of today, 133 days, a midterm which could decide the balance of the United States Congress, both on the Senate side and on the House side. And knowing that we now - the court has acted in the way that it did, we now know the place where the protection is going to happen to reinstate those protections has to be through law, and that's through Congress. So part of what we need to do is we cannot underestimate the significance of the upcoming elections and the need for all people who care about this issue to understand that we have to have a pro-choice Congress to pass this law. KHALID: So I want to make sure that I can understand what you're saying, though. So you're saying that there wasn't Republican support for this legislation? But then... HARRIS: There was not. There was literally not. KHALID: But why not push for overturning the filibuster, in that case, if - knowing that you're not going to have the Republicans? HARRIS: You still need the votes to overturn the filibuster, and the votes don't exist. KHALID: Do you individually support that idea, though? Let's say you don't have the votes. HARRIS: Why are we talking about hypotheticals? The votes don't exist. What I support - let me tell you what I support. I support electing a pro-choice Congress to get the votes to pass the legislation to put into law a protection for women of America to make decisions about their own body without government interference. And so I'm not going to engage in spending time talking about something that actually is not going to happen right now because the votes just don't exist. But what I do know can happen right now - what I do know can happen right now is that over the course of the next 130-something days, we, through the electoral process, have the opportunity, the possibility, dare I say the imperative, of looking at these races. Look at the Senate race in Georgia. Look at the Senate race in North Carolina. Look at the Senate race that's happening soon in Colorado, and understand the levers that we have to move. KHALID: And, Juana, I will say, I kept pressing her on this issue of the filibuster, which, you know, of course, is the 60-vote threshold needed for most legislation. I do want to make sure that I understand clearly, though, what it means to say Roe is on the ballot this November because if it's not a practical thing to talk about eliminating, you know, blowing up the filibuster right now, then is it that you need 10 more... HARRIS: Well, we just don't have the - but it's not - it's not that it's not - listen, that is a legitimate conversation - OK? - about the filibuster. So that's not what I mean to suggest. KHALID: OK. HARRIS: What I am saying, however, is that given the current composition of the United States Senate, it's not going to happen. SUMMERS: Asma, you've covered her for some time now. What struck you from this interview? KHALID: My takeaway, Juana, is that even if Democrats want to change the current filibuster rules to make abortion legal through Congress, they need more Democrats to do that. And so that is why they are putting all their efforts into the midterms. SUMMERS: That's NPR's Asma Khalid. You can hear more of her interview with the vice president on the NPR Politics Podcast.

Harris noted that other rights \u2013 including same-sex marriage and contraception \u2013 could be at risk because of the Supreme Court decision, but stopped short of saying that Senate Democratic leadership should bring forth legislation to federally codify those rights. \"I think this is an opportunity to coalition-build - an opportunity to bring under one roof all the folks who understand what's at stake right now,\" she said. \"If you take it as a Venn diagram, the part of the circle that is about attacks on voting rights, the circle that is about the attacks against the LGBTQ community, and the circle that is the attacks on a woman's right to choose, it's really interesting to see the overlap of those circles.\" Harris declined to engage on the idea of term limits for Supreme Court justices, noting President Biden had been clear that he doesn't favor expanding the court. \"I personally think we need to win the midterms,\" she said. Reproductive rights is not the only intractable issue that Harris has been assigned since taking office. One of the first issues in her portfolio was finding ways to address the root causes of migration to the U.S. southern border. Khalid asked Harris about the tragic news that at least 50 people died, trapped in a tractor trailer in San Antonio on Monday. Harris said that the tragedy should prompt change, but also noted that political leaders need to act \u2013 and that Congress had not moved on immigration reforms \"because they're playing political games.\" Vice President Kamala Harris in her ceremonial office in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building.\n                \n                    \n                    Cheriss May for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Vice President Kamala Harris in her ceremonial office in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building.",

Kevin Stitt has won the Republican primary for governor and the State Superintendent of Public Instruction, Joy Hofmeister, has won the Democratic primary for governor, according to race calls from The Associated Press. Hofmeister flipped her party affiliation from Republican to Democrat last fall claiming Stitt had hijacked her former party. She has criticized Stitt's handling of the pandemic and referred to his leadership as divisive and ineffective. The governor, endorsed by former President Donald Trump, has largely held to familiar party lines on guns, abortion and more. Even in a ruby red state where more than half of voters are registered Republicans and just a third are registered Democrats, Hofmeister is expected to give Stitt some competition in the general election. Stitt has also touted that he would sign every bill in opposition to abortion that came to his desk and he's arguably done that. In May, he signed into law a bill that was deemed at the time as the most restrictive abortion bill in the country, which effectively banned all abortions beginning at fertilization. But Stitt's administration has come under fire over the misspending of pandemic relief funds, accusations of improper pressure put upon the state's pardon and parole board and a scandal involving a local barbecue chain operating restaurants at state parks.

The state Assembly voted Monday to amend Article 1 of the California Constitution to say, \"The state shall not deny or interfere with an individual's reproductive freedom in their most intimate decisions, which includes their fundamental right to choose to have an abortion and their fundamental right to choose or refuse contraceptives.\" Midterm elections are Nov. 8. The bill passed the state Senate last Monday, and does not need the governor's approval. The amendment comes three days after the U.S. Supreme Court reversed the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade case, which made abortion a constitutional right across the nation. Almost half of America's 50 states are expected to outlaw abortion, but California Gov. Gavin Newsom said he has no plans to do so. \"Abortion is legal in California. It will remain that way,\" he tweeted. \"We will not cooperate with any states that attempt to prosecute women or doctors for receiving or providing reproductive care.\" California Senate President Toni Atkins and Assembly Member Anthony Rendon introduced the legislation shortly after the court's decision was leaked in May. Planned Parenthood Affiliates of California is listed as a co-sponsor of the legislation. \"Abortion is health care, and should be a private discussion between a patient and their health care provider,\" Atkins said. \"When politicians and judges force themselves into that room, safety goes out the window.\"",

In others, including Michigan, bans from before Roe had never been taken off the books, and may take effect again. Gov.

Advocates are also pushing for a ballot measure in the fall that would enshrine the right to an abortion in the state constitution.

Unfortunately that's being appealed.... \"Today, women still have access to full reproductive health care in Michigan. However, should that injunction fall, we would revert back to a 1931 law that would make it a felony; no exceptions for rape or incest.\" Medical providers are worried the impact will extend beyond Roe v. Wade \"It's not just abortion in the traditional sense \u2014 it's IVF, it's any procedure OB-GYNs do regularly to protect women, to preserve their ability to reproduce in the future, to empower women to make their own health care decisions. So there's a lot of confusion in the medical establishment, there's a lot of confusion that women in our families are feeling. It's a terribly anxious time right now for all of us.\" On government warnings that the ruling could spur political violence \"This has been on my mind since the Trump administration, where people felt entitled to threaten my life, and threaten the lives of public health officials, threaten lives of people who disagree with them. That's not who we are, that's not how this democracy is supposed to operate. And I do think that the Supreme Court's recent decisions have made America a more dangerous place. And I'm worried about that.\"",

Kathy Hochul speaks during the New York State Democratic Convention. June's primary calendar comes to a close on Tuesday with five states holding key contests: New York, Oklahoma, Colorado, Illinois and Utah. Meanwhile, Mississippi and South Carolina are holding runoffs. Voters in the Empire State will be picking their candidates for governor come November, potentially setting the stage for the first female elected governor in the state's history. And redistricting will have an effect in states like Illinois, where two pairs of incumbents will go head to head for a shot at reelection. Here are some key races to watch: Current New York Gov. Kathy Hochul is vying to be the first female elected to the state's highest office. Hochul, then the lieutenant governor, became governor following former Gov. Andrew Cuomo's resignation. Running in her party to oust her is U.S. Rep. Tom Suozzi and New York City Public Advocate Jumaane Wiliams. Hochul has led the pack in fundraising, topping $30 million, and is doubling down on key issues including implementing a gas-tax reduction through the end of the year and a series of gun-control and abortion-access measures she signed into law just this month. But she has also faced blowback from her Democratic opponents for being formerly associated with the National Rifle Association and after her lieutenant governor was arrested on federal bribery charges and resigned. The GOP lineup to challenge her in November is also full. Rep. Lee Zeldin, former Westchester County Executive Rob Astorino, businessman Harry Wilson and Andrew Giuliani, a former Trump administration aide who is the son of former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, are all pushing to be on the ballot this fall. Read more from WNYC. The Oklahoma primary will feature a special election to replace GOP Sen. Jim Inhofe, who announced his retirement earlier this year. Multiple Republican candidates have entered the contest hoping to take over his seat. The ballot includes former Trump administration Environment Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt and Inhofe's current chief of staff Luke Holland. Others include a state senator and a state representative, a family medicine physician and Jessica Jean Garrison, who opted to not take donations. Holland has Inhofe's endorsement. Oklahoma's second Senate seat is also up for election. Incumbent Republican Rep. James Lankford is leading the pack in terms of fundraising and spending. He faces Jackson Lahmeyer, who has Rudy Giuliani's endorsement. Colorado Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet is unopposed in the primary but two GOP candidates are running to challenge him in November. Progressive groups are trying to influence the Republican primary, with ProgressNow Colorado launching a campaign to boost the more conservative of the two candidates. The group argues that businessman Joe O'Dea, the more moderate GOP candidate, has not been clear enough in his standing on abortion and Trump's voter fraud conspiracies. Redistricting created Colorado's biggest Latino-dominated district and now Democrats and Republicans are vying for their vote. And Lauren Boebert, one of the House's most far-right members, is facing GOP challengers and Democratic hopefuls as well. Thousands of Democrats have voted for GOP challenger Don Coram, a state senator, in hopes of knocking Boebert out of a chance for the November election. Republican voters will also have the chance to pick their nominee for secretary of state, the key state official role that oversees elections in the state. Among those running to challenge Democratic incumbent Jena Griswold is Mesa County Clerk Tina Peters, who was indicted by a grand jury in March on charges regarding an election security breach last summer related to Trump's voter fraud conspiracy theories. In a statement to the New York Times, Peters said Boebert \"encouraged\" her efforts. A press officer for the congresswoman said the allegations are false. Read more on the candidates from Colorado Public Radio. The Prairie State will have two incumbent vs. incumbent primaries for House seats. Redistricting forced Republicans Rodney Davis and Mary Miller into the same congressional district, as well as Democrats Sean Casten and Marie Newman. Davis voted in favor of both certifying the 2020 election results and of the investigation into the Jan. 6 insurrection and Trump has endorsed Miller \u2014 even attending a rally for her over the weekend. Despite not receiving the Trump endorsement, Davis by far leads Miller in fundraising and spending. In the Democratic incumbent faceoff, Casten leads over Newman in fundraising and advertisement spending. The winner will face one of six GOP candidates hoping to flip the seat. Also, the open seats of Democrat Cheri Bustos and Republican Adam Kinzinger are up for grabs. Bustos announced this spring that she would not seek reelection, leaving Sen. Dick Durbin as the remaining Democrat from the state outside of Chicago. Kinzinger, meanwhile, is one of two Republicans on the Democrat-led Jan. 6 committee investigating the insurrection and Trump's attempt to overturn the 2020 election. On Monday, Trump endorsed in two Republican U.S. House races, throwing his support behind incumbents Burgess Owens and Chris Stewart. Both were predicted to win before the endorsement. Also on the ballot is Sen. Mike Lee, who is expected to beat back challenges from two other Republicans. Lee could face a competitive race in November from independent Evan McMullin, who is being backed by Democrats and got about 20% of the state's vote running as an independent against Trump in 2016. Two incumbents were forced into runoffs in Mississippi since neither reached the 50% threshold needed to win the nomination on June 7. Republican Reps. Michael Guest, who voted in favor of the creation of the Jan. 6 committee to investigate the insurrection, and Steven Palazzo, who in 2021 faced an ethics investigation over misused campaign funds, will have one more shot at reelection in their respective districts. In South Carolina, Catherine Bruce and Krystle Matthews advance to a runoff  for the Democratic nomination to face incumbent Rep. Tim Scott in November. Jon Campbell contributed to this report.",

A poll taken after the decision showed 56% disapprove of it.\n                \n                    \n                    Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Abortion rights activists rally outside of the U.S. Supreme Court after the overturning of Roe v. Wade on Friday. A poll taken after the decision showed 56% disapprove of it. Majorities of Americans say they disagree with the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, think it was politically motivated, are concerned the court will now reconsider rulings that protect other rights, and are more likely to vote for a candidate this fall who would restore the right to an abortion, according to the latest NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll. Still, a majority opposes expanding the number of justices who could sit on the Supreme Court. In overturning Roe on Friday, the Supreme Court reversed 50 years of precedent that had made abortion a right in this country. The right to regulate abortion now is in states' hands, and about half the states have already moved to severely curtail access to an abortion or ban the procedure outright. Loading... The issue is personal to most Americans. Two-thirds of people responding to the poll say they or someone they know has had an abortion. That was true of three-quarters of independents, 7-in-10 Democrats and 55% of Republicans. Surveys have for years shown consistently that most Americans wanted to keep Roe in place and to see restrictions on when abortions could take place. What the court did is clearly outside the mainstream of public opinion, and that is reflected again in the NPR poll. The survey of 941 respondents, conducted Friday after the decision through Saturday, has a margin of error of +/-4.9 percentage points. By a 56%-to-40% margin, respondents oppose the court's decision, including 45% who strongly oppose it. Almost 9-in-10 Democrats and a slim majority of independents (53%) are against the decision. Three-quarters of Republicans, on the other hand, support it. There is a massive split by education \u2013 69% of college graduates oppose the decision while those without degrees are split. Half of whites without degrees support the decision, while two-thirds of whites with college degrees oppose it. A majority of men and women are against the decision, though a slightly higher percentage of women oppose it (59% vs. 54%). Along racial lines, 60% of non-whites and 54% of whites oppose the decision. (There were too few people surveyed to break out individual racial groups any further without margins of error getting too high.) By a 57%-to-36% margin, respondents said the decision was mostly based on politics as opposed to the law. And by a 56%-to-41% margin are concerned that the overturning of Roe will be used by the Supreme Court to reconsider past rulings that protect contraception, same-sex relationships, and same-sex marriage. Just 39% said they have a great deal or quite a lot of confidence in the Supreme Court; 58% said they have not very much or no confidence at all in the institution. That's a low in the poll. But few want to change the size of the court in the wake of the decision. Only a third of respondents said they were in favor of expanding the Supreme Court; 54% percent said they oppose that move. Sixty-two percent of Democrats said they are in favor of doing so, but 57% of independents and nearly 9-in-10 Republicans were opposed. This issue presents volatility into the 2022 midterms, because 78% of Democrats say the court's decision makes them more likely to vote this fall, 24 points higher than Republicans. A bare majority of 51% say they would definitely vote for a candidate who would support a federal law to restore the right to an abortion, while 36% would definitely vote against such a candidate. That could be a shot in the arm for Democrats if they mobilize around this issue, though Republicans are still favored at this point to take back the House this fall because of high inflation and gas prices. Democrats have regained the favor of voters to control Congress, with 48% saying they are more likely to vote for a Democratic candidate in the fall and 41% more likely to vote for a Republican. In April, Republicans led on that question in the poll 47% to 44%, which was within the margin of error. However, the lead for Democrats may not translate into maintaining control due to the way voters are geographically distributed and how boundaries of congressional districts are drawn. President Biden gets a 40% approval rating, while 53% disapprove of the job he is doing.",

Republicans who control the state legislature want to enforce a 1931 abortion ban that's still on the books. Democrats, including Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, have vowed not to let that happen. Whether or not abortion will remain legal in the state could come down to another high court, the Michigan Supreme Court. That's because earlier this year, Gov. Whitmer used a special Michigan executive power to ask the court to rule without an actual case before them on the constitutionality of that 1931 law. That law had been dormant since 1973 because of Roe v. Wade. Another case brought by Planned Parenthood of Michigan is also looking for a ruling on the constitutionality of the law. Just last month, a Michigan Court of Claims judge issued a preliminary injunction, which means right now, until the Michigan Supreme Court rules, abortion is still legal in Michigan. Michigan is a purple state. Whitmer and the attorney general are both Democrats, but the state House and state Senate are both controlled by Republicans and many Republican lawmakers are really happy with the decision from the U.S. Supreme Court on Friday. Last week, a group of conservative members of the legislature introduced bills that would even further punish abortion providers in Michigan. Whitmer says she would veto any legislation like that. \"Dangerous abortion bans take away our rights and put women's health and lives at risk,\" she said in response to the bills at a rally Friday night outside the state Capitol. \"If you know a Republican or independent who values women's rights, we've got to invite them to join us.\" Tudor Dixon is one of five Republicans running to be the GOP nominee to run against Whitmer in November. And just like the other four candidates, she is fervently anti-abortion. In fact, earlier this month, Dixon received the endorsement from Right to Life of Michigan, which is a big get in Michigan Republican politics. There's also Ryan Kelley. He gained a lot of attention recently when he was arrested at his home by the FBI for his involvement in the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol. He released a provocative statement after the Supreme Court decision saying that he would fight until \"we remove this scourge of abortion from the state of Michigan.\" There is currently a petition drive trying to amend the state constitution that would enshrine reproductive rights regardless of the 1931 statute. The deadline to submit enough signatures to get on the November ballot is just a couple of weeks away. If there are enough valid signatures, the question would go to voters in Michigan who would then get to vote on the issue. And, of course, that could make a difference in turnout for the November election when Whitmer is up for reelection.",

ALBANY - Congressman Lee Zeldin has emerged from the four-way Republican primary for governor as the winner, beating out Andrew Giuliani, the son of Rudy Giuliani, according to a race call from The Associated Press. Zeldin, of Long Island, had the backing of Republican Party leaders across the state who voted earlier this year to make him their designated candidate \u2014 a distinction that gave him an automatic spot on the primary ballot without petitioning. But incumbent Gov. Kathy Hochul is the candidate to beat in this race. New York has more than twice as many registered Democrats than registered Republicans, with independent voters also outpacing the GOP. Hochul, a Democrat from Buffalo, who had been New York's No. 2 official, rose to power in August after former Gov. Andrew Cuomo resigned under the weight of multiple sexual harassment allegations and scandals surrounding his once-lauded response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Her elevation to the state's top office made her the first woman to serve in the role, but still, no woman has ever been elected to the position. Now, Hochul is running for a full, four-year term as an incumbent with just 10 months in office under her belt. New York Gov.

Kathy Hochul, who won the primary, speaks during the Election Night party for governor in New York City on Tuesday. Hochul has a relentless campaign fundraising strategy that saw her amass more than $30 million. The governor's campaign has blanketed the state's airwaves touting her record during her short time in office, which includes a gas-tax reduction through the end of the year and a series of gun-control and abortion-access measures she signed into law just this month. On Saturday, the day after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the right to an abortion, Hochul tweeted from her official account, \"My message to anyone who needs abortion care: New York will be your safe harbor.\" My message to anyone who needs abortion care: New York will be your safe harbor. pic.twitter.com/CfbvrsFJAy But Hochul's tenure has not been without controversy. She selected then-state Sen. Brian Benjamin, a Manhattan Democrat, to replace her as lieutenant governor despite questions over his past campaign-fundraising tactics. Within six months, Benjamin was arrested on federal bribery charges and resigned. Hochul's opponents faulted her for spearheading a deal to build a new $1.4 billion football stadium for the Buffalo Bills, which came with $850 million in direct public subsidies. And they've latched on to her past positions on gun issues, which earned her an \"A\" rating from the National Rifle Association when she represented a conservative-leaning district in Congress a decade ago. Hochul has said her views have changed on the issue of gun control, and she successfully led the effort to boost the minimum age for purchasing a semi-automatic rifle from 18 to 21 in New York after an 18-year-old killed 10 people in a Buffalo supermarket last month. \"Judge me by what I've done,\" she said. \"Because a lot of people have evolved since I took that position. You know what we need? More people to evolve.\"",

Darren Bailey has won the primary, according to a race call from The Associated Press. He and incumbent Gov. JB Pritzker, a Democrat, will go head-to-head in November. Pritzker predictably won his two-way race Tuesday evening. Former President Donald Trump endorsed Darren Bailey Saturday after his popularity had been growing in the polls for months. The 2022 race for governor in Illinois is shaping up to be one of the most expensive gubernatorial elections in history. Pritzker, a billionaire, and two other mega-donors spent tens of millions of dollars trying to influence the outcome of the Republican primary. In fact, the governor \u2013 and the Democratic Governors Association \u2013 ran ads attempting to help Bailey win. Pritzker's and the DGA's strategy appears to be that Bailey would be one of the easier Republican candidates to beat in November's election, with their ads echoing that Bailey's policies \"are just too conservative for Illinois.\" It's not uncommon for one party to get involved in the other's primary, but it doesn't always work.

They're ready for something different.\" Bailey is a grain farmer from southern Illinois who has a distinct twang in his voice. He's pro-gun rights and opposes abortion rights. And, as seen by his endorsement, he is a fervent supporter of Trump. He also constantly criticizes the city of Chicago despite the fact that, as governor, he would oversee that economic engine of the state. \"Let's just call it like it is. Let's think about Chicago: A crime-ridden, corrupt, dysfunctional hellhole,\" Bailey said at a debate hosted by Chicago TV station WGN. Bailey also went so far as to sponsor a resolution that would separate Chicago from the rest of Illinois. It went nowhere in the state's Democratic-led legislature. That kind of rhetoric, though, has endeared him to wealthy businessman Dick Uihlein, who runs a shipping supply company bearing his last name. He has given Bailey's campaign more than $9 million. Uihlein is a major Republican donor who funded a group involved in the rally before the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol. Traditionally, Illinois GOP voters support more moderate Republicans who fit the mold of someone more like Richard Irvin. Irvin is the mayor of the Chicago suburb of Aurora \u2014 once made famous as the home of Wayne Campbell in Saturday Night Live's sketch \"Wayne's World\". Irvin had all the makings of running a highly competitive campaign in November thanks in large part to the $50 million dollars Chicago billionaire Ken Griffin contributed to him, but Irvin still couldn't pull out a win.

With a GOP majority in both chambers, the Keystone State could restrict abortion if a Republican wins the gubernatorial race. Shapiro told the crowd of more than a thousand, \"The reason why I'm hopeful today is because you're here,\" reported WHYY's Emily Rizzo.

After speaking to just a few people, there\u2019s lots of anger and concern that so much hinges on this race for governor. pic.twitter.com/gQ1iZbxX4O In a statement, state Sen. Doug Mastriano, the GOP candidate, said, \"Roe v. Wade is rightly relegated to the ash heap of history.\" He is the prime sponsor of a bill to restrict abortion in Pennsylvania. In Washington, D.C., protesters in favor of abortion rights continued gathering in front of the Supreme Court building, NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben reports. One man even slept on top of D.C.'s Frederick Douglass Memorial Bridge as a form of protest, Business Insider reports. Hundreds took to the streets in the sweltering heat of New Orleans, La., on Friday and called on city officials to make New Orleans a sanctuary city for abortions, according to WWNO's Carly Berlin.

            "article_content": "Abortion is still legal in Michigan but it's the subject of litigation. It will be a main campaign issue for Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and her most competitive Republican rival, Tudor Dixon.  ELISSA NADWORNY, HOST: In Michigan, the right to an abortion is teetering. Republicans who control the state legislature want to enforce a 1931 abortion ban that's still on the books. Democrats, including Governor Gretchen Whitmer, have vowed not to let that happen. Zoe Clark of Michigan Radio joins us now. Good morning, Zoe. ZOE CLARK, BYLINE: Good morning. NADWORNY: So what will the decision come down to in Michigan? CLARK: Yeah, actually, it could come down to another high court, the Michigan Supreme Court. That's because earlier this year, Governor Whitmer used this special executive power that governors in Michigan have. She asked the Michigan Supreme Court to rule without an actual case before them on the constitutionality of that 1931 law that you mentioned. Now, that law had been dormant because of Roe v. Wade. That was until this Friday, of course, when the United States Supreme Court ruled. However, an additional case, one brought by Planned Parenthood of Michigan - it's also looking for a ruling on the constitutionality of the law. And just last month, a court of claims judge issued a preliminary injunction, which means right now, until the Michigan Supreme Court rules, abortion is still legal in Michigan. But that's temporary. NADWORNY: So speaking of the governor, Whitmer - she is up for reelection this year. And it's looking like it's going to be a really tight race, right? CLARK: Yeah. Yeah. I mean, Michigan is a purple state. Whitmer and the attorney general are both Democrats, but the state House and Senate are both controlled by Republicans. And both those chambers are up for election in November. Many Republican lawmakers in the state are really happy with the Supreme Court decision. And just late last week, a small group of really conservative members introduced bills that would even further punish abortion providers in the state. Governor Whitmer would veto any legislation like that. In fact, here she is at a rally Friday night outside the state Capitol, talking about those bills. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) GRETCHEN WHITMER: Dangerous abortion bans that take away our rights and put women's health and lives at risk. So if you know a Republican or independent who values women's rights, we've got to invite them to join us. NADWORNY: OK. So tell us about the Republican field vying to go up against Whitmer. I mean, that primary election is coming up in August, right? Who are the other players here? CLARK: Yeah. Yeah. So Tudor Dixon is 1 of 5 Republicans running to be the GOP nominee to run against Whitmer in November. And just like the other four candidates, she is fervently anti-abortion. In fact, earlier this month, Tudor Dixon - she received the really important endorsement from Right to Life of Michigan. That is a big get in Michigan Republican politics. But there's also Ryan Kelley, right? He gained a lot of attention just last week. That's when he was arrested at his home by the FBI for his involvement in the January 6 attack on the Capitol. He released this really provocative statement after the Supreme Court decision was released. And he said in part that he would fight until, quote, \"we remove this scourge of abortion from the state of Michigan.\" NADWORNY: Yeah, wow. I should note also that Whitmer doesn't have a primary. She's running unopposed on the Democratic side. CLARK: Exactly. NADWORNY: So a lot is riding on voters' choices of a new governor. Is that election the only path forward for voters? CLARK: Not necessarily. In fact, there is currently a petition drive trying to amend the state constitution. It would enshrine reproductive rights into the state constitution. That's regardless of the 1931 statute. The deadline to submit enough signatures to get on the November ballot - that is happening in a little over two weeks. If there are enough valid signatures, the question would go to the November ballot. And voters here in Michigan would then get to decide the issue. And, of course, that could make a difference in turnout for the November election when Gretchen Whitmer is up for reelection. NADWORNY: Yeah. Goes back to that governor's race. CLARK: Uh-huh. NADWORNY: That was Michigan Radio's Zoe Clark. Thank you so much for your reporting, Zoe. CLARK: Oh, thanks so much. Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.  All rights reserved.

When Texas' law restricting abortions took effect last year, the Trust Women clinic in Oklahoma City doubled the number of days a week it provided abortions, according to Dr. Maya Bass. Even so, many pregnant people had to wait, to save money for a longer trip or to get off the waitlist. \"So we're seeing people who are later in pregnancy. We're seeing people who are sicker,\" said Bass. This May, Oklahoma banned almost all abortions. The clinic shut down. Once again, providers shifted to expand appointments elsewhere \u2014 this time, in Kansas, where abortion remains legal. Abortion funds and clinics also started doing more outreach and education. In some states, pills that induce an abortion are available by mail. Providers expanded efforts to counsel patients over the phone about where to get them and how to use them. \"In a lot of ways, this is going to look different than before Roe. But if people don't know about [medication abortion], they might try other less safe options,\" said Bass.",

President Biden said there's little he can do on his own to change the situation.  MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: Hundreds have gathered outside of the Supreme Court. (SOUNDBITE OF PROTEST) UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTERS: This decision will not stand. KELLY: And we continue our coverage on this historic day, where the constitutional right to an abortion in the U.S. is no more. AILSA CHANG, HOST: The decision comes nearly 50 years after the landmark Roe v. Wade ruling... (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE) UNIDENTIFIED JOURNALIST #1: In a landmark ruling, the Supreme Court today legalized abortion... UNIDENTIFIED JOURNALIST #2: ...Overrides most state laws concerning abortion. The court... UNIDENTIFIED JOURNALIST #3: ...Said in a 7-2 decision that in the first three months of pregnancy... UNIDENTIFIED JOURNALIST #4: ...Abortion is completely a private matter to be decided by mother and doctor. CHANG: ...That established the right to an abortion in 1973. But now, whether or not abortions should be legal or illegal is up to each individual state. Scores of activists and politicians alike have pushed for this day, and many are celebrating. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE: (Singing) And tonight's going to be a good, good night. KELLY: House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy called the decision a historic victory. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KEVIN MCCARTHY: This great nation can now live up to its core principle that all are created equal, not born equal. KELLY: Twenty-two states have laws that will or already are restricting abortion, including Missouri, where State Attorney General Eric Schmidt said this. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ERIC SCHMIDT: We believe that without the explicit protections of the right to life, all liberties are under attack, which is why the importance of this day cannot be overstated. CHANG: Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton declared today a holiday for his staff in honor of, quote, \"unborn babies.\" Kelsey Smith from Clemson, S.C., a like-minded supporter who was at the Supreme Court today, said this. KELSEY SMITH: Very excited, very happy, very grateful. The pro-life movement wants to make abortion illegal, unthinkable and unnecessary. KELLY: But at the White House today, a somber reaction. (SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE) PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: It just stuns me. So I've seen that doctors will be criminalized for fulfilling their duty to care. Imagine having a young woman having to carry a child of incest, as a consequence of incest, no option. KELLY: President Biden acknowledged there is little he can do on his own to change the situation. He says now it's up to voters if they want to see abortion rights restored. NPR's Asma Khalid is at the White House. Hey, Asma. ASMA KHALID, BYLINE: Hi there. KELLY: So this is not the ruling the president was hoping for. He called today a sad day. What struck you from his comments? KHALID: You know, really, Mary Louise, there was a sense of pragmatism in what we heard from him today. He flatly said that the health of women in this nation are now more at risk. And he explicitly tied the decision to three justices who were appointed by former President Donald Trump. And he referred to the decision as the realization of a, quote, \"extreme ideology.\" I will say, you know, by the way, Mary Louise, the former president, former President Trump, did take credit for today's ruling. You know, when we heard from President Biden, he seemed to also emphasize that the court had never done what it did today, which in his view was to expressly take away a constitutional right that had already been recognized. You know, I got the sense from how he spoke today that he was trying to remain publicly optimistic and insist that this fight is not over, though ultimately, he also knows there's little he can do by himself. (SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE) BIDEN: Let me be very clear and unambiguous. The only way we can secure a woman's right to choose, the balance that existed, is for Congress to restore the protections of Roe v. Wade as federal law. No executive action from the president can do that. KELLY: I guess the challenge there, Asma, is that Congress doesn't have the votes to restore the protection of Roe v. Wade as federal law. KHALID: You are right. And the president himself acknowledged that. You know, essentially then, at this point then, this becomes a campaign issue for Democrats. And we did hear from President Biden today this sense of urging voters to elect people who will restore abortion rights. He explicitly said, Roe is on the ballot this fall. I think that, you know, one of the big unknowns is what this actually will mean for the November elections to date. In polling, we've seen that rising prices, inflation have been the top concern. We also see in polling that young voters have been really disenfranchised with Joe Biden's presidency to date. And I have a, you know, question of whether or not seeing this fear, you know, seeing this right eroded will suddenly motivate them to give Democrats another chance. But really, again, Mary Louise, nobody knows how much this issue will galvanize the left. KELLY: Well, one thing we did know was that this decision was almost certainly coming. We all saw the leaked draft decision. What had the White House done to prepare? KHALID: Well, for the past couple of months, they had been meeting with advocates, legal experts, faith leaders, doctors, nurses. In fact, just yesterday, the vice president brought seven Democratic attorneys general together to discuss the issue. I spoke with a couple of people who've been invited, these White House meetings. One was Reverend Najuma Smith-Pollard from California. She told me that part of the conversation that she had with the vice president was about what to do if Roe was overturned. NAJUMA SMITH-POLLARD: We know California would be a safe place for women to come. So creating that network, that's one of those next steps - creating a network for women where women can go for safe abortion, safe procedures, so they're not at greater harm and greater risk. KELLY: Do we know how that message was received? Is creating that kind of network something the White House wants to get involved with? KHALID: Well, I will say it is an indication of what we heard from the president of what he wants to maintain. You know, he explicitly said today that his administration will ensure women are free to travel across state lines for an abortion. He also said that his administration will work to protect women's access to medications, as some of which are delivered by mail. But really, Mary Louise, I mean, these are all steps that the president and his White House can take that are at the margin. The biggest change is that as of today, the fundamental right to an abortion is no longer the law of the land. And the president, as he himself acknowledged, has limited power to change that at the moment. KELLY: NPR's Asma Khalid at the White House for us today. Thanks, Asma. KHALID: Happy to do it.

            "article_content": "The Supreme Court's abortion decision raises big questions around whether Congress will respond and how it could affect the campaign for control this November.  MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: Today's Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade returns the question of whether abortion should be legal to the states. But President Joe Biden and many others on both sides of the issue are asking whether Congress will step in and enact any new abortion laws and whether the issue will weigh on voters as they decide which party should have control in elections this fall. NPR political correspondent Danielle Kurtzleben is following this and joins us now. Hey. DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN, BYLINE: Hey there. KELLY: Give us the overview of just what the reaction on Capitol Hill has been like today. KURTZLEBEN: Well, it's - it is in many ways what you would expect. Abortion rights proponents, which is to say pretty much Democrats, are very upset. At a press conference today, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was visibly and audibly very angry. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) NANCY PELOSI: This is deadly serious, but we are not going to let this pass. A woman's right to choose - reproductive freedom - is on the ballot in November. KURTZLEBEN: Now of course, on the other side of the aisle, it's pretty celebratory. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who has been chiefly responsible for delivering this conservative Supreme Court majority, he said in a statement that the ruling, quote, \"has corrected a terrible legal and moral error.\" Now, interestingly, some of the statements from some Republicans have been celebratory but with a certain caveat. For example, Tennessee Senator Marsha Blackburn, Texas Senator Ted Cruz, they made statements that celebrated this but also stressed that this is not a ban, it just sends abortion back to the states. Now, you can read that a couple of ways. One is to make - that they're making the political point that this is simply the right decision, that this is how it always should have been, that Roe was wrong. And that's how one abortion rights opponent explained it to me today. But you can also simply read this as them trying to avoid making this ruling sound extreme because many, many Americans are not extreme on abortion. They are in the middle on abortion rights. KELLY: All right. So that's what they are saying. What about what they are doing? Is Congress going to do anything, either under Democrats, who would like to protect abortion rights, or any other directions if Republicans take over? KURTZLEBEN: Well, they'd like to, but of course, there's the filibuster. I mean, the House has passed a bill to codify abortion rights. And when Republicans controlled the House, they passed nationwide abortion restrictions. But of course, neither party has had a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate for a while. Now, Democrats from Pelosi right on down have been calling on the filibuster to be overturned today, but of course, it's another issue whether centrists in the Senate like Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, both of them Democrats, whether they say - they say that they would want to codify Roe, but they don't support doing away with the filibuster. One other thing to keep our eye on, though, on the Republican side is that Republican Congressman Chris Smith of New Jersey, he has authored anti-abortion rights legislation. And he told CNN today he'd have a bill to ban abortion after 15 weeks, but he acknowledged that it might not - that it couldn't pass the Senate even if Republicans win back control because as long as a Democrat is president, it's going to face a veto. KELLY: To this point that we're hearing politicians making about, this should be on the ballot; this is what should be driving you to come vote in November; make your voice heard that way - what does that actually look like? KURTZLEBEN: Well, it looks like a lot of fundraising, like a lot of organizing. The Susan B. Anthony List, which is one of the big anti-abortion rights organizations, has already, ahead of this ruling, bought $2 million in ads in battleground states with the message of voters should make this decision, not courts - not federal courts... KELLY: Right. KURTZLEBEN: ...That it should be a state thing. Meanwhile, on the abortion rights side, it's just, hey; we need to fight harder; we need to fight bigger. But there's also a lot of fatigue on that side. KELLY: Right. KURTZLEBEN: So it's a really big question about motivation. KELLY: NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben, thanks. KURTZLEBEN: Yes, thank you.

In a historic and far-reaching decision, the U.S. Supreme Court officially reversed Roe v. Wade on Friday, declaring that the constitutional right to abortion, upheld for nearly a half century, no longer exists. Writing for the court majority, Justice Samuel Alito said that the 1973 Roe ruling and repeated subsequent high court decisions reaffirming Roe \"must be overruled\" because they were \"egregiously wrong,\" the arguments \"exceptionally weak\" and so \"damaging\" that they amounted to \"an abuse of judicial authority.\" The decision, most of which was leaked in early May, means that abortion rights will be rolled back in nearly half of the states immediately, with more restrictions likely to follow. For all practical purposes, abortion will not be available in large swaths of the country. The decision may well mean too that the court itself, as well as the abortion question, will become a focal point in the upcoming fall elections and in the fall and thereafter. Joining the Alito opinion were Justice Clarence Thomas, appointed by the first President Bush, and the three Trump appointees \u2014 Justices Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett. Chief Justice John Roberts, appointed by President George W. Bush, concurred in the judgment only, and would have limited the decision to upholding the Mississippi law at issue in the case, which banned abortions after 15 weeks. Calling the decision \"a serious jolt to the legal system,\" he said that both the majority and dissent displayed \"a relentless freedom from doubt  on the legal issue that I cannot share.\" Dissenting were Justices Stephen Breyer, appointed by President Clinton, and Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, appointed by President Obama. The said that the court decision means that \"young women today will come of age with fewer rights than their mothers and grandmothers.\" Indeed, they said the court's opinion means that   \"from the very moment of fertilization, a woman has no rights to speak of. A state can force her to bring a pregnancy to term even at the steepest personal and familial costs.\" \"With sorrow \u2014 for this Court, but more, for the many millions of American women who have today lost a fundamental constitutional protection \u2014 we dissent,\" they wrote. Alito's  78-page opinion, which has a 30-page appendix, seemingly leaves no authority uncited as support for the proposition that there is no inherent right to privacy or personal autonomy in various provisions of the Constitution \u2014 and similarly, no evidence that peoples' reliance on the court's abortion precedents over the past half century should matter. Alito pointed for instance, to Planned Parenthood v. Casey, the 1992 decision that upheld the central holding of Roe and was written by Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Anthony Kennedy and David Souter, all Republican appointees to the court. Alito pointed to language in the Casey opinion that he said \"conceded\" reliance interests were not really implicated because contraception could prevent almost all unplanned pregnancies. In fact, though, that 1992 opinion went on to dismiss that very argument as \"unrealistic,\" because it \"refuse[s] to face the fact\" that for decades \"people have organized intimate relationships and made choices ... in reliance on the availability of abortion in the event that contraception should fail.\" Not exactly the concession that Alito described. It is not unusual for justices to cherry pick quotes but not so out of context and not from former colleagues who are still alive and privately, not amused at all. In the end, though, Alito's opinion has a larger objective, perhaps multiple objectives. Writing for the majority, he said forthrightly that abortion is a matter to be decided by states and the voters in the states. \"We hold,\" he wrote, that \"the Constitution does not confer a right to abortion.\" As to what standard the courts should apply in the event that a state regulation is challenged, Alito said any state regulation of abortion is presumptively valid and \"must be sustained if there is a rational basis on which the legislature could have thought\" it was serving \"legitimate state interests,\" including \"respect for and preservation of prenatal life at all stages of development.\" In addition, he noted, states are entitled to regulate abortion to eliminate \"gruesome and barbaric\" medical procedures; to \"preserve the integrity of the medical profession\"; and to prevent discrimination on the basis of race, sex, or disability, including barring abortion in cases of fetal abnormality. Ultimately, the translation of all that is that states appear to be completely free to ban abortions for any reason. Near the end of Friday's  decision, Alito sought to allay fears about the wide-ranging nature of his opinion. \"To ensure that our decision is not misunderstood or mischaracterized, we emphasize that our decision concerns the constitutional right to abortion and no other right. Nothing in this opinion should be understood to cast doubt on precedents that do not concern abortion. \" But in his concurring opinion, Justice Thomas said the legal rationale for Friday's decision could be applied to overturn other major cases, including those that legalized gay marriage, barred the criminalization of consensual homosexual conduct, and protected the rights of married people to have access to contraception. \"For that reason, in future cases, we should reconsider all\" of those precedents.  because they are \"demonstrably erroneous.'\" The court's liberals noted that Thomas's language cast doubt on Alito's assurances at the end of his opinion, that this opinion was really only about abortion. \"The first problem with the majority's account comes from Justice Thomas's concurrence\u2014which makes clear he is not with the program,\" they wrote. \"In saying that nothing in today's opinion casts doubt on non-abortion precedents, Justice Thomas explains, he means only that they are not at issue in this very case.\" The next steps on abortion across the country will play out in a variety of ways, almost all of them resulting in abortion bans. Several states \u2014 among them Mississippi, North Carolina, and Wisconsin \u2014 still have decades-old abortion bans on their books; with Roe overturned, those states could revert to a pre-Roe environment. Officials in such states could seek to enforce old laws, or ask the courts to reinstate them. For example, a Michigan law dating back to 1931 would make abortion a felony. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, has been working to try to block that law. Another path to banning abortion involves \"trigger bans,\" newer laws pushed through by anti-abortion rights legislators in many states in anticipation of the Supreme Court's action. Some 15 states \u2013 in the South, West and Midwest \u2013 have such laws in place, according to CRR and Guttmacher, but they fall into different categories. Some states will act quickly to ban abortion. According to a new analysis by the Guttmacher Institute, South Dakota, Kentucky and Louisiana have laws in place that lawmakers designed explicitly to take effect immediately upon the fall of the Roe precedent. Idaho, Tennessee, and Texas \u2013 where most abortions are already illegal after about six weeks of pregnancy \u2013 have similar laws, which would take effect after 30 days. Guttmacher says seven other \"trigger ban\" states have laws that would require state officials such as governors or attorneys general to take action to implement them. Sue Liebel, state policy director with the anti-abortion rights group Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, said she expects officials in many of those Republican-controlled states to take swift action to do so. \"We have been talking to all of those about acting immediately,\" Liebel told NPR. \"So when that happens, let's be ready. How do you get that back into play?\" In recent years, many states also have passed gestational bans prohibiting abortion at various stages of pregnancy. Courts have blocked many of those laws in response to legal challenges, including laws in Georgia, Ohio, and Idaho that ban abortions after six weeks of pregnancy. Now those laws may take effect immediately. So too, could a law recently enacted in Oklahoma, that makes performing abortion a felony punishable by time in prison. \"It will be a tremendous change in an incredibly short period of time,\" said Julie Rikelman, senior director of litigation at the Center for Reproductive Rights. Rikelman argued the Center's challenge to Mississippi's abortion ban at Supreme Court this term. A host of other restrictions could limit where, by whom, and under what conditions abortion can be provided. Some examples include laws requiring parental notification or consent for abortions involving patients who are minors; and other health regulations for doctors and clinics that many medical groups say are unnecessary, expensive, and difficult to comply with. Finally, Liebel said some governors may consider calling special sessions to pass new legislation in response to Friday's ruling. Legal experts say the court's decision will pose new questions for other courts to deal with \u2013 questions about how to apply the specific language of the final ruling to individual state laws. Rikelman, the Center for Reproductive rights attorney, predicts \"legal chaos\" in states across the country in the immediate aftermath of the decision. \"I think what we will see is far more litigation in the federal courts \u2013 not less litigation,\" Rikelman said. Some states such as Texas and Oklahoma have multiple abortion restrictions on the books, raising potential questions about which ones would be valid. Those laws each include different provisions and carry different penalties, adding to the potential confusion and prompting additional litigation in state and federal courts. Liebel, with SBA Pro-Life America, acknowledged that more legal battles are likely. \"That's gonna take us back, frankly, to where we always have been. Each side tries to put their big toe right on that line and push the envelope,\" Liebel said. Battles in state courts are also likely. Some state constitutions may offer protections for abortion rights notwithstanding the U.S. Supreme Court's interpretation of the U.S. Constitution. In Florida, for example, the American Civil Liberties Union and other reproductive rights groups are challenging a 15-week abortion ban modeled on Mississippi's law, on the grounds that it violates privacy rights protections guaranteed in Florida's state constitution. Even without overturning Roe, Rikelman points to the Texas law known as S.B. 8, which took effect in September. The law, which has spawned several copycat proposals in other states, including Oklahoma, relies on individuals filing civil lawsuits to enforce an abortion ban. Abortion bans in restrictive states will likely bleed over to states that protect abortion rights as well, Rikelman said. She notes that some state lawmakers are trying to prohibit people in other states from providing abortions to their residents. \"What we are seeing already are states and state legislators impacting even people's ability to access abortion in places where it would remain legal,\" she said. For example, an omnibus abortion law passed by a Republican supermajority in Kentucky earlier this year includes a host of new requirements for dispensing medication abortion pills, and a provision for extraditing people from other states who illegally provide abortion pills to Kentuckians. It's unclear how enforceable those types of laws would be. Meanwhile, some states are trying to expand access to abortion in preparation for more patients traveling from restrictive states for procedures. Connecticut lawmakers passed legislation this year designed to protect abortion providers from out-of-state lawsuits. \"This just raises a whole host of issues,\" Rikelman said. \"All of those different disputes will have to be worked out in the courts\" including, potentially, in the U.S. Supreme Court. What's more, the anti-abortion movement will not be satisfied with this win, observes University of Michigan law professor Leah Litman.  \"The next time the Republicans win control of the Senate and White House and the House of Representatives a national abortion ban is going to be on the table,\" she said in an interview. Even as abortions have now become far more restricted overall, the Guttmacher Institute reports that the long-term decline in abortions has reversed. In 2020, there were 930,160 abortions in the U.S., an increase of 8 percent more abortions than in 2017. The Institute also said that at the same time, fewer people were getting pregnant and among those who did, a larger proportion chose to have an abortion.",

            "article_content": "As Americans wait for a Supreme Court decision on a case that could overturn the 1973 decision that legalized abortion in the U.S., other countries already provide a snapshot of what that's like.  LEILA FADEL, HOST: In 1973, the Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade decision legalized abortion across the United States. Now, nearly 50 years later, it could overturn that decision this month. Abortion activists are concerned about what that means going forward. But could other countries already be providing a snapshot? NPR's Deb Amos reports from Warsaw, Poland, which has the toughest restrictions on abortion in Europe. And a quick warning, there is a brief discussion of rape in this story. (SOUNDBITE OF PHONE RINGING) ANTONINA LEWANDOWSKA: Oh, sorry. That's probably an abortion intervention. (SOUNDBITE OF PHONE RINGING) LEWANDOWSKA: (Non-English language spoken). DEBORAH AMOS, BYLINE: In Poland, abortions are almost entirely illegal. But there are still legal ways to help women who call this hotline, says Antonina Lewandowska. She's with FEDERA, Poland's oldest family planning and pro-choice organization. She sympathizes with Americans who fear the worst when the U.S. Supreme Court rules on abortion. Poland had the toughest restrictions in Europe. And last year, Poland's constitutional court tightened the ban even more. LEWANDOWSKA: You can look at us as a warning. Or you can look at us as... AMOS: She eventually settles on Poland is a guide because activists here have already found loopholes in the government ban. LEWANDOWSKA: There is a saying in Polish - if I cannot get through the door, I will get in through the window. And that's what we are doing. AMOS: Lewandowska can legally direct women to websites listing clinics in countries where abortion is legal. She can point out websites that offer abortion pills from the Netherlands, delivery within 24 hours. Then she knows the links to private groups who can pay when a woman cannot. All this is backed by a coalition of activists across Europe. (SOUNDBITE OF PHONE RINGING) LEWANDOWSKA: That's a day at work here. AMOS: There was a day when Poland was the destination for abortions, legal through the 1980s under a communist government. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) UNIDENTIFIED CHOIR: (Singing in non-English language). AMOS: The change came in 1989 with the end of one-party rule and the first democratic elections. The Catholic Church, that had led the fight against communism, pushed for an abortion ban. The parliament obliged. In 1993, the law had broad support. There were three exceptions - when a woman's life is at risk, the pregnancy results from rape or incest or the fetus is damaged. And that by far was the majority of legal terminations. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) UNIDENTIFIED CHOIR: (Singing) Amen. AMOS: Over time, the Catholic Church has chipped away at the exceptions and successfully lobbied the Polish government to create other laws protecting, as church officials say, the sanctity of life. RAFAL DOROSINSKI: We are glad that so far we are winning and that most of the society is on our side. AMOS: That's Rafal Dorosinski, a lawyer and an advocate for Ordo Iuris. In addition to the abortion ban, this conservative catholic group pushed to end government support for in vitro fertilization, which the church considers a sin. And last year, Ordo Iuris applauded when the government decreed that a woman could no longer have a legal abortion when her fetus is damaged, even if there are life-threatening abnormalities. (SOUNDBITE OF PROTEST) AMOS: Last year, as protests erupted across the country - the largest in 30 years - the latest constraint changed the abortion debate. Surveys showed a majority of Poles wanted more reproductive rights. And the culture war heated up again this year when Poland became a destination for Ukrainian war refugees, including rape survivors, says Dorosinski. DOROSINSKI: We should do everything we can to help those who suffered during the war. But let's not confuse the terms. We shouldn't consider killing unborn children as a kind of help. Killing a baby is killing a baby. It's not giving help to anybody. AMOS: Hello. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Hello. RAFAL KUZLIK: Nice to meet you. AMOS: You're the doctor? KUZLIK: Yes, I am. AMOS: That's Rafal Kuzlik, a gynecologist, an obstetrician who treats Ukrainian rape survivors. He dismisses the charge that Ukrainian women came to Poland for abortions. It's legal in Ukraine. KUZLIK: They're taking care of it in Ukraine. And there is no problem for them. We are not expecting pregnant women for helping them with abortion. AMOS: It's Polish patients who are desperate for help now that the last significant exception, fetal abnormalities, has been banned. Kuzlik says the ban created a climate of fear, doctors afraid to abort a fetus with a heartbeat who won't live after birth, risking the mother's life. There are two highly publicized deaths of pregnant women that underline the unintended consequences of what he says is a harsh new ban. KUZLIK: If you believe in God - I do. But if you believe in God, you will be judged after your death, not here. If you have a problem, if your baby is without head, if your baby is, you know, with any kind of diseases or doesn't let you live after birth, I will help you. AMOS: Kuzlik insists radicals connected to the church and the government are in power now and pushing this agenda. The latest radical move, he says, the government requires Poland's central health care system to check if a patient is pregnant no matter what she came in for. Critics call it the pregnancy registry. Is it also the government's aim to track if a pregnancy ends? Antonina Lewandowska with FEDERA says, it's not yet clear. LEWANDOWSKA: I think it's a big deal and not a big deal at the same time because that is true, not much is actually changing. The criminal law hasn't changed. People can still terminate their own pregnancies legally until the 22nd week of gestation. So nothing has changed. The only difference is the information about the pregnancy would be actually put on - in the online medical records of the patient. (SOUNDBITE OF PHONE RINGING) LEWANDOWSKA: Goodness gracious. Sorry for that. (SOUNDBITE OF PHONE RINGING) LEWANDOWSKA: (Non-English language spoken). AMOS: It is still legal, she insists, for a pregnant woman in Poland to terminate her pregnancy abroad. And it's still legal to order abortion pills. In fact, the data shows that Poland's abortion ban has not actually stopped abortions. The numbers remain consistent despite the ban, as Polish women find ways to make their own decisions about their bodies. Deborah Amos, NPR News, Warsaw.

            "article_content": "Law professor Mary Ziegler explains how the anti-abortion movement upended the GOP establishment and helped push the courts to the right. Her new book is Dollars for Life.  TERRY GROSS, HOST: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. The Supreme Court is wrapping up its term, and it's expected that the court will overturn Roe v. Wade. A draft of Justice Alito's majority opinion that was leaked early last month would end the federally guaranteed constitutional right to abortion and allow states to write their own abortion laws. This is happening as we approach the 50th anniversary of Roe. We're going to talk about how we got here and what might happen next. My guest, Mary Ziegler, has written several books and many articles and op-eds about the debates and battles over abortion. She says overturning Roe isn't the final goal of the anti-abortion movement. Her new book is called \"Dollars For Life: The Anti-Abortion Movement And The Fall Of The Republican Establishment.\" It's about how the anti-abortion movement became a major force within the Republican Party and, in the process, transformed the party, opening the door to insurgents and populists like Donald Trump. Ziegler is a professor of law at the University of California, Davis. We recorded our interview yesterday. Mary Ziegler, welcome to FRESH AIR. Justice Alito's draft said that Roe was egregiously wrong from the start. On what grounds? MARY ZIEGLER: It answers this question that there can be no right to abortion by looking at what Justice Alito describes as history and tradition, which he says are the exclusive source of our constitutional rights. And this version of history and tradition are fairly frozen, right? They don't evolve over time. So Justice Alito focuses on the 19th century and reasons that abortion had been a crime throughout much of the history of the common law and was certainly a crime in most states at the time the relevant constitutional provision, the 14th Amendment was written. So the thought, at least as Justice Alito frames it, is that there can be no abortion right if most states treated abortion as illicit or even criminal. GROSS: So what you're saying is when the 14th Amendment guaranteeing equal protection was passed, abortion was illegal in many states. But that doesn't have to do with privacy, and Roe v. Wade was based on privacy. So what's the connection between the 14th Amendment and privacy? ZIEGLER: So the 14th Amendment and privacy, the court had described that connection or illuminated that connection in a series of decisions, really, dating back to the 1920s but particularly to the 1960s. And the idea central to those decisions was that there are constitutional rights beyond those spelled out in the text of the Constitution. And I think even Justice Alito would agree with that. The court in the '60s and '70s and beyond suggested that rights to make certain key decisions in one's own life - so privacy in the sense more of self-determination or autonomy than in the sense of just secrecy - those rights were integral enough to be covered by the 14th Amendment and that those key decisions often involve matters involving family, so the right to dictate the upbringing of one's children, the right to procreate, the right to marry. Ultimately, that would come to include same-sex marriage, the right to use contraception. So what you see Justice Alito saying here is something that kind of runs up against this idea of privacy - right? - that our basic rights have to be defined, Justice Alito suggests, in a far narrower way that looks almost exclusively to what the people who wrote the 14th Amendment in the 19th century would have thought. GROSS: If Roe was built on the 14th Amendment and the right to privacy, what are some of the other cases that were built on the precedent of Roe that could be challenged now? ZIEGLER: Well, I think it's better to think of this as a sort of interconnected web of decisions about privacy in the sense of self-determination and autonomy, and often it's an idea of autonomy that's closely connected to norms of equality. So after Roe, for example, we see decisions about same-sex intimacy, so laws that had once criminalized sodomy being struck down, certainly marriage between people of the same sex. There are older decisions that Roe draws on that are closely tied to it, like decisions involving birth control, interracial marriage, with whom you can live, so your right to live with blood family, even in scenarios where zoning ordinances may make that difficult. All of those decisions touch on these ideas about the most personal, intimate and consequential life decisions and insulating people from state interference with those decisions. So if the Supreme Court is essentially saying the abortion right doesn't make sense because of how people would have thought at the time the 14th Amendment was written, we can reasonably ask whether the same logic could apply to the other rights in this interconnected web. GROSS: How do you think overturning Roe affects the future of birth control? ZIEGLER: Many may remember during fights about the Affordable Care Act's contraceptive mandate that religious employers objected to subsidizing what they described as abortion-inducing drugs, and they applied that term to IUDs, to emergency contraceptives. And so there may be some states that simply define as abortion common forms of contraception and ban them that way. So I think that's the most likely thing we're going to see in the short term, that abortion bans themselves will affect access to contraception. It's possible - I think less likely - that states would try to prohibit contraception directly. But at the moment, I haven't seen evidence that conservative states are looking to regulate contraception directly. Of course, that could change. You know, if you would've asked me five or 10 years ago if we would be having this conversation about Roe, I probably wouldn't have said yes. GROSS: Is overturning Roe like the final destination for the anti-abortion movement? Or are there plans to go beyond that? ZIEGLER: Oh, there are definitely plans to go beyond it. So I think in the book and in all of my research, it's quite clear that the anti-abortion movement is a personhood movement. From its inception, the anti-abortion movement was about the idea that there are fundamental rights for unborn children, that unborn children or fetuses have rights to equality under the law, have rights to due process of the law. And that's the end goal, right? It's not overturning Roe and allowing states to do whatever they want; it's instead to require that all states, so progressive as well as conservative states, cannot permit abortion. And it's also, of course, to prevent as many abortions as possible from happening until that personhood goal is reached. So overturning Roe, of course, is a major step, but it will neither mean the declaration of personhood nor necessarily a huge decline in the number of abortions if people are allowed to travel out of state. And if states are not punishing women and pregnant people and they can get abortion medications on the internet and if progressive states step up their support for people seeking abortion, financially and otherwise, we may not see that much of a decline in the abortion rate. So I think this battle will continue. And for abortion opponents, this is more the beginning of the story than the end. GROSS: To bestow on the fetus the right of personhood - what would that require? Is that something states can do, or does that require a constitutional amendment? Because there had been a movement for a constitutional amendment, but as you write in your books, the anti-abortion movement kind of realized that was out of reach, at least then in the past. ZIEGLER: Right. I mean, so there are state efforts to declare personhood within states. So that's quite common in red states. But again, from the standpoint of the anti-abortion movement, that doesn't really matter a lot. So what the anti-abortion movement is looking for is nationwide personhood protection. That in theory would be possible, as you mentioned, through a constitutional amendment, which still seems politically impossible, or potentially through a Supreme Court decision. I think this is what some people in the anti-abortion movement want now, a Supreme Court decision saying abortion is unconstitutional. Now, of course, that kind of Supreme Court decision, just like any other, could be overturned. But that would be more realistic, I think, from the standpoint of the anti-abortion movement than a constitutional amendment. They might also ask for federal legislation banning abortion, but that, too, of course, could be repealed by a subsequent Congress or vetoed depending on who's in the White House. GROSS: Let's take a short break here, and then, we'll talk some more. If you're just joining us, my guest is Mary Ziegler, who's written several books about the abortion wars. Her new one is called \"Dollars For Life: The Anti-Abortion Movement And The Fall Of The Republican Establishment.\" We'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF SOLANGE SONG, \"WEARY\") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to my interview with Mary Ziegler. She's written extensively about the abortion wars. Her new book is called \"Dollars For Life: The Anti-Abortion Movement And The Fall Of The Republican Establishment.\" It's about how the anti-abortion movement became so powerful in the Republican Party and, in the process, weakened the Republican establishment and opened the doors to insurgents and populists like Donald Trump. Our interview was recorded yesterday. If we look at the present and project into the future - in the present, we already have laws in some red states that are very strict about abortion. Projecting into the future, what kind of conflicts do you foresee between red states and blue states about how abortion should be regulated? For example, if a red state passes a law that women aren't allowed to travel to another state for abortions, but blue states welcome women who want to go there for an abortion, like, who wins? How is that decided? ZIEGLER: Well, the problem is that there's not a very clear answer to that question because there are just really no good parallels legally to that setup, right? If you try to rack your brain for what are scenarios where one state says if you go do something that's legal in another state, we're going to punish you or punish the person helping you do that thing in the other state, you can't really come up with great examples. So there are different areas of ambiguity that make this complicated. The first is what lawyers would call choice of law. So when states say - one state says something is illegal, another state says something is legal, who gets to decide? There's a whole body of law and scholarship on this question, and the answer is pretty ambiguous. And then there are constitutional questions as well. There is a constitutional right to travel. There's questions about whether that's violated if a red state says you cannot go to a blue state to do this or the blue state doctor cannot help you if you go. And there are questions involving what's called the Dormant Commerce Clause, which deals with states' interference with commerce in other states. The problem is that these areas of law are pretty underdeveloped, so we don't have a lot of guidance from precedent or from the Supreme Court about what either of them really will look like in this context. So what you're really going to be seeing is conservative and progressive states kind of sending up trial balloons and not really knowing what's going to happen, which, of course, is going to lead, I think, to more conflict, right? We have people who feel very deeply about this issue acting in an environment of extreme uncertainty. GROSS: You envision a future in which there's three different kinds of states regarding abortion law. What are you envisioning? ZIEGLER: Well, I think, obviously, there are going to be the kind of classic, you know, states that disallow abortion and sometimes go to extremes in enforcing those bans, right? So we may see extensive digital surveillance of people of reproductive age. We may see efforts, as we mentioned, to try to prevent interstate travel. We may see efforts to punish pregnant people directly. There'll be states, of course, very progressive states, that not only allow people in their states to have abortions, but facilitate travel from other states, potentially by providing financial support, by protecting their own physicians against extradition requests or lawsuits. And then there may be, at least for a time, potentially for longer, states that restrict abortion heavily but don't go all the way to ban since (ph) fertilization. And those states, of course, will be battlegrounds where we see lots of money and energy coming in not just from within the state, but nationally. So you can imagine, at least at the moment, Florida is in this category. North Carolina may be in this category. Pennsylvania down the road may be in this category - so usually, what would be kind of politically contested states where politicians are not sure the extent to which they can cater to the anti-abortion movement without alienating their voters. It's unclear, of course, in the long-term future where we'll end up with just two Americas - right? - one where abortion is broadly illegal and one where abortion is proudly legal. But at least in the short term, it appears that there will be these states somewhere in the middle where we'll see a very heated conflict play out. GROSS: You mentioned the possibility of digital surveillance - of who and what kind of surveillance? ZIEGLER: Well, if you stop and think about this - if a state says you can't have an abortion, how will that be enforced? Because we now live in a world where you can get abortion medication on the internet from abroad. And so how would the state of Texas, for example, know if you're doing that? There is, of course - you know, they could try to monitor the mail. There are ways in which the post office, for example, has images of the outside of one's mail, and those are not protected by privacy expectations. But any organization shipping abortion medication is not going to indicate that that's what it's doing on the outside of your mail. So the other way that the government can find out what you're doing is maybe informants, right? We've seen bounty schemes in Texas. And the third way, of course, is digital surveillance. So we know that law enforcement, like customs and immigration control, have, at times, purchased data from various digital service providers, like apps, that can sell that data to law enforcement the same way they can - or at least claim the right to do so - the same right they - to sell data to anyone else. They can get warrants. And so what might that data look like? Well, if you search for abortion on Google - right? - if you have - you know, you take an Uber, and there's data from that app about where you went. There's the GPS data on your phone. There are your unencrypted text messages - a variety of things like that the government may use to try to figure out who's having an abortion. And then, of course, that would - could potentially sweep pretty broadly, right? I mean, if you're thinking about how anyone would know people were having abortions, they would have to be surveying a group of people much broader than those who ultimately would turn out to be seeking abortions. GROSS: Well, talk about the right to privacy. Doesn't that violate the right to privacy if the government is surveilling you and, you know, gathering your private information, especially if it's medically related? ZIEGLER: Potentially, right? But I think this speaks to a broader problem with digital privacy, which is that there - at times, we've seen courts and other government actors essentially say, you should know that you don't have an expectation of privacy when you type something in the Google search bar because, you know, Google's been selling that data to a variety of actors for a long time. So, I mean, this may be a wake-up call for many Americans, not just about privacy when it comes to abortion or contraception, but when it comes to privacy more broadly because I think we'll see people realizing that they may not have the privacy in their digital data that they thought they did. GROSS: Are there new consequences that you think abortion providers will be facing in the future in red states? ZIEGLER: Well, I imagine that abortion providers in red states will either have to close shop or face significant prison terms, right? We've seen states treating abortion as a serious crime, subject to punishment from anywhere from one year in prison to life in prison. So most abortion providers - if we take Texas as a model, given that it passed the SB 8 law that allowed abortion providers to be sued, what happened there, for the most part, was that abortion providers just stopped offering procedures after the sixth week of pregnancy. So I would expect that in red states, most abortion providers will just close up shop. Those who continue will face really serious consequences, including imprisonment, including fines and including the loss of their medical licenses. It's worth noting, too, that it's not just providers who are facing these consequences potentially in the short term. Some states are also including criminal punishment for people who aid or abet people seeking abortions. So those could be abortion funds and groups that help low-income people pay for abortions. It could be family members who help to pay for abortions. So the kind of criminal dragnet is going to be broader than just doctors, although doctors are definitely the ones who are in the crosshairs the most. GROSS: Let's talk about punishing women who have an abortion. As you've pointed out in your writing, you know, in the past, it's mostly been abortion providers who have been targeted with, you know, any kind of criminal punishment. But now it looks like we're opening up the possibility in some states of criminalizing women who have abortions. Where do we stand on that? ZIEGLER: So at the moment, pretty much all red states have said they're not going to punish women, and they're sticking to it. Most of the big anti-abortion groups are saying the same thing. But we're still seeing movement. So there's a group of people who identify as abortion abolitionists. They've written kind of model bills that they're pushing in a variety of states that would punish women. And I think they have momentum because it's going to be much harder for red states to punish doctors in blue states than it is to be - going to be to punish the women who live in their own states and work in their own states and raise their families in their own states. I don't know who's going to have the upper hand in those struggles. But in recent weeks, for example, the state of Louisiana advanced a bill that would have punished women. It was eventually killed or - not killed, but that piece of the bill was done away with. But we know that this is not the end of the story and that people who want to punish women have greater influence in the movement than they have in decades. GROSS: Well, let me reintroduce you again. If you're just joining us, my guest is Mary Ziegler. She's written extensively about the abortion wars, including in several books. Her latest book is called \"Dollars For Life: The Anti-Abortion Movement And The Fall Of The Republican Establishment.\" We'll be right back after a short break. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF FRED HERSCH'S \"A RIDDLE SONG\") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I am Terry Gross. Let's get back to my interview with Mary Ziegler. She's written extensively about the abortion wars. Her new book is called \"Dollars For Life: The Anti-Abortion Movement And The Fall Of The Republican Establishment.\" It's about how the anti-abortion movement became so powerful in the Republican Party and, in the process, weakened the Republican establishment and opened the doors to insurgents and populists like Donald Trump. She's a professor of law at the University of California, Davis. So I've read news stories and heard in FRESH AIR interviews about women who have been punished because they had a miscarriage, but they were accused of aborting their fetus. So what do you know about how that has been done in the past and what that might mean for the future? ZIEGLER: So even with Roe on the books, we know that people were getting punished for conduct during pregnancy. They punished people under laws regulating what states call feticide, or the killing of fetuses. They've regulated pregnant women under laws governing child abuse. And this has happened in contexts involving people who've gotten into fights that have resulted in miscarriages, drug use during pregnancy. So it's worth emphasizing that even if we don't get to a world where red states say they're going to punish women and officially punish women, there may still be pregnant people who are getting punished anyway. And of course, it's important to remember who's getting punished in those situations, which unsurprisingly, tends to be people who are in more heavily policed communities, who are more likely to come into law - contact with law enforcement for other reasons. So there are kind of two ways that we could see people getting punished - one, in this more sort of stealth way that is not something states promote but are happy to carry out, and in a more formal way. And that's especially true when laws are unclear. And then, there's discretion given to sheriffs, to prosecutors, to other people to interpret who exactly they have the authority to punish. GROSS: In the late '80s and early '90s, there were major blockades of clinics that provided abortions. And, you know, it was - it made it very difficult for women to enter. Why was that a tactic that was used? And why was that tactic eventually downplayed? It assumed less importance, less emphasis. ZIEGLER: Well, there were people in the movement who were not happy to just rely on law and politics. They wanted to prevent abortions right now even if that meant breaking the law. And so the clinic blockade movement appealed to people who wanted to say, I've done something to stop abortion today. So quite literally, groups of people would barricade entrances to clinics. They would do this sometimes with the explicit goal of being arrested in the hopes of clogging the court system with so many cases that the courts would feel they had to reverse Roe. And this was a pretty powerful technique from the late '80s to the early '90s. It's also worth emphasizing that these people were - Operation Rescue was a pretty explicitly religious movement. This was not framed as a kind of secular human rights movement the way we sometimes think or hear anti-abortion activists speaking. This was framed as an explicitly Christian, even explicitly evangelical Protestant, cause. Why I think it died down was a combination of law. So in 1994, Congress passed a statute that really toughened penalties for people who used force and intimidation to prevent people from entering clinics. And so some of the people who'd been involved in blockades on a more casual basis weren't willing to face that kind of consequence and dropped out of the movement. The people who were left were sometimes more hardcore not just about blockades, but about the use of violence against clinics and even against doctors. And that kind of radicalization turned off some people from the blockade movement, delegitimized it in the eyes of many. And it, for a time, seems to have faded away. Some of the people who were involved in the clinic blockade movement are the ones today who'd see themselves as abolitionists and are calling for the punishment of women. GROSS: Take us back to a time when the Republican establishment didn't care much about abortion. ZIEGLER: Well, the most striking time really was during the late '80s and early '90s. You had Lee Atwater, who was the famous sort of hatchet man for George H.W. Bush, declaring that the Republican Party was a big tent, encouraging the formation of Republicans for Choice. Internally, in the White House, George H.W. Bush was writing his aides, and they were writing him that it would be a disaster for Bush if Roe were overturned because it would put him in the position of having to support fetal rights, which Bush saw as a political loser. There was a time, I think, really quite some time, when Republicans wondered if aligning with the anti-abortion movement and particularly doing things that actually helped the anti-abortion movement was hurting the party politically. And so there were times when you saw Republican leaders trying to have it both ways, really, kind of courting anti-abortion voters but doing as little as possible to actually please them so as to potentially not alienate other voting blocs. GROSS: The anti-abortion movement tried several strategies to get a better foothold within the party. What are some of the strategies that didn't quite work? ZIEGLER: Well, I think that - the movement had held out the idea that being pro-life, as the movement put it, was good politics because many voters were pro-life. So in the '80s, there had been just the formation of pro-life PACs, or political action committees. There were get-out-the-vote campaigns. But I think there was a general feeling within the movement that if Republicans were in office, first, the thought was there would be a constitutional amendment banning abortion. And then, that didn't work, so the thought was if Republicans are in office, they'll nominate good people to the Supreme Court, and they'll vote to confirm them. But then 1992 rolled around, and you had six Supreme Court justices nominated by Republicans. And nevertheless, the court did not overturn Roe. So that left abortion opponents with a couple of conclusions. They realized it wasn't enough to get regular people to care about the Supreme Court, which had been one of the movement's great accomplishes to that point. More would have to be done to control who the GOP actually picked to be on the court, and that would require, at least some of the people in the anti-abortion movement thought, money - right? - the ability to give more to Republican candidates, help Republican candidates raise more so they could win. And that launched the anti-abortion movement into an existing war to deregulate campaign spending and deregulate it in particular in a way that would facilitate spending not by political parties, but by outsiders like the anti-abortion movement itself. GROSS: Well, the Citizens United Supreme Court decision opened up the doors to all kinds of spending on campaigns that wasn't allowed before. Did the anti-abortion movement help create a path to Citizens United? ZIEGLER: Yeah. The anti-abortion movement was involved in key cases leading up to Citizens United and in Citizens United itself. And what's really interesting was that it wasn't so much that anti-abortion lawyers had a brilliant plan that worked out exactly as expected in Citizens United. In fact, the anti-abortion movement litigated a lot of Citizens United, but their plan was to focus on dark money and anonymous donations because they thought increasingly that if their positions were unpopular, donors, especially in blue states or purple states, would want secrecy as a condition of opening their wallets. That argument obviously didn't work. The Supreme Court instead focused on spending by corporations. But the anti-abortion movement not only had a hand in the foundation of Citizens United, they also capitalized on this unexpected opportunity, which was essentially they realized that corporations don't just include for-profit businesses, they also include nonprofits like many anti-abortion groups. And they realized that this kind of new surge in outside spending on elections could change the balance of power in the GOP. So the traditional party establishment, which had much - usually had much, much, much more money to spend on campaigns than outside groups, that balance might shift, and that the GOP leadership may have less control over some of the outside money that was coming into elections in a way that the anti-abortion movement hoped would be promising. GROSS: All right. There's still plenty more to talk about, but let's take a short break here. If you're just joining us, my guest is Mary Ziegler, who's written several books about the abortion wars. Her new one is called \"Dollars For Life: The Anti-abortion Movement And The Fall Of The Republican Establishment.\" We'll be back after a short break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to my interview with Mary Ziegler. She's written extensively about the abortion wars. Her new book is called \"Dollars for Life: The Anti-Abortion Movement And The Fall Of The Republican Establishment.\" It's about how the anti-abortion movement became so powerful in the Republican Party, and in the process, weakened the GOP establishment and opened the doors to insurgents and populists like Donald Trump. She's a professor of law at the University of California, Davis. We recorded our interview yesterday. One major goal of the anti-abortion movement was to get Supreme Court justices on the bench who would overturn Roe. And as we've seen over the years, abortion became a litmus test for judicial nominees for Republicans. It was justices who would be opposed to abortion. And for Democrats, Democrats started appointing justices who would uphold Roe. What did the anti-abortion movement do to make abortion a litmus test? ZIEGLER: Well, I think the anti-abortion movement's contribution was different than the ones we often hear about. So many of us have heard, for example, of the Federalist Society, which is the sort of flagship of the conservative legal movement. The Federalist Society, for example, provides lists of promising candidates to Republican presidents, from Donald Trump to George W. Bush, this sort of farm league of talent on the right. The anti-abortion movement was not particularly focused on the conservative elites. They were focused on convincing regular people who don't know much about the Supreme Court and don't care much about the law to focus on who sat on the Supreme Court when they voted. So many, many of us remember in 2020, when Donald Trump was going to fill the seat vacated by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, people at his rallies would chant, you know, fill that seat, fill that seat. The sort of regular Americans being that deeply invested in the composition of the Supreme Court, the anti-abortion movement did a lot of work on that, explaining that the Supreme Court was the way you would get rid of Roe and potentially even get to more than that, like a world in which the Supreme Court says there are fetal rights. So that work went on for a long time. And I think there was also an important contribution from the movement in the sense that you see anti-abortion lawyers at some point saying it's not enough to nominate judges who are conservative. It's not enough to nominate judges who are affiliated with the Federalist Society. We need judges who are not worried about controversy because overruling Roe may be unpopular, it may produce backlash. And we need judges who are so committed to their interpretive approaches or their ideological worldview or even, you know, to courting controversy, potentially, that they'll reverse Roe anyway. So there's a lot of attention paid within the movement to Clarence Thomas's confirmation and to the scandal he faced because of sexual harassment allegations involving Anita Hill. That, within the anti-abortion movement, was seen as a good litmus test for the kind of judge Thomas could be. And there was a sense that if there were more people on the bench who didn't care about public outcry, the end of Roe would be that much sooner. So the movement began to focus on finding different kinds of conservative judges, not just people who defined themselves as conservative in the first place. GROSS: A premise of your new book is that the anti-abortion movement led to the downfall of the Republican establishment as it was known in the past. What do you think the key thing was that the anti-abortion movement did to transform the Republican Party? ZIEGLER: Well, part of the story I tell does focus on money. And there were obviously other things that weakened the traditional Republican Party leadership. There was the rise of conservative media. So historically, establishment politicians often have the best connections to the media. So they had more of a platform. But with the rise of conservative talk radio, Fox News, Newsmax and the like, those outlets tended to give a platform to politicians that were the most extreme and the most ideologically pure. And that weakened traditional leaders. The polarization of the electorate has, too. And the same is true of what we call negative partisanship, which is basically when Americans feel negatively about people in the other party and would be unwilling to vote for a candidate from the other party even if they don't like their own nominee. All of those things made a difference. But I argue in the book that money did, too, because in the past, the GOP establishment had been able to use its spending advantage, right - this was particularly through the party organizations - to crush populists like Pat Buchanan in the 1990s. And after Citizens United, spending was much more diffused. So you had nonprofits spending lots of money, super PACs spending lots of money, parties spending lots of money. So populists like Donald Trump had more of a safety net even when the traditional leadership didn't want them to be at the top of the ticket. They didn't have a kind of bailout from their spending advantage to get rid of those populists anymore. And some of that - a lot of that was because of work the anti-abortion movement had done to change the way our campaign spending works. GROSS: When Donald Trump was running for president in 2016, he put a really big emphasis on appointing Supreme Court justices who would try to overturn Roe. And that, of course, was very appealing to people in the anti-abortion movement. Why do you think he put such an emphasis on that? ZIEGLER: Part of the reason Trump put such an emphasis on that was because people in the anti-abortion movement really didn't like him at the beginning in 2016. There were plenty of moments when you had letters from women in the anti-abortion movement and during the primary season saying, literally, vote for anybody but Donald Trump (laughter). Write in anyone but Donald Trump. And Trump had, of course, you know, a personal life that might not have appealed to people in the anti-abortion movement, had a record of being pro-choice. And so I think he felt that he needed to do more to prove his pro-life or anti-abortion bona fides, and other politicians did. He also, I think, in office, recognized that he was, you know, unusually unpopular as a president, had historically low poll numbers and therefore had to do more to rev up his base to turn out the people who already liked him. And in that way, I think, the anti-abortion movement was quite happy with him because there were many within the movement, after he became the party's candidate in 2016, saying, essentially, maybe it's not a bad thing that this guy is unpopular because we haven't fared well when we've had very popular Republican candidates, who do things that we want only when they feel like it because they don't need us. Maybe it's not a bad thing to have someone who needs us and therefore lets us call the shots. So there was a feeling that Donald Trump might be that person. GROSS: Let's take a short break here, and then we'll talk some more. If you're just joining us, my guest is Mary Ziegler, who's written several books about the abortion wars, including her new one, \"Dollars For Life: The Anti-Abortion Movement And The Fall Of The Republican Establishment.\" We'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF PATTI SMITH SONG, \"WITHIN YOU WITHOUT YOU\") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to my interview with Mary Ziegler. She's written extensively about the abortion wars. Her new book is called \"Dollars For Life: The Anti-Abortion Movement And The Fall Of The Republican Establishment.\" It's about how the anti-abortion movement became so powerful in the Republican Party and, in the process, weakened the Republican establishment and opened the doors to insurgents and populists, like Donald Trump. She's a professor of law at the University of California, Davis. Our interview was recorded yesterday. The Supreme Court has been releasing its opinions online this year. And to what extent do you think that's because of COVID precautions? And to what extent is that protecting the safety of the justices, especially after the death threat against Justice Kavanaugh? ZIEGLER: I think it's a number of things. I mean, I think that the court is moving more quickly and much more radically on a variety of issues that people actually pay attention to than it has in decades. And I think that has intensified threats against the justices and raised legitimate safety concerns. It also seems to have really fundamentally eroded norms and collegiality within the court. And it's increased the odds of, you know, legitimate public anger at the court - not death threats, not violence, but just public backlash. And I think there is a sense within the court that the court is not functioning as it usually does. Law clerks are being watched closely to see if they had any involvement in the leak. So they're not able to kind of foster collegiality and make everything run smoothly the way they historically have been. The justices, I think, are suspicious and uncomfortable with one another. So I think that they're symptoms both of a court that doesn't want to deal with the kinds of consequences that will come with announcing divisive decisions on abortion or guns or environmental regulations, and a court that's having some kind of institutional breakdown of kinds - right? - a court that isn't functioning the way we would have come to expect. And that's something that's concerning beyond the abortion context, too, both because if the court's not able to operate at full speed, that's not good. And if the court continues to lose the trust of the public, that's not good. We've seen an erosion of trust in democratic institutions in the United States. The court had been the outlier, right? The court had been the institution that more Americans liked. We've already seen as early as this last fall the court having the lowest polling numbers it's had in the history of that question being asked, and I expect those numbers to go down much, much further. So I think there's an awareness on the court that the public's not going to be happy with a lot of what's going to happen. And the court is trying, I think, in a way to insulate itself from that, which I don't think will be successful. GROSS: You were in law school in the late aughts. When you decided to make abortion an area of specialization for your legal scholarship, did you envision the possibility that Roe could be overturned? ZIEGLER: In law school, it would have come as sort of unimaginable to me that Roe would be overturned. I think the more I studied this, the more I came to appreciate the sophistication of the anti-abortion movement. This is something I think many of us still miss. So now, when people ask me, you know, how is this happening, what's going on, the follow-up question is always, what did progressives do wrong? It's never, what did conservatives do right? And so I think the more I came to appreciate that these were strategies that were changing basic things about how our elections work, I came to see that it was more possible that Roe would be overturned because there were a lot of smart people doing a lot of fairly sweeping things to get to the moment when Roe is gone. And so I think it's less of a surprise to me now, even though there's still - I think even though I know that, it still feels surreal, right? I think I'm kind of operating in those two very different mental spaces - right? - where this seems almost inevitable, but also impossible at the same time. GROSS: Well, you walked me right into the question. What do you think progressives did wrong? ZIEGLER: Right. Well, I think there are a couple of things progressives did wrong. I think there was a kind of professionalization of the pro-choice movement - right? a kind of effort to make the pro-choice movement a kind of smooth political machine - right? - that could focus group everything, pull everything and appeal to what many in the movement believe was a large American pro-choice majority. And I think while that was happening, the grassroots wasn't as engaged and wasn't as effective. This was especially true, I think, because the movement did a pretty poor job of outreach to people of color, even at the same time that the abortion rate in communities of color was higher and became even higher relative to the abortion rate in the white community. I think there were lots of moments when you see the kind of leadership of traditional pro-choice groups like NARAL or Planned Parenthood taking steps that are discouraging people of color from getting involved or making people of color feel that their issues are not as central. And I think that was important. I think there was also a sort of weird way that the progressives handled the courts on this issue, both reflexively challenging everything that would come down through the states in court, but not doing as much to revamp strategy on judicial nominations and getting progressives to care about judges when they go to the polls. I think that effort was somewhat of a mess, too. But the clearest mistake - right? - is underestimating conservatives - right? - not seeing how much conservatives, especially in the anti-abortion movement, which I think was often dismissed as sort of not very advanced, not very savvy. That dismissal obviously was a big mistake. GROSS: Mary Ziegler, thank you so much for talking with us. ZIEGLER: Thanks for having me.

            "article_content": "NPR's Ari Shapiro talks with editor in chief of  The Texas Tribune Sewell Chan about the Texas GOP's convention over the weekend, which was rife with anger and conspiracy theories.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: About 5,000 Texas Republicans came together in Houston this weekend to make decisions about their party's priorities. And some of their positions are striking. The platform declares homosexuality, quote, \"an abnormal lifestyle choice.\" It endorses abolishing the 1965 Voting Rights Act. And the Texas GOP officially holds the false view that President Biden, quote, \"was not legitimately elected.\" Texas Tribune Editor-in-Chief Sewell Chan was reporting at the convention. Welcome to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. SEWELL CHAN: Thank you, Ari. SHAPIRO: There are 275 planks in this platform, and many are noteworthy. Besides the ones I mentioned, there's one that would require Texas students to, quote, \"learn about the humanity of the preborn child.\" Another would remove the legislature's power to regulate guns. These were not part of the state party platform in 2018 or 2020, so why has the party moved so far to the right on so many of these issues? CHAN: Well, one thing that we've noticed is that the party has actually been emboldened since the 2020 election, although President Trump lost that election. Obviously, you know, his narrative of a stolen election has continued to be very, very powerful. There was a sense in 2018 and even in 2020, when the party last formed its platform, that they had to moderate a little bit to meet the center given that Texas Democrats had made some surprising gains in the 2018 midterm elections. But with Biden seen as very unpopular and with the Republicans seen as being in a strong position for this year's midterms, the party has felt really emboldened to appease the far right. SHAPIRO: The party controls the House, Senate, governor's mansion and every statewide office in Texas. So how much of a real-world impact could these extreme declarations have? CHAN: Well, that's it. We have to remember that a platform is not the same as the legislative priorities. You know, Texas Republicans have actually made - have had so many victories on voting, abortion rights, redistricting that, you know, some observers are like, you know, what more could they hope for? And so we have to keep in mind that some of the platform is, you know, again, throwing kind of red meat and not so much specific legislative language. You know, that said, if you zoom out, you know, the platform would take us back to an America that's very different from the one today. It would include repealing the federal income tax; you know, not having U.S. senators directly elected, but rather, you know, elected by state legislatures; and even not having directly elected state officials, but having a kind of state electoral college that would choose the governor and other officers. SHAPIRO: People at the convention also booed one of their state's most powerful Republicans, Senator John Cornyn. What happened? CHAN: Well, it's very striking. And Senator Cornyn, of course, is a George W. Bush-era Republican - in the news a lot for being part of this group of 10 Republican senators, you know, open to a bipartisan framework on gun safety. He was booed on Friday quite loudly. He tried, over many heckles, to kind of actually explain what's in the bipartisan framework and talk about what he would not agree to, which includes restricting the rights of current gun owners. But people weren't having it. SHAPIRO: Just in our last 30 seconds or so, was there much pushback to some of the more extreme positions like the big lie that the 2020 election was stolen? CHAN: Well, there was some. There was pushback against the homosexuality provision. I think, you know, delegates I talked to - frankly, there was a bit of an eyeroll like, you know, as if, you know, we're going to say the election was illegitimate. But that's not really an actionable item. So that's important to keep in mind too, although, of course, the position itself is fairly extreme. SHAPIRO: That's Sewell Chan, editor-in-chief of The Texas Tribune. Thank you so much for talking with us today. CHAN: Thank you, Ari. Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.  All rights reserved.

The Supreme Court's decision in Roe v. Wade transformed the landscape of abortion rights overnight. For the doctors, lawyers, feminists, and others who had fought for nationwide legalization, Roe was the end of a long battle. But for the growing movement against abortion rights, it was the beginning of a new battle: to protect the fetus, challenge abortion providers, and ultimately overturn Roe. This is the story of how opponents of abortion rights banded together, built power, and launched one of the most successful grassroots campaigns of the past century.

Joe Cunningham arrives at a debate for Democrats seeking their party's nomination in South Carolina's governor's race on Friday, June 10, 2022, in Columbia, S.C.\n                \n                    \n                    Meg Kinnard/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Former U.S. Rep. Joe Cunningham arrives at a debate for Democrats seeking their party's nomination in South Carolina's governor's race on Friday, June 10, 2022, in Columbia, S.C. In South Carolina, former Congressman Joe Cunningham has won the Democratic primary for governor, according to a call by The Associated Press. Cunningham will face incumbent Republican Gov. Henry McMaster in November who also won his Tuesday primary, according to the AP. Voters in the deep-red state haven't elected a Democratic governor in nearly 25 years, but Cunningham has a history of upsetting the political status quo. In 2018, he flipped the state's 1st Congressional District red to blue. His tenure lasted only one term before losing to Republican Congresswoman Nancy Mace. For some, though, it's a sign that Cunningham can win against Republicans in South Carolina. Defeating McMaster in November will be a challenge, to say the very least. He's been endorsed by former President Donald Trump and remains popular in the state where Republicans control both houses of the state legislature, both U.S. Senate seats and six out of seven seats in Congress. \"I can tell you it's gonna be a tough race,\" Cunningham said at a Democratic debate Friday, \"but I can tell you that I am up for that challenge.\" Last week, Vice President Kamala Harris appeared at a party fundraiser in Columbia, S.C., and gave Democratic voters and candidates alike an enthusiasm jolt. \"Let us fight to get Democrats up and down state ballots,\" she said. McMaster was the state's lieutenant governor and assumed the office of governor in early 2017 after former President Donald Trump nominated then-Gov. Nikki Haley as ambassador to the United Nations. When it comes to the issues heading into November, Cunningham and McMaster couldn't be further apart: A top issue for Cunningham is Medicaid expansion. South Carolina is one of just 12 states \u2014 most of which are in the south \u2014 that have not expanded Medicaid to individuals up to 138% of the Federal Poverty Level, or $17,774 for an individual in 2021. Doing so in South Carolina would insure approximately 100,000 additional people, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Republicans, including Gov. McMaster, have spent years holding out against expansion. \"Expanding Medicaid would cost the state hundreds of millions of dollars every year,\" the governor wrote on Twitter last year, \"and I will fight any effort to do it here.\" South Carolina has a six-week abortion ban waiting in the wings if Roe v. Wade is overturned. After receiving McMaster's signature, the law was quickly blocked by a federal court and is awaiting a decision from the U.S. Supreme Court. After the draft opinion showing justices were leaning towards reversing Roe leaked from the high court last month, Democrats moved to make abortion a central issue of their campaigns in South Carolina. Cunningham released this ad. \"The stakes in this election could not be higher,\" he says in the video, \"because these healthcare decisions should be between women and their doctors.\" The primary election falls seven years \u2014 nearly to the day \u2014 after nine Black church-goers were killed by a domestic terrorist in Charleston in a racially motivated mass murder. Gun rights remain a key campaign issue for McMaster, who is endorsed by the National Rifle Association. Just last year, the governor signed a law allowing South Carolinians to openly carry their firearms, even with some law enforcement hesitation. \"Our gun violence is out of control,\" Cunningham said at the Democratic debate last week, touting his record of helping to push gun control legislation through the U.S. House. This year, Gov. McMaster quietly signed a bill into law that prevents transgender students from playing girls' or women's sports. At Friday's debate, Cunningham said that the issue should be dealt with using \"compassion\" and \"empathy,\" emphasizing the importance of looking after kids' mental health. \"We need to care for our kids and send a clear message to our politicians to leave our kids alone,\" he said.

Paul LePage will face off for the 2022 election for governor.\n                \n                    \n                    Robert F.

Paul LePage will face off for the 2022 election for governor. AUGUSTA, Maine \u2014 Maine's race for governor will be a three-way contest focused on two longtime rivals, incumbent Democratic Gov. Janet Mills and former Republican Gov. Paul LePage, who have never faced one another in an election. Tuesday is Maine's primary day, but when it comes to the race for governor, the real match-up will be in November. Gov. Mills won the seat in 2018, becoming the first woman elected governor in state history and the first non-incumbent to win an outright majority since 1966. LePage, her predecessor, is a hard-charging conservative whose second term ended in 2018 after multiple controversies that drew national headlines and frequent comparisons to former President Donald Trump. LePage's penchant for testing the limits of his authority were often confronted by Mills, who served as Maine's attorney general for most of his two terms. LePage, as he did when he narrowly won a five-way contest in 2010, is attempting to nationalize the race by focusing on inflation, linking Mills to President Biden, and what he describes as the governor's heavy-handed pandemic response. Mills attempted to address inflation concerns by shepherding a proposal that returned nearly 60% of the state's budget surplus to 858,000 Maine tax filers via direct payments. The proposal won overwhelming bipartisan backing in the legislature, but LePage has pushed for income tax cuts and called the payments a gimmick designed to buy votes in November. Mills is also framing her reelection bid as a fight against the return to LePage-era theatrics and aggressive politics, which included blocking voter-approved bonds and Medicaid expansion, as well as pushing Republican loyalists in the legislature to orchestrate a government shutdown in 2017 \u2014 Maine's first in nearly three decades. Sam Hunkler, a little-known independent who acknowledges that he has malleable and undefined policy positions, is also on the ballot. Mills has campaigned infrequently but leads LePage in campaign cash. However, the Republican has never been a prolific fundraiser and he has won every election he's run in. Outside groups like the Republican Governors Association and Democratic Governors Association are expected to be active in the race. Both groups are routing their influence campaigns through local political committees in a state where outsiders \u2014 and outside campaign spending \u2014 are often viewed suspiciously. Public polling has been infrequent, but recent surveys show a tight race with Maine's famously independent and persuadable voters potentially determining the winner. The surveys show strong Republican support for LePage, a popular figure in the local GOP dominated by Trump supporters. The former governor was Trump's state campaign chairman in 2020, but he's made little mention of the former president during a rebranding effort designed to win over independent voters who turned on Trump two years ago and helped make Biden the statewide winner. Mills has governed as a centrist, refusing to raise taxes and opposing some progressive initiatives in the Democratic-controlled legislature. Some of her positions, including opposition to a sweeping initiative that would have recognized the sovereignty of Maine's Native American tribes, have irked activists on her left flank. At the same time, Mills has expressed strong support for abortion rights, a position that could help her close a potential enthusiasm gap with LePage if the U.S. Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade. Maine voters rarely unseat incumbent governors. The last time it happened was in 1966. More Maine primary coverage",

Ron DeSantis to be Florida's new secretary of state, an appointment that has drawn criticism.\n                \n                    \n                    Steve Cannon/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Former state Rep. Cord Byrd, seen here in March 2020, was tapped by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis to be Florida's new secretary of state, an appointment that has drawn criticism. Florida's Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, recently tapped one of his allies in the Florida House to become the new secretary of state. The new elections chief, Cord Byrd, has a history of sparring with Democrats and, when asked, he has refused to say Joe Biden won the 2020 presidential election. Voting rights advocates and some Democrats in the state say they are worried that Byrd's appointment could make the office less independent. Before his selection for the new role, Byrd was one of the more right-wing members of the Florida House. And Abdelilah Skhir, with the ACLU of Florida, says Byrd sponsored some of the most divisive legislation in the past few years. \"This is someone who has sponsored in the past the anti-protest bill HB 1 in 2021, sponsored the anti-voter bills that passed in 2021 and 2022 \u2014 he sponsored the House versions of those bills \u2014 the trans athlete ban, anti-immigrant legislation,\" he says. Skhir says Byrd also sponsored Florida's controversial Parental Rights in Education legislation, which has been derisively dubbed the \"Don't Say Gay\" bill by opponents. He also sponsored a 15-week abortion ban, as well as legislation prohibiting schools and employers from discussing race. One of Byrd's former colleagues, Democratic state Rep. Angie Nixon of Jacksonville, says it wasn't just his policies that were divisive, either. She says Byrd had a hard time keeping his composure and collegiality during debates \u2014 especially when those debates were coming from the other side of the aisle. In at least one instance, Nixon says, Byrd \"cussed\" at members of the Black caucus while on the Florida House floor. \"The way he made arguments and debates on the floor, it really made many of my Black colleagues and myself uncomfortable with some of the things that he said,\" she says. Byrd's office says the allegations that he cursed aren't true. Democratic Florida state Rep. Angie Nixon is one of the lawmakers speaking out against Byrd's appointment.\n                \n                    \n                    Phil Sears/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Byrd's allies say concerns over his appointment are overblown. Republican state Rep. Randy Fine of Brevard County says he and Byrd were among the few lawmakers in Florida who weren't afraid to challenge views or comments they thought were wrong. \"Unfortunately, the woke left defines any conservative who fights as a bully, because that's what they use as a weapon to try to silence the right,\" Fine says. \"It doesn't work with someone like me or Secretary Byrd.\" But critics of Byrd say his is not an ideal temperament for someone whose job it is to possibly settle disputes in a state that often has very close elections. \"It seems as though the governor chose someone who he knew was going to do his bidding,\" Nixon says. \"I think someone who may have already been a judge \u2014 or someone who had previously been a supervisor of elections \u2014 would have been great for this job, but not someone who is as uber-partisan as Cord Byrd is.\" In a statement, the Florida secretary of state's office said allegations that Byrd will act as a partisan \"are simply not true and have been repeatedly addressed.\" \"This is a false narrative that appears to be perpetuated by inaccurate or incomplete news stories and by partisan political attacks,\" the office said. \"The Secretary of State's office is nonpartisan and will not respond to those allegations.\" Byrd said in a statement to NPR that he has \"always advocated for the rule of law, and now serving as Florida's Secretary of State, that will not change\" in his new position. \"I think he shares a lot of the same views as the governor,\" Fine says of Byrd. \"But I don't think it's because he is being told what to do. I think it's because it's what he believes. And look, if Democrats want a Democrat to be secretary of state, they need to win some elections.\" Florida is among the minority of states where voters don't get to choose who runs their elections. Instead, in Florida and some other states, like Pennsylvania and Texas, the elections chief is appointed by the governor. Floridians used to vote for a secretary of state until about two decades ago, when a ballot measure switched the position to one appointed by the governor. Daniel Smith, a political science professor at the University of Florida, says that has meant all secretaries of state since then have been appointed by Republicans and have ties to the party in some way. \"We have had a mixed history here in Florida of secretary of states who have tried to toe a little independence and those that have veered over into becoming effectively a pawn of the governor,\" he says. Byrd has stepped into this position at a time when Republicans and Democrats are at serious odds about how elections should be run. Like many other GOP-led states over the past two years, Florida lawmakers have passed new voting laws that Democrats say will make it harder for people to vote. A 2021 law created new restrictions on mail-in voting, drop boxes and third-party voter registration efforts. And Skhir, of the ACLU of Florida, says there's concern among voting groups over a law enacted this year that creates a new election crimes unit. \"And that will be overseen by the secretary of state, who is not an elected position,\" he says. \"And our main concern around this office is that there is no guardrail to ensure that under any administration it couldn't become a political tool.\" So far, there are not a lot of details about the election crimes unit and how it will be run. Byrd says he plans to hire data analysts, investigators and law enforcement once a director is in place. High-profile Democrats in the state have already asked the federal government to look into Florida officials in light of Byrd's appointment, though. Nikki Fried, the state's agriculture and consumer services commissioner, recently sent a letter to the U.S. Department of Justice asking officials to \"closely monitor the election-related actions of Florida officials and take appropriate federal action if necessary.\" Fried, who is currently a Democratic candidate for governor, wrote that the combination of restrictive new voting laws, new political maps that she says disenfranchise Black Floridians and Byrd's appointment is \"startling.\" \"He believes in 'nationwide irregularities' in the 2020 presidential election and still refuses to acknowledge whether President Biden officially won,\" she wrote. \"These qualities matched with the newfound voter suppression powers granted to the Secretary of State by S.B. 90 create an environment rife for voting abuse.\" Similarly, Democratic Congressman Charlie Crist \u2014 a former Florida governor who is running again for the office this year \u2014 also asked DOJ officials to \"consider using all available authorities and resources to protect the rights of Florida voters.\" Crist said the scope of the new election crimes unit \"is purposefully vague and undefined, and provides those under the purview of the Governor's office with unilateral authority and virtually no guardrails.\" A lack of guardrails in general is something that Smith, with the University of Florida, says worries him. He says in the last few years the courts have sided with state officials curtailing voting rights in the state. So, even if Democrats and voting groups were to sue to stop alleged voting rights violations, it is unlikely the courts will step in. \"I think it sends a very scary signal that these elections and those who are ultimately going to be deciding the rules and umpiring are ultimately one and the same,\" he says.",

            "article_content": "Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin is attempting a political comeback in a special election for her state's lone House seat. The top four candidates in Saturday's primary will advance.  AILSA CHANG, HOST: Alaska has been a state for six decades - for five of them, it was represented in the U.S. House by one man, Republican Don Young. He died in March. Now, Sarah Palin wants that office. She's among 48 people vying for Alaska's single House seat in a primary tomorrow. Alaska Public Media's Liz Ruskin reports. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Yeah. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: How are you? I've missed you. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: We need to form a line. LIZ RUSKIN, BYLINE: In a race this crowded, name recognition matters. And Palin has it. Fans lined up to have their picture taken with her at a campaign rally in Anchorage that featured Donald Trump by telephone. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DONALD TRUMP: She did a phenomenal job and really became a MAGA warrior. And to this day, that's what she is. RUSKIN: After she resigned as governor in 2009, Palin became a Fox News contributor and a reality TV star. But at the rally, Palin let it be known she's a regular Alaskan. She name-checked local supermarkets and, as she took aim at high gas prices, emphasized that she drives a pickup. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) SARAH PALIN: My F-150, 140 bucks out there in Wasilla to fuel it up, the F-150. And it's not even the hottest, souped-up model either. But I know you guys, too. You see that every time you fuel up. RUSKIN: For all her celebrity, Palin has what pollsters call high negatives in Alaska. Even some conservatives resent the national attention her campaign gets, but few doubt she'll survive the special primary. That's because in Alaska's new election system, the top four vote-getters of any party will advance. Also, this special election to fill the vacancy overlaps with the regular election for the next congressional term, with a lot of the same candidates. There's another conservative in the race with a familiar name, sort of. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) NICK BEGICH III: Nick Begich here, running for Congress for the state of Alaska. RUSKIN: That's Nick Begich III. His grandfather, the first Nick Begich, was Alaska's congressman before Don Young. Nick III has an uncle who was a U.S. senator and another who's a state senator. But those Begichs are Democrats. At a candidate forum, Begich credited his mother's side of the family for his party affiliation. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BEGICH: And a lot of people ask, well how in the heck does a Begich become a Republican? A raised Republican, by grandparents who were Bible Belt, Southern Republicans from Southeast Missouri. RUSKIN: Begich doesn't have Trump's endorsement, but he has substantial support from Trump-loving conservatives. It's become an Alaska parlor game to guess who else makes it to the final four. It could be surgeon and commercial fisherman Al Gross. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) AL GROSS: I'm Al Gross. I'm not a Democrat or a Republican. RUSKIN: Gross highlights his support for abortion rights and favors more Alaska oil production. On the far left is a candidate named Santa Claus. How's that for name recognition? He looks like Father Christmas and serves as mayor of North Pole, near Fairbanks. Years ago, he changed his legal name to Santa Claus. He's one of the few candidates who unequivocally opposes drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. SANTA CLAUS: I say leave it alone. Defend the sacred to protect the Arctic Refuge. RUSKIN: Claus is only running in the special. He says Alaska needs a full-time House member for the rest of the year, not someone still on the campaign trail. CLAUS: I'd be in there over the holiday season, and I think a lot of children will get kind of a kick out of it. RUSKIN: Pollsters say there's a decent chance Santa Claus and Sarah Palin make it past the primary this weekend. Reporting from Anchorage, I'm Liz Ruskin for NPR News. Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.

Abby Finkenauer stops for a portrait on her way into a Buchanan County Democratic Party fundraiser in Quasqueton, Iowa, on April 29. Finkenauer is now one of three Democrats seeking her party's nomination for U.S. Senate. Seven states hold primaries on Tuesday, including Iowa, where three Democrats are competing to challenge longtime Republican U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley. One of those vying for that chance is former Rep. Abby Finkenauer, who defeated a Republican incumbent in 2018 and then served in the U.S. House of Representatives for just one term before losing her reelection bid two years ago. Now, at age 33, Finkenauer is facing a tougher-than-expected U.S. Senate primary in a state that has become more of a GOP stronghold in the last decade. Finkenauer regularly points out generational differences between her and Grassley, who is 88 years old, when talking on the campaign trail about issues like abortion rights, college debt and gun restrictions. On the day after the mass shooting at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, Finkenauer made a campaign stop in the Mississippi River town of Dubuque. She talked about how she's lived most of her life with school shootings happening in America. \"I was 10 years old when Columbine happened,\" Finkenauer said to a small crowd gathered at Dimensional Brewing. \"Sen. Grassley had already been in Washington, D.C., at that point for 23 years.\" She told the crowd they already know where she stands on guns, like when she \"proudly voted for H.R. 8 closing the background check loophole and also supporting red flag laws.\" Voters like Tom Townesend want Finkenauer back in Washington. He introduced her at the Dubuque campaign stop. \"The whole time she was in Congress she was working on issues that are important to building trades,\" said Townesend, who is with a local electrical workers union. \"She has always been a great friend to union people.\" But Finkenauer has had some setbacks in this race. She almost didn't make it onto the primary ballot after a pair of Republican activists challenged her nominating petitions. It went all the way up to the Iowa Supreme Court. Also, one of her two opponents is staying competitive in his fundraising numbers. Retired U.S. Navy Adm. Mike Franken takes questions from voters about foreign policy during an event hosted by the S.T.A.R PAC in Des Moines on May 31. Franken also ran unsuccessfully for a different U.S. Senate seat in Iowa in 2020.\n                \n                    \n                    Clay Masters/Iowa Public Radio\n                    \n                \nhide caption Retired Navy Adm. Mike Franken served in the military for nearly 40 years and came back to Iowa ahead of the 2020 election and ran unsuccessfully for his party's nomination in a different U.S. Senate race. The 64-year-old says he decided to throw his hat in the ring again, for this contest, following the insurrection on Jan. 6, 2021. \"Having worked overseas and defended the American way of life and worked for this country so hard, I thought as life becomes more compressed over the age of 60, things that you do are more meaningful,\" Franken said. \"I can't think of anything more meaningful than to provide my expertise to maintain democracy in this country, because I saw it under threat.\" Al Simon is voting for Franken. Simon came to see Franken take questions from voters about foreign policy at an event in Des Moines last week. He thinks Franken is better equipped to beat Grassley. \"I think Grassley's been there too long,\" Simon said. \"And I've been in the military so I respect Franken for being an admiral.\" But Democrats have lost a lot of ground in Iowa over the last decade, especially in rural Iowa. The third candidate, Glenn Hurst, is a physician and city council member from a small town in western Iowa. He's running as a more progressive candidate and makes the case for his party not to keep elevating moderates to run for statewide office. \"If you keep doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results, that's insanity,\" Hurst said, paraphrasing Albert Einstein. \"I think we've got to do something different. Otherwise, we're gonna have the same results.\" Both Franken and Finkenauer say Democrats have struggled in rural Iowa in part because so many residents are plugged into right-wing echo chambers. Both were running in 2020 and say the information environment was made worse when the pandemic was new and Democrats weren't out campaigning like Republicans. \"We didn't know what to do because we're in the middle of this pandemic,\" Finkenauer said. \"We didn't know could we go door to door [and] what was safe, what wasn't. In the meantime, folks spent a lot of time in places like Facebook. And so the misinformation was really, really thick.\" This year, in-person political activities are back across Iowa and local activists like Dan Callahan, who chairs the Democratic Party in rural Buchanan County, say that will keep voters engaged. \"These people are energized,\" Callahan said during a Buchanan County fundraiser in late April, where candidates spoke to dozens of supporters. \"They'll come to the meetings, donate money, volunteer, make the phone calls [and] knock on the doors, which we weren't allowed to do last time.\" Even though Democrats have a playbook that feels more like business-as-usual, whoever wins the primary will likely face a tough race in November. Grassley, who faces minor opposition in the GOP primary, is running for his eighth term in the U.S. Senate to represent a state that Republicans have tightened their grip on in recent elections.",

Kim Reynolds and Democratic candidate for governor Deidre DeJear. DES MOINES, Iowa \u2014 Even though Iowa is one of 36 states with a race for governor this November, voters won't get to choose between different candidates for governor in Tuesday's primary. On the Republican side, incumbent Gov. Kim Reynolds is running unopposed, with a late-in-the-primary endorsement from former President Donald Trump. Reynolds became governor in 2017 and has worked with the Republican-led legislature to enact a very conservative agenda. They've drastically cut income taxes, rolled back gun regulations, passed abortion restrictions and cut the amount of time allowed for voting. \"On top of that, she has relatively strong standing in recent polls where her approval rating within the state is above 50%,\" says Chris Larimer, a political science professor at the University of Northern Iowa. \"She's particularly popular among Republican voters and so I think that would deter any sort of challenger.\" Democrats go into the primary with an uncontested ticket, too, after state Rep. Ras Smith dropped out of the race. Smith cited difficulty with fundraising and said major political donors in the state refused to meet with him. He wrote in a news release: \"Unfortunately, this process has also exposed a drastic disconnect between the current political system and the people.\" Smith, who is Black, was officially recognized as a rising star in the Iowa Democratic Party and successfully pushed the Republican-led legislature to pass policing reforms in 2020. That leaves Deidre DeJear, the Democrats' solo candidate, who also appeared to struggle with campaign donations last year. Her campaign ended 2021 with about $8,500 in the bank. She has raised a lot more money since then. DeJear is a business owner who ran for Iowa secretary of state in 2018 and was the first Black candidate to be nominated for statewide office in Iowa. DeJear was also Vice President Harris' Iowa campaign chair ahead of the 2020 presidential caucuses. Gov. Reynolds still got out on the campaign trail last week to support candidates she endorsed in GOP legislative primaries. In a rare move, Reynolds has endorsed opponents of incumbent Republican lawmakers who refused to vote for one of her policy goals: creating state-funded scholarships for private school expenses. Larimer, the political science professor at the University of Northern Iowa, says the predictions about this being a bad election year for Democrats and Reynolds' strong position as an incumbent could be why there aren't other candidates in the primary. \"You don't want to come out and then really have to face a very difficult election in the fall and not do well,\" Larimer says. \"And then does that hurt your long-term political prospects?\" As for third-party candidates, Libertarian Rick Stewart temporarily suspended his campaign in May after he was arrested at a protest in Washington, D.C., calling for the medical use of psilocybin.",

Gavin Newsom cruised to a solid first-place finish in the primary election for governor, according to The Associated Press. He will face off against Republican state Sen. Brian Dahle in the fall, making Newsom the prohibitive favorite to win a second four-year term. Under California's \"top two\" primary system, the first and second-place finishers in all statewide races, regardless of party, face off in November. The margin of the governor's first-place finish Tuesday was in many ways foreshadowed by the ease with which he beat back last year's effort to recall him mid-way through his third year in office. Last September, 62% of California voters voted \"No\" on the recall, essentially identical to the 62% who voted for Newsom over Republican challenger John Cox in the 2018 gubernatorial election. Like elected officials at all levels, Newsom is facing headwinds from the pandemic, gas prices and inflation, in addition to voter concerns about quality of life issues including homelessness and public safety. But Newsom's campaign ads remained mostly positive, like one touting his \"Courage Through Crisis\" where he focused on California's resilience, with a promise to reflect the state's values, like diversity protecting the environment and following science.

Brian Dahle speaks at the Capitol in Sacramento, Calif., March 30, 2022. Dahle will face Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom in the November election for governor. Newsom overcame lingering unhappiness with his handling of the pandemic and other problems, notably the Employment Development Department's epic mishandling of the federally-funded Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program, where EDD paid some $20 billion in fraudulent unemployment claims and gummed up payments to those in need while investigations took place. As the incumbent in a solidly Democratic state, Newsom benefited from an overwhelming financial advantage over his rivals. Through May, the Newsom for Governor campaign had $23 million cash on hand, most of it raised last year when Newsom faced a recall. By comparison, Sen. Dahle had just $392,485 in the bank at the end of May. Dahle represents a sprawling state senate district that includes all or part of 11 mostly rural counties. He won the endorsement of the state Republican Party and is in sync with many of its positions, including opposition to abortion, saying climate change is not the primary cause of California's wildfires and blaming voter-approved ballot measures for the recent uptick in property crime. His positions and campaign slogan, \"Restoring California,\" may appeal to the 24% of voters registered as Republican, but he is unlikely to approach the percentage needed to win in November.",

Kristi Noem speaks during the Conservative Political Action Conference CPAC held at the Hilton Anatole on July 11, 2021 in Dallas, Texas. PIERRE, S.D. - Kristi Noem, the incumbent Republican governor of South Dakota, has won the GOP primary over Steve Haugaard, the former Speaker of the state House, according to The Associated Press. Since the pandemic, Noem's hands-off approach to COVID-19 has elevated her national profile and heightened her approval within the state. She's known for her conservative politics on guns, abortion, taxes and other social issues and is a close ally of former President Donald Trump. She even hosted a 4th of July fireworks show at Mount Rushmore with him in 2020 and received his endorsement for governor earlier this year. Noem said she's thankful for getting the nomination again. \"And now, with your support, we're going to have the chance to go to a November election and make sure that we're pushing back on Joe Biden's America and what he's doing to this country,\" Noem said at an election watch party in Sioux Falls. Noem's record and incumbency served her well. Heading into Tuesday, 61% of likely Republican voters said they preferred Noem, according to a recent poll from South Dakota State University. \"We've got an incumbent governor who is extremely popular within her own party,\" says Jon Schaff, a political science professor at Northern State University in Aberdeen, S.D. Her confidence in the race showed throughout the campaign. She hardly engaged with Haugaard during the primary; the two candidates never debated. She also outraised and outspent her opponent. Still, Haugaard said he thought he saw an opening in the race. In the 2018 primary for governor, Noem narrowly defeated Republican Marty Jackley. And in the general election, she won 51% of the vote to Democrat Bille Sutton's 48%. Tuesday, Republican voters overwhelmingly nominated her for the general election. Noem will face House Minority Leader Jamie Smith, a Democrat from Sioux Falls then. Libertarian Tracey Quint is also running for governor. In the U.S. Senate race, incumbent John Thune also handily won his primary Tuesday, according to the Associated Press. Thune, the majority whip, is viewed as next to succeed U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell in senate leadership. Thune's race was called twenty minutes after the polls closed. \"I want to thank Republicans in South Dakota for supporting my Senate candidacy,\" Thune says. \"I look forward to continue putting South Dakota's interests on the national agenda and stopping Biden's radical, left-wing crusade.\" During Trump's attempt to overturn the results of the 2020 election, Thune said the efforts were \"going down like a shot dog.\" Trump lashed out at Thune on Twitter: \"RINO John Thune, 'Mitch's boy', should just let it play out. South Dakota doesn't like weakness. He will be primaried in 2022, political career over!!\" It was speculated that Thune was ready to retire from politics but announced his bid for reelection in January. After sailing to victory in the Republican primary, Thune will face Democrat Brian Bengs in November. The race isn't predicted to be competitive, with Thune as the likely winner.",

Wade. The percentage of Americans who consider themselves \"pro-choice\" has risen in the past year to 55%, its highest level in decades, according to a Gallup poll released Thursday. That increase mainly was driven by Democrats, wrote Lydia Saad, the polling firm's director for U.S. social research, in a summary of the survey's findings. She attributed the shift to the recent Supreme Court draft opinion suggesting a possible end to Roe v. Wade. Gallup surveyed more than 1,000 U.S. adults by telephone over three weeks beginning May 2 \u2014 the day Politico published a draft opinion suggesting that the Supreme Court could soon overturn Roe v. Wade. That decision would enable many states to dramatically restrict or ban abortions. The poll found the highest pro-choice affiliation that Gallup has measured since 1995, when 56% of Americans identified as such. That number had fluctuated between 45% and 50% for the past decade before jumping six points in the latest survey. \"The prospect of the Supreme Court overturning the case that established women's right to seek an abortion has clearly jolted a segment of Americans into identifying with the pro-choice side of the issue and expressing more unequivocal support for abortion being legal,\" Saad wrote. Democrats' pro-choice identification rose from 70% to 88% in the past year. There was no significant change among Republicans, independents, men or older Americans, Gallup said. The survey also found that 52% of Americans consider abortion morally acceptable, the first time a majority has expressed that view since Gallup began asking the question in 2001. A record-low 38% call it morally wrong. Some of the survey's other notable findings: In keeping with AP Style, NPR \u2014 and many other U.S. news outlets\u2014 avoids the terms \"pro-choice\" and \"pro-life\" except when they are part of the name of a group (the Public Editor's office explained this policy in a 2019 column). Gallup specifically asked people whether they considered themselves to be pro-choice or pro-life, explaining in its summary that those are the \"prevailing terms used by the two major sides of the issue\" in the national discussion. Still, it acknowledged that Americans' interpretation of the terms can change in response to major events \u2014 and that this could help account for the recent spike in pro-choice identification. \"In the aftermath of the leaked opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson, being pro-life may be more associated than ever with being against Roe v. Wade,\" Gallup said. \"This could have pushed some former pro-life identifiers who feel ambivalently about abortion but favor Roe v. Wade to now put themselves in the pro-choice camp.\" The survey's findings fit with broader public opinion polling about Americans' views on abortion and Roe. An NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll released mid-May, for example, found that some 64% of Americans opposed overturning Roe (compared to 58% according to Gallup). NPR's survey similarly found that the leaked draft opinion was having a galvanizing effect on Democrats. Two-thirds of Democrats said the contents of the draft opinion made them more likely to vote in the November midterm elections, compared to just 40% of Republicans \u2014 who are favored to regain control of the House and possibly the Senate this year.",

            "article_content": "Biden visited Uvalde as DOJ announced a review of how police responded to the attack. There will be a presidential runoff in Colombia. People with serious mental illness struggled during the pandemic.  RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: The police in Uvalde, Texas, admit that they made mistakes in responding to the mass shooting last week. And now the Department of Justice is investigating. LEILA FADEL, HOST: And for the second time in as many weeks, President Biden tried to comfort a community devastated by a mass shooting. He was in Texas yesterday with the first lady. They met with families of the victims of the attack on Robb Elementary School that left 19 children and two teachers dead. MARTIN: NPR's Pien Huang is in Uvalde and joins us this morning. Pien, there's been so much confusion over exactly what happened on that day, and now the Justice Department is involved. Tell us what's going on. PIEN HUANG, BYLINE: Yeah, there's a lot of anger from the community, a lot of questions over how law enforcement responded to the shooting. You know, at first, Texas Governor Greg Abbott had praised a quick response for saving children's lives. Then the Texas Department of Public Safety later reported that 19 policemen failed to enter the classroom for the better part of an hour. Now the Justice Department says they're launching their own independent probe into the law enforcement response. It's been requested by the mayor of Uvalde, who's been asked to hold law enforcement accountable. DOJ says their goals here are to explain what happened in Uvalde and how law enforcement can avoid these mistakes in the next active shooter situation. There's no clear time frame for the investigation, but they have pledged to make the results public. MARTIN: Meanwhile, this community is getting ready to hold funeral services for the victims, which is very grim work to say the least. HUANG: Mmm hmm. Yeah, absolutely. I mean, next to one of Uvalde's two funeral homes, the florist there is working nonstop to prepare wreaths and arrangements. Kelly Baker is owner of The Flower Patch. KELLY BAKER: Some days are harder than others, especially when you're sitting with families that you've grown up with. It's so hard because they're coming to you to do something very personal for them. HUANG: The other day, Baker sat with a high school classmate who had lost a child in the shooting. BAKER: Their baby's favorite was sunflowers. As we start making these arrangements, we're just going to make sure and save sunflowers for this baby so that, you know, her family gets just a tiny bit of what she wanted or what she would have wanted for her service. HUANG: Services for the victims start today with visitation for 10-year-old Amerie Jo Garza, who had celebrated her birthday earlier this month. And over the next 2 1/2 weeks, the community will put 18 more children and two more teachers to rest. MARTIN: President Biden and the first lady were there yesterday. If you could distill that visit down to an image or two, what would they be? HUANG: Well, the president and first lady spent a full day here in Uvalde yesterday. They placed white flowers at a memorial site at Robb Elementary School, where white crosses bore the names of the dead. At one point, the president wiped away a tear. The Bidens then attended Sunday morning mass, along with 600 parishioners at the Sacred Heart Catholic Church, and those that were there told us he was just there to pray. Outside, a small crowd had gathered in the 93-degree heat. Linda Casas had driven in from San Antonio. LINDA CASAS: I'm not a parent. I have nieces and nephews - 10, 5, 6. And I don't know. It just hit me for some reason. I said - I woke up this morning, and I said, you know what? I got to go. MARTIN: And how was he received? I mean, was it all universally warm? HUANG: Well, some people we spoke with were grateful that the president came to visit and show solidarity and support. But as Biden exited the church, an onlooker did shout, do something, and Biden did say, we will. MARTIN: NPR's Pien Huang in Uvalde, Texas. Thank you. HUANG: Thanks for having me. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MARTIN: Heading now to Colombia, where a former left-wing guerrilla and a populist real estate mogul are headed for a presidential runoff on June 19. FADEL: Now, the pair of anti-establishment candidates were the top vote-getters in the country's presidential election yesterday. It's a rebuttal of the ruling class, which is predominantly conservative. MARTIN: Reporter John Otis joins us from Bogota. Hey, John. JOHN OTIS, BYLINE: How's it going? MARTIN: It goes well. What do we know about these two candidates? OTIS: Well, they're both quite unorthodox. In first place yesterday was Gustavo Petro with 40% of the vote. He's a former left-wing guerrilla who later served in Congress and as the mayor of Bogota, and he's now on his third run for the presidency. And Petro's promised some pretty big changes here. He wants to phase out the production of oil, which is Colombia's biggest export. He wants to raise taxes on the rich to fund anti-poverty programs. And he also plans to reestablish diplomatic relations with the authoritarian regime next door in Venezuela. So all of this has Colombia's business leaders and social elites on edge. MARTIN: He came in first, but he didn't win an outright victory, right? What happened? OTIS: In Colombia, unlike the U.S., you need to win more than half the votes to avoid going to a runoff, and that didn't happen. Rodolfo Hernandez was runner-up with 28% of the vote. And he's a really colorful character. He made his fortune in real estate. He went on to become mayor of the northern city of Bucaramanga. And ideologically, he's just all over the map. He's pro-business, but, for example, he also supports abortion rights and legalizing marijuana. His main claim to fame as mayor was getting caught on video slapping a city councilman in the face in an argument over corruption. MARTIN: Whoa. OTIS: He's 77. And he's also prone to gaffes. On one occasion, he praised Adolf Hitler when he meant to say Albert Einstein. He's skipped candidate debates. He's conducted most of his campaign on TikTok videos. And he even granted a TV interview in his pajamas. MARTIN: OK, so he's a colorful character, but what's the political appeal? What's the appeal of his platform to voters? OTIS: Well, Hernandez appeals to Colombians who are sick of political corruption and business as usual. He plays up this image of himself as this kind of gruff and foul-mouthed anti-corruption crusader. Again, Hernandez made millions in real estate, which in Colombia is an area riddled with corruption. His campaign is self-financed. So he claims that if he wins the presidency, he's not going to owe anybody. But he also faces graft accusations from his time as mayor, and that case is set to go to trial in July. MARTIN: So the next president is either going to be this real estate developer or this former left-wing guerrilla. I mean, these are political outsiders either way, and that's a big deal, right? OTIS: Yeah. You know, in Colombia, the winning candidates have always come from centrist or conservative political parties, and neither of the current candidates - not Gustavo Petro, not Rodolfo Hernandez - fits this bill. But Colombians have become really frustrated by political scandals and rising poverty. COVID-19 drove up poverty from 35 to 42% of the population and triggered that protest last year. So this time around, Colombians really seem ready for something completely different. MARTIN: And it's going to be a tight race in that runoff. John Otis reporting from Bogota. Thank you so much, John. OTIS: Thank you very much. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MARTIN: More than 1 in 20 Americans experienced serious mental illness, and this was before the pandemic. FADEL: For some people struggling with these kinds of health issues, the masking, lockdowns and misinformation made it harder to distinguish reality from delusion. MARTIN: NPR's Yuki Noguchi has been looking into this, and she joins me now. Hey, Yuki. YUKI NOGUCHI, BYLINE: Good morning, Rachel. MARTIN: All right. I think it's probably prudent, before we really start talking, to just define what we mean when we say serious mental illness. NOGUCHI: Yeah, experts say a core part of it involves psychosis, you know, a loss of touch with reality. And this can happen with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depression, which affect about 5% of the population. MARTIN: OK. So how did COVID affect people who have serious mental illness? NOGUCHI: Well, physically, people with schizophrenia are more likely to contract COVID and also to die from it. But as far as mental health, there's not much data. In talking to researchers and doctors, a lot seems to depend on a person's circumstance - you know, whether they had housing, family, jobs or access to health care. Those were already challenging for many people because these illnesses often strike young adults and, therefore, interrupt school, careers or dating. So they already faced high rates of isolation and poverty pre-pandemic. On the other hand, people with serious mental illness also told me that dealing with crisis is just old hat to them. MARTIN: So, I mean, that might be just part of life when you're suffering from serious mental illness. But did they describe how this particular crisis of the pandemic affected them? NOGUCHI: Well, I'll give you an example of a Boston man named Peter (ph). He grew up in Romania in the 1980s under the brutal Ceausescu regime. There was constant government surveillance, so a certain amount of paranoia was a survival skill. But to this day, fear causes epileptic seizures and blackouts for Peter. The pandemic made it hard to know what to believe. PETER: Seeing people wearing masks, I was thinking that they're trying to protect themselves from the invasive cameras that are posted all throughout the city, all throughout the subway. NOGUCHI: Misinformation about COVID and vaccines made reality feel even slipperier. Social media seemed to control political discourse. And all this validated his fears. PETER: If I read the news, which I do every day, I feel like I'm not ill. But then, of course, I read my diagnosis, and it tells me right there that I'm schizophrenic, that I might have paranoid delusions. So I don't know. NOGUCHI: Reality felt delusional sometimes, right? MARTIN: Right, yeah. So what did he do? How did he get through it? NOGUCHI: Well, Peter says crisis is familiar to him. He knows how to handle it. He takes long walks and meditation, and that helps. Benjamin Druss, a public health professor at Emory University, says he hears that kind of thing a lot. BENJAMIN DRUSS: They've proved to be pretty resilient. Many of the coping mechanisms that people have developed they're able to put into good use when an enormous stressor like COVID hits. NOGUCHI: He says, of course, telehealth helped, at least if you have an internet connection. But joblessness, homelessness and social isolation are unfortunately common among people with serious mental illness. That represents a lot of the patients Hannah Brown sees. She's a psychiatry professor at Boston Medical Center and works in the ER. She says patients were more acute and required longer hospital stays, 2 to 3 times longer than pre-pandemic. HANNAH BROWN: It speaks to the severity of the disease worsening over the past two years, like, significantly worsening. NOGUCHI: So, Rachel, you know, how much social support people had was a huge determinant of how they did. MARTIN: Yeah. I can imagine. NPR's Yuki Noguchi. We appreciate your reporting on this.

            "article_content": "The power of former President Trump's endorsement faltered in Georgia's closely watched primaries on Tuesday. His pick for U.S. Senate won, but so too did two of his biggest political foes.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: The power of former President Trump's endorsement was not enough for several candidates in Georgia's primary elections, which ended yesterday. Republican Governor Brian Kemp won renomination, defeating a challenger who denied Trump's defeat in 2020. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BRIAN KEMP: Conservatives across our state didn't listen to the noise. They didn't get distracted. They knew our record of fighting and winning for hardworking Georgians. INSKEEP: Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger also won his primary outright. He had more than 50%, so he doesn't need a runoff. He's well-known for refusing to, quote, \"find\" enough votes to change the outcome of the 2020 election in Trump's favor. Stephen Fowler of Georgia Public Broadcasting has been covering all this. Stephen, welcome back. STEPHEN FOWLER, BYLINE: Good morning. INSKEEP: Anything surprise you about these results? FOWLER: Honestly, the blowout level of Governor Brian Kemp was a surprise. He is one of the most conservative governors in the country. And even in the face of a Trump-backed challenger, he remained popular with voters for things like pay raises for teachers and state employees, championing rural job investments and his stances on social issues like abortion and voting laws. This outcome, Steve, is a huge deal. It continues the trend of incumbent governors surviving Trump challengers. And it shows that endorsements don't always Trump what voters see and experience on the ground. And there's room for liking the former president and having a different opinion about who should implement those policies. INSKEEP: Endorsements don't always trump. You just kind of said that flatly, didn't, like, play the pun or anything. You're just saying a thing there. Now, as far as Brad Raffensperger goes, he also seems to have had a relatively easy time. FOWLER: Right. He did end up finding enough votes for himself this time, winning in virtually every pocket of the state. Now, around midnight, his campaign said the remaining votes that are not yet counted are in areas that favor him and his margin will hold. He faced a candidate who said the 2020 election was fraudulent and raised questions about certifying future elections if Republicans didn't win. And voters took note of that. I called Raffensperger after he declared victory. And he said it was, quote, \"rewarding\" after all the misinformation. BRAD RAFFENSPERGER: So for the last 14, 15 months, I've been traveling all over Georgia. I explain to people what happened in the election of 2020. FOWLER: Another interesting data point to note here is there's a sizable number of people that previously voted in Democratic primaries that pulled Republican ballots this time. Anecdotally, it's a lot of people that wanted to vote for people like Raffensperger and Brian Kemp because they wanted trustworthy elections. INSKEEP: I want to ask about one other result from yesterday. Republicans, as we have reported, are trying for a more diverse voter base in a more and more diverse state. And they nominated a Black candidate for United States Senate. What does that tell you? FOWLER: Well, Herschel Walker's celebrity status in Georgia means he would have blown away the competition even if Trump did not back him. He's a legendary University of Georgia football player with decades of good will and good vibes from many people in the state. Here's part of Walker's victory speech. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) HERSCHEL WALKER: I don't look like a politician. (LAUGHTER) WALKER: I don't talk like a politician. I don't even dress like a politician because my neck is a little bit too big for this tie. (LAUGHTER) WALKER: But I like not being a politician. FOWLER: But coming with the territory of not being a politician is a parade of negative revelations about Walker, ranging from domestic violence allegations to reports of overinflated resume and business backgrounds. But none of it really seemed to stick. Some Republicans are worried, come November, that that'll be a liability in the race against Senator Raphael Warnock. But for now, Republicans are rallying behind Walker. INSKEEP: OK. You mentioned Warnock. He's the Democratic senator seeking a second term. Stacey Abrams is the Democratic nominee for governor who will then face Governor Kemp. What to expect? FOWLER: Well, Georgia's a fierce battleground in recent years. And certainly, that's not going to be any different this time. Democrats face a tough national environment. But the new slate of nominees is looking to capitalize on Republican infighting here. Republicans are fighting the trend of demographics and politics shifting away from them. But the strong showings by Kemp and Walker means unity might be a quicker, easier sell. One thing for sure, the wide margins we've seen in these primary races will not be returning this fall. INSKEEP: Tight race ahead. Stephen, thanks so much. FOWLER: Thank you.

Ivey faced eight challengers in the Republican primary for governor BIRMINGHAM, Ala. - Incumbent Gov. Kay Ivey has won the crowded Republican primary for governor in Alabama, according to The Associated Press. Out of eight total competitors, Ivey's two biggest rivals, Tim James and Lynda Blanchard have never been elected to public office. However, Blanchard was appointed in 2019 by then-President Donald Trump to serve as an Ambassador to Slovenia and James is the son of former Alabama governor, Fob James. James, Blanchard and other challengers attacked Ivey during the campaign for not being conservative enough. Dean Odle, another primary candidate for governor called her, \"a Democrat in Republican clothing.\" But Ivey has a strong conservative record. This year, Ivey signed one of the most restrictive laws around transgender care \u2014 criminalizing gender-affirming treatments for minors. \"I believe very strongly that if the Good Lord made you a boy, you are a boy, and if he made you a girl, you are a girl,\" Ivey said when she signed the legislation. She also signed a law in 2022 to allow Alabamians to be able to carry a concealed gun without a permit. In 2019, she signed the \"Human Life Protection Act,\" which would outlaw abortion in Alabama if the U.S. Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade. And though her messaging waivered at times, she also had made false claims about widespread 2020 election fraud.

And y'all, this is the most important one yet. The Democrats are going to do everything they can try to take back power in this state and we cannot let them reverse the progress we've made in Alabama.\" A former educator, Ivey, who is 77, was sworn in as governor of Alabama after her predecessor resigned in 2017. She was then elected to a full term in 2018 and is seen as having an easy path to victory this November. Her Democratic challenger is unknown at this point \u2014 that primary race heads to a runoff. Alabama hasn't elected a Democrat for governor in nearly a quarter-century.",

            "article_content": "Tuesday is the final day for voters to cast a ballot in the Georgia primaries. The most watched races are for governor, U.S. Senate and secretary of state.  SACHA PFEIFFER, HOST: And now we turn to Georgia, where the state is in its final day of primary voting. Georgia is one of the most consequential political battleground states in the country. And for Republicans, the most consequential race is for governor. Republican incumbent Brian Kemp is facing off against a candidate picked by former President Donald Trump. To tell us more, we have WABE's Sam Gringlas in Atlanta. Hi, Sam. SAM GRINGLAS, BYLINE: Hi, Sacha. PFEIFFER: Sam, let's go right to that gubernatorial race, the GOP primary for governor. The incumbent, Brian Kemp, is trying to fend off former U.S. Senator David Perdue. Why does this primary matter so much? GRINGLAS: Well, people are looking to Georgia for answers about the direction of the Republican Party. You've got a challenger in David Perdue, who Trump urged to run. The former president was furious with Trump for not helping him overturn the 2020 election (ph). And Perdue has taken up that mantle, baselessly insisting that the 2020 election was stolen. Trump has made endorsements in every race from Secretary of State down to insurance commissioner, so this primary may tell us at least a little bit about Trump's hold on the GOP. PFEIFFER: And I gather that it's also going to show how entrenched the false election fraud claims are in the GOP. GRINGLAS: You know, I have met Republican voters of all stripes at apple orchards, margarita stands, golf clubs, you name it. You have got people who deeply believe these election fraud claims. You have voters who think there was fraud but don't blame Kemp. And there are others who just want to move forward. Georgia's Republican Lieutenant Governor Jeff Duncan - he is in that last camp. JEFF DUNCAN: At the beginning of the election cycle, it felt like, you know, Donald Trump was a freight train if he was against you. And now it really kind of feels like a matchbox car. Maybe it hurts your toe a little bit, but it doesn't knock you off your feet. GRINGLAS: Kemp is an incumbent with the record that most conservative politicians would dream of, and despite Trump's opposition, it's looking like he might avoid a runoff with Perdue. PFEIFFER: And, Sam, whoever wins this will advance to go up against Democrat Stacey Abrams. That's the next step, right? GRINGLAS: Yep. If Kemp prevails tonight, that'll set up a rematch of their very tight 2018 campaign. Since then, more than a million new voters have registered in Georgia. But Democrats are also facing really strong political headwinds with inflation, the pandemic. I actually asked Abrams about that this morning, and she told me that demographic forces alone will not be enough to guarantee victory. STACEY ABRAMS: We have new people coming to the rolls, but we also have voters who've been here who, for the first time, believe it matters if they cast their ballot. And my intention is to make certain they have a reason to show up and to vote for their future. GRINGLAS: Abrams would be the first African American woman to be governor in this country. And one thing to watch is how gender and race play into this campaign. Just yesterday, David Perdue said that Abrams, quote, \"demeans her own race.\" Abrams told me that Republicans are focusing on her because they're hiding from their own record. PFEIFFER: Sam, what are you hearing about actual voting, the process itself? GRINGLAS: The secretary of state's office says that Georgia is on its way to record turnout for a midterm primary election, and so far, no widespread problems have we heard about. But this is the biggest election since Georgia passed a sweeping election law in 2021, including new rules for absentee ballots and drop boxes. I chatted with a few voters today, too, and heard about abortion from so many, including Linnea Bavick, a physics grad student. LINNEA BAVICK: It's kind of hard to say, like, I'm happy because of, like, how things are going right now with losing some rights that I, like, never thought we would lose. But I feel like Georgia is changing really fast and, like, people are more engaged politically, I guess. GRINGLAS: Georgia is right in the throes of all of the big debates our democracy is grappling with right now, and that is not going to end tonight. PFEIFFER: WABE'S Sam Gringlas in Atlanta, thank you. GRINGLAS: Thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.  All rights reserved.

(Right) Abortion-rights supporter Rikki Hayes holds up a sign near the site of a Wellspring Health Access clinic. A modest, tan building sandwiched between a gas station and a small apartment house near downtown Casper, Wy., has become an unexpected focal point of America's abortion debate, just weeks before Wyoming could outlaw the procedure. Inside, a nonprofit is renovating the space into a clinic that, beginning in June, would be the only one in Wyoming to provide procedural abortions. The Casper clinic also would become the closest option for people in what the nonprofit's founders describe as an \"abortion desert,\" extending into western Nebraska and South Dakota. Outside, on a recent Thursday, more than 100 abortion opponents gathered for a prayer vigil on the sidewalk along a busy five-lane street. A smaller group of vocal abortion-rights advocates assembled nearby. The protest groups congregate weekly as work to open the clinic continues, despite an imminent U.S. Supreme Court decision expected to reverse constitutional protections for abortion rights provided by the landmark 1973 case Roe v. Wade. A recently passed \"trigger law\" in Wyoming would take effect days after such a ruling, banning most abortions in the state. Teens, young adults, parents with small children, and seniors silently held signs emblazoned with Bible verses or slogans, such as \"Abortion hurts women,\" during the recent vigil. Nearby a group of teens were chanting \"My body, my choice.\" Several drivers passing by honked in support of the anti-abortion group or yelled expletives and, \"It's my body!\" The opposing groups of demonstrators don't see eye to eye on much, but they seemed to agree on one thing: They're surprised the clinic is opening in Wyoming, an overwhelmingly Republican state where 70% of voters supported Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election \u2014 the highest percentage of any state. \"I never thought I would see an abortion clinic come to Wyoming, let alone Casper, just because it is more conservative,\" 39-year-old Robin Holmes said during the vigil. Holmes wore a custom T-shirt and held a homemade poster, both saying \"Unborn Lives Matter.\" She said her daughter became pregnant in her teens but decided against abortion and is now raising the child. Rikki Hayes, who supports the new clinic, found a piece of cardboard on her way to the vigil and held it up after writing \"Mind your own business!\" \"I didn't think in a million years that we, in Casper, would ever get one. We're in Wyoming,\" said Hayes, a 21-year-old coffee shop manager. The future site of the Wellspring Wyoming Health Access clinic is a residential-style building sandwiched between a gas station and a small apartment house near downtown Casper, Wyoming.\n                \n                    \n                    Arielle Zionts/KHN\n                    \n                \nhide caption The future site of the Wellspring Wyoming Health Access clinic is a residential-style building sandwiched between a gas station and a small apartment house near downtown Casper, Wyoming. The idea to open a clinic in Casper came from Wyoming activist Christine Lichtenfels. She shared her suggestion with Julie Burkhart, a Colorado resident and veteran of the national abortion-rights movement The only other Wyoming clinic offering abortions is in Jackson, a five-hour drive west of Casper and near the Idaho border. It offers only medication abortions up to 10 weeks of gestation. \"I just thought, 'Gosh, why can't we get something in Casper?' It's the perfect location, pretty much in the center,\" Lichtenfels said. Burkhart agreed and founded the nonprofit Wellspring Health Access in May 2021 to open the clinic and plan other projects aimed at expanding access to abortion. Lichtenfels is an attorney and board member of Chelsea's Fund, a nonprofit that provides financial assistance for Wyoming residents seeking abortions. She said taking a day or more to travel to an appointment creates logistical and financial burdens for many people. \"You have a job, maybe you've got kids, so you've got to find kid care,\" Lichtenfels said. \"Maybe you don't have a great car, maybe you don't have a car. Or maybe the roads are closed.\" Casper, with a population of about 59,000, is a three- or four-hour drive north or south from the nearest clinics \u2014 one in Billings, Montana, and another in Fort Collins, Colorado. It's also relatively close to regions of neighboring states without abortion services. Some people in western South Dakota seeking abortions now drive five hours to clinics in Montana or Colorado. If they stay within South Dakota, they must travel four hours to Sioux Falls, where they face a three-day waiting period. When organizers began planning the clinic, Wyoming had fewer abortion restrictions than many other Republican-controlled states. Wyoming allows abortion up to viability (about 24 weeks) and has no ban on telemedicine abortions. It has no mandated waiting period, doesn't require doctors to read specific information to patients, and doesn't require patients to view an ultrasound. Still, the state remained largely devoid of abortion services. Then, in March, Wyoming became the 13th state to pass a \"trigger law.\" The law would make abortions illegal five days after Roe v. Wade is overturned, with exceptions in cases of pregnancies involving rape, incest, or risk to the mother's life. Similar laws are on the books in Idaho, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Utah. Policy watchers expect Montana and Nebraska lawmakers also will pursue abortion bans. That means many women and other pregnant people seeking abortion from this region would need to drive or fly to other states for abortion services if Roe v. Wade is overturned. No matter what the U.S. Supreme Court decides, the public debate will continue in Wyoming, both sides say. Burkhart said legal challenges could slow Wyoming's trigger law from taking effect. Even if the state outlaws abortion, she hopes the clinic will stay open to offer its other services, such as gynecology, testing for sexually transmitted infections, family planning, and gender-affirming care for LGBTQ+ patients. She also expects Wellspring Health Access will explore ways to help people in states with abortion bans find services in neighboring states, including opening clinics near state borders or bringing mobile clinics or telemedicine services to those areas. Burkhart said it may also be possible to bring mobile clinics into states with abortion bans, to screen, prep, and enroll people for out-of-state appointments. Local anti-abortion activists say that even if Wyoming bans abortion, their campaign won't end. Bob Brechtel is a Republican former state legislator who helps organize the weekly prayer vigils outside the Casper clinic. \"Rule of law is important, but what's more important is that we do have people who are accepting and understanding of our purpose to defend human life at all stages,\" he said.

And Republican candidates are trying to prove they're aligned with Donald Trump by denying the legitimacy of the 2020 presidential election.  SACHA PFEIFFER, HOST: Alabama has a primary tomorrow. Republican candidates up and down the ballot are trying to prove they're aligned with former President Donald Trump by denying the legitimacy of the 2020 presidential election. It's a full-on embrace of Trump's big lie. NPR's Debbie Elliott reports. DEBBIE ELLIOTT, BYLINE: Watching the ads running up to Alabama's Republican primary, you might think it was still 2020 - like this one from Governor Kay Ivey's reelection campaign... (SOUNDBITE OF POLITICAL AD) KAY IVEY: The fake news, big tech and blue-state liberals stole the election from President Trump. But here in Alabama, we're making sure that never happens. ELLIOTT: ...Or this one from Congressman Mo Brooks, who's running for Senate. It opens with his speech before the January 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. (SOUNDBITE OF POLITICAL AD) MO BROOKS: America does not need any more weakling, cowering, wimpy Republican congressmen and senators. On January 6, I proudly stood with President Trump in the fight against voter fraud. ELLIOTT: Brooks, wearing body armor under his jacket at the time, urged the crowd to, quote, \"start taking down names and kicking ass.\" The congressional committee investigating January 6 has subpoenaed Brooks to testify, after he declined to cooperate. President Trump at first endorsed Brooks in the Senate race but then withdrew his support in March after Brooks fell in polls behind candidates Katie Britt and Mike Durant. The race has since tightened, with Brooks close behind Britt. She's the former chief of staff to longtime Alabama Senator Richard Shelby, who is retiring, opening up this battle for his seat. Durant is a political newcomer. He's a former U.S. Army helicopter pilot and POW in the incident that was the subject of the book and movie \"Black Hawk Down.\" He, too, is an election denier. (SOUNDBITE OF POLITICAL AD) MIKE DURANT: The American people were robbed in 2020. ELLIOTT: For her part, Katie Britt stopped short of calling the 2020 election stolen but advocates for a forensic audit. Governor Kay Ivey, pressed on the matter, doesn't sound as sure as she does in her campaign ad. IVEY: Nothing's ever been proven about that, but it sure seems like there was some monkey business going on. ELLIOTT: Regardless, the message resonates with voters like 80-year-old Wayne King of Brewton. He says he's already cast an absentee ballot for Ivey and, in the Senate race... WAYNE KING: Mo Brooks - he's had a lot of experience. ELLIOTT: King said he's not dissuaded by the fact that Donald Trump pulled his support from Brooks. KING: Well, that's Donald Trump, but he has done a very good job. He just tweets too much, and he's got too much ego. ELLIOTT: King and other conservative voters bring up the notion that Mike Durant was coaxed by liberals to enter the race, though there's no evidence of that. Durant, a government contractor, has lagged in recent polls despite outspending his opponents, fueled mostly with his own money. MELISSA ROBINSON: I don't know about Mike Durant. ELLIOTT: That's Republican voter Melissa Robinson of Evergreen, Ala. She's not necessarily a fan of Mo Brooks, either. She's a Trump supporter but did not approve of the January 6 attack on the Capitol. ROBINSON: I thought, what is this country coming to? ELLIOTT: Robinson says she's leaning toward Britt, in part because of the ads she's seen, where Britt talks about her faith and her opposition to abortion rights. ROBINSON: I think she's a strong, strong Christian. ELLIOTT: Britt, who is 40, most recently worked as head of the Alabama Business Council. She has financial backing from a super PAC affiliated with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, one that's aggressively attacking Mo Brooks. Eighteen-year-old Jake Moore from Clanton, Ala., will be voting for the first time in Tuesday's Republican primary. He's already weary from the political divisiveness he sees coming out of Washington and is looking for a reset. Moore says Katie Britt could help foster that. JAKE MOORE: A balance between bipartisanship and selling out, you know? She's strong, stands by her values, but she's a reasonable person. I think she's got my vote. ELLIOTT: If no one gets a majority of votes, the Republican Senate race would go to a runoff next month. Debbie Elliott, NPR News, Evergreen, Ala. Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "In Georgia's primary, one of the people everyone is talking about isn't on the ballot. Former President Trump has endorsed thirteen candidates there.  MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: But we are going to head now to Georgia, where tomorrow's big primary race feels familiar. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DAVID PERDUE: The election in 2020 was rigged and stolen. KELLY: That is former GOP Senator David Perdue. He spent a lot of his campaign echoing Donald Trump's false claim of election fraud. Perdue is challenging incumbent Governor Brian Kemp, and the winner here will face another familiar name, Stacey Abrams. She is running unopposed for the Democratic nomination, which is not going unnoticed by Republican voters. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: So I really want to hear some things about how he plans to beat Stacey, because Kemp has already beaten Stacey. Perdue lost to Ossoff. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: I have no problem with the job Governor Kemp did, but all my buddies tell me that Mr. Perdue's the man. KELLY: Add to that a contentious race for secretary of State and another contest that could ultimately decide the balance of power in the Senate, and it is no wonder this Georgia primary will be so closely watched. I talked about it with Rahul Bali, politics reporter at WABE in Atlanta, starting with David Perdue. RAHUL BALI, BYLINE: He was pushed into this race by the former president. And Perdue's top issue, like the former president's top issue, was that the 2020 election was stolen, including here in Georgia. And we've said it once, we've said it plenty of times. There have been investigations, lawsuits looking at what happened, and the claims have just not panned out. KELLY: This is false. Yeah. But Perdue is - I mean, he opened more than one of his televised debates repeating that line. BALI: Exactly. There have been three televised debates, and this is how he opened two of them. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PERDUE: The madness we see in the Biden administration started right here in Georgia when Brian Kemp caved to let radical Democrats steal the election. BALI: This is usually the first thing that he brings up, these false claims around the 2020 elections. KELLY: Are voters buying it? What do the polls say? BALI: What it's looking like is that David Perdue has really not expanded that group of voters who believe that. So there was a recent Fox News poll that showed Governor Brian Kemp with a lead of 32%. But let me tell you, here's the number that matters - 50%. In the state of Georgia, you need 50% of the vote to avoid a runoff. And this is what it's all about. David Perdue is trying to get Governor Kemp into a runoff. Governor Kemp is just trying to avoid one. KELLY: If Kemp manages to succeed and avoid that runoff, if he gets his 50%, he would face, as you mentioned, Stacey Abrams in November, which would be quite the rematch from their last race. What would be different this time around? BALI: It's four years later. You know, Governor Kemp has his record of four years as governor, something he's going to point to. Abrams is going to look at that same record, and she's going to attack it. You know, for Georgia Republicans, they're going to try to attach Stacey Abrams to the Biden administration and the issues that are plaguing the administration - for example, inflation. And then you've got to talk about abortion. You know, with the possibility of Roe being overturned, kicking it back to the states - you know, talking to people on the ground, it is going to engage both sides. It's going to engage abortion rights opponents and those who support them. The question is, how many more voters could this bring to the polls? KELLY: Let's move to the Senate race. This is for the seat currently occupied by Democrat Raphael Warnock. He is trying to defend his seat. Where does this race stand? BALI: So it's looking like the Republican choice is going to be Herschel Walker. That's a name that some people may recognize, that may not recognize. He is a former football star. He was the centerpiece of the 1980 University of Georgia national football title team - a big name here. But so is Raphael Warnock. He is the pastor of Ebenezer Baptist Church, the church that was once pastored by Martin Luther King Jr. And these are both Black men fighting for a seat in the Deep South. So this is - it's going to be a really interesting race to watch. You're going to have star power, obviously. You're going to see Donald Trump, who has supported Herschel Walker's race, really pushed Herschel Walker into this race. And you can expect big names to come down to this state for Senator Warnock as well. KELLY: Yeah. One more race I want to throw in the mix, the race for secretary of state. This is the person who oversees elections in Georgia and not a race that usually we would be talking about on a national news program, but here we are. BALI: That's right. You know, that's a race that doesn't really get attention here in Georgia as well. But, you know, the position was thrown into the national spotlight after the election in 2020. You may remember that former President Donald Trump had that phone call with the current Georgia secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger. That call was taped. And in that call, you hear him pressured to find enough votes to win the state of Georgia in 2020. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DONALD TRUMP: I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have, because we won the state. BALI: And obviously, in the end, Raffensperger refused, along with Governor Kemp. And both of them became the target of former President Trump's rage. Raffensperger's running again. He's facing a whole field of candidates who are focusing on the false election claims of 2020. Leading that pack is current Congressman Jody Hice, and that is the heart of his argument, that the elections were given away in 2020 here in Georgia. KELLY: So take me more inside the conversations that you are having with voters. I remember I was in Georgia last year for the runoff. I went to what ended up being Trump's last big outside D.C. rally as president. It was in Dalton in north Georgia. And person after person we spoke to were convinced that he had been robbed. What are you hearing now? BALI: Mary Louise, it's not changed at all. The majority of Republican and conservative voters I talked to across the state believe something went wrong with the 2020 elections. The question simply is, how is that going to affect 2022? And the concern comes from voters like Lee (ph) from Commerce, Ga. He wouldn't give his last name. I spoke to him at Donald Trump's rally in northeast Georgia earlier this year. LEE: I'm afraid if you keep bringing it up, bringing it up, bringing it up, you're going to turn off a segment of our Republican conservative voters. I think that they might not come back and vote, you know, if it just keeps on and on. It was a fraud. It was a fraud. It was a fraud. You know, we need to talk issues. KELLY: May I just say I'm struck listening to you by how much this race in 2022 still seems totally dominated by 2020 and by former President Trump. How large does he loom over these primaries tomorrow in Georgia? BALI: He's a key factor. He's a key conversation point in all of this. You know, Donald Trump has endorsed 13 candidates up and down the ballot, congressional races. That's something we're going to be talking about. We just have to talk about it because it's - he's involved in the two top races on the Republican side, governor and U.S. Senate, along with the secretary of state race we're talking about. Look; that is going to be a big conversation point on Wednesday morning when the results are in. What do these results mean? What is the power of the former president over voters - conservative and Republican voters in Georgia? KELLY: So much suspense still ahead. Rahul Bali, thanks so much. BALI: Thank you.

            "article_content": "We take a look at primary results out of Pennsylvania and North Carolina, and look ahead to next week's races, with a focus on Georgia's primaries.  SCOTT SIMON, HOST: The primary season is upon us. Voters in five states went to the polls on Tuesday - more to come next week. NPR senior editor and correspondent Ron Elving joins us. Ron, thanks so much for being with us. RON ELVING, BYLINE: Good to be with you, Scott. SIMON: And let's begin with Pennsylvania. David McCormick and Dr. Mehmet Oz are tied for the Republican Senate nomination. Dr. Oz, of course, has the Donald Trump endorsement. Talk of a recount - what's the latest? ELVING: The latest word appears to be later - no results until much later - 1.3 million votes cast in this race, Scott, and now only about a thousand votes are separating the two leaders. The counties don't have to report their official numbers until June 8. And so we wait. SIMON: Let's stay with Pennsylvania. The lieutenant governor there, John Fetterman, suffered a stroke last week, was not able to make any appearances in the last few days. By the way, he seems to be fine now. Given all, he handily won the Senate Democratic nomination. ELVING: Yeah, on one level, that is phenomenal to have a stroke, go public with it and then beat the vote total of all the other candidates combined in this multi-candidate race by 17 points and by 2 to 1 over his closest rival. You know, John Fetterman is a phenomenal candidate. But the truth is, there were other promising candidates in this field who just never got traction. And this man has already been lieutenant governor for years. So now Democrats in Pennsylvania, possibly on a broader stage, are going to have to come to grips with why Pennsylvania is like a guy with a beard who campaigns in a hoodie and shorts. And by the way, the Republican candidate for governor in Pennsylvania is also a highly colorful figure and as hardcore a conservative as any statewide Republican I've seen in 40 years in any state - total ban on all abortions, total denial of the result of the 2020 election, and yes, total endorsement from Donald Trump. SIMON: And looking ahead to next week, races in five states - Georgia seems to be potentially the most telling about Donald Trump's political pull. ELVING: Indeed, Trump is looking for a miracle here. And if he got it, that would be huge. But this does not seem to be a miracle happening for the former president. This is the race he has prioritized over all others this year. He never forgave Georgia's sitting governor, Republican Brian Kemp, for refusing to help him overturn the clear and verified results of the 2020 election. But now Trump's chosen horse in this race, David Perdue, has pretty much fallen out of contention and is scarcely campaigning. And now we have reports of Trump even pulling back in the final weekend, conceding this one's a lost cause. SIMON: At this point in the primary season, how do you assess the value of Donald Trump's endorsement? ELVING: On the numbers, it looks pretty good - lots of wins. But most of those were candidates running unopposed or heavily favored to win. Trump did get big wins for the Senate in Ohio and West Virginia earlier this spring, and he may still get one in Pennsylvania, as we've been saying. North Carolina was mostly good for him, although he lost out on freshman Madison Cawthorn, whom he had tried to defend against multiple scandals and problems. Trump was also unable to dislodge the governor in Idaho. He had endorsed the challenge to that governor, and he was also unable to get his favored candidate for the governorship in Nebraska. So overall, more of a mixed bag than a juggernaut. SIMON: Finally, The Washington Post reports that Ginni Thomas, wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, emailed two Arizona legislators asking them to reverse Trump's losses in the state. Does this raise conflict-of-interest questions for Justice Thomas? ELVING: It may, and not for the first time, not even for the first time this year. But look, Virginia Thomas has been a movement conservative and activist back to her early days in Washington in the 1980s when she was lobbying for the Chamber of Commerce against proposals like, say, the Family and Medical Leave Act. So this is all highly consistent with who she's been. In these latest episodes, however, urging state legislators to set aside legitimate voting results - they're not only emails in contradiction of the law in the Constitution. They may be in violation as well. SIMON: NPR's senior editor and correspondent Ron Elving, thanks so much. ELVING: Thank you, Scott. Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "Former President Trump is playing a big role on the Republican side \u2014 in states like Pennsylvania and North Carolina \u2014 endorsing Republican candidates who pledged loyalty to him.  EMILY FENG, HOST: Midterm elections are nearly half a year away, but the primary contest to determine who will run for the House and Senate seats this fall - those have already started. Former President Trump is playing a big role by endorsing Republican candidates who pledge loyalty to him. Some of those candidates had their primaries Tuesday, and more elections next week will test the power of a Trump endorsement. Joining us now is NPR senior political editor and correspondent Domenico Montanaro. Hello, Domenico. DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Hey there. Good to join you. FENG: So catch us up on what's happened this week so far in Pennsylvania, where Trump-endorsed candidate Dr. Oz took on former hedge fund CEO David McCormick. MONTANARO: Yeah, that's right. You know, and Mehmet Oz is only narrowly ahead at this hour by 1,100 votes out of more than 1.3 million. We aren't likely to know the winner for days, if not weeks because the margin is just so small. It's well within the 0.5 percentage points that would trigger an automatic recount. And that's bad news for Republicans because it means a delay to the general election in a key Senate race Democrats are targeting as a pickup opportunity after what's really been a bruising Republican primary. The Democratic nominee is Lieutenant Governor John Fetterman, who dons a chin beard and tattoos. He had a stroke in the past several days and had a pacemaker installed on Election Day. He looks the part of a blue-collar trucker more than someone with a Harvard degree and the politics of Bernie Sanders, but that's true, too. This is really going to be a big test for him, for Democrats and, when we finally get to a general election, of whether a Democrat with his kind of image and tone can appeal to that populous Venn diagram of the left and some on the right. FENG: So much drama. President Trump - how have his endorsements fared so far? MONTANARO: They've had some mixed success. You know, this week, Oz, of course, locked in that tight race. Trump got a win in the Pennsylvania governor's race, giving a major boost to State Senator Doug Mastriano. Mastriano's pretty controversial and hard right. He was at Trump's January 6 rally, marched to the Capitol, though he says he left before the violent insurrection took place. And he's an election denier and culture warrior in a purple state saying, if elected, he's going to focus on Day 1 on things like how kids are taught about racism in schools and which bathrooms people can use. In North Carolina this week, Trump was largely responsible for Congressman Ted Budd winning the GOP nomination for the Senate race, though he had less success with the controversial Congressman Madison Cawthorn, who lost his bid for reelection. Out West in the Idaho governor's race, his preferred candidate, who had the backing of some extremists in the state, you know, took on a sitting Republican governor and really was trounced. But even, you know, the explicit - even though the explicit record of endorsements was mixed, the winner, you could really argue, is MAGA. You know, virtually every Republican who's run has tried to be MAGA and vie for Trump's support - not everyone, but most. And, you know, Trump has truly taken over the party's heart and soul. There is just no majority against Trumpism. The minority really is those right now opposed to it. FENG: Well, there are more of Trump's candidates who are being tested next Tuesday. Which races are you watching closely? MONTANARO: So much of the action really is in Georgia. You know, Trump recruited and endorsed David Perdue, the former senator, to take on incumbent Governor Brian Kemp because Trump was upset that Kemp didn't do more to overturn the results of the presidential election in the state that he lost. But right now, it looks like Kemp is winning by a lot in the polls, despite Perdue making the entire election essentially pushing Trump's lie. Perdue is running hardly any ads now, and Trumpworld (ph) behind the scenes has really abandoned Perdue. It really is shocking to watch, frankly. For someone who was the CEO of Reebok, in David Perdue, and was considered a business-establishment Republican, for him to take this turn really surprising to a lot of people who've watched his career. Then, of course, there's the secretary of state's race there. There's no greater target for Trump than Brad Raffensperger, the incumbent secretary of state, the Republican who also refused to bow to Trump's pressure on the election. And also watching Texas, where there's a key Democratic primary between Democrat - the Democrat in Congress, Henry Cuellar, against progressive Jessica Cisneros. Cuellar's the only Democrat in Congress who considers himself against abortion rights, quite the shift in the Democratic Party, which used to have more people who consider themselves against abortion rights. And abortion we're seeing become a huge issue in this election. FENG: Thank you. That's NPR's Domenico Montanaro. MONTANARO: You're welcome. Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "Two-thirds of Americans oppose reversing abortion rights in a new poll. The accused Buffalo shooter appears in court Thursday. And Turkey opposes Finnish and Swedish bids to join NATO.  RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: The unprecedented leak of a draft Supreme Court opinion has thrown abortion rights back in the spotlight of American politics. LEILA FADEL, HOST: The document signaled the court's conservative majority is ready to roll back five decades of what has been a bedrock of American law. Now the latest NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll finds that about two-thirds of Americans oppose overturning the landmark Supreme Court decision that made abortion legal in the United States. MARTIN: With us now to discuss the survey's findings, NPR senior political editor and correspondent Domenico Montanaro. Domenico, thanks for being here. DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Hi, Rachel. MARTIN: So a majority of Americans want to keep Roe in place, huh? MONTANARO: Well, yeah. As you guys noted, roughly two-thirds, 64% of Americans, say they do not support overturning Roe v. Wade. But 68% are in favor of some degree of restrictions on abortion rights. That includes a slim majority of Democrats. Which restrictions, though, draw some differences of opinion. About 6-in-10 think abortion should be allowed at least in the first three months of pregnancy. Others believe it only should be legal in cases of rape, incest or if the life of the pregnant person is at stake. But only 9% think it shouldn't be allowed under any circumstance. When we looked at some of what's being considered in the States, we found that people are largely in favor of providing safe havens for those seeking abortions from out of state. People don't want to let private citizens sue abortion providers. And it's very unpopular to make abortion a crime. Respondents are split, though, when it comes to a 15-week ban and the mailing of abortion-inducing pills. MARTIN: What does this survey say about how this leak out of the court could affect midterm elections? I mean, does either party come away with any kind of advantage? MONTANARO: They do. Democrats are seeing a bit of an advantage. We should note, though, that the draft decision could differ from how the court ultimately rules. MARTIN: Right. MONTANARO: For now, Democrats have the edge not just because most people want - don't want Roe overturned, but also because when it comes to the contents of the leak, 66% of Democrats say it makes them more likely to vote. Compare that to just 40% of Republicans who said so. Lee Miringoff, the director of the Marist Institute for Public Opinion, which conducted the poll, thinks that's a big deal. LEE MIRINGOFF: It definitely has some focus as no other issue in the recent months has. And to have a gap of that magnitude over the Republicans is something that, you know, at this point, should not go unnoticed. MONTANARO: Also, we saw a reversal from last month on who people said they would choose to vote for if the election were held today. Forty-seven percent said they'd choose a Democrat, 42% said a Republican. That's a net eight-point boost for Democrats from last month. Of course, this is nationally, not in the battleground districts, where Democrats acknowledge Republicans have the advantage right now. MARTIN: So then you have to ask, will Democratic voters stay animated? I mean, it's one thing to be really exercised about this in the moment. But does that animation carry over into November? MONTANARO: Yeah, it's a key question. President Biden got a bounce after his State of the Union address, but that receded. I asked Miringoff if he sees anything in this that could make this more long lasting or not. MIRINGOFF: My sense of it is that this is not going to be one of those issues that shows up and vanishes soon thereafter because so many of the states are going to then have a key decision-making role in what the policy is within their jurisdiction. MONTANARO: Now, what we know for sure is that abortion is a potentially huge wild card in this election. We'll see what the Supreme Court actually decides. But right now, the leak is, at least in the short run, firing up Democrats. MARTIN: NPR's Domenico Montanaro. Domenico, thank you. MONTANARO: Hey, you're welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MARTIN: The 18-year-old white man accused of killing 10 people and wounding three others in a shooting rampage appears in court this morning in Buffalo, N.Y. FADEL: The attack took place at a supermarket in a predominantly Black neighborhood. Most of the victims were Black. The state's governor is promising changes to combat what she calls domestic terrorism. MARTIN: NPR's Cheryl Corley has been reporting on this story. She joins us now from Buffalo. Good morning, Cheryl. CHERYL CORLEY, BYLINE: Good morning. MARTIN: Let's start with the suspect. He pleaded not guilty in a quick arraignment last week. What can we expect from today's hearing? CORLEY: Well, today is what's called a felony hearing. And that's where they determine whether there's enough evidence for trial. Payton Gendron, as you mentioned, is charged with first-degree murder. And, like, this is an open-and-shut case - but it's not that simple, according to District Attorney John Flynn. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JOHN FLYNN: Emotions are high. I understand the rawness of this matter. However, I do not operate in the court of public opinion. I operate in a court of law. And this defendant is innocent until proven guilty. CORLEY: And Flynn says more charges may come, however, after a grand jury convenes and investigates the shooting. There's a 45-day window for that to occur. And the clock starts ticking today. MARTIN: I mean, we heard Flynn say the defendant is innocent until proven guilty. We just have to note, though, the shooting at the supermarket was livestreamed on a social media channel before getting removed. And the suspect, apparently, wrote a racist document that was posted online. I mean, are those things going to be factors in the trial? CORLEY: Well, you know, it really depends on whether they are admitted in court. And the battle over evidence always plays out in trials. County board association selected attorneys in private practice to represent the suspect. And what evidence is allowed is sure to be an argument between the defense and prosecutors if the plea remains the same and if the case moves forward. MARTIN: So let's talk about what the governor of New York is doing. Kathy Hochul has moved, along with the state attorney general, to go after social media companies. Tell us more. CORLEY: Well, the governor said the nation's biggest threat is the mainstreaming of hate speech and white supremacy and easy access to military-style weapons and ammunition. She sent a referral letter requesting the attorney general, Letitia James, to investigate social media platforms, Twitch and 4Chan and others that were, apparently, used to amplify the attack. And Hochul also signed an executive order that sets up a domestic terrorism unit. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KATHY HOCHUL: They'll develop the best practices for law enforcement, for mental health professionals, for school officials to address the rise in homegrown extremism. And we'll make sure that they're trained to know how it occurs, where it occurs and how to stop it. MARTIN: So in addition to this focus on social media, the governor has also announced this plan for tighter gun controls. What can you tell us? CORLEY: She wants state lawmakers, really, to close gun law loopholes that she says allows specialty guns to be sold without permits and just a whole package. And in the midst of all this, the community is mourning. There have been vigils held all week. And tomorrow, a funeral will be held for 67-year-old Heyward Patterson, one of the 10 victims. MARTIN: NPR's Cheryl Corley reporting from Buffalo. Cheryl, thank you. CORLEY: You're welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MARTIN: OK. So Finland and Sweden, historically neutral countries, have made this very historic decision to apply for NATO membership. But Turkey says, not so fast. FADEL: Now, Turkey is already a NATO member. And President Recep Tayyip Erdogan wants to keep the two Nordic countries out of the military alliance. All 30 NATO allies have to approve a new member. Meanwhile, the leaders of Finland and Sweden meet with President Biden today. MARTIN: NPR's Peter Kenyon is in Istanbul and joins us. Hey, Peter. PETER KENYON, BYLINE: Hi, Rachel. MARTIN: So Russia's war in Ukraine has put Finland and Sweden noticeably on edge. They want into NATO. Why is Turkey blocking them? KENYON: Well, it's basically Mr. Erdogan - President Erdogan is accusing both countries of sheltering terrorists, harboring terrorism. Now, he's talking about the PKK, Kurdistan Workers' Party. These are Kurdish separatists Turkey's been fighting for decades. The PKK has been designated a terror organization by Turkey, the U.S. and the EU. Yesterday, Erdogan addressed Sweden in a speech to Turkish lawmakers. He said, quote, \"you won't hand over terrorists, but you want to join NATO. How can we say yes to a security organization that is devoid of security?\" as he put it. So that's the general basis of his opposition. MARTIN: Just explain how significant it is that Sweden and Finland have moved to join NATO. KENYON: Well, on one level, it's pretty much formalizing an arrangement that's already been in place on the ground. Both countries have closely cooperated with NATO for years. But as you mentioned, this is happening in the context of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, a move that has rocked Europe and that has forced this historic move by Sweden and Finland - I mean, giving up neutrality policies they've held since the early 19th century primarily out of concern that Putin won't stop with Ukraine. For its part, Moscow is saying it's got no problem with either Scandinavian country. And, really, this has nothing to do with Turkey. But Erdogan appears to see an opportunity to gain concessions before he's willing to approve their accession to NATO. And this is happening, of course, against the backdrop of Turkey's failed attempts to join the European Union. Both Sweden and Finland have backed Turkey's bid, another reason Ankara might be supporting them to get into NATO. Although, those two countries' support isn't enough to overcome objections by France and Germany. MARTIN: I mean, so what does this Turkish opposition mean in practice? Like, do they - could they actually thwart Finland and Sweden's plans here? KENYON: It seems very unlikely at the moment. I say that because almost all the Turkish officials involved say they want to approve their accession into NATO. But first, they want these security concerns addressed. So the question is, will they or won't they? On its face, there shouldn't be any huge change. Even Erdogan, who's taken the hardest rhetorical line, says he would be happy to see them in there if their concerns are met. And presumably, if Turkey did veto the membership, both Finland and Sweden would continue to cooperate. But that would certainly not reflect well on Turkey. And some speculate that it could push Ankara closer to Moscow. MARTIN: How does the relationship between the U.S. and Turkey play into this? KENYON: Well, it's no secret Erdogan's ties with former President Donald Trump were considerably closer than his ties with President Biden. The big thorn in the relationship is Turkey's purchase of S-400 missiles from Russia. It's refusing to give them up even after getting kicked out of the F-35 fighter jet program. At the moment, Ankara's fallback position is F-16 fighter jets. And that remains stuck in Congress. On the other hand, Turkey remains a crucial frontline NATO ally, strategically located in a tough neighborhood between Syria and Iran, controls crucial strategic waterways. So there are certainly reasons on both sides to preserve the relationship. MARTIN: NPR's Peter Kenyon reporting from Istanbul. Peter, we appreciate you. Thanks. KENYON: Thanks, Rachel.

            "article_content": "Five states hold primaries Tuesday, with Senate races in Pennsylvania and North Carolina getting top billing.  MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: Five states held primaries today with notable races for governor and the U.S. House, but top billing has to go to open U.S. Senate contests in North Carolina and Pennsylvania. In North Carolina, the matchup is now set, with Republican Ted Budd set to face Democrat Cheri Beasley in November. And the Associated Press has just called the Pennsylvania Democratic Senate primary for John Fetterman. NPR national political correspondent Don Gonyea is in Pennsylvania. He's here now for an update. Hey there. DON GONYEA, BYLINE: Hey, good evening. KELLY: Hey. So start where you are on this fine evening in Pennsylvania. This is an open Senate seat. It would be a big pickup for Democrats. Tell me more. GONYEA: Well, let's start with Fetterman. No surprise that John Fetterman will be the party's nominee. He had a solid and persistent polling lead the whole campaign, all primary campaign. Fetterman, though, had a plot twist this week. He's been battling some health issues. Today, he announced he's getting a pacemaker put in after revealing over the weekend that he suffered a stroke - a minor stroke, but a stroke nonetheless - last Friday. So right at the end of the campaign, he's knocked off the trail. He says he'll be fine and has suffered no cognitive issues. KELLY: Well that is good news. Beyond the health issues, who is he as a candidate? GONYEA: He's the sitting lieutenant governor of the state. He backed Bernie Sanders in 2020, so he's a progressive. The first thing you notice about him - he's 6 foot 9. He has a shaved head, a chin beard, and he campaigns in basketball shorts and Carhartt gear, a hooded sweatshirt. So he has this persona of an anti-politician. And, you know, even though he backed Sanders, he campaigned in heavily Trump areas as well over the past couple of months. He defeats Congressman Conor Lamb, a moderate Democrat who is seen as a rising star but who never really got any traction. And ultimately, most of the action and attention has been on the Republican side in Pennsylvania. KELLY: Right, where we are suddenly looking, I gather, at a three-way race. GONYEA: Absolutely. It was initially a battle between two very wealthy candidates - celebrity Dr. Mehmet Oz, Dr. Oz, and former hedge fund CEO Dave McCormick. But recently, a third candidate has surged in the polls and is right in there in the mix. She is Kathy Barnette, a conservative commentator, largely unknown. Now she has the glare of the spotlight. Some days it's gone well, some days it's gone maybe not so well. Other candidates are attacking her, mining her Twitter feed, finding things that they hope will be embarrassing and will sway voters. She says the knives are out. But here's the thing - Barnette is a huge Trump supporter. She says Trump was wrong not to endorse her. He endorsed Oz. She told an audience in Scranton last night that conservatives don't need to settle for the likes of Oz or McCormick. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KATHY BARNETTE: And I have worked very hard to make sure that you don't have to hold your nose this time and vote for the lesser of two evil. I am your best chance at ever getting anyone in office who will actually fight for you. GONYEA: And, you know, with abortion so much in the news because of that leaked Supreme Court draft, she has talked openly about her life. And her mother became pregnant with her when she was 11 years old, a rape victim, and had a child who was Kathy - now Kathy Barnette running for Senate. And that's really caught on with a lot of Republican voters. KELLY: Wow, OK. What about the other two who were expected to be the neck-and-neck frontrunners, Oz and McCormick? GONYEA: Oz has the endorsement of Trump. He's leaned heavily into that. His poll numbers went up a bit when Trump endorsed him, but they didn't spike like Trump endorsees in other places have enjoyed. And Trump has been, you know, calling into tele-town halls on Oz's behalf, but Oz is fighting the perception that he's not a true conservative. And Dave McCormick is kind of the establishment figure in the race. But again, there are enough of those that he's been hanging in there as well. KELLY: All right. And meanwhile, over in North Carolina, we've got the results - as expected, as we mentioned, Ted Budd and Cheri Beasley, who are going to face off. That is NPR's Don Gonyea bringing us the latest on the primaries. Thanks so much, Don. GONYEA: My pleasure. Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.  All rights reserved.

He is pictured here speaking at a campaign rally at The Fuge on May 14, 2022 in Warminster, Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania state Sen. Doug Mastriano has emerged as the winner from a crowded Republican primary for governor, according to a race call from The Associated Press. A retired Army colonel, Mastriano has risen to prominence espousing far-right views directly to a homegrown network of online supporters. He's also known for his support of a lie that widespread election fraud led to former President Donald Trump's loss in 2020. For that, Mastriano received Trump's endorsement. The lawmaker from south-central Pennsylvania campaigned using a mix of stand-by Republican positions like lowering taxes and publicly funding private schools, as well as more extreme stances on issues like abortion. Mastriano supports banning the procedure after six weeks and introduced a bill to that effect in the state Senate. He will face Democratic Attorney General Josh Shapiro in the fall. Videos sourced by online sleuths months after Jan. 6, 2021, showed the state senator marching alongside protestors past an abandoned police barricade near the U.S. Capitol. Mastriano released a statement shortly after the videos were released affirming his attendance at the rally for Trump and subsequent march to the U.S. Capitol that day, but insists he followed the law in doing so. Mastriano is among the sitting lawmakers who have been subpoenaed by a U.S. House committee that is investigating the U.S. Capitol attack. The lead that Mastriano commanded late in the race panicked Pennsylvania's Republican party establishment, some of whom threw their support behind his nearest opponent: former U.S. Rep. Lou Barletta. Many hinted they believe Mastriano's views would not be palatable to voters in competitive areas, like southeastern Pennsylvania. At a rally over the weekend that press were barred from entering, Mastriano joked with supporters that \"the Swamp is slapping us around,\" and called those establishment figures \"stupid.\" Political observers have said Mastriano would likely have to moderate his positions in order to be successful statewide. Some, like state Republican party member Jezree Friend, point to President Trump's narrow statewide win in 2016 \u2013 and slightly larger loss in 2020 \u2013 as proof. Friend adds that Mastriano could have a shot at winning the governor's mansion, as long as he keeps both his base and first-time voters engaged through what is likely to be a bruising summer and fall campaign. Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro speaks with people as he awaits a speech from President Biden at Mack Truck Lehigh Valley Operations on July 28, 2021, in Macungie, Pa. Shapiro is the presumptive Democratic nominee for Pennsylvania governor.\n                \n                    \n                    Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro speaks with people as he awaits a speech from President Biden at Mack Truck Lehigh Valley Operations on July 28, 2021, in Macungie, Pa. Shapiro is the presumptive Democratic nominee for Pennsylvania governor. \"If they have this groundswell \u2013 kind of like what Trump was able to do \u2013 and they're able to replicate it to a degree, does that overcome any of those that Mastriano gives a sour taste in their mouth for whatever reason?\" Friend says. On the Democratic side, Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro has won his party's nomination in an uncontested race. Shaprio, who handily won reelection to his post in 2020, has suggested for weeks that he prefers to face Mastriano in the coming months. In an attempt at reverse psychology, his campaign even paid for an anti-Mastriano ad in the days leading up to the primary that condemned the Republican's opposition to no-excuse mail-in voting and support for a so-called \"audit\" of past election results. Mastriano has so far dismissed any threat Shapiro might pose to his bid, and political observers like Friend say the Republican lawmaker may use Shapiro's record in Gov. Wolf's administration against him. Mastriano and other Republicans have tried to turn Wolf into a pariah for issuing emergency orders during the COVID-19 pandemic aimed at protecting public health and reducing hospital admissions. \"Even with his [nearly $18 million] war chest, [Shapiro] is still going to have the very difficult position of distancing himself from Wolf, which is going to be almost impossible,\" Friend says. Pennsylvania's General Election is Nov. 8.",

She is pictured here speaking to supporters before the results of Oregon's primary election were announced in Portland, Ore., Tuesday May 17, 2022. Voters aren't thrilled with the state of affairs in Oregon, but that wasn't enough for Democrats to reject a longtime party leader on Tuesday. Former speaker of the state House Tina Kotek has prevailed over Treasurer Tobias Read in the Oregon Democratic primary for governor, according to a race call from The Associated Press. If she prevails in November, Kotek will become the first openly lesbian governor elected in the nation. Kotek's win indicates her long history of championing progressive policies \u2013 and the many institutional allies she made in the process \u2013 were enough to sway liberal primary voters amid some serious headwinds. Polling has repeatedly shown many Oregon voters are alarmed by rising homelessness, gun violence, and other societal woes, and Read attempted to run a centrist campaign that blamed Kotek for presiding over a state in decline. Kotek successfully sold voters on her deep knowledge of the state government's inner workings, along with her track record passing bills that, among other things, raised the minimum wage, enacted new gun controls, regulated carbon emissions and protected abortion. As of 12:50 a.m. ET on Wednesday, there was still no race call on the GOP side. Leading the field is former state Rep. Christine Drazan, who made a name for herself as the House Republican leader by directing her members to leave the state in order to block climate change legislation in 2020. Polling suggests Drazan is in a tight race with Bob Tiernan, a businessman who served as a state lawmaker in the '90s, but has roared back from political hibernation with the help of more than $700,000 of his own money, big checks from business allies and a relentless tough-on-crime message. Also running is Bud Pierce, an oncologist who served as the party's gubernatorial nominee in 2016; Stan Pulliam, the mayor of Sandy, Ore., who more than any other candidate has embraced the style and rhetoric of former President Donald Trump; Baker City Mayor Kerry McQuisten; and Marc Thielman, a former small-town schools superintendent. Republican candidates have spent most of their campaigns railing against the leadership of Democratic Gov. Kate Brown \u2014 who polls have suggested is the least popular governor in the nation \u2014 on issues like Oregon's strict COVID-19 restrictions, homelessness and crime. Waiting to challenge the winners of the partisan primaries is Betsy Johnson, a former longtime Democratic state senator who left the party last year to mount a gubernatorial run unaffiliated with either party. Because of her independent status, Johnson is not on the ballot Tuesday. Rather, she will attempt to collect roughly 23,750 signatures from voters to land on the November ballot. Political observers expect her to succeed, and to be a formidable presence. Johnson's long history as a business-friendly Democrat has made her a fundraising juggernaut in a state with no limits on campaign giving. Johnson has far outraised all other candidates in the field, with donations that include $1.75 million from Nike co-founder Phil Knight. She's reported raising more than $8 million all told, a staggering sum roughly six months before Election Day. Johnson is selling herself to voters as a better alternative to the extremes of both parties. \"Having to choose between another left-wing liberal promising more of the same or a right-wing Trump apologist \u2014 is no choice at all,\" Johnson said in announcing her campaign last year. \"Oregonians deserve better than the excesses and nonsense of the extreme left and radical right.\" Members of both major parties largely discount the chance that Johnson can win in a deeply partisan environment, but they're at odds about whether she will attract more votes from their party or the other.",

Alexandra Hunt is hoping to unseat establishment Democrat Rep. Dwight Evans for Pennsylvania's 3rd Congressional District during Tuesday's primary. In a lot of ways, Hunt is a traditional progressive candidate. She's well-educated and has a background working in public health. She's also running on the main pillars of the progressive platform \u2014 like the Green New Deal and Medicare for All. In other ways, she's a bit unusual for someone running for Congress. She's spoken publicly about her brief time as a stripper in college to make ends meet. And most recently, she fired up an OnlyFans, a site where some people make money off of posting naked pictures. According to the Daily Mail, the account itself just features posts about Hunt's campaign. At times, Hunt's unexpected background has grabbed negative publicity. She said sexist coverage by the New York Post and Fox News has unfairly spotlighted her history as a stripper. It's coverage that she feels has overshadowed her other qualifications. \"My name has been erased and I'm 'The Former Stripper,'\" she said. In a conversation with NPR, Hunt said she's worked in public health for years and is so much more than her past. Jennifer Lawless, politics professor at the University of Virginia, said Hunt's campaign represents how far American society and politics has gone. \"Ten years ago or 20 years ago she couldn't have even run\" because of societal beliefs and pressure, Lawless said. She added: \"It's progress in and of itself that somebody with that background feels confident and qualified to run for office. I think that demonstrates some degree of progress.\" Congressman Dwight Evans speaks in New York City on September 19, 2017.\n                \n                    \n                    Bryan Bedder/Getty Images for Concordia Summit\n                    \n                \nhide caption Congressman Dwight Evans speaks in New York City on September 19, 2017. Starting the OnlyFans account was an attempt to hit back at an online troll who said they were looking forward to when Hunt loses and she starts an OnlyFans, she said. \"So I made an OnlyFans to push back on that troll, but also to push back on the stigma that this is a thing to be ashamed of, this would disqualify me as a candidate or as a politician,\" she said. \"Because it's not and it shouldn't.\" She said the account is a way to make money and shows what many people of her generation (millennials) must do to make ends meet. \"Alexandra's OnlyFans is her personal account and she does talk about the campaign as it is a part of her life. She shares her opinions, views, campaign updates, thoughts, memes or other things,\" Hunt's campaign said in an email. \"She has shared photos and videos of herself as well. She has sent out Pay Per View content as well which has raised a significant amount for her.\" Alexandra Hunt is hoping to unseat Democratic establishment pick Dwight Evans to represent Pennsylvania's 3rd Congressional District.\n                \n                    \n                    Eric Miller/Alexandra Hunt for Congress campaign\n                    \n                \nhide caption Alexandra Hunt is hoping to unseat Democratic establishment pick Dwight Evans to represent Pennsylvania's 3rd Congressional District. Lawless notes Hunt has smartly used this as a way to connect to young voters struggling to make money. But she added: \"The risk though ... is that when you tell that story, there are going to be people who frame that story differently.\" And Hunt has certainly experienced that. The New York Post wrote: \"Good luck pulling this one off. An ex-stripper from New York left behind her platform shoes for a political platform.\" Hunt has faced increased vitriol as the primary neared. She's spoken publicly about having an abortion. That admission, she believes, has prompted cyber attacks on their campaign site and email system. The attacks have crippled their email access, she said. \"It's almost paralyzed our ability to send emails and fundraise,\" she said. Lawless said the focus and criticism on Hunt's background is, unfortunately, to be expected for any candidate, Lawless said. That goes for male and female candidates. \"Once you're running for public office, every choice you made is something on which you'll be judged,\" she said. Through her research, Lawless has found that in previous congressional races over time, there really isn't much in the way of explicitly sexist coverage, generally. \"When there is gendered coverage, and by that, I mean attention to women's appearances, or women's roles \u2014 and this would certainly fall into that category \u2014 women and men overall, are equally likely to receive that kind of coverage.\" In Hunt's case, the extent her background will actually deter local voters, is probably minimal, Lawless said. The U.S. Capitol building is seen before sunrise on Capitol Hill in Washington.\n                \n                    \n                    Gemunu Amarasinghe/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption The U.S. Capitol building is seen before sunrise on Capitol Hill in Washington. \"The media have an incentive to cover what's novel, because what's novel is newsworthy, and this is unusual,\" Lawless said of Hunt's history. But that attention goes a long way in helping candidates rise above the noise, get their names out, and raise money. Hunt has tried her best to lean into the trolling and criticism.

May's busy primary calendar continues Tuesday, with five states holding elections. Primaries for open U.S. Senate seats in Pennsylvania and North Carolina headline Tuesday's races. Both battleground states present Democrats with opportunities to pick up a Senate seat as they try to maintain narrow control of the chamber. Idaho, Oregon and Kentucky also have notable contests. Here are 10 races to watch: Thanks to the retirement of Republican Pat Toomey, Pennsylvania has an open Senate seat for the first time in a dozen years. And this race has had more than its share of plot twists \u2014 including two Donald Trump endorsements over the past nine months. On the Republican side, after Trump's first preferred choice dropped out amid domestic abuse allegations, two new, high-profile candidates entered the primary: Celebrity doctor Mehmet Oz and former hedge fund CEO David McCormick, who had served in the George W. Bush administration and who's married to a former top adviser to Trump. McCormick and Oz worked hard to win Trump's endorsement. Oz won out, giving his campaign a boost, but that didn't stop McCormick from running ads featuring Trump praising the candidate. For months, polling has had the two jockeying for the top spot in the race, with Oz holding a very small lead since getting the nod from Trump. But now, in the final weeks of the race, another candidate has surged into the top tier. Kathy Barnette \u2014 a Black GOP activist and author best known for her appearances as a commentator on Fox News \u2014 has done it by proclaiming to be more MAGA than even Trump, and despite having just a fraction of the money to spend that the very wealthy McCormick and Oz have. Her rise has surprised political analysts, who suggest she may be benefitting from conservative discontent with Trump's choice of Dr. Oz. Pennsylvania Lt. Gov. John Fetterman is running for the Democratic nomination for U.S. Senate.\n                \n                    \n                    Marc Levy/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption For Democrats, the primary features a matchup between Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, a former small-town mayor who backed Bernie Sanders' 2020 presidential run, and Rep. Conor Lamb. The 6-foot-9 Fetterman has the persona of an authentic anti-politician, while Lamb has a reputation as a moderate who can win votes in places where Democrats have struggled in recent elections. Also in the race is state Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta, who is looking to become the first ever LGBTQ candidate elected to statewide office in Pennsylvania. Despite expectations of a close contest, polls have consistently given Fetterman a lead of more than 20 points, with Lamb a distant second and Kenyatta even further back. (Fetterman suffered a stroke in recent days but said it wouldn't derail his campaign.) Check out WESA Pittsburgh's guide for voters. Rep. Ted Budd is the Republican front-runner for North Carolina's open Senate seat, while Cheri Beasley is the likely Democratic nominee.\n                \n                    \n                    Chris Seward/AP; Gerry Broome/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption This Senate seat is open thanks to another GOP retirement: Sen. Richard Burr, who announced in 2016 he would not seek another term. Trump's daughter-in-law Lara Trump briefly considered a Senate run in her native state, but decided not to pursue it. Nevertheless, the former president weighed in early, backing Rep. Ted Budd last June. Helped by outside money, Budd has emerged ahead of Pat McCrory, a former North Carolina governor who gained national prominence when he signed the state's \"bathroom bill\" which targeted trans people and required people to choose bathrooms based on the sex listed on their birth certificate. Whoever wins on the GOP side will likely face Cheri Beasley, who was the first Black woman to serve as chief justice of the North Carolina Supreme Court. Here's what you need to know for North Carolina's primary from WFAE Charlotte. Just days before the primary, Trump endorsed Pennsylvania state Sen. Doug Mastriano to be governor. Mastriano has peddled Trump's election lies, and was present near the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. (He says he left as the event became violent.) Republicans have been fractured, with many concerned that Mastriano can't win statewide in November. Some other candidates in what started as a crowded field dropped out and have endorsed former Rep. Lou Barletta, but Mastriano's lead in polls and Trump's endorsement place him as the likely winner Tuesday night. Meanwhile, the presumptive Democratic nominee is state Attorney General Josh Shapiro, who is already running against Mastriano's extremist messaging. Read more from WHYY in Philadelphia. In Idaho, Republican Gov. Brad Little is facing a challenge from his Trump-backed lieutenant governor, Janice McGeachin. McGeachin is a former state legislator who battled with Little over COVID-19 restrictions. Polling and fundraising show Little in the lead, but the primary puts McGeachin's ties to the far right on display in one of the most conservative states in the country.

Cawthorn, who has Trump's support, has been involved in several scandals that have raised skepticism as to whether he can keep his seat. In North Carolina, a winner needs to cross a 30% threshold to avoid a runoff. Read more from WUNC. There are a several notable primaries Tuesday that show divides within the Democratic Party.

And it's become an expensive contest, with candidates like state Sen. Valerie Foushee, who is more moderate, and Durham County Commissioner Nida Allam, who has received endorsements from Vermont Sen. Sanders and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Abortion has risen as an issue after the leak of a draft Supreme Court opinion on Roe v. Wade. Allam, who's 28, has been open about her own abortion story. Former American Idol star Clay Aiken is also in the race. Read more from WUNC.

            "article_content": "We look at how the fight over abortion access might turn out voters in the midterms. Also, how will the White House tackle the nation-wide shortage of baby formula?  SCOTT SIMON, HOST: And we're joined now by NPR political correspondent Juana Summers. Juana, thanks so much for being with us. JUANA SUMMERS, BYLINE: Thanks for having me. SIMON: Young voters - young potential voters - have never lived in the U.S. without guaranteed access to abortion. Are there signs political figures are seeing that should Roe v. Wade be overturned, this is going to activate young voters politically? SUMMERS: Well, Scott, that's the hope of a number of Democratic strategists that I spoke with. They think this is the type of issue that could jolt young voters to action. And we should just point out that we see from polling that young voters - they're among those groups that have soured on Democrats since 2020. When I talk to youth organizers, though, there's kind of a mixed picture. One that I spoke to made the point that while people our age, Gen Zers and millennials, have never lived in a world without the protections of Roe, they've certainly been dealing with a country in which access to abortion is challenging depending on where you live. And this organizer in Colorado that I spoke with - she pointed out to me that while the prospect of the Supreme Court striking down Roe - it's launching young people to action across the country - that action doesn't always equal voting. It could mean things like protesting or having conversations with family members or donating to abortion funds. So it's just not clear what the midterm outlook looks like on this one yet. SIMON: According to polls, the majority of Americans support keeping Roe in place, but the minority opposed is sizable and motivated. How might such a decision affect possible Republican support? SUMMERS: Yeah, well, there is certainly a good deal of concern among Republicans over how this will play in big statewide races in places like New Hampshire and Arizona. But there's also some belief that the issue of inflation will remain the top concern among voters headed to the polls. Now, in some places where Republicans have been making gains among socially conservative voters, Democrats may not want to lean in to this issue. And the place that I'm thinking about right now is in South Texas. There's a district there where there's a runoff this month where a Democratic incumbent, Congressman Henry Cuellar, who is staunchly anti-abortion rights, is being challenged by a progressive, Jessica Cisneros, who's really leaned in on this issue. Now, this is a district where there's a good number of socially conservative Latino voters, and Cuellar allies say that the only reason Democrats have been able to keep this seat is because voters there agree with Cuellar's views. And we should note this is also an area where former President Trump increased his support in 2020. So we'll be watching that closely later this month. SIMON: Of course, the nationwide baby formula shortage is a huge story this week, affecting millions of families in the most immediate and sensitive way. What's the White House saying they're going to do about it? SUMMERS: This has been a hugely frustrating issue for families across the country. The administration launched a website where parents can get information about how to find formula and also to get advice on what to do if they can't find the brand or variety they use. President Biden this week also met with formula manufacturers and retailers. He has been pushing them to step up production. And he also asked retailers what they need to help them keep their shelves stocked. And one of the things he said they asked for was more flexibility in the WIC program. Now, that's the program for low-income parents and children, and it accounts for just a huge amount of the formula consumed in this country. The Biden administration is urging states to relax their rules so that people who are participants in that program can buy different sizes or brands of formula. And I just have to note here, this has also become a massive political issue in Washington. Republicans and Democrats are pressing the White House to do something. And some lawmakers have called on the White House to invoke the Defense Production Act. That is something that was an act - was used repeatedly during the pandemic on other issues. And the White House said this week that they're looking into that, but that that would actually be bit more of a long-term solution because baby formula is really complicated to make. SIMON: Finally, Mike Pence - headed to Georgia later this month to campaign for Governor Brian Kemp, for whom President Trump has no use, against David Perdue, a candidate supported by President Trump. This is a sharp split between Pence and Trump, isn't it? SUMMERS: Yes, it is. And this comes as we've seen former Vice President Pence take a number of really big steps to distance himself from his former partner, from former President Trump. And this is, of course, all happening with the 2024 presidential race hanging in the backdrop. And that's something, of course, that could put Pence in direct competition with his former boss if they both jump into the race. I'm also watching this really closely as it's - a number of those states where we're seeing the test of President Trump - former President Trump's endorsement power as we head into 2022.

Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., blamed Democrats for the declining trust in the Supreme Court in an interview with NPR. \"The Supreme Court is not broken and doesn't need fixing,\" he said.\n                \n                    \n                    Alex Wong/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption U.S. Senate Minority Leader Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., blamed Democrats for the declining trust in the Supreme Court in an interview with NPR. \"The Supreme Court is not broken and doesn't need fixing,\" he said. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell defended the U.S. Supreme Court's potential move to issue rulings that are in conflict with a majority of Americans' views on abortion rights, telling NPR that is a feature of the system. \"So for the Supreme Court to on any issue, to reach a decision contrary to public opinion it is exactly what the Supreme Court is about,\" he said. \"It's to protect basic rights, even when majorities are in favor of something else, that happens all the time.\" McConnell pointed to a 1989 decision the court issued on flag burning, noting the Supreme Court struck down a bill that would ban it on the basis that it was a violation of the First Amendment. \"If you took public opinion polls on that issue, people would overwhelmingly support a legislative prohibition of flag burning, but the Supreme Court interpreted that as a violation of the First Amendment freedom of speech,\" he said. Democrats maintain that the leaked draft Supreme Court opinion overturning Roe v. Wade, first reported by Politico last week, upends five decades of precedent. They argue it is a product of a decades-long effort by right-leaning groups and their allies in Congress, led by McConnell, to confirm justices that would restrict or eliminate abortion rights. But McConnell insisted that his focus on installing conservative judges on the federal bench was not about any one issue, telling NPR, \"My interest in this was unrelated to any particular issue. \"But I felt very strongly that we ought to have men and women who are not what's typically referred to as 'judicial activist,'\" he said. McConnell blamed declining public trust in the Supreme Court on Democrats in Congress attacking individual justices by name and an effort by progressives to reform the structure of the court by proposing expanding its size and instituting term limits. \"It's no wonder that by politicizing the Supreme Court, like the political left has, including the Democratic leader of the Senate \u2014 it would affect their approval ratings. That needs to stop,\" he said. \"The president, who knows better, set up a commission to study the composition of the court. The Supreme Court is not broken and doesn't need fixing.\" McConnell said the debate about abortion will shift to the states. Democrats are retooling their message for the November midterms to feature the impact of the conservative majority's leaked draft opinion setting aside legal protections for abortion services. \"I think it will be certainly heavily debated in state legislative and governor's races because the court will have, in effect, returned this issue to the political process. My guess is in terms of the impact on federal races, I think it's probably going to be a wash,\" McConnell said. McConnell has steered clear of weighing in on any contentious GOP Senate primaries. Later this month, Pennsylvania holds its primary and there are several GOP candidates vying to run for the seat of retiring Sen. Pat Toomey. As he's done in the past, McConnell cautioned his party to pick nominees who are viable general election candidates. When asked about extreme positions and statements from one GOP candidate, Kathy Barnette, McConnell declined to comment on the race, but issued a warning to fellow Republicans: \"We need to nominate people who can appeal to a broader audience that you can't win with the base only,\" he said. \"And so I think the quality of the candidate who's nominated is really important.\" He said he's \"hopeful and optimistic\" the primary will \"produce fully electable people because we had a bad experience with that in 2010 and 2012,\" referring to four right wing candidates in those cycles who lost in years that were otherwise good for boosting the party's numbers in Congress. \"We have a terrific environment and I'm hoping we don't mess that up by nominating people who can't win,\" McConnell said. Democrats have pointed out that the legal reasoning the conservative majority on the Supreme Court used in the draft opinion on abortion is also the basis for laws governing same-sex marriage, in-vitro fertilization and contraception. President Biden called the Supreme Court's leaked opinion on abortion \"radical\" and said last week \"It would mean that every other decision related to the notion of privacy is thrown into question.\" McConnell declined to say whether he believed the legal framework could expand to other issues. \"I don't have any advice to give the Supreme Court. They shouldn't take my advice. Their job is to interpret the law as best they can.\" He added, \"I occasionally complain about a Supreme Court decision. I don't go over on the steps of the Supreme Court and single out justices by name. I'm certainly free to do that. And that's perfectly appropriate in our in our country. But I'm not, you know, going to start second-guessing their decisions. They are the best lawyers in the country trying to do the best job they can. All nine of them. The Kentucky Republican said he spoke by phone with Biden about the need to pass a strong funding package to assist Ukraine with security support and weapons. The Senate is expected to vote soon on a package of nearly $40 billion for Ukraine that the House passed earlier this week. McConnell said he convinced the president to separate the legislation from a COVID relief bill. McConnell said the president's handling of the issue has \"gotten better and better\" as the U.S. and the broader world community saw President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's strong pushback to the Russian invasion. \"I think the administration was a little tentative in the beginning, probably suspecting the Ukrainians couldn't pull this off,\" he said \"So we're all on the same team on this. The Russians need to lose. The Ukrainians need to win.\" But a significant bloc of House Republicans opposed the package \u2014 57 voted no earlier this week, and there's a contingent in the GOP that is advocating for an \"America First\" policy approach that former President Trump espoused during his tenure, pulling back on support for allies overseas. McConnell said about that wing of his party, \"On this issue, I don't agree with them and we'll see how big a group that is. I think we're all acutely aware of Russian atrocities. \"I think we \u2014 most Americans and most Republicans \u2014 believe that we ought to, that this is a clear example of right and wrong, of good and bad, and America and the Democratic world is standing together, by and large, in opposition to this brutal and completely unwarranted invasion.\" The GOP leader sidestepped a question about what he would do if his party regains control of the Senate and there is another vacancy on the Supreme Court: \"How that plays out on individual confirmations or legislation, I'm not prepared to announce today, but we are going to see where we can cooperate.\" McConnell blocked then-President Obama's nomination of Merrick Garland in 2016 to fill the vacancy left after the death of Justice Antonin Scalia. McConnell stressed his close coordination with two White House counsels that served in the Trump administration \u2014 Don McGahn and Pat Cipollone. As for the former president, McConnell downplayed any involvement in the process to vet and select nominees, saying, \"Well, I think he took good advice. Honestly, he was not familiar with this issue at all.\" \"He had two good White House counsels in a row who took recommendations in to him. People of like mind who came out of the Federalist Society network around the country,\" he said. \"And so it was like a farm team of potential judges. And he deserves credit for signing off on. I don't think he fundamentally knew much about this before we got elected, but I give him credit for some really good recommendations.\"",

            "article_content": "It's the hectic final few days of the Missouri legislative session and abortion is one issue on everyone's mind. Republican lawmakers want to fortify restrictions, making some voters very concerned.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Tomorrow is the last day of the legislative session in Missouri. And in that narrow window, Republican lawmakers are pushing to further restrict abortion. Here's Jason Rosenbaum of St. Louis Public Radio. (SOUNDBITE OF CAPITOL BUILDING AMBIENCE) JASON ROSENBAUM, BYLINE: In the last week of Missouri's 2022 session, lawmakers, staffers, lobbyists and curious schoolchildren are roaming around the Capitol at a frenetic pace, trying to soak in the final moments of legislative activity for the year. But State Representative Mary Elizabeth Coleman's thoughts right now aren't just on the end of a busy session. The Republican lawmaker is thinking a lot about how to protect the trigger law she helped pass in 2019. MARY ELIZABETH COLEMAN: My sister is eight years younger than me, and I remember my mom got an ultrasound and seeing the picture of the ultrasound of my little sister and how precious she is to me. And it is, in my opinion and so many others, the civil rights issue of our nation right now. ROSENBAUM: That trigger law is getting a lot of attention now because of a leaked draft of a Supreme Court decision overturning Roe vs. Wade. Coleman and other Republicans are cautious the draft may not be final, but if it is, Missouri would ban abortions with very few exceptions. Sam Lee wants to help Republicans go further by putting a measure before voters. The longtime advocate for abortion restrictions says a state constitutional amendment would protect the 2019 trigger law. SAM LEE: So we want to amend our Constitution, make it abortion-neutral so that there's no right to abortion found in the Constitution and no right for funding of abortion found in the Constitution. ROSENBAUM: Missourians may very well approve that idea. Over the years, voters have elected candidates from both parties who oppose abortion rights, but some feel that Missouri has gone too far on abortion restrictions. The trigger law was controversial because there were no exceptions for people who became pregnant because of rape or incest. Backers of the law, including Senator Andrew Koenig, defended that decision in 2019 like this. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ANDREW KOENIG: Rape and incest are horrific acts. You can't go far enough on the punishment on the people that do these acts. They're just completely horrific. We shouldn't do another bad act because one bad act happened. ROSENBAUM: Taylor Hirth, though, believes the trigger law is completely unacceptable. She was raped in her apartment in 2016. TAYLOR HIRTH: The emotional toll that that experience took on me, and then to compound that with a potential pregnancy would have just broken me. ROSENBAUM: Hirth is now an advocate for survivors of sexual violence. She says the possibility of Roe vs. Wade being overturned is motivating her about the November election. HIRTH: You know, we've got people planning marches, and I'm like, I'm so sick of marching. I'm done marching. You know, all I can do is vote, and I absolutely will be voting for people who are very vocally pro-choice and who are not afraid to make that a rally cry. ROSENBAUM: The Missouri legislature is overwhelmingly Republican, so it would take a long time to elect enough Democrats here to roll back abortion restrictions, but there's a U.S. Senate race in Missouri this year. And if a Democrat wins, it could help toward passing a federal law guaranteeing the right to an abortion everywhere. While Republicans are skeptical they will lose that race, a Democrat did win campaigning on abortion rights ten years ago. CLAIRE MCCASKILL: When I try to tell people what the law is going to be in Missouri, in about 10 minutes, most of them don't believe me. ROSENBAUM: Claire McCaskill won a landslide victory in 2012 after Republican Todd Akin said that women who are, quote, \"legitimately raped\" could shut down their pregnancies. She says it's notable that GOP leaders tried to get Akin to drop out in 2012, but now Republicans running for Senate this year embrace the state's trigger law. MCCASKILL: It's startling. It's stunning how extreme the party has become and how far they're willing to go to marginalize women in the state. ROSENBAUM: McCaskill contends that the pending Supreme Court decision could prompt Missourians to pay more attention to elections for Missouri's House and Senate, especially since they'll determine the future of abortion access if Roe vs. Wade falls.

            "article_content": "Finland's president wants his country to join NATO. The White House faces pressure to protect abortion rights after a Senate bill failed. Schools in Las Vegas experience a sharp rise in violence.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Finland's president and prime minister have put out a statement that their country must apply for NATO membership without delay. A MART\u00cdNEZ, HOST: Their statement makes it all but certain Finland will join the military alliance. Nearby, Sweden is expected to follow. For generations, Finland has been oriented toward the Western alliance but carefully stayed out of NATO. Russia's invasion of Ukraine changed that. INSKEEP: NPR's Frank Langfitt was recently in Helsinki, Finland. He's currently in Odesa, Ukraine. And he's on the line. Hey there, Frank. FRANK LANGFITT, BYLINE: Hey. Good morning, Steve. INSKEEP: How important is this call by the Finns? LANGFITT: It's huge, I mean, what we've seen, particularly since the invasion of Ukraine in late February by the Russians, this kind of reordering of the European security order. I've spent a lot of my time traveling in Europe, talking to people about it. And this sort of confirms for what many people have known for weeks, that the Finns are headed towards NATO. The Swedes and the Finns are very close politically. So Sweden is not going to want to be left out of this. And they're expected to apply and be welcomed into NATO with open arms. Now, this is really a sea change in public opinion. And it's just been in a few months, you know? If you go back, for a number of decades, people in both countries, they weren't really interested in NATO. They were - didn't want to provoke Russia. But given the unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, many Finns sort of say, well, what's the point in trying to accommodate Russia? Now, the process of joining NATO is expected to take, maybe, a number of months. But if all goes to plan, the entire Baltic Sea - that includes Sweden, Finland, the Baltic states - will effectively become a NATO lake. And of course, as we've said before, this is not at all what President Putin intended. INSKEEP: Yeah. Is there a way to measure the change in Finnish public opinion over the last couple of months? LANGFITT: Oh, it's been incredible, Steve. I mean, if you went back maybe six, seven months ago, maybe 25, 30% of people, as it always had been, were interested in NATO, not many. Right now, the latest poll I've seen is 76%. And I can tell you from just walking around Helsinki, those numbers are absolutely real. And I talked to many people who said, you know, they weren't interested in NATO, and what they've seen in Ukraine has really changed their minds. Of course, Finland and Russia, they share an 800-mile border. So this is of particular concern. And the Finnish president - it's interesting. Just yesterday, when he was signing a security agreement with the British - with Boris Johnson, he spoke rhetorically to the Russians. And he said, quote, \"you caused this. Look in the mirror.\" INSKEEP: Isn't there some relevant history here? LANGFITT: Oh, there really is. It's not the main driver. But I think it's really important context. Soviet Union invaded Finland back in 1939. This was known as the Winter War. And Russia, basically, was able to take Finnish territory that it felt it needed as protection against a possible attack from Germany. The Finns fought very hard, but eventually were overwhelmed by a bigger and better-armed Soviet force. And when I was in Helsinki, I talked to a guy named Joonas Kontta. He's a lawmaker in the Finnish parliament. And he told me his great-grandfather, Stefan (ph), lost 200 acres of forest land when Finland was forced to cede territory to the Soviets. And Kontta told me, until recently, the Winter War had seemed a bit remote. And then he said this. JOONAS KONTTA: We always honor the veterans and the people who sacrificed so much for our independence. But now, when Russia attacked Ukraine, we have these memories opened once more. And we don't want to be alone ever again. LANGFITT: When you look at the images from Ukraine, do you relate to them in any way given the history of this country? KONTTA: I do relate to them. There are a lot of civilians, cities, towns, villages that are being demolished by Russia. It's just cruelty after cruelty. LANGFITT: And so, Steve, I think, for many Finns, these old wounds from a war that was many, many decades ago are really - you know, to some degree, really resonating again. INSKEEP: Frank, always appreciate your insights. Thanks so much. LANGFITT: Great to talk, Steve. INSKEEP: That's NPR's Frank Langfitt. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MART\u00cdNEZ: As expected, the Senate rejected a bill to assure abortion rights. And Vice President Kamala Harris urged her side of that debate to look at the next election. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KAMALA HARRIS: This vote clearly suggests that the Senate is not where the majority of Americans are on this issue. Our priority should be to elect pro-choice leaders at the local, the state and the federal level. INSKEEP: The country is awaiting a Supreme Court ruling that could throw out the constitutional right to an abortion. That would throw power back to the states. Though, President Biden also faces questions about what he could do. MART\u00cdNEZ: NPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith has been looking into all of this. Tamara, so what political pressure is the White House facing? TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Abortion rights advocates are encouraging the administration to do whatever it can to make it easier for people to get abortion services. And advocates I've spoken with also want the president to use his bully pulpit to raise alarms about the consequences of overturning Roe v. Wade. But there's also an acknowledgement that if Roe does fall, it's not like the president can sign an executive order and just bring it back. That's not the way our system works. As Morgan Hopkins, interim executive director of the abortion rights group All* Above All, put it to me, they want the White House to get creative and try actions even if they aren't guaranteed to hold up in court. MORGAN HOPKINS: And we've seen in the pandemic what is possible and what the federal government can do in a public health crisis, which this will be, a public health crisis. And we want to see that same kind of energy for people who are going to need abortion care. MART\u00cdNEZ: So what would that look like? I mean, what is the White House considering? KEITH: They aren't revealing a lot of details yet. Press Secretary Jen Psaki says the president has been in meetings with people from across the government, working through possibilities. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JEN PSAKI: Having the Gender Policy Council, our counsel's office and the Department of Health and Human Services come up with options and proposals for what we would do were this opinion issued to be final or a version of it to be final. So those are ongoing internal meetings. KEITH: Psaki said the goal is making sure those who become pregnant in states that severely restrict or ban abortion are still able to get access to these services somehow. But she really did not get into specifics. And a White House official told me that some of the ideas being floated by advocates aren't even being considered by the White House. So take all of this with a grain of salt. But some I've spoken to say that Medicaid could provide funding for patients to travel from states that don't allow abortions to states that do. But this idea isn't a sure thing because every federal budget includes a provision that prevents federal funds from being spent on abortion services. The federal government could also potentially provide grants to states that still allow abortions to help them deal with an expected influx of patients. And the administration could work to make sure patients can still gain access to medication abortions, even as some states try to ban FDA-approved abortion pills. MART\u00cdNEZ: OK. So if the options are so limited, then why is the White House still under so much pressure to do something? KEITH: Plain and simple, this issue matters a lot to a lot of Democratic voters. So just like that failed Senate vote yesterday, Democratic politicians have to demonstrate that they are doing everything they can even as, one expert I spoke to said, the options are very limited and amount to nibbling around the edges. MART\u00cdNEZ: NPR's Tamara Keith. Thanks a lot. KEITH: You're welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MART\u00cdNEZ: In Las Vegas, Nev., a 16-year-old student is facing charges of attempted murder and sexual assault for attacking his teacher in class last month. INSKEEP: That's one of many recent violent school incidents in the nation's fifth largest school district. Students and parents call this a distraction from learning and say they deserve safe schools. MART\u00cdNEZ: NPR's Kirk Siegler joins us now to share what he's found after visiting local high schools. Kirk, what does the situation in Las Vegas - what about it stands out? KIRK SIEGLER, BYLINE: Well, A, nationally, there's been some reporting of an uptick in violence and harassment directed at teachers. And it appears that things may be worse in Vegas. The statistics aren't perfect. But if you look at calls from Clark County schools to police dispatch, there have been more than 8,300 responding to violence so far this school year. That's some 1,300 more than in the entire 2018-'19 school year. And the thing is, A, it's not just students attacking teachers or doing the fighting, it's parents, too. Another high-profile attack happened at Desert Oasis High School. A YouTube video captures a brawl in the high school quad. And you can see a dad right there in the middle taking swings. (CROSSTALK) SIEGLER: Now, parents, like Cherish Morgan, were outside on the sidewalk, frantically texting their kids who were trapped inside. CHERISH MORGAN: Listen; our principal and our teachers should not be jumping on top of a parent to stop him from beating a student. That's - in what - there's no world where that is OK, there's just not. SIEGLER: And, A, in the world of Vegas, if you will, violence has long been a problem. Think of the mafia's ties to this town. But since the pandemic, things have been especially tense - violent threats, harassment, theft, assaults and guns increasingly spilling into places a lot of folks thought once is safe. MART\u00cdNEZ: Kirk, how does mental health play into all this? SIEGLER: Well, Nevada ranks last in the nation for mental health access. There were 18 suicides during the one year and three months that schools went all-virtual. That's 15 months of virtual learning. That's a lot of stress and social isolation. And, you know, the pandemic also hit Vegas' economy really hard. So many people lost jobs when the casinos and entertainment industry shut down. There's just a lot of stress there as well. MART\u00cdNEZ: So what's being done about it? SIEGLER: Well, the district announced a slate of new safety measures after the 16-year-old student you mentioned, who attacked his teacher, was charged with attempted murder. They include panic buttons in classrooms, more security cameras, tougher penalties for students involved in the violence, as well as more mental health services, though, that's a funding issue. Jesus Jara is the CCSD superintendent. Let's hear from him. JESUS JARA: The violence and the acts is what we're seeing across the country. And it's not just in schools, right? I mean, we're seeing it around adults. So it's now, how do we refocus our children to make sure that they stay focused in the classroom? SIEGLER: But as the district in Vegas tries to address the rise in violence, you know, they also face a $6 billion deficit in maintenance and infrastructure. There's, as a result of all of this, pressure. There's a new ad hoc group of parents and students. And they're calling on Nevada's governor to hold a special legislative session to address the crisis. And, A, I would say the district is using federal funds for recruitment and retention bonuses for its beleaguered staff. You can imagine morale is pretty low. There are 1,000 open teaching positions. The district says the violence tends to be perpetrated by only a small group of students. It's getting a lot of attention, though. And things have quieted down, at least some, as the end of the school year approaches. So that's some positive news in this troubling story. MART\u00cdNEZ: NPR's Kirk Siegler. Thanks a lot.

            "article_content": "Senate Democrats tried, and failed, to advance legislation to establish a federal law to protect abortion access nationwide.  AILSA CHANG, HOST: Today, Senate Democrats tried and failed to advance a bill to require equal access to abortion nationwide. All but one of the Senate's 50 Democrats voted for it. That one Democrat was West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin, who sided with all the Republicans in opposition to the bill. Democrats were responding to a recently leaked Supreme Court draft opinion that would overturn Roe v. Wade and would ultimately allow states to ban or restrict abortion access. Now, the final court decision is expected next month. And joining us now is NPR congressional correspondent Susan Davis. Hey, Sue. SUSAN DAVIS, BYLINE: Hey, Ailsa. CHANG: OK. I mean, it was a given that Democrats didn't have enough votes to advance an abortion bill in the Senate. So what was the point of today's vote? DAVIS: You know, really, the only thing Democrats can do here is try to create political pressure against Republicans going into the election. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said as much this morning on the Senate floor. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CHUCK SCHUMER: Tens of millions of women are watching what will happen to the rights they've relied on for decades. And all of us will have to answer for this vote for the rest of our time in public office. DAVIS: Democrats remain confident they have public opinion on their side - most Americans in polls say they do believe women should have some level of access to abortion procedures - but they're essentially powerless to do anything to stop the court if they rule to overturn Roe, despite controlling Congress and the White House. The realities of the 50-50 Senate have not changed. Democrats don't have the votes to change the Senate filibuster rules to make it easier to pass legislation. And today's vote also proved they don't even have a simple majority of support to pass the bill, even if they did. CHANG: Yeah. I mean, what about Manchin? I mean, hasn't he said that he does support codifying Roe v. Wade into federal law? But he voted against the bill today. Why? DAVIS: He also voted against a similar bill back in February. Manchin supports some level of basic abortion access, but he's always been more of a socially conservative Democrat, and he's more supportive of restrictions around abortions - think of things like mandatory waiting periods or requiring ultrasounds before an abortion can be performed. He told reporters he feared that this bill would go too far, that it would supersede states that have restrictions like that in place, and he didn't support that. He wanted more of a pared down bill. CHANG: Well, what about two Republican women senators? I'm talking about Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. I mean, they both openly support Roe v. Wade, but they voted against the bill today. How did they explain that? DAVIS: They shared a lot of those same concerns as Manchin, but they've also introduced competing legislation that would also codify Roe, it just wouldn't go as far as the Democrats' bill to protect abortion rights. It would also do more to protect people who have religious or moral opposition to abortion, and it is drawing some level of Democratic interest. Collins is talking to senators like Manchin. Another senator, Tim Kaine is a Democrat from Virginia who has also had, at least previously, some more conservative views around abortion access, certainly compared to more liberal Democrats. But at the same time, the same problem still exists. It's unlikely that they could get any additional Republicans on board for their Republican bill and highly unlikely they can get a critical mass of Democrats on board for it either. CHANG: Yeah. So if that is the case, where does this abortion debate on Capitol Hill go? DAVIS: I mean, in Congress, it's frankly going nowhere, at least not before the election. One of the big questions in the midterms is, how much of this impact have on voters? I mean, Democrats want to believe that it's going to bring voters to the polls to vote for them, but it's just not clear yet how voters are going to rank abortion in deciding how they're going to vote. And, you know, Republicans remain heavily favored to win control of the House. And if that happens, there will be zero chance of any legislation to protect abortion rights in the next Congress. CHANG: That is NPR congressional correspondent Susan Davis. Thank you, Sue. DAVIS: You're welcome. Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "Democrats are hoping voters will be more fired up to turn out for them this year because of abortion rights, but some voters in Texas expressed reservations that the party could deliver on the issue.  AILSA CHANG, HOST: If the Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade this year, will that mobilize voters this fall? Well, NPR's Ashley Lopez reports that when she spoke with Democratic voters in Texas, many say this issue is not enough to cure their current disappointment with the party. (SOUNDBITE OF KNOCKING ON DOOR) ASHLEY LOPEZ, BYLINE: It's a blistering hot Saturday afternoon in Austin, and Eric Coraggio is knocking on doors for Democratic nominee Beto O'Rourke's gubernatorial campaign. He says he decided to help out just a few days ago, when he saw that the U.S. Supreme Court is potentially poised to strike down Roe v. Wade. Coraggio says until he saw that, he wasn't all that inspired to pitch in. ERIC CORAGGIO: I was just like, oh, I'll get through it eventually. And then, like, this happened, and I was like, all right, now's the time. And so I kind of went and signed up immediately. LOPEZ: Texas is among about a dozen states with a trigger ban in effect. That means 30 days after the court issues a ruling overturning Roe v. Wade, abortion at any stage in a pregnancy will be illegal here. Coraggio says he's really concerned. CORAGGIO: It's just really upsetting. And, you know, it's been standard for 50 years now. And it's - I can't believe this is happening in America. LOPEZ: Coraggio is among thousands of new volunteers that the Beto O'Rourke campaign says it has gained in the wake of that leaked opinion. O'Rourke says he thinks all of this could help his campaign by shifting focus to a winning issue for Democrats. He says even in Texas, only a small percentage of voters support an all-out ban on abortion. According to a recent UT-Austin poll, only 15% of voters in the state would like to see the procedure completely banned. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BETO O'ROURKE: And this issue, I guarantee, is going to bring people out. And when we meet them where they are by showing up at their door and knocking on it and, in our own words, from our own heart, describing just how important this election is for all of us, we're going to see a record turnout. LOPEZ: But when Eric Coraggio actually started knocking on doors this weekend, it was hard to find voters who were inspired to vote for Democrats because of the draft opinion. One of the doors he knocked on belonged to Hillary McLachlan. She lives in South Austin. She's 54 years old and cares about women's rights and LGBTQ issues. She also has a dog. (SOUNDBITE OF DOG BARKING) CORAGGIO: Hi. Hillary? HILLARY MCLACHLAN: Yeah. CORAGGIO: Hi. I'm with the Beto campaign and wanted to know how you're voting in this election. MCLACHLAN: I honestly don't know at this point because I'm so mad at the Democratic Party. So (laughter) - I mean, I hope I'm going to be voting Democratic, but, I mean, I obviously would like Beto to win. LOPEZ: But McLachlan says she feels like she was, quote, \"bamboozled\" by Democrats. She says the party holds majorities in Congress, and yet rights like access to abortion hang in the balance at the conservative Supreme Court without a remedy from the Democrats. MCLACHLAN: Yeah, because this should have been taken care of. I mean, hopefully we can affect some change in Texas, which would be amazing. But, yeah, I'm just overall burnt out of, like, getting stepped on. LOPEZ: In general, Democrats are facing a pretty significant enthusiasm gap in Texas, says Jim Henson with the Texas Politics Project at UT-Austin. JIM HENSON: All things being equal, you have a lot more enthusiasm for Republicans than you do among Democrats, who, of course, are pretty beleaguered in Texas. LOPEZ: Henson says a lot of this could change depending on what actually happens to Roe v. Wade, though. He says if abortion is completely banned in Texas, polling shows it could be enough to engage some Democrats and independent voters who otherwise weren't too enthusiastic about voting for Democratic candidates this year. HENSON: There are some possible advantages for Democrats, you know, looming here, but we don't know still exactly how this is going to unfold. LOPEZ: As things stand right now, Eric Coraggio says it's hard to see how this will all turn out a wave of Democrats in the upcoming election. CORAGGIO: And so unfortunately, no, I don't think a lot of people will come out for this. I'm more engaged. But I went and asked all my friends, and none of them volunteered. LOPEZ: But he, too, says that could all change if Roe v. Wade is actually struck down. Coraggio says once abortions become completely inaccessible in parts of the country, he thinks people might actually get angry enough to vote. Ashley Lopez, NPR News, Austin.

Wade, it would lead to legislative battles on abortion rights all across the country. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: The biggest action would be in states, not Congress. No abortion legislation is likely to pass the divided U.S. Senate just now. But that would not stop the parties from trying. Senate Democrats already plan a vote that would codify abortion rights. And Senate Republicans have begun talking of a nationwide ban if they should regain control. This underlines a challenge for Republicans because such a ban is one of their core positions, and it's also very unpopular. MART\u00cdNEZ: NPR senior political editor and correspondent Domenico Montanaro is here with the latest on the Republican playbook. Domenico, politicians often gain a lot more by fighting over an issue than actually getting the solution that they keep saying that they're seeking. Is that part of the challenge here for Republicans? DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Well, look; it's been an issue that's been the culture war issue for Republicans in this country, firing up their base, for the better part of 50 years, you know? There's a real open question now about what the party does nationally if the Supreme Court overturns Roe, which made abortion legal in this country. About two-thirds of people say, in survey after survey, that they want Roe to be upheld and for abortion to be legal in this country but with restrictions. That's where Republicans are trying to deflect the conversation and push Democrats, on restrictions instead of overturning Roe. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell had this to say on the Senate floor yesterday. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MITCH MCCONNELL: Today's Democratic Party is profoundly out of step with the American people on this issue. Their extreme position ignores modern science and public opinion. Leader Schumer wants the Senate to vote again on a Democratic bill that would effectively legalize abortion on demand through all nine months. MART\u00cdNEZ: All right. So is that true? MONTANARO: Well, the Democratic bill doesn't really say that it would allow abortion in the third trimester in all or even most cases. What the bill says is that after viability, which is about 23 to 24 weeks, that a pregnant person would be allowed to get an abortion if there is a, quote, \"good faith medical judgment\" of the treating health care provider that the pregnancy would pose a risk to the pregnant patient's life or health. Now, what health means isn't exactly spelled out. And that's something conservatives have dug in on. But it's pretty much what's in the Roe decision itself, which says that states can, quote, \"proscribe or forbid,\" quote, \"abortion except where necessary, in appropriate medical judgment, for the preservation of the life or health of the mother.\" We should note, though, that 9 in 10 abortions take place in the first 12 weeks. More than half are by pill. And yet, what gets most of the attention and what's used in political talking points on the right are extreme examples that are exceedingly rare. The energy right now, we know, is - in Republican-led states, what they're trying to implement are more restrictions. And that's what's before the court. And the leaked court draft opinion shows a conservative majority would overturn Roe, which, as we noted, is unpopular. MART\u00cdNEZ: Now, over the weekend, Mitch McConnell said it's possible Republicans would try to pass a national ban on abortion if they got power. But that's a very unpopular position. So why would he say something like that? MONTANARO: Well, I think the thing that we need to understand is that Mitch McConnell really only cares about one thing, winning the Senate. Fifty-one seats is his top concern. He's making a base play. And he's really threatening Democrats with just how far he might go if he has the power in the Senate as a way to warn them of not going too far in getting rid of the filibuster, for example, so a bit of a game of chicken, you know? And it's not really clear Republicans have a plan nationally. If Roe is overturned, the fight would really, probably, most likely be state by state, with very different laws, depending on which party is in charge. MART\u00cdNEZ: NPR's Domenico Montanaro. Thanks a lot. MONTANARO: You're welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MART\u00cdNEZ: Voters in Nebraska cast ballots today to decide who will be their Republican candidate for governor. INSKEEP: This race is the latest test of former President Trump's influence. He's backing a wealthy political outsider named Charles Herbster. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DONALD TRUMP: We've made it very prosperous. And I really think he's going to do just a fantastic job. And if I didn't feel that, I wouldn't be here. INSKEEP: The latest polls show Mr. Herbster and Jim Pillen in a dead heat, with the third candidate close behind. MART\u00cdNEZ: With us now to discuss all this is Will Bauer of Nebraska Public Media in Lincoln. Will, so tell us about this race. Who are the leading candidates? WILL BAUER, BYLINE: Yeah. So Republican Governor Pete Ricketts is on his second term here in Nebraska, so he can't run again. His pick to carry on his legacy is University of Nebraska regent Jim Pillen. He's a traditional GOP candidate. He'll tell you right away he's a conservative Christian. Pillen is also a pig farmer and a veterinarian. So those kinds of credentials resonate well here in Nebraska, where agriculture is one of the state's top industries. There's also agricultural businessman and major GOP donor Charles Herbster. He hasn't raised a lot of money for this race. Instead, he's donated $11.5 million of his own money. And he's hoping Trump's endorsement will win support from Nebraskans. There's also this third GOP candidate in the primary, who's polling at roughly the same numbers as the other two. That's State Senator Brett Lindstrom of Omaha. And he's only 41 years old but has the most state government experience in the primary. He's also slightly a more moderate candidate. MART\u00cdNEZ: Now, we've mentioned President Trump. What role is the former president playing in this race? BAUER: Well, Trump and Herbster made a stop last week together in Nebraska. And a few thousand Nebraskans watched. Herbster is someone who supported Trump for a long time now. He was actually in Washington at the January 6 rally that preceded the insurrection. Herbster is someone who models himself after Trump. In the last few weeks, he's referenced a conspiracy theory linking China, the coronavirus pandemic and 2020 election results. A few weeks ago, eight women, including a state senator, alleged Herbster inappropriately touched or forcibly kissed them. Women have also accused Trump of various inappropriate behaviors over the years. Both men, of course, deny the charges. Herbster is suing the state senator, who's accused him of groping, for slander. She's filed a countersuit. And now, John Hibbing is a political science professor at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. He's a longtime observer of state politics. I spoke with him about just how impactful the allegations will be on voters here. JOHN HIBBING: The question is, are these Nebraska Republicans really going to stick with the Trump candidate even in the face of all these allegations? Or will they cut their losses and go with somebody who is kind of like Trump but not endorsed by Trump? MART\u00cdNEZ: Will, why is there so much attention on this primary? BAUER: Well, one of the reasons could be that thousands of voters who were registered as Democrats or Independents have joined the Republican Party over the last two months. Hibbing, the political science professor, says most of them will likely be voting for Lindstrom. He says Pillen could be an option, too, but Herbster less so. About 24% of voters are undecided headed into the polls today, according to surveys by all three of the candidates. And one of the main reasons people may be switching is because the winner of today's Republican primary is widely expected to go on to win the general election. The last time a Democrat was elected governor here in Nebraska was 1995. MART\u00cdNEZ: That's Nebraska Public Media's Will Bauer. Will, thanks a lot. BAUER: You bet. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MART\u00cdNEZ: Sri Lanka has endured months of food and fuel shortages, then weeks of anti-government protests and now violence. (SHOUTING) INSKEEP: We are listening as supporters and critics of the government clash. This happened overnight in the capital, Colombo. There were other incidents across the country. At least seven people have been killed. Hundreds were wounded. And the prime minister of Sri Lanka has now resigned. MART\u00cdNEZ: NPR's Lauren Frayer covers Sri Lanka and has been monitoring these events from our bureau in Mumbai. Lauren, what's the situation right now in Sri Lanka? LAUREN FRAYER, BYLINE: Well, at first, this morning, there was sort of an eerie calm after this night of horrible violence. Even the highway toll booths were just empty, deserted. Trade unions have called a nationwide strike. But protesters are now amassing again in the capital, Colombo. The prime minister, Mahinda Rajapaksa - or I should call him ex-prime minister now. He and his family have been evacuated from their Colombo home in a pre-dawn special forces operation. Their ancestral home, meanwhile, in another part of the island was set on fire by protesters. Here's the thing. The prime minister's brother is still the democratically elected president of Sri Lanka, Gotabaya. Rajapaksa And the Rajapaksa brothers have been the focus of weeks of protests by some of their countrymen, who blame them for mismanaging this economic crisis. Protesters are now lining routes to the airport. They suspect that the Rajapaksa brothers may try to flee the country. They don't want that to happen. Opposition leaders are calling for them to face charges. So there's a real political crisis here on top of a very dire economic one as well. MART\u00cdNEZ: How did things get so bad in Sri Lanka? FRAYER: Yeah. So the Rajapaksa brothers are accused of mismanaging the economic crisis. But they're not solely the cause of it. Sri Lanka's just had some bad luck in recent years. The economy relies on tourism and remittances from abroad. Both of those things were really hard hit by the pandemic. And tourism was hurt even before that by those horrific 2019 Easter Sunday bombings. Sri Lanka was victim of these terrible terror attacks that killed more than 200 people on Easter 2019. So the country was low on foreign currency reserves to begin with. And that's what the government uses, basically U.S. dollars to buy fuel. And so the country has suffered shortages of cooking gas and fuel for power plants. Then what happened to the world? The Ukraine war sent oil and coal prices through the roof and exacerbated everything. So Sri Lanka right now is suffering inflation of upwards of 20%, rolling blackouts, shortages of food and fuel, as I mentioned. And it's a real scene of desperation. And now we've got a heat wave on top of it. So... MART\u00cdNEZ: Wow. FRAYER: ...Sri Lanka shows us how societies can explode and come apart when climate and economic crises come together and make people very uncomfortable. MART\u00cdNEZ: Yeah. That's a lot happening all at once. Lauren, what's next there? FRAYER: Well, the prime minister's resignation means that the cabinet is dissolved. And that means there is no finance minister whose job it is to negotiate with the International Monetary Fund on bailout loans. And that's an international bailout package that Sri Lanka just desperately needs right now. MART\u00cdNEZ: NPR's Lauren Frayer. Thank you very much. FRAYER: You're welcome. Thank you.

Pete Ricketts, right, on Jan. 18 at the state Capitol in Lincoln, Neb. According to the AP, Pillen won the Republican primary May 10. In Nebraska, Jim Pillen has won the Republican primary for governor, according to a race call from The Associated Press. Riding the endorsement of Gov. Pete Ricketts and much of the state's GOP establishment, Pillen, a hog producer and University of Nebraska regent, held off rival candidates that included Charles Herbster \u2014 a political newcomer backed by former President Donald Trump \u2014 and state Sen. Brett Lindstrom. Pillen's win is a loss for Trump and the power of his endorsement, which has seemed to push other Republicans in prominent primaries to victory this year, including in West Virginia Tuesday and in Ohio last week. Trump and his son, Donald Trump Jr., came to Nebraska to campaign for Herbster, a wealthy businessman who donated $11.5 million of his own money to his campaign. The stump speeches and spending weren't enough to beat Pillen in the end, who raised $8.4 million. Herbster could have suffered among voters after the Nebraska Examiner published a story detailing allegations from eight women that he groped or forcibly kissed them. Herbster later filed a defamation lawsuit against state Sen. Julie Slama, one of the accusers. Slama has filed a countersuit. Pillen, meanwhile, campaigned on his opposition to abortion rights and critical race theory. He also says he supports restricted government and making Nebraska more friendly to agricultural business.

The Republican will face Democrat Carol Blood in the November general elections. Blood, a Nebraska state senator, cruised to victory Tuesday night. Her challenger Roy Harris made very few public campaign appearances. Pillen is widely expected to take office in November. The last time a Democrat won a statewide office was 2006 when Nebraska voters reelected Ben Nelson to the U.S. Senate. Nelson was also the last Democratic governor in the state, serving from 1991 to 1999.",

The White House is saying the country is at \"serious risk\" of a nationwide ban on abortion two days after Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said it was possible for lawmakers to pursue codifying the Supreme Court's leaked draft opinion overturning Roe v. Wade. In an interview with USA Today published over the weekend, McConnell said if the draft represented the final ruling, \"legislative bodies ... certainly could legislate in that area.\" As of now, the leaked opinion from the court would allow states to implement their own abortion bans, but it would not ban abortion on the national level. \"If this were the final decision, that was the point that it should be resolved one way or another in the legislative process. So yeah, it's possible,\" he said. The Senate would need 60 votes to codify that kind of legislation, which with the filibuster is currently not likely. But McConnell's statement certainly puts more pressure on Democrats to hold their control of the Senate in this year's midterm elections. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee responded to McConnell's comments over the weekend: \"Mitch McConnell confirmed what voters have long known: Republicans will use every tool they can, from the courts to Congress, to make abortion illegal everywhere and strip away a woman's right to make our own decisions. For voters, the stakes of protecting and expanding our Democratic Senate Majority in 2022 have never been higher.\" At Monday's White House daily briefing, press secretary Jen Psaki responded to McConnell's comments by mentioning Republican lawmakers' efforts in Mississippi and Louisiana to criminalize abortions and target birth control. \"I think we're at serious risk,\" Psaki said when asked how at risk the country was to completely outlawing abortion. The Senate on Wednesday will vote on a bill to create a federal right to have an abortion, but the effort appears symbolic and unlikely to overcome a Republican filibuster. Protests against the Supreme Court's leaked draft opinion on overturning abortion rights garnered a response from both the White House and Republican leaders on Monday, as well. Over the weekend, protesters peacefully rallied outside the homes of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh and Chief Justice John Roberts, and there were also protests in other major cities across the country. In Madison, Wis., authorities said they are investigating possible arson at an anti-abortion group's office. \".@POTUS strongly believes in the Constitutional right to protest. But that should never include violence, threats, or vandalism,\" Psaki tweeted Monday morning. \"Judges perform an incredibly important function in our society, and they must be able to do their jobs without concern for their personal safety.\" .@POTUS strongly believes in the Constitutional right to protest. But that should never include violence, threats, or vandalism. Judges perform an incredibly important function in our society, and they must be able to do their jobs without concern for their personal safety. Republicans weaponized the protests. McConnell called them \"an attempt to replace the rule of law with the rule of mobs.\" Psaki responded to McConnell's comments during the White House press briefing. \"We are a country that promotes democracy and we certainly allow for peaceful protest in a range of places in the county. None of it should violate the law. No one is suggesting that, and it should never resort to violence, to threats, to intimidation in any way, shape, or form,\" Psaki said. Just before adjourning on Monday, the Senate passed by unanimous consent  legislation that would \"allow the Supreme Court of the United States Police to provide the families of Supreme Court Justices with around-the-clock security protection.\" The bill was introduced by Democratic Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware and Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas. This Saturday, another wave of pro-abortion rights protests are expected for a \"Bans Off Our Bodies\" day of action, organized by Planned Parenthood organizations, Women's March and other groups.",

Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel says she won't enforce her state's 1931 abortion law \u2014 and she's hoping the Michigan Supreme Court finds it unconstitutional, even if the U.S. Supreme Court strikes down its Roe v. Wade decision. \"I'm very hopeful,\" Nessel said on NBC's Meet the Press, that Michigan's Supreme Court will find the right to an abortion is assured by the state constitution's equal protection and due process clauses \u2014 \"even if the United States Supreme Court decides otherwise.\" Michigan's 1931 law defined abortion as a felony. It came under attack by its own government last month, when Gov. Gretchen Whitmer sued to vacate the ban. The push quickly gained new urgency after a draft opinion leaked that would overturn the landmark Roe v. Wade ruling on abortion rights. If the Supreme Court overturns its abortion ruling, Michigan's law would again take effect, making it illegal to perform abortions in many circumstances, including in cases of rape and incest. The law also forbids using drugs to induce an abortion. \"I refuse to enforce this draconian law,\" Nessel said, adding later, \"It's a really scary set of circumstances for women here in Michigan.\" Nessel says she's concerned it could have a chilling effect on doctors' willingness to perform procedures on people whose pregnancies are no longer viable, out of fear they'd be be exposed to potential charges. \"You won't have basic medical health care that is required for women not to have extreme health problems or even die,\" she said. \"Doctors simply are not going to perform those procedures anymore because they don't want to go to prison for it.\" Nessel has spoken out against Michigan's law several times since the draft opinion leaked. She also says she herself underwent a procedure that would likely be considered illegal under the state's law. At the time, she was pregnant with triplets \u2014 but they weren't developing as they should. \"And I was told very, very specifically that there was no way that all three would make it to term...But if I aborted one, that it was possible that the other two might live. ...I took my doctor's advice... And you know what? It turned out that he was right. And now I have two beautiful sons.\" Republicans' attempts to ban abortion are out of step with what the public wants, Nessel said. A recent Pew Research Center poll showed that about six in 10 Americans favor legal abortion in all or most cases. She also noted that earlier on Sunday's program, Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves, a Republican, refused to say whether he would sign legislation banning contraceptives, if such a measure were to reach his desk. \"That is not in line at all with how Americans see their rights,\" Nessel said. \"And politicians do not belong in our doctor's offices. They don't belong in our bedrooms, and they should not be making these kinds of decisions on behalf of the American public and on behalf of women across America.\" Even if Michigan's high court strikes down the 1931 law, Nessel said, abortion rights should be codified into the state constitution. A petition drive is currently underway in Michigan to put a reproductive rights amendment on the ballot for this November's election.",

After a draft opinion suggested that the Supreme Court could overturn Roe v. Wade, President Biden and other Democrats called on voters to send more lawmakers who support abortion rights to Washington. \"If the court does overturn Roe, it will fall on our nation's elected officials at all levels of government to protect a woman's right to choose,\" Biden said in a written statement the day after the draft opinion was reported. \"And it will fall on voters to elect pro-choice officials this November.\" For Arekia Bennett-Scott, those words fell flat. \"It didn't feel like an urgency for the White House, a fight that they want to, like, get out in front of,\" she said. Bennett-Scott is the executive director of Mississippi Votes, a youth advocacy group. Her state's only abortion provider is at the center of the case that could strike down the landmark law that has stood for half a century. \"The rest of the country is going to wake up in Mississippi the day Roe v. Wade is overturned,\" she said. With six months to go until November's midterms, key components of the broad, multigenerational coalition of voters that powered Democratic victories in 2018 and 2020 are showing signs of dampened enthusiasm. Some party leaders hope that the prospect of a Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade could reenergize them. \"Voters have struggled with a believability gap, with majorities noting that they did not believe Roe was truly at risk,\" said Laphonza Butler, the head of EMILY's List, a national group that backs women candidates who support abortion rights. \"Now that the Supreme Court's pending decision to overturn Roe all together has leaked, we believe voters are galvanized to take action.\" Polling shows that most young people oppose completely overturning Roe. \"We have got to connect these generations so that the experiences of pre-Roe v. Wade can be made much more clear and tangible to young voters who haven't lived a time without Roe v. Wade being the law of the land,\" Butler said. Nicole Hensel, the executive director of the youth-focused group New Era Colorado, said that while young people haven't lived in a country without Roe, \"that doesn't mean that young people don't know what it feels like to live without access to abortion.\" \"This fight is the ability to control other people's bodies. And that is something that young people are very fearful of and also energized to resist,\" she added. But Hensel pointed out that while the prospect of the Supreme Court striking down Roe is launching young people to action \u2014 that action doesn't always equal voting. It could mean things like protesting, having conversations with family members or people in their communities or getting involved at the local level. \"If we want young people to mobilize for the midterms, then politicians can't pay lip service to these issues. They need to show that they're willing to take bold action,\" she said. Hensel said she wants to see the Senate vote to codify abortion rights into law \u2014 something the Senate plans to hold a vote on next week. The legislation does not have the support to be enacted. If Roe is overturned, individual states would decide whether abortions would be legal. In Kansas, the right to an abortion is currently protected by the state's constitution. But that could change in August when the state's voters have their say on a constitutional amendment. \"There's a lot of anger and distrust in political institutions right now. But we know that we can't cede that ground,\" said Melissa Stiehler, the advocacy director for Loud Light, a Kansas-based group focused on engaging young people. She says young voters are looking for \"unapologetic leadership.\" \"You've got folks who are talking about abortion access, but not even using the word abortion. You have politicians who are claiming that this is an incredibly divisive issue when, time and time again, every poll shows that the majority of voters do not want Roe overturned,\" she said. \"And that is what we're seeing in our future that is more real than ever. These are not hypothetical things.\"",

A leaked draft opinion in the Supreme Court case Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization has placed uncertainty on the future of abortion rights in the United States. As written, the opinion would overturn Roe v. Wade protections. We at Short Wave were immediately curious about the data behind abortions: What happens when pregnant people are denied abortions? For answers, we turned to Dr. Diana Greene Foster, the lead researcher on the interdisciplinary team behind The Turnaway Study. For over a decade, she and her fellow researchers followed just under a thousand women who sought an abortion across 21 states. These data may give us insight into pregnant people's lives in a post Roe v. Wade United States.

            "article_content": "Abortion is now front and center on the minds of many Democrats, but surprisingly many Republicans are focusing more on the leak of the Supreme Court draft opinion, not on the substance of it.  AYESHA RASCOE, HOST: Joining me now to talk about the political storm over abortion is NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson. First, Mara, has there been any fallout for the Supreme Court since the draft opinion in the abortion rights case was leaked to Politico? MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Yes, there has been. We still don't know who leaked it. There are two schools of thought on that. First, it was an anti-abortion cleric or justice who leaked it in order to lock in votes for overturning Roe; second, it was a liberal cleric or justice who wanted to raise the alarm. But we don't know the answer to that. But we do know that it's diminished trust among the justices, yet another institution further polarized. And on Friday in Atlanta, Justice Clarence Thomas spoke to the 11th Circuit Judicial Conference, and he said that government institutions should not be bullied into giving the outcomes certain people want. Democrats, of course, said wasn't that exactly what Thomas's wife, Ginni Thomas, was doing when she sent 29 text messages to the Trump White House around January 6, urging them to keep fighting to overturn the results of the 2020 election - an outcome that she didn't like? But I think the bottom line is that last week's leak is just another blow to the high court's disappearing image as some kind of nonpartisan umpire that calls balls and strikes. RASCOE: OK. So, I mean, what about the political fallout over this draft opinion? Obviously you're looking at the politics of this. LIASSON: Sure. Democrats are outraged. They hope this will energize their voters. What's been surprising has been the reaction of Republicans in Washington who are not rejoicing loudly along with their base of pro-life activists, maybe because they understand they have not won the battle for hearts and minds on this issue. Polls continue to show a big majority of Americans favor keeping Roe rather than getting rid of it. I guess I'd describe the political battle that's shaping up as which party can be painted as more extreme on abortion, and which party can capture consensus opinion on this issue? And, believe it or not, there is a consensus on this. This used to be understood as abortion being safe, legal and rare. In other words, people are uncomfortable with no restrictions. They don't want abortion on demand, but they want to keep Roe. They don't want abortion made illegal after 15 weeks. They don't like it when the law starts prosecuting patients and providers. That's why the National Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee is advising their candidates to stress that they're not against contraception. They don't want to jail women or their doctors. But that's hard when Republican state legislators around the country are talking about criminalizing abortion, getting rid of exceptions for rape and incest, giving the embryo rights at fertilization. Even Mitch McConnell, the Republican Senate leader, told USA Today that legislation creating a national ban on abortion was, quote, \"possible.\" RASCOE: But Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer says there will be a vote next week on a bill to protect abortion access. But that's another very long shot in the Senate, right? LIASSON: Right. Democrats don't have the votes to pass that bill. It's a messaging bill. And that's why Democratic strategists say Democrats have to be really careful that they don't get painted as the party of abortion on demand, that they become the party of abortion being safe, legal and rare. RASCOE: But, Mara, like, how much of this is actually going to affect the midterms? Is abortion going to be a motivator, especially when you have things out there like inflation and, you know, those kind of pocketbook issues? LIASSON: That is the giant question here. Will this issue do more than just change some races around the edges? Will this help Democrats close the enthusiasm gap? Their voters are less excited about the election, less likely to turn out than Republicans. Inflation and the economy are still the No. 1 issues. If inflation sticks around, if COVID sticks around, this is still a sour electorate that's unhappy with the party in power. And we don't know how much the abortion debate is going to change that. RASCOE: OK. In the minute we have left, we talked before about whether Donald Trump's endorsement is a kingmaker. There were some tests last week. What did we find? LIASSON: Well, we found out that in Ohio, he is the kingmaker. He endorsed J.D. Vance, who was polling in single digits. But then Vance surged, clinched the nomination. Trump wants to do the same thing in Pennsylvania, where he's endorsed celebrity Dr. Mehmet Oz. Oz is running against David McCormick, whose wife served in the Trump White House, but Trump is leaning hard against McCormick. And at a rally on Friday, he called McCormick a, quote, \"liberal Wall Street Republican who managed money for communist China.\" Here's what he said. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DONALD TRUMP: So I don't know David well, and he may be a nice guy. But he's not MAGA. He's not MAGA. LIASSON: Yeah. He went on to say, He's not my guy. And what is really McCormick's big sin? Talking about Trump's responsibility for the January 6 insurrection. And he has refused to support Trump's big lie that he was the true winner of the 2020 election. RASCOE: That's NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson. Thank you. LIASSON: Thank you.

            "article_content": "A counter-protestor holds a large cross during a youth pro-abortion rights rally outside of the Supreme Court in Washington, D.C., on May 5, following the leak of a draft Supreme Court opinion to overturn Roe v. Wade.\n                \n                    \n                    Anadolu Agency via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption A counter-protestor holds a large cross during a youth pro-abortion rights rally outside of the Supreme Court in Washington, D.C., on May 5, following the leak of a draft Supreme Court opinion to overturn Roe v. Wade. The U.S. Supreme Court's apparently imminent decision to overturn its landmark Roe v. Wade ruling on abortion rights has dominated the news as few other stories ever have. Even in a week of riveting stories erupting from the Ukraine to the Federal Reserve, the nation's media devoted themselves to abortion. No type was too big, no broadcast intro too hot. Cue the thunder and lightning. This was news. It would have been impossible to imagine all this when the Roe ruling came out in 1973. In fact, it's hard to believe today how little appreciation there was at the time for the decision's eventual impact and importance. Yet it is no exaggeration to say that since Roe, American politics have never been the same. In the 1960s, abortion had gone from being a whisper in private to a topic for heated public argument. But it was Roe that would transform that issue into a political force that has only grown since. What had been presumptions of American politics for a century \u2013 the partisan alignment of Catholics and Protestants, the dominant parties in the North and the South \u2013 would be radically altered. Many a star would fall from high office, and many new stars would be born. The reaction to Roe was immense, but not immediately so. It took months and years for the anti-abortion movement to fully form, to organize and gain political power \u2013 first in state legislatures and in Congress. Along the way, the movement helped elect four Republican presidents who would in turn appoint all of the Supreme Court justices now expected to overturn Roe. Each is a member of the conservative Federalist Society, which began in law schools in the years after Roe. It has flourished, eventually producing hundreds of federal judges, most of those currently serving appointed in the one term of former President Trump. Today, observers tend to agree that this impending decision about Roe, like the one in 1973, has the potential to energize millions who have not been as politically active. But we can only speculate as to what that will mean. America could not foresee all the ramifications of Roe then. Do we think we can see the future more clearly now? We usually look to the past as some sort of guide. But in this case, looking back mostly reminds us of how much certain things have changed. In January 1973, a reporter at Time magazine got wind of the Roe decision in a message from a Supreme Court clerk who thought he was just offering background guidance ahead of the release. The announcement was delayed, and Time had to sit on the news for a week until its next edition appeared on newsstands (a perfect symbol of old school). This time around, Politico shared the leak online late Monday and it was everywhere around the world within minutes. Back in 1973, Chief Justice Warren Burger had reportedly held back the Roe release to avoid distracting from that week's inaugural festivities as President Richard Nixon began his second term. Still, Burger did not expect the decision to be all that disruptive or have the \"consequences\" predicted by the dissenting justices. \"Plainly,\" he wrote in his own concurrence with the Jan. 22 decision, \"the Court today rejects any claim that the Constitution requires abortion on demand.\" Abortion opponents nonetheless saw it as such. The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops condemned it immediately and began its long campaign against it. But the issue was not on everyone's mind that winter. The cases that had reached the Supreme Court in that session had been in the news but were scarcely household names. Nixon's chief of staff did not mention the ruling in his diary for Jan. 22, distracted by preparations for a Vietnam peace deal announcement and the news that former President Lyndon Johnson had died that same day. Johnson's death was the dominating headline story in The New York Times the next day, with a double-deck headline across the eight-column format and a formal portrait. Roe was a second lead in lesser type. Roe had been the lead story the night before on CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite. The venerable anchor read a short intro calling it \"a landmark ruling\" and adding that the abortion laws of 46 states had been \"rendered unconstitutional.\" Cronkite tossed to reporter George Herman, who summed up the ruling as the camera panned over an artist's drawing of the nine justices. Herman said the White House had declined to comment but that Nixon had always been opposed to legalized abortion. The report was less than three-and-a-half minutes. Nixon had brought up the decision in a chat with aides that evening \u2014 captured by an automatic taping system \u2014 but without much heat. On the tape he can be heard to say \"there are times when abortions are necessary, I know that ... you know ... between a Black and a white.\" When an aide added: \"Or rape.\" Nixon agreed: \"Or rape ... you know what I mean. There are times.\" Biographer John Farrell has written that Nixon told his team not to emphasize issues such as abortion. He quotes one policy aide saying that for Nixon, those issues \"weren't even on the table.\" For most American news consumers, Roe was soon buried beneath other preoccupations. The winding down of the Vietnam War was soon be eclipsed by news of a scandal left over from the 1972 campaign. Burglars who had broken into the Democratic national headquarters in the Washington's Watergate office complex were paid hush money that would be traced back to the Nixon campaign. The White House involvement would be slowly, painfully exposed \u2013 with the ultimate evidence coming from White House tapes. Hearings in the Senate were followed by dramatic firings and resignations, impeachment hearings in the House and Nixon's resignation in August 1974. Meanwhile, the Yom Kippur War in the Middle East had led to the Arab oil embargo and quadrupled the price of oil \u2014 and the price at the gas pump \u2013 fueling inflation that would continue for a decade. By the time voters got to the polls for the midterms of 1974, abortion was far from uppermost on most minds. In 1976, the Democratic Party nominated Jimmy Carter, who was personally opposed to abortion but also opposed a constitutional amendment to overturn Roe. The Republican Party nominated incumbent President Gerald Ford, who opposed abortion and supported a constitutional amendment, although his  wife and vice president were known to see the issue differently. Both parties' platforms then acknowledged with respect the division of opinion within their own ranks, though the platforms diverged on the need for a constitutional amendment. Once elected, Carter installed an anti-abortion Catholic as his secretary of Health and Human Services. Carter's years in office were a time of conservative pushback in the country on a number of fronts, from tax policy to school desegregation. In an early sign of its rising power, the anti-abortion movement amassed votes in both parties in Congress to approve the Hyde Amendment, banning the use of federal funding to pay for abortions. Hyde has been renewed ever since, despite efforts under Democratic majorities to repeal it. Another watershed for the anti-abortion movement was the rise of Ronald Reagan, who had the support of many social conservatives when he challenged Ford for the nomination in 1976. By the time the 1980 nominating contest arrived, Reagan was ascendant. He won the South Carolina primary, dominated by evangelical white voters. Many of these were recent converts to Republicanism drawn to Reagan, following the lead of some of their favorite TV preachers such as Jerry Falwell. Reagan was able to sound less harsh about abortion, while still stressing the need for a constitutional amendment to overturn Roe. In office, Reagan would focus on national security, cutting taxes and restraining federal spending. Lou Dobbs, a reporter who followed Reagan's career closely for 30 years, has written: \"While I do not doubt Reagan's sincerity in advocating an anti-abortion amendment, he invested few political resources toward attaining this goal and it was not a high priority of those close to him.\" Nonetheless, Reagan's reelection platform 1984 had the strongest anti-abortion plank to date, and that posture has remained in place since. Thereafter, both parties' presidential candidates tried to placate passionate advocates (on one side or the other) while reassuring swing voters there would be no sudden moves. Bill Clinton, for example. had success with saying abortion should be \"safe, legal and rare.\" And while Barack Obama and the two Republicans he defeated in 2008 and 2012 stuck with their respective parties' usual postures on the issue, abortion was not salient in either campaign. Then along came Trump, who upended this equilibrium as he did so many others. As a former Democrat known for being supportive of abortion rights, he seemed an unlikely champion for anti-Roe activists. But he was able to convince many, if not all, that his conversion on the issue was genuine. More important, he convinced them he would appoint Supreme Court justices who would overturn Roe. This was a key when he, like Reagan, broke from the GOP candidate pack in his first South Carolina primary, which by 2016 was even more dominated by social conservatives than it had been in Reagan's day. And unlike others, Trump continued to accentuate the issue in the fall campaign \u2013 describing the abortion procedure in lurid terms and saying women who had abortions \"should face some sort of punishment.\" While most Americans might have found Trump's language repugnant, it caught attention and signposted once again Trump's promise regarding Roe and the courts. Democrats, for their part, have doubled down repeatedly on the side of abortion rights, linking them to their support of \"human rights\" and of groups whose rights had been long suppressed \u2013 African Americans and other minority groups, women seeking to vote and enjoy full property rights, LGBTQ people and immigrants. Republicans at all levels have often seen the Democrats' devotion to these causes as an opportunity. They have been able to appeal to previously Democratic voters who still had strong allegiance to traditional, often religious cultural and social values. This appeal has been especially potent in rural America and smaller communities beyond the metropolitan areas. Catholics had been a Democratic bloc from their first emergence as a political force in the mid-1800s to the 1960s. As part of the New Deal coalition, they gave the party the lion's share of their votes. But that began to change after 1964, as the Democratic Party changed. And it accelerated in the 1970s after Roe. Today, Catholics overall are split almost evenly in party loyalty. But white Catholics tend to be Republican. Polling has shown about 6 in 10 Catholics voted for Trump in 2016 and 2020. Trump did even better than that among white Protestants who identify themselves as evangelical, a somewhat loose designation that separates them from the \"mainline\" Protestant denominations. Evangelicals are particularly important as an electoral force in the South, where the partisan transformation of the last half-century has been most pronounced. Southern whites, especially in rural areas and small towns, had been Democrats back to the era of Andrew Jackson. The 11 states that once seceded, and the states that border them, were the bedrock base for Democrats in the Electoral College and in both chambers of Congress for nearly all the nation's first 200 years. That powerful pattern had begun to change before Roe. Some Southern states had voted for Republican presidential candidates as far back as 1928 (when Democrats first nominated a Catholic, Al Smith). But more a more permanent shift began in the 1960s, after passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and it gained momentum in the era after Roe. Many Southern whites regarded both that 1964 act and that 1973 decision as attacks on states' rights. And much of the political history of the past half century in the U.S. has been about Republicans taking up this cause. This dynamic motivated many an officeholder to switch parties in the region. It also drove Nixon's Southern Strategy in 1968 and Ronald Reagan's version of it in the 1980s. Most of the second President Bush's votes in the Electoral College came from former \"slave states,\" as did roughly two-thirds of Trump's in 2020. This long trend at the presidential level was briefly interrupted by the election of  Carter (Georgia) in 1976 and Clinton (Arkansas) in the 1990s. But even in the Clinton years, the South was becoming more Republican than at any time since Reconstruction. Election Day in 1994 saw Republicans gain their first majority in all those offices in the South since Reconstruction. That Dixie realignment has held ever since and been mirrored by similar Republican takeovers in state legislatures and at the local level.",

            "article_content": "These midterms, younger voters have soured on the Democratic Party. Party leaders see the threat to abortion rights as an opportunity to rebuild the multigenerational coalition that elected Joe Biden.  ADRIAN FLORIDO, HOST: A broad, multigenerational coalition of voters powered Democratic victories in the 2018 midterms and the 2020 presidential election. But with six months to go until this year's midterms, younger voters have soured on Democrats. Some party leaders hope that the prospect of a Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade could re-energize them. NPR's Juana Summers reports. JUANA SUMMERS, BYLINE: After a draft opinion suggested that the Supreme Court could overturn Roe v. Wade, President Biden and other Democrats called on voters to elect pro-abortion rights elected officials in November. For Arekia Bennett-Scott, those words fell flat. AREKIA BENNETT-SCOTT: It didn't feel like an urgency for the White House, a fight that they want to, like, get out in front of. SUMMERS: Bennett-Scott is the executive director of Mississippi Votes, a youth advocacy group. Her state's only abortion provider is at the center of the case that could strike down the landmark law. BENNETT-SCOTT: The rest of the country is going to wake up in Mississippi the day Roe v. Wade is overturned. SUMMERS: Democrats are hoping the news will give them momentum in the fight for control of Congress, where the party is defending slim majorities. And Biden is facing diminished enthusiasm among a number of key groups, including the young voters he overwhelmingly won in 2020. Polling shows that most young people oppose completely overturning Roe v. Wade. This is Laphonza Butler, the head of Emily's List. LAPHONZA BUTLER: We have got to, in my opinion, connect these generations so that the experiences of pre-Roe v. Wade can be made much more clear and tangible to young voters, you know, who haven't lived a time without Roe v. Wade being the law of the land. NICOLE HENSEL: While young people today may not have technically lived without Roe on the books, that doesn't mean that young people don't know what it feels like to live without access to abortion. SUMMERS: That's Nicole Hensel. She's the executive director of New Era Colorado. HENSEL: This fight is about power. It's about control and the ability to control other people's bodies. And that is something that young people are very fearful of and also energized to resist. SUMMERS: But she also said that while the prospect of the Supreme Court striking down Roe is launching young people to action, that action doesn't always equal voting. It could mean things like protesting, having conversations with family members or people in their communities, getting involved at the local level. HENSEL: If we want young people to mobilize for the midterms, then politicians can't pay lip service to these issues. They need to show that they're willing to take bold action. SUMMERS: Hensel said she wants to see the Senate vote to codify abortion rights into law, something the Senate plans to hold a vote on next week. The legislation does not have the support to be enacted. MELISSA STIEHLER: There's a lot of anger and distrust in political institutions right now, but we know that we can't cede that ground. SUMMERS: That's Melissa Stiehler, the advocacy director for Loud Light, a Kansas-based organization focused on engaging young people. In Kansas, the right to an abortion is currently protected by the state's constitution. But that could change in August, when the state's voters have their say on a constitutional amendment. She says young voters are looking for unapologetic leadership. STIEHLER: Every poll shows that the majority of voters do not want Roe overturned, and that is more real than ever. These are not hypothetical things. SUMMERS: And, facing headwinds in the midterms, Democrats will need a message that can mobilize these young voters to the polls in November.

Stacey Abrams, Georgia's Democratic gubernatorial candidate, briefly pivoted her fundraising efforts in light of the leaked Supreme Court draft opinion. On Wednesday she asked her supporters to donate not to her campaign, but to abortion-rights groups working in the state. Abrams \u2014 who helped turn Georgia blue in the 2020 presidential election after narrowly losing her last governor's race in 2018 \u2014 is continuing to solicit donations for the Feminist Women's Health Center, SisterSong, Planned Parenthood Southeast, Access Reproductive Care Southeast and NARAL Pro-Choice Georgia. \"We know that no one individual, campaign or organization can guarantee reproductive choice on their own,\" Abrams' campaign wrote in a fundraising email. \"We can only win this fight by uniting and doing the work together.\" In a tweet later that night, Abrams thanked the more than 187,000 supporters who have invested in her campaign so far and urged them to consider donating to the reproductive freedom organizations as well. Abrams, who is running unopposed in the May 24 Democratic primary, has raised large sums of money for causes as well as her own candidacy. Her campaign announced on Wednesday that it had raised $11.7 million in the three months ending April 30, the Associated Press reports. She said she has more than $8 million cash on hand, a smaller sum than that reported by Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, who is running for reelection. Kemp raised $2.7 million during this same period, limited by a state law that prohibits sitting officeholders from accepting contributions while state lawmakers are meeting. As the AP explains, Kemp sought to use a leadership committee \u2014 a state fundraising vehicle that allowed him to collect unlimited contributions and coordinate spending with his campaign. Both Abrams and Kemp's Republican opponent, former U.S. senator David Perdue, sued over the committee on the grounds that it was unfair for him to be able to collect large sums while the two of them were barred from doing so until after their party primaries. The draft opinion is having an impact across the state's May 24 primary races, WABE reporter Sam Gringlas told Morning Edition. Democrats are hoping the issue will energize their voters, while, at the Republican debate for lieutenant governor, candidates were asked if they were satisfied with the state's existing abortion restrictions \u2014 and all said they want to ban the procedure. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution also notes that The Fair Fight Action political organization she founded has raised more than $100 million since 2019. The voting rights organization made several $10,000 contributions to abortion rights groups on Wednesday as well. Abrams told the AJC that her campaign would \"absolutely lean into and lead on that issue.\" \"If I want to be the governor of one Georgia, that means I've got to govern for the women of Georgia,\" she said. \"And the women of Georgia by and large agree that their right to choose should not be stripped away from them.\" This story originally appeared in the Morning Edition live blog.",

(left), and Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill. (next to Schumer), listen during an event on Tuesday about the leaked Supreme Court draft decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. About 30 Senate Democrats marched down the steps of the Capitol on Tuesday to declare their support for abortion rights and shout their solidarity with protesters who gathered just across the Capitol plaza in front of the Supreme Court. It was a typical rally. Democrats blamed Republicans for creating a Supreme Court majority that, according to a draft opinion leaked to Politico, intends to end federal abortion-rights protections by overturning Roe v. Wade. They spoke of a generation of women who will likely have fewer reproductive rights than their mothers, and they made promises to hold every Senator accountable. Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Dick Durbin, D-Ill., was declaring that the way to protect abortion rights was to elect more Democrats to Congress in November. Then, someone in the mostly quiet crowd shouted, \"Do something!\" Democrats are getting used to this kind of moment, part of a well-trod cycle. Their base has a demand. Democrats agree with the demand. Democrats promise action. Democrats don't have the votes in Congress to make good on that promise. Since President Biden took office in January 2021, less than two years ago, this story has repeated several times with voting rights, police reform, climate change and spending on the social safety net. Now, it's abortion rights. And some voters and activists are getting tired. Renee Bracey Sherman of the abortion-rights group We Testify was at the Supreme Court on Tuesday. She said she needed lawmakers to talk about what they're actually going to do to protect abortion rights. \"We asked for the president of the United States to come out and speak to all of us and talk about the abortion crisis and give us a plan of what he is going to do,\" Bracey Sherman said. \"Until he does that and actually acts on that plan, it is not enough.\" She said that was true for all politicians who say they support abortion rights. Other activists are venting similar frustrations. \"Time and time again, we have seen Democrats use abortion rights as a campaign issue and fail to deliver on their promises to protect and expand our right to reproductive freedom,\" said Analilia Mejia, co-executive director of the Center for Popular Democracy. \"We deserve leadership that represents the vast majority of Americans who believe abortion should be accessible and affordable to all who require this critical health care.\" Sen.

Wade.\n                \n                    \n                    Alex Wong/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., speaks during a rally in front of the Supreme Court on Tuesday in response to the leaked Supreme Court draft decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. Their calls range from abolishing the filibuster and passing federal abortion protections to expanding the Supreme Court to allow Democrats to appoint new justices and shift the balance of power to the political left. But there's little that Democrats can do right now to address any of it. Polls have consistently shown that a majority of Americans support the right to an abortion. A recent NPR/Marist poll found that voters feel Democrats would do a better job on the issue of abortion by an 11 percentage-point margin. The number of congressional Democrats opposing abortion rights has dwindled to a mere handful in recent years. But this massive support is not enough to overcome the same political divisions that have prevented Democrats from passing most other party priorities. Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill., speaks on Tuesday at a news conference about the leaked Supreme Court draft decision to overturn Roe v. Wade.\n                \n                    \n                    Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill., speaks on Tuesday at a news conference about the leaked Supreme Court draft decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. Senate Democrats do not have the option of circumventing the filibuster to pass federal abortion protections. This means they would need either 60 votes to pass a bill or unanimous agreement among their members to overturn the filibuster. That agreement remains out of reach, with Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., telling reporters on Tuesday that he still supports the filibuster. \"The filibuster is the only protection we have of democracy right now,\" Manchin said. \"The bottom line is we need checks and balances.\" Democrats have been very clear about their limitations, particularly in the Senate. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., promised to hold a vote to \"codify the right to an abortion in law.\" But he was careful not to promise that it would pass. \"A vote on this legislation is not an abstract exercise. This is as urgent and real as it gets,\" Schumer said on the Senate floor. \"We will vote to protect a women's right to choose, and every American is going to see which side every senator stands.\" Other Democrats have been equally clear about their expectations. When asked about what the Senate can do in response to the draft opinion, Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, pointed to ethics reforms that Congress could pass and changes that could increase transparency about the outside political support that justices may receive. Sen.

Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, speaks during an event on Tuesday about the leaked Supreme Court draft decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. But pressed about what this Congress can do in the near term to specifically address abortion, Hirono pointed to Democrats' limitations. \"You mean the Senate, because the House already passed a bill,\" Hirono said. \"You'd have to get rid of a filibuster in the Senate.\" Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., told reporters that Congress needs to vote and keep voting to force lawmakers to make their positions public. \"Congress is the last hope for millions of people across this country whose lives and well-being have been put at risk by a United States Supreme Court that is out at the far fringe of America,\" she said. \"Everyone needs to be on the record about where they stand.\" None of that fulfills the activists' calls for immediate remedy. But Democrats hope it will be enough to get voters like Robin Galbraith to the polls in November. Galbraith, a mother of two adult children who lives in Maryland, told NPR the draft decision is a wake-up call for Democrats who may have been planning to sit out the upcoming election. \"I am dedicated to getting out the vote until November,\" she said. \"It has woken a volcano in me. I mean, I'm just livid.\" Danielle Kurtzleben and Barbara Sprunt contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "If the U.S. Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade, the right to an abortion in purple states, like Pennsylvania, might largely depend on which party can keep or take control of state government.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: In Pennsylvania, Governor Tom Wolf, a Democrat, is term limited. And like some other purple states, the race for governor looks neck-and-neck between Democrats and Republicans. Part of voters' consideration will be this week's leaked draft decision from the Supreme Court on abortion access. From member station WITF, Sam Dunklau reports. SAM DUNKLAU, BYLINE: If the U.S. Supreme Court does decide to overturn Roe v. Wade, Pennsylvanians could still access abortion but with some caveats. Even with Roe, those caveats have been in place for decades, as state House Republican spokesman Jason Gottesman explains. JASON GOTTESMAN: Pennsylvania right now has the Abortion Control Act, and that would be unaffected because it would then be left up to the states to decide. And we already have that law on the books. DUNKLAU: Pregnant women have to consult with a doctor at least 24 hours before an abortion, and abortions after 24 weeks are only allowed if they're needed because of a sexual assault, incest or to protect a pregnant person's life. And though Republicans who control the state legislature have recently pushed bills restricting abortion further, Democratic Governor Tom Wolf has held the line by vetoing them all. But Wolf is being term limited out of his job this year, and eight Republicans are scrambling for their party's blessing to run for it in this month's primary. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LOU BARLETTA: I would sign any bill that comes to my desk that would protect the life of the unborn. DUNKLAU: Some candidates for governor, like former Congressman Lou Barletta, have said in TV debates that they would keep Pennsylvania's law in place. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BARLETTA: And I have made exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother. DUNKLAU: But others, like state Senator Doug Mastriano, say they would not make exceptions. Mastriano says he'd push lawmakers to ban abortion after six weeks of pregnancy. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DOUG MASTRIANO: This is a national catastrophe. And so we're going to move with alacrity, with speed on the heartbeat bill, and we're going to get it down. DUNKLAU: State Attorney General Josh Shapiro, the only Democrat that's running, says he and Wolf are of one mind on bills like that. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JOSH SHAPIRO: I will veto that bill and protect the fundamental freedoms of women here in the commonwealth of Pennsylvania. DUNKLAU: The Cook Political Report rates the Pennsylvania governor's race as a toss-up, and the idea that anyone could win is what has some voters worried about what would happen if the Roe decision is tossed out. Alyssa McLaughlin, who volunteers for Planned Parenthood, demonstrated on the state capitol steps with that in mind. ALYSSA MCLAUGHLIN: Voting in this midterm election is really - especially with Governor Wolf leaving, I think that it's really going to make a difference as to whether or not abortion access continues in the state of Pennsylvania or not. DUNKLAU: In a recent statewide poll, 53% of Pennsylvania voters said abortion should remain legal in certain circumstances. Valerie Boland also showed up at the capitol steps and says she'd rather see the practice banned entirely. She volunteers for Doug Mastriano, one of the Republican candidates. VALERIE BOLAND: If our government would stop funding abortion and start funding adoption, we could have adoption. These babies could be put up for adoption to loving families. When there's abortion, there's no chance. Like, you can't change that. DUNKLAU: Another protester, social worker Beth Diltz, says abortion should be legal in all cases because there are downsides to alternatives, like adoption. BETH DILTZ: I think a lot of people forget that the foster care system doesn't have the capacity to care for these children. There's not enough funding. There's not access. DUNKLAU: Pennsylvania's primary is less than two weeks away, and a poll last month shows two-thirds of Republican voters haven't picked a candidate. But if the GOP takes the governor's mansion in November, depending on who that is, access to abortion could look very different in Pennsylvania. For NPR News, I'm Sam Dunklau in Harrisburg.

The GOP became a political vehicle for the movement, as a more vocal Christian Right began to rise.  ADRIAN FLORIDO, HOST: Overturning Roe v. Wade has been arguably the single most animating cause among conservatives in America for decades. Now a leaked draft Supreme Court opinion has made it apparent that goal is close to reality. NPR's Deepa Shivaram reports on how the issue of abortion came to define Republican politics. DEEPA SHIVARAM, BYLINE: Abortion wasn't always as politically charged as it is today. Even after the Supreme Court ruled on Roe v. Wade in 1973, there were Democratic and Republican candidates against abortion for a long time, in part to appeal to Catholic voters. Then in 1976, Republicans adopted an anti-abortion stance in their party platform, and the GOP became this political vehicle for the movement as a more vocal Christian right started to rise. Here's Ronald Reagan at the March for Life rally in 1988. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) RONALD REAGAN: We're told about a woman's right to control her own body. But doesn't the unborn child have a higher right? And that is to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. SHIVARAM: Leaders like Reagan helped to boost Republicans as a party of, quote, \"family values.\" But over the next two decades, more radical, socially conservative figures started putting more pressure on the party. JENNIFER HOLLAND: Really see the power of the anti-abortion movement to not only be a part of the party, but to really remake a party and demand sort of political uniformity on this issue. SHIVARAM: That's Jennifer Holland. She's a scholar on the anti-abortion movement and a professor at the University of Oklahoma. HOLLAND: They had to convince a whole host of people that this was not only political, but the most important political issue that there is, and that everything came second to opposing abortion. SHIVARAM: She says that movement leaders didn't want elected officials to just believe that abortion was immoral. They wanted them to act on it. Someone who took up that call? Pat Buchanan. Here he is in 1996 during his campaign for president. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PAT BUCHANAN: If I'm nominated, I will choose a pro-life Republican running mate. I will appoint justices who will overturn Roe v. Wade. And I will be the most pro-life president in the history of the United States of America, bar none. SHIVARAM: In the decades since, Republicans have heavily relied on voters who are staunchly opposed to abortion rights, like white evangelical Christians. It's partly how Donald Trump won the presidency in 2016, with his pledge to appoint anti-abortion rights justices to the court. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DONALD TRUMP: The justices that I am going to appoint - and I've named 20 of them - the justices that I'm going to appoint will be pro-life. They will have a conservative bent. SHIVARAM: At the same time, Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell put the federal judiciary at the top of his agenda, refusing a hearing on President Obama's nominee for a vacant Supreme Court seat until the 2016 election was finished, and then in 2020, moving quickly to confirm the third of Trump's Supreme Court picks before the election. Those justices appear set to provide the votes to overturn Roe in the coming weeks. But even if they get this victory, the anti-abortion movement's ultimate goal is to implement a nationwide ban on abortions. They've gotten one step closer to that with this draft opinion from the Supreme Court, but politically, it could have some consequences. Here's Paul Djupe, a professor of religion and politics at Denison University. PAUL DJUPE: The tension that Roe v. Wade has created for them was really beneficial. So once that tension is released and states are allowed to do it, they lose the ability to mobilize based on abortion tensions with the federal government. SHIVARAM: Plus, it could be politically difficult for Republicans to go further on curtailing abortion rights. Nationally, public opinion shows a majority of Americans don't support a full ban on abortion. Deepa Shivaram, NPR News, Washington. Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Vance arrives onstage in Cincinnati after winning the primary Tuesday night. Republican candidates backed by former President Donald Trump had a good night in Ohio and Indiana primaries Tuesday night. Many of these candidates are younger and likely to make it to Congress \u2014 and if more of them win elsewhere this year, this cycle could represent something of a bridge to Trumpism, even post-Trump. They are examples of the potentially lasting effects of how Trump has changed GOP politics \u2014 although there are limits to his influence. Pro-Trump candidates continued to do best in rural areas, underscoring where his power is concentrated, but there remains a question of how well Trumpism can do in swing areas. In the more short term \u2014 and something worth tracking \u2014 there was an indication that Republican enthusiasm is up, while Democrats' is down. That's evident in how much GOP turnout rose, compared with the 2018 primaries. That's one early warning sign for President Biden and his party in the president's first midterm, when parties out of power historically do well. Biden's stature within the party, though, got a small boost when an Ohio candidate he endorsed won in a landslide over a progressive firebrand who lost only narrowly last year. Vance, the Hillbilly Elegy author, won a crowded Ohio Republican Senate primary in the race to replace retiring Sen. Rob Portman. Vance, who got a boost after Trump endorsed him, defeated former state Treasurer Josh Mandel by about 8 points. Vance had been much further down in the polls before Trump's endorsement, and he knew exactly who to thank Tuesday night. \"Thanks to the president for everything, for endorsing me,\" said Vance, 37, who in 2016 called himself a \"Never Trump guy\" and said he \"never liked him.\" He's changed his tune. \"A lot of fake news media out there,\" Vance said, continuing, \"wanted to write the story that this campaign would be the death of Donald Trump's 'America First' agenda. Ladies and gentlemen, it ain't the death of the 'America First' agenda.\" Trump also feuded with \u2014 and defeated \u2014 a powerful pro-GOP outside group, the Club for Growth, in this race. The club, which has often aligned with the former president, continued to support Mandel after Trump endorsed Vance. That drew Trump's ire and, at one point, Trump reportedly sent the head of the group a text cursing him out. Ryan easily won the Democratic nomination. Vance, who accused Ryan Tuesday night of running as a \"Trump Democrat,\" starts as the favorite in a state that has trended more Republican. Democrats hope Ryan can make inroads with a working class-focused message, but the politics of this state are clear \u2014 so much so that when Ryan was asked if he wants Biden to campaign with him, he said he's running his own race. - Ohio's 7th Congressional District Max Miller, a former Trump White House staffer, won the primary in Ohio's 7th district. Miller is all but assured of becoming a congressman because of the conservative bent of the district. Miller, 33, was initially running this cycle against Republican Rep. Anthony Gonzalez, who voted for Trump's impeachment. But Gonzalez retired instead of face the Trump onslaught. After redistricting, Miller wound up running in a different district held by GOP Rep. Bob Gibbs. But Gibbs retired, clearing the path for Miller. Former President Donald Trump listens as Max Miller, Republican nominee for Ohio's 7th Congressional District, speaks during a rally on April 23 in Delaware, Ohio.\n                \n                    \n                    Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Miller is a controversial figure. He's been accused of physical abuse by ex-girlfriend Stephanie Grisham, another former White House aide. Miller denies the allegations and has sued Grisham for libel and defamation. Grisham's book also described Miller as Trump's \"Music Man,\" playing Trump show tunes, like Memories from Cats, to calm the then-president down. \"We will protect life, finish the wall, fund our police, support our military, fight for fair trade deals, and stop the Biden Administration's insane runaway spending,\" Miller said in a statement after his win, parroting the Trump \"America First\" agenda. \"We will stand up for our country and our citizens, and we will ensure America is respected once again.\" - Ohio's 9th Congressional District In a key seat that Republicans are hoping to flip this fall, a man who twice painted a 19,000-square foot Trump banner on his lawn, J.R. Majewski, will be taking on longtime Democratic Rep. Marcy Kaptur in Ohio's 9th district. Kaptur is facing one of the most difficult elections of her career this year, after redistricting significantly changed the district's composition. Majewski is a newcomer to politics and ran on a message reviving \"Trump's America.\" \"It's time to make America dominant again,\" Majewski, 42, says in one of his ads, showing the phrase \u2014 mimicking Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" slogan \u2014 painted onto the side of an 18-wheeler truck. - Indiana's 1st Congressional District In Indiana's 1st district, another pro-Trump candidate who cuts an interesting profile won in a Democratic-held seat that is expected to be competitive this fall. Jennifer-Ruth Green, a former Iraq veteran and Air Force pilot who won the GOP nod by 25 points, ran her entire campaign bashing her main opponent for not supporting Trump in 2016. Green, who is Black, ran ads saying she would advance Trump's \"America First\" policies and on a platform that's anti-abortion rights and for keeping transgender girls out of girls sports. She would be the only Black woman Republican member of Congress if she beats freshman Democratic Rep. Frank Mrvan. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine won the GOP nomination again. He faced a challenge from three more Trump-aligned candidates, who were critical of DeWine's management of the coronavirus pandemic. But DeWine, who had the power of incumbency on his side, beat back former Rep. Jim Renacci by 20 points. Trump didn't endorse in this race, though Renacci tried. He even hired troubled ex-Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale to run his race. In the secretary of state's race, Trump surprisingly endorsed the man who won, incumbent Frank LaRose over a challenger who lined up far more strongly with Trump in pushing his election lies about election fraud that wasn't. LaRose previously defended U.S. elections, saying in 2020 it was \"irresponsible\" for anyone to \"fearmonger about elections administration.\" But he has since softened his stance, telling NPR that he believes there were \"shenanigans\" in other states. So candidates who don't fully embrace Trumpism can win, especially if they have money and an established political brand. And while Trump's endorsement catapulted Vance in a crowded Senate field, Vance only won about a third of the vote \u2014 though several other candidates were pro-Trump as well. That's been one of the stories of the Trump era, even for Trump himself. He was rarely the majority choice when he ran in the GOP primary for president in 2016, but Republicans were never able to coalesce around an alternative. And it's clear, right now, Trump is and will be an important factor in these elections.",

            "article_content": "What the overturning of Roe v. Wade could mean for U.S. politics. The field is set for Ohio's U.S. Senate race in November. Some civilians and Ukrainian soldiers are still trapped in a steel plant.  LEILA FADEL, HOST: Protesters are marching across the United States after a leak suggests the Supreme Court plans to reverse the constitutional right to abortion for the first time in half a century. A MART\u00cdNEZ, HOST: President Biden says that this decision, if it holds, would be a radical change that could impact a whole range of private matters. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Does this mean that in Florida, they can decide they're going to pass a law saying that same-sex marriage is not permissible? It's against the law in Florida? FADEL: For more on what overturning Roe v. Wade could mean for American politics, we're joined by NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson. Hi, Mara. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Hi there. FADEL: So, Mara, President Biden and other Democratic leaders are vowing to make abortion rights a central issue in the midterm elections this fall. So what's their plan? And will this bring more Democrats to the ballot box? LIASSON: That's the big question. Their solution is to try to motivate voters to elect more Democrats. We don't know yet if abortion rights are going to be more motivating for Democratic voters than issues like immigration, inflation and crime are for Republicans and independent voters. In the past, abortion rights has always been a bigger motivator for conservatives than for liberals. The question now is, is this potential ruling a tipping point? In the short term, in Washington, there's not a lot Democrats can do to secure abortion rights. Nationally, they don't have the votes to pass something in the Senate that would codify Roe. Even though Republican Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski would presumably support that, there aren't enough votes to break the filibuster. FADEL: Now, just yesterday, Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt signed a ban on most abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy, modeled after a similar Texas law. If the Supreme Court overturns Roe, it would leave abortion decisions up to the states. So let's talk about other restrictions we could see. LIASSON: I think that you will see more legislating in conservative states. Some legislators have talked about criminalizing abortion, making it a crime to take a woman across state lines to get an abortion. Some activists on the right have talked about passing national abortion restrictions if Republicans gain control of Congress. But other conservatives are cautious and are waiting for the court to rule. FADEL: Now, clearly, Republicans and Democrats are reacting very differently to this news. Could you break that down for us? LIASSON: Yes. On the Democratic side, President Biden, as you heard him in that clip, are warning that the rationale behind this opinion can be used to roll back other rights that are enshrined by the courts that rely on a constitutional right to privacy, like contraception or same-sex marriage. Republicans, on the other hand, have been - at least in Washington, have been very focused on the leak, not the policy. The National Republican Senatorial Committee issued a memo to its members that was very defensive and encouraged them to be the compassionate consensus-builders on abortion policies and to stress that Republicans do not want to take away contraception or to put doctors or women in jail. It was almost as if they were very aware of public opinion on this and the fact that they haven't won the battle for hearts and minds because polls have consistently shown that public opinion is solidly behind upholding Roe. More than 50% support it, and less than 30% support overturning it. FADEL: So if the court goes through with this decision, what does it mean for U.S. politics in the long run? LIASSON: Well, we don't know that, but we do know that it's going to spark this bigger debate that we've been having about whether the United States is turning into a minority-rule country. A majority of the justices on the court were appointed by presidents who didn't get a majority of the popular vote, and in some cases, the conservative justices were confirmed by senators representing a minority of voters. FADEL: OK. LIASSON: So I think you're going to hear a lot of talk about that, whether the structure of the Senate and the Electoral College and extreme gerrymandering is leading to minority rule in this country. And we'll find out if voters are comfortable with that. FADEL: NPR's Mara Liasson. Thanks, Mara. LIASSON: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) FADEL: Ohio's Senate race is shaping up to be one of the most closely watched elections in the country, as Democrats are hoping to drive more people to the polls. MART\u00cdNEZ: Yeah, Ohio Congressman Tim Ryan won the state's Democratic U.S. Senate primary, setting up a battle against Republican nominee J.D. Vance, who was endorsed by former President Donald Trump. Here he is addressing supporters after his victory. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) J D VANCE: They wanted to write a story that this campaign would be the death of Donald Trump's America-first agenda. Ladies and gentlemen, it ain't the death of the America-first agenda. (CHEERING) MART\u00cdNEZ: This is already the most expensive race in Ohio's history. FADEL: With us now is NPR's national political correspondent Don Gonyea in Cincinnati, where he's been covering the race. Good morning. DON GONYEA, BYLINE: Good morning. FADEL: So, Don, how did J.D. Vance emerge on top of a crowded field of Republican candidates, each vying to be more pro-Trump than the other? GONYEA: Yeah, the GOP primary was just a slugfest, a race full of personal attacks. But you have to give credit to the fact that Vance ultimately got that Trump endorsement. It's something that seemed unlikely early on, given Vance's very strong criticisms of Trump back in 2016. But he became a major fan of Trump's over the years. And by the time he entered this race, he was really all in, and Trump gave him his blessing. Here's Vance with supporters last night. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) VANCE: I have absolutely got to thank the 45th, the president of the United States, Donald J. Trump, ladies and gentlemen. (CHEERING) VANCE: One forgiveness example of what could be in this country, ladies and gentlemen. Remember 2019, when wages were going up and not down? Remember 2019, when workers were doing well in this country, not struggling terribly? Thanks to the president for everything. GONYEA: So look for Trump to be very much front and center in the fall campaign. FADEL: OK, so let's talk about the Democrats. What's next for Tim Ryan? He's seen as a moderate congressman. GONYEA: Ryan has essentially been running his general election race for many months now. He boasts of going to all 88 counties, including the deepest red, most hardcore Trump counties, in the state. He says he wants to listen to everybody, but he also wants people to see him and hear him, and he talks about bringing Ohio back as a leader in manufacturing. Again, the economy took up a chunk of his victory speech last night. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TIM RYAN: I want us to be builders again. I want us to dominate the electric car industry. I want us to dominate the battery industry. I want us to dominate the electric truck industry. I want us to dominate the chip industry, glass industry, energy in southeast Ohio, aerospace in southwest Ohio. I want us to be the manufacturing powerhouse of the world. FADEL: Now, Ohio was previously a major swing state and a bellwether for the presidential pick, but it's made a shift to the right, and Trump easily won the state in 2016 and 2020. What does that mean for this race? GONYEA: It means it's something Ryan has to overcome. Again, Trump won the state big twice. And this, you know, economic uncertainty we're looking at now doesn't help Ryan at all. Vance last night accused him of trying to be a Trump Democrat. He's got a lot to overcome. But people do expect it to be a race. FADEL: NPR's Don Gonyea. Thanks, Don. GONYEA: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) FADEL: The U.S. has already banned oil imports from Russia. Now Europe is thinking about doing the same. The European Union proposed today a plan to phase out Russian crude oil. It's an attempt to put economic pressure on Russia, which continues to attack Ukraine as far west as Lviv, near the Polish border. MART\u00cdNEZ: And Russian shelling continues in the port city of Mariupol. Ukrainian officials are hoping to get more people out of the ruins of the Azovstal steel plant in the city. Hundreds of civilians and Ukrainian fighters are still holed up in bunkers and tunnels underneath the plant. The soldiers are the last holdouts in a city Russian forces have reduced to rubble. Roughly a hundred evacuees have now arrived in the city of Zaporizhzhia. FADEL: And that's where NPR's Joanna Kakissis is. Hi, Joanna. JOANNA KAKISSIS, BYLINE: Hi, Leila. FADEL: So, Joanna, you're in Zaporizhzhia. You watched evacuees arrive after weeks of living under bombardment, living underground. How are they? KAKISSIS: Yeah, the people who were inside that plant walked off those buses looking very pale, looking totally exhausted. I remember this little boy with curly brown hair and freckles. His name is Vova (ph). I was with his friend Sasha (ph), who was waiting for him. They'd grown up together in Mariupol, and Sasha said Vova, you know, was so much fun and had so much energy. But, you know, when he saw Vova, you know, get off that bus looking so exhausted and so sad, you know, Sasha just started crying. He ran to Vova, and he hugged them, and he said, it's going to be OK. Vova and the others were evacuated by the U.N. and the Red Cross. It was a very tricky evacuation. It involved a cease-fire that only held for a couple of days and lots of checkpoints. The U.N. said that some people chose to stay behind in Mariupol after getting out of the plant. They wanted to try to find their family members and even though the U.N. warned them that this would be very, very dangerous. FADEL: Now, the U.N. humanitarian coordinator who helped get them out says for many, it was their first chance to, quote, \"see daylight\" after two months. I just can't imagine that. What did people tell you it was like? KAKISSIS: Yeah, it was extremely bad. People told me it was like living through a horror movie or the apocalypse. You know, aside from food and water shortages and shortages of things like medicine and hygienic products, you know, there's the bombing and the shelling. Everyone I spoke to, they talked about entire rooms shaking and bricks coming loose and falling on families huddled together. I spoke with Anna Krilova and her 14-year-old daughter Maya, who - they lived through all this, and Anna gave this description. ANNA KRILOVA: (Through interpreter) It was really scary because we couldn't go outside. It was just too dangerous. And inside, we kept going from shelter to shelter because the bombs kept hitting. We were hungry. We were scared. We were under constant shelling. FADEL: So it feels strange to say this after listening to that, but these are the lucky ones. These are the ones that got out. Humanitarian corridors in the past fell apart under bombardment, and there are still people stuck under that plant. How confident are Ukrainian officials and the U.N. that they can get them out? KAKISSIS: Yeah, so Ukrainian officials say they are going to push really hard to get everyone out. They're going to do everything they can. And the U.N. says they're already planning a mission to do so. But again, you know, this is very, very complicated. Russians are - once - the Russian troops are once again hitting the plant really, really hard. And so Russia doesn't appear to be showing any signs of a spirit of a cease-fire here. FADEL: NPR's Joanna Kakissis in Zaporizhzhia. Thank you, Joanna. KAKISSIS: You're welcome, Leila. Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Vice President Harris on Tuesday blasted a leaked draft that indicated that the Supreme Court had voted to overturn the landmark abortion rights decision Roe v. Wade, declaring that \"women's rights in America are under attack.\" \"If the court overturns Roe v. Wade it will be a direct assault on freedom \u2014 on the fundamental right of self-determination to which all Americans are entitled,\" she said. Harris had been scheduled to speak at the national conference and gala for EMILY's List long before Politico published the Supreme Court draft opinion signaling that the court's conservative majority is poised to overturn Roe v. Wade. EMILY's List is a Democratic group dedicated to backing women candidates who are pro-abortion rights. She warned that if the justices follow through with this ruling, it could further extend to other privacy rights including same-sex marriage. \"When the right to privacy is attacked, anyone in our country may face a future where the government can interfere with their personal decisions,\" said Harris. \"Not just women. Anyone. And it has never been more clear which party wants to expand our rights and which party wants to restrict them. \" While the court has cautioned that no decision was final, the leaked draft opinion reverberated across the country, at the same moment as the 2022 midterm primary season is beginning in earnest. Harris called on supporters of abortion rights to elect more candidates who share their values. \"We have been on the front lines of this fight for many years. All of us in this together. And now we enter a new phase,\" Harris said. \"There is nothing hypothetical about this moment.\" Advocates and supporters of voting rights who gathered at the event, held at a Washington D.C. hotel, described the idea that the court may be on the precipice of ending the constitutional right to an abortion as a seismic shift. \"I think it's really important not to glaze over this moment. It is devastating,  and we do have to sit with that\" said Jacqueline Ayers, the senior vice president of policy, organizing, and campaigns for Planned Parenthood for America. Earlier Tuesday, EMILY's List President Laphonza Butler described the contents of the draft opinion as an \"unprecedented attack on our fundamental freedoms,\" but suggested that the possibility of abortion becoming illegal in dozens of states could well mobilize voters ahead of the 2022 midterms. Democrats are defending narrow majorities in Congress, and historical trends show that the party that controls the White House typically loses seats in the first congressional elections of a president's term. Butler pointed to polling that has consistently shown that a majority of Americans support legal abortion, though with complex views on the matter. \"Voters have struggled with a believability gap, with majorities noting that they did not believe Roe was truly at risk. Now that the Supreme Court's pending decision to overturn Roe all together has leaked, we believe voters are galvanized to take action,\" said Butler. Butler said that data from her organization shows that \"Republicans taking away the right to abortion is extremely motivating to both persuasion and mobilization targets,\" and that \"undermining Roe and Republican attacks on abortion rights drives Democratic enthusiasm.\" EMILY's List, Planned Parenthood Action Fund and NARAL Pro-Choice America announced this week that they plan to collectively spend $150 million on the 2022 midterms, on races up and down the ballot. The states that the groups are targeting include Georgia, Nevada, Arizona, Michigan, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, California, Kansas and Wisconsin. Ayers, of Planned Parenthood, said that the leaked draft opinion shows that Republicans intend to \"roll back the clock\" on rights \u2014 extending far beyond just abortion. \"They're going after everything. It's not just abortion, it's birth control access, it's marriage equality. This is just really the beginning,\" she said.",

            "article_content": "Political primary season is beginning in earnest, as voters head to the polls in Ohio and Indiana. The marquee races are in Ohio, led by that state's open U.S. Senate seat.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: Primary election season began in earnest today as voters went to the polls in Ohio and Indiana. Among the early results, Congressman Tim Ryan is the Democratic Senate nominee according to a race call from the Associated Press. NPR national political correspondent Don Gonyea is in Ohio and joins us with more. Hey, Don. DON GONYEA, BYLINE: Hey. SHAPIRO: Let's start with that Democratic Senate primary result. Tell us more. GONYEA: Right. Congressman Ryan was expected to win. He was by far the highest-profile candidate. He's been running all along like he was running a general election, and he's really trying to follow the example of the state's Democratic senator who is not on the ballot this year; that's Senator Sherrod Brown. Brown keeps winning by focusing on economic issues. I've been with Ryan on the campaign trail, and he has gone all over the state - including to conservative parts, to Trump strongholds - stressing that economic message, often with harsh words for China. Today, though, Ari, he was also talking about abortion some. You know, there is that leaked draft opinion from the Supreme Court that could indicate Roe v. Wade being struck down. Ryan suggested that that could drive Democratic base voters to turn out as well. SHAPIRO: Having now won the primary, did Ryan share any thoughts about the general election looking ahead? GONYEA: I did - he did. And, you know, I asked him early today, before we knew much - voting was still going on - about his potential Republican opponent, still unknown as we speak. TIM RYAN: They all have different versions of crazy, and so we're just going to hone in on that particular candidate and really provide the contrast. GONYEA: And in his reference to crazy, he is talking about how, on the Republican side, there's been a lot of competition to kind of out-Trump one another among those candidates. But no matter the Republican nominee, Ryan faces an uphill fight. Many political watchers think he could maybe be the kind of Democrat who could win in a red state, especially as Republicans lean so hard into Trumpism. But again, this is a state that Trump won twice really easily. SHAPIRO: Well, tell us about those Republicans that he's likely to be going up against. Who is it? GONYEA: Right. I'm here in Cincinnati, in this ballroom where we are waiting to hear at some point this evening from J.D. Vance. He's holding his election night watch party here. People might remember him for his memoir, \"Hillbilly Elegy.\" I'm with Vance because he may emerge out of a competitive Republican Senate primary after he received the endorsement of former President Trump. Trump came to Ohio a couple of weeks ago to stump for Vance and some candidates down ballot. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DONALD TRUMP: He fights like crazy, and he loves Ohio. And he - frankly, he's a great Buckeye. So what I'd like to do is ask J.D. Vance... (CHEERING, APPLAUSE) UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE: (Chanting) J.D. J.D. J.D. TRUMP: ...Come forward. I want to pick somebody that's going to win. GONYEA: Now, you know, a week later, Trump messed up J.D. Vance's name when he was talking about him at another rally, so there's that. But this is really the first major test to the power of the Trump endorsement this primary season. If Vance wins, Trump will claim credit. If he loses, well, that's a big story, and the questions of Trump's clout become a very hot topic, even among Republicans. SHAPIRO: All right. Well, if Vance doesn't win, who are the other Republicans that we're looking at tonight? GONYEA: Right. There were several of them who wanted Trump's endorsement. There's Josh Mandel, a former state treasurer. It's actually his third Senate run. He's really campaigned in the combative Trump mold. There's Mike Gibbons, an investment banker who's poured a lot of his own money into the bank. One candidate who has not sought Trump's approval and is worth watching is State Senator Matt Dolen. He's a Trump voter, but he's the only one who says the election in 2020 was not stolen. He doesn't buy Trump's lies along those lines, and he hopes he's maybe found a lane for himself.

            "article_content": "Across the U.S., abortion-rights supporters are amassing resources and planning next steps following the draft Supreme Court decision. More than 20 states have passed or are set to pass abortion bans.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: We now know that a leaked draft of a Supreme Court opinion overturning Roe v. Wade is authentic. Chief Justice Roberts confirmed that today after Politico published the document. He noted that it's not a final opinion, but if it holds, it would allow states to prohibit abortion. NPR correspondent Sarah McCammon covers reproductive rights and joins us again. Hi, Sarah. SARAH MCCAMMON, BYLINE: Hi, Ari. SHAPIRO: As we said, this opinion is a draft, but it does give us a window into what the justices are thinking. Tell us about what you've learned so far. MCCAMMON: Right. I mean, it appears to confirm months of predictions from legal experts and others really across the political spectrum that the court was poised to seriously roll back abortion rights, if not overturn Roe v. Wade altogether. Just by agreeing to take this case, the justices appeared to signal that. It is a challenge to a Mississippi law that bans abortion after 15 weeks, so before viability. Chief Justice John Roberts is thought to favor a more incremental approach to change. He asked some questions last fall during the oral arguments that suggested he might have been looking for a way to uphold the Mississippi law without entirely overturning Roe. But Michele Bratcher Goodwin, a law professor at the University of California, Irvine, says the draft opinion would overturn Roe in one fell swoop. MICHELE BRATCHER GOODWIN: It is an opinion that dismantles Roe full-scale, not the dismantling by a thousand strikes. It is a very strong punch to the gut of that opinion. MCCAMMON: And as a result, according to some estimates, about half of states may be poised to ban abortion under such a decision. SHAPIRO: And so as the news sinks in today, what are advocates on both sides telling you? MCCAMMON: Well, abortion-rights opponents are pleased, as you might expect, and hoping that this sticks. This is what they've been working toward at every level of government for decades. Steve Aden with Americans United for Life says his group is asking states to actually come back and call special sessions to pass legislation banning abortion in response to this decision. STEVE ADEN: If this opinion holds, it means that the question of abortion has been returned to where it belongs, to the states and the people, and that will result in a vigorous political debate in a place where it belongs - in the state houses. MCCAMMON: Now, abortion-rights advocates say this will be disastrous for low-income people, people of color and others who are disproportionately affected by abortion restrictions. And they're warning that overturning long-standing precedent could have ramifications for other rights that are protected under Supreme Court decisions such as a right to contraception, same-sex marriage. And that's a worry that we heard President Biden raise today. SHAPIRO: So what is the next move for abortion-rights advocates? MCCAMMON: Well, polls suggest that a majority of Americans want Roe to remain in effect and support abortion rights in most cases. So advocates are hoping this will galvanize voters to turn out for the midterm elections. Fatima Goss Graves is with National Women's Law Center. FATIMA GOSS GRAVES: We have been warning for decades about what is happening in this country in terms of abortion access and the attack on Roe. I think this draft opinion leaked last night is making it real for people. MCCAMMON: Naral Pro-Choice America and other groups, Ari, are investing $150 million on the midterms, focusing on battleground states. And even as many states have rushed to pass restrictions on abortion, what we're also seeing some taking steps to expand abortion access. But increasingly, the way the country seems to be going is toward a very patchwork set of abortion policies. SHAPIRO: NPR's Sarah McCammon, thank you very much. MCCAMMON: Thank you.

The leaked draft opinion from the U.S. Supreme Court, first reported by Politico, in which a majority of justices voted to overturn the landmark Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion rights rocked Capitol Hill on Tuesday. But as Democrats argued the news amounted to a reshaping of fundamental individual rights and reframed the midterm elections, Republicans largely focused on the fact the decision was leaked. Most GOP lawmakers sidestepped questions about the impact the possible ruling could have \u2014 both on women's health decisions and on the 2022 political environment. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., called for an investigation into the \"shocking new breach.\" He said if a crime was committed, the Department of Justice \"must pursue it completely.\" He maintained the leak was \"almost certainly in an effort to stir up an inappropriate pressure campaign to sway an outcome.\" The Justice Department declined to comment on the matter when asked by NPR on Tuesday. Chief Justice John Roberts verified the authenticity of the draft opinion and said in a written statement that it was a \"betrayal\" and it did not represent the court's final position. He directed an investigation and said the work of the court would not be impacted. When McConnell was pressed about the impact of the decision for women and for the midterms this fall, he dodged those questions, saying, \"That's not the story for today.\" McConnell pushed back at reporters seeking reaction about the fallout, saying, \"You need \u2014 it seems to me, excuse the lecture \u2014 to concentrate on what the news is today \u2014 not a leaked draft, but the fact that the draft was leaked.\" Missouri GOP Sen. Josh Hawley called on the Supreme Court to release the opinion now that the draft was made public. He echoed McConnell's argument that it was part of a \"pressure campaign.\" He admitted he didn't have any evidence about who was responsible for the unauthorized disclosure, but Hawley, a former Supreme Court clerk, called the episode \"an attack on the integrity and independence of the court.\" Ohio Republican Sen. Rob Portman said he personally is anti-abortion rights so he was not discouraged about the possible direction of the eventual ruling, but he said, \"The court has unfortunately now lost some respect\" after the firestorm. Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., who chairs the Senate Republicans' campaign arm, noted to reporters that he is \"pro-life\" but cautioned to wait to hear what \"the real decision is\" from the court. Pressed on how the issue could impact the midterms, Scott appeared to downplay it, saying while it is an important issue to many people, \"so is inflation, so is crime, so is the border.\" Multiple GOP senators leaving the weekly Senate lunch said the discussion about the bombshell news that changed the debate on Capitol Hill centered on what many called an \"unprecedented\" breach of decorum. Senate Republicans, one after another, emphasized that the decision isn't final yet. When pressed about the prospects of additional restrictions that could come if the GOP regains the majority in one or both chambers of Congress, many refrained from going there. \"You're asking me to speculate and I'm not going to speculate on what might happen. I'm going to wait for the final decision of the court,\" Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, told reporters. South Dakota GOP Sen. Mike Rounds cautioned, \"Let's allow the justices to finish their work.\" Some did weigh in on what the decision could mean for the future debate on abortion in Congress. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., vowed the Senate would vote on a bill to codify the original Roe v. Wade decision. The House of Representatives approved a measure to do that recently, but senators from both parties acknowledged a GOP filibuster meant that an effort in the Senate would fail and largely be a messaging effort. Top Democrats said it was important to force all senators to go on the record on the issue. Hawley noted that abortion is an issue that energizes his party and added that for GOP voters, \"This is a big reason why they vote for Republican senators.\" With the midterm elections roughly six months away, Democrats are highlighting that a GOP majority on Capitol Hill would likely press for new restrictions, including some who want a federal ban on abortions. Rounds, who said he opposed abortion rights, said depending on what the high court decides there may not be a need for new restrictions. He also said he didn't expect that the Senate would act on a nationwide ban. Hawley, for his part, said, \"I think this is an issue for states and voters in the states in the first instance.\" Schumer decried Republicans for \"ducking\" the substance of the high court's decision and spending so much time discussing the leak.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said the Senate will vote to codify the right to abortion into federal law, in response to a leaked draft of a Supreme Court opinion that would overturn Roe v. Wade. \"A vote on this legislation is not an abstract exercise, this is as urgent and real as it gets,\" Schumer said in a floor speech on Tuesday morning, following Politico's Monday night reporting of the draft, which could change before the final version comes out this summer. \"We will vote to protect a woman's right to choose and every American is going to see which side every senator stands.\" Any such vote would be symbolic. Democrats control the Senate but only hold half the seats, and they can't muster the 60-vote supermajority needed to pass the law that Schumer suggested. Some senators, including Bernie Sanders of Vermont, have called to eliminate the filibuster's supermajority rules to pass a law to protect abortion rights with a simple majority vote. Democrats do not have the support from within the party for such a tactical move, as two centrist senators \u2014 Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona and Joe Manchin of West Virginia \u2014 are opposed to changing any filibuster rules without bipartisan support. During his floor speech, Schumer made a plea to Americans to lobby their members of Congress in support of abortion rights. \"To the American people, I say this: the elections this November will have consequences because the rights of 100 million women are now on the ballot. To help fight this court's awful decision, I urge every American to make their voices heard this week and this year,\" he said. Schumer also repeated his accusation that conservative justices \"lied\" to the Senate in the course of their confirmations regarding their views on whether the Roe decision was settled precedent. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has denounced the leak but not commented on substance of the apparent draft decision, which could change before the Supreme Court officially issues its ruling.

Mike DeWine speaks Jan. 21, 2022 in Newark, Ohio. Incumbent Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine has won the Republican nomination in his bid for reelection, according to a call from The Associated Press. He successfully fought off three candidates in a race that became a re-evaluation of his response to the COVID-19 pandemic. DeWine has defended his actions during the pandemic saying he made decisions based on the \"best information\" available. \"It was my responsibility as governor to take the actions that needed to be taken. I think if you looked at how Ohio approached the pandemic and how other states approach the pandemic, I believe that we had a proper balance between public safety and also allowing people to make their livelihoods,\" he said. DeWine's challengers, former Rep. Jim Renacci, Joe Blystone \u2014 a farmer and businessman who said he never even thought about running for public office until DeWine's COVID-19 response \u2014 and former state Rep. Ron Hood all positioned themselves to the right of DeWine and tried to align themselves with former President Donald Trump. Trump never made an endorsement in the race. DeWine's challengers also attempted to attract voters frustrated by the fact that he was the first governor in the country to shut down K-12 schools, that he issued health orders to shut down businesses and that he quickly implemented social distancing requirements. Despite the jabs, DeWine, who has spent more than 40 years in public service as a Republican, defends his conservative record, noting he has signed bills that lift gun regulations and expand abortion restrictions. And on the Democratic side, former Dayton Mayor Nan Whaley won the nomination, according to a call from The Associated Press. Whaley defeated former Cincinnati Mayor John Cranley to become the state's first woman to win a major party's nomination in a gubernatorial primary. Whaley announced her candidacy in the race more than a year ago. She also ran for the Democratic nomination in 2018 but bowed out before the primary to throw her support behind eventual nominee Richard Cordray. Cranley entered the gubernatorial race in August of last year but didn't receive enough votes on Tuesday to continue on. During the campaign, Whaley attacked Cranley for flipping his position on abortion rights. Cranley once had a record of being anti-abortion and supporting measures that restricted the procedure. However, he said through personal situations his position changed and he became a supporter of abortion rights before entering the gubernatorial race. During the campaign, both candidates said they would veto any bill that restricts abortion. U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown, a Democrat, endorsed Whaley as being pro-worker, but Whaley said that doesn't mean she is anti-business. \"I think being pro-worker is being pro-business, actually. What I hear over and over again from businesses is they can't find a strong enough workforce. And I think a lot of that has to do with one; making sure that we invest in our workers from the very young age, and two, that we pay them well,\" Whaley said. If she wins in November, Whaley said she knows she will need to work with a Republican-dominated legislature that's been resistant to Democratic proposals.

Oz recently got the endorsement of former President Donald Trump over his chief rival for the nomination, David McCormick. The Republican primary in the high-stakes Pennsylvania U.S. Senate race has been reshaped since former President Donald Trump offered a coveted endorsement. Mehmet Oz, the celebrity TV doctor who received Trump's backing earlier this month, has cited the endorsement as proof of his conservative credentials. And the campaign of Oz's chief rival, former hedge fund CEO David McCormick, has responded by quickly launching ads designed to blunt the endorsement. One uses archival video to question Oz's conservative beliefs. Another has McCormick surrounded by fellow motorcyclists who are holding Trump flags. Both GOP candidates had lobbied hard for the former president's endorsement. Trump's decision surprised and angered some conservatives. But Trump, a former reality TV star himself, made it clear that Oz's celebrity was a big factor in his choice. \"Tremendous, tremendous career,\" Trump said at a recent rally. \"And they liked him for a long time. That's like a poll. You know, when you're on television for 18 years, that's like a poll.\" He's also said he thinks Oz is more likely to win over a swath of Pennsylvania voters. \"Women, in particular, are drawn to Dr. Oz for his advice and counsel,\" Trump said in a statement announcing his endorsement. \"I have seen this many times over the years. They know him, believe in him, and trust him.\" The open Senate race is likely to be crucial for whichever party controls the chamber. Democrats, too, are locked in a crowded primary. Oz and McCormick \u2014 both ultra-wealthy, first-time candidates \u2014 have been introducing themselves to voters, while trying to bat away any critiques. On the campaign trail, McCormick touts his successful business career, his West Point pedigree and his family's seven generations in the state. \"I grew up with a family farm,\" he said on a small stage in front of a giant American flag at a firehouse in Lititz, Pa. \"I bailed hay, I trimmed Christmas trees, I was a busboy. I had a paper route. I hunted the first Monday after Thanksgiving, and I played football and I wrestled in places like  Shickshinny and Shikellamy.\" More recently, McCormick has lived in Connecticut where he was CEO of one of the world's largest hedge funds, Bridgewater Associates. Prior to that he worked in the administration of President George W. Bush. In the Senate contest, McCormick has faced tough questions about his Wall Street ties and pro-China comments. GOP Senate candidate McCormick meets with attendees during a campaign event in York, Pa., on April 4.\n                \n                    \n                    Matt Rourke/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption For Oz it's an immigrant story. His parents came to the U.S. from Turkey, settling in Ohio. Now he's a celebrity doctor worth millions. \"I attended great universities, raised a family and became a successful surgeon,\" he said in his campaign kickoff video. \"I invented a heart valve that saves thousands of lives. Then I started TV show to advocate for you taking control of your health, and took on the medical establishment.\" But Oz's campaign faced some immediate criticism: that he had until recently been a resident of New Jersey. And there were controversies from his time on TV, including that he dispensed questionable medical advice to his audience. And Oz has also been targeted by many conservatives for his past praise of liberal figures like Hillary Clinton, and his past statements on issues such as abortion, gun laws and the use of masks to combat the coronavirus. Professor Berwood Yost of Franklin & Marshall College says Oz has very high name recognition \u2014 something candidates crave \u2014 but also has high unfavorability scores in primary polls. \"I think Oz's larger problem is that he's not well-liked among Republicans,\" Yost said. \"And that's why I think President Trump's endorsement of Oz is a bit risky.\" One question in the race's final weeks, before the May 17 primary, is whether Trump's endorsement now changes Oz's numbers with conservatives. There are other candidates to note, including political commentator Kathy Barnette, businessman Jeff Bartos and former Trump administration Ambassador Carla Sands. From left: Jeff Bartos, Kathy Barnette and Carla Sands take part in a forum for Pennsylvania Republican U.S. Senate candidates on April 2.\n                \n                    \n                    Matt Rourke/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption From left: Jeff Bartos, Kathy Barnette and Carla Sands take part in a forum for Pennsylvania Republican U.S. Senate candidates on April 2. And polls show that the Senate primary also has a high percentage of voters still undecided. Another question is whether the Trump endorsement will have an effect on those who've not yet made their choice. At the McCormick event at the firehouse, 71-year-old Bob Rapp said he was still trying to make up his mind. But he did say he won't vote for Oz. Rapp is a big Trump supporter, but he's not looking for Trump's guidance on this. \"You don't agree with your leaders 100% of the time,\" he said, before adding a flat \"no\" to whether the former president's endorsement could sway his opinion. But Gina Sanguinetti, who works in health care, said she would give Oz a new look because of Trump, even though she's not sure Oz is strong enough in opposing abortion. She said she's seeking out all the information she can get. \"I'm just going to pay attention to everything right now, but I put a heavy weight on what Donald Trump has to say,\" she said. Still, Sanguinetti is undecided and liked what she heard from McCormick. The endorsement of Oz is actually Trump's second in the primary. He backed Sean Parnell, an Army veteran who dropped out of the race after allegations of physical abuse against his wife and children emerged. (Parnell has denied those accusations.) Parnell is now backing McCormick and said he was \"disappointed\" by Trump's new endorsement.",

He is the Alaska Republican Party Region 2 representative. To her followers around the country, former Republican vice presidential candidate and Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin is a beloved culture warrior. \"Right-winging, bitter-clinging, proud clingers of our guns, our God, our religion and our Constitution,\" is how Palin described the culture she is fighting for in 2016, while on stage with Donald Trump to endorse his run for president. Other than the \"bitter\" part, that description would seem to fit Alaskan retiree and Vietnam veteran Ron Johnson, right down to the American flag t-shirt he wears under a camouflage-printed fleece jacket. Johnson lives about 25 miles from Palin's hometown of Wasilla, the heartland of Alaska conservatism. He's got a Trump sign by his driveway, and he's certainly a proud gun owner. \"Once you get into it, no telling how many guns you'll have. Just right here, there's one above me,\" he told a visitor at the front door of his log home. \"And two set in here, and one on my waist.\" Johnson voted for Palin for governor. But now that she's running for Alaska's sole U.S. House seat? Even this right-wing, gun-toting Republican doesn't want her to win. \"I think she's out of touch with Alaskans right now,\" he said. \"She's moved into a different circle. She was a vice presidential candidate. Yeah, I don't think that the people here \u2014 we don't take her very seriously.\" Ron Johnson in his log house in Butte, Alaska.\n                \n                    \n                    Jeff Chen/Alaska Public Media\n                    \n                \nhide caption Ron Johnson in his log house in Butte, Alaska. That Palin doesn't have the conservative vote locked up on her own ruby-red home turf suggests Alaska's most famous Republican has some challenges to overcome if she's going to be the state's next member of Congress. Johnson doesn't blame Palin for cashing in on her celebrity with a series of TV appearances after a bruising presidential campaign. \"She's made a lot of money and, you know, good for her. I'm glad that she's successful,\" Johnson said. Other local conservatives say some of her televised gigs damaged her stature, like in 2020 when she wore a pink and blue bear suit on the show The Masked Singer and rapped \"Baby Got Back.\" \"That (national) attention ... to me it's just made her more of an embarrassment to Alaskans than someone to respect and support,\" said Karina Wentworth, a stay-at-home mom and marketing manager who lives in Wasilla. Wentworth's politics, like Johnson's, are clear from the driveway: A small banner proclaims her household is \"Pro-life, Pro-God, Pro-gun, Pro-Trump.\" Even though Trump has endorsed Palin's candidacy, even though her kids go to middle school with Sarah Palin's son, Wentworth is just not that into Palin. Wasilla resident Karina Wentworth sets out Easter decorations.\n                \n                    \n                    Jeff Chen/Alaska Public Media\n                    \n                \nhide caption Wasilla resident Karina Wentworth sets out Easter decorations. \"Her focus has become more centered on herself and less on Alaska,\" Wentworth said. \"So yeah, I would like to see a candidate that is more Alaska-focused.\" Wentworth contrasts her own dim view of Palin with that of her in-laws in Georgia, who she says watch Palin on Fox News as \"sparkly-eyed fans.\" Alaska's U.S. House seat is open for the first time in 49 years, after the death in March of Congesssman Don Young. Palin is one of 48 candidates seeking to serve the remainder of his term. Many of them, including Palin, are also running for the next full term, which starts in January. Wentworth is backing a different conservative Republican: Nick Begich III. Begich has done months of outreach in the Wasilla area and has locked up endorsements from dozens of local political leaders. Johnson, a regional representative to the state Republican party, also supports Begich in the race. Shoppers at the Carrs supermarket in Wasilla offered a broader range of views about Palin, from adoration to indifference. \"I don't think many people up here have a very high standing of her,\" said Jennefer DelaVega, a libertarian. Jennefer DelaVega identifies as a libertarian and said she won't be voting for Sarah Palin for Alaska's U.S. House seat.\n                \n                    \n                    Jeff Chen/Alaska Public Media\n                    \n                \nhide caption Jennefer DelaVega identifies as a libertarian and said she won't be voting for Sarah Palin for Alaska's U.S. House seat. \"I think it's great that she's running,\" said Dan Lousberg. \"I'd like to see her win. I think it'd be great for our state.\" Another shopper called Palin \"a quitter.\" That shopper is not unique. In a survey about three years after Palin resigned from the governor's office, Anchorage pollster Ivan Moore said, more than half of Alaskans had a negative view of her. \"We asked them why, and 'quit,' 'quitter' \u2014 all the way down, every other comment was 'quit' or 'quitter,'\" Moore said. Moore asked Alaskans again in October whether they have a positive or negative view of Palin. \"Her positive-negative came back at 31 positive, 56 negative. So that's the immediate problem,\" said Moore, who previously did work for other candidates in the race. The Palin campaign declined several interview requests, but Palin told reporters at Don Young's funeral that she's traveled in the Lower 48, but never moved away from Wasilla. \"Still in the same house. Same group of friends. Same groups of political supporters. And yeah, this is home,\" she said. Her popularity may have dimmed, but Palin is still a household name. Just about everyone expects she will survive the 48-way primary, especially because Alaska has a new voting system in which she only has to be one of the top four vote-getters to advance to the general. What happens after that is harder to say. Alaska Public Media's Jeff Chen contributed reporting from Wasilla.",

Brian Kemp,\" he said before calling Kemp a \"turncoat,\" \"coward\" and \"a complete and total disaster.\" (RINO is a pejorative acronym, standing for \"Republican in name only.\") The governor's race is one of seven in Georgia where Trump has endorsed insurgent candidates to unseat incumbents \u2014 or stamp his brand of conservatism on a race \u2014 from U.S. Senate down to the relatively obscure insurance commissioner. Most of these candidates are running to challenge Kemp, Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and their allies after they certified President Biden's narrow victory in 2020. \"Let's get one thing straight, let me be very clear \u2014 very clear: In the state of Georgia, thanks to Brian Kemp, our elections in 2020 were absolutely stolen,\" said former Sen. David Perdue, Kemp's chief challenger who spoke at the Trump rally. Georgia's elections were not \"stolen\" \u2014 in fact the outcome was verified by three separate counts of the results. Trump's endorsement has been a golden ticket for many Republicans seeking to stand out in contested primary elections, and the former president has made more than 120 endorsements in the 2022 election cycle across the country, so far. Kemp himself was a beneficiary of Trump's endorsement that helped him win the GOP nomination for governor in 2018. But after 2020, the former president has embraced more longshot candidates and is seeking to oust incumbents who did not overturn his defeat. In addition to the governor's race, Trump recruited challengers to unseat Georgia's sitting secretary of state, attorney general and insurance commissioner, along with choices for leader of the state Senate, a wide-open Republican congressional primary and a battleground U.S. Senate race. As governor, Kemp's record on issues like abortion, voting laws, the COVID-19 pandemic and the economy are about as conservative as it gets. A frequent target of the left for these policies, Kemp now finds himself trying to defend his Republican bona fides to the party's base against attacks from the party's leader. Brian Robinson, a Republican strategist in Georgia, said Kemp's record speaks for itself and will be front of mind when voters head to the polls, especially given the way he handled the pandemic and despite the significant power a Trump endorsement has carried. \"Georgia voters know that Kemp stood up against mask mandates, that he cut their taxes, that he's strongly pro-life, that he's passed gun rights expansions,\" he said. \"You can't give them a half story \u2014 because they know the full story. It's got to match up with what they already believe to some degree.\" At a recent Kemp campaign stop in heavily conservative northeast Georgia, voters like John Ford said current Republican incumbents have delivered for voters, so it's still possible to support them \u2014 and Trump. \"He was the president, Brian Kemp is our governor,\" Ford said. \"He's my governor, and he has my vote, and I feel like David Perdue running as a primary candidate is divisive to the cause. We need all the help we can get pulling in the same direction.\" Perdue lags behind Kemp in fundraising and polling, and former football star Herschel Walker, who is running for Senate, is the only clear frontrunner among Trump's Georgia picks. That leads to a concern among Republicans here that the primary infighting could harm them in November, especially in a state that will likely be decided by razor-thin margins. In Pennsylvania, Senate candidate Sean Parnell dropped out last November after abuse allegations. And last week, Trump un-endorsed Alabama Congressman Mo Brooks for the Senate race there after Brooks' campaign stumbled in the polls. Even Trump himself seemed to leave the door open that his endorsements wouldn't be as successful as they once were, in an interview with Real America's Voice this week. \"These are not sure things,\" he said. \"And if I lose one along the way \u2014 and you have to, right? \u2014 they're going to say, 'This was a humiliating experience.' \" At the rally in Georgia, state Sen. Burt Jones, who is running with Trump's support to be lieutenant governor, reiterated that the outcome of Georgia's May 24 primary election affected more than just the seven candidates on the ballot. \"It will set the stage for '24, because all eyes will be on Georgia this year,\" he said. \"And if we don't win big \u2014 if we don't have a red wave \u2014 then it doesn't play well for us to put Donald Trump back in the White House in 2024.\" That sentiment was echoed by Trump at his rally, who said he hoped Perdue would become governor, otherwise he \"wasted a hell of a lot of time here tonight.\"",

In the nearly two months since a conservative majority of justices on the Supreme Court indicated openness to dramatic new restrictions on abortion, money has poured into the political fundraising arm of the anti-abortion group Susan B. Anthony List.The organization secured $20 million in pledged financial contributions, five times more than it has had at the outset of an election year over its 30-year history, according to figures shared with The Associated Press. Before the recent surge, the group had already signed off on its largest-ever political budget, $72 million, for 2022. That's nearly $20 million more than it spent in 2020, a year that included a presidential election. The cash pile virtually guarantees that the Supreme Court's abortion ruling, anticipated by the summer, will do little to quell what has become one of the most animating issues in the United States. Abortion opponents say they will pump their newfound resources into the November elections.Once a decision is issued, \"there will be a lot of focus on all the states and the midterm elections,\" said Marjorie Dannenfelser, the president of Susan B. Anthony List. The Supreme Court is considering a Mississippi law that bans abortions after 15 weeks. If the law is upheld, anti-abortion activists said much of the attention would shift to Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Kansas. These are states with Republican legislatures but Democrats in the governorship, each of whom is up for election in November. If the Supreme Court overturns the Roe v. Wade ruling that women have a constitutional right to an abortion, governors in Michigan and Wisconsin would be powerless to overturn restrictions in their states that were already in place before the 1973 decision.But these governors would be the only obstacle to new measures passed by GOP legislatures, including outright bans on the procedure.A Supreme Court decision is \"really just the beginning of the work,\" said Terry Schilling, president of the socially conservative American Principles Project. \"Groups have actually been really well-connected with state leaders and investing in campaigns at the local level in these swing states, trying to win control in divided governments.\" Supporters of abortion rights, already feeling a heightened sense of alarm by the prospect of a defeat at the Supreme Court, are well aware of how important the governors' races may be to their cause. \"Really truly, governors in many states are going to be our backstop,\" said Jenny Lawson, vice president of organizing and electoral campaigns for Planned Parenthood Action Fund. \"As the decisions come down to the states, these governors are the ones who can protect access.\"She declined to specify how much money the group was budgeting to support candidates who back abortion rights.Some of the Democratic governors up for reelection are increasingly highlighting their commitment to protecting some form of access.\"And as long as I'm governor, that's what I'll do,\" Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers said during a news conference last week marking the 49th anniversary of the Roe decision.

Gretchen Whitmer tweeted last week on the same day organizers of a ballot drive to enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution cleared a procedural step. Over the weekend, Whitmer tweeted that the right to abortion \"hangs by a thread\" in the Supreme Court.For their part, abortion opponents are undeniably upbeat as the Supreme Court decision nears. Thousands gathered on a bitterly cold day in Washington last week for the March for Life, expressing joy and optimism about the prospect of Roe being overturned.But the political fallout from such a move could be volatile for both parties. A decision drastically reducing access to abortion could energize Democrats heading into the fall campaign.The issue is already rising in priority for Democrats, according to a December poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. The poll found that 13% of Democrats listed abortion or reproductive rights as an issue they want the federal government to address. That's up from less than 1% of Democrats who named it as a priority for 2021 and 3% who listed it in 2020.Lawson predicted a court ruling sharply restricting or ending a federal right to abortion would \"drive anger and outrage and cause a realignment at the voting booth.\" There's a risk for religious conservatives as well, who have devoted decades of work to the issue and formed an unlikely alliance with Donald Trump to achieve their goals. The thrice-married former president who once expressed support for abortion rights ultimately named three justices to the Supreme Court, dramatically reshaping it to threaten Roe.But if those justices fall short of overturning that decision or agree to some sort of compromise, conservatives could be deeply disappointed and feel less interested in participating in the midterm elections. The GOP has been stung before, notably when Republican-appointed Chief Justice John Roberts helped uphold President Barack Obama's signature health care law, another issue that had galvanized the right.But for now, opponents say they're buoyed by a sense of momentum.\"It's different now,\" Dannenfelser said. ___Beaumont reported from Des Moines, Iowa.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., is defending his decision to hold failed votes on voting rights legislation and changing the filibuster as a necessary step in holding Republicans and members of his own party accountable for their votes. In an interview with NPR, Schumer downplayed the risks of holding such a public demonstration of the rift within his own party ahead of this year's midterm election. Schumer said the failed votes will help Democrats move forward, but he did not offer a specific plan for how to enact the rest of President Biden's agenda. \"Senators are here to vote. They should be put on record,\" Schumer said in defense of the failed votes. \"Those who are opposed to advancing voting rights and who support suppression of voting rights \u2014 the public should know who they are.\" There has been intense pressure on Schumer and Biden to find a way to negotiate with the two consistent holdouts in their party, Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz. They tried public meetings, private meetings, trips to the White House and public shaming \u2014 all without success. Schumer said the votes that failed this week in the Senate forced every lawmaker to take sides in front of the country, including activists and members of the party's base. \"Now the public knows where people stand,\" he said. \"I think those who voted against it will feel a lot of heat.\" Schumer also defended Biden's negotiating strategy on voting rights in particular. \"He has made it clear how he felt he gave three very powerful speeches,\" Schumer said. \"He spoke individually to Senators Manchin and Sinema. So he's working alongside us because both of us feel that this is a vital issue to the republic.\" The blame, he said, lies with two Democrats who ignored the rest of the Democratic Party and viewed Senate rules as \"less important than the right to vote.\" Schumer is marking his own first anniversary as Senate majority leader. In that time, Democrats have passed the nearly $2 trillion American Rescue Plan to address the coronavirus crisis and a separate $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill. But the vast majority of Biden's domestic agenda, including addressing climate change, voting rights and an expansion of the social safety net, continues to languish in the Senate. Speaking Thursday in his office at the Capitol, Schumer echoed the words Biden used a day before at his own news conference marking his first year in office. \"We've had a successful year,\" Schumer said. \"We haven't had it completely successful, but you keep fighting.\" \"We're in the week of MLK Day, the inspiration of Dr. King who never gave up, who didn't let setbacks set him back and who didn't shy from tough fights, even though the outcome was not clear at the beginning,\" he said. \"That's our inspiration.\" Democrats are preparing for what could be a brutal election in November. Historically, it is common for the party of the president to lose seats in a midterm election. Plus, Democrats have to contend with newly drawn congressional lines that could reduce their numbers on their own. But Democrats have also failed to follow through on some of the most basic promises to voters, like passing new voting rights protections. Schumer focused instead on what Democrats did achieve. \"The [American Rescue Plan] bill is one of the most progressive and important pieces of legislation in decades. We've put more judges in, these are life time appointments,\" he said. \"We put more judges in office in the first year of a president's term or a majority leader's term than anyone since ... 40 or 50 years.\" He said those achievements \u2014 paired with the work Democrats were able to complete with the help of Republicans \u2014 make for a significant record. \"We got a big bipartisan bill done, the bipartisan infrastructure bill done, and many other things as well,\" Schumer said. \"Are we going to continue to fight on voting rights? Yes.\"",

WASHINGTON \u2014 With Roe v. Wade facing its strongest threat in decades, a new poll finds Democrats increasingly view protecting abortion rights as a high priority for the government. Thirteen percent of Democrats mentioned abortion or reproductive rights as one of the issues they want the federal government to address in 2022, according to a December poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. That's up from less than 1% of Democrats who named it as a priority for 2021 and 3% who listed it in 2020. Some other issues like the economy, COVID-19, health care and gun control ranked as higher priorities for Democrats in the poll, which allowed respondents to name up to five top issues. But the exponential rise in the percentage citing reproductive rights as a key concern suggests the issue is resonating with Democrats as the Supreme Court considers cases that could lead to dramatic restrictions on abortion access. \"The public have lots of things that they want to see government addressing,\" said Jennifer Benz, deputy director of The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. \"You ask this kind of question in a time of economic turmoil and in the time of a pandemic and all of these other things going on, we might not expect abortion to rise to the top.\" With a 6-3 conservative majority on the Supreme Court, Republicans see this as their best chance in years to overturn Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision legalizing abortion throughout the United States. In December, the Supreme Court left in place a Texas law that bans most abortions in the state and signaled during arguments that they would uphold a Mississippi law that bans abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy. That decision will be made public in June. Calling the abortion polling numbers \"stark,\" Benz noted that conventional wisdom holds that abortion is a motivating issue for Republicans and not for Democrats. Research from the 1980s and 1990s, Benz said, \"regularly found that opponents of abortion had greater strength of attitudes and considered the issue important to them personally more than pro-choice people.\" That may be changing. Sam Lau, senior director for advocacy media at the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, believes more Americans are recognizing this moment as a crisis for abortion access. \"I think what we have seen is absolutely an increase in awareness, an increase in urgency, an increase in the need to fight back,\" he said. \"But I still actually think that huge swaths of this population still don't quite believe that the access to abortion and the 50-year precedent that is Roe v. Wade is really hanging in the balance.\" The court's 1973 decision, reaffirmed in the 1992 ruling in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, allows states to regulate but not ban abortion up to the point of fetal viability, at roughly 24 weeks. If Roe and Casey are overturned in June, abortion would soon become illegal or severely restricted in roughly half the states, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that supports abortion rights. That's just months ahead of midterm elections that are expected to be challenging for Democrats. Lau thinks people are starting to recognize they \"simply cannot rely on the courts to protect our rights and our access to essential health care.\" \"We are currently pushing for elected officials who are champions of sexual and reproductive health care to be bold and to go on offense and to pass proactive legislation to protect access to abortion,\" Lau said. \"I think voters are going to go to the polls and want to vote for candidates who they can trust to protect their health care and their reproductive freedom.\" Polling shows relatively few Americans want to see Roe overturned. In 2020, AP VoteCast, a survey of the electorate, showed 69% of voters in the presidential election said the Supreme Court should leave the Roe v. Wade decision as is; just 29% said the court should overturn the decision. In general, AP-NORC polling shows a majority of the public favors abortion being legal in most or all cases. Still, Americans have nuanced attitudes on the issue, and many don't think that abortion should be possible after the first trimester or that women should be able to obtain a legal abortion for any reason. For 41-year-old Rachelle Dunn, who knew girls in high school and women in college and her adult life who have needed abortions, it's \"just health care.\" \"It's something that women I have known through my life have needed for different reasons,\" said Dunn, of Tarentum, Pa. \"The government needs to step in because all of these laws are being written and passed, but none of them are for medical reasons.\" She's concerned about a domino effect from these Supreme Court cases, adding that she worries about how they will affect her two daughters' futures, as well as her son's. \"It just seems like, if it's been affirmed, repeatedly, why are we still doing this?\" Dunn said.",

            "article_content": "Many hospitals and health care clinics in the U.S. are affiliated with the Catholic Church, which means religious directives might limit the types of contraception they can offer.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: This summer's abrupt changes in abortion laws are having a number of side effects, from the political to the personal. Abortion has become an issue in many of this year's election campaigns. And changing laws also raise the stakes for contraception. The effort to obtain it is complicated for many people served by Catholic institutions. Catholic health care serves people across this country, although many hospitals and clinics are subject to ethical and religious directives issued by the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops. Hospitals will not perform tubal ligation or vasectomies. And some clinics will not fit IUDs or prescribe birth control pills to prevent pregnancy. NPR's Maria Godoy has been looking at the implications of these restrictions, and her story begins with a personal experience. MARIA GODOY, BYLINE: So when I, you know, was pregnant with my second child and I knew that was going to be my final child - and I was having a scheduled C-section. And my sister the last week before said, hey, you know, you - if you know you're done, why don't you get your tubes tied? And I said, oh, good idea. And I didn't have a chance to ask my doctor until I was actually on the operating table. And I said, while you're down there, would you mind tying my tubes? And he told me, I can't, actually, because this is a Catholic hospital, and they don't allow that here. INSKEEP: I just want people to know, you grew up Catholic, but you still were a little bit surprised about what was and was not allowed in a Catholic hospital. GODOY: Yeah, absolutely. And, you know, this kind of lack of awareness is pretty widespread, but turns out so is Catholic health care. It actually goes back to the early days of the country. Catholic sisters went around the U.S. setting up hospitals. And over time, those hospitals banded together to form health networks. And we actually see the impact today. You know, four of the 10 largest health care systems in the country are Catholic. In some counties, they dominate the market. In 52 communities, the only local hospital is Catholic. INSKEEP: And it's not just hospitals? GODOY: Right. So there's been a lot of consolidation in the health care system just in general. And now you see Catholic health networks that have bought up doctors practices, urgent care clinics, surgery centers. These are now subject to Catholic religious directives, which, among other things, ban contraception for the sole purpose of preventing pregnancy. I actually talked to Debra Stulberg of the University of Chicago. She's done a lot of research on how these religious directives play out when it comes to reproductive health. DEBRA STULBERG: You cannot promote or condone contraception other than natural family planning for married couples under specific sort of church-sanctioned situations. That ban on contraception includes a ban on permanent contraception - so things like tubal ligation and vasectomy. GODOY: And other forms of contraception as well - and this has the potential to impact a lot of people. One study, for example, found nearly 40% of women of reproductive age live in areas of the country where Catholic hospitals are big players or dominate the market. INSKEEP: How strictly are the religious directives enforced in those institutions? GODOY: The answer is it varies a lot. One thing Stulberg's research has found is many of the doctors who work at Catholic-owned or affiliated hospitals will often employ workarounds. So, for instance, while the directives ban contraception to prevent pregnancy, they do allow it for other medical uses. So you might find lots of prescriptions for hormonal birth control pills or IUDs that are written to control, quote-unquote, \"heavy bleeding.\" STULBERG: If a patient is interested in a hormonal IUD and the provider is prohibited from providing it for contraceptive purposes, if the patient says that they have very heavy periods and are interested in treatment for that, in many cases, the provider can provide it for that reason. GODOY: So I heard this over and over again from the doctors I talked to. They wanted to help their patients prevent pregnancy. But they have to find another reason for providing birth control. One of them, Dr. Corinne McLeod, told me when she worked at a Catholic hospital in Albany, N.Y., several years ago, tubal ligation, which is a permanent form of birth control - it was prohibited. But doctors could remove a woman's fallopian tubes altogether if they said it was to reduce her risk of ovarian cancer. CORINNE MCLEOD: And that was basically a wink, wink, nudge, nudge. We're just doing it for - to reduce your risk for ovarian cancer, and it happens to also keep you from getting pregnant. GODOY: So they couldn't tie a patient's tubes, but they could remove them altogether. INSKEEP: In spite of these workarounds, are some options just not available to some women? GODOY: Yeah. So people who study this say workarounds are less likely to be available for certain kinds of birth control. For example, it was rare to get one if you wanted a copper IUD, which is one of the most effective forms of long-acting, reversible contraception. Debra Stulberg has done surveys that find a lot of people don't realize their choices may be limited because they don't know their health provider is governed by these rules. STULBERG: And of the people that had some kind of a reproductive health refusal, the majority - it wasn't until either they were there or afterwards that they, you know, found out that they couldn't get what they wanted. INSKEEP: What should women do when they can't get what they want? GODOY: It partly depends on their health insurance and whether or not the providers covered under the plan are subject to these religious directives. So ask questions when you are choosing health insurance. Check out the options and providers. And when you're booking an appointment for birth control and you know what type you want, ask ahead of time if that specific form is offered. But the fact is, for some people, depending on where they live or their insurance plan, there may just not be any other option. STULBERG: In some cases, women truly have no other choices. This hospital or this system is the only provider in town. GODOY: Low-income women on Medicaid, by law, are supposed to have access to at least some providers that offer contraception. But Stulberg's research has found that's not always the case either. INSKEEP: What did the Catholic hospitals tell you about this? GODOY: I reached out to the Catholic Health Association of the U.S. They couldn't make anyone available to talk, but they did send a statement acknowledging that Catholic health providers don't offer services for, quote, \"the sole purpose of contraception.\" But they said they do offer services to address underlying medical conditions. They say Catholic hospitals have a long history of caring for women and children. INSKEEP: NPR's Maria Godoy. Thanks so much. GODOY: My pleasure.

            "article_content": "President Trump appointed three Supreme Court justices and nominated 274 individuals to federal judgeships. Journalist David Enrich says many of those picks were influenced by lawyers from the firm of Jones Day.\n                \n                    \n                    Al Drago/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption President Trump appointed three Supreme Court justices and nominated 274 individuals to federal judgeships. Journalist David Enrich says many of those picks were influenced by lawyers from the firm of Jones Day. Editor's note: Jones Day is an underwriter for NPR and has done work for NPR in the past. While campaigning for president in 2016, Donald Trump famously cast himself as a Washington outsider, someone who would \"drain the swamp\" of special interests and cronyism. But New York Times journalist David Enrich notes that both Trump's candidacy and his administration were shaped, in no small part, by Jones Day, one of the most politically connected law firms in DC. For much of Jones Day's history, it was a juggernaut in the field of corporate litigation, raking in billions a year in fees from tobacco, opioid, gun and oil companies, among many other giant corporations. But, as Enrich writes in his book, Servants of the Damned, the firm became particularly embroiled in politics during the Trump administration. \"They were more embedded in the Trump administration than any law firm I can think of in any past presidential administration,\" Enrich says. \"Throughout the White House and the Justice Department, as well as other agencies, basically, everywhere you looked, you would find a once and future Jones Day lawyer.\" Enrich points out that Don McGahn, a prominent Jones Day lawyer, left the firm to become Trump's White House counsel. McGahn assumed the responsibility of   picking the judges Trump would nominate to the federal courts, including the Supreme Court. \"One of the core kind of tenets of McGahn's judicial philosophy was this real antipathy toward what he calls derisively 'the administrative state,'\" Enrich says. \"And one of the biggest results of that is that it translates into judges who no longer give nearly as much deference to the rights and authority of federal agencies as had been the norm.\" Enrich says lawyers from Jones Day cycled back and forth between the Trump administration and private practice, where they would go right back to representing corporate clients \u2014 in some cases with interests before the Trump administration. \"The notion that this outsider trying to shake things up would turn to a firm like Jones Day to staff his administration and help pick his judges and things like that, it is really antithetical to that,\" Enrich says. \"When I think of the swamp and I think when Trump thinks of the swamp, there are few swampier things than that type of inside baseball lobbying.\" On the outsized role Jones Day played in the Trump administration Servants of the Damned, by David Enrich\n                \n                    \n                    Harper Collins\n                    \n                \nhide caption Servants of the Damned, by David Enrich Starting in 2015, the law firm represented his campaign, and they did so through the 2016 cycle and then again the 2020 campaign, that was work that basically started on Inauguration Day of 2017. And so they were front and center on both of his presidential campaigns, but they were not representing him personally. ... The White House counsel, Don McGahn, was a very prominent Jones Day lawyer, and he surrounded himself in the White House with several senior Jones Day partners and associates who he brought with him. At the Justice Department, the solicitor general, Noel Francisco, was once and future Jones Day partner. And in the upper echelons of both in the civil division of the Justice Department you had some of the people right beneath the attorney general were from Jones Day. You had someone at the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Commerce Department, on and on the list goes. On Jones Day accomplishing political interests once Trump was in office Shortly after Trump became president, Jones Day lawyers, both inside the administration and outside the administration, those still at the firm, started accomplishing things that they had long sought to accomplish but had not been able to do. And the clearest example of this to me is a series of lawsuits that Jones Day had brought on behalf of a bunch of Catholic organizations that were basically challenging an important provision of Obamacare, the Affordable Care Act. ... One of the first things that [the Trump] administration does with the help of Don McGahn, is they basically say they're going to end an Obama administration policy that sought to require employers to provide contraception coverage for their employees, which was part of Obamacare. And this was the subject of the lawsuit. So right on the face, it represented a big win for Jones Day and its clients. On Jones Day's political agenda The law firm isn't a monolith, and I think it's important to kind of say that at the outset. And this is a law firm that has something like 2,500 lawyers in dozens of countries all over the world. And like any large organization or large law firm, there are employees and lawyers at Jones Day that have, I think, a wide range of political views ranging from far left to far right. What sets Jones apart is the degree to which the leadership of the firm is fairly uniform in their conservative thinking. ... Their agenda ... ranged from lots of deregulation and really getting the government out of the affairs of businesses to a very large extent, and then also an agenda of what I think the right people on the right would call \"religious liberty.\" And I think people on the left and to a certain degree, people in the center would say much dramatically eroding the separation of church and state in a way that allows religion to play a much more prominent role in public and political life. On how Don McGahn, former Jones Day lawyer, ended up picking SCOTUS nominees for Trump Shortly after Trump was elected, Mitch McConnell gave some advice to Don McGahn. The advice was that instead of relying on a committee at the White House to debate and pick nominees for the Supreme Court and other federal courts, McConnell's advice was, \"Look, you should get Trump's permission to just do this by yourself. You alone should have the power to pick the judges that Trump will nominate.\" McGahn liked the sound of that. He proposed it to Trump and Trump when he offered McGahn, the job of White House counsel, readily agreed to this. And so McGahn, very quickly, before Trump even was sworn in as president, all of a sudden was sitting on this enormous power that was really quite unusual historically. And he was the one who would be picking the people that Trump nominated to all sorts of federal courts. On McGahn going back to Jones Day after working in the Trump administration He came right back, got a big promotion, got a bunch more money. And he was kind of the first in what would become a whole parade of people who went from the Trump administration back into the law firm. A lot of these were people who had started off of Jones Day, then went to the Trump administration and then returned. But there were also a lot of people who had not previously worked at Jones Day, had worked at maybe at other law firms. And with the return of McGahn, Jones Day became essentially a refuge for veterans of the Trump administration, who many of whom had really developed quite controversial backstories and had taken quite controversial and polarizing and legally dubious actions while in the Trump administration and therefore, I think, were pretty radioactive for many other big law firms. But Jones Day welcomed many of them with open arms. On Jones Day taking advantage of the judicial revolution it set in motion It's now bringing cases through the Supreme Court and through the lower courts that were basically made possible by this deluge of very conservative federal judges that are now on the benches of many courts. So just in the Supreme Court's past term, which was obviously one of the most radical and farthest reaching the Supreme Court terms, certainly of my lifetime, and Jones Day played pivotal roles in some of these cases. And I think the biggest one was the case, the West Virginia versus EPA case that dramatically hemmed in the power of the EPA to regulate carbon emissions. And that was brought on behalf of the Jones Day client, a big coal company. Jones Day was the law firm that basically ended the eviction moratorium during the pandemic that the Biden administration had imposed. And Jones Day, just reading the tea leaves and talking to their lawyers now, it's quite clear that they are plotting a wide range of attacks on the power of the federal government to oversee private businesses and private companies in a way that goes back to Don McGahn and his colleagues' hatred of the so-called administrative state. And they are now in a position to be able to much more forcefully advocate those positions and be successful in their advocacy \u2014 thanks to all of the judges that Trump, at McGahn's direction and with McConnell's support, managed to get on to virtually every federal court in the country.

Congressional Democrats are working to codify same-sex marriage and other rights that they fear are at risk following the Supreme Court's ruling on Roe v. Wade.\n                \n                    \n                    Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Sen. Tammy Baldwin speaks at a May press conference in Washington, D.C. Congressional Democrats are working to codify same-sex marriage and other rights that they fear are at risk following the Supreme Court's ruling on Roe v. Wade. The Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade didn't just disrupt abortion access across the country. It also raised concerns that other landmark rulings \u2014 including those legalizing birth control and same-sex marriage \u2014 could be next. While Justice Samuel Alito stressed in his opinion that the legal logic behind the Roe decision would not apply to other cases, Justice Clarence Thomas has suggested otherwise. He wrote in his concurring opinion that future cases \"should reconsider all of this Court's substantive due process precedents,\" specifically listing those that protect contraception, same-sex relationships and same-sex marriage. Democrats in Congress are now working to codify those protections into law, starting with marriage equality. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., is at the forefront of that effort in the Senate. The task is especially personal for Baldwin, who in 2012 made history as the country's first openly gay person (and first Wisconsin woman) to be elected to the Senate. \"There's an old adage that if you're not in the room the conversation is about you, if you're in the room the conversation is with you \u2014 and that makes all the difference,\" Baldwin says. \"I'm experiencing that right now. People who might have said this is just a political issue understand that for somebody in the LGBTQ community, it's a personal matter.\" The Supreme Court's 2015 ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges established a right to same-sex marriage across the U.S. \u2014 one that plaintiff Jim Obergefell now worries is on shaky ground. He's one of many LGBTQ advocates who wants Congress to protect these rights at the federal level. \"If Congress can't step up and say, these are the rights we believe in, these are the fundamental rights, the human rights, the civil rights that deserve protection, if not from the Supreme Court under law, then what is worth fighting for?\" he told NPR's All Things Considered last month. The Respect for Marriage Act, which would enshrine same-sex and interracial marriage in federal law, passed the House of Representatives last week. While 47 Republicans voted in favor, other GOP critics have portrayed the bill as unnecessary, dismissing it as election-year politics and downplaying the threat of future Supreme Court action. The bill now faces the challenge of getting through an equally divided Senate, where 60 votes are needed to overcome a filibuster. All Democrats are already on board, and President Biden is urging the Senate to send it to his desk for a signature as swiftly as possible. Baldwin is leading the charge to secure the 10 Republican votes needed to pass the measure. She's been working behind the scenes to try to whip up support from her Republican colleagues, including confronting Sen. Marco Rubio on an elevator after overhearing him call the bill \"a stupid waste of time.\" She says five Republican senators have signaled their support so far, and is optimistic that others will follow. \"The conversations are very hopeful, and I will say that a number of Republicans have privately agreed to support the bill, but not publicly,\" she tells Morning Edition's Leila Fadel. \"And so we don't want to bring it to the floor until we know that we can pass the legislation, with the 60 requisite votes.\" On why Republicans who support the bill aren't saying so in public It's hard for me to speak for everybody and their motivation, but I think there's some uncertainty among my Republican colleagues as to whether the bill actually will get to the floor and receive a vote, and so that leads to some hesitance to publicly declare one's stance. On why marriage equality seems to be a less divisive issue than abortion rights In the years since the Supreme Court made marriage equality the law of the land in the Obergefell decision, more and more of my colleagues have friends, family, coworkers, staff members who are married to a same-sex partner. That really changes, I think, one's focus. Even if years ago there was some hesitance to support marriage equality, it's now part of most people's everyday reality to know somebody who has married in order to provide legal protections for their family. [Public support for same-sex marriage has reached an all-time high of 70%, according to a Gallup poll released in June, the first in which a majority of Republicans approves.] On why federal action is needed to protect marriage equality It's a different Supreme Court today than it was in 2015, and certainly I know so many who are very worried about the certainty of their marriage. Marriage confers with it rights and responsibilities that allow you to protect your family, to access your spouse, say in the hospital in a medical emergency \u2014 without marriage you're a legal stranger, with marriage you have that access. And that's one of just hundreds of examples of what a marriage confers, in terms of those rights and responsibilities. I know that there's a high level of urgency to protect marriage and marriage equality. This interview was conducted by Leila Fadel, produced by Shelby Hawkins and edited by HJ Mai.",

Wade. \"The health and life of women of our nation are now at risk,\" Biden said. \"Make no mistake. This decision is the culmination of a deliberate effort over decades to upset the balance of our law.\" Biden emphasized that this is the first time the court has revoked a constitutional right, calling it a \"sad day for the court and for the country.\" \"Voters need to make their voices heard,\" Biden said, calling on them to elect candidates that will restore the right to an abortion at the congressional and local level. \"This fall Roe is on the ballot. Personal freedoms are on the ballot. The right to privacy, liberty, equality, they're all on the ballot.\" The president said he would look to use his power to protect the women in the states that may ban abortion and more announcements would come in the following weeks.

He made clear that it would be up to Congress to restore abortion protections for federal law. \"No executive actions ... can do that,\" he said. Following Biden's speech, former President Donald Trump issued a statement taking credit for the decision. \"I delivered everything as promised, including nominating and getting three highly respected and strong Constitutionalists confirmed to the United States Supreme Court,\" he said. \"It was my great honor to do so!\" Within minutes of the ruling's release, Democratic congressional leaders put out statements admonishing voters to elect more Democrats while Republicans praised years of activism and pushed to go further. Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.V., called out two of the justices who joined the majority: \"I trusted Justice Gorsuch and Justice Kavanaugh when they testified under oath that they also believed Roe v. Wade was settled legal precedent and I am alarmed they chose to reject the stability the ruling has provided for two generations of Americans.\" Democrats currently control Congress, but they are expected to lose those majorities in the November midterm elections, which would allow Republicans to pass legislation on abortion. A visibly angry House Speaker Nancy Pelosi denounced the decision and vowed the issue would be a factor in the midterm elections. Pelosi warned: \"Be aware of this: the Republican are plotting a nationwide abortion ban. They cannot be allowed to have a majority in the Congress to do that, but that's their goal.\" The parties have fought bitterly about abortion rights for years, and Friday's statements highlighted the acrimony between them, as they traded accusations of \"extremism\" and being \"radicals.\" Rep. Kevin McCarthy, the top Republican in the House, said on Twitter that \"we must keep rejecting extreme policies that seek to allow late-term abortions and taxpayer dollars to fund these elective procedures. Much work remains to protect the most vulnerable among us.\" Senate Minority leader Mitch McConnell also called Democrats \"extreme on abortion.\" Saying that he shared in the joy anti-abortion activists were experiencing, McConnell called the decision is \"an historic victory for the Constitution.\"",

            "article_content": "The draft Supreme Court opinion that would overturn Roe v. Wade sparked a fierce reaction in the political world, with potentially major ramifications for the midterm elections.  ADRIAN FLORIDO, HOST: If the decision to overturn Roe is ultimately handed down from the court, the political implications could be monumental. Last night's leak has already triggered a political earthquake. We're joined now by NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson, NPR's Kelsey Snell on Capitol Hill and NPR's Sarah McCammon, who covers abortion. Welcome to all of you. KELSEY SNELL, BYLINE: Hello. SARAH MCCAMMON, BYLINE: Hi. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Happy to be here. FLORIDO: Mara, let's start with you. Chief Justice John Roberts today confirmed that this draft decision was authentic. He said it is not final. President Biden had a pretty strong reaction after the chief justice announced that. He called this draft decision radical before taking off in Air Force One today. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: If the rationale of the decision as released were to be sustained, a whole range of rights are in question - a whole range of rights. And the idea we're letting the states make those decisions, localities make those decisions would be a fundamental shift in what we've done. FLORIDO: What do you make of that reaction, Mara? LIASSON: Well, he talked about two things - what's at stake, meaning all these other things that would fall under the right to privacy, which that draft questioned, the right to marry, gay marriage, the right to use contraception. That would also be in the balance. So the president was focusing on what's at stake other than just the right to abortion, and then he also talked about the remedy. He said it's up to voters to elect pro-abortion rights legislators at every level - Senate, House, also state legislatures. And this is the big question for Democrats. They've never been seized with the importance of the courts like conservatives have, who have focused for 50 years on overturning Roe. Democrats haven't done that. And now the question is, does this ruling, assuming it becomes a ruling, have a boomerang effect? Will liberal voters feel like their rights are under threat? Will they be more energized to come out to vote? Or will this take a second or third place behind inflation, crime and immigration as issues for the midterms? We don't know that yet. FLORIDO: Well, Kelsey, now that Democrats in Congress know that this draft opinion could become final in the coming months, do they have any plans to act on abortion protections? SNELL: Well, the vast majority of them said they're outraged. They say these are the kinds of actions Democrats have warned voters could happen since way back during the 2016 presidential election, when Republicans held up former President Obama's nominee to replace Justice Antonin Scalia after he died. You know, Democrats generally promised today to fight to protect Roe. And Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer promised that there will be votes even if they fail. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CHUCK SCHUMER: It's a different world now. The tectonic plates of our politics on women's choice and on rights in general are changing. Every senator now under the real glare of Roe v. Wade being repealed by the courts is going to have to show which side they're on. SNELL: But, you know, in reality, Democrats do not have the votes to pass federal abortion protections right now. And putting people on the record might be the best they can hope for. They would need either 60 votes to overcome a filibuster or a feasible plan to end the filibuster. I will note that Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia told reporters today that he still supports the filibuster. FLORIDO: Well, that's Democrats. I want to ask you about two Republican senators, though, Kelsey - Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine. They have both supported abortion rights in the past. SNELL: Right. And they both said the decision would be inconsistent with what they were told by justices during their confirmation processes. Collins specifically named Justices Gorsuch and Kavanaugh. Murkowski went further, and she told a group of reporters that a draft decision rocked her confidence in the court. A little bit later, she added this. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LISA MURKOWSKI: It was not the direction that I believed that the court would take based on statements that have been made about Roe being settled and being precedent. SNELL: Now, you know, they both pointed to a narrow bill that they've supported and sponsored that talks about prohibiting states from imposing what they call an undue burden on the ability of a woman to obtain an abortion. But that would allow states to impose some restrictions still. And, you know, that plan might win their support. But two Republicans and 48 or 50 Democrats still does not equal the 60 votes they would need for the bill to pass. FLORIDO: Sarah McCammon, I'd like to bring you in here. You're going to be reporting on this elsewhere in the program. But briefly, what are abortion rights advocates saying about this Supreme Court leak? MCCAMMON: Well, as you might expect, even though this was somewhat expected, they're saying it's devastating, especially for people who already struggle to get access to abortion disproportionately - people of color, people in rural areas. But they are expressing some optimism that this could galvanize Democratic voters in the 2022 midterms as well as in '24. Mini Timmaraju, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, believes that this is going to be a wake up-call, as she put it, that will turn out progressive voters even more than, for example, after the 2016 election, which did lead to a blue wave in 2018. MINI TIMMARAJU: We are seeing a ton of support and energy from our advocates, our donors, our voters, our volunteers to mobilize. Sometimes you need that extra push. And unfortunately, as horrific as this is, this is probably it. And we're going to invest significantly to make it so. MCCAMMON: And on that note, a coalition of major reproductive rights groups, including NARAL, announced that they're spending $150 million this year toward voter mobilization efforts. They're targeting congressional races, of course, along with governors' races given the increasing importance of state legislation. FLORIDO: And what about abortion opponents, Sarah? They've been wanting to overturn Roe v. Wade for a long time. If the court does, in fact, follow through, where do they go from here? MCCAMMON: Well, they've been a little cautious in their response given that this is a leaked draft. But this has been a decades-long goal if this holds. A coalition largely made up of conservative Catholics and evangelical Protestants have been working strategically toward this goal at every level of government for decades, trying to pass state laws that could soon ban most abortions in about half of U.S. states. I talked to Kristan Hawkins with Students for Life today. She says her group is working to pass more early abortion bans around six weeks or earlier. KRISTAN HAWKINS: We need to be talking about a law that bans abortions when children can - children's hearts begin to be detected or laws that protect life at conception. MCCAMMON: And her group and others are working toward the idea of a national abortion ban. That, of course, would take a majority in Congress as well as the White House, but it is one of their longer-term goals. FLORIDO: Kelsey, is that something that Republicans in Congress are talking about? SNELL: Republicans I talked to today - and I talked to many - they really didn't engage with the substance of the decision or discuss whether they would go further to pass federal abortion restrictions if they do take majorities in the House and the Senate. You know, instead, they mostly focused on the leaker. They called for an investigation, and some called for eventual prosecution of the leaker. I should point out, though, that, you know, polls have consistently shown that a majority of Americans oppose overturning Roe v. Wade. The latest Gallup data has 58% of Americans against overturning it. And an NPR poll last month gave Republicans a broad advantage in the midterms but also indicated that voters feel Democrats would do a better job on the issue of abortion by 11 points. FLORIDO: Mara, a quick final word goes to you. The Supreme Court prides itself on the idea that it's not a political body. So what are the implications of the court making such a major ruling and potentially breaking with public opinion on an issue that stirs up such strong feelings? LIASSON: Well, historically, the Supreme Court has been on the opposite side of majority public opinion many, many times. But what's happening now is that there's a much bigger debate that's starting. A majority of the Supreme Court justices were appointed by presidents who became president despite losing the popular vote. And the senators who confirmed some of those justices represented a minority of Americans. So we're moving from a system where the founders wanted minority party rights to be protected to a system that is looking a lot more like minority rule. And the big question is, does the majority of Americans want this to continue or not?

            "article_content": "Democrats say the leaked Supreme Court draft decision may erode more than abortion access. The leak also ups the attention on midterms. Moscow agrees to open a humanitarian corridor for civilians.  A MART\u00cdNEZ, HOST: Democrats say overturning Roe v. Wade could erode much more than abortion access. LEILA FADEL, HOST: And according to Democrats, gay marriage and birth control are just some of the civil rights under threat. So what would the legal basis be to overturn what has been a bedrock of American law for the past 50 years? MART\u00cdNEZ: NPR political correspondent Danielle Kurtzleben is here to explain the legal and political ramifications. Danielle, let's start with the legal side of things. Are gay marriage and birth control linked to abortion in legal terms? DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN, BYLINE: They are connected, and that's because under Roe, the court found that abortion is what's called an unenumerated right under the 14th Amendment. That means that is - that the Constitution protects the right, even if the Constitution doesn't explicitly say abortion is protected. Now, Alito, in this leaked draft, he argues that when the 14th Amendment was passed in 1868, American law didn't at the time recognize abortion as a fundamental right; therefore, abortion isn't a constitutional right. Now, I spoke to Mary Ziegler. She's a visiting professor at Harvard Law School. And she explained how this logic could carry over to a lot of other rights. MARY ZIEGLER: Obviously, at the time the relevant part of the Constitution was written, same-sex couples could not marry. Interracial couples certainly couldn't marry. Birth control was being criminalized. And so the logic is, if that's how we determine where our constitutional rights begin and end, there's no reason that would stop with abortion. KURTZLEBEN: Now, in this leaked draft, Alito does say that Roe is separate from all these other rights because it is specifically about fetal life. But that doesn't mean the court couldn't change its mind in the future. MART\u00cdNEZ: And this has quickly become a central message for Democrats. What's the political logic behind that? KURTZLEBEN: You know, I've asked a lot of people who support abortion rights how they feel about that argument because activists have criticized top Democrats, including Biden, heavily for seemingly being reluctant to even use the word abortion. So grouping it together with these other rights might read as reluctance or changing the subject. But Renee Bracey Sherman - she's the founder of abortion rights advocacy group We Testify - she explained to me that connecting abortion to other rights is about helping voters see abortion as a fundamental part of a landscape of rights that are all connected to each other and also about just educating voters. RENEE BRACEY SHERMAN: A lot of people think, I might never need an abortion. And a lot of people think about all issues like, oh, I'm not trans. I'm not Black. Why does police brutality matter to me? But I think what people don't realize is how much something like Roe v. Wade is the bedrock of so many other things legally. MART\u00cdNEZ: Yeah, we're all living together in the same space. Now, what do we know about how the argument will play out with voters across the nation in November? Because Democrats were expected to do poorly in the midterms. Could this possibly help them out? KURTZLEBEN: Surprise, surprise - it's complicated. A majority of Americans do believe abortion should be legal in some or all circumstances. But a plurality are in that some category - they think there should be some restrictions. Pollster Tresa Undem told me that that is important because a lot of Americans also just don't feel very emotional about the topic of abortion, and it doesn't come up for them. But that might change if Roe is overturned. TRESA UNDEM: That is going to break through to people. They don't have to read a political article. They're going to hear about it. They're going to be upset about it. They're going to be surprised by it - maybe not shocked, but surprised. KURTZLEBEN: So the idea is people might hear that a right that they've been taking for granted for nearly 50 years could be taken away, and they'll be angry. Now, that said, we don't know how this is going to play out. But to be clear, there are much more immediate consequences. If Roe is overturned, greater abortion restrictions in many states would start immediately, well before November. MART\u00cdNEZ: That's NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben. Danielle, thanks. KURTZLEBEN: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MART\u00cdNEZ: All right, let's see how a potential reversal on abortion rights is playing out in a state that's holding primaries in just a few weeks. FADEL: And we're talking about Georgia. This key swing state holds its primaries on May 24. MART\u00cdNEZ: WABE's Sam Gringlas joins us from Atlanta. So, Sam, what would abortion access look like in Georgia if this draft decision holds up in the Supreme Court? SAM GRINGLAS, BYLINE: Well, Georgia's Legislature is solidly Republican, and in 2018, they passed a bill banning abortion after roughly six weeks. That law would likely take effect pretty quickly if Roe is struck down. You know, Republicans have poured resources into state House races for, like, the last dozen years, and Democrats now admit that for a long time, they didn't really invest enough in these legislatures. I talked about that with Jessica Post. She runs the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee. JESSICA POST: We need to do everything we can to win state legislatures. So I know folks right now may be giving to abortion funds. I would also say please support your Democratic state legislative candidates because they will be the ones deciding the fate of abortion in your state. GRINGLAS: So say Democrat Stacey Abrams wins her campaign for governor here, without the Legislature there's just not a whole lot she can do to undo laws that are already on the books. MART\u00cdNEZ: And we just heard Danielle Kurtzleben talk about how Democrats are shaping their midterm strategy around this draft opinion. How is that playing out in Georgia? GRINGLAS: Well, Democrats think this ruling could energize voters. There's a Democrat running for attorney general here named Jen Jordan, and after this draft leaked, she sent off a tweet calling Georgia the next battleground for reproductive freedom. JEN JORDAN: This was not going to be front and center, obviously. You know, we were talking about pocketbook issues and consumer protection and voting and all that kind of stuff. But sometimes you don't pick the fight; the fight picks you. GRINGLAS: One more voice to bring in - Jeanna Kelley. She just signed up to volunteer with Jordan's campaign, spurred by this news, and she's already done a shift texting women voters. JEANNA KELLEY: I can't do anything else about this but vote and encourage other people to vote. But it really did feel good to be able to connect with women and say, hey, you know, we would love to have you join us in supporting this candidate. GRINGLAS: We don't know how much overturning Roe would actually move the needle come Election Day. You know, persistent inflation or some other issue could totally outweigh everything else in the end. MART\u00cdNEZ: Yeah, sure. How are Republicans, actually, responding in Georgia? GRINGLAS: Let me just play you some tape from this week's Republican debate for lieutenant governor. All the candidates on stage were asked if they're satisfied with the restrictive abortion rules Georgia has already passed or whether they would want to do more. Here's what they said. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"ATLANTA PRESS CLUB\") JEANNE SEAVER: I would love to ban abortion. BRAD MEANS: Just ban it. SEAVER: Yes, sir. MEANS: And, Mr. Miller, your thoughts? BUTCH MILLER: Ban it. MEANS: Ban it. For you, Mr. Jones? BURT JONES: Ban it. GRINGLAS: Republican David Perdue, who is challenging sitting Republican Governor Brian Kemp, says he would pursue an all-out ban, too. Kemp hasn't weighed in on that, but he might feel compelled to call for a total ban as well. That could bite him in November, though, when he needs a broader swath of Georgia voters to keep his seat in office. MART\u00cdNEZ: That's Sam Gringlas, political reporter at WABE in Atlanta. Sam, thanks. GRINGLAS: Thanks. (SOUNDBITE OF THE WAR ON DRUGS SONG, \"PAIN\") MART\u00cdNEZ: All right, turning now to Ukraine, where it's been 71 days since Russia's invasion began. FADEL: And as many since Russia started its assault on the southern city of Mariupol. The last Ukrainian holdouts are trapped in the Azovstal steel plant. Overnight, the remaining soldiers' commander released a video in which he described the situation as dire, but he also said they will continue to resist, even though Russian troops have breached Ukrainian defenses there. Russia says it will commit to a three-day cease-fire, but previous truces have failed. MART\u00cdNEZ: Let's talk to NPR's Brian Mann, who is in Lviv in western Ukraine. Now, more than 150 people have been evacuated from that plant so far. They arrived in Zaporizhzhia, where aid workers assisted with food and supplies. Brian, have there been any new evacuation attempts? And actually, what's the latest on the plan itself? BRIAN MANN, BYLINE: Yeah, those efforts are always underway, but no broader successes so far, A. My colleague Joanna Kakissis said just this morning people are trickling in. They're coming mostly in private cars right now. And heavy fighting there has really prevented aid organizations and the Ukrainian government from establishing a broader cease-fire. One of the Ukrainian commanders at the plant today sent a message saying it's been the second day since the enemy broke into the area of the plant. Heavy and bloody battles are being fought. So the situation clearly is grim there. And Ukrainians, of course, are watching this closely. It's a symbolic part of this war. One other symbolic thing that's happened here - last night, we heard about the death of a well-known Ukrainian journalist. Oleksandr Makhov has been killed. President Zelenskyy paid tribute to the 36-year-old father who also recently proposed to his fiancee from the front lines. Makhov has covered the war in the east for years. He was a veteran soldier. So again, a really key moment for people here, hundreds of Ukrainians sharing stories about him and his character. MART\u00cdNEZ: Brian, you've been looking at how this war is affecting Ukrainian children and teens. What are they telling you? MANN: Well, you know, they're terrified. They're frightened. I've been in front-line city Mykolaiv talking with them. I met one little boy, Arthur, who saw the ceiling collapse in his family's apartment after a missile struck. You know, the Red Cross is trying to help these kids, trying to provide counseling and support, but they're just in a very tough environment. MART\u00cdNEZ: And the U.N. says young people who flee the fighting also face a danger of human and sex trafficking. What have you learned about that? MANN: Yeah, experts and NGOs I've been speaking to are really worried about this. After Russia invaded Donbas in 2014, there was a real crisis then, as young women and girls fled, hoping to find safety and were victimized. Just a few days ago, I met a young woman who was evacuating without her parents because they're needed for the war effort. Nika, who's 17 years old, hopes to reach Poland by herself. Here's what she told me about the danger. NIKA: I read a lot about it 'cause I'm a feminist, so I know a lot about it. And I'm worried about it, too, about all the women that are in danger now. MANN: What Nika told me is that there are just no good answers for people like her during this war. Whether they stay or go, they're in danger. I don't know how to deal with that, she said. So, you know, what we're seeing here, A, is a horrible situation for these young people and, of course, also for their parents. MART\u00cdNEZ: That's NPR's Brian Mann in Lviv. Brian, thanks.

            "article_content": "In times of crisis and upheaval, we've found ourselves especially grateful for music that speaks to the political and social issues of our moment. This year, facing the uncertain future of reproductive rights, turbulent midterm elections, continued climate catastrophe and the ongoing pandemic, we wanted to better understand how artists make music that directly confronts current events. So as part of Turning the Tables, NPR Music's project about the history of popular music, we asked a handful of musicians a question: Who taught you that music could be a vehicle for social change? Below, you'll find links to all the videos we made, featuring six visionary artists: S.G. Goodman, Adia Victoria, Kathleen Hanna, Sadie Dupuis, The Linda Lindas and Moor Mother. They each told us a story about a pivotal musician who taught them that it's possible to write great songs that speak out against injustice and challenge entrenched systems of power. You can watch our video with S.G. Goodman here. \"Hazel Dickens is my No. 1 when it comes to understanding how music can be used to change people's hearts and minds,\" S.G. Goodman tells us. Goodman is a songwriter from western Kentucky who says she's long been an admirer of Dickens' \"high, lonesome sound,\" and the way the bluegrass trailblazer from West Virginia infused her values into her songwriting. \"One thing I love about Hazel Dickens is that in no way was she ever virtue-signaling,\" Goodman says in her video. \"She was on the picket lines. She was an insider to a coal mining family. She wrote about what she knew, and I think that's a really good roadmap for singer-songwriters today, and probably always will be.\" Goodman points to the relationship between Dickens' iconic song \"Black Lung,\" about the disease that afflicts coal miners, and Goodman's song \"The Way I Talk,\" which includes the lyric, \"a sharecropper's daughter sings the blues of a coal miner's son.\" She says she sees similarities in \"the way the world looks at those two types of occupations,\" and how many people \"lack a bit of understanding how people are trying to make a living.\" \"It was powerful for me to make sure the world knows that that's not lost on me when it comes to what my family does for a living,\" Goodman says, \"and it hasn't been lost to people from the coal mining communities either.\" You can watch our video with Adia Victoria here. \"Fiona Apple, in her art, showed me how I could burn the entire world down,\" says Adia Victoria. Victoria first encountered Apple's music when she was 15. \"I heard the song 'Fast As You Can,' and I was stopped in my tracks,\" she says. \"It wasn't quite a poem; it wasn't quite a song; it wasn't quite a stream-of-consciousness. It was all of these things and more. ... [It] was exactly what I needed.\" Victoria's music is rooted in the tradition of the blues, and she considers Apple's music, with its raw honesty and direct confrontation of pain, part of this legacy, too. Victoria specifically mentions her song \"Get Lonely\" \u2014 about \"wanting to get back into yourself after having been thrown out into the world and just reclaiming yourself bit by bit\" \u2014 as having been influenced by Apple's songwriting. Though Apple's music isn't explicitly protest music, Victoria says we ought to think about it in those terms. \"I think of the political as the personal,\" she says. \"It starts in the personal. So much in [Apple's] music is about owning and claiming oneself, even \u2014 and especially \u2014 when that stands in defiance with the main narrative of what a woman should be, what an artist should be.\" Hearing Apple's music \"allowed me to own my gaze and my experience and my own subjectivity,\" Victoria says, \"and I think that's a massive feminist achievement.\" You can watch our video with Sadie Dupuis here. \"Pauline Black taught me that music could be a vehicle for change,\" Sadie Dupuis says. Dupuis plays in the band Speedy Ortiz and makes solo music as Sad13. She says she first heard the music of Pauline Black's band, The Selecter, as a kid, when her parents gave her a compilation from the quintessential ska label 2 Tone Records. Dupuis was impressed by how The Selecter mixed an adventurous sound with the central tenets of second-wave ska, like gender equality and anti-racism. \"That made a big impression on me \u2014 that these songs could carry these important messages,\" she says, \"but also have really weird arrangements that felt very joyful.\" Soon after, Dupuis says, she started writing her own music. \"I've gone a less direct, more poetry-routed way with my lyrics,\" Dupuis \u2014 who is also the author of several books of poetry \u2014 says. But she's still inspired by the way bands like The Selecter were \"really rooted in this history, and responding to it directly, and knew that music could be an important force for getting these kinds of messages across.\" You can watch our video with Kathleen Hanna here. \"Mecca Normal ... made me feel like I could make political music without compromising writing great songs,\" Kathleen Hanna says. The feminist punk icon, known for playing in the bands Bikini Kill and Le Tigre, says she first encountered the Canadian duo \u2014 made up of Jean Smith and David Lester \u2014 in the late 1980s, when she was running a gallery with some friends. Mecca Normal played there as part of its Black Wedge tour, for which Hanna still has the flier; it promises \"five political dynamos, hardcore poems, wild vocals, shredding guitars, radical voices crushing militarism, smashing sexism.\" Hanna says that, at the time, she was used to seeing bands whose songs were about how \"their girlfriends were jerks and didn't do everything that they wanted\" \u2014 but hearing Mecca Normal address real, serious issues in its music was inspiring. Hanna was just starting to make her own music at the time and knew she wanted her songs to confront sexism, but felt unsure of herself. Seeing Mecca Normal, she says, \"gave me confidence that I was on the right road.\" \"When I heard Jean get up there, totally unapologetic,\" she says, \"and I knew that they set up this amazing tour that was based around the combination of music and politics, I felt like: I can do this.\" In her video, Hanna is wearing a T-shirt from a company she founded, Tees 4 Togo, that raises money for girls' education in West Africa. You can watch our video with The Linda Lindas here. \"Alice Bag taught us to make music that's true to ourselves,\" says bassist Eloise Wong of The Linda Lindas. The teen punk band considers Bag a local legend \u2014 \"a really big part of LA music history and LA music culture,\" says guitarist Lucia de la Garza \u2014 in addition to being a punk singer, activist, writer and, as Wong puts it, \"a doer.\" Wong remembers feeling inspired the first time she saw Bag perform: \"She's making these super catchy songs and they're talking about really important stuff,\" she says, \"and she performs in a way that is so captivating that you just can't help but listen to it.\" The band feels inspired by the way Bag sings about issues like sexism and injustice, and how she lifts up the community around her. Drummer Mila de la Garza mentions how Bag \"always has really cool hair colors and outfits\" \u2014 and that it's meaningful how Bag can \"not only look super cool on stage, but she can sing about really important topics while doing that.\" She cites the song \"77,\" about pay inequality, as just one example. Bag helped The Linda Lindas understand that \"it's OK for us to speak our mind and talk about what we think is not OK,\" guitarist Bela Salazar says. \"To see a woman doing that is very powerful.\" You can watch our video with Moor Mother here. \"Nina Simone taught me to be fearless, to speak my mind,\" says musician Camae Ayewa, aka Moor Mother. \"She taught me that anything is possible.\" Ayewa is a poet and musician from Philadelphia; in addition to her work as Moor Mother, she performs with the groups Irreversible Entanglements and 700 Bliss, is a founder of the Black Quantum Futurism collective and teaches at USC's Thornton School of Music. Ayewa first encounter with Simone's music was via her powerful protest song \"Mississippi Goddamn.\" Ayewa says she was \"completely transfixed\" when she heard the song. \"I honestly just went into the corner and wrote down every word from this song,\" she says. \"It was such an important moment.\" Ayewa was inspired by how \"the stories of women \u2014 particularly women that come from Nina Simone's family [and] Black women from all over the world\" \u2014 were so central to Simone's music. It inspired Ayewa to center those stories in her music as well, and she says her experience with Simone's music has been a \"continual push to get what I honor, what I care about, out into the world.\" Alant\u00e9 Millow produced the videos in this series.

            "article_content": "NPR's Elissa Nadworny talks with Democratic strategist Joel Payne about what the 118th congress will bring and what his party could have done differently in the 2022 midterm elections.  ELISSA NADWORNY, HOST: Tonight or tomorrow or maybe weeks from now, the balance of power in Congress will be decided. And that's something both Democrats and Republicans are already planning for, come what may. So we wanted to hear from strategists on both sides of the aisle about how they hope their parties lead the country in the new year. Elsewhere in the program, we'll speak with a Republican. But now we turn to Democratic strategist Joel Payne, who worked on Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign. Welcome. JOEL PAYNE: Thank you so much for having me. NADWORNY: So what's the temperature of this party today? Like, how confident are Democrats about their chances? PAYNE: Well, first off, your listeners probably know Democrats are famously a little dour and filled with self-doubt, especially on Election Day. I think there are plenty of Democrats who feel like there is a really strong agenda that Democrats have put forward. You look at the Inflation Reduction Act. You look at all the recovery efforts that were made in the first year of the Biden administration - infrastructure, student loan forgiveness, etc. I think that there is a real misalignment in the party between should we be talking about those issues or should we be elevating the democracy issues that we know actually drives enthusiasm with the Democratic base - issues like protecting women's reproductive rights, preventing election deniers and calling out those who are responsible for January 6? I think maybe what a lot of Democrats are experiencing right now is a misalignment between what the office holders and the office seekers are saying and what the base is saying. NADWORNY: Do you think there's anything Democrats could have done better to sell their vision to voters this election? PAYNE: Oh, boy, absolutely. And look; one of the challenges that I think Democrats have that maybe does not get enough credit is it's a pretty diverse coalition. Like, you have a coalition that includes Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Elizabeth Warren and Joe Manchin. So you have a pretty wide spans of people from different backgrounds, from different geographic regions that have different interests that matter to their individual constituencies. How do you speak the same language to all of those people and stay consistent? That's hard. That's the work that Democrats have to do. And I think we could certainly probably do a better job of that, not just this cycle but every cycle. NADWORNY: Can you give me just one example of one thing they could have done better to sell their vision? PAYNE: Oh, sure. I think it took a long time to get to that Inflation Reduction Act. If you remember, that started off as Build Back Better. It was a long, drawn-out public process. I think we know that typically voters, the general public, does not like to see how the sausage is made. I can speak from personal experience. I also - I worked in Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid's leadership office about a decade ago. It took a longer-than-expected time to pass the Affordable Care Act. I'd argue that made that piece of legislation less popular when it was finally passed because it took so long and it was so public. I think the same thing kind of happened with the Inflation Reduction Act. If that was being celebrated Q1 of 2022, as opposed to just a month or two ago, which it was, I think Democrats might have had a different story to tell. NADWORNY: It wasn't a magic piece of legislation that just popped up. Easier to sell when it is. PAYNE: That's right. NADWORNY: Election results - they've been fraught since 2010 election. Are you confident the system is going to hold this time around? PAYNE: I think Democrats typically feel like, the system as it currently stands, there is an opportunity to get it right. I think what worries Democrats is - you know, I talked a little bit about election deniers before. Something like over half of the country is going to have an election denier on their ballot. So if you look at a scenario in 2024 where a lot of these office holders or these offices are held by people who don't believe that the 2020 election was fairly resolved, you have people who essentially just disagree with facts. I think that worries Democrats. So it's less about the election tonight. Yes, there is always a concern about securing the election, but I think going forward, the next cycle or the next two cycles, I think that's what really worries Democrats. NADWORNY: Democratic strategist Joel Payne, thanks for being with us. PAYNE: So good to be with you. Thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV) attends an election event on Tuesday, several days before narrowly winning her race. Nevada Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto narrowly won reelection over the weekend, giving her party control of the U.S. Senate for another two years. She beat Trump-backed Republican Adam Laxalt by roughly 7,000 votes \u2014 a much slimmer margin than in 2016, when she was first elected to the Senate (and notably became the first Latina woman to do so). Their closely watched race was considered a toss-up in the battleground state. Nevada voters also elected a Democrat as secretary of state (over a Republican who baselessly maintained the 2020 election was stolen) and a Republican governor (which makes Gov. Steve Sisolak, who in 2018 was elected the first Democrat in more than two decades to represent the state, the only incumbent governor to lose so far in 2022). Loading... This election shows that every vote counts, says Cortez Masto, who campaigned on women's reproductive rights. She recalls her grandmother, the oldest of 13 children, who would walk to her local polling place even when she could no longer drive because she knew how important it was to exercise that right and make her voice heard. \"Their vote is their voice,\" she says of today's voters, especially those who don't believe their vote really counts. \"In a community that still is only 3 million people ... you have the ability to make a difference and who you are going to elect, that will either stand with you or against you and take away your rights.\" Cortez Masto says that's particularly true in Nevada, where races are \"always competitive and ... always close.\" She describes Nevada as a purple state, since 15 of its 17 counties are rural and vote Republican. People assume it's blue, because \"we've done a really good job of electing Democrats here,\" she says. \"To me and most Nevadans, this is not about blue or red,\" she adds. \"This is about fighting for Nevada families and working families and standing up with them and making sure that not only do you understand them, but you're willing to take on those challenges that they're dealing with to make their lives a little easier.\" She spoke to Morning Edition host A Mart\u00ednez about the challenges that her constituents \u2014 and her party \u2014 are facing in her home state. This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity. On whether her narrow win suggests trouble for Democrats in Nevada One thing I know about Nevada, growing up here, is that there are always competitive races and you can't take any Nevadans for granted. And that's why it is important to get out and talk to voters and listen to them about the issues and make sure they understand that you're there not only to fight for them, but you get it. You get their challenges. For me, as somebody who's third-generation, whose family came out to work in the hospitality industry here in Nevada, I understand it. On how her record has helped Nevada The work that I was able to already do, from the bipartisan infrastructure package \u2014 that addresses some of the issues we're dealing with, from drought to wildfires \u2014 to bringing broadband to so many of our unconnected communities in this state, to the CHIPS and Science Act ... and then the Inflation Reduction Act, making sure that we are taking care of individuals so that they can afford their health care, including their medications, capping the cost of insulin, lowering energy costs for families. Those are things that not only did we get done, I was able to talk to Nevadans about and let them know, look, that this is a comprehensive approach to helping families. On what's next for the Democratic party Do we still have work to do? Absolutely. Listen, a gallon of gas here in Nevada is still high ... And I see it. I'm frustrated by it, because I fill up my gas tank and so many of my family and Nevadans do. And our housing costs are still too high. We still have more work to do to help families and lower those costs. And do I have ideas about that? Absolutely. I have legislation around it. And that's what that's what Nevadans are looking for. They're looking for solutions. This interview was conducted by A Mart\u00ednez, produced by Julie Depenbrock and edited by Ally Schweitzer.",

Carolyn Maloney and Jerrold Nadler, Democrats who have each served 30 years, will face one another in New York's new 12th district, based entirely in Manhattan.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: In New York today, two members of Congress who have each served 30 years are running against one another because of redistricting. They've been friends and allies for decades, but the race for the seat in the 12th District has turned into a bitter primary fight. Zach Hirsch has the story from New York City. ZACH HIRSCH, BYLINE: Carolyn Maloney and Jerry Nadler have supported a lot of the same policies. They're both from Manhattan, both popular with liberals. But now, in an unusual second primary of the summer, people have to choose. - Upper East Side or Upper West Side. MARY BARTO: I'm going to vote for Jerry Nadler (laughter). I'm an Upper West Sider. He's our guy. He's our guy. HIRSCH: Mary Barto stopped by a rally for the congressman over the weekend. She says it's terrible she has to make that choice. But Jerry Nadler supports women, she says, and that's the most important thing to her. But it's also meaningful that he's Jewish. BARTO: Certainly, Jewish people are being singled out, attacked. I think it's important. You have to know what it's like to be attacked like that from the inside. HIRSCH: New York has the world's largest Jewish population, aside from Israel. But Nadler is the city's only Jewish representative in the House. That was not a deciding factor for any of the voters interviewed for this story, though, and it's not really Nadler's main pitch. JERRY NADLER: Our democracy is in peril. We have a Republican Party that is openly and proudly insurrectionists. HIRSCH: Nadler has been talking about his role leading the impeachment hearings of former President Donald Trump, and he argues that he's more progressive than Maloney, pointing out a handful of times when he voted to her left. NADLER: I voted against the Iraq War. She voted for it. I voted against the Patriot Act, which was, you know, wholesale surveillance. She voted for it. I voted for the Iran deal. She voted against it. HIRSCH: Bob Liff, a spokesman for Maloney, said the congresswoman listened to intelligence analysts and community leaders, particularly from the Jewish community, on the Iran deal. There were parts of the Patriot Act she did not approve of. And she would not have voted for the Iraq War if she knew then what she knows now, Liff said. For her part, Maloney's pitch is about reproductive health care and women's rights. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CAROLYN MALONEY: You cannot send a man to do a woman's job. HIRSCH: Maloney has represented the Upper East Side for decades. She says she's been more effective, bringing billions of dollars into the district for big infrastructure projects like the Second Avenue subway. But identity comes up a lot in her campaign. Maloney points out that she's the only woman in the house representing Manhattan, and for her supporters, that matters. ALEXANDRA STILLMAN: The majority of Congress is comprised of men, and I think that we need at least one woman from Manhattan to represent us. HIRSCH: Alexandra Stillman can't vote yet. She's 15, but she's volunteering for Maloney, handing out flyers outside a fancy cosmetics store right alongside the congresswoman herself. MALONEY: Well, it's good to see all of you. Thank you for coming out. HIRSCH: Maloney talks about the Supreme Court that has, quote, \"bulldozed women's rights into the ground.\" Here's the congresswoman. MALONEY: My daughter's here. I never thought that I would have my daughter have less rights than the rights that I had when I was her age. We need to reverse that. And only women fight hard as hell for other women. HIRSCH: There's also a third candidate running. Suraj Patel used to work as an aide for former President Barack Obama. He came within 4 percentage points of beating Maloney back in 2020. Now he's hoping to unseat both incumbents in an upset. The winner is expected to take the House seat in November, since the district leans so heavily Democratic. But no matter the outcome, Democrats will lose at least one of their senior leaders in Congress. For NPR News, I'm Zach Hirsch. Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Mary Miller, R-Ill., as she raised her hands to lead the crowd in Mendon, Ill., in applause. Rep.

Miller's rally with Trump on Saturday comes just days before she faces a primary election against the more moderate Rep. Rodney Davis, another Republican incumbent. Their districts in Illinois were recently redrawn by the Democrat-controlled state legislature, pitting the two against each other. The winner of their primary is all but assured a victory in November \u2013 as 68% of the new district's voters picked Trump in 2020. The campaign has been called a test of the power of Trump's endorsement. The vote will take place Tuesday. Miller was elected in 2020. Shortly after she took office in January 2021, she apologized after quoting Hitler in a speech. \"I sincerely apologize for any harm my words caused and regret using a reference to one of the most evil dictators in history to illustrate the dangers that outside influences can have on our youth,\" she wrote then.",

While most U.S. adults favor some restrictions on abortion, according to our new poll, most also say they do not support overturning Roe v. Wade. About two-thirds of Americans say they do not support overturning Roe v. Wade, the landmark Supreme Court decision that made abortion legal in the United States, according to the latest NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll. Seven-in-10 U.S. adults, however, say they are in favor of some degree of restrictions on abortion rights. That includes 52% of Democrats. The issue of abortion rights was once again thrown into the hot spotlight of American politics after the unprecedented leak of a draft opinion from the Supreme Court earlier this month that showed the majority-conservative court ready to overturn Roe. Loading... The draft decision \u2014 which could differ from how the court ultimately rules \u2014 is having an impact with voters, according to the survey. It has fired up Democrats, who had been less enthusiastic about the midterm elections than Republicans, who are favored to take back control of the House and possibly the Senate. The poll shows that two-thirds of Democrats say the contents of the leak make them more likely to vote in November, as compared to just 40% of Republicans who said so. \"It definitely has them [Democrats] focused as no other issue in the recent months has,\" said Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist Institute for Public Opinion, which conducted the poll. \"And to have a gap of that magnitude over the Republicans is something that, at this point, should not go unnoticed.\" The survey of 1,304 adults, including 1,213 registered voters, has a margin of error of +/- 3.9 percentage points when adults are referenced and +/- 4.1 percentage points when referring to voters. That means results could be about 4 points higher or lower. The poll was conducted from May 9 to 13 by live interview callers, who reached respondents via cell phone and landline in English and in Spanish. Democrats also got a boost on which party Americans want to control Congress. By a 47%-to-42% margin, this survey showed voters would cast their ballot in favor of a Democrat in their local congressional district if the election were held today. For Democrats, that is a net increase on the so-called congressional ballot test of 8 points from last month's survey, when 47% said they would vote for a Republican, as compared to 44% who said they would vote for a Democrat. Those numbers were within the margin of error, but it was the first time in eight years that Republicans had done that well on the question in the Marist poll. The question is whether this spike for Democrats lasts. Miringoff sees reason to believe it might. \"My sense of it is that this is not going to be one of those issues that shows up and vanishes soon thereafter,\" he said, \"because so many of the states are going to then have the key decision making role in what the policy is within their jurisdiction.\" Some cold water on these numbers, though \u2014 these are national figures, and control of the House isn't determined nationally, but in battleground districts. And Democrats acknowledge Republicans have the advantage there. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has been circulating its latest internal battleground districts poll among the party's House members. Conducted before the Supreme Court leak, it showed a generic Republican beating a generic Democrat by a 47%-to-39% margin in battleground districts. The survey was first reported by Punchbowl News and confirmed by NPR. A Democratic official says their polling also shows Democratic House incumbents are averaging about 5 points better than a generic candidate, however. Undoubtedly, though, with inflation remaining high, President Biden's standing is weighing down Democratic candidates across the country. Biden's approval rating in the new NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist survey ticked back down to 39%, though it's notable that a generic Democrat is outperforming Biden in the NPR survey. (That comes mostly from Democrats \u2014 more of whom say they would vote today for a Democrat in their congressional district than approve of the job Biden is doing.) The leak had another impact \u2014 hurting the credibility of the Supreme Court as an institution. Just 40% said they had a great deal or quite a lot of confidence in the court, down 17 points from 2018, the last time Marist asked the question. A quarter of respondents said abortion should be available at any point during a pregnancy. That's up from 18% in 2019. Just 9% said it should never permitted, which is unchanged from 2019. But then there's the very gray middle \u2014 about 1-in-5 favor allowing abortion in the first three months only; another 13% say it should be allowed in the first six months; another quarter say it should be allowed only in cases of rape, incest or to save the life of the pregnant person; and 10% say it should be allowed only to save that life. Loading... Big majorities support the following changes to state laws: Big majorities oppose the following: Americans are split on 15-week bans and allowing prescription drugs that induce abortions mailed to homes. When it comes to a 15-week ban, except for medical emergencies or when something is severely wrong with the fetus, people are split, with 49% opposing and 48% supporting it. A slim majority of Republicans support the ban (53%), while a majority of Democrats oppose (57%). And independents are split at 49% to 46% supporting one. On mailing abortion-inducing prescription drugs, 51% say they oppose allowing that, while 47% support it. There's a huge partisan divide here with 7-in-10 of Democrats in favor and 8-in-10 Republicans opposed. A majority of abortions actually take place early on in a pregnancy with the use of medication, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a pro-abortion rights group that tracks abortions. It also notes that overall nearly 9-in-10 abortions take place in the first three months of a pregnancy.",

In a new congressional district in Oregon, House Democratic candidate Carrick Flynn is a virtual unknown and political novice drawing millions of dollars from curious sources. The 35-year-old Oregonian recently laughed off rumors he was bought by a shadowy puppet master. \"It's a fun story, right? It's like, 'Oh, here's this, like, secret thing that's happening: They're buying a congressman,'\" Flynn recently told Oregon's The Bridge by OR360 podcast. Loading... Flynn has become a controversial figure in one of the country's most expensive and bitter Democratic primaries in Oregon's 6th Congressional District. The new, blue-leaning district has seen party infighting, mysterious ties to cryptocurrency and a complaint to the Federal Election Commission. It's also raised questions of race for the district, which claims the state's highest percentage of Latino residents at around 21 percent. It was added after the 2020 Census to serve a region southwest of Portland that includes vast wine country and the state capital of Salem. Next week, voters will pick a winner from a crowded field of nine candidates \u2014 five men and four women \u2014 spending more than $18 million to face off against the winner of the Republican primary. That race has seven candidates facing long odds in a state that has not elected more than one Republican at a time to the House in nearly 30 years. The race has made for the third most expensive House Democratic primary in the country, according to the nonpartisan, nonprofit group OpenSecrets. By Monday, the Democratic race drew more than $13 million in outside money, OpenSecrets reported. The vast majority of that \u2014 more than $10 million \u2014 was donated to Flynn's campaign by a group backed by a cryptocurrency billionaire. And in a rare move, a political action committee, or PAC, tied to top House Democrats such as Speaker Nancy Pelosi spent nearly $1 million to support Flynn. \"It's very surprising to see that type of money fly into Oregon in a race like this that in many ways seems so obscure nationally,\" said Richard Clucas, a professor who has taught political science at Portland State University for the last 27 years. It is also unusual for a candidate with little to no political experience to raise this amount of funds. Records show Flynn has voted only twice in Oregon. \"One has to wonder what's going on,\" Clucas said, \"and why these outside forces have decided to contribute to one of the candidates in that district.\" The race in the neighboring redrawn 5th District has also attracted a ton of outside money, much of it for incumbent Democratic Rep. Kurt Schrader who is facing a primary challenge from Jamie McLeod-Skinner. For Flynn's part, he laughingly described a recent tweet featuring him as a \"Manchurian candidate,\" a reference to the film by that name in which a politician is programmed to follow the directives of his puppet master. \"They took like a poster for 'The Manchurian Candidate' and they made like, they had, like, Sam's head on it\" and Flynn \"on this, like, thing, and like, 'Oh, he's Manchurian candidate,'\" Flynn told the Oregon Bridge podcast. \"I think it's hilarious. Like, you know, I'm going to... print that out and put it on my wall.\" \"Sam\" refers to Sam Bankman-Fried, a 30-year-old American cryptocurrency billionaire based in the Bahamas. His political group's more than $10 million donation is considered an astronomical figure for a House Democratic primary. The PAC backed by Sam Bankman-Fried, founder and CEO of FTX, has donated more than $10 million to Flynn's campaign.\n                \n                    \n                    Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption The PAC backed by Sam Bankman-Fried, founder and CEO of FTX, has donated more than $10 million to Flynn's campaign. Flynn, a Yale University grad and government contractor who moved back to his home state during the pandemic, says his expertise is in artificial intelligence and pandemic preparedness, an issue that is of interest to Bankman-Fried and his PAC. But some are saying Bankman-Fried has gone beyond interest to involvement. One of Flynn's Democratic opponents, tech engineer Matt West, filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission, claiming Flynn and Bankman-Fried were colluding, breaking a law that bans outside groups from coordinating with candidates. Flynn spokesman Christian Sinderman slammed the accusation, saying the two have never met and their connection is very limited. \"We would argue that it's all benevolent and that we're talking about pandemic preparedness,\" Sinderman said. \"So there's no collusion. There's no relationship. This is all fabricated. You know, tactics by opposition. And really, this race is about the future and about the people of Oregon.\" A spokesman for the Bankman-Fried-backed PAC, which is called Protect Our Future, also slammed the accusations of inappropriate contact. Rather, the spokesman said the PAC's focus was on avoiding more pandemic failures, such as those seen under previous elected officials, and they see Flynn as a champion in such efforts. Flynn grew up in the Northwest Oregon town of Vernonia before his family lost its home in a flood. He later won a college scholarship followed by travels around the world. During the pandemic, he moved from Washington, D.C., to McMinnville in the heart of Oregon's wine country. Dr. Kathleen Harder, a Democrat running against Flynn, says the campaign has lost oxygen that should instead be focused on women's reproductive rights as the Supreme Court appears set to overturn the landmark Roe v. Wade case. \"It's really upsetting that the amount of money is taking away from some of the bigger conversations that we should be having,\" Harder said. Another Democratic primary candidate, Cody Reynolds, said the race could inspire billionaires everywhere to buy local candidates. \"If Carrick Flynn wins this race, democracy is dead,\" Reynolds told NPR. Reynolds, who also dabbled in cryptocurrency as an investor, says he's self-funded his own campaign to the tune of $2.7 million. \"This is the test case, right? This is the 'Can I buy my friend a seat and have them vote for me or vote in my interest?'\" Reynolds asked. \"This is where our democracy has ended up. And it's disturbing to me.\" Bankman-Fried co-founded FTX, one of the largest crypto exchanges in the world recently featured in a Super Bowl ad and the namesake of the Miami Heat basketball team's home arena. Bankman-Fried has said he's drawn to \"impressive people\" working on issues of artificial intelligence and pandemic preparedness \u2014 which overlap with Flynn's interests as well. \"Another way that that one has impact is by helping to fund some of these causes,\" Bankman-Fried recently told Forbes. \"That's what I've been doing.\" Bankman-Fried said he believes in effective altruism, the philosophy to maximize financial gifts, and says he's on a mission to give his fortune away. His PAC has also funded a few Democratic primary candidates. For example, the PAC sent $2 million to Georgia Rep. Lucy McBath, who is facing off against House colleague Rep. Carolyn Bourdeaux after the state's redistricting shifts. But by far, Protect Our Future has sent the most Flynn's way and counting. It's helped flood Oregon's 6th with Flynn's television ads and campaign mailers. \"It certainly makes some people very angry,\" Clucas said. \"Money doesn't buy victory, but it can buy name recognition.\" Bankman-Fried has previously donated to President Biden's campaign and other Democrats. He's also made recent appearances in media and on Capitol Hill. On Thursday, Bankman-Fried is slated to testify before the House Agriculture Committee as lawmakers ramp up their look at regulating crypto. In a brief emailed comment to NPR, Bankman-Fried declined to elaborate on his motivation in supporting Flynn. \"Pandemics are bad; preventing them is good!\" he said. Less than a handful of times in recent years, has the powerful House Majority PAC, which is backed by Pelosi and other leaders in the lower chamber, endorsed a candidate in a Democratic primary. It broke with that tradition again when it gave Flynn more than $939,000 this election cycle. PAC Communications Director CJ Warnke said it's doing \"whatever it takes\" to keep the House under Democratic control. \"We believe supporting Carrick Flynn is a step towards accomplishing that goal,\" Warnke said in a statement. \"Flynn is a strong, forward looking son of Oregon who is dedicated to delivering for families in the 6th District.\" But that support has raised more questions. \"Usually the party organizations and groups related to party organizations don't become involved in primaries,\" Clucas said. \"And here, all of a sudden, one is involved in primaries and giving to a candidate who is not well known.\" 6th District Democratic candidates appear before the media in Salem, Ore., on April 12, 2022, to denounce the House Majority PAC's support for Flynn.

From left: Andrea Salinas, Loretta Smith, Cody Reynolds, Kathleen Harder and Matt West. The move quickly triggered six of Flynn's opponents to hold a press conference to slam the move. \"If felt like a slap in the face,\" Oregon State Rep. Andrea Salinas, the frontrunner in the 6th's Democratic primary, told NPR. The campaign arm for the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, known as the Building Our Leadership Diversity, or CHC BOLD PAC, had already backed Salinas to the tune of nearly $1 million. With a high concentration of Hispanic residents, the Latina lawmaker and former staffer for the late Nevada Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has drawn more than 90 endorsements. Still, Salinas noted, recent internal polling shows her leading Flynn by 4 points, \"a statistical dead heat.\" \"He has been up with ads for like 12 weeks... and I just went up on air about three weeks ago,\" Salinas said. \"So it felt really daunting\" early on. Still, she says her 4-point lead gives her hope. \"It goes to show you that Oregonians cannot be bought,\" she said. \"I'm just really proud of the team that we're building and the support that we're building for something that feels much more Oregonian in nature.\" State Rep. Andrea Salinas, right, the frontrunner in the Democratic primary, said the House Majority PAC's backing of Flynn \"felt like a slap in the face.\"\n                \n                    \n                    Chris Becerra Photography\n                    \n                \nhide caption State Rep. Andrea Salinas, right, the frontrunner in the Democratic primary, said the House Majority PAC's backing of Flynn \"felt like a slap in the face.\" Flynn has had his share of stumbles in the race. Among them, he downplayed protections needed for the spotted owl, a major state issue. He also expressed sympathy for an extremist group known as Timber Unity. That drew a rebuke in a joint statement from several of Oregon's environmental groups. Flynn's spokesman Sinderman said the candidate misspoke in those cases. He argues Flynn is a non-traditional candidate who brings humility to the race. \"This is not someone who looked in the mirror as a young person said, 'I want to run for Congress,' right?\" Sinderman said. \"This is a data-driven, policy wonk who, if anything, is a little awkward in the public sphere and really is doing this out of a sense of obligation and a sense of civic engagement.\" But still, the outside money has kept coming for Flynn. Last month, a dark money group called the Justice Unites Us PAC, claiming to support Asian American and Pacific Islander voters, gave Flynn more than $846,000. Flynn is not Asian and so far he's the only candidate to receive money from the group. In a statement shared by Flynn's campaign, the Justice Unites Us PAC said the candidate \"will be the ally AAPI voters in his district deserve.\" Sinderman acknowledges Flynn is running as a white man in one of the state's more diverse districts, but argues he brings a unique experience of poverty from his youth and travels to impoverished nations as an adult. This, as Oregon's 6th Democratic primary candidates features four women, three of whom are women of color and have years of experience serving in office statewide or locally. That includes Loretta Smith, a former staffer to Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden and a former county commissioner who is vying to be the state's first African American member of Congress. Smith says the flood of money for Flynn is old hat. \"Well, it plays into the old narrative,\" she said. \"White men, they are put up on a pedestal, with less experience, less education, less elected experience, experience working for a member of Congress \u2014 and all he has to do is to be a white man and he can attract money.\"",

            "article_content": "As the U.S. Supreme Court considers whether to overturn the constitutional right to an abortion, here's a look at abortion rights and access around the world.  MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: If the U.S. Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade, many states will respond by outlawing abortion or passing new restrictions on abortion. And as closely as Americans will be watching, the rest of the world will be, too. The debate over abortion rights is, of course, not only an American debate. Several countries have changed their abortion laws recently in Europe, in Latin America. So we are going to devote these next few minutes to digging in on what factors may be unique to America and what parts resonate overseas to exploring why the possibility that Roe could be struck down is generating so much attention beyond our borders. To do that, I am joined by three NPR colleagues - U.S. political correspondent Mara Liasson, also Rob Schmitz in Berlin and Philip Reeves in Rio de Janeiro. Welcome, you three. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Happy to be here. PHILIP REEVES, BYLINE: Hello. ROB SCHMITZ, BYLINE: Thank you. KELLY: Phil, you start because I gather in Brazil, people are watching this really closely. What has been the reaction there to the U.S. debate? REEVES: There is indeed a great deal of interest in this. There's an election in Brazil in five months' time. Jair Bolsonaro, the current president, is running for a second term. He's far-right wing. He's seen as an authoritarian in the making, and he is a staunch opponent of abortion. The interest around this issue that's being generated in the U.S. is something that he's harnessing. On this issue, many Brazilians agree with him. It's a criminal offense. Abortion is a criminal offense here in Brazil. It's only allowed in certain specific circumstances - for example, when a pregnancy is a result of rape or the mother's life is threatened. And polls suggest that most Brazilians want the law to stay that way. So throwing a spotlight at this time on this highly emotive, highly polarizing issue helps Bolsonaro at a time that he's trailing in the polls. And there's another thing - he's already put two conservative judges on Brazil's Supreme Court. Campaigners for abortion rights say that if he wins a second term, he'll be able to appoint two more, making it harder for future governments to bring change. KELLY: Putting conservative justices on the Supreme Court - this sounds very familiar to Americans watching. Rob Schmitz, hop in here. You cover Germany, but I actually want to start your next door in Poland, which you also cover, because Poland stands out in Europe for very tight abortion restrictions. Explain. SCHMITZ: Yeah, it does. You know, first off, Poland, like Bolsonaro's Brazil, is very Catholic, and it's chipped away at its democratic institutions in recent years. The right-wing nationalist ruling party called Law and Justice has a symbiotic relationship with the Catholic Church, and their voting base are largely churchgoing rural Poles who are very much against abortion. In its seven years in power, the Law and Justice Party has dismantled the country's judiciary and stacked Poland's courts with party loyalists who bring this conservative Catholic right-wing agenda with them to the bench. And with their help, the party has essentially banned abortion. Just like in Brazil, the only scenario when a woman is able to have an abortion in Poland is if she can prove that she's been raped or if the birth will threaten her own life. Poland's Constitutional Tribunal court limited abortion to just these two scenarios in late 2020, and that prompted the largest protests in Poland, in mostly urban Poland, since those that led to the fall of communism decades ago. KELLY: You know, it's so interesting, Mara Liasson, listening to this here in the states because the U.S. appears to be poised to strike down federal legal protection for abortion while Joe Biden, who supports abortion rights, is in the White House, while his fellow Democrats, who largely support abortion rights, control Congress and while American public opinion is with them. A majority of Americans say they want Roe v. Wade to stand. How did we get here? LIASSON: Well, the simple answer is that we have a very large anti-abortion rights conservative majority on the Supreme Court. And the reason we have that is because we have a system in America where the candidate with the most votes doesn't always become the president. And 5 of the 6 conservative justices on the court were nominated by presidents who came into the White House without a majority of votes - Donald Trump and George W. Bush. And in several cases, these justices were confirmed by a majority of senators, but those senators represent a minority of voters because the Senate is also a minoritarian institution, which gives an advantage to small population rural states. Just for example, right now, we have a 50/50 Senate. The 50 Democrats represent 44 million more voters than the 50 Republicans. And our founders designed a system to protect minority party rights, but I don't think they could have imagined that it would get this out of whack. But you're right. Majority public opinion on abortion has been static in the United States for many decades. People support legal abortion with restrictions. The majority wants abortion to be safe, legal and rare. KELLY: Rob, back to Europe - and broaden out from Poland because Poland is quite different from Western Europe, where abortion is legal in most places. SCHMITZ: That's right. Abortion is legal across nearly all of Europe. You know, each country has a range of restrictions based on how many weeks of pregnancy before the termination is illegal. And several countries require waiting periods as well as parental consent in the case of pregnant minors. But for nearly all of Europe, abortion remains legal, and there are only a handful of countries like Poland that have nearly banned it. KELLY: Phil, what about the rest of Latin America? I mean, there has been movement in other countries to change laws to make abortion more accessible. Bring us up to speed on what is happening in Colombia, in Argentina, in Chile. REEVES: Well, there've been some radical changes in these countries - changes that would have been inconceivable a few years ago. Colombia's constitutional court this year legalized abortion within the first 24 weeks of pregnancy. And in late 2020, Argentina's Congress voted to legalize in the first 14 weeks. And in Chile, which had a total ban on abortion until 2017, abortion rights are now included in a new draft Constitution that's being drawn up by a people's assembly. That document must be approved by a mandatory popular vote, so we don't know whether it'll pass or not. But these are radical changes. Many thousands of women's rights activists, the so-called green wave groups in Latin America, campaigned for years, even decades, to bring about these changes. But now I'm seeing some of them expressing concerns that these developments in the U.S. will inspire anti-abortion groups, which are already very strong in their countries, to try even harder to reverse them. KELLY: Let me bring us back and land on the situation here in the U.S. Mara, where do you see this going with the midterms, with national elections here coming up in just six months? LIASSON: I think where it might have the biggest effect is in Senate races. Swing-state Republican Senate candidates are going to have new challenges. As long as Roe was the law of the land, they didn't have to say whether they were for or against all of these new laws that Republican state legislators are talking about. Some of them are trigger laws. They go into effect automatically. As soon as Roe is gone, some states will have no abortion with no exceptions for rape, incest or health of the mother, life of the mother. There are other laws proposed that would ban IUDs, that would give embryos the rights at the moment of fertilization. Even Mitch McConnell told USA Today this weekend that a national law banning abortion is a, quote, \"possibility\" if Republicans get power. So I think the next big debate in America is going to be about which party can be painted as the extremists on this issue because America - majority of American voters favor a middle ground of legal abortion with restrictions. And that's going to be the fight between the two parties. KELLY: We've been speaking with NPR's Mara Liasson in Washington, with Philip Reeves in Brazil and Rob Schmitz in Germany. Thank you.

From a group photo of the justices at the Supreme Court.\n                \n                    \n                    Erin Schaff/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption These conservative Supreme Court justices overturned Roe v. Wade. From a group photo of the justices at the Supreme Court. For decades, nominees to the Supreme Court have had to answer questions about Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 ruling that, until now, guaranteed the right to abortion in the U.S. That includes the six conservative justices who have now overturned Roe, ending the right to an abortion. A draft opinion leaked in May on the case at hand \u2014 Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization \u2014 prompted accusations that some justices lied in their confirmation hearings. \"Several of these conservative Justices, who are in no way accountable to the American people, have lied to the U.S. Senate,\" two Democratic leaders wrote after the initial leak, calling the reported decision to overturn Roe \"an abomination, one of the worst and most damaging decisions in modern history.\" As nominees, those justices consistently avoided direct statements about Roe, including whether they'd vote to overturn it. Instead, they often commented on the importance of precedent and constitutional guarantees to privacy. Here's what each of the court's five conservative justices said about the case at their confirmation hearings: Samuel Alito on the second day of his Supreme Court confirmation hearing in January 2006.\n                \n                    \n                    Mark Wilson/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Samuel Alito on the second day of his Supreme Court confirmation hearing in January 2006. \"Roe was egregiously wrong from the start,\" Alito writes in the draft opinion. Alito came to his nomination by President George W. Bush with years of experience as a federal judge. In his judicial career, he ruled several times on cases related to abortions, typically in favor of restricting them. During his confirmation hearing, which took place in January 2006, Alito declined to say much directly about Roe. He called it an \"important precedent of the Supreme Court\" but stopped short of calling it settled law. \"Roe v. Wade is an important precedent of the Supreme Court. It was decided in 1973, so it has been on the books for a long time,\" he said. \"It is a precedent that has now been on the books for several decades. It has been challenged. It has been reaffirmed. But it is an issue that is involved in litigation now at all levels.\" Pressed by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., on whether the issue of Roe had been settled by the court, Alito again refused to answer directly. \"It would be wrong for me to say to anybody who might be bringing any case before my court, 'If you bring your case before my court, I'm not even going to listen to you. I've made up my mind on this issue. I'm not going to read your brief. I'm not going to listen to your argument. I'm not going to discuss the issue with my colleagues. Go away \u2014 I've made up my mind,' \" he said. \"That's the antithesis of what the courts are supposed to do, and if that's what settled means, then I think that's not what judges are supposed to do.\" Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas during his September 1991 confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n                \n                    \n                    J.

During his confirmation hearing in 1991, Thomas refused to state an opinion on abortion or whether Roe had been properly decided. Doing so could compromise his future ability to rule on cases related to Roe, he said. (\"I can say on that issue and on those cases I have no agenda. I have an open mind, and I can function strongly as a judge.\") \"I think those of us who have become judges understand that we have to begin to shed the personal opinions that we have. We tend not to express strong opinions so that we are able to, without the burden or without being burdened by those opinions, rule impartially on cases,\" he said. Thomas also said it would be inappropriate for any judge, including himself, to take a case on an issue \"in which he or she has such strong views that he or she cannot be impartial.\" \"You have to listen. You have to hear the arguments. You have to allow the adversarial process to think. You have to be open. And you have to be willing to work through the problem. I don't sit on any issues, on any cases that I have prejudged. I think that it would totally undermine and compromise my capacity as a judge,\" he said. Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, asked Thomas about the dangers of illegal abortions, \"the kinds of abortions where coat hangers are substitutes for surgical instruments.\" Thomas responded: \"If a woman is subjected to the agony of an environment like that, on a personal level, certainly, I am very, very pained by that. I think any of us would be. I would not want to see people subjected to torture of that nature.\" Neil Gorsuch testifies during the third day of his Supreme Court confirmation hearing in March 2017.\n                \n                    \n                    Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Neil Gorsuch testifies during the third day of his Supreme Court confirmation hearing in March 2017. Gorsuch was then-President Donald Trump's first nominee to the Supreme Court, chosen after Trump vowed during his presidential campaign to put \"pro-life justices on the court\" with the explicit goal of overturning Roe. During Gorsuch's confirmation hearing in early 2017, he refused to take a position on Roe. He told Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., that he \"would have walked out the door\" had Trump asked him to overturn Roe. Gorsuch took the uncontroversial line that Roe is a precedent. Precedent is the \"anchor of law,\" he said. \"It is the starting place for a judge.\" \"I would tell you that Roe v. Wade, decided in 1973, is a precedent of the United States Supreme Court. It has been reaffirmed,\" he said. \"A good judge will consider it as precedent of the U.S. Supreme Court worthy as treatment of precedent like any other.\" One telling exchange came with Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., who asked about a book Gorsuch wrote in 2006 advocating against legalizing assisted suicide. In the exchange, Gorsuch acknowledged that the Supreme Court had held that a fetus is not a person for the purposes of the 14th Amendment's due process clause, a legal underpinning of Roe v. Wade. \"Do you accept that?\" asked Durbin. \"That is the law of the land. I accept the law of the land, senator, yes,\" Gorsuch replied.

With Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg then still alive in 2018, Kavanaugh was seen as the potential deciding vote on a future case challenging Roe. He was asked repeatedly, by Democrats and Republicans alike, to comment on the decision and how he might rule. \"Judges do not make decisions to reach a preferred result. Judges make decisions because the law and the Constitution as we see them compel the results,\" he said in his opening remarks. In particular, much was made of a private meeting between Kavanaugh and Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, who said the nominee had told her he considered Roe to be \"settled law.\" But Kavanaugh stopped short of repeating that line in his hearing, instead focusing on Roe's status as Supreme Court precedent. \"It is settled as a precedent of the Supreme Court, entitled the respect under principles of stare decisis,\" he said. \"The Supreme Court has recognized the right to abortion since the 1973 Roe v. Wade case. It has reaffirmed it many times.\" Additionally, Kavanaugh said it can be appropriate for the court to revisit prior decisions. \"I listen to all arguments,\" he said. \"You have an open mind. You get the briefs and arguments. And some arguments are better than others. Precedent is critically important. It is the foundation of our system. But you listen to all arguments.\" Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett testifies before the Senate Judiciary Committee in October 2020.\n                \n                    \n                    Pool/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett testifies before the Senate Judiciary Committee in October 2020. Barrett was nominated by Trump to fill the seat left by the death of Ginsburg in September 2020. Her confirmation hearing was held in October 2020, just weeks before the presidential election. Like the justices before her, Barrett declined to say outright whether she believed Roe had been correctly decided. \"I can't pre-commit or say, 'Yes, I'm going in with some agenda,' because I'm not,\" she said. \"Judges can't just wake up one day and say I have an agenda \u2014 I like guns, I hate guns, I like abortion, I hate abortion \u2014 and walk in like a royal queen and impose their will on the world,\" Barrett said in response to a question about District of Columbia v. Heller, a landmark Second Amendment ruling. But she added that legal challenges to precedents can make their way through the courts back to the Supreme Court, where major rulings can then be revisited. Perhaps the most revealing moment for Barrett came as she was being questioned by Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., who asked if Barrett considered Roe to be a \"super-precedent.\" Barrett answered by defining super-precedent as \"cases that are so well settled that no political actors and no people seriously push for their overruling.\" \"And I'm answering a lot of questions about Roe, which I think indicates that Roe doesn't fall in that category,\" she said. \"Roe is not a super-precedent because calls for its overruling have never ceased. But that doesn't mean that Roe should be overruled. It just means that it doesn't fall in the small handful of cases like Marbury v. Madison and Brown v. Board that no one questions anymore,\" she added. Supreme Court nominee John Roberts shakes Sen.

Chuck Schumer's hand at Roberts' confirmation hearing in September 2005. Chief Justice John Roberts concurred in the judgment only, and would have limited the decision to upholding the Mississippi law at issue in the case, which banned abortions after 15 weeks. At the time of his nomination in 2005, Roberts was seen by liberals as a threat to Roe, in part because of his work as a Justice Department lawyer in the administrations of Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush. During his confirmation hearing, Roberts repeatedly declined to comment on Roe beyond saying he believed it was \"settled as a precedent of the court.\" For the court to overturn a prior decision, Roberts said he thought it was not sufficient to believe the case had been wrongly decided. The justices would have to consider other factors too, he said, \"like settled expectations, like the legitimacy of the court, like whether a particular precedent is workable or not, whether a precedent has been eroded by subsequent developments.\" \"I do think that it is a jolt to the legal system when you overrule a precedent. Precedent plays an important role in promoting stability and evenhandedness,\" he said then. Some abortion-rights activists have worried that a decision to overturn Roe v. Wade could lead to an erosion of other related rights \u2014 like women's access to birth control, which was first established in a Supreme Court decision called Griswold v. Connecticut. \"I agree with the Griswold court's conclusion that marital privacy extends to contraception and availability of that,\" Roberts said in 2005, adding that he felt \"comfortable\" commenting on the case because \"it does not appear to me to be an area that is going to come before the court again.\"",

            "article_content": "President Biden is set to deliver a prime-time speech on the fight for what he calls \"the soul of the nation,\" reprising a theme he ran on for the November midterm elections.  AILSA CHANG, HOST: President Biden is heading to Pennsylvania tonight, where he will give a rare primetime speech on what the White House calls the battle for the soul of the nation. The speech in downtown Philadelphia is about threats to democracy. It's a return to a message that Biden used in his 2020 campaign. And Biden is expected again to take sharp aim at Republicans tonight. Here to talk about all of this is NPR White House correspondent Franco Ordo\u00f1ez. Hey, Franco. FRANCO ORDO\u00d1EZ, BYLINE: Hey, Ailsa. CHANG: OK. So what else can you tell us about what to expect from the president's speech tonight? ORDO\u00d1EZ: Well, Karine Jean-Pierre, Biden's press secretary, told us to expect the president to speak about how he sees Republican followers of former President Donald Trump as a threat to democracy. Biden says they don't respect the rule of law and that they have refused to accept the results of the election. He calls them MAGA Republicans and says they support a kind of semi-fascism. The president has been more aggressively taking on Republicans in recent weeks, you know, as he did in Maryland last week. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: They refuse to accept the will of the people. They embrace - embrace - political violence. They don't believe in democracy. ORDO\u00d1EZ: You know, it's really quite a shift from his earlier efforts to find compromise with Republicans over the course of much of his first year. CHANG: I mean, but this message, it isn't a new area for him, right? Like, why is he giving this speech now? Is he basically - I don't know - just campaigning for the midterms? ORDO\u00d1EZ: You know, Biden has cited recent events as an example of why fighting for democracy is more important than ever. You know, he's pointed to the suppression of voting rights and threats to abortion and reproductive health care, for example. You know, the White House says this is not political. But, I mean, of course, the midterms are just around the corner. You know, I talked with Doug Sosnik. He was a former adviser to President Bill Clinton. You know, he says Biden was struggling but really changed his momentum recently. DOUG SOSNIK: He was teetering on getting to that point where people just weren't going to pay attention to him and they tuned him out. ORDO\u00d1EZ: You know, that new momentum has come from his legislative wins and concerns about the abortion ruling in the Supreme Court, as well as the ongoing coverage of Trump's legal problems. And Sosnik says people are now more willing to listen, especially independent voters. You know, he specifically cited new polling that shows independents have moved more into the Democrats' camp before the midterm elections. SOSNIK: In a world that's increasingly become bifurcated, I mean, to the center. You know, there's 30% of the people out there who are open, you know, to persuasion. ORDO\u00d1EZ: You know, and he said those are the people who are now probably more willing and interested to hear what the president has to say tonight. And that's part of the reason why Biden is giving this primetime address. CHANG: Well, President Biden's second stop in Pennsylvania, this is his second stop in Pennsylvania in, like, three days, right? And he's going back there again over the long weekend. Can you just explain why there's so much focus on Pennsylvania in particular? ORDO\u00d1EZ: You know, Biden is from Scranton, and Pennsylvania is where he launched his 2020 campaign. And this week has been kind of a kickoff for Biden, who promises to do more campaigning before the midterms. And Pennsylvania is an incredibly important state in those upcoming races. You know, it has competitive House races and a gubernatorial contest and a key Senate race that could help determine control of the Senate. So there's a lot riding on this period. CHANG: That is NPR White House correspondent Franco Ordo\u00f1ez. Thank you, Franco. ORDO\u00d1EZ: Thank you, Ailsa. Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "The elections led to some notable results when it comes to former President Trump's endorsements, Republicans who voted for his impeachment and election deniers.  A MART\u00cdNEZ, HOST: Voters in Kansas have given reproductive rights supporters a victory in the first ballot test of abortion rights since the Supreme Court reversed Roe v. Wade. Kansans who went to the polls yesterday protected abortion rights by rejecting an effort to rewrite the state's constitution. As NPR's Domenico Montanaro tells us, it was one of the most notable results after a day of primary voting in five states. DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Well, it's a huge result. I mean, this isn't California or New York. And in talking to Republican strategists over the last few months, since the Roe decision was overturned by the Supreme Court, they've been concerned about how the Supreme Court's decision would affect the campaigns, you know? This is going to make them raise some eyebrows this morning because this result clearly shows where the energy is on this issue of abortion rights right now. And Republicans were on a glide path to take back the House and, potentially, the Senate. But this has the potential to help Democrats blunt some of those expected GOP gains. And it's partly why we've seen some Senate Democratic candidates, for example, inching ahead in some key places. MART\u00cdNEZ: Let's get to some other results. I know former President Trump has weighed in on a lot of races in these primaries. How did his candidates do this time? MONTANARO: Yeah. Let's start in Arizona. In the key Senate race there, Blake Masters, who had Trump's endorsement, won and will face Democrat Mark Kelly this fall. Masters, a venture capitalist who pushed Trump's policies and his election lies, by the way, he had big financial backing from his friend and mentor, PayPal founder Peter Thiel, who poured millions into this race. In the secretary of state's race, a Trump-backed conspiracy theorist and election denier won the GOP nomination. Mark Finchem is now the sixth election denier across the country to win the Republican nomination for a job that would control election administration in states. Four of those places are in key presidential swing states, A - Michigan, Nevada, New Mexico and now Arizona. And in a big race for governor there - the race is too close to call at this point. Polls had shown Trump's preferred candidate, Kari Lake, also an election denier, well ahead. But only a couple thousand votes now separate her from Karrin Taylor Robson, who had the endorsement of former Vice President Mike Pence. MART\u00cdNEZ: What about Republicans who voted for Trump's impeachment? What were the results with them? MONTANARO: Yeah. There were three Republicans on the ballot who voted for Trump's impeachment after January 6. And so far, one, moderate Republican Peter Meijer, lost in Michigan. The other two, both in Washington state, Jaime Herrera Beutler and Dan Newhouse, are ahead of Republican challengers. But only, you know, about half the vote or so is in there. And we don't expect to see a final result immediately. Meijer's loss is pretty significant, I have to say, because it gives Democrats now a pickup opportunity. This was a district where President Biden won in 2020. And the man who ousted Meijer, John Gibbs, is a former Trump appointee to the Department of Housing and Urban Development. He had Trump's endorsement and is far more hard line than Meijer. It's going to be a real test of whether a Trump candidate can win in a general election in a swing district. MART\u00cdNEZ: What about this test in terms of Trump's weight and support in America today? MONTANARO: Yeah. I mean, Trump clearly has a firm grip on the Republican Party. But he's still highly unpopular more broadly. And that - and, you know, like a district like that one in Michigan, we're going to see how candidates with his policies and backing fare in purple places like Arizona and Michigan. Can a Blake Masters, for example, with hard-right Trump policies, win in Arizona over a more moderate candidate like Democrat Mark Kelly? And this is a hugely important Senate race because of how narrow the control of the Senate is right now, with it being 50/50 with Democrats ahead. Do these election deniers win secretary of state races that used to be won by fairly nonpartisan people when it comes to elections? Pretty big questions ahead this fall. MART\u00cdNEZ: That's NPR's Domenico Montanaro. Thanks a lot. MONTANARO: A, you're welcome. Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.  All rights reserved.

President Biden held a formal bill signing ceremony Monday for the bipartisan gun control bill, which was passed in the wake of the shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas. The bill had been signed into law in late June, but Monday's ceremony was a chance for the president to dig in his heels on gun reform. He emphasized that while the bill is an important step, there's still more work to be done. \"Will we match thoughts and prayers with action? I say yes, and that's what we're doing here today,\" Biden said, but he added that more could be done, including passing a national assault weapons ban. The crowd at the White House for the president's remarks was made up of gun control activists and allies, but not everyone was standing firm with Biden. In the middle of the president's speech, Manuel Oliver, whose son Joaquin was killed at the Parkland school shooting in 2018, stood up and said Biden needed to do more when it came to action on gun violence. \"We've already gone through this for years and years,\" Oliver said. He was escorted away from the event afterward. The incident at the White House Monday highlights the wider tensions Biden faces from some in his party, especially in a tight midterm elections year. A poll from the New York Times/Siena College released Monday puts Biden's approval rating at just 33%. And 64% of Democratic voters say they want someone else at the top of the ticket in 2024. The numbers get worse for Biden among younger voters. For those under the age of 30, 94% said they want a different Democratic nominee in the next presidential election. Guns aren't the only topic which Biden has faced criticism for his less-than-urgent response. Some Democrats have said the president needs to show more anger and passion. \"You have a president who \u2014 his sales pitch to the country was 'I'm going to get out the way' at a moment where the people who are part of his coalition want him to be front and center,\" Joel Payne, a Democratic strategist, told NPR. In the days and weeks after the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, for example, Biden's response was more muted. He faced pressure from Senate Democrats to take more immediate action. \"We can't wait days or weeks to get action for people who today need this kind of care, are sitting in their homes scared to death, worried about their own health, worried about their own economic situation, wondering what the heck they can do. Every day that goes by is one day too many,\" Washington Sen. Patty Murray told NPR the day after the court's decision. It wasn't until the week after the decision that Biden said he'd support abolishing the filibuster in the Senate in order to codify Roe. And it took another week for the president to sign an executive order protecting reproductive rights. Payne says the drawn out response from the White House was not the best move. \"It feels like you're flat-footed because it's being delivered in a staggered fashion over the course of 10 to 14 days,\" he said.",

A brutal heat wave is hitting South Asia.  A MART\u00cdNEZ, HOST: The U.S. Supreme Court appears poised to strike down Roe v. Wade, the precedent that has guaranteed a constitutional right to abortion for 50 years. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: We know this because Politico got their hands on a leaked draft opinion written by conservative Justice Samuel Alito. It shows that a majority of the justices believe Roe should be overturned. Hundreds of abortion rights supporters demonstrated in front of the Supreme Court last night. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE: (Chanting) Abortion is health care. Abortion is health care. Abortion is health care. MART\u00cdNEZ: NPR's Sarah McCammon covers reproductive rights. Sarah, what do we know about this document and what it means? SARAH MCCAMMON, BYLINE: Well, first, I want to be clear that NPR has not independently obtained this document, which is labeled as a first draft. But court watchers say it does appear to be genuine. I talked to Amy Howe, the co-founder of SCOTUSblog, which covers the Supreme Court. She sees no reason to doubt its authenticity. And she says a leak like this is highly unusual. AMY HOWE: I think the justices are going to regard this as an enormous breach. To have this kind of leak not only of the results but the opinion itself, you know, really is extraordinary. MCCAMMON: And that opinion, if the court ultimately issues something similar to it, describes Roe as, quote, \"egregiously wrong from the start\" and says there is no constitutional right to an abortion, so it would allow states to severely restrict abortion, as many have been preparing to do. MART\u00cdNEZ: All right, so there's a lot to react to. What have you seen and heard so far? MCCAMMON: Well, because this is a leaked draft, groups on both sides are being a bit cautious about what they say right now, but the news is certainly reverberating across the spectrum. Steve Aden is with Americans United for Life, which has sought to ban abortion in state legislatures nationwide. He's liking what he's seen so far. STEVE ADEN: It means simply that state lawmakers have to get to work to enact strong state laws and a policy to protect life across the country. MCCAMMON: And, A, some abortion rights opponents are expressing concern about why this leak happened, what might have motivated someone to do it. But of course, we don't know that. We don't know the source or their reasons. And from abortion rights advocates, there's a lot of anger and sadness about what they fear will be the court's decision. And, you know, this comes after months and years, really, of warning against exactly such a potential turn of events. The Women's March, for example, is calling for nationwide protests this evening in response. MART\u00cdNEZ: Are these abortion rights groups at all hopeful that when the Supreme Court has its final opinion that it'll be different? MCCAMMON: You know, I'm not hearing a lot of that kind of optimism. Reproductive rights groups are reminding people that, at least for now, abortion is still legal across the U.S., at least officially, and they're watching to see what the official opinion will say. Now, this is in line with what a lot of people have predicted, that this conservative court with three justices chosen by former President Trump would do. I spoke to Michelle Colon of reproductive rights advocate with SHERo Mississippi, which is where this case originates from. She says access to the procedure is now seriously threatened. MICHELLE COLON: It's the reality - you know what I'm saying? - which we've been preparing for. We're not surprised. This will open up a floodgate to many, many of the other standing, you know, laws that have been argued and won at the Supreme Court in regards to freedoms for Americans. MCCAMMON: She says this will hit lower-income people especially hard but that activists will try to help patients get abortions, whether through travel or, in some cases, abortion pills. MART\u00cdNEZ: And Sarah, assuming these reports are correct, what happens next? MCCAMMON: Well, according to some estimates, more than half of states are poised to ban most or all abortions. And this will be a campaign issue. Groups are preparing to make this an opportunity to catalyze voters in the midterms. MART\u00cdNEZ: That's NPR's Sarah McCammon. Thanks a lot, Sarah. MCCAMMON: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MART\u00cdNEZ: The Supreme Court news may end up influencing voters ahead of the November midterms. MARTIN: Thirteen states are holding primaries this month, and voters in Ohio and Indiana head to the polls today for primaries. Key congressional races are up for grabs. How much weight do former President Trump's endorsements carry in those states? MART\u00cdNEZ: NPR senior political editor and correspondent Domenico Montanaro is watching all of it. So first off, how might this Supreme Court news that we just heard about play into voter turnout this year? DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Well, it really has the potential to be an earthquake in this election. I mean, we're likely to see mass protests from women and men who are in favor of abortion rights. It could fire them up to vote in a year when Democrats are facing enormous headwinds. This is also going to raise the pressure on Democratic congressional leaders to get rid of the filibuster and pass legislation that codifies abortion rights in this country. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer released a statement last night saying the conservative justices have lied to the American people because, during their confirmation hearings, they repeatedly said that Roe v. Wade is precedent and the law of the land. Republicans, by the way, have used the culture war issues to fire up their base. No issue is more central to that than abortion. But our latest NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll - it's worth pointing out - found that Democrats had an 11-point advantage on the question of which party Americans think is better at dealing with abortion as an issue. And an ABC News poll out this week also had similar numbers. So not an outlier there. MART\u00cdNEZ: All right, now to Ohio. What's going on with the key Senate races there? MONTANARO: Yeah, there's a race to replace Republican Senator Rob Portman, who's retiring. Trump has endorsed J.D. Vance over several others who are trying hard for Trump's endorsement. Vance wrote the book \"Hillbilly Elegy.\" But it was a surprise that Trump did this because Vance had been hotly critical of Trump before he became president. Vance has gotten a bump in the polls. But there are lots of undecided voters. Trump's endorsement did not, by the way, go down exactly well with his base. Before it, the top contenders were seen as state treasurer Josh Mandel and investment banker Mike Gibbons. It's been a pretty nasty fight, with Mandel and Gibbons nearly getting into a fistfight, literally, at a debate not that long ago. MART\u00cdNEZ: I saw that. I saw that. MONTANARO: (Laughter). MART\u00cdNEZ: What about - yeah, it was wild. What about the Democrats, then? Do they have a shot in this race? MONTANARO: Well, Ohio's a bit of a longer shot for Democrats than some other places, but they hope that this GOP tension can potentially open up a path for their likely nominee, Congressman Tim Ryan. He's got a pretty centrist profile in Washington. And remember - Ohio used to be a swing state, but that's just not the case anymore. It's trended more Republican, and it is a sign of just where the politics are in this state. When Ryan was asked if he wanted Biden to campaign with him, President Biden to campaign with him, he said that he's running his own race. MART\u00cdNEZ: All right. Now, we mentioned Donald Trump's endorsements. Where else are you watching where his backing might matter? MONTANARO: Well, this month, some pretty key races. We're looking at Pennsylvania and North Carolina, where there are some key Senate races. In Georgia, which is a hotbed of political activity, there's a governor's race and secretary of state race, and there, Trump has endorsed challengers to Republican incumbents, and those challengers have all backed his election lies and attempts to overturn the presidential election there. So lots to watch in the coming month, and it's really going to be a critical month as we kick off these primary elections. MART\u00cdNEZ: That's NPR's Domenico Montanaro. Domenico, thanks. MONTANARO: You're welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MART\u00cdNEZ: Turning now to South Asia, where more than a billion people could face heat-related health problems due to scorching temperatures. MARTIN: The brutal heat wave is what scientists have been predicting for countries that are on the front lines of climate change. April and March were both the hottest in more than a century in India. Some schools have closed early for the summer. Hospitals are on watch for heatstroke. MART\u00cdNEZ: Joining us now from sweltering Mumbai is NPR's Lauren Frayer. Lauren, what are people doing to try their best to cope with the hot and humid temperatures in Mumbai? LAUREN FRAYER, BYLINE: Well, I've got my ceiling fan on, which you can probably hear behind me. MART\u00cdNEZ: Yeah. FRAYER: Thanks for allowing me to keep that on here. The line at my local ice cream parlor was 40 minutes long the other night, if that's any indication. People are trying to hydrate. They're trying to stay indoors if they can. Only a tiny fraction of Indians have air conditioning, though. Instead, people soak rags in water and hang them from doors and windows. Two-thirds of Indians live in rural areas. Many of those folks work out in farm fields or in construction, so literally out in the sun, in the elements all day. MART\u00cdNEZ: I saw 120 over the weekend. I mean, are these extreme temperatures pushing the limits of what folks can survive? FRAYER: Absolutely. And this is not just some threat for the future. This is what's happening right now. At least 25 people died of heatstroke in my state of Maharashtra this year. I talked to Ulka Kelkar. She's an economist and climate change expert. She describes what we're experiencing in humid cities like Mumbai, where I live. ULKA KELKAR: Heat plus humidity. At some stage, it becomes almost impossible for the human body's organs to function normally. Basically, the body just cannot cool itself. FRAYER: So the temperature here in Mumbai is only - only - in the 90s today, but the humidity makes it just as dangerous as those 120 degrees that we're seeing in the deserts of northwest India or in southern Pakistan right now. MART\u00cdNEZ: Now, you mentioned your ceiling fan that we can hear in the background there. FRAYER: Yeah. MART\u00cdNEZ: And I can assume that air conditioners, as much as possible, are being used. How much is this heat pushing up this demand for electricity? FRAYER: So there are rolling blackouts across several Indian states right now, and that's hurting industrial input - output, rather. The government is canceling passenger trains, converting them to cargo for coal. Seventy percent of India's electricity comes from coal. So in the short term, India has no choice but to burn more coal during this heat wave. Of course, doing that exacerbates the warming, which is exactly what we're trying to avoid by running all these fans and AC. So it's a vicious circle. And scientists say we're going to reach a breaking point pretty soon. MART\u00cdNEZ: So these rolling blackouts, these hot temperatures, I mean, are they a sign of things to come with climate change all over the world? FRAYER: Totally. And like I said, it's already happening. I mean, we've covered - you guys have covered people fleeing California because of wildfires. Well, that's happening on a much bigger scale in South Asia. We've got rising sea levels, extreme heat, erratic weather. It impacts the food supply. I mean, what happens when a harvest fails and India has 1.4 billion people to feed? This heat wave right now has hit in the middle of the wheat harvest. The grain is coming out all shriveled. And India was actually hoping to boost grain exports this year to make up the shortfall from the war in Ukraine, and that looks like it might not happen now. MART\u00cdNEZ: NPR's Lauren Frayer.

            "article_content": "A leaked draft opinion published by Politico suggests that earlier this year a majority of Supreme Court justices supported overturning the 1973 case Roe v. Wade that legalized abortion nationwide.  AMART\u00cdNEZ, HOST: President Biden is urging elected officials at all levels of government to protect a woman's right to choose. The president issued that statement after the leak of a draft of a Supreme Court opinion that suggests the justices are poised to overturn Roe v. Wade, the decision that legalizes abortion in the U.S. The president said, quote, \"it will fall on voters to elect pro-choice officials this November. At the federal level, we will need more pro-choice senators and a pro-choice majority in the House to adopt legislation that codifies Roe.\" He also added \"we do not know whether this draft is genuine or whether it reflects the final decision of the court.\" Outside of the Supreme Court last night, hundreds of people gathered in response to the news. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED CROWD: (Chanting) Abortion is health care. Abortion is health care. MART\u00cdNEZ: NPR's Sarah McCammon covers reproductive rights. She joined us to talk about it. SARAH MCCAMMON, BYLINE: Well, I want to say, first of all, A, that NPR has not independently obtained this document, which is labeled as a first draft. But court watchers say it does appear genuine. Amy Howe is the co-founder of SCOTUSblog, which covers the Supreme Court. She says she sees no reason to doubt this document's authenticity. And she says this kind of leak is highly unusual. AMY HOWE: I think the justices are going to regard this as an enormous breach. To have this kind of leak, not only of the results but the opinion itself, is extraordinary. MCCAMMON: And that opinion itself, if the court ultimately issues something similar to this draft, would allow states to severely restrict abortion. It describes Roe v. Wade as, quote, \"egregiously wrong from the start.\" And it says there is no constitutional right to an abortion. MART\u00cdNEZ: So what's the reaction been so far? MCCAMMON: Well, there's both a reaction to the leak and to the content itself. Now, because it's a leaked draft, groups on both sides are being a bit cautious about their reactions. But this news is certainly reverberating across the political spectrum, and it's very much in line with what a lot of groups on either side of this issue have expected. Steve Aden is with Americans United for Life, which has sought to ban abortion in state legislatures nationwide, and he likes what he's seeing so far. STEVE ADEN: It means simply that state lawmakers have to get to work to enact strong state laws and a policy to protect life across the country. MCCAMMON: And from abortion rights advocates, there is a lot of anger and sadness about what they fear will be the court's decision. This comes after months and years, really, of warning against exactly such a potential turn of events. MART\u00cdNEZ: Are abortion rights groups at all hopeful that the Supreme Court's final opinion might be different? MCCAMMON: I mean, they're stressing that this is a draft and it's a leak, but I'm not overall hearing that kind of optimism. Reproductive rights groups are reminding people that, at least for now, abortion is still legal across the U.S., even if very difficult to obtain in many places. And they're watching to see what the official opinion says. As we've said, this is in line with what a lot of people have predicted from this conservative court, you know, with three justices chosen by former President Trump. I talked to Michelle Colon with the reproductive rights group SHERo Mississippi. That's where this case before the Supreme Court originated. She says abortion is now seriously threatened. MICHELLE COLON: It's the reality which we have been preparing for. We're not surprised. This will open up a floodgate to many, many of the other standing, you know, laws that have been argued and won at the Supreme Court in regards to freedoms for Americans. MCCAMMON: And she says this will make abortion access particularly difficult for lower income people and other marginalized groups. But she says reproductive rights groups will try to help patients get abortions through travel or through abortion pills. MART\u00cdNEZ: Now, assuming these reports are correct, what happens next? MCCAMMON: According to some estimates, more than half of states are expected to ban most or all abortions. And this will become even more a political issue, an issue in the midterm elections, certainly. MART\u00cdNEZ: NPR's Sarah McCammon, thanks a lot. MCCAMMON: Thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.

Three Democrats are favored to hold onto their seats  RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: With control of the U.S. Senate at stake, the race in Nevada is too close to call at this hour. We may not know anything until Friday, when tens of thousands of mail-in ballots are expected to be counted. Republican Adam Laxalt has a razor thin lead over the incumbent Democrat, Catherine Cortez Masto. In the House race, one race has been called for a Republican in Nevada. Three Democrats are favored to hold on to their seats, but that could change. Our co-host, A Mart\u00ednez, is in Las Vegas and joins us now. Hey, A. A MART\u00cdNEZ, HOST: Hi. MARTIN: You sound like you are in a place. Where are you? MART\u00cdNEZ: Yes. Yes. We're in an area called Fremont Street Experience. It's an outdoor covered mall with shops, casinos and entertainment. For those who remember the U2 song, \"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For,\" this is where your pal Bono and the band shot the video... MARTIN: OK. MART\u00cdNEZ: ...At this outdoor mall - borders east Las Vegas. Seventy percent of Nevada's Latino voters live here. And leading up to the election, analysts believe that their votes, or actually maybe their lack of votes, Rachel, could determine who controls the state in the U.S. Senate. MARTIN: So you were out visiting polling stations yesterday. What did you hear from voters? MART\u00cdNEZ: Well, much of the elections chatter here was about this perceived enthusiasm gap between Democrats and Republicans. We heard many times that Democrats were slow to engage and Republicans were all fired up. That was certainly the case for Scott Anderson (ph). He's a Republican we met right after he voted. SCOTT ANDERSON: The southern border is a sieve. You know, it's worse than Swiss cheese. The banning of drilling and fracking and just this nonsense of this Green New Deal - these people have to go. MART\u00cdNEZ: Anderson brought a friend with him to the polls, and he said their goal was to stop the Democrats from destroying the country. MARTIN: What did Democrats have to say about that when you spoke with them? MART\u00cdNEZ: Yeah. Well, Democratic canvassers that we spoke to felt like they had two opponents - Republicans and then voter apathy. Jose Luis Verserra (ph) did go out and vote. He was concerned about education. He brought up a theme, though, that we heard from a number of Democrats we talked to. Verserra says that when it's all said and done, he was not convinced his vote counted for much. JOSE LUIS VERSERRA: (Speaking Spanish). MART\u00cdNEZ: And Verserra says, you know that when they win, they forget what they promise. It's just like in Mexico. In Mexico, they promise many things and then they forget. Now, I also chatted with Adam - Alan Gill (ph). He was concerned about women's rights and the economy. Those were the issues that guided how he voted. And I asked him if he thought his vote would have a direct impact on his life. ALAN GILL: Nope. I vote. I've - I served my country. But seeing it affect me personally, no. I don't see it happening. But... MART\u00cdNEZ: Yet you still come out and vote, so you obviously have faith in something. GILL: Oh, yeah, definitely. I always have faith in my country. But your question was, do I see it affecting me personally? No, I don't. MARTIN: But he still obviously takes the responsibility of voting very seriously, even if he doesn't feel it in his own life. Did you talk with people for whom these issues would affect them in their day-to-day? MART\u00cdNEZ: Yeah, absolutely. Kevin Williams. He had a somewhat different perspective. He took a big-picture view here. He's a young Black man who's worried about women's reproductive rights. And he spoke to us while wearing a face mask and says he doesn't know if his vote will have an impact this time around, but he thinks of it as a bit of an investment in future elections. KEVIN WILLIAMS: If I don't vote, then my community is not going to be looked at for advertisements. They're going to be looked at for their own issues the next elections. And so all this is public information. That's how the next year, the next - whatever the situation - next campaign is going to be looking at who voted in it last time 'cause they're more likely to vote again. And so I want to make sure that I'm an advocate for my causes as well, and just to let people know that I'm here. MARTIN: A sampling... MART\u00cdNEZ: Just in case that was tough to hear, yeah, he's saying he wants to know that - he wants everyone to know he's engaged. MARTIN: A sampling of voter voices from the state of Nevada and Las Vegas in particular, which is where we heard from A Mart\u00ednez, our co-host. Thanks, A. MART\u00cdNEZ: No problem.

            "article_content": "Democratic Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema has been facing pushback at home. It all escalated with national groups threatening not to support her over her voting rights and filibuster stances.  AILSA CHANG, HOST: Two Democrats voted with all 50 Republicans last night against changing the filibuster - West Virginia's Joe Manchin and Arizona's Kyrsten Sinema. That vote has doomed the effort to pass voting rights legislation for now, and Sinema's move is giving Arizona progressives yet another reason to seek a primary challenge. Ben Giles from member station KJZZ in Phoenix reports. BEN GILES, BYLINE: Arizona progressives have spent months trying to sway Sinema. Voting rights, they say, is important enough to toss aside Senate rules requiring a 60-vote majority to move forward on legislation. EMILY KIRKLAND: We really are in a situation where our freedom to vote is at stake. GILES: Emily Kirkland is the executive director of Progress Arizona. Unable to change Sinema's mind on their own, Kirkland and dozens of other Arizona Democratic women sent a letter to EMILY's List late last week. It was a call to arms to a national organization focused on electing female Democrats who support abortion rights. KIRKLAND: We're in a moment where, given the threats to our democracy, we can't afford for people and organizations to be staying in their lane and focused only on one issue. GILES: Historically, abortion rights advocates like EMILY's List have resisted calls to change or eliminate the filibuster. As Sinema has argued, the rule's been used in the past to defend women's access to health care. But on Tuesday, EMILY's List issued a statement singling out Sinema - if the senator won't bypass the filibuster for voting rights, she'll lose a valuable ally when up for reelection. It's no hollow threat. From 2015 to 2020, while Sinema was running for the Senate, no one contributed more to her campaign than EMILY's List - over $400,000, according to OpenSecrets. Tony Cani, an Arizona political strategist, said it's not just about the money. TONY CANI: EMILY's List is a very powerful, trusted messenger to Democrats and to pro-choice women. GILES: Other organizations took notice and ramped up their own messaging against Sinema, including NARAL, a national reproductive rights group that said it won't endorse candidates who don't support a path forward for the voting rights bills in the Senate. Threats from national abortion rights groups come on top of months of calls for a Democrat to challenge Sinema in a 2024 primary. The Primary Sinema Project claims it's raised over $300,000 in about three months, with a surge of donations after Sinema last week affirmed her commitment to the filibuster. LUCHA, a group of local Arizona activists who have clashed with Sinema over the past year, issued a statement condemning her for turning her back on Black and brown Arizonans. Co-executive director Alejandra Gomez vowed to oust Sinema in the Democratic primary. ALEJANDRA GOMEZ: I think she is showing the American public and Arizonans very clearly who she is standing with. And she is not standing with voters. GILES: In her own statement, Sinema brushed aside the criticism, chalking it up to honest disagreements over policy and strategy. Strategist Tony Cani said she may have miscalculated. CANI: I think that what she's missing here is that her brand is somebody who gets things done. GILES: Cani said some voters see Sinema as a symbol of obstruction. She did help craft the bipartisan infrastructure law and has made her mark in the Senate working across the aisle. Arizona is a tightly contested state where centrist candidates have found success in general elections. But to win reelection in 2024, she'll first have to survive a primary.

            "article_content": "The constitutional right to abortion ended this year, with clinics closing in states that banned the procedure, and patients who could traveling to states where abortion is allowed.  ALINA SELYUKH, HOST: 2022 saw the overturning of Roe v. Wade, the historic Supreme Court decision that had guaranteed the right to abortion in the U.S. for nearly 50 years. NPR's national correspondent Sarah McCammon covers abortion rights policy, and she has this look back on a history-making year. SARAH MCCAMMON, BYLINE: The year began with high hopes for the anti-abortion rights movement. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JEANNE MANCINI: We are hoping and praying that this year, 2022, will bring a historic change for life. MCCAMMON: In January, March for Life president Jeanne Mancini told activists gathering on the National Mall for their annual rally that she was full of anticipation as the Supreme Court prepared to release its decision in a major abortion case. The court's conservative majority was more powerful than ever, with three justices appointed by former President Trump. Mancini told marchers from around the country that soon the fight would become much more local. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MANCINI: If Roe falls, the battle lines will change. But make no mistake, the fight for life will need to continue in the states and here in D.C. MCCAMMON: Meanwhile, in Texas, the reality of what a post-Roe America could look like was already coming into view. Most abortions had become illegal after the U.S. Supreme Court allowed a state law called SB 8 to take effect a few months earlier, banning most abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy. In a novel legal strategy designed to get around existing precedent, SB 8 empowered individuals to sue abortion providers and others believed to be involved in illegal abortions. The law meant some patients like Anna, a woman from central Texas who suffered a miscarriage in 2021, were denied emergency terminations. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) ANNA: They couldn't even say the word abortion. Like, I could see the fear in these doctors' eyes that they were just so scared to even talk about it. MCCAMMON: In an interview with NPR a few months later, Anna, who asked us not to use her last name for fear of potential legal repercussions for her doctor, said her water broke at 19 weeks, just under halfway through the pregnancy. She and her husband went to an emergency room, where doctors told her there was no chance the baby could survive and that continuing the pregnancy could put her at risk. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) ANNA: You're at a high chance of going septic or bleeding out, and unfortunately, we recommend termination. But we cannot provide you one here in Texas because of this law. MCCAMMON: Anna became one of the first patients facing an abortion ban, but certainly not the last, to get on a plane and travel to another state while in the midst of a medical crisis. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) ANNA: I had to come up with a game plan with my OB in case I went into labor on the flight, and I made sure that I bought us front-row of seats so I could be close to the bathroom in case it happened. And - (crying) like, no one should ever have to do that. MCCAMMON: Then in late June, the U.S. Supreme Court released the Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization decision, sending the status of abortion law into chaos around the country. Some clinics had to shut down with patients still in the waiting room in states with laws designed to quickly ban abortion after the fall of Roe. Reproductive rights lawyers fought back, challenging some of those laws in state courts. In Louisiana, just days after the Dobbs decision. They won a brief reprieve. At the Hope Medical Group for Women in Shreveport, staff members scrambled to keep up with calls from confused and anxious patients. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) STEFFI CHAFFEE: We're back to being able to schedule. What, did you have an appointment with us or what? You mean for your first visit? OK, well, we're not scheduling for first visits right now, honey. We're already booked up. So - well, I understand, honey. The whole thing isn't fair. MCCAMMON: One patient who managed to get an appointment, there was a 27-year-old woman from Texas. She asked us to call her by the letter J rather than her full name for fear of stigma back home. J told me she was struggling as a stay-at-home mom to three young children. And after serious medical complications in previous pregnancies, she was devastated to find out she was pregnant again. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) J: I was really scared. I thought I was going to have to travel 12 hours to Albuquerque because of Roe v. Wade being overturned. I had a panic attack that day. MCCAMMON: That same week in Indiana, Dr. Caitlin Bernard was taking care of a 10-year-old who'd become pregnant as a result of rape. The girl had traveled from neighboring Ohio after a near-total abortion ban with no exceptions for rape or incest took effect there. In an interview with NPR in late July, Dr. Bernard said she was worried about the impact of abortion bans on patients facing a variety of complex pregnancy decisions in an increasingly confusing legal environment. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) CAITLIN BERNARD: When you take away someone's right to privacy about their medical decisions, the challenges that they face to access lifesaving health care is going to be enormous. MCCAMMON: After prominent conservatives questioned Bernard's credibility without providing evidence. The story became a symbol of the fight over abortion access that had been triggered by the Dobbs decision. The state of Indiana eventually produced documents supporting Bernard's version of events. Many anti-abortion rights activists continued to oppose rape exceptions, insisting abortion is always wrong. Pam Whitehead, who lives in Texas and leads the anti-abortion group ProLove Ministries, says her views were shaped partly by her own experiences. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) PAM WHITEHEAD: I can't imagine being in that situation. I know what it's like to be raped, though. I also know what it's like to have an abortion. And I'll tell you this, that that abortion impacted me greatly. MCCAMMON: Around the country, clinics and states where abortion remains legal have been coping with an influx of patients by the thousands determined to get abortions, even if they have to travel out of state. Abortion funds and logistical support networks have stepped in to help with the costs of travel and other needs. LaQuetta Cooper with Planned Parenthood of the Saint Louis region and southwest Missouri, says the influx to Illinois was even bigger than expected. Her affiliate recently announced the launch of a mobile abortion unit that can travel throughout southern Illinois, offering abortion pills and eventually procedures closer to patients in states like Missouri, where abortion is unavailable. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) LAQUETTA COOPER: The biggest needs that we are seeing is the fact that they have to travel so far to get the care that they need. This will be helpful so that they don't have to travel three to five hours trying to get the abortion care that they need. MCCAMMON: Anti-abortion rights groups are taking notice, working to tighten regulations on pills and looking for ways to make it harder for providers to serve patients across state lines. Just months after the Supreme Court overturned Roe, voters had a chance to weigh in. Nationwide, voters in the 2022 midterms listed abortion rights among their top concerns in exit polls. And in several states where the issue was on the ballot, including red states like Kansas and Kentucky, voters signaled support for abortion rights. Already, abortion rights groups say they're looking ahead to future elections, hoping to put the question directly to voters in more states. Sarah McCammon, NPR News, Washington.

The infant formula shortage \"is a life or death issue\" for a lot of babies in the U.S. and a national emergency, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand says. The New York Democrat told All Things Considered that she will ask President Biden to consider using the Defense Production Act to get more manufacturers on line to address the dire situation. Regular and specialized formulas, made for babies with allergies and metabolic disorders, have been running low across the U.S. for some time. Datasembly, which collects information from thousands of sellers, found that in the first week of May the average out-of-stock rate for baby formula at retailers across the country was 43%. Gillibrand said she's heard heartbreaking stories from her constituents. \"Some are having to choose between taking their children to the nearest emergency room just in desperation for formula, or putting their kids on feeding tubes,\" she said. Gillibrand says sellers are preying on vulnerable families and are price gouging. She blamed the shortage on \"corporate greed and malfeasance\" pointing to Abbott Nutrition, which recalled many of its formula products in February due to safety concerns. Abbott issued a voluntary recall that included certain Similac, Alimentum and EleCare formula products. \"They had safety violations,\" Gillibrand said. \"They had a whistleblower who told the FDA about these violations in October of 2021. They didn't take it seriously They didn't do an immediate investigation. \"And it wasn't until February of 2022 that the FDA got their act together and started an investigation. So this has created exacerbated situations because now this whole supply chain has been shut down from Abbott.\" Now, Gillibrand said, \"The current manufacturers are unwilling to produce enough formula because they think it costs too much money. They need to be told they have to double their production immediately. For a lot of these babies this is a life-or-death issue. \" When asked whether the FDA has responded to Congress's concerns, she said the agency had not. \"I would urge investigation of the four major companies that produce formula in this country to see whether they're price gouging, whether there is corporate greed and malfeasance at play, and whether they are willing to increase their production immediately under the Defense Production Act or under just the request of America to protect babies,\" Gillibrand said.",

            "article_content": "The Fed is expected to hike interest rates Wednesday. An Indiana doctor says she's been harassed for giving an abortion to a 10-year-old who had been raped. Russia cuts gas supplies to Europe.  A MART\u00cdNEZ, HOST: The Federal Reserve is expected to announce another big increase in interest rates today. LEILA FADEL, HOST: Prices have continued to rise at their fastest pace in a generation, and the Federal Reserve is trying to get inflation under control. But is it working? MART\u00cdNEZ: NPR's David Gura is here to tell us all about it. David, I think we all expect an interest rate hike. But, David, how high might it be? DAVID GURA, BYLINE: So Wall Street expects an interest rate increase of another three-quarters of a percentage point, which would be a big hike. It would be the fourth hike this year. And we haven't seen moves of this magnitude in decades. It's an indication that this continues to be an economy under pressure from inflation. Now, the Fed's trying to take away the incentive to spend by making the cost of borrowing more expensive. Michelle Meyer is the U.S. chief economist at the Mastercard Economics Institute, and she says the Fed is trying really hard here to strike the right balance. MICHELLE MEYER: They need to push the economy enough in terms of weakening growth to take out some of that price pressure, but not too much where they create damage to the real economy and, you know, threaten recession. GURA: Now, A, this is challenging because the Fed's tools are not precise. This isn't going to be painless, and this goes beyond demand. The war in Ukraine has sent the price of gas and other commodities, like wheat, higher. And then there are supply chain issues, and the Fed can't do much about either of those. MART\u00cdNEZ: I mean, I think what people want to know is, are there signs of - if the Fed's policies are working? GURA: Absolutely. We've seen them cool what was a very hot housing market. The average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is now at about 5 1/2 percent. That's almost double what it was last year. And we've seen demand for those mortgages taper off, along with new home sales and construction. You know, inflation did not go down in June. The consumer price index jumped to 9.1% from a year earlier. Food and energy prices drove that. And we have seen the average cost of a gallon of regular gas drop from its record-high in June - down by about 69 cents. But the economic data are sending mixed messages, and the Fed has not gotten a clear indication inflation has peaked, never mind a sign that it's started to subside. MART\u00cdNEZ: So if the Fed continues on this path, what are the risks? GURA: So the Fed's big fear is this doesn't end with a soft landing for the U.S. economy that we've heard so much about, that, instead, the Fed triggers a deep downturn. Now, some economists say a recession is necessary to get inflation under control. Basically, we need a sharper slowdown to kick this. But Fed Chair Jerome Powell says that is not what he and his colleagues are trying to do right now. And, A, he believes they have the capacity to deal with high inflation without triggering a recession. MART\u00cdNEZ: You know, David, it feels like what we've talked about is the if-this part. So now what will be the then-that part? MART\u00cdNEZ: Yeah. If this works, borrowing costs will continue to go up. We'll see a decline in demand for goods and services. You know, I said this isn't going to be painless. And we've already seen some companies slow hiring and cut staff this week. The e-commerce company Shopify laid off a thousand people, and hundreds of tech companies have cut jobs. Economist Michelle Meyer says we're going to see more of an effect on what has been a strong labor market, and Americans are going to feel that. MEYER: To me, I think a lot of it comes down to jobs - whether you have a job, whether you expect to keep your job, and what that might mean for your future path and income. MART\u00cdNEZ: David, one more thing. Tomorrow we're going to get that all-important report card on the economy. Tell us about that. GURA: That's right, GDP - gross domestic product - for the second quarter. This will tell us how much the economy grew or how much it shrank. And what we could see are two consecutive quarters of negative growth, which, in general, has signaled a recession, even though it is not the official definition of one. And there is, I want to underscore, a lot that's unique about this moment. First and foremost, the economy is still adding jobs, month after month - 372,000 new jobs in June, even as the Fed raised interest rates aggressively, which, A, is not something we've seen going into past recessions. MART\u00cdNEZ: NPR's David Gura, thanks a lot. GURA: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MART\u00cdNEZ: As Indiana lawmakers consider a bill that would ban most abortions in that state, an Indiana doctor is speaking out after she found herself at the center of a national controversy around the issue. FADEL: Dr. Caitlin Bernard provided an abortion for a 10-year-old girl from Ohio in late June, after the state's trigger ban prohibiting most abortions took effect. MART\u00cdNEZ: NPR national correspondent Sarah McCammon covers reproductive rights. She sat down for an interview with Dr. Bernard yesterday. Sarah, why is she speaking out now? SARAH MCCAMMON, BYLINE: Dr. Bernard has been silent for several weeks as she faced attacks from prominent conservatives who questioned both the story about the 10-year-old patient and her credibility. Some of those attacks continued even after a 27-year-old man was charged with the girl's rape in Ohio and after the state of Indiana produced documents that appeared to corroborate Bernard's account. And she told me she wants the public to understand, from her perspective as a doctor, what she sees. CAITLIN BERNARD: I think what's been lost in the political discourse about abortion is that abortion is health care, that, again, there are so many situations that people may face for which abortion care is necessary, is lifesaving. MART\u00cdNEZ: You mention she's been attacked by prominent conservatives and public officials. What's the impact been? MCCAMMON: Yeah, she says she's experienced harassment, along with a lot of support in recent weeks. And she's worried about the safety of her family. In the past, she's faced threats, and the FBI has had to be involved. Indiana's attorney general, Todd Rokita, has repeatedly claimed, without providing evidence, that she's failed to properly report abortions. And speaking to a right-wing media outlet called \"Real America's Voice\" last week, he accused Bernard of using the girl to, quote, \"further a pro-abortion narrative.\" (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"JUST THE NEWS NOT NOISE\") TODD ROKITA: The last thing you call a person like that, who does that to a 10-year-old to further her ideology, the last thing you call her is a victim. MCCAMMON: Dr. Bernard's attorney sent him a cease-and-desist letter and then, last week, sent a more formal notice as a first step toward a possible defamation suit. And in a statement to NPR yesterday, Rokita called that letter, quote, \"an attempt to intimidate and obstruct his work.\" Here's how Bernard responded when I asked her about that. BERNARD: One of us is the state attorney general, and one of us is a physician. And it's very clear who is being intimidated in this situation. MCCAMMON: And she says her goal in all this is to make sure doctors feel safe providing care to patients in accordance with the law. MART\u00cdNEZ: Now, lawmakers in Indiana, the place where the girl had to go, they're meeting this week to discuss a proposal to ban most abortions. Where does that effort stand? MCCAMMON: Right. That bill, with narrow exceptions for rape and incest and to save a pregnant woman's life, is advancing in the Indiana Legislature. The state Senate is expected to debate it this week. Dr. Bernard says even a law with exceptions would put her patients in danger. BERNARD: Medicine is not a list of exceptions. I cannot try to fit every single situation into a law. It's going to be very dangerous. We're going to see people who are forced to continue unsafe pregnancies, who are going to die because of those pregnancies. We're going to see young women forced to leave their home, travel far away for the care that they need. MCCAMMON: And I should mention, A, West Virginia is also having a special session this week. Lawmakers there are looking at a bill that would make most abortions a felony. MART\u00cdNEZ: NPR's Sarah McCammon, thanks for sharing that interview. MCCAMMON: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MART\u00cdNEZ: The European Union has agreed to a plan that aims to cut gas consumption across Europe by 15%. FADEL: This move comes the same week that Russian energy company Gazprom abruptly cut gas deliveries to Europe through one of its most important pipelines. MART\u00cdNEZ: NPR's Rob Schmitz joins us now from Berlin to talk about all this. Rob, the EU came to this agreement quickly, but it did so after many of its members were able to get exemptions from having to make these cuts. So what did EU members agree to exactly? ROB SCHMITZ, BYLINE: Yeah, EU members agreed to cut their gas consumption by 15% in spirit. But it's important to note here that these cuts are voluntary. They stop being voluntary, though, should Russia create an energy emergency by making sudden cuts in gas supplies to Europe. MART\u00cdNEZ: And Russia did that, right? SCHMITZ: Yeah, that's right. Not only did they do it this week, but this goes back several weeks, when Russian energy company Gazprom abruptly cut the flow of gas on its Nord Stream 1 pipeline by half. And then earlier this month, the company simply cut off all the gas in the pipeline for a 10-day period, and it resumed last week. But then it cut gas again this week. So as it stands, the pipeline, which connects Germany to Russian gas, is now flowing at 20% capacity. So given this as a backdrop, member states will now need to start looking for energy savings so that they can meet this 15% gas savings benchmark because many see future cuts from Moscow as likely. And if the Kremlin should do that in the winter, when Europe needs more of its gas for heating, then we're looking at a more dire situation. MART\u00cdNEZ: Now, we mentioned on the cuts that not all EU member states will need to make them. Tell us about the exemptions. SCHMITZ: Yeah, there are several EU countries that are not burning Russian gas for electricity or heat, so they've been granted exemptions, as have other countries that have already launched ambitious energy savings plans. I spoke to the German Marshall Fund's Jacob Kirkegaard about this, and here's what he said. JACOB KIRKEGAARD: So, you know, once you factor in all these exemptions, it's pretty clear that the number of countries that have huge reliance on gas and none of these exemptions - well, they're going to be bearing most of the pain or most of the burden here. That is Germany, Austria and others - precisely, frankly, the way it should be. SCHMITZ: And, A, Kirkegaard is not alone in this opinion. Many in Europe believe Germany - which, up to the war in Ukraine, relied on Russia for half its natural gas - should shoulder most of the burden here due to its risky decision to rely so heavily on Moscow for its energy in the first place. In fact, the original proposal was for all EU states to cut 15% of their gas consumption. But the southern European states that, long ago, decided not to rely on Russia for energy were angry, saying they shouldn't have to pay for what they saw as Germany's energy mistakes. MART\u00cdNEZ: So then what is Germany doing to reduce that Russian gas reliance? SCHMITZ: Quite a bit. Germany's parliament has passed a law that will fast-track construction of liquefied natural gas terminals, with the first one scheduled to be completed by the end of the year. That gas will be imported from the Middle East and the United States. The government is also conducting an energy survey right now to explore whether it should extend the life of three nuclear power plants that are scheduled to close by the end of the year. And we will know more on that option in a few weeks. MART\u00cdNEZ: NPR's Rob Schmitz is in Berlin. Rob, thanks. SCHMITZ: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MART\u00cdNEZ: This is the news that developed overnight. The Department of Justice is investigating former President Donald Trump as part of a criminal probe involving an effort to overturn the 2020 elections. FADEL: That's according to reporting from The Washington Post. Now, we know that the DOJ has been looking into people Trump associated with, such as Rudy Giuliani. But this development suggests that investigators are taking a deeper interest in Trump's actions. MART\u00cdNEZ: Yeah, that's important because no former president has ever been charged with a crime in the country's history.

The 2022 midterm election made history with the most wins for openly LGBTQ candidates. At least 340 candidates have won their races, beating the prior record of 336 in 2020. This year also saw 678 out LGBTQ candidates \u2013 the most ever \u2013 on the general election ballot. Since the organization Victory Fund began in 1991, it has supported LGBTQ candidates running for office \u2013 from helping train people how to campaign and what to do after winning, to offering a network of fellow LGBTQ elected representatives to learn from. This election, the fund endorsed more than 500 candidates, Victory's Vice President of Political Programs Sean Meloy told NPR. The most it had endorsed previously was around 300. \"Normally, when someone gets in [office], they don't pull the ladder up after,\" he said about the LGBTQ community. \"They're going to say, 'Hey, who's next? Who's going to take over for me? Who else can I get to join me?' I don't think it's a coincidence that we have more LGBTQ candidates running than ever at the same time we have the most LGBTQ people in office,\" a number which he said is a little over 1,000. This year saw many candidates running who are underrepresented within the already underrepresented LGBTQ community. \"People of color, trans people and non binary people,\" he said. \"And in places where we need those voices, and the mere fact that an LGBTQ person steps forward to run \u2013 and then hopefully win \u2013 helps change hearts and minds.\" There were a number of notable firsts in the winners of the midterms. The country elected its first openly lesbian governors, with Maura Healey in Massachusetts and Tina Kotek in Oregon. In Connecticut, Erick Russell has become the first Black LGBTQ person elected to statewide office in U.S. history. New Hampshire's James Roesener is now the first trans man ever elected to any U.S. state legislature. Zooey Zephyr, who ran for the Montana House of Representatives, will be the first openly trans person in the state's legislature. She won with almost 80% of the votes, according to Ballotpedia.org. \"I always hesitate to call an election historic, because the attacks on human rights, education, healthcare, public lands, unions, etc. feel perpetual,\" Zephyr told NPR. \"Every election requires our attention because there is always something important worth fighting for, and if we fail to fight to our fullest, there are always groups waiting to strip our rights away.\" \"I do think given the way in which attacks on lgbtq people have ramped up over the last year has served as a reminder that lgbtq people need to be in the room where the laws are being written,\" she continued. \"300+ anti-LGBTQ pieces of legislation introduced last year, over half of which targeted trans people specifically.\" Zephyr said that not to be clich\u00e9, \"but representation matters.\" Meloy also described the importance of members of the queer community being in the room where decisions are made. \"Until folks in Montana and so many other places see LGBTQ people in office, they're gonna keep beating us up, and they're gonna keep [...] attacking us legislatively,\" he said. \"We're just going to be an amorphous enemy, as opposed to a smiling face that's sitting next to them.\" Meloy said their candidates have stepped up because there's never been an LGBTQ person to directly look in the eye of someone who, for example, might be passing a piece of legislation that cuts support for homeless people, who are disproportionately LGBTQ youth. Alaska voted in its first three LGBTQ politicians to the state legislature: Ashley Carrick for House District 35, Jennie Armstrong for House District 16, and Andrew Gray for District 20. Ashley Carrick, a bisexual woman, told NPR that she didn't run because she's LGBT, but she is LGBT, and that type of representation is long overdue in Alaska. \"That's a perspective I carry with me as I look towards a future for our state where we promote the long-term best interests of Alaska and its people,\" she said. \"I'm proud that Alaska went from being one of three states that had never elected an out LGBTQ+ state representative to now having three of us elected at once,\" Armstrong told NPR. \"I feel incredibly encouraged that my fellow Alaskans backed so many candidates that will fight to protect reproductive health care, push back against attacks on LGBTQ+ youth, and support building an inclusive economy where everyone has the opportunity to thrive.\" She also expressed her gratitude for the late state Sen. Johnny Ellis, and honored the sacrifice he made by remaining closeted for decades in the state legislature \u2014 a reminder of how acceptance in America has changed. Members of the LGBTQ community are uniquely qualified to represent their constituents, Meloy said. \"We intersect with every single other community,\" he said. \"We have millennials, we have scientists, we have union members, we have teachers and we've got folks from every age bracket and every demographic.\" He described that LGBTQ people bring a new and unique angle to help make our government look like the people it's meant to represent, and their belief in the fundamental right to privacy carries through all they pursue. \"They have to know when to, you know, when it's safe for them to be themselves in so many places,\" he said. \"I think that that brings an understanding of their community, and I also think it brings a level of empathy for other folks who have been forgotten or actively attacked by the government.\" To reach equitable representation, the U.S. needs to elect more than 35,000 additional out LGBTQ people to office, according to Victory Fund. Meloy said that Millennials and especially Gen Z are identifying as LGBTQ at levels never seen before. He thinks that fact may mean some of the gap will naturally be filled as younger generations run for office. When LGBTQ people win elections, more members of the community follow them, Meloy added. He hopes that the election of New Hampshire's James Roesener, who just became the first trans man ever elected to a state legislature, will inspire other trans men to run for office. He cited the uptick in trans women candidates after Virginia State Delegate Danica Roem won her race in 2017. \"I think it shows that it's possible, right? And so many underrepresented people in government \u2013 women, young people, people of color, LGBTQ people, disabled people \u2013 they're always told, 'Oh, you can't do it [...] because it hasn't been done,'\" he said. \"So breaking that barrier makes that argument \u2013 'No.' Which is a huge starting point.\" Erin Reed, a content creator and queer legislature researcher who shares LGBTQ news, noted that not only were many LGBTQ candidates elected, but many voters rejected anti-trans sentiments. \"The loss of anti-transgender candidates from the school board level up to the state level sends a clear message that basing your candidacy on hate does is not a winning strategy,\" Reed told NPR. \"So many candidates thought they could rely on beating up on transgender people for an easy victory and they left election night disappointed.\" Reed said this won't stop attacks on transgender people. \"I anticipate 2023 will be the worst year for anti-trans legislation ever,\" Reed said. \"But it does send a clear message that voters are not moved by anti-trans laws.\"",

            "article_content": "Obama's attorney general says that when it comes to voting rights, the Supreme Court has increasingly become \"an impediment to justice.\" Holder's new book is Our Unfinished March.  TERRY GROSS, HOST: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. My guest, Eric Holder, became the first African American attorney general in 2009 when he was appointed by the first African American president, Barack Obama. One of Holder's priorities as AG was voting rights. But during his tenure, in 2013, the Supreme Court gutted key parts of the 1965 Voting Rights Act in the case Shelby County v. Holder. Shelby County, Ala., had challenged the provision of the Voting Rights Act that required preclearance, which meant states, like Alabama, with a history of discriminating against Black voters needed to receive clearance from the Justice Department before enacting any new voting laws. The Shelby decision, striking down that provision, opened the door to a slew of voting restrictions. After Holder stepped down as attorney general in 2015, voting rights and election fairness remained a top priority. He founded the National Democratic Redistricting Committee with the goal of reforming how state legislative maps are drawn to ensure they're fair, not partisan, and ending the practice of gerrymandering. In his new book, Holder asks what he describes as an existential question - how do we save democracy before it's too late? The book, co-written with Sam Koppelman, is called \"Our Unfinished March: The Violent Past And Imperiled Future Of The Vote.\" Eric Holder, welcome to FRESH AIR. I want to start in a similar way your book does. Take us back to when you were - I think you were 12 - watching reports on the march on Selma across the Edmund Pettus Bridge, the march for voting rights in which people, including John Lewis, were beaten by the police. ERIC HOLDER: Yeah, it was in 1963. I was 12 years old. I was in my basement of my small house in Queens looking at a black-and-white television and witnessing what happened as marchers tried to go across the Edmund Pettus Bridge. It was something that was broadcast really, you know, around the nation. But it really struck me, living in Queens, living in the North, that largely African American citizens - then called Negroes - were trying to cross a bridge for voting rights and were having their heads bashed in by - it appeared to be policemen - you know, I found out later on they were state troopers. And it left a big impression on me. And I remember my parents explaining to me, you know, what had happened, what these people were fighting for - and again, something that I assumed everybody had the right to do. I mean, I went to the polls all the time with my parents in Queens. It was something they embedded in me, this notion of if you have the opportunity to vote, that you're supposed to do that. And then I was witnessing, in our same country, you know, I don't know - I didn't know how far away at that point in my life, that people who look like me were being denied that opportunity to cast a ballot. GROSS: Voting rights became a priority for you as attorney general. How did that become a priority? HOLDER: Well, you know, I like to think of myself as a child of the '60s. And, you know, I remember what I've just described - you know, the '65 incident at the Edmund Pettus Bridge. I remember before that - again, on that black-and-white TV - seeing, in 1963, as my future sister-in-law was denied the opportunity to enroll at the University of Alabama when George Wallace stood in the schoolhouse door. Those left impressions on me. The '60s was also a time for African countries asserting their independence. Both of my parents come from Barbados. Barbados declared its independence in 1966. The civil rights movement was in flower. And all of those things left in me an impression that there was the need for progress, that old ways of doing things had to be done away with, and that I wanted to be a part of that. GROSS: While you were attorney general, there was the now famous case, Shelby v. Holder, where Shelby, Ala., challenged the constitutionality of part of the Voting Rights Act. So just to refresh people's memories, explain what that case was about. HOLDER: Yeah. The Shelby County v. Holder case arose in 2013. Shelby County, Ala., filed a lawsuit that essentially challenged what's called the coverage formula in the 1965 Voting Rights Act, which has legitimately been called the pearl of the civil rights movement. There is a coverage formula within the act that sets out the basis by which certain jurisdictions are covered. And if they are covered, then they have to - if they want to make changes in their voting procedures, they had to go to the Justice Department to get something that's called preclearance. People in the Justice Department, in the Civil Rights Division, would look at the proposed change and, if it didn't impinge on the rights of the citizens in the jurisdiction, would preclear it - approve it. If there were problems, we tried to work them out. If it couldn't be worked out, then the Justice Department had the ability to file a lawsuit. The folks in Shelby County challenged whether or not that formula was still valid. It had been put together in 1965. This is now 2013. And the Supreme Court, in a 5-to-4 decision, sided with Shelby County and said that the coverage formula was not historically correct and that, therefore, the ability of the Justice Department to preclear that which Shelby County wanted to do was unconstitutional. The problem with the Supreme Court ruling - Chief Justice Roberts very famously said in the majority opinion that America has changed, which was definitely true. The America of 2013 was fundamentally different and better than the America in 1965. But America had not come far enough. And as a result of that decision, we saw, very quickly, states that previously had been covered by the act putting into place a number of voter suppression mechanisms and techniques. As then-Justice Ginsburg, I think, presciently said - and I'm paraphrasing here a bit - she said, you know, if you have an umbrella over your head in a thunderstorm and you're not getting wet, that doesn't mean that you remove the umbrella and still think that you won't get wet. And so that was her way of saying America has changed. But if you remove the protections of the Voting Rights Act, America and the people in those covered jurisdictions are going to get wet yet again with inappropriate and prejudiced voting mechanisms. GROSS: So before the Shelby case, the Justice Department had to give clearance to any new restrictions in places that were historically prejudiced against certain voters, like Black voters. And the Roberts decision basically said, hey, that's in the past. Things have changed. Why hold the past against places like Shelby County, Ala.? HOLDER: That's basically right. I mean, yeah, the covered jurisdictions were largely the states that were part of the Confederacy, although there were some covered jurisdictions. Actually - people find this kind of, you know, hard to believe - parts of New York - New York state - were covered, as well. But they were largely Southern states that had been a part of the Confederacy. GROSS: So let's take this to the really practical level. What is something that your Justice Department was able to do to uphold voting rights under the Voting Rights Act that you were no longer able to do under the Voting Rights Act after the Supreme Court decision striking down key parts of the act? HOLDER: Well, we filed a suit in Texas, where Texas tried to impose a photo ID regimen that required everybody who wanted to vote to possess this state-issued photo ID. And we were able to show that this had a disproportionate and negative impact on people of color who didn't have access to photo ID, didn't own cars to the same degree that their white counterparts did. If they didn't possess a photo ID, they could go to a place and get one issued to them. But in order to do so, you had to have backup materials - birth certificates, things of that nature. And what Texas says - we'll make that available to you. But in order to do it, you have to pay $22. And what we said was, that's almost like a poll tax. You're going to make people who don't just have photo ID - perhaps they don't possess a driver's license - you're going to make them pay $22 to come up with a way in which they can obtain that photo ID. And judges in Texas had - at the trial court level - had said that the position of the Justice Department was, in fact, one that was justified. GROSS: And you were able to do that because of the Voting Rights Act. HOLDER: Yeah. Texas had - was a covered jurisdiction. And the changes that they wanted to make in their voting procedures was something that we could examine under the Voting Rights Act of 1965. GROSS: What was your role in arguing the case in the Supreme Court in Shelby v. Holder? Your name is on the case 'cause you were the head of the Justice Department. So what did it mean to have your name on the case, and what role did you actually play in the case itself? HOLDER: Yeah. The case was argued by our very able solicitor general, Don Verrilli. And as he prepared the briefs and actually went to the oral argument, he said, Eric, I actually think that we're going have a problem here, that the court may rule with Shelby County. And I thought, well, this is a litigator speaking to me - you know, a person who's looking at all the possible negatives - because I thought, given the record that Congress had put together, the thousands of pages of testimony, thousands of pages of documents, near-unanimous approval of reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 - given that record that the Supreme Court was dealing with, I simply didn't think that the court would, in essence, go against the findings or the virtually unanimous approval of Congress in reauthorizing the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and the signing - the re-signing of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 by President George W. Bush. I didn't expect the court to, in essence, take a contrary position. But Don Verrilli - again, our solicitor general - thought that that was indeed possible. I was maybe a little surprised by the court's ruling. I was certainly chagrined by the court's ruling. But it was one that, as I said, the solicitor general thought was, if not probable, extremely, extremely possible. GROSS: Is there anything in retrospect you would have done differently? HOLDER: I don't think so. I mean, I think that this is one of those cases where the case was argued well. The factual record was good. Legal precedent was on our side. I simply think that the court got it wrong. It was a 5-4 decision. And I think, you know, you get 50 years down the road, maybe shorter than that, the Shelby County v. Holder decision will be seen as one of the worst decisions of a United States Supreme Court, given the lack of coherence, I think, in the opinion, the way in which it dealt with the congressional findings and then the aftermath of the opinion that led to widespread voter-suppression efforts across the country. I mean, if you look since Shelby, we've had about 1,800 polling places that have closed that would not have been closed - that would have been opposed by the Justice Department - but nevertheless close, and predominantly in those covered jurisdictions. We've seen voting purging of voter rolls that have occurred, again, disproportionately in covered jurisdictions. There's a whole range of anti-voter measures that have been taken, and particularly in those states that had been covered by the Voting Rights Act of 1965, that would not have occurred had the court's decision gone in a different direction. GROSS: Let's take a short break here, and then we'll talk some more. If you're just joining us, my guest is Eric Holder, who was attorney general under President Obama. His new book is called \"Our Unfinished March: The Violent Past And Imperiled Future Of The Vote.\" We'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to my interview with Eric Holder, who served as attorney general under President Obama. He's written a new book called \"Our Unfinished March: The Violent Past And Imperiled Future Of The Vote.\" So you were very firm in your opinion that Shelby County v. Holder was settled in an unjust way. You really disapprove of the Supreme Court's decision and of Chief Justice Roberts' majority opinion. How does it feel to have this case that makes you so angry - have your name attached to it? It will forever be Shelby County v. Holder - you. HOLDER: Yeah. That's actually an interesting question. And I smiled a little bit because those who are near and dear to me, those who work with me, always refer to the case as the Shelby County case. They know that... GROSS: (Laughter) They leave your name off. HOLDER: ...There is a part of me that does not want my name - not a part - there is - my entirety does not want to be in any way associated with that case. It's almost as if, you know - like Dred Scott v. Holder or something like that. I mean, it's an odious case. And it is not something that I want to ever be connected to except for people to know it's something that I think was wrongly decided and had an extremely negative impact on our democracy. But I never refer to the case in Shelby County v. Holder. It is only the Shelby County case. GROSS: You said that you were chagrined by the Supreme Court's decision. In your book, you say this decision made you angry, angrier than you ever were as attorney general. Are there - like, what are the best channels of appropriately addressing your anger when you were attorney general? And did you ever worry that if you expressed too much anger, you would be portrayed as an angry Black man? HOLDER: Yeah. Well, I mean, what I tried to do was channel the anger that I felt immediately by calling to the Justice Department the next day, the heads of all of the major civil rights organizations to the conference room on the fifth floor of the Justice Department and in essence, say, I disagree with the opinion that the court has rendered. There are still parts of the Voting Rights Act that are intact, and we will continue to use those intact provisions of the act to do all that we can to protect the voting rights of all Americans. And we, I think, did as good a job as we could, given the way in which the court left the Voting Rights Act of 1965 in tatters. Now, I - and you raise another point, though. I - you know, I think as mad as I was - I think pissed off is the way I might have described it, you know, if I were being - you know, being totally truthful. I had to always measure the way in which I responded, both because I was the attorney general of the United States and then, as you say, did not want to be portrayed as an emotional and angry Black man. That is a component of who I am that I have to or had to deal with in my official capacity. And so it might have come off - my anger might have come off as more measured than it actually was. GROSS: Can you talk a little bit more about that concern about being portrayed as, like, an angry Black man? Like, what does that mean? And why do people in power who are Black sometimes have to not show their anger because of that racist way of being depicted? HOLDER: Yeah. Because if you demonstrate your anger, you can be dismissed. Well, yeah, he's mad because he's Black, and this affects Black people, and he's reacting as a Black person. And so what you try to do is you couch the anger that you feel in logic, in measured tones, to try to make sure that your listener understands that you're coming from a logical, neutral place. It's part of, you know, who we are as Americans. We have never really dealt with, I think, in an appropriate way, the question of race, the question of inherent, implicit bias. But it's something that as a Black man, I've had to learn to deal with and then try to navigate. And so, you know, if you were in the fifth floor of the Justice Department with me and you're part of my staff, you would have seen, you know, the real feelings that Eric Holder was feeling on that day if you'd seen me in the conference room when the cameras were there. You would have seen a much - person speaking in much more measured tones, but trying to convey as best I could in those measured tones, the depths of my anger. GROSS: You write that your silent protest against the court's decision was that you weren't going to appear in that Supreme Court during your tenure as attorney general. What did that mean exactly - that you wouldn't ever walk into the court, that you wouldn't want to argue a case yourself, which I'm not sure or an attorney general ever would do anyways? Like, what did you not do that you might ordinarily have done? HOLDER: Yeah. It's actually a tradition that every attorney general argues at least one case before the United States Supreme Court. The solicitor general... GROSS: I didn't know that. HOLDER: Yeah. The solicitor general, as I say in the book, picks, you know, basically the easiest case that's up for the term so that the attorney general will go in there, have to deal with the easiest questions and get close to guaranteed, you know, victory. And I actually kind of looked forward to the possibility of arguing before the court. When I was the deputy attorney general, I remember watching Janet Reno go to the court. And you have to wear the appropriate clothes. And she had what she described as a pretty good, you know, interaction with the court. And, of course, you know, she won. I didn't want to do my argument during the first term out of concern that something might be said or characterized. It might hurt the president, so I was going to wait for the second term. And after Shelby County, which happened in the second term in 2013, I decided I was not going to go to the court, given what I felt they had done in the Shelby County case and in some ways legitimize that tradition. I wanted to at least make clear among those who knew at the Justice Department that this attorney general was not going to argue a case before the Supreme Court. You know, solicitor general, people who had served as solicitor general before Don tried to convince me to do it. And I told them I just wasn't going to go up there and argue a case. GROSS: Let me reintroduce you. If you're just joining us, my guest is Eric Holder, who served as attorney general under President Obama. His new book is called \"Our Unfinished March: The Violent Past And Imperiled Future Of The Vote.\" We'll be right back after a short break. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Let's get back to my interview with Eric Holder. He was attorney general under President Obama. His new book is called \"Our Unfinished March: The Violent Past And Imperiled Future Of The Vote.\" You know, you said that you started to think of the court as being more ideological, not more partisan, but more ideological. Now we're expecting the Supreme Court to basically undo Roe v. Wade because we had a preview of the decision. Now, it's only a draft. But it's likely to - the final version is likely to be a variation of that draft. What are your impressions of the Supreme Court now in the light of that likely decision? HOLDER: Yeah. I mean, I don't think we're likely to see the opinion that was leaked that had that caustic, heated, over-the-top language. I'd be very surprised if much of that opinion itself survives or the language of that opinion survives. I think it's likely, on the other hand, that you will probably get five justices who will vote to overturn Roe v. Wade. And that'll be a seismic thing for this country. And it is, I think, a continuation of the court acting in an ideological way. You know, the court is supposed to respect precedent, apply facts to that precedent, and then jurisprudentially come up with an appropriate decision. I think what the court is doing here is deciding by personnel. The only thing that's different about the cases, the Mississippi case - the Mississippi abortion case that the court is deciding and other cases that are coming before it - are not the facts, necessarily. I mean, these kind of statutes would have been slapped down quite easily by a prior court. The only thing that's changed is who's on the court. And that's a really dangerous thing. Precedent is the glue for our judicial system. If you replace that with who serves on the courts, what is the majority of, you know, Democrats or Republican appointees or conservatives and liberals, if that becomes the focus, then you get what, I think, the nation is about to experience. It's the first time ever that we have had a right taken away from the people of this country. This is something that people have relied on for almost 50 years. And we're going to see a sea change in the way in which women's reproductive issues are dealt with in a wide swath of this country. GROSS: You were an advocate of marriage equality. Do you think that the basis of the Supreme Court's probable abortion decision, you know, the draft of the abortion decision, would lead to the overturning of marriage equality, even though the draft says that this interpretation of privacy only applies to, you know, Roe v. Wade, not to other decisions? But in another case, it could apply to other decisions, right? It's just not mandatory that it apply. HOLDER: Well, that's exactly right. Once you go after the underpinnings of Roe v. Wade, which really rests on a 1960s case, Griswold v. Connecticut, which establishes the right to privacy - once you, in essence, say that the right to privacy - or question whether or not the right to privacy exists and whether or not there - whatever you can get from an eviscerated right to privacy and say, well, that doesn't give to the women of this country the ability to have abortions, it's hard to put that, for lack of a better term, you know, that toothpaste back in the tube. The right to privacy stands for a whole range of things that we as Americans have come to think of as our - to which we are entitled, our rights. Among them are same-sex marriage. That is really - goes, you know, to substantive due process, to liberty and to the right to privacy. And so once you've attacked the right to privacy in the way that the court appears ready to do in the abortion context, it necessarily means that everything else that rests on that same right to privacy is now at risk. GROSS: What was your blood pressure like when Mitch McConnell blocked President Obama from appointing Merrick Garland as a Supreme Court justice, saying it was just too late in Obama's tenure as president? I mean, he wouldn't even let the nomination move forward. You were no longer attorney general. But I'm sure you felt very strongly. HOLDER: Sure. I felt very strongly about the fact that they were blocking even the consideration. It would be terrible if they had voted down Merrick Garland as a justice. But they didn't even give him the courtesy of a vote. And I thought that was outrageous. And as you said, my blood pressure was pretty high, not nearly as high as it was, however - or, you know, it was higher when I heard that Amy Coney Barrett was going to be considered as a Supreme Court justice. The original rationale for denying Merrick Garland an opportunity, a vote, was that the appointment had come - or the nomination had come too close to an election. Well, that's what Mitch McConnell said. And then, when Amy Coney Barrett was nominated by President Trump and while people were actually in the process of voting - this was 230 days or something before an election. This is while people were voting. They ended up, in a hurried manner, I think, over the course of, like, four or five weeks, confirmed her as a Supreme Court justice. Total hypocrisy. I mean, total hypocrisy. That kind of action by McConnell and his Republican colleagues really gets - you know, it's politically expedient. And I think they thought they had some kind of political masterstroke. But they did so at the expense of the legitimacy of the court. GROSS: Let's take a short break here, and then we'll talk some more. If you're just joining us, my guest is Eric Holder, who was attorney general under President Obama. His new book is called \"Our Unfinished March: The Violent Past And Imperiled Future Of The Vote.\" We'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF LOUIS SCLAVIS' \"FETE FORAINE\") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to my interview with Eric Holder, who served as attorney general under President Obama. He's written a new book called \"Our Unfinished March: The Violent Past And Imperiled Future Of The Vote.\" When you left your position as attorney general, in addition to returning to private practice, you made redistricting your cause. As we've discussed, voting rights has always been a really important issue to you. But, you know, redistricting is a different way of dealing with voting than, say, campaigns to get out the vote or even trying to strike down restrictive voter laws. Why did you make redistricting and gerrymandering your issue? HOLDER: Yeah. When I left the department, what I said in - I had a number of going away ceremonies, and what I said in each one of them was that although I was leaving the position, I was never going to leave the work. And then I had to try to define, well, what did that mean? What did the work mean? And it really came down to me for protection of voting rights. And then I was trying to think, well, within voting rights, what is it - what's the issue that I might be able to focus on? And as I looked at what happened in 2011, in 2012, the last time the country redistricted, I saw what Republicans had done there. Princeton University did a study and said that that was the worst gerrymandering of the past half century. And as a result of that gerrymandering, you saw a shift in power to Republicans over the course of the decade that was inconsistent with the amount of popular support they were getting. And that had a real substantive impact on a whole range of policy issues from, oh, from gun safety, you know, voting rights, climate, a whole range of issues, because gerrymandering has an impact not only at the federal level, but at the state level as well. And so I said, you know, that's a place where I think I'd like to focus to make sure that when - the next time we redistrict which would be in 2021, 2022, because of the pandemic, to make sure that the process is done in a much more fair way, and so that we have a decade where the parties will be competing against one another on the basis of their ideas, their policies, their candidates, as opposed to who had the ability to draw better lines at the beginning of the redistricting process. If you look at the ways in which - in that past decade, the negative impact of the gerrymandering, it was profound. And we see it actually now in what we're dealing with, where you have these antiabortion bills that are not supported in the states - by the people in the states where they come from, but state legislators can vote for them. And because they're in safe gerrymandered districts, they face no electoral consequence for doing something that's inconsistent with the desires of their constituents. And that's what enables the Supreme Court to write a decision that potentially will undo Roe v. Wade. I mean, they are - the Supreme Court is really just looking at state statutes. GROSS: You grew up during the civil rights era, and as you were coming of age you watched Malcolm X get assassinated, Martin Luther King, Medgar Evers. You saw attacks on citizens just standing up for their right to vote. As the first African American attorney general who was serving under the first African American president, did you think a lot about assassination threats because you were at a very impressionable age when black leaders were getting killed? And I don't know if I've hit on a very sensitive subject that might be difficult to discuss, but I thought I'd ask. HOLDER: Yeah. It is not something that you allow to be front of mind because it could be a crippling thing. And yet, yeah, there are, you know, those thoughts. I grew up, as you said, at a time when Medgar Evers was killed, when Dr. King was killed, you know, when civil rights workers, you know, James Chaney, Andrew Goodman, Mickey Schwerner were killed, when John Lewis was beaten. You know, interestingly, Malcolm X lived on 97th Street and 23rd Avenue in Queens. I lived on 101st Street and 24th Avenue in Queens. He lived four blocks away from me. I knew Malcolm X's house. I first saw Muhammad Ali, he was in - Cassius Clay - in front of Malcolm X's house and got an autograph from him. That's just a little side note there. And so it's not something that I talked about much with Barack, you know, other than kiddingly every once in a while. But it was something that, you know, we were cognizant of. He was ably protected by the Secret Service. I was ably protected by the FBI. And I think, you know, there were some extra measures that were taken that we don't really discuss. But it was - I felt that with the protection that I had, I didn't have to focus on those concerns, and I could just go about, you know, doing my job. GROSS: Did having Malcolm X live just a few blocks away from you make him - this iconic figure - more real to you? He wasn't somebody on TV only. His home - you'd pass it in your neighborhood. And I'm sure you might have felt the shock of his assassination more as a result of being so - in such close proximity to his home. What impact did that have on you? HOLDER: You know, it's an interesting question because I did see him, you know, occasionally and not, you know, not a great deal, but occasionally. And he was just, you know, this guy who had a funny last name. I didn't totally understand that as a kid, different religion - he didn't go to any of the churches, you know, in my neighborhood. But I understood that he was a man of significance and a person who was to be respected. Even if my father, who didn't agree with, you know, who Malcolm was and the things that he espoused, I heard that in my house as well. It wasn't until his assassination, after his assassination, and I got to high school and I read the autobiography of Malcolm X that I really understood the significance of him, the greatness of him, and the promise of him that was taken from us. That is a book that I consider probably the most influential book that I've ever read. But I think he was poised to be a much more important figure for the world at large and for white Americans at large, and he was taken from us too soon. But the reading of that book made me understand how lucky I was to live as close to him as I did. I only regret that, in some ways, that - as the young guy that I was, I didn't fully comprehend it then, you know, the greatness that was so near to me. GROSS: Let me reintroduce you. If you're just joining us, my guest is Eric Holder, who was attorney general under President Obama and is now - in addition to being in private practice, he is the chair of the National Democratic Redistricting Committee. His new book is called \"Our Unfinished March: The Violent Past And Imperiled Future Of The Vote.\" We'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF BEYONCE AND JAY Z SONG, \"BONNIE AND CLYDE\") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to my interview with Eric Holder. He was attorney general under President Obama and is now the author of the new book \"Our Unfinished March: The Violent Past And Imperiled Future Of The Vote.\" Your parents are from Barbados. You grew up in Manhattan or in Queens? HOLDER: In Queens. GROSS: In Queens, N.Y. Did your view of America, growing up in New York City, differ from your parents, having moved here to the U.S.? HOLDER: I think different in this way. My parents, as immigrants, love this country unquestioningly. My father came here as a 13-, 14-year-old boy. His mother moved here a couple of years before him, then sent for him and his sister. And he always thought this was the greatest country in the world, no questions asked. He served in World War II. And while he was in uniform in this country, first in North Carolina, he was told to get to the back of a bus, while in uniform in war. While he was in Kansas - I'm sorry, in Oklahoma, he was told to go to the back of a luncheonette to get a hamburger or something like that, again, in war while he was in uniform. Those, for me, the child of the '60s, would have been shattering, consequential, you know, differing ways in which I might have viewed my nation. But for him, they were simply things that had to be overcome. And so that was, I think, the difference between us. I grew up, you know, born in the early '50s, come of age in the '60s when we were questioning everything. And it was something that, you know, presented a bit of a schism between me and my father. Again, I questioned everything. It wasn't that he questioned nothing. He was a proud Black man. And he understood that there was a need for progress. But he really had a faith in this country that was unshakable. And I - you know, it is to his generation that I owe the success, you know, that I've had - people who loved this country when the country didn't love them back. You know, most people who protest are people who love this country. But it's also the quiet patriots, you know, like my father. And I think at the end of the day, in a lot of ways, you know, maybe he was right because that soldier who was discriminated against in uniform during World War II turned out to be the father of the first Black attorney general of the United States. GROSS: You went to Columbia University as an undergraduate, also as a law student. I think during your undergraduate years, that that was the period that there were constant protests at Columbia when Columbia's - students from Columbia were sitting in and taking control of administrative buildings. Were you part of those protests? HOLDER: Yeah, I sure was, as a freshman in 1969, 1970. There was an abandoned ROTC office on campus, and a group of Black students at Columbia decided that we would to take it over and convert it into a place where Black students could gather. We called it a Black lounge, a place where Black students could gather, study, you know, listen to music - just a place where, on a white campus, people of color could come together. And the place still exists. It's called - it's now called the Malcolm X Lounge. So that would happen in 1969. And the place still exists in the dorm where I lived - Hartley Hall. And, you know, it's one of the reasons why I love Columbia so much. They took these testosterone-afflicted, young 18-year-olds and said, you know, they're raising a legitimate concern. There's no place to meet for Black students. They're doing so in a way that we don't necessarily support, but we're going to talk to them. And we came to an agreement so that we actually got the Black lounge. And to take it one step further, the dean, who was the dean of Columbia at the time, was guy named Henry Coleman. And, you know, we said some unkind things to him. He kept his cool. And I actually had the chutzpah as a senior at Columbia to ask him to write my law school recommendations, which he very, you know, wonderfully did. We became friends. And both of us received - I guess it's the highest award you can get from the college - it's called the John Jay Award - on the same night. And I thought that was kind of a - it was, for me, a pretty emotional thing to have Dean Coleman get his award on the same day that, you know, out of control. Freshman Eric Holder got his award. But it is why I love the man and it is why I love - I continue to love Columbia. GROSS: How did your parents feel about you being a part of those student protests? I mean, here you were, like, I'm sure they saved money and worked hard, made sure you got a good education, which you did. You went to Columbia, one of the best universities in the country. And then what are you doing? You're part of an uprising on campus. Did they think of you as being, like, really ungrateful both to the university and to them and to your country? HOLDER: I can encapsulate their reaction in this story. Somebody comes to my dorm room the night of the takeover and says, hey, we're taking over the ROTC office. We're going to form a lounge. You know, it's going to be for Black kids. So I'm there. Voom (ph). I go, you know, just go, leave my dorm room. And I'm there. The next day, I have to come back, get some clothes, because we figured this is going to be a long siege. And my phone rings, and it's my mother. And she says, hey, what's going on up at Columbia? I understand some, you know, some Black kids have taken over the - an ROTC office. And I said, yeah, I'm one of them, mom. And she said, you're what? And she gave it to me, like, I didn't raise you to do this kind of thing. Your father and I saved money so that you'd go to this really great school. You worked hard in high school. And you're going to put it all in risk for some stupid thing like a Black lounge? I don't want you going back there. And I got out of the conversation, got my clothes and went back to the lounge. But you asked what my reaction - my parents' reaction was. Luckily, my father wasn't on the phone. My mother, as excited as she was, didn't threaten me in any way other than to express, you know, extreme disappointment. And my father probably would have said I'm going to come down and break your neck if you try to go back there. But that's who they were. GROSS: So did you feel like this was a turning point for you, that you had to decide between supporting your parents' point of view or supporting the social change, the campus change that you believed in? Were you getting pulled in two directions? Yeah. HOLDER: Yeah. I didn't really think I was getting pulled in two directions because in spite of the fact that my mother and I'm sure my father expressed, you know, were dissatisfied with the decision I made, they were also extremely supportive. And they were also people who were not afraid to fight for causes that they thought were just. And I thought - I didn't have the time, really, to explain to my mom why I was doing what I was doing. In years past, and we had that inability to have that conversation before she passed away, you know, she indicated that she understood, you know, what I was doing and ultimately expressed support for what I was doing, but also told me that she didn't understand at the time why I was doing what I was doing because I had not explained it maybe as well. But I think it was kind of consistent with their view of, you know, of fighting for your rights. GROSS: So, you know, your cause is voting rights and voting equality. A lot of people don't vote, and they say, like, why bother? Nothing changes. Both parties have problems. I - it's not going to matter. What do you say to them? HOLDER: That's nonsense. John Lewis and President Johnson both said it best that the vote is the most powerful instrument that we have, the most powerful nonviolent instrument that we have to bring about positive change. And we have seen that demonstrated throughout our history. You know, people gave their lives - those civil rights workers in 1964 in Mississippi. People understand the story. They died there. They were killed by the Klan. They forget they were down there to register people to vote. They understood what Freedom Summer was all about. It was to get people the right to vote. And if you look at Reconstruction, when the newly freed people had the right to vote, the South was transformed for a time. If you look at what happened in America after the 1965 Voting Rights Act, when people had the right to vote, America was transformed. A political and racial apartheid system was torn down as a result of the 1965 Voting Rights Act. And that's all connected to people having the ability to decide the direction of the nation by casting a ballot. I think that you turn your back on all that's good about America if you don't do the simple thing of casting a ballot. GROSS: Eric Holder, thank you so much for talking with us. HOLDER: All right. Well, thank you so much for having me. GROSS: Eric Holder served as attorney general in the Obama administration. His new book is called \"Our Unfinished March: The Violent Past And Imperiled Future Of The Vote.\" Tomorrow on FRESH AIR, we'll talk about how Fox News host Tucker Carlson created one of the most successful cable TV shows ever by offering messages of fear, loathing and resentment. Our guests will be New York Times reporter Nicholas Confessore, who wrote a series of articles about Carlson's show and its impact after analyzing hundreds of Carlson episodes. I hope you'll join us.

            "article_content": "NPR's Mary Louise Kelly speaks with Rep. Katherine Clark on her election as House Minority Whip.  MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: When Nancy Pelosi officially passes the baton as speaker of the House, she'll be passing on another title, too - most senior woman in the U.S. House of Representatives. Going forward, that distinction will belong to our next guest. KATHERINE CLARK: I'm Congresswoman Katherine Clark from the fifth District of Massachusetts, currently assistant speaker of the House. KELLY: Clark, who has represented Massachusetts in Congress since 2013, will become minority whip in January, the No. 2 Democrat in the House behind Representative Hakeem Jeffries. Well, Katherine Clark joined me earlier today from Capitol Hill. I began by asking how much harder she thinks it'll be to accomplish her party's agenda with House control flipping to Republicans. CLARK: Well, it's never hard to be on the side of the American people and to keep our focus there. And I think we have a blueprint from the midterms. KELLY: But you need the votes to do everything that you want to do, and you're not going to have them anymore in the House. CLARK: That's right. But we will continue to oppose extremism, to fight back. But also, we are going to find ways with this administration to make sure that people's needs and the solutions that they are looking for are the ones that we continue to promote. And we hope we will find partners in the GOP in that work. KELLY: To focus on a specific issue or two, do Democrats need a better plan for border security? And I'm asking especially in light of incoming GOP majority who say they are planning to focus on this. And there's some discussion even of a move to try to impeach Secretary Mayorkas, Homeland Security Secretary Mayorkas, over his handling of the issue. CLARK: Well, I think who needs a better plan for the border is the GOP. What we have seen is they want to demonize immigration. They want to divide us. They want to turn neighbor on neighbor not just on border security but on almost every issue that is important to the American people. What we haven't seen from them is anything close to solutions. Come together with us. You cannot govern with no, an obstruction. And that's where they are. KELLY: Are you concerned about the unprecedented number of people crossing the border? CLARK: We all should be concerned about the state of our immigration system and border security. And we know that our system isn't working for anybody. It's not working for those who are seeking asylum. It is not working for our employers, who are looking for a workforce that they need. So we have to come together on solutions. KELLY: May I ask you to put one on the table? What do you think should change in how people trying to cross are handled? CLARK: You know, the Dream and Promise Act is a key example. We have so many young people who are contributing and are American in every single way except on paper. We have put this forward for years now with no Republican response. KELLY: One other issue to ask you about - I know you've worked as a member of the Women's Caucus to message around access to abortions. Where does that fight go in this next Congress in a Republican-controlled House? CLARK: That fight remains one that I am proudly going to bring to my new position. Americans understand that if their government - if politicians are dictating if and when they can have children, that there is no control. KELLY: Is there specific legislation you would like to see advance or specific legislation you would like to block? CLARK: We've put forward all sorts of good legislation. Just look back to the Women's Reproductive Health Protection Act. We want to codify Roe. We want to make sure that we protect this right that has been rolled back. But the Republicans are going to go forward with their federal ban, and we are going to stand shoulder to shoulder in opposition. We saw women come out in droves to vote. Those voices are not going away. KELLY: Before I let you go, I have a somewhat more personal question. You wrote an op-ed this year - earlier this year for the website of our member station WBUR. And the headline was \"The Politics Of Going Gray,\" the decision being to stop touching up your roots and just... CLARK: Yeah, and just to let my hair go its natural color. But I quickly realized that it's also a political decision. KELLY: You write in this essay, quote, supporters pulled my staff aside and asked if I was ill because that was the only explanation they had for why I would age myself. People told me I would no longer be able to pass legislation, that I was throwing away my reputation as hard-working and, most confounding to me, that I would no longer be taken seriously by the public and my colleagues. I read that, and I thought, really, seriously? CLARK: It is - sadly, it is true. The good news is I am now whip-elect in the House. And so all of that has turned out to be incorrect. And I hope that it will be an example of, live your own truth. Be who you are, and you will find that the world will adjust to you. KELLY: We've been speaking with the proudly gray-headed congresswoman from Massachusetts, soon to become minority whip, Katherine Clark. Congresswoman, thank you. CLARK: Thank you.

            "article_content": "Republican Rep. Ken Calvert has been in Congress for 30 years and has opposed LGBTQ rights. Now, his newly redrawn district includes queer friendly Palm Springs, so he's changed his tune.  MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: Now to a hotly contested congressional race in Southern California. It's pitting an incumbent Republican with an anti-LGBTQ voting record against a gay former federal prosecutor who helped build cases against January 6 rioters. From member station KQED, Scott Shafer reports. SCOTT SHAFER, BYLINE: For the last decade, Palm Springs, with its large LGBTQ population, has been represented in Congress by Democrat Raul Ruiz, an emergency room doctor. But redistricting has changed all that, leaving Democrats like Sal Ladestro unhappy. SAL LADESTRO: I was really flummoxed when they redistricted because I thought Raul Ruiz was a great congressman for the entire region. SHAFER: Sitting in the grassy backyard of a popular Palm Springs coffee shop, Ladestro, who lives in nearby Rancho Mirage, is dismayed that Republican Ken Calvert would represent him in Washington if he's reelected. LADESTRO: He's really Trump-y, and he's got some really extreme views. SHAFER: For decades, Calvert's anti-tax, anti-abortion, anti-LGBTQ positions were a good fit for his constituents. But the new 41st Congressional District is different. It sprawls from Calvert's hometown of Corona, 80 miles east to Palm Desert. Among the Democrats in this new district is former U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer. BARBARA BOXER: Ken Calvert's a phony. SHAFER: Never one to mince words, Boxer says many voters here won't forget Calvert's anti-gay history, like voting against the Matthew Shepard hate crimes bill and opposing gays serving openly in the military. And she says voters won't be fooled by Calvert's recent switch, a vote in support of marriage equality. BOXER: He changed his vote on gay marriage because he got Palm Springs in his district. KEN CALVERT: It's not a free ride to take one position or another. SHAFER: That's Ken Calvert, who notes that his new district still has 70% of the same constituents, many of whom are very conservative. The 69-year-old Republican says he's genuinely evolved on same-sex marriage, just like former President Barack Obama did. CALVERT: I have looked at what's happened across the nation, over a million marriages, gay marriages around this country, that we're not going to unwind that. So there's no reason to create anxiety within that community. SHAFER: Calvert's opponent in this race is former federal prosecutor Will Rollins, who, at age 37, is many things Calvert is not - young, gay, pro-abortion rights and staunchly anti-Trump. WILL ROLLINS: Let me start by saying happy Sunday to everybody. (LAUGHTER) ROLLINS: Has everyone had a mimosa yet? (LAUGHTER) SHAFER: At a recent fundraising brunch at a home in Palm Springs, Rollins emphasized the contrast between himself and his opponent. ROLLINS: I mean, this is a guy who voted 14 months ago against the Equality Act, which is just designed to prevent employers from firing people for being gay. SHAFER: That pitch may work with voters here in Palm Springs, but Rollins thinks ultimately the race will turn on another issue - abortion. ROLLINS: Women and men who care about their sisters, their daughters, their moms, because there's only one party right now that's standing up for the reproductive freedom of women and keeping the government out of our bedrooms. SHAFER: But voters might be more focused on something other than abortion or queer rights, especially with gas prices topping $6 a gallon here - the economy. On a recent Saturday morning in working class Corona, 20 or so people gathered in an IHOP parking lot to fawn over classic cars. CHRISTOPHER CARLUCCI: This is a 2016 Mustang convertible. SHAFER: That's Christopher Carlucci, who lives here in Riverside County, and cares more about inflation and crime than same-sex marriage. He grew up in a traditional Catholic family. But now he says his attitude is live and let live. CARLUCCI: I have a few relatives that are, so to say, living with men that are men themselves, and I'm fine with it. I don't care. SHAFER: Elections are determined by turnout. And on that score, voters like Dave Hissen could give Republicans heartburn. He's disgusted by what happened on January 6. DAVE HISSEN: Dreadful. And I must tell you, I'm a Republican - dreadful, embarrassing, humiliating. SHAFER: Republican Calvert voted against certifying the election results. Hisen says because of today's extreme partisanship, he's not even going to vote. HISSEN: At my age and in my tax bracket, I choose not to get involved because I really don't care. My happiness is a lot more important than watching a bunch of kids fighting each other. SHAFER: Democrats are hoping attitudes like that among GOP voters, along with an energized base among liberals, will propel Wil Rollins to victory over Calvert, something they'll need if they're to keep control of the House.

            "article_content": "Because abortion rights would be decided in states if the Supreme Court were to overturn Roe v. Wade, the leaked draft has brought new midterm campaign enthusiasm to Georgia and other swing states.  LEILA FADEL, HOST: A U.S. Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade could quickly curtail access to abortion in a lot of states. That prospect is already shaping the way candidates, strategists, advocates and voters are thinking about the 2022 midterms, especially in swing states like Georgia. WABE's Sam Gringlas joins us from Atlanta for more on this. Good morning, Sam. SAM GRINGLAS, BYLINE: Hi, Leila. FADEL: So, Sam, if this draft decision holds up, states would decide whether to allow abortion. Where does that leave Georgia and other states? GRINGLAS: Well, Georgia's legislature is solidly Republican, and in 2019 they passed a bill banning abortion after roughly six weeks. That law would likely take effect really quickly if Roe is struck down. You know, for the last dozen years, Republicans have been just pouring resources into winning these state House races and then drawing district maps to lock in that political power. Democrats now admit that, for a long time, they just didn't invest enough in state legislatures. I talked about that with Jessica Post. She runs the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee. JESSICA POST: We need to do everything we can to win state legislatures. So I know folks right now may be giving to abortion funds. I would also say please support your Democratic state legislative candidates because they will be the ones deciding the fate of abortion in your state. GRINGLAS: So say Democrat Stacey Abrams wins her campaign for governor. Without the legislature, there's not a whole lot that she can do to undo laws that are already on the books. FADEL: Are you already seeing this draft opinion shaping election strategy in Georgia? GRINGLAS: Yeah. I mean, Democrats think this ruling could energize voters. There's a Democrat here running for attorney general. Her name is Jen Jordan. And right after this draft leaked, she sent off a tweet calling Georgia the next battleground for reproductive freedom, and she's pledging to fight restrictive abortion laws in the state courts. JEN JORDAN: This was not going to be front and center, obviously. You know, we were talking about pocketbook issues and consumer protection and voting and all that kind of stuff. But sometimes you don't pick the fight; the fight picks you. GRINGLAS: One more voice I want to bring in - this is Jeanna Kelley. She just signed up to volunteer with Jordan's campaign, spurred by this news, and she's already done a shift texting women voters. JEANNA KELLEY: I can't do anything else about this but vote and encourage other people to vote. But it really did feel good to be able to connect with women and say, hey, you know, we would love to have you join us in supporting this candidate. GRINGLAS: So at the end of the day, we really don't know how much overturning Roe would actually move the needle on Election Day. You know, persistent inflation, some other issue could end up outweighing everything else. FADEL: And what about Republicans? How are they responding? GRINGLAS: Well, let me just play you some tape from this week's Republican debate for lieutenant governor. All the candidates were lined up on stage, and they were asked if they're satisfied with the restrictive abortion rules Georgia already passed or whether they would want to do more, and here's what they all said. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"ATLANTA PRESS CLUB\") JEANNE SEAVER: I would love to ban abortion. BRAD MEANS: Just ban it? SEAVER: Yes, sir. MEANS: And, Mr. Miller, your thoughts? BUTCH MILLER: Ban it. MEANS: For you, Mr. Jones? BURT JONES: Ban it. GRINGLAS: Republican David Perdue, who's challenging Georgia's sitting Republican governor, Brian Kemp, says he would also now pursue an all-out ban on abortion. Kemp has not weighed in on that, but he might feel compelled to call for a ban, too. That could bite him in November, though, when he needs this broader swath of Georgia voters to keep him in office. FADEL: Hmm. Sam Gringlas, political reporter at WABE in Atlanta. Thank you so much. GRINGLAS: Thanks, Leila. Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.  All rights reserved.

It's not easy to find the funny in today's catastrophic news cycle, but that's Seth Meyers' job. The host of NBC's Late Night host is used to facing fear with humor. And that's why, after his wife gave birth to their second son in the lobby of their apartment building, Meyers appeared on TV the next day to tell the story. \"It should be noted that I absolutely could have taken that Monday off,\" Meyers now says. \"But I'm very happy that there is that sort of timestamp episode where I can one day show Axel, 'This is not even, you know, two days after you were born and this is your dad on TV telling the story.' \" Meyers writes about fear \u2014 and how we acknowledge or ignore it \u2014 in the new new children's book, I'm Not Scared, You're Scared! The story is about a bear who's afraid of everything, and his best friend, a rabbit, who loves risky adventures. By the end of the book, the bear has shown that when he's called on to have the courage to rescue his rabbit friend, he can do what needs to be done. \"It's about our relationship with fear,\" Meyers says. \"It's about the moments when you have to push past it. It's about the moments when maybe you should listen to your fear a little bit more. And hopefully it's a book that parents can read to their kids and then talk about.\" Meyers has satirized issues in the news ever since he became an anchor on Saturday Night Live's \"Weekend Update\" segment in 2006, a position he held until 2013. He's also been head writer on SNL. But he says that his favorite thing to do it is to read to his two sons \u2014 even though that's gotten a bit more challenging lately. \"This terrible thing is starting to happen, which is now my boys want me to make up a Batman and Robin story every night, and it's so exhausting,\" he says. \"But I love reading books to them, especially when it's a book where they just get quiet and focused. I love nothing more than seeing the faces of my children paying attention to a story.\" On writing a book about fear during the pandemic It was a weird time for us, because my wife and I were far more afraid during COVID than my kids were, just because they were, I think, too young to fully process it. But there was something about the idea that we were living through a really scary time. And ... you want to believe that the human spirit will rise to the occasion and we'll be courageous, especially when their courage will benefit others who are in danger. ... I do want to look back at this time and tell my kids, \"Hey, you did a really cool thing for two years. You guys wore masks when you went to school, and that was great that you did that. That was this sacrifice that you did for other people.\" ... I think it's nice to be able to have these moments to say, \"Oh yeah, you might be afraid of that, but you would rise above it if your brother or your sister were in danger.\" And that's something you should know about yourself. On kids having too much or not enough fear As a parent, there are things I'm frustrated my kids are afraid of because I think as an adult, I see them as irrational fears. But there are other things I am thrilled that they're afraid of, and that their fear tells them not to go to the top of the jungle gym before they're old enough to go across the monkey bars. And that fear tells them to stop their bikes before the street. And ultimately, as a parent, you want your kids to have an internal risk meter that they're constantly maturing and growing into. Not that as a parent you're ever going to relax, but you can at least relax a little bit. I think nothing would be scarier to me than having a fearless child. On their second son, Axel, being born in the lobby of their apartment building [My wife] felt a contraction. We got in the elevator. We walked out of the elevator into our lobby and she said, \"I'm having a baby right now.\" And I told her that was ridiculous. (I should note that I'm not and have never been an OB-GYN, and I know very little about the women's reproductive system, but I boldly told her that was fine.) And then I looked down, and it was very clear from the shape of her sweatpants that she was not lying. And so she got on the ground. It was also about a 40 minute drive to the hospital. So this was a huge decision on her part to stay. And she delivered the baby in the lobby. I called 911. Not that I'm the hero in the story, but I had called 911. I mean, everybody always talks about what my wife did, but I think both her and I were pretty heroic on the day. There were police officers and firemen surrounding us when our son, Axel, was born. On always wanting to be a father I had my kids a little bit later in life. But it's exactly as wonderful \u2014 it's beyond what I thought it would be. The biggest pressure I felt about it was, Oh my god, I hope I like my kids as much as I like my parents. ... It turns out it's pretty easy. You just love your kids so much and you get to watch them grow. And everything about their personalities makes sense to you because you've watched it each step of the way. And they're fantastic. And I'm saying this on very little sleep, because last night my 6 year-old threw up and then we had to bring him into our bed, and then the 4 year-old insisted he was about to throw up, even though he's a terrible liar, and we knew that wasn't true. And so we had both boys in our bed and one had a bucket to throw up in, and then the younger one was wearing his bucket as a hat. And we kept saying, \"You need to go back to your crib.\" And he kept saying, \"I don't want to miss the party,\" because he thought if people were up and talking the only word he had to describe that was it was a party. On staging an intervention for his friend, comic John Mulaney, who was abusing drugs, and then having him then on Late Night to talk about it I think that's one of the biggest upsides of being friends with incredibly funny people is they're going to have an ability \u2014 be it with the things they're going through or with the things you're going through \u2014 to find humor in it, and that will then make the passage through those tricky times a little bit easier to bear. And also with John's story particularly, when he tells it on our show or when he tells it on stage, I really hope that it brings comfort to other people who have been through it, be it on John's side of it or the rest of us that had to make that difficult decision to step in. On what it was like having to do an intervention for Mulaney I will just say it's really scary, because you don't know how your friends are going to react to it and you, collectively, with a lot of other people you trust, know what the right path forward is. This is someone you love and someone you believe is as smart as anyone you've ever met, and so you're really hopeful going into it that they're going to agree with the decision you all made without them. ... It was emotionally really exhausting. But in so far as the things you do in your life that take a lot out of you, there are very few that mattered more than that one. On \"Jokes Seth Can't Tell,\" a Late Night segment when he has writers from his diverse writing room tell jokes that he can't tell as a straight white man Again, [this segment] just came to us gift-wrapped by Jenny Hagel and Amber Ruffin. ... But particularly Jenny, who wrote a lot of monologues for us, she was a monologue joke-writer when we hired her, and she wrote these really funny jokes that I would say to her, \"These would be really funny if you, a Puerto Rican lesbian, told [them], but if I told [them] I think they would not go well at all.\" And we would laugh about it because she appreciated that that was true, that sometimes it's not just the joke itself, the delivery system matters. And then they pitched, \"What if we did 'Jokes Seth Can't Tell'? You will do the set ups and we'll do the punchlines of these jokes.\" And I mean, I can't believe how many we've done, but it's sort of just like the monologue, we do a monologue every night and \"Jokes Seth Can't Tell\" is it's own refillable bucket and they're just joyous to do. It's so much fun to sit out there with the two of them. So much of it is just about being lucky enough to have someone step in and say, \"Hey, just FYI, here's how someone like me hears that joke.\" ... They've saved us from making a lot of mistakes. I do not feel like anything we've ever cut because someone stepped in and said, \"That's going to be hurtful to someone\" has made our show any worse \u2014 if anything, [it] has made the show better. And I'm eternally grateful to have them around. Just, again, it's nice going through life, realizing you don't know everything and trying to learn a new thing every day.

His new book is After the Ivory Tower Falls.  TERRY GROSS, HOST: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. How did college go from being the doorway to the American dream to the nightmare of starting adult life deep in debt, unsure of whether your degree will help you get a job that even pays enough to pay off that debt. How do we go from the 1944 GI Bill, which offered World War II veterans - or at least white ones - easy access to college, to now the stress of today of trying to get into the right college? And how did colleges and universities become a target of the right? My guest, Will Bunch, addresses these and other related questions in his new book, \"After The Ivory Tower Falls: How College Broke The American Dream And Blew Up Our Politics - And How To Fix It.\" Bunch is a national columnist for The Philadelphia Inquirer, focusing on social injustice, income inequality, politics and government. The roots of his new book go back about 15 years when he was a reporter at the Philadelphia Daily News and his two children were in grade and middle school. As they struggled to make ends meet, he wondered how he'd ever be able to afford sending his children to a good college, especially during the two years when they'd both be in college. Will Bunch, welcome back to FRESH AIR. And congratulations on your book. WILL BUNCH: Thanks so much, Terry. Thanks for having me back. I appreciate it. GROSS: So your grandmother started a small college that was a secretarial college and then a business school. Your father - you know, your grandmother's son - went to college. You went to college. What did it mean to you? What did college mean to you? BUNCH: In the 20th century, college really became the American dream. It certainly was true in my family. There was just this innate sense that the path of life was to do better than the generation that came before you, right? So my grandmother, I think who always regretted never having the opportunity to go to college herself, even as she was, you know, recruiting kids and building this college in Peoria, you know, really pushed her kids to go to college. My dad got a full scholarship to go to Trinity College in Connecticut, so we took a big leap up the ladder. And when I was growing up, I wanted to not just go to college, but I wanted to go to the best college possible. So I was really focused on trying to get into an Ivy League school. I did actually end up going to Brown University. And I kind of assumed the same path for my kids. And my kids - I have two children. They're both very bright. But by the time they came of age in the 2010s, really the whole college environment had changed. This idea of going up another step up the ladder, for so many families, so many middle-class families like mine, I think the idea is more clinging to the ladder, you know, and not falling backwards, you know, as college gets more expensive and more competitive. GROSS: In writing about how college became part of the American dream, you go back to the GI Bill of 1944. The GI Bill gave certain benefits to returning World War II veterans. How did access to college become part of the benefits received by veterans? BUNCH: Well, the GI Bill, which is such a landmark achievement, because it's really the first time that we experimented with making college a public good. And so when World War II was at a point where in 1944, it looked like victory over the - Germany and Japan was coming into focus, the government said, what can we provide them? You know, what if we gave them different opportunities? What if we gave them, you know, enhanced unemployment benefits? What if we gave them job training? And what if what if we gave a college benefit? And you have to understand, in the 1940s, more than half of Americans didn't graduate high school. The amount of people who had a bachelor's degree in the 1940s was about 5%. Policymakers didn't really think a lot of these veterans were going to want to use the college benefit. It was just this kind of added perk in the program. In fact, that's why they offered such a sweet deal, that it was not only free tuition, but students received a stipend for books and living expenses so they could live. You know, a lot of these veterans were older. Some of them were married or had kids, but now they could afford to go to college. And it really got America thinking about, how do we expand college opportunities for even more of the middle class? GROSS: So the GI Bill enabled veterans to go to any college they wanted to. Like, how did that work? BUNCH: Yes. I mean, it was a remarkable benefit for the time. You could and many people did go to Ivy League schools or private institutions. You know, many campuses saw their enrollment double from the end of World War II to just a few years later. And veterans, you know, some schools had to build Quonset huts on the edge of campus to accommodate all these veterans. And, you know, what it showed was that there was just this strong desire for education out there and for people to want to have this opportunity to maybe move up from a working class factory existence to a more white collar lifestyle to maybe a career that was built around knowledge. GROSS: Well, first of all, you know, I want to mention something you point out in the book was that this was a great opportunity for returning veterans. Very few of those veterans were women. So it was an opportunity, really, for men and that most women were excluded from. And also, most Black people were excluded. Most Black veterans were excluded from this benefit, too. How did that happen? BUNCH: It wasn't under the law. It was interesting. Black veterans tended to be excluded because regional administrators were given a lot of leeway over how the program ran. So as you can imagine, regional administrators in the segregated South did everything they could to steer Black veterans away from college. Remember, there were other benefits, like job training and other benefits aside from the college benefits. So you saw a lot of Black veterans steered away from college, although Black college enrollment did rise noticeably during that period. GROSS: And college at that point, the way it was envisioned wasn't just about training for a job. It had like a higher purpose. President Truman, who succeeded Roosevelt, appointed a commission on higher education in 1946. And Truman said that we need to ensure that higher education would take its proper place in our national effort to strengthen democracy at home and to improve our understanding of our friends and neighbors everywhere in the world. So the emphasis was on like liberal arts education, a well-rounded person. How did that affect the direction of college and the expectations of students? BUNCH: You know, the GI Bill and the surge in college enrollment came on the heels of not just World War II, but the Great Depression. You know, you had the big ideological movements of the 20th century, fascism, communism, and there was a lot of interest in promoting democracy. And educators felt this strongly that giving people college opportunities wasn't just a way to have a more knowledgeable workforce, but it was a way to produce better citizens. And there was - so there was a lot of conversation in the 1940s and '50s around this notion that we call liberal education, or sometimes it's also called general education, that college shouldn't just be to learn, you know, one single career skill, but you should learn a broad array of subjects, that there should be more of a focus on great literature, the humanities, that more and more students should learn the social sciences, philosophy, which really boomed during those years. You know, sociology really took off as a major that, you know, in producing more well-rounded students that would promote better global understanding because people were very concerned about not having World War III. It would produce better citizens who would participate more in democracy. And students really responded to this. GROSS: Now, things started to change in the '60s because colleges became a place where students - many students became politicized. Many students became activists. Many of the young civil rights activists got started on college campuses. I mean, think of - as you point out, think of some of the sit-ins at lunch counters. Those were often college students - SNCC, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, which was a really important part of the civil rights movement. And then after that, you've got, like, the antiwar activists on campus and students demanding changes in the way education worked. The - you know, the feminist movement was very strong on campus. So what impact did that start to have politically in terms of a backlash against liberal arts education? BUNCH: Well, basically what happened in the 1960s is the kind of thing that - you know, the CIA calls this blowback - right? - when you pursue a goal and people turn against you - in this case, all the lofty ideals of the '40s and '50s about promoting democracy through education. It really worked. You know, you had these kids, you know, studying philosophy, studying the great thinkers and thinking about how to make a better society. And they started looking at what was happening in American society. The lunch counter sit-ins that started in Greensboro in 1960 just electrified campuses because it was just such a jolt to the conformity of that era, which a lot of students found stultifying. There was just very palpable excitement, first at the HBCUs. But then a lot of white kids said, we want to support this movement. Students at predominantly white universities started going to the Woolworths in their hometowns and started protesting. And it started this cycle - you know, the Berkeley Free Speech Movement of 1964, which was basically over, what rights do students have to express their political views on campus? And, you know, students basically won that protest. They convinced the faculty to side with them. And they won the right to speak out and distribute literature on campus. And that just flowed right into the anti-Vietnam War movement. And you had a conservative establishment that thought this was going too far or it was getting out of hand. GROSS: And during the - it was - the Berkeley Free Speech Movement kind of coincides with Ronald Reagan becoming governor of California. What did he do to try to change the political atmosphere on campus? BUNCH: Ronald Reagan emerged as an underdog candidate for governor of California in 1966. And this was right after the Berkeley Free Speech Movement. It was when you started seeing publicity about the counterculture of, you know, kids wearing blue jeans and having these parties with the wild psychedelic screens, with the music from the Jefferson Airplane or the Grateful Dead. And Ronald Reagan said famously that taxpayers should not be funding the intellectual curiosity of students. And this was a defining, you know, governmental philosophy for him. When he won in a landslide that fall - when he took office, you know, he tried to impose tuition. Colleges in California had been free. And, in fact, that was basically part of the state constitution and something that was cherished in California - the idea that higher education for all its citizens would be free. And Reagan thought that, you know, free tuition basically encouraged kids to rebel against the establishment. So he launched this long crusade to - he wasn't - you know, he had political opposition. And he wasn't able to increase tuition right away. But he did raise fees, and he basically set the groundwork for higher tuition in California. And then it became higher tuition in other states as well as the backlash spread. GROSS: Let's take a short break here, and then we'll talk some more. If you're just joining us, my guest is Will Bunch, author of the new book \"After The Ivory Tower Falls.\" We'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF DAN AUERBACH SONG, \"HEARTBROKEN, IN DISREPAIR\") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to my interview with Will Bunch, author of the new book \"After the Ivory Tower Falls: How College Broke The American Dream And Blew Up Our Politics And How to Fix It.\" He's a columnist at the Philadelphia Inquirer. So a conservative or right-wing attack on colleges is a kind of theme through the second half of the 20th century and onward. You have McCarthy, you know, during the red-baiting era, closely examining colleges and universities, Reagan as governor in California and then maybe as president - I'm not sure... BUNCH: Yeah. GROSS: ...You know, worrying about the effect of college campuses. Rush Limbaugh, when he started on radio, was attacking college professors and the culture on campuses. Is - do you see - I mean, I think the answer is yes. How do you see colleges and universities today as being attacked by the right? BUNCH: I think the whole idea of critical thinking, of, you know, rational inquiry has in one way or another just consistently posed a threat to the American right. And it's funny because the issues have often varied, you know? In the 1960s, the issues were racial segregation and the Vietnam War. Whereas today, you know, the issues are more things like policing, you know, the things that we saw in the George Floyd protests, or LGBTQ+ rights. And a big one today is climate change. You know, America is unique in the world in the amount of climate change denial among the citizenry. And, you know, you've had companies like ExxonMobil and big corporations funding these think tanks to create doubt about what was being taught at universities about climate change. GROSS: So we've talked about the backlash against the culture on college campuses. Let's talk about tuition 'cause that is such a big concern for all students and parents now. What started the trend of skyrocketing tuition? BUNCH: Several things happened at once. You know, as we discussed, I do feel part of it was the political backlash, that taxpayers were no longer interested in giving a blank check to public universities. And you've seen - you know, in my home state of Pennsylvania in the late 20th century, taxpayers paid 75% of the cost of public universities. Today, that number is only 25%. And the difference is made up in tuition that - you know, students and their families have to pay it. And in most cases, they have to borrow money to make it happen. This wasn't the only thing that was happening, though. Obviously, the economy began to change dramatically in the 1970s. You know, you had that period of stagflation and slowing job growth. And so this was also a reason for decreased government support. Interestingly, you know, colleges were starting to panic in the late '70s because also, the baby boom was winding down, and they were worried about, how were they going to attract students? And, you know, Harvard is such a pacesetter for so many things in the higher education field. And Harvard, in 1978, decided they would do a large tuition increase, for that time, of $850 a year, which, I think, was about 17%. And they said, well, we know that people who - certain people who are wealthy, who want the prestige of a Harvard education will pay this. Some of the extra money, we'll plow back into discounts for some of the middle-class students who go here. And so they created this model. It's called the high-tuition, high-aid model, and it worked. You know, applications didn't drop at all. So every year for the next decade, they raised tuition $850 every year. And this really started the cycle that we have known for the last 40 years of tuition going up every year. And what colleges learned is that families looking on where to send their kids to college weren't shopping for the best price; they were shopping for prestige. GROSS: You refer to the high-tuition, high-aid model. Where does the aid come in? Like, does - so it's a - tuitions have been rising. Where does the aid of the high-tuition, high-aid model come in? BUNCH: Well, Ivy League schools, you know, like Harvard, are able to do a little bit more with financial aid than some of their competitors. You know, these schools have billion-dollar endowments, and some of those endowments can be funneled into financial aid so they can give discounts to middle-class students. And then for lower-income students, you know, they have these so-called need-blind admission policies. Now, there's a lot of debate over whether they really meet all the need or not. But, you know, they clearly are able to do some things in the financial aid sector that - public universities or, you know, other kind of mid-level universities that are trying to keep up with the Ivy League schools of the world can't offer the same benefits, you know? You know, they're trying to keep up in competing for the top students, but they aren't necessarily able to compete in the area of giving financial aid to the lower-income students. GROSS: Will, I want to ask you about some of the plans that have been offered politically. Like, Senator Bernie Sanders has, you know, proposed forgiving student debt, which is a very controversial stand to take. What makes it so controversial? Like, what would it mean? BUNCH: Forty-five million people have some college debt. And many of those 45 million have more than 10,000. Some of them have 50,000, 100,000, 150,000. But you're talking about a minority of people. You know, only 37% of Americans have a bachelor's degree. And two things - first of all, not all of those people borrowed to get through college. You know, some people, their families or they worked their way through college, and they came out without debt. And I think more importantly, you know, the 63% who don't have bachelor's degrees feel that, why is paying off the debts incurred by these kids their responsibility? GROSS: Their responsibility in terms of paying taxes to cover the debt? BUNCH: Right. That the - you know, I mean, it's a very abstract thing. They basically - the government isn't getting the loan repayments, and so that's hurting the federal budget. So eventually, that would come back and hurt the average taxpayer. You know, in the book, I come out in support of massive debt forgiveness. You know, I think too many people from the last couple of generations were sold a bill of goods, weren't told either what college was going to cost or were misled on what kind of jobs and what kind of careers would emerge for them on the other side to pay them back. A major component of this crisis is these for-profit universities, which used very dubious methods to max out the amount of money that they could loan to each student, knowing that the government guaranteed the money, and saddling these kids with debt for - in many cases, for degrees that aren't really worth a lot in the job market, unfortunately. GROSS: Well, we need to take another break here, so let me reintroduce you. If you're just joining us, my guest is Will Bunch, author of the new book \"After The Ivory Tower Falls: How College Broke The American Dream, Blew Up Our Politics - And How To Fix It\" (ph). He's a columnist at the Philadelphia Inquirer. We'll be right back. I am Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF CRAIG DAVIS FEAT. JOHN CLAYTON AND JEFF HAMILTON'S \"COMPADOO\") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Let's get back to my interview with Will Bunch, author of the new book \"After The Ivory Tower Falls: How College Broke The American Dream And Blew Up Our Politics - And How To Fix It.\" It's about how we got to the point where instead of college, opening the door to opportunity and a better life, it leaves many students deep in debt, unable to get jobs with salaries big enough to pay off the debt. Bunch also writes about how college admission standards and high tuitions end up leaving many young people feeling excluded, which has contributed to the economic and political divisions of our country. Bunch is a columnist for The Philadelphia Inquirer, focusing on social injustice, income inequality, politics and government. Tuitions are so high in some schools, it just seems like how can anybody afford to pay like $70,000 a year for tuition and then do that for four years? You can explain how college tuition, you know, got more expensive, but it's really so expensive. Like, how did it get that high? Not - I mean, not every college costs that much, but a lot do. BUNCH: In the book, I devote a whole chapter to looking at the situation at one college, which is Kenyon College in Ohio. And I picked Kenyon partly for the political environment because it's a very liberal college in the heart of Trump country. But the economics of Kenyon also fascinated me. Their student body, about 20% of the students who go to Kenyon are from the top 1% of earners. And, you know, a majority of the students are from the top 20% of earners. So there is enough high-end demand to try to keep this system going. And, you know, like I said, high tuition does fund discounts for students who are truly in the, you know, what I might call the upper lower middle class, you know, families making $100,000 a year. They're probably not paying $75,000 a year to go to college. But, you know, they're paying maybe $30,000 or $40,000 a year because of these discounts. And the system has worked, you know, barely, although in the last couple of years, we've seen more and more middle-class folks questioning if college is really worth it at these prices. You know, the - we finally reached the stage where people are starting to think about price more than prestige. GROSS: So for students who are in over their heads financially in order to go to college and are accruing a lot of debt, what happens in the other parts of their life during college years in terms of being able to afford rent or food? BUNCH: Yeah. I think one of the major things about college today in the 2020s that the average person who's not in touch with college life doesn't understand is just the high level of problems like food insecurity on campus. You know, so many working-class families, their kids are, you know, going to these public universities trying to stay on the ladder, stay in the middle class. And they're really struggling to make ends meet. And, you know, most major universities nowadays have these large food pantries where students come every week to pick up macaroni and cheese or popcorn or just food to sustain themselves during the week. In 2021, and obviously, you had the pandemic going on, but there was a major study of 190,000 college students, and more than a third of them were dealing with food insecurity or hunger issues. And rent is a big problem in places like California, where the housing costs are so high. You have hundreds of college students who are living in their cars while attending classes. And, you know, to me, it just kind of shows what kind of a \"Hunger Games\"-type situation college has become for so many type people of doing what they can to make sure they get that piece of paper that will keep them in the middle class. GROSS: One of your suggestions in the book is a universal gap year, so that when you graduate high school, you have a year before entering college. And that year could include a year of national service. Could you describe what you have in mind? BUNCH: Maybe instead of feeling this incredible pressure at age 18 to either pick the right college and figure out what they're going to major in and how to pay for it, in so many of these 18-year-olds who don't go to college at 18 and then suddenly drop off the grid and, you know, fall into these rabbit holes, whether it's YouTube or whether it's, you know, the growing problem of opioid addiction in among among young people without college educations. I would love to see the government find opportunities for people from these different backgrounds to work together, you know, on environmental projects. You know, I mean, President Biden has proposed something called the Civilian Climate Corps, which is based on the famous Civilian Conservation Corps of FDR's New Deal, where you'd have people from different backgrounds, you know, spending a gap year, you know, working in communities, doing environmental projects like, you know, sweeping the forests that are getting consumed by these by these wildfires - right? - you know, for example, or working on water conservation projects. You know, I think it would be a chance to help young people find a sense of national purpose. You know, this used to be accomplished through wars, right? You know, you know, World War II or the Korean War, people from Alabama and people from Brooklyn and people from different ethnic backgrounds would fight together and in the same unit. And they develop a better understanding of the country and different people around that. And, you know, now that we don't have a draft and the military isn't a part of people's lives, you know, we don't have something that brings young people together and gives them a sense that maybe we're all on the same team and that we're not on the red team or the blue team. GROSS: So you think like a year of national service would be helpful? BUNCH: I do. I don't think, you know - some people have said we should make it mandatory. I don't think you can do that in the current political climate. But I do think, you know, if you made it a phenomenon and kind of an offer that young people couldn't refuse and, you know, got people really excited about the possibilities of what they could do during the gap year, because it gives our young people more time to find themselves and figure out what they want to do. You know, so many people at 18, you know, and their families basically are making bad choices. And that's resulted in things like the student debt crisis. But it's also, you know, it's also resulted in people deciding, you know, that they don't want to further their education, that college is too risky for them or it's too expensive. And, you know, we're losing people in that cohort. You know, there's been a lot of research that the Princeton University economists Case and Deaton have made a name for themselves writing about deaths of despair among working-class people, which refers to, you know, suicide, drug overdoses, alcohol addiction. And what they found is that people succumbing to these deaths of despair are getting younger and younger. And the No. 1 determining factor is whether or not they have a college degree, you know? Not having a college degree is the No. 1 driver of people being prone to these deaths of despair. And that's just one more reason why we need to put this on the front burner and talk about solutions to this, to the education problem. GROSS: Well, let me reintroduce you. If you're just joining us, my guest is Will Bunch, author of the new book \"After The Ivory Tower Falls.\" We'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF AMY WINEHOUSE SONG, \"YOU KNOW I'M NO GOOD\") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to my interview with Will Bunch, author of the new book \"After The Ivory Tower Falls: How College Broke The American Dream And Blew Up Our Politics - And How to Fix It.\" You say that Republicans are waging a war on higher education. And you offer examples from a couple of states, Wisconsin and North Carolina. Give us an example of what you mean. BUNCH: Well, Wisconsin is a perfect example, particularly during the tenure of Scott Walker as governor from 2010 to 2018. Some of it was just cutting funding for education. He certainly tried to reduce tenure protections for professors because he saw professors as promoting a liberal ideology. But to me, the most interesting thing was this idea of, what is college really for? And on the right, there's this push that college should be for workforce development and nothing else, you know, the flip side of this whole idea of liberal education and critical thinking. And in the middle of his tenure as governor, there was a huge controversy because he actually pushed to change the language of the University of Wisconsin's mission statement to take out the idea that the goal of the university is the search for truth. He wanted that language removed. He wanted it changed to, the purpose of the university is to develop the state's workforce, period. And, you know, I don't think people were ready for that. There was a huge outcry. And he actually backed down from that. But what you have seen in states like Wisconsin and North Carolina and several other red states is more and more politically connected people being appointed to the board of university trustees, trying to exert more control over what goes on on-campus, you know, over hiring, you know? In North Carolina, you had this huge controversy over the hiring of Nikole Hannah-Jones, the author of \"The 1619 Project,\" as a journalism professor there. She ended up not coming because of this back-and-forth over whether they were going to offer her tenure. And again, that was the conservative elements on the board of trustees. You know, now in Florida, you know, Ron DeSantis has done the same thing, you know? He has a very conservative board of trustees overseeing the public universities in Florida. They're making changes to tenure. They are changing the way that colleges are accredited to make it more difficult for these universities. And it just reflects an overall hostility on the right to learning and education. GROSS: We both live in Pennsylvania. And Doug Mastriano, who's a Christian nationalist and very right wing - he supports the lie that Trump actually won the election. Does he have plans to change college and universities if he's elected as governor? BUNCH: Well, he's very focused. I mean, he wants to radically change K-12 education. But I think cuts in college would almost - in college funding by the state would almost certainly come with that. You know, Mastriano and other Republicans this year tried to drastically cut state support for universities like Temple and the University of Pittsburgh that get state aid. And the reason for this was largely a controversy at Pittsburgh over stem cell research that it does. So you know, you saw this bleeding of the growing issue over reproductive rights and abortion intersecting with the whole issue of college funding. And, you know, it just kind of shows where the far-right movement in this country is headed. GROSS: You mentioned that Mastriano has plans for K-12. And you wrote a column about that recently in which you wrote that, you know, he'd like to cut state aid to public schools by more than half, with parents able to use those dollars for religious schools or homeschooling. Can you expand on what's behind that? BUNCH: I think the big reason the right is so obsessed about education comes out of the George Floyd protests from the spring of 2020. I think the size of those protests, the fact that in a lot of kind of small and mid-sized towns and cities in areas that you might normally call Trump country, you had big turnout suddenly for Black Lives Matter marches. And these marches were populated largely by high school students or high school teachers, right? They were a core of this movement. And I think it made people on the right wonder, what is it that our kids are being taught in school that they're embracing this different philosophy about race and this different philosophy about hierarchies in America that wasn't the one that I grew up with? And so, you know, you've seen this intense focus on, what are kids learning about race? What are kids learning about gender? What are they learning about the LGBTQ community? And, you know, it's interesting because I think it's an evolution, you know? In the 1960s and '70s, conservatives were worried about what kids were doing on college campuses. And now they're starting to think that we need to nip some of these critical thinking ideas in the bud when these kids are in grade school. And, you know, that's become the next battleground. GROSS: Well, Will Bunch, I want to thank you a lot for talking with us. BUNCH: Thanks so much for having me, Terry. I really appreciate it. GROSS: Will Bunch is a columnist for the Philadelphia Inquirer and author of the new book \"After The Ivory Tower Falls: How College Broke The American Dream And Blew Up Our Politics - And How To Fix It.\" After we take a short break, Nick Quah will review two podcasts that take us back to the period of the counterculture.

Most users they spoke with see the commodification of their personal data as a tradeoff they're forced to make. Health apps can be a great way to stay on top of your health. They let users keep track of things like their exercise, mental health, menstrual cycles \u2014 even the quality of their skin. But health researchers Giulia De Togni and Andrea Ford have found that many of these health apps also have a dark side \u2014 selling your most personal data to third parties like advertisers, insurers and tech companies.

Their rebuttal to all this surveillance, of the commodification of our behaviors as users is simple: personal empowerment and regulation. Email us at shortwave@npr.org.
