            "article_content": "The climate summit continues in Glasgow, Scotland. The Supreme Court heard two challenges to the Texas abortion law. Virginia voters will cast ballots in a tight governor's race.  NOEL KING, HOST: At the U.N. Climate Summit in Scotland yesterday, world leaders got on stage one by one to talk about the threat of climate change and what they plan to do about it. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: They'd already submitted the broad strokes of their plans in writing, so nobody really expected surprises. And then there was one from the third-biggest source of the world's greenhouse gases, India. KING: NPR's Dan Charles is in Scotland. Good morning, Dan. DAN CHARLES, BYLINE: Good morning. KING: What was this big surprise announcement from India? CHARLES: Yeah, so India's prime minister, Narendra Modi, has a dramatic stage presence with his white beard. He was looking very stern yesterday making these announcements. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRIME MINISTER NARENDRA MODI: (Non-English language spoken). CHARLES: So one headline, he said India will reach net zero greenhouse emissions by 2070. KING: 2070 is 49 years away. But India is a giant economy and a giant country. CHARLES: Right. So a lot of experts are saying this is more significant than it looks. Other countries are saying they'll get to net zero faster, but India really depends on its huge deposits of coal. And Ulka Kelkar, who's with the World Resources Institute in India, says it's a huge shift having Prime Minister Modi even mention this idea, that net zero emissions are even possible for India. ULKA KELKAR: Just six months ago, nobody was talking about net zero. Now it's on the front pages of business newspapers and on prime-time national television. CHARLES: And there's also other things. Modi laid out some near-term targets. By 2030, he said, 10 years away, India will have a huge amount of clean electricity generation installed. Fifty percent of its energy will come from renewable sources. What exactly is included in those numbers is not really clear, but Kelkar says it clearly means a huge expansion of wind and solar power. KING: And that's within the next 10 years. CHARLES: Right. Which, is significant. Environmental advocates are saying this is a lot more specific than what's coming from, say, Australia, which says it'll be carbon neutral by 2050 but isn't laying out specific policies to get there. KING: OK. So India is remarkably on the ball at this summit. President Biden was there, too. He was making a speech to promote his climate spending bills, which he wants Congress to approve. Did he have anything to say that is not related to the messiness in Congress? CHARLES: Well, the Biden administration is making a couple of big announcements today here on methane. KING: Methane is the main ingredient in natural gas. CHARLES: Right. It's burned as fuel in everything from big power plants to the gas range in your kitchen releasing carbon dioxide. But methane by itself is the second-most important greenhouse gas behind carbon dioxide. Some climate scientists think we ought to be focusing a lot more on it. Well, the Biden administration is announcing a big new push to cut down on methane emissions. KING: Where do the methane emissions come from? You mentioned the gas range in my kitchen. Are there bigger sources, though? CHARLES: Well, from oil and gas wells, for one thing, but also landfills from manure pits at hog farms and dairies. But the most new and interesting thing about this initiative is it's focusing on the gas pipes that go from house to house in cities. Some of that infrastructure seems to be leaky. There was a scientific study recently that said, like, in Boston, 2.5% of all the gas delivered to that area actually leaked into the atmosphere. KING: Wow. CHARLES: So the administration is coming up with regulations or financial incentives that will cut back on all these methane sources. KING: But interestingly, that's not part of these climate negotiations. CHARLES: No, that's the thing about this event. A lot of things are going on. You know, governments and businesses are just using the occasion to announce things. It'll go on all week. There's a global methane pledge. There's a big announcement today about deforestation. There are more of these announcements than I can even keep track of. KING: OK. Announcements - we'll see if there's action. NPR's Dan Charles in Glasgow. Thank you, Dan. CHARLES: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) KING: All right. Today is Election Day in Virginia. INSKEEP: The race for governor there is very tight and may be telling. Virginia's odd-year elections are often seen as representative of national trends. Democrat Terry McAuliffe was governor once before and campaigned on his past performance. Republican Glenn Youngkin is a former private equity CEO who picked up Republican criticism of schools, often criticizing them for things the schools don't teach. KING: Ben Paviour covers state politics at member station VPM in Richmond. Good morning, Ben. BEN PAVIOUR, BYLINE: Good to be here. KING: All right. So it's the last couple of hours for these candidates before the vote. What are they saying? PAVIOUR: The overriding message from the candidates is just vote. These off-year elections usually don't get the same level of turnout as presidential or even midterm ones. We did see very different strategies for animating the base. For Youngkin, that means drawing on conservative anxieties around education. At a packed rally at an airport hangar, he first cited Martin Luther King Jr., saying we should judge people based on their character, not race. Then he said schools were teaching students to view everything through the lens of race. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) GLENN YOUNGKIN: And so on day one, I will ban critical race theory from being in our schools. (CHEERING) PAVIOUR: It's worth noting here that critical race theory isn't actually in Virginia's K-12 curriculum. KING: OK, so he's going to ban a thing that isn't happening. Is Terry McAuliffe, the Democrat, even bothering to respond to that? Or do people in Virginia get it, like, this is not real? PAVIOUR: He says what you just did. And he says that banning critical race theory is also, quote, \"a racist dog whistle.\" He also spent a lot of this rally at a Richmond brewery talking up what he could claim as his earlier accomplishments in the governor's office. That includes things like restoring voting rights for felons and increasing funding for education. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TERRY MCAULIFFE: So all I'm trying to say is when you give Democrats the power, good things happen. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Yes. MCAULIFFE: Right? PAVIOUR: And he also spent a lot of time connecting Youngkin to former President Trump, who lost Virginia twice. When he was trying to win the Republican nomination, Youngkin's only real campaign issue was promoting what he called election integrity, and Trump endorsed Youngkin as recently as last night in a phone call that was described as a telle-rally. McAuliffe is making the argument that Youngkin is a kind of Trump enabler. KING: Ben, why is Virginia reflective of the national political mood? PAVIOUR: Well, both parties are using it as kind of a staging ground and testing strategies for next year. For Democrats, one big question is whether Trump is still a motivator to get their base out and vote even when he's not actually on the ballot. I'd also say Democrats passed a lot of their priorities in Virginia, things they want to do nationally, like expand access to voting and raise the minimum wage. So there's also the question of how voters respond to Democrats' narrow control of Richmond and Capitol Hill, too. And I think for Republicans, they're looking at Youngkin for maybe a way to win over the MAGA faithful without making the election too much about Trump himself. And they're testing messaging here around critical race theory and school curriculum. KING: OK. Ben Paviour covers state politics for VPM in Richmond. Thank you, Ben. PAVIOUR: Thanks for having me. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) KING: Texas' strict new abortion law has a unique method of enforcement. Instead of officials enforcing it, ordinary people will report on and then sue each other. INSKEEP: We've reported on the reason for this. The law bans abortions after six weeks, which is flatly unconstitutional, so officials can't enforce it. Instead, random people anywhere in the country are encouraged to sue. Reproductive rights advocates and the Biden administration challenge that law. And the Supreme Court yesterday heard arguments. So how did those arguments sound from Texas? KING: Ashley Lopez is with member station KUT in Austin. Good morning, Ashley. ASHLEY LOPEZ, BYLINE: Good morning. KING: What did the justices hear yesterday? LOPEZ: Well, these hearings were actually pretty limited in scope. They were mostly focused on this way that Texas is enforcing its ban by having private citizens sue people who provide or even help provide an abortion to someone passed that six-week limit. This enforcement mechanism has actually made it really hard for folks like abortion providers to challenge this in court because it's been difficult for them to figure out who to sue to stop from enforcing the law since basically anyone can. So the justices are weighing in on whether the state should even be allowed to do this. KING: And what did abortion providers or their attorneys say yesterday? And what did the justices want to know from them? LOPEZ: So after the hearing, attorneys representing the abortion providers said they thought a lot of the questions, including from some of the more conservative members like Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett, indicated that they had some concerns about how this law seems to skirt the courts. One of the lawyers is Julie Murray with Planned Parenthood. She says this could be a good sign for plaintiffs, but it doesn't change the fact that the same court has refused to temporarily block the law while these legal challenges continue. JULIE MURRAY: Certainly, you know, we are heartened by the vigorous questioning of today's hearing. But the reality on the ground is that until SB 8 is stopped with some sort of injunction, patients are still suffering irreparable harm. LOPEZ: Murray pointed out that it's now been more than 60 days during which Texas has had very different abortion rights than the rest of the country. And it's not clear whether yesterday's hearing might convince the justices to change their minds and block the law even temporarily. KING: And so what are anti-abortion groups in Texas telling you about these hearings? LOPEZ: I talked to John Seago with Texas Right to Life. He said he was glad to see that the court seemed skeptical about the suit brought by the Justice Department. I think one of the big takeaways by legal observers is that the court seems more inclined to allow the suit brought by the abortion providers to move forward compared to the case brought by the federal government. But either way, anti-abortion groups continue to claim a big victory in the fact that the law has stayed in effect throughout all of this back and forth in the courts. And John Seago told me he thinks the court will probably keep the law in place despite any concerns about how this law was crafted. JOHN SEAGO: So we believe that's going to be the case is that no matter how they rule on these standings, the jurisdiction questions for the case to move forward, they seem to be in a position to allow the law to stay in effect. LOPEZ: And, you know, for their part, abortion providers in Texas are really concerned about what will happen to clinics and abortion access in the state if this law is allowed to stay in effect, even if it's just a little longer. The longer it stays in effect, the more of a financial crunch they face because the majority of the people coming to them for an abortion are no longer able to receive one. And they say this could eventually lead to many clinics to shut down indefinitely and maybe forever. And when we've seen past abortion laws go into effect in Texas, when clinics shut down, it's very hard for them to come back. KING: OK. Thank you, Ashley. LOPEZ: Thank you.

            "article_content": "Former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a Democrat running for a second term, answers questions from the media after touring Whole Woman's Health of Charlottesville on Sept. 9. He's working to rally voters in response to Texas' restrictive new abortion law.\n                \n                    \n                    Win McNamee/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a Democrat running for a second term, answers questions from the media after touring Whole Woman's Health of Charlottesville on Sept. 9. He's working to rally voters in response to Texas' restrictive new abortion law. Morgan Byrd said that had it not been for the restrictive new Texas abortion law, she probably wouldn't have signed up to volunteer to canvass for Planned Parenthood. \"I wish I could say that I would have, but no \u2014 this is really the far stretch that's kind of encouraging me to stand up more,\" she said. \"This is telling me I need to be out there. I need to be spreading the word.\" Byrd was part of a small group of volunteers who met outside a cafe in Arlington, Va., this month to learn about canvassing for the abortion-rights group. Early voting is already underway in Virginia's election, ahead of Election Day in November, and at the top of the ticket is the governor's race \u2014 the first major competitive contest since Texas' new abortion restrictions went into effect. For Democrats, it's also a major test of how much opposition to that law might motivate voters, even if they don't live in Texas, ahead of next year's elections, where control of Congress will be decided. The Virginia race pits former Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe against Republican nominee Glenn Youngkin, the former CEO of the Carlyle Group private equity firm. The Texas law has made abortion a bigger issue than it already was in the campaign. Abortion-rights opponents have been displeased with outgoing Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam. Then, a July video posted by a website called the American Independent raised the temperature of the state's abortion debate. It shows Youngkin telling a woman posing as an abortion-rights opponent that talking about restricting abortion will make winning harder. \"When I'm governor and I have a majority in the House, we can start going on offense,\" he said. \"But as a campaign topic, sadly, that in fact won't win my independent votes that I have to get.\" McAuliffe has plastered the video of Youngkin across local television markets in campaign ads. McAuliffe has emphasized his support of abortion rights and said he would sign a law making it easier to get a third-trimester abortion if the patient's life is in danger. Youngkin, meanwhile, has said he wouldn't sign a law like the one in Texas, which bans abortions after about six weeks and furthermore rewards citizens for successfully filing suit against people who break that law. He also dodged a question about whether he'd sign a \"fetal heartbeat\" bill but did say that he supports a \"pain threshold bill.\" Those types of bills ban abortion after 20 weeks. And both candidates have worked to paint each other's positions as extreme, a logical tactic given that Americans' views on abortion largely exist somewhere between the two furthest poles in the debate. A plurality of Americans, 48%, believe abortion should be legal in some circumstances, according to Gallup. Meanwhile, around one-third believe it should always be legal, and one-fifth believe it should always be illegal. However, their tactics differ in the fact that Youngkin is not embracing the issue as much as McAuliffe. \"It speaks to a pretty familiar idea in politics that the side that feels more threatened by something is probably the one that gets more motivation out of it,\" said Kyle Kondik, a political analyst at the University of Virginia. \"And so the side that maybe feels more threatened that the abortion status quo is going to change is the Democrats right now.\" Virginia Republican gubernatorial candidate Glenn Youngkin bags groceries for a customer during a campaign stop at Hispanic-owned supermarket Todos on Sept. 15 in Woodbridge, Va. Youngkin is trying to make inflation a focus of the campaign, pledging to repeal Virginia's grocery tax.\n                \n                    \n                    Alex Wong/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Virginia Republican gubernatorial candidate Glenn Youngkin bags groceries for a customer during a campaign stop at Hispanic-owned supermarket Todos on Sept. 15 in Woodbridge, Va. Youngkin is trying to make inflation a focus of the campaign, pledging to repeal Virginia's grocery tax. The types of events the candidates have been holding show how they're attempting to frame the race. McAuliffe toured a Charlottesville abortion clinic just over a week after Texas' law went into effect. \"This is so un-American. This is pitting neighbors against neighbors, friends against friends. It is just outrageous,\" he said. \"And that can come here to Virginia.\" Youngkin, meanwhile, has been striving to make the race about the economy, and inflation in particular, which he emphasized as he greeted shoppers at a grocery store in Woodbridge. \"One of the things I want to do if I'm elected governor is I want to eliminate the grocery tax,\" he said as he greeted a shopper at the bakery counter. \"Amen,\" the man responded. The state's 2.5% grocery tax has become a centerpiece of Youngkin's campaign. Highlighting inflation is a tactic other Republicans appear primed to use as well in their midterm races. Youngkin is keeping the race competitive in a state that has become reliable for Democrats. A new poll from The Washington Post and the Schar School of Policy and Government at George Mason University found Youngkin and McAuliffe nearly tied among likely voters. Abortion tends to be an important topic to a lot of voters, but it's the most important topic to only a small share \u2014 that latest poll from the Post finds that 9% of voters have abortion as their top issue. But that small share matters in a tight race, says Olivia Gans Turner, president of the Virginia Society for Human Life, which advocates against abortion rights. \"When you have a race as tight as this and we motivate the pro-life vote to get out [and] do what they can do, the Democrats should be afraid,\" she said. \"Because that's going to matter in this election.\" Then again, abortion can motivate a voter even without it being the person's top issue. Which brings us back to Morgan Byrd, the new Planned Parenthood canvasser. NPR asked her what she cares about most in this election: \"I'd say for the state of Virginia, it's probably not reproductive rights, because I have a little bit more faith in them and our leaders,\" she said. \"So I'd say maybe things like climate change and things like that.\" But it was abortion rights that got her out to volunteer. And still more galvanizing abortion decisions could be on the way, right in the middle of the midterm campaign. Next year, the conservative Supreme Court is set to rule on a Mississippi abortion ban.",

In Texas, 666 new laws go into effect Wednesday passed by the Republican-led state Legislature in the 2021 regular session. Among them are top conservative priorities passed in other red states around the country this year, but none as big as Texas with more than 29 million residents. Meanwhile, Texas Democrats have returned to the state after leaving to protest a restrictive voting law. That bill eventually passed Tuesday but won't immediately become law. Here are some of the major new laws that do take effect Wednesday in Texas: The Texas voting bill that's gained the most attention this year is the GOP-backed Senate Bill 1, which passed this week. It still needs Gov. Greg Abbott's signature, but some less-talked-about-voting laws take effect Wednesday. One bans Texas voters from registering using a post office box as their address, another allows the secretary of state to cut funds for voter registrars that fail to remove certain people from the rolls, and one more makes it harder to apply for a mail-in ballot for medical reasons. There are also other, less controversial voting laws. One allows people to track their mail-in ballots, and another makes it clear who can be in a polling place: voters, election workers, poll watchers, election judges and law enforcement. A protester holds a sign outside the Texas Capitol on May 29 in Austin. Protesters came out in response to a bill outlawing abortions after cardiac activity is detected in an embryo, sometimes by six weeks of pregnancy.\n                \n                    \n                    Sergio Flores/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption A protester holds a sign outside the Texas Capitol on May 29 in Austin. Protesters came out in response to a bill outlawing abortions after cardiac activity is detected in an embryo, sometimes by six weeks of pregnancy. Texas' new abortion law, which went into effect Wednesday after the U.S. Supreme Court did not weigh in, could prevent the vast majority of abortions in the state. It prohibits abortions once cardiac activity is detected in an embryo. That can happen as early as about six weeks, before many people even know they are pregnant. Unlike other similar bills across the country, Texas' law doesn't set criminal penalties for violating the ban. Instead, the law allows private citizens to sue anyone who helps someone get an abortion. Abortion rights advocates have asked the U.S. Supreme Court to block the law, but the justices haven't acted yet. \"Anti-abortion protesters could use this law to harass clinics with endless lawsuits that consume their time and resources and could force them to shut down,\" Marc Hearron, the lead attorney for plaintiffs in the case, told reporters in July. Teachers say they don't teach it. Educators say most people \u2014 including critics \u2014 don't know what it is. Still, this spring lawmakers passed laws banning the teaching of critical race theory in schools. Nikki Jones, who teaches African American studies at the University of California, Berkeley, described critical race theory as a way to understand how race has been used to influence laws in the United States. \"It's a way to see race,\" Jones says, \"to see understandings of race, to see racism, in places where it may not otherwise on the surface of it be apparent.\" The new law takes on critical race theory without ever naming it. House bill sponsor Rep. Steve Toth, a Republican, says the new law is aimed at teaching complex subjects such as slavery and racism without making white children feel guilty. \"We need to teach about the ills, but you can't blame this generation,\" Toth says. \"Kids are being scapegoated.\" Texas history teachers say they don't scapegoat anyone. Texas protesters could face felony charges for blocking a roadway or entrance to a hospital after a new law takes effect Wednesday. The bill was introduced after a demonstration in California that resulted in protesters blocking two deputies from entering an emergency room. In Texas, protesters had faced a misdemeanor with up to six months in jail for that offense. The new law increases the penalty to two years. \"As a nurse who's worked in the emergency setting, seconds matter,\" says Republican state Rep. Stephanie Klick, one of the bill's authors. \"A delay of only a few minutes to emergency care can mean the difference between life and death.\" But Democratic state Rep. Joe Moody of El Paso says the punishment is too severe. \"What we're doing here is creating a mandatory minimum that is not congruent to anything else that we have,\" Moody says.

Texans have had the right to carry a gun in public since 1995. Since then, more gun-friendly legislation has followed. However, Texans have always needed to obtain a license to be able to take a gun outside their home or vehicle. Starting Wednesday, that's no longer the case. The new law allows anyone who can legally own a firearm to carry it in public, as long as it's in a holster. That's a first since Reconstruction. Texas is now the 20th state to enact what some call \"constitutional carry\" \u2014 something supporters say is a right granted by the Second Amendment. The law doesn't change eligibility for gun ownership. Texas handgun owners must still be at least 21 years old and cannot have served a sentence for a felony or family violence within the last five years. And the new law also adds several misdemeanors to the list, including assault causing bodily injury, deadly conduct, terroristic threat and disorderly conduct with a firearm. The law is unpopular among some Texas law enforcement, and according to April polling data from the University of Texas and The Texas Tribune, nearly 60% of Texans oppose permitless carry. \"I think it will mean more handguns in public,\" says Gyl Switzer, executive director of Texas Gun Sense. \"And data show us time, after time, after time that guns don't make us safer.\" Another new law would ban homeless encampments across the state, making it illegal to set up shelter or store belongings for an extended period of time, creating a new class C misdemeanor punishable by a fine of up to $500. Many believe the legislation is a response to Austin decriminalizing homeless camping in 2019 \u2014 a measure that Austin voters voted to overturn in May. The law also limits cities from using parks for temporary camps. Thousands more Texans will become eligible Wednesday for low-THC medical cannabis oil through the state's compassionate use program. The new law makes all forms of cancer eligible for the program. Previously, only patients suffering from terminal cancer were eligible. \"It's arguable that any form of cancer could be terminal, right?\" says Jax Finkel, executive director of Texas National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws. \"So it felt like a very arbitrary descriptor.\" It also expands use for people suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. Originally, only veterans were eligible. That was changed, in part, after an outpouring of support from veterans who testified that everyone with PTSD should have the same access. The state's program, though, remains one of the most restrictive in the country. According to a poll this year from the University of Texas and the Texas Tribune, just more than 10% of Texans believe marijuana should remain illegal in the state. A new law could help the roughly 1.5 million veterans living in Texas get academic credit for skills they learned in the military by creating a universal catalog to translate which military training would apply to certain degrees and certificate programs at Texas trade schools and colleges. Democratic state Rep. Alex Dominguez, who co-authored the bill, says it was about reducing redundancy for veterans and giving them quicker entry into the civilian workforce. \"My goal is to publish this list so that the veterans themselves can see what they would qualify for,\" Dominguez says. \"A veteran might be leaving military service having always done work in, say, infantry, but they might notice that they have developed enough skills that would help them get a job in, say, law enforcement, or to be a paramedic, for example.\" Houston Public Media's Andrew Schneider and Florian Martin; KERA's Bret Jaspers, Haya Panjwani, Ana Perez and Bill Zeeble; KUT's Ashley Lopez, Jerry Quijano and Andrew Weber; and Texas Public Radio's Carolina Cuellar and Jack Morgan contributed to this report.",

The Vatican's top enforcer of doctrine has sent a warning to U.S. bishops about a potential proposal by some conservative clergy to deny communion to Catholic elected officials who support legislation allowing abortion. The possible plan could affect President Biden, among other Catholic political figures. The president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, Archbishop Jos\u00e9 Gomez, previously informed the doctrinal office that U.S. bishops were preparing at their June meeting to draw up a document addressing \"the situation of Catholics in public office who support legislation allowing abortion, euthanasia and other moral evils.\" In a letter dated May 7, the head of the Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (CDF), Cardinal Luis Ladaria told Gomez that any such policy requires dialogue first among bishops themselves and then between bishops and Catholic politicians who support abortion rights \u2014 whom the cardinal specifically identified as \"pro-choice.\" The letter was first reported Monday by Catholic News Service and the Jesuit magazine America. U.S. bishops are divided over this issue. Some of the more conservative bishops, such as San Francisco Archbishop Salvatore Cordileone, are calling for Biden and other Catholic elected officials to be denied communion due to their position on abortion. Others are opposed to the idea, including San Diego Bishop Robert McElroy, who has warned that \"the Eucharist is being weaponized and deployed as a tool in political warfare.\" Cardinal Wilton Gregory, archbishop of Washington, D.C., has previously said he will not deny communion to Biden. In his letter, Ladaria said it would be misleading to present abortion and euthanasia as \"the only grave matters of Catholic moral and social teaching that demand the fullest accountability on the part of Catholics.\" And he warned that if U.S. church leaders fail to reach a unanimous decision, a national policy, \"given its contentious nature,\" could become a source of discord within the American church. Commenting on Ladaria's letter in the National Catholic Reporter, columnist Michael Sean Winters said the head of the CDF \"gave a tutorial in what it means to be a bishop\" and the letter \"effectively derails\" plans to deny communion to Biden. Biden's election was welcomed by the Vatican \u2013 which made no mention of his support for abortion rights. And the Holy See was reportedly annoyed by a U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops statement from Gomez on Inauguration Day lamenting that \"our new president has pledged to pursue certain policies that would advance moral evils and threaten human life and dignity, most seriously in the areas of abortion, contraception, marriage, and gender.\" That statement added that \"for the nation's bishops, the continued injustice of abortion remains the preeminent priority.\" An unnamed senior Vatican official told America that the Inauguration Day statement \"is most unfortunate and is likely to create even greater divisions within the Church in the United States.\" Along with Biden, there are 158 Catholics in Congress, most of them Democrats who favor abortion rights, and six Catholic Supreme Court justices, most of them anti-abortion Republicans. \"In the 2020 presidential election, Catholic voters split their votes almost evenly between Biden and Republican Donald Trump,\" according to The Associated Press. \"National polls have consistently shown that a majority of U.S. Catholics believe abortion should be legal in at least some cases.\"",

Joe Biden is only the second Catholic president of the United States. He's also a supporter of abortion rights \u2014 a position at odds with official teachings of the Roman Catholic Church. For some Catholic activists, like Marjorie Dannenfelser, Biden's high-profile example of a Catholic who supports abortion rights is troubling. \"It's a negative example of a deep and important moral issue that is being debated in this country,\" she said. For some, a challenge; for others, an opportunity Dannenfelser is president of the Susan B. Anthony List, a group that works to elect national politicians who are opposed to abortion rights and to advocate for laws limiting abortion. She's particularly concerned about Biden's embrace of a broader push among Democrats to repeal the Hyde Amendment, which prohibits federal funding for most abortions. He took that position in 2019, while running for the Democratic presidential nomination, after decades of supporting the amendment. \"The church itself has not changed in its view, ever, on the dignity of human life and the need for its protection,\" Dannenfelser said. \"[Biden] can't bring the Catholic Church along with him because of his political needs.\" But for those who would like to see the church take a more permissive stance on issues including abortion, Biden's election is an opportunity. Jamie Manson, president of Catholics for Choice, said she hopes for what she describes as a \"better dialogue\" between church leaders and some rank-and-file Catholics who disagree with aspects of the church's teachings. \"There are many issues in which Catholics are dissenting from the bishops and seeing that these are complex moral issues, whether it's same-sex marriage, whether it's contraception, or whether it's abortion,\" she said. On abortion, a divide between clergy and laity Polling suggests a majority of American Catholics support abortion rights in most or all cases and oppose overturning Roe v. Wade, the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion nationwide. According to the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports abortion rights, most Catholic women say they've used contraception at some point, which the church also opposes. With a conservative Supreme Court majority and Biden in the White House, Manson predicts continued battles over issues including \"conscience exemptions\" \u2014 for example, for pharmacists who object to dispensing the morning-after pill or employers who oppose including contraceptive coverage in their health insurance plans. \"What I hope one of the impacts on policy will be is to say, 'Listen, that is not what religious freedom is about; religious freedom is about no one being oppressed or having their civil rights lost because of individual religious beliefs,' \" Manson said. A \"devout Catholic\" president Conservative Catholics, meanwhile, worry that Biden will roll back Trump administration policies that they've seen as victories for religious liberty or the goal of restricting abortion. During the first White House press briefing of the Biden administration, a reporter from the Catholic network EWTN asked press secretary Jen Psaki about Biden's abortion policies, including the Hyde Amendment. \"I will just take the opportunity to remind all of you that he is a devout Catholic, and somebody who attends church regularly. He started his day attending church with his family this morning,\" Psaki said, adding that she had nothing more specific to say at the time. Already, the administration has said Biden is preparing to reverse the Mexico City Policy, which prohibits U.S. funding for organizations that perform or refer patients for abortions in other countries. But a study in the journal The Lancet found that the policy actually increased the abortion rate in some countries, most likely because it also reduced access to contraception. \"So I think that Biden, from a policy perspective, is going to do things that end up reducing the number of abortions,\" said Natalia Imperatori-Lee, a progressive Catholic theologian and religious studies professor at Manhattan College in New York. The Communion debate Some Catholics who oppose abortion argue for denying Communion to Roman Catholic politicians who publicly support abortion rights \u2014 an action some priests have taken against Biden, Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin and others. Mary Hasson, a fellow at the conservative-leaning Ethics and Public Policy Center, said that's a decision best left to the clergy. \"But I will say, it is really problematic when you have a Catholic \u2014 the most prominent Catholic in the country, which is what President Biden is \u2014 taking this stand that he is in favor of abortion \u2014 which the church says is a grave moral evil; it's the killing of defenseless, unborn, vulnerable human life \u2014 and then presenting himself for Communion,\" Hasson said. However divided the rank and file, the church's position remains the same. In a statement released on Inauguration Day, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops praised Biden's \"piety\" but expressed \"deep concern\" about several of his positions that the bishops say \"would advance moral evils\" \u2014 including his support for abortion rights.",

            "article_content": "Democrats are trying to galvanize voters in favor of abortion rights after Texas Republicans enacted controversial new restrictions. Their first major test is in Virginia's race for governor.  LEILA FADEL, HOST: Early voting is already underway in Virginia's November race for governor. It's the first major competitive election since Texas' restrictive new abortion law went into effect. For Democrats, it's also a major test of how much opposition to that law might motivate voters, even if they don't live in Texas. NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben reports. DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN, BYLINE: On a warm evening outside a cafe in Arlington, Va., Planned Parenthood workers were handing out fuchsia T-shirts for canvassers. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Another pink shirt? UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Sure. Yes. KURTZLEBEN: Around a dozen volunteers came to this Washington, D.C., suburb a week after Texas' new restrictive abortion law went into effect. One of them, Morgan Byrd, said that had it not been for Texas, she probably wouldn't have signed up. MORGAN BYRD: I wish I could say that I would have, but no. This is really the far stretch that's kind of encouraging me to stand up more. This is telling me I need to be out there. I need to be spreading the word. KURTZLEBEN: Spreading the word for pro-abortion rights candidates like Terry McAuliffe, that is. The former Democratic governor is running again against Republican nominee Glenn Youngkin, the former CEO of private equity firm The Carlyle Group. A video posted by a site called The American Independent in July raised the temperature on the state's abortion debate. It shows Youngkin saying that talking about restricting abortion will make winning harder. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) GLENN YOUNGKIN: When I'm governor and I have a majority in the House, we can start going on offense. But as a campaign topic, sadly, that in fact won't win my independent votes that I have to get. KURTZLEBEN: In his ads, McAuliffe has plastered that video across local television markets. The Democrat emphasizes his support of abortion rights and said in a debate last week he would sign a law making it easier to get a third-trimester abortion if the patient's life was in danger. Youngkin, meanwhile, has said he wouldn't sign a law like Texas', which bans abortions after six weeks and furthermore rewards citizens for successfully filing suit against people who break that law. He said in the debate that he supports a pain threshold bill. Those types of bills ban abortion after 20 weeks. But Youngkin is not embracing the issue as much as McAuliffe, which makes sense to Kyle Kondik, a political analyst at the University of Virginia. KYLE KONDIK: I think it speaks to, I think, a pretty familiar idea in politics that the side that feels more threatened by something is probably the one that gets more motivation out of it. KURTZLEBEN: Recently, for example, McAuliffe toured a Charlottesville abortion clinic and spoke to reporters about Texas' law. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TERRY MCAULIFFE: This is so un-American. This is pitting neighbors against neighbors, friends against friends. It is just outrageous. And that can come here to Virginia. KURTZLEBEN: Youngkin, meanwhile, has been striving to make the race about the economy and inflation in particular, which he emphasized as he greeted shoppers at a grocery store in Woodbridge. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) YOUNGKIN: One of the things I want to do if I'm elected governor is I want to eliminate the grocery tax. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: Amen. YOUNGKIN: Because we shouldn't tax (inaudible). UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: Awesome. Awesome. YOUNGKIN: We're going to bring costs down for people. KURTZLEBEN: The Republican Youngkin is keeping the race competitive in a state that has become reliable for Democrats. A weekend poll from The Washington Post and the Schar School at George Mason University found Youngkin and McAuliffe nearly tied among likely voters. Reproductive rights tends to be an important topic to a lot of voters, but it's only the most important topic to a small sliver of voters. But that sliver matters in a tight race, says Olivia Gans Turner, president of the Virginia Society for Human Life, which advocates against abortion rights. OLIVIA GANS TURNER: When you have a race as tight as this and we motivate the pro-life vote to get out and do what they can do, the Democrats should be afraid because that's going to matter in this election. KURTZLEBEN: Then again, abortion can motivate a voter even without it being their top issue. Which brings us back to Morgan Byrd, the new Planned Parenthood canvasser. I asked her what she cares about most in this election. BYRD: I'd say for the state of Virginia, it's probably not reproductive rights just because I have a little bit more faith in them, in our leaders. So I'd say maybe things like climate change and things like that. KURTZLEBEN: But it was abortion rights that got her out to volunteer. And still more galvanizing abortion decisions could be on the way right in the middle of the midterm campaign. Next year, the conservative Supreme Court is set to rule on a Mississippi abortion ban.

So far, more than 700 people have been charged with crimes due to their actions that day. This year was supposed to be one of recovery, but it has been far from that. It began with the insurrection at the Capitol, a second impeachment of then-President Donald Trump and President Biden's inauguration. As the year went on, Trump continued to lie about the election results while he remained one of the most popular figures among Republicans. With new coronavirus variants, the deadly pandemic has continued to drag on. And even though the stock market has boomed and unemployment is down, Americans have felt the pinch of rising prices. Biden has paid the political price, ending the year with his approval ratings at their lowest point since he took office. As we count down to the new year, we asked our readers what they thought were the top political stories of 2021. More than 1,000 responded. Here's what they picked: As he promised on the campaign trail, Biden ended the United States' almost 20-year war in Afghanistan, America's longest war. But the withdrawal of troops was chaotic and deadly with 13 U.S. servicemembers and some 170 Afghans killed in a suicide bombing by the Kabul airport. The U.S. and its Afghan allies didn't foresee the speed at which the Taliban would take control of the country. It has meant a reversal of years of progress for women's rights in Afghanistan, and it hurt U.S. credibility abroad and Biden's credibility at home that he could govern competently.

Multiple one-in-1,000-year events aren't supposed to happen in a single year, but that's exactly what happened in 2021 as the climate continues to change and legislators appear paralyzed to find solutions. And as global emissions and temperatures rise, the number of weather disasters is likely only to increase. This year has seen the Trump wing of the Republican Party continue to be ascendant, led by brash and controversial far-right voices in the House. GOP members like Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Lauren Boebert of Colorado seem more in touch with the base than Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell. The intraparty divisions came to a head with an altered anime video by Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., that portrayed him killing New York Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and attacking Biden with knives. The House censured Gosar, but only two Republicans voted with Democrats \u2014 Liz Cheney of Wyoming and Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, both of whom have already broken with Trump. President Biden and Vice President Harris arrive on the South Lawn of the White House on Nov. 15 for a signing ceremony for the infrastructure bill.\n                \n                    \n                    Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption President Biden and Vice President Harris arrive on the South Lawn of the White House on Nov. 15 for a signing ceremony for the infrastructure bill. They were elected largely in response to Trump and the coronavirus pandemic. Trump was one of the most divisive figures in the history of the office, and Biden ran as something of a panacea. And his running mate, Kamala Harris, was a historic pick: the first woman, first Asian American and first Black vice president. Their supporters saw a brighter day on the horizon, but that would soon dim. Biden was able to get through a COVID-19 relief bill and eventually infrastructure legislation, but Democratic infighting got most of the attention. The right found its footing in opposition to Biden; Biden's popularity hit its lowest point at the end of the year; and Harris' favorability ratings tanked. The duo has to hope for a turnaround in the pandemic and for inflation to recede to turn around their prospects. The Democratic-led congressional committee looking into what happened on Jan. 6 hit its stride toward the end of the year. It issued dozens of subpoenas, held Trump officials who didn't cooperate in contempt, and read explosive text messages from the former president's son and Fox News personalities, all urging Trump's then-chief of staff to get him to call off the insurrection. The clock is ticking on the committee, however, if it hopes to piece together all of what was happening behind the scenes. Republicans are favored to take back control of the House in 2022 and in all likelihood would shut down the investigation. Trump lost the 2020 presidential election, but he was never able to accept that. For a man who built his brand on \"winning,\" losing was unacceptable. He's lost plenty in his life. He's taken businesses into bankruptcy and written off almost $1 billion in losses. But he was always able to spin his way out of those things. That was far more difficult to do with a presidential election. So his only off-ramp was to lie about what happened. Trump has continued to falsely assert that he won when he didn't and managed to convince millions of his followers of the same \u2014 the first time since the Civil War that there wasn't a peaceful transfer of power with both sides accepting the outcome.

The most notable changes have happened in those GOP-led states, like Arizona, Georgia, Florida, Texas, Iowa and Montana. Most of these states enacted an omnibus package with many new restrictions, such as to mail-in voting, all in the name of \"restoring election integrity.\" Some other key states would have joined them, had they not had Democratic governors veto the legislation. More than 800,000 Americans have now died from COVID-19. Biden was close to declaring independence from the coronavirus in July as a result of widespread distribution of the vaccine and dropping case numbers. But the delta variant led to more infections and more restrictions, and fears began to rise again toward the end of the year with the massive surge in cases due to the omicron variant, which has infected many who are vaccinated.

Trump's appointment of three conservative-leaning justices has meant that this year the high court took steps to gut Roe v. Wade. All indications are that it will uphold restrictions, like a 15-week ban in Mississippi, and it has so far let a Texas law stand that has all but shut down access to abortion in the state. No shock here. This was an unprecedented event that capped off a chaotic Trump presidency. A mob of pro-Trump supporters breached the Capitol building and marauded through the halls in an attempt to disrupt the ceremonial counting of states' votes that confirmed Biden's victory in the 2020 election. Despite the violent images broadcast on television, the handful of deaths, 140 members of law enforcement who were injured and more than $1 million in damage as a result, some on the right continue to dismiss what happened, calling it a peaceful protest. So far, more than 700 people have been charged with crimes due to their actions that day.",

SANTIAGO, Chile \u2014 A leftist millennial who rose to prominence during anti-government protests was elected Chile's next president Sunday after a bruising campaign against a free-market firebrand likened to Donald Trump. With more than 90% of polling stations reporting, Gabriel Boric had 56% of the votes, compared to 44% for his opponent, lawmaker Jos\u00e9 Antonio Kast. Kast tweeted a photo of himself on the phone with his opponent congratulating him on his \"grand triumph\" as supporters of Boric gathered in downtown Santiago to celebrate. Outgoing President Sebastian Pinera held a video conference call with Boric to congratulate him. \"I am going to be the president of all Chileans,\" Boric said in the brief televised appearance with Pinera. Boric, 35, will become Chile's youngest modern president when he takes office in March. He was among several activists elected to Congress in 2014 after leading protests for higher quality education. On the stump, he vowed to \"bury\" the neoliberal economic model left by Gen. Augusto Pinochet's 1973-1990 dictatorship and raise taxes on the \"super rich\" to expand social services, fight inequality and boost protections of the environment. Kast, who has a history of defending Chile's past military dictatorship, finished ahead of Boric by two points in the first round of voting last month but failed to secure a majority of votes. That set up a head-to-head runoff against Boric. Boric was able to reverse the difference by a larger margin than even pre-election opinion polls forecast by expanding beyond his base in the capital, Santiago, and attracting voters in rural areas who don't side with political extremes. For example, in the northern region of Antofagasta, where he finished third in the first round of voting, he trounced Kast by almost 20 points. Kast, 55, a devout Roman Catholic and father of nine, emerged from the far right fringe after having won less than 8% of the vote in 2017. He rose steadily in the polls this time with a divisive discourse emphasizing conservative family values and playing on Chileans' fears that a surge in migration \u2014 from Haiti and Venezuela \u2014 is driving crime. A longtime lawmaker, he has a record of attacking Chile's LGBTQ community and advocating more restrictive abortion laws. He also accused outgoing President Sebastian Pinera, a fellow conservative, of betraying the economic legacy of Gen. Augusto Pinochet, the country's former military leader. Kast's brother, Miguel, was one of Pinochet's top advisers. In recent days, both candidates tried to veer toward the center. \"I'm not an extremist. ... I don't feel far right,\" Kast proclaimed in the final stretch even as he was dogged by revelations that his German-born father had been a card-carrying member of Adolf Hitler's Nazi party. Boric, who is backed by a coalition of leftist parties that includes Chile's Communist Party, brought more centrist advisers onto his team and promised that any changes would be gradual and fiscally responsible. \"On both sides, people are voting out of fear,\" Robert Funk, a political scientist at the University of Chile, said before the vote count. \"Neither side is particularly enthused with their candidate but they are voting out of fear that, if Kast wins, there will an authoritarian regression or because they fear Boric is too young, inexperienced and aligned with the communists.\" Boric's victory likely to be tempered by a divided congress. In addition, the political rules could soon change because a newly elected convention is rewriting the country's Pinochet-era constitution.

It's Saturday, and Sarah Mahoney is one of several Planned Parenthood volunteers knocking on doors in Windham, Maine, a politically moderate town not far from Portland. No one answers at the first couple of houses. But as Mahoney heads up the street, she sees a woman out for a walk. \"Hey! We're out canvassing,\" she says. \"Would you mind having a conversation with us?\" This story was produced in partnership with Kaiser Health News. Mahoney wants to talk about abortion \u2014 not a typical topic for a conversation, especially with a stranger. But the woman, Kerry Kelchner, agrees to talk. If this were typical door-to-door canvassing, Mahoney might ask Kelchner about a political candidate, remind her to vote and then be on her way. But Mahoney is deep canvassing \u2014 a technique that employs longer conversations to move opinions on hot-button issues. Planned Parenthood in Maine has deployed the strategy for several years amid what it says are increasing threats to reproductive rights. This year alone, states have enacted more than 100 restrictions on abortion, including one in Texas that bans most abortions after six weeks. This month, the US Supreme Court heard arguments in a case about a Mississippi law that could lead to the overturning of Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 ruling that established a constitutional right to abortion. Although state law in Maine protects abortion rights even if Roe v. Wade is overturned, abortion opponents have gained traction in the state in recent years. So volunteers like Mahoney start conversations. And they can get quite personal. Mahoney first assesses Kelchner's baseline attitude on abortion access on a scale of 0 to 10. A 10 means the interviewee believes anyone should be able to get an abortion for any reason. Kelchner says she's a 7. Next, Mahoney asks Kelchner a series of questions to better understand her values. \"Can you tell me a little bit about what shaped your views on abortion?\" she asks. \"Have you known anybody who's had an abortion, a friend or a family member?\" \"My mother,\" says Kelchner. She explains her parents were young when she was born, and they weren't ready for another baby. Then Mahoney, who's 60, shares that she also had an abortion. \"I was in my early 20s,\" she says. \"I was a little conflicted about it, and I wanted to have a family. I knew I wanted to have a family, but I was in no way ready to do that.\" Mahoney points out that she and Kelchner have similar views on what an unplanned pregnancy can mean. Then she asks her opening question again, to see whether Kelchner's feelings about abortion access have shifted on the 0-to-10 scale. \"Still around 7,\" Kelchner says. Mahoney probes further: \"What would be the circumstances where you would say, 'No \u2014 they shouldn't have the right to have an abortion?'\" Kelchner pauses. \"That's a good question.\" They talk more. Ultimately, Kelchner can't think of any circumstance in which she believes someone should be denied an abortion. \"There should be no judgment,\" she concludes. \"So that would be a 10?\" Mahoney asks. \"Yep,\" says Kelchner. Planned Parenthood organizer Katie McClelland (L) gives a pep talk to volunteers outside the library in Windham, Maine, on Oct. 16. The volunteers then fan out to different neighborhoods to engage in \"deep canvassing\" The goal is to have four conversations with voters over the next two hours.\n                \n                    \n                    Patty Wight/Maine Public Radio\n                    \n                \nhide caption Planned Parenthood organizer Katie McClelland (L) gives a pep talk to volunteers outside the library in Windham, Maine, on Oct. 16. The volunteers then fan out to different neighborhoods to engage in \"deep canvassing\" The goal is to have four conversations with voters over the next two hours. In the five years that she's been deep canvassing for Planned Parenthood, Mahoney says, she hasn't had a single unpleasant conversation. \"What we've found doing this is that it is an effective way to change minds about abortion,\" says Amy Cookson, director of external communications for Planned Parenthood of Northern New England. Cookson says Planned Parenthood started deep canvassing in Maine in 2015, after Paul LePage, an anti-abortion Republican, won a second term as governor. Gay rights advocates in California had used deep canvassing on the same-sex marriage issue, and she wondered: \"Can it work around abortion stigma?\" The technique has been used to garner support for gay marriage, transgender rights, police reform efforts, and for Biden in the 2020 election. Joshua Kalla, a political scientist at Yale University, has conducted research that found the technique can change people's deeply held beliefs. The crucial elements are that canvassers listen without judgment and share their own stories. \"So whether the person had an abortion and is talking about their abortion story,\" says Kalla, \"or whether the person is an ally and is talking about a friend or family member who had an abortion and is sharing that story, the effects seem to be quite similar.\" Kalla has also studied Planned Parenthood's efforts in Maine and says the group has added something else that's effective: moral reframing. Canvassers listen for the moral values a voter emphasizes and then incorporate those values into the story they share. But deep canvassing is not exclusively a progressive tactic, Kalla says. Conservative groups can use it, too, and he thinks that would improve political discourse: \"You know, it would be good for American society if the way we had political conversation was more grounded, and listening to the other side, and being nonjudgmental, and being curious.\" Planned Parenthood volunteer Sarah Mahoney talks to a voter about abortion access outside a home in Windham, Maine on Oct 16, 2021.\n                \n                    \n                    Patty Wight/Maine Public Radio\n                    \n                \nhide caption Planned Parenthood volunteer Sarah Mahoney talks to a voter about abortion access outside a home in Windham, Maine on Oct 16, 2021. Back in Windham, Mahoney continues to walk through the neighborhood. She meets a man outside his apartment building who gives only his first name, Chris. He says he's a 4 on the abortion access scale. He opposes abortion except in cases of sexual assault. Chris tells Mahoney he had a daughter when he was 15. \"Do you talk about, I'm curious, birth control and abortion?\" Mahoney asks. \"I do with her a lot,\" Chris says. She's a teenager, he says, and he's not sure what he'd do if she got pregnant accidentally. \"It's her own life,\" he says. \"I don't know if I would even try to change her mind. Because it's her decision.\" As the conversation goes on, Chris seems as though he supports access to abortion. But at the end, he doesn't budge on his rating. Mahoney says that's OK. Some people won't change their minds right away. \"The worst way to think about this is that it's some kind of Jedi mind trick,\" she says, \"and I'm going to let them talk about themselves and then \u2014 pow! \u2014 I'm going to change their mind.\" What Mahoney wants most from these conversations is for people to think more deeply about the nuances around abortion, and to identify common ground: \"I just feel like we all need to be taking steps to hear one another and move towards each other, instead of just diving into this divisive, contrary, hostile, Red-and-Blue world.\" Because of the success Planned Parenthood in Maine has had with deep canvassing, it has trained volunteers in other states, including Texas and Kansas. Next year, Kansas voters will cast ballots on a referendum question that seeks to revoke abortion access as a fundamental right.

Lisa Murkowski, who voted to convict former President Donald Trump in his second impeachment trial last February, announced Friday she is running for reelection. Murkowski was one of seven Republican senators to vote to convict Trump on charges of insurrection, and the only one seeking reelection next year. It is one example of the ways she has at times bucked her party. In a video announcing her decision, Murkowski asserted that \"lower 48 outsiders are going to try and grab Alaska's Senate seat. ... They couldn't care less about your future.\" That was a thinly veiled shot at her Trump-endorsed GOP opponent, Kelly Tshibaka, former commissioner of Alaska's Department of Administration. The state Republican Party supports Tshibaka, too, and she is slated to hold a fundraiser at Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in February hosted by the former president. But Murkowski has the support of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, and has received campaign contributions from the Bluegrass PAC, aligned with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. Murkowski first entered the Senate in 2002, when her father, former Gov. Frank Murkowski, named her to finish his term in Washington. She has established a reputation for being a moderate independent. She was the only Republican to break ranks to support a voting rights bill pushed by Democrats earlier this month. She also voted for the $1 trillion infrastructure bill, and is one of the few Republicans in the Senate who is an abortion-rights supporter. She won reelection in 2010 running as a write-in candidate, after losing the GOP primary. Alaska now has a nonpartisan primary, and the top four finishers in the state primary will face each other in the general election, which is a ranked-choice vote.",

            "article_content": "Ahead of Tuesday's much-watched and very tight gubernatorial election in Virginia, we hear from voters about what issues are resonating with them \u2014 whether local, national or both.  MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: Out of every election this month, the Virginia race for governor is the one catching the most national attention. That is partly because the race is really tight, which worries Democrats who currently have political control in the state. More than a million Virginians have cast early ballots so far, and we are going to hear what voters are saying about Democrat Terry McAuliffe and Republican Glenn Youngkin. They are the candidates. Joining us is Margaret Barthel. She covers Northern Virginia for member station WAMU. She has been out talking to voters. Hey, Margaret. MARGARET BARTHEL, BYLINE: Hi, Mary Louise. KELLY: So I should be specific - you have been talking with Virginians who have been voting early in Loudoun County, which is a very rapidly growing suburb, very near here - Northern Virginia, just outside Washington. What are they telling you? BARTHEL: Yeah. So Loudoun County, like you said, is this big, increasingly diverse county still somewhat split politically, but it's been more and more reliably blue in recent years. And it's really at the center of a lot of these culture wars - debates over teaching race in schools and school policies designed to protect transgender students. This has come up in the campaign. Glenn Youngkin's closing message in the race is parents matter, which is this kind of catchall phrase that gets at conservative anxiety around those issues. He's also said he'd ban critical race theory from schools, which, I should note, is not actually currently part of the state curriculum standards. But still, some voters have been really energized by the education issue. This is Kevin Sanders (ph), a self-described conservative voter. He told me what he sees as a, quote, \"moral decline\" in schools was what got him out to the polls to vote early. KEVIN SANDERS: Those are issues that are always on my mind because it's not even a local issue, but to see it locally is more disturbing. BARTHEL: So there at least some indications that Republican voters in Virginia are responding to those national talking points. KELLY: And what are you hearing from Democratic voters? What's on their mind? BARTHEL: Yeah, even Democrats acknowledge that these debates over education have really become the centerpiece of the campaign in the final weeks. And, of course, they're pretty frustrated about that. I talked with Juli Briskman. She is a Democratic member of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors. And you may actually also remember her as the woman who lost her job after she flipped off the Trump motorcade in 2017. JULI BRISKMAN: They have succeeded in taking oxygen. So I think the things that are not being talked about are, No. 1, all the progress that we've made in the General Assembly end of Virginia. BARTHEL: And she's referring there to things like expanding Medicaid, expanding access to the ballot itself, the state's COVID response, protecting abortion rights - all things that she believes will be under threat if Republicans win control of the governor's mansion. KELLY: Well, and it's so interesting, Margaret, just listening to you list those issues. Does it seem as though it's national issues, local issues that are more on people's minds and going to get them out to the polls? BARTHEL: Yeah, it's complicated. I mean, some voters were clear with me that there is a distinction between the two in their minds, but I would say that the line is blurrier and blurrier. Even the voters who talked about caring about issues relevant to homeowners or being local community members couldn't really fully avoid talking about the vitriol engulfing the schools. BARTHEL: So - right - so it feels like there's kind of this feedback loop in the election, where something happens at a local school board meeting, and then it goes viral, and then that reaction intensifies things on the ground. KELLY: All righty. Thank you, Margaret. BARTHEL: Thank you. KELLY: Margaret Barthel of our member station WAMU. Copyright \u00a9 2021 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Virginia's off-year elections are often seen as a proxy for national mood in a state President Biden won by 10 points. The race has tightened as Biden's approval ratings have dropped to the lowest point since he took office. Mullis, a former police officer, likes Youngkin's backing of law enforcement. But for many GOP stalwarts gathered at the Flat Rock Country Store, it's as much about the mood as much as the message. Youngkin, a first-time politician, delivers celebrity energy in a fleece vest and cowboy boots. Supporters sign his tour bus and snap photos. Democrats like Biden say Youngkin is just putting a suburban-dad sheen on the policies of former President Donald Trump. Trump has repeatedly endorsed the businessman, and in a tweet late Wednesday, a spokesperson said that Trump would also campaign for him in Virginia. The Youngkin campaign did not respond to requests to comment, but Youngkin previously said he had no plans to campaign with the former president.

Youngkin embraced Trump early in his campaign before pivoting to win over more moderate voters. Youngkin has also campaigned alongside supporters like Republican state Sen. Amanda Chase, who regularly repeats misinformation about the last election and is now making similar unsubstantiated claims in this race. \"Extremism can come in many forms,\" Biden said at a rally for McAuliffe on Tuesday. \"It can come in the rage of a mob driven to assault the Capitol. It can come in a smile in a fleece vest.\" McAuliffe, who served as governor from 2014-2018, has brought a slew of high-profile supporters to hammer home the message that a vote for Youngkin is a vote for Trump. Former President Barack Obama, Vice President Harris and even musician Dave Matthews have made recent appearances in the commonwealth. Youngkin rejects those comparisons. \"If you look at the ballot today, what it says on it is Glenn Youngkin and Terry McAuliffe,\" the former private equity CEO says to cheers at his stop in McKenney. (A third-party candidate, activist Princess Blanding, is also on the ballot.) For Democrats, the stakes are high. Losing Virginia would be a bad sign for next year's midterms. They haven't lost a statewide election in the commonwealth since 2009. McAuliffe says he always knew it would be close. \"I remind you for 44 straight years, the party that wins the White House, the other party wins the governor's mansion,\" McAuliffe said in an interview. \"I'm the only guy to break it.\" McAuliffe was also a wealthy businessman and first-time politician when he won the governor's race in 2013 after a failed attempt in 2009. He had found success as a well-connected Democratic fundraiser known for back-slapping and showy gestures, like wrestling an alligator to win a donation for Jimmy Carter's 1980 reelection campaign. This time, he's running on his record, touting experience he said voters want to see in a pandemic: \"I was governor before, got us out of a horrible financial mess, created a record amount of 200,000 new jobs and made the state open and welcoming,\" he says.

Youngkin has directed his closing message at parents. He channeled conservative outrage over critical race theory, which is not taught in Virginia schools. He often repeats the claims in daily appearances on Fox News, though he's much less available to local press. This week, Youngkin launched a new ad featuring a conservative activist who said her son suffered nightmares after he read Nobel Prize laureate Toni Morrison's Beloved in his AP English class. McAuliffe twice vetoed the so-called \"Beloved bill\" championed by the activist. It would have allowed parents to request new readings for their child if the original included \"sexually explicit content.\" McAuliffe's campaign handed out copies of the book at the Biden event on Tuesday and has called Youngkin's focus on the book \"racist.\" Youngkin denies he's getting into cultural wars. \"It's not Republicans against Democrats anymore,\" he says. \"This is Virginia and standing up for our rights, and particularly for the rights of our kids.\" For some Democrats, the list of worries includes access to abortion and the pandemic. Two volunteers for the party, Elizabeth Balaschak and Gene Miles, kill time at their table outside an early voting location by discussing the impact they might have on the race. Balaschak just moved to the Richmond area from Florida, drawn by Virginia's increasingly blue tint. The backlash to Trump in these suburbs helped Democrats flip the state legislature. They passed a slew of laws, like raising the minimum wage and easing rules on abortion. \"My concern is if it starts to go toward Florida \u2014 I know a lot of people who moved out of Florida over the last few years because of the way the state is going,\" Balaschak says. Balaschak's fellow volunteer, Miles, has noticed lower Democratic enthusiasm this year compared to the Trump era, when attendance at local party committees surged. She's watched Virginia see-saw between parties since she got involved in 1976, calling the state \"a bluish shade of purple.\" Over 850,000 people have already cast early ballots, and some models show Democrats with an edge.

            "article_content": "As the Supreme Court looks to decide on the future of Roe v. Wade, abortion is again one of the biggest social legal questions facing the country. In Montana, three new laws hang in the balance.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: Abortion is once again one of the biggest social and legal debates in the country. Texas has instituted a near-total ban. The U.S. Supreme Court is set to hear arguments out of Mississippi challenging Roe v. Wade. And in Montana, a district court has narrowly halted three new laws restricting abortion just hours before they were set to go into effect. For more on that, we're joined by Shaylee Ragar, Capitol reporter for Montana Public Radio in Helena. Hi, Shaylee. SHAYLEE RAGAR, BYLINE: Hey, Ari. SHAPIRO: Tell us more about what these laws in Montana would have done. RAGAR: Sure. Yeah, several bills passed through the state legislature last spring that ban abortions at 20 weeks, require providers to offer an ultrasound before an abortion and restrict access to medication abortions. And it's worth mentioning that although people often think of Montana as a solid-red state, we actually had a Democrat in the governor's office for the past 16 years. So Republican majority legislatures here have been passing anti-abortion legislation for some time, but those bills were getting vetoed. That all changed in 2020, when Republican Governor Greg Gianforte won election to office and promised to support restricting access to abortion. SHAPIRO: And tell us about the legal challenges to those state laws. RAGAR: Yeah, I don't think it came as a surprise to anyone when Planned Parenthood of Montana filed suit against the state in August. They argue these laws violate Montanans' constitutional right to privacy, free speech of providers and prior legal precedent. They also argue the laws carry hefty penalties for providers but are vague in what constitutes a violation. Planned Parenthood asked the state to temporarily block the three laws I mentioned while the merits of the case are argued in court. Their lawyers say if these laws go into effect before the case is decided, they would cause immediate and irreparable harm that would be hard to undo if the laws are found to be unconstitutional down the line. SHAPIRO: Tell us about the kind of impact that these laws could have on patients in Montana. RAGAR: I talked with Planned Parenthood of Montana's president, Martha Stahl, about this. And for starters, time is always of the essence when it comes to abortion care. So for people who have a plan for how they'll get care and when, these laws would change those plans overnight. Planned Parenthood says that 75% of the abortions they perform in Montana are medication abortions, and providers sometimes prescribe them via telehealth. So if the law prohibiting that practice is allowed to go ahead, it will be especially more difficult for people who live in rural areas seeking abortion care to get it. That law also requires providers to tell patients risks that experts say are exaggerated. So that's another practice that would change overnight. SHAPIRO: We mentioned that a district court has temporarily halted these laws. For how long? RAGAR: Well, the district court ended up granting a temporary restraining order, which has a 10-day expiration date. And it really came down to the wire. That restraining order was signed just six hours before the laws were set to go into effect. But we're still waiting to see if the judge goes further to issue a preliminary injunction on the laws. But if he doesn't do that before Sunday, the policies will go into effect while the case continues. SHAPIRO: So in Montana, the laws are temporarily stalled, unlike Texas. But the urgency between the two states feels similar. How do they compare? RAGAR: So Montana's laws that restrict access to abortion definitely don't go as far as the six-week ban in Texas. And Montana is somewhat unique in that our state constitution has strong protections in place for the right to privacy, which Montana courts in the past have interpreted to explicitly protect access to abortion. But I think the ultimate goal in Montana and Texas is the same. Conservatives want a challenge to Roe v. Wade and for the right to abortion to be overturned. SHAPIRO: Shaylee Ragar, Capitol Reporter for Montana Public Radio, thank you. RAGAR: Thank you, Ari. Copyright \u00a9 2021 NPR.  All rights reserved.

WASHINGTON \u2014 The Biden administration reversed a ban on abortion referrals by family planning clinics, lifting a Trump-era restriction as political and legal battles over abortion grow sharper from Texas to the U.S. Supreme Court. The Department of Health and Human Services said Monday its new regulation will restore the federal family planning program to the way it ran under the Obama administration, when clinics were able to refer women seeking abortions to a provider. The goal is to \"strengthen and restore\" services, said HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra. Groups representing the clinics said they hope the Biden administration action will lead some 1,300 local facilities that left in protest over Trump's policies to return, helping to stabilize a longstanding program shaken by the coronavirus pandemic on top of ideological battles. \"I have heard that almost everywhere in the country people have made the decision that conditions will be good for them to return to the program,\" Clare Coleman, president of the umbrella group National Family Planning & Reproductive Health Association, said in an interview. \"My sense is that people have been waiting for the rule.\" Planned Parenthood, the biggest service provider, said on Twitter its health centers look forward to returning. But the group criticized part of the Biden administration rule that allows individual clinicians who object to abortion not to provide referrals. The administration said that's \"in accordance with applicable federal law.\" Known as Title X, the taxpayer-funded program makes available more than $250 million a year to clinics to provide birth control and basic health care services mainly to low-income women, many of them from minority communities. Under former President Donald Trump, clinics were barred from referring patients for abortions, prompting a mass exit by service providers affiliated with Planned Parenthood, as well as several states and other independent organizations. Women's groups labeled the Trump policy a \"gag rule,\" and medical organizations called it a violation of the clinician-patient relationship. But religious and social conservatives praised the policy for imposing a strict separation between family planning services and abortion. Under federal law, clinics cannot use federal family planning money to pay for abortions. However, abortion opponents argue that birth control funding for organizations like Planned Parenthood, the leading provider of abortions, amounts to an indirect subsidy. On Monday, the National Right to Life Committee criticized the Biden administration for \"supplementing the abortion industry through taxpayer funds.\" Title X family planning clinics served about 3.9 million clients in 2018, but HHS estimates that number fell by nearly 40% after the Trump policy. The upheaval may have led to more than 180,000 unintended pregnancies, the agency said. In all, more than one-quarter of the clinics left the program. Although several states stepped up with their own no-strings-attached funding, women in some parts of the country still lost access. Combined with service disruptions due to COVID-19 shutdowns, \"this has just been a massive one-two punch to the system,\" said Coleman. Biden campaigned on a promise to overturn the restrictions on family planning clinics, but abortion was not a central issue in the 2020 presidential race. It may become one in the 2022 midterm elections to determine who controls Congress. Restrictive state laws in Texas, Mississippi and elsewhere have prompted a mobilization by abortion rights supporters, who fear a conservative-leaning Supreme Court will overturn the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion nationally. Hundreds of abortion-themed protests were held around the country Saturday, including one that brought thousands of abortion rights supporters to the steps of the court. The Supreme Court has allowed the Texas law to take effect, but has not ruled on the substantive legal questions behind that statute, which bans most abortions in the state. The justices will hear arguments Dec. 1 on the Mississippi law, which bans most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy. The court now tilts decidedly to the right after Trump appointed three conservative justices. Twelve states have passed laws that would ban abortion entirely if Roe is overturned. \"Given the attacks on abortion in Texas and across the country, it's more important than ever that patients can access their choice of birth control and other health care through Title X,\" Planned Parenthood President Alexis McGill Johnson said in a statement. The new abortion referral policy for family planning clinics will take effect Nov. 8.",

Abortion-rights advocates are protesting in cities across the U.S. on Saturday, with their movement feeling deeply uneasy about what comes next after Texas enacted the nation's most restrictive abortion law, and with the conservative Supreme Court possibly ruling on the future of Roe v. Wade during its next term, which starts Monday. One of those advocates, Jess Hale, came to Washington, D.C., from Texas this week with other young activists to push for federal abortion protections, expressing frustration that activists' fears about abortion restrictions hadn't been taken seriously in the recent past. \"We have been saying since the beginning that it does matter, because now we're seeing the facts,\" Hale said. \"So it's like we've been trying to get people to pay attention to us, to listen to us, to get involved and to help us fight back.\" HK Gray is an advocate \u2014 and former client \u2014 of Jane's Due Process, which helps teenage girls in Texas navigate the abortion process. In addition to advocacy on Capitol Hill, she and her friends will also be marching in Saturday's Rally for Abortion Justice, which will culminate in front of the Supreme Court. \"I think just like the sheer amount of people that come really makes a statement in itself,\" she said. \"And it is a protest. I know everyone says, 'Oh, they don't really work,' but they bring the message across. Also, I brought my daughter to one, and I think it's a really nice experience to, if you have young children, to bring them there and have them be a part of it.\" Women's March, which organized annual protests during Donald Trump's presidency, is also helping stage Saturday's rallies. \"This is a coalition that is gathering under the hashtag 'Rally for Abortion Justice,' and Women's March is playing a particular role inside of that,\" said Executive Director Rachel Carmona. \"Obviously, we have, as you know, as the Taken movies would say, 'a specific set of skills,' and we can stand up a march of this size in four weeks.\" That makes Women's March one arm of a much bigger strategy for abortion-rights advocates as they figure out how to react to Texas' SB 8, a law that bans abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy, even while it's not totally clear to abortion-rights advocates what their best next steps are. \"We really thought we were going to get relief from the Supreme Court with this being so blatantly unconstitutional,\" said Marva Sadler, director of clinical services at Whole Woman's Health in McAllen, Texas. \"But what do we do next, and exactly what happens next? I don't know that any of us know that yet.\" For workers at abortion clinics, she said, one basic next step is informing patients of their options when they realize they can't get abortions in their home state. \"Most of those patients, they leave there not having a formulated plan of what's next,\" she said. \"But we try to make sure that they have the resources so that when they can kind of take that breath, they have everything they need to make that choice.\" Abortion-rights advocates in Texas have mobilized to inform patients of their options, as well as to provide funds to help people pay for the procedures. There are legal challenges to the law, and the city of Austin has agreed to \"investigate and pursue appropriate legal action in support of current efforts to challenge\" SB 8. In the medium and long term, the law may also energize Democrats in upcoming elections, including the 2022 midterms. But all that work can make stepping back and thinking about the bigger political picture tough. To Aimee Arrambide, executive director of the Texas abortion-rights organization Avow, the Texas law makes it clear that some on the left got complacent and even shy about fighting for abortion rights. \"I think that we've allowed abortion stigma to permeate all of progressive actions. People call it 'women's health care,' 'reproductive health care.' People won't use the word 'abortion,' \" she said. \"Abortion tends to be the rights that get negotiated away when progressives are fighting for issue areas.\" Carmona, from Women's March, agrees that progressives have not fought hard enough for abortion rights. However, she stresses that abortion-rights opponents are the main force that she and other abortion-rights groups are fighting. \"We also need to recognize these attacks for what they are,\" she said. \"This needs to be understood in the broader context of attacks on democracy and not just as a niche women's issue.\" In terms of policies, abortion-rights advocates are going on offense by pushing for new laws like the Women's Health Protection Act, which passed the U.S. House last week. However, such protections are unlikely to pass in a closely divided Senate. Meanwhile, abortion-rights advocates also acknowledge that defense against other anti-abortion-rights measures nationwide is a top priority. And eventually, those laws could proliferate much more, depending on how the Supreme Court rules in its next term on a Mississippi law banning abortion after 15 weeks. The court's term starts on Monday. Not coincidentally, the Supreme Court is where Saturday's march in D.C. will end, and it's where anti-abortion-rights activists hold their own prayer rally on Saturday.",

Democrats pair spending bill with raising the debt ceiling.  RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: President Biden is about to face a bunch of critics who complain that he has broken a promise. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: America is back. I speak today as President of the United States at the very start of my administration. And I'm sending a clear message to the world. America is back. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: That in February. And he said he was going to restore the alliances that kept the U.S. safe and cut back public clashes with allies, for which his predecessor was known. Months later, the United States is in the middle of more clashes with allies. And that is the context of his speech to the United Nations today. MARTIN: We've got NPR White House correspondent Ayesha Rascoe with us. Hi, Ayesha. AYESHA RASCOE, BYLINE: Good morning. MARTIN: A lot riding on this speech today. What can we expect from the president? RASCOE: Well, President Biden is going to make the case that the U.S. is closing the chapter on 20 years of war in Afghanistan and is now going to focus on diplomacy. He will talk about the need to work together to - in the pandemic around the world and to address climate change. But on COVID, there's a lot of concern from poorer countries about how far behind those countries are on getting vaccines. And there's been criticism of the booster shot plan for Americans that Biden has been pushing. MARTIN: I mean, he's kind of been getting it from all directions recently. There's, you know, the way that the U.S. withdrew from Afghanistan in particular. We got to mention France, which pulled its ambassador from Washington over this nuclear security deal that the U.S. made with Australia. Is any of that going to affect the way his message is going to be received? RASCOE: Well, so the White House acknowledges that there are some issues. But the White House says that because - that just because allies are questioning a decision, that doesn't mean they're questioning Biden's credibility. Here's how press secretary - White House press secretary Jen Psaki explained it yesterday. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JEN PSAKI: Reestablishing alliances doesn't mean that you won't have disagreements about how to approach any particular issue in the world. That is not the bar for having an alliance. RASCOE: Now, the thing about Biden is that he does have a really long history of backing the U.N. And people I've talked to said that that's likely going to earn Biden a certain amount of goodwill, especially after former President Donald Trump was so hostile to the U.N. So this moment gives Biden a chance to reset with allies and partners. But Alynna Lyon of the University of New New Hampshire told me that that's only going to go so far. ALYNNA LYON: Words are pretty hollow right now. And so there's going to need to be some action on the part of President Biden and the Biden administration. They can't just talk the talk. They actually have to walk the walk. MARTIN: All right. So what does the walk look like, Ayesha? RASCOE: The White House is saying that starting this week, Biden is going to have a big virtual summit tomorrow about the pandemic. And they've invited leaders and NGOs and the private sector to try to make commitments to boost vaccination rates around the world to help out poor countries. Then on Friday, he's invited members of the so-called Quad Coalition to the White House. That includes India, Japan, Australia and the U.S. And they're going to talk about vaccines and how to counter China. MARTIN: Before you go, do we know anything more about where things stand between the Biden administration and France's president, Emmanuel Macron? I mean, France was upset, to say the least, that they were sort of cut out of this deal to to sell nuclear submarines, to sell submarines to Australia. RASCOE: So Macron is not going to be at the U.N. in person. The White House says that Biden wants to talk to Macron on the phone to help smooth over these differences, but we don't know when that will happen. MARTIN: All right. Hasn't been scheduled yet. NPR White House correspondent Ayesha Rascoe, thank you. RASCOE: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MARTIN: We're going to go next to Texas, where a doctor is facing lawsuits for performing an abortion in defiance of a new law. INSKEEP: This is the law that bans most abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy. It's also the law with a creative enforcement provision. Ordinary citizens are invited to sue anybody who helps with an abortion. State officials are barred from enforcing the law, which made it impossible to go to court to stop them. The Supreme Court, you may recall, declined to block this law in advance. Now the case is going to court, though critics of abortion are not happy. MARTIN: NPR's Sarah McCammon is following this and joins us now. Hey, Sarah. SARAH MCCAMMON, BYLINE: Good morning. MARTIN: Just start off by telling us more about the doctor who's being sued. MCCAMMON: Yeah, his name is Dr. Alan Braid. He's an abortion provider from San Antonio. And over the weekend, he wrote an op-ed in The Washington Post in which he said he intentionally violated this law in an effort to provoke a legal challenge to it. He's now facing at least two lawsuits. And remember, as we said, SB 8 bans most abortions in Texas and lets anyone file lawsuits against abortion providers or anyone else believed to have been involved in illegal abortions. These penalties for violations start at $10,000, creating a lot of incentive for people to file lawsuits. And that is what is beginning to happen, at least in one of these cases. MARTIN: And so who's doing the suing. Who's behind the suit? MCCAMMON: Yeah, one comes from an Arkansas man named Oscar Stilley. And he describes himself in the filing as a disbarred and disgraced former lawyer who is currently in house arrest. He's serving a 15-year federal sentence for tax evasion and conspiracy charges. Still, he told The Washington Post he didn't file the lawsuit because of any strongly held beliefs about abortion but largely because he was hoping to collect the money. He's asking for as much as $100,000. The other suit was filed by a man from Chicago, Felipe Gomez, who describes himself as pro-choice. And he is using this complaint to ask the courts to invalidate the Texas law. MARTIN: But, Sarah, this is how the law was designed, right? I mean, it had this accountability mechanism. If a person breaks the law, they were going to be sued by ordinary civilians. So explain why anti-abortion groups aren't happy with this outcome. MCCAMMON: Right. They had hoped that the prospect of these penalties and litigation would stop Texas abortion providers from performing abortions beyond the limit in the law. Now, most providers in Texas say they are complying with the law but not Dr. Braid. And now he's facing these two lawsuits. But Texas Right to Life, which pushed hard for SB 8, isn't pleased. This isn't what they intended. In a statement, they say, quote, \"Both cases are self-serving legal stunts abusing the cause of action created in the Texas Heartbeat Act for their own purposes.\" MARTIN: But Doctor Braid, the doctor who defied this this law - you mentioned he did this intentionally. He knew it was coming. He must be trying to draw out these legal questions. Is this going to call into question the law itself and whether it's going to be allowed to stand? MCCAMMON: I talked to Mary Ziegler, a Florida State University law professor who focuses on reproductive rights. And she thinks so. She says anti-abortion groups who backed this law in Texas hoped it would prompt lawsuits from like-minded people. But now that it's taken effect, it's being used in a variety of other ways. MARY ZIEGLER: As a vehicle for getting rid of the law or just a vehicle for collecting money. And neither of those things, I think, are what Texas Right to Life had in mind. The problem, of course, is when you have a law where anyone can sue for any reason, there's no guarantee that they'll share the aims of Texas Right to Life. MCCAMMON: And there are several ongoing challenges to this law. This is just one more potential opportunity to test it in court. MARTIN: NPR's Sarah McCammon, thank you. MCCAMMON: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MARTIN: Keep the government running and stop the U.S. from defaulting on its debts. Congressional Democrats want to do both with the same bill. INSKEEP: Republicans object. They say Democrats are in charge in Washington and need to increase the debt limit on their own. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer says both parties ran up the debt, and both should own it. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CHUCK SCHUMER: What Republicans are doing is nothing short of a dine and dash of historic proportions. MARTIN: NPR congressional correspondent Kelsey Snell is with us this morning. I'll get the words out. Hi, Kelsey. KELSEY SNELL, BYLINE: Hi. Good morning. MARTIN: So conversations about the debt ceiling and spending limits can be complicated, so we are turning to you for clarity. Explain what is in the spending and debt limit bill that Democrats want to pass. SNELL: Here's what Democrats have told us. They want to lift the borrowing cap through the end of 2022. So that means allowing the country to keep making payments on debt from money that has already been spent. And conveniently, that end of 2022 date pushes the debt debate after the midterm elections. MARTIN: Ah. SNELL: Yes. And the federal funding portion of it will go through the end of December of this year. It also includes $14 billion for natural disasters from the past year and a half. But that doesn't include Hurricane Ida. They want to put an additional separate $10 billion alone for Ida relief. There's also about $6 billion for resettling refugees from Afghanistan. And this is - you know, it's meant to be a giant package of priorities. It's kind of an attempt to entice Republicans to vote for it or at least make them look bad if they vote no. It is, you know, a familiar standoff. We've heard this before. Spending and debt seem to keep coming up over and over and over again. MARTIN: Right. SNELL: But this time, we have less than 10 days to go before the fiscal year ends on September 30. And if they don't pass a government spending bill we have another government shutdown. MARTIN: Well, Senate Republicans have been saying for weeks that they wouldn't agree to a debt limit increase. And they haven't given an inch on that, have they? SNELL: No. And nothing has really changed here. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell put out a statement after Democrats announced all this saying that Democrats have decided to pass more than $3 trillion in new spending using budget rules to avoid Republican votes and avoid a fight with Republicans. And they should have to use the same tools to increase the debt limit. He says Republicans support extending current government funding and the money for the disaster relief and the Afghan assistance. They just don't support the debt limit part. The way he phrased it is - and this is a quote - \"Democrats want to build a partisan future.\" And he said, quote, \"Democrats are fully capable of owning this step themselves.\" MARTIN: I mean, he's right, isn't he? I mean, Democrats could just go it alone. SNELL: They could, but they'd have to go back and rewrite the instructions for budget reconciliation, that process that they're using for the spending bills. And they could include the debt limit there. But that also has risks. It assumes Democrats can pass the reconciliation bill, and that's far from assured right now. There are huge divisions within the party over the overall size of that spending portion of the bill - the details of the tax policy and the policy for renegotiating drug prices, just to name a few of the problems that they're facing. Plus, as Democrats say, Republicans helped spend this money. And Democrats want Republicans to, you know, have their fingerprints on passing the extension. MARTIN: But if it comes down to keeping the government open or going it alone, I mean, it's kind of an obvious choice for Democrats, right? SNELL: We really don't know how this is going to resolve. And, you know, the last major debt limit standoff in 2011 got resolved, but it led to a downgrade in the country's credit worthiness. MARTIN: NPR congressional correspondent Kelsey Snell.

            "article_content": "Canadians go to the polls tomorrow for a snap election called by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. He is gambling his handling of the pandemic will win his Liberal Party more seats in parliament.  MICHEL MARTIN, HOST: Tomorrow is Election Day in Canada. Voters will determine whether Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his Liberal Party get to hang on to power. Trudeau himself called the snap election in August in the hope of winning back a larger margin of control in Canada's parliament, but polls have shown a tight race in the final days of the campaign. Reporter Emma Jacobs has more from Montreal. EMMA JACOBS, BYLINE: When Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called an early election last month, he said Canadian voters deserved a chance to weigh in on big decisions the government will make as Canada emerges from the pandemic. He even evoked the end of World War II. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRIME MINISTER JUSTIN TRUDEAU: This is a moment where we're going to be taking decisions that will last not just for the coming months, but for the coming decades. And Canadians deserve their say. JACOBS: Trudeau seemed to believe Liberals could regain majority control of parliament based on his handling of the pandemic and the generous spending programs his government introduced. But early in this short campaign, the polls made that look like a risky bet. Andrew McDougall is an assistant professor of Canadian politics at the University of Toronto. ANDREW MCDOUGALL: For a time, it looked as though - and this is still a possibility at this point - that he may actually lose the election. JACOBS: Trudeau, who currently leads a minority government with a plurality of seats in parliament, could end up with fewer seats than his party's main political rivals, the Conservatives, and lose his job as prime minister. MCDOUGALL: Now, his polls have recovered quite a bit. And it looks like now he's back on track to at least get back into power. But, you know, the fact that it came so close shows that this was not a calculation that paid off the way that he wanted it to. JACOBS: A new conservative leader, Erin O'Toole, has staked out his position as a centrist, explains Ihor Korbabicz of Abacus Data, a Canadian polling and research firm. IHOR KORBABICZ: The Conservatives this time around have put forward a very moderate platform for Canadians to consider compared to the Canadian - typical conservative Canadian traditions. JACOBS: He's to the left of some current party members on issues like abortion and climate policy, leading a debate moderator, Shachi Kurl, to ask if O'Toole or his party caucus would actually make conservative policy. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) SHACHI KURL: So is it you, sir, or your caucus that's driving the bus? ERIN O'TOOLE: I am driving the bus to make sure we get this country back on track. JACOBS: Trudeau's campaign bus has been pursued and his events disrupted by anti-vaccine and anti-lockdown protesters. Many appear to support a far-right party that has grown its support in recent months. The People's Party of Canada currently holds no seats in parliament. Again, professor Andrew McDougall. MCDOUGALL: What they seem to have done is link the resentment that many people feel about lockdowns, vaccine mandates, mask mandates and connect it to its very hard-right platform. And this is giving it a lift that it's never really seen before. JACOBS: He says political observers will be watching to see whether their supporters turn out to vote and whether their strength will impact conservative candidates in tight races. Between mail-in and early voting, more than 6 million people have already cast ballots in Canada's first national election of the pandemic. Counting the higher than normal number of mail-in ballots won't start until the day after the election, so close races may not be called on election night. For NPR News, I'm Emma Jacobs in Montreal.

DALLAS \u2014 Texas Gov. Greg Abbott on Tuesday defended a new state law banning most abortions that also does not provide exceptions for cases of rape or incest, saying it does not force victims to give birth even though it prohibits abortions before some women know they're pregnant. Abbott, a Republican, added that Texas would strive to \"eliminate all rapists from the streets\" while taking questions during his first press conference since the law took effect last week. The comments drew new criticism from opponents of the Texas law that is the biggest curb on abortion in the U.S. since they were legalized a half-century ago, prohibiting abortions once medical professionals can detect cardiac activity, which is usually around six weeks. Though abortion providers in Texas say the law is unconstitutional, they say they are abiding by it. \"His comments are confusing to me because they certainly do not seem to reflect the realities of this law,\" said Amy Jones, the chief executive officer of the Dallas Area Rape Crisis Center. Recent surveys by the U.S. Department of Justice found that most rapes go unreported to police, including a 2019 survey that found about 1 in 3 victims reporting they were raped or sexually assaulted. Abbott signed the measure into law in May. Although other GOP-led states have passed similar measures, they have been blocked by courts. Texas' version differs significantly because it solely leaves enforcement to private citizens who can sue abortion providers who violate the law. Abbott was asked about the new abortion restrictions while signing into law an overhaul of Texas' election rules. \"Texas will work tirelessly to make sure that we eliminate all rapists from the streets of Texas by aggressively going out and arresting them and prosecuting them,\" Abbott said. Jones said Abbott's statements were both confusing and disheartening. She said she'd \"like to hear more\" from Abbott on his statement on eliminating rape. \"Certainly it is in our mission statement to work to end sexual violence, that is why we exist, but we are also very aware that that is an aspirational goal that yes, we do believe that this is a preventable crime, but it if it were that easy, rape would no longer exist,\" Jones said. The Justice Department has said it will not tolerate violence against anyone who is trying to obtain an abortion in Texas as federal officials explore options to challenge the law.",

            "article_content": "NPR's Ari Shapiro speaks with women's rights attorney Kathryn Kolbert on longstanding efforts to chip away at Roe v. Wade and the strategies abortion rights supporters could use to fight such laws.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: The law that bans nearly all abortions in Texas was designed to be difficult to challenge. It puts private citizens in charge of enforcement rather than state officials. And in the day since the Supreme Court let that law stand, Republican lawmakers in at least four other states have said they hope to use the Texas legislation as a template to restrict abortion in their own states. Those who support abortion rights are scrambling for a counterstrategy. Kathryn Kolbert is a women's rights attorney and co-author of \"Controlling Women: What We Must Do Now To Save Reproductive Freedom.\" Welcome. KATHRYN KOLBERT: Thanks, Ari. SHAPIRO: You argued the Supreme Court case Planned Parenthood vs. Casey in the early '90s. That's the case that upheld the basic tenets of Roe vs. Wade. Now 20 years later, the Supreme Court is far more conservative than it has been at any time since Roe. So how does that shape your strategy? KOLBERT: Well, Ari, I often say that arguing before the Supreme Court is a lot like \"Sesame Street.\" You have to learn to count. And the only number that actually matters is five. SHAPIRO: Because five justices gets you to a majority. KOLBERT: That's correct. And in 1992, when I argued the Casey case, we thought there were five justices at that time to overturn Roe. That didn't happen. Today we're not so lucky. There's at least five, if not six, votes that could overturn Roe. And the latest vote count in Texas shows us that there are at least five votes there that are hell-bent on destroying the rights that are guaranteed in both Roe and Casey. SHAPIRO: And so that being the case, do you just try to avoid the Supreme Court altogether, or do you see any scenario where the Texas law could be overturned, even by this very conservative court? KOLBERT: I see very little opportunity to have that happen. SHAPIRO: So what do you do? KOLBERT: Well, when we wrote the book, our biggest advice was to not rely upon the courts. The federal courts in particular are not our friends. And we need to turn instead to the legislative process to restore the rights that will be taken away probably in the Mississippi case that will be heard sometime this fall. SHAPIRO: You say abortion rights supporters need to turn to the legislative process. But abortion rights supporters have lost ground in state legislatures, which is what led to laws like the one in Texas and the one in Mississippi. It seems like if that's your strategy, things are going in the opposite direction of where you would like to see them go. KOLBERT: Exactly. The anti-abortion movement had a 40-year strategy. We need to have a long-term one as well. SHAPIRO: So if you're saying that the Supreme Court and federal courts are not friendly to abortion rights and many state legislatures are not friendly to abortion rights, is the only strategy here a 40-year one? Is there anything more immediate to challenge these very restrictive laws? KOLBERT: There's absolutely shorter-term strategies. In the - what I call the purple states, we've got to work to make them blue. The first thing you got to do is to make the governor blue and then work on changing the composition of the legislature and do the hard work of winning elections because that's what our foes have done, and they are now reaping the benefits of that. SHAPIRO: In the immediate term, abortion rights supporters in Texas, Mississippi and other states have called this an emergency. What advice do you have for people in states like Texas who need to end a pregnancy now and do not have the resources to leave the state? KOLBERT: The good news is, unlike the days before abortion was legal, when women were forced to seek surgical abortions from illicit and often shady practitioners, today the availability of medical abortion can greatly improve women's health in a circumstance where the procedure is illegal. SHAPIRO: Do you mean, like, abortion induced through a pill? Is that what you're referring to? KOLBERT: That's right. And self-medicated because women will have to do that under the Texas law on their own. And the most important thing is for the rest of us, those who aren't facing an unintended pregnancy right now, we need to get up off the couch and get active and make sure that no longer can bills like this be passed without some vocal opposition. SHAPIRO: That's Kathryn Kolbert, co-founder of the Center for Reproductive Rights. Thank you for speaking with us. KOLBERT: Thanks, Ari. Copyright \u00a9 2021 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "American Catholic bishops voted to move forward with a process that may challenge the eligibility of politicians who support abortion rights, such as President Joe Biden, to receive communion.  AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: One of the most intimate moments of Catholic worship is communion. The election of Joe Biden, only the second practicing Catholic president in U.S. history, has revived the controversy over whether politicians who support abortion rights should be permitted to take part in that sacred right. Today, after much debate at their annual gathering, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops moved one step closer to saying no, and they've pledged to draft a statement to that effect. Joining us to walk through the background of this controversial vote, Reverend James Martin, a Jesuit priest and editor-at-large of America magazine. Welcome back to the program. JAMES MARTIN: Thank you. CORNISH: Give us a sense of the arguments that led to this vote. MARTIN: Well, the arguments are pretty straightforward, which is if you don't adhere to Catholic teaching, you are not in communion with the church, and so therefore, since President Biden, you know, supports abortion, he shouldn't receive communion. But, you know, on the other side is the argument that there are many issues beyond just abortion, you know, that would put someone outside of communion with the church. And so I think the focus, which is clearly on abortion, is really disturbing to a lot of people. CORNISH: There were reports that the head of the Vatican's doctrine-making arm warned that creating a policy like this on Catholic politicians could be divisive. What more do we know about what the Vatican thinks of this? MARTIN: Well, the letter was released. And so Cardinal Ladaria, who is the prefect, said that, you know, as you were saying, that it could lead to disunity not only in the bishops conference, but among the faithful. And other bishops - for example, Bishop Robert McElroy in San Diego - you know, warned against the weaponization of the Eucharist. And it really - it's the most sacred moment. And unfortunately, some of the bishops, you know, mentioned President Biden and Speaker Pelosi. And, you know, it was very hard for people not to see that this is at least motivated by some political considerations, which is really disturbing for a lot of Catholics. CORNISH: Has the pope spoken about any of this? MARTIN: The pope was very clear in many times. He has a document called \"Evangelii Gaudium\" where he says the Eucharist is not a prize for the perfect. It is nourishment, you know, for the sick and for those who need it. And he - I think about a week ago, he even talked about the Eucharist not being, you know, for the perfect. You know, every Catholic before he or she goes to communion says, Lord, I am not worthy to receive you. No one is worthy. And again, to focus on one particular or even a few issues really seems, to people, out of whack with what is supposed to be the sacrament of unity. CORNISH: The Pew Research Center finds that 67% of American Catholics say that Joe Biden should be allowed to receive communion during mass. So who are the bishops representing? MARTIN: Well, that's a good point. The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, in a sense, has no real authority over the local bishops. So, for example, President Biden is in the archdiocese of Washington. That would be Cardinal Gregory. And Cardinal Gregory has already said he is not going to deny him communion. That's a paraphrase. So the bishop's conference, you know, is a kind of moral authority. But in the end, you know, it's only the pope that can tell Cardinal Gregory or whatever local bishop there is that so-and-so couldn't receive or shouldn't receive communion. CORNISH: So what do you think the point is? MARTIN: Well, the point for, I think, a lot of the bishops is to say that, you know, these are Catholic teachings, and we need to be clear about what Catholic teachings are and what it means to be in communion. But again - you know, and Pope Francis has said this. You know, there are other issues. I mean, for example, will they deny communion to someone who supports the death penalty - I mean, no one has talked about that - or politicians who don't help the poor? There's another document where Pope Francis says equally sacred are other lives, you know, the lives of the poor, those already born, as Pope Francis said. And so they're - you know, I think - you know, I'm pro-life, but pro-life means more than just abortion. CORNISH: That's Reverend James Martin, Jesuit priest and editor-at-large for America magazine. Thank you for sharing with us. MARTIN: You're welcome. Copyright \u00a9 2021 NPR.  All rights reserved.  Visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.

After a contentious debate, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops has voted to move forward with a process that could call into question the eligibility of politicians like President Joe Biden to receive Communion. The bishops voted 168-55 in favor of drafting \"a formal statement on the meaning of the Eucharist in the life of the Church,\" officials announced on Friday afternoon, the final day of their three-day virtual meeting. Six bishops abstained. Biden's election as only the nation's second Roman Catholic president has prompted renewed debate over denying Communion to Catholic politicians who support abortion rights, a position at odds with church teachings. During their online meeting, bishops held a spirited discussion Thursday before voting on the proposal to direct the bishops' Committee on Doctrine to draft the statement. Such a document, once completed, could include guidelines for denying Communion to public officials. Biden was mentioned by name or alluded to several times, including by Bishop Liam Cary of the Diocese of Baker in Oregon, who described what he sees as an \"unprecedented situation in the country.\" \"We've never had a situation like this where the executive is a Catholic president opposed to the teaching of the church \" Cary said. Archbishop Joseph Naumann of Kansas City, who leads the bishops'  Committee on Pro-Life Activities, has been among the most vocal critics of Biden's support abortion rights. He said he's disturbed by Catholic officials who \"flaunt their Catholicity\" while publicly taking positions on abortion that conflict with those of the church. Archbishop Joseph Naumann, of Kansas City, presents a report on stem-cell research during the general meeting of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops in Orlando, Fla., Thursday, June 12, 2008.\n                \n                    \n                    Phelan M. Ebenhack/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption \"This is a Catholic president that's doing the most aggressive thing we've ever seen in terms of this attack on life when it's most innocent,\" Naumann said. Other bishops urged caution, echoing a warning from the Vatican that moving forward with the document could politicize the sacrament of Holy Communion and risk deepening divisions among American Catholics, at a time when many are just beginning to return to in-person worship. \"Bishops now want to talk about excluding people at a time when the real challenge before them is welcoming people back to the regular practice of the faith, and rebuilding their communities,\" Cardinal Blase Cupich of Chicago warned. Bishop Robert Coerver of Lubbock, Texas, described what he saw as a rush to address the issue, and suggested that the debate was being clouded by concerns about upcoming elections. \"I can't help but wonder if the years 2022 and 2024 might be part of the rush,\" he said. \"And I think we need to be real careful not to get embroiled in the political situation.\" Soon after, Bishop Thomas Daly of the Spokane Diocese expressed skepticism about calls by some bishops for more time to discuss the matter and engage in dialogue with officials who support abortion rights. \"There is an aggressiveness in a number of elected officials, and this call for dialogue,\" he said \"Sometimes I wonder if the dialogue is meant not truly to listen but to delay.\" The bishops' vote concerns what is largely a procedural step \u2013 but one fraught with debate, given larger disagreements over how church leaders treat public officials who take positions at odds with those of the Catholic Church. Those decisions currently are left to local bishops. About two-thirds of American Catholics believe Biden should be allowed to receive Communion, according to a survey by the Pew Research Center released in March. But many Catholics \u2013 like Americans in general \u2013 are starkly divided on the issue by party; more than half of Catholics who also identify as Republicans said Biden should not be allowed to receive the sacrament because of his views on abortion. The issue of who is eligible to receive the sacrament also has divided U.S. Catholic Bishops; several have called for denying Communion to Biden and other prominent Roman Catholic officials who take positions on abortion at odds with those of the Catholic Church, while others have argued the Eucharist should not be used to advance political goals. Church leaders have expressed concerns about declining Mass attendance, and how well parishioners understand the full meaning and significance of the sacrament. In 2019, only about one third of American Catholics surveyed by Pew said they believed the church's teaching known as \"transubstantiation\" \u2013 or the idea that during Communion, the bread and wine become the body and blood of Jesus Christ. Instead, most Catholics said they saw the sacrament as symbolic. According to church teaching, Catholics are expected to be free of any significant, unconfessed sin and in what's known as a \"state of grace\" when receiving Communion. Similar discussions have arisen before, most notably when Democrat John Kerry, also a Roman Catholic, was running for President in 2004. The debate resurfaced surrounding Biden's run for President in 2020. Biden, only the nation's second Catholic president, was endorsed by Planned Parenthood and other abortion rights groups during his presidential run in 2020. The year before, he pleased abortion rights advocates by ending his longtime support for the Hyde Amendment, which prohibits federal funds from being used to pay for abortions for low-income women, in most cases. The three-day meeting, which is being held virtually due to the coronavirus pandemic, ended on Friday afternoon. Preparation of a new statement on the meaning of the Eucharist is only a first step; the bishops would have an opportunity to amend the proposed document at a future meeting before voting on whether or not to approve it.  They're scheduled to meet again in person in November.",

Terry McAuliffe, seen here on May 29, has won the Democratic primary in a bid to regain his old job. Former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe is one step closer to winning his old post after defeating four other Democrats in a primary on Tuesday. The Associated Press called the race for him shortly after polls closed in Virginia. McAuliffe's decisive win over a diverse field sets up a closely watched general election contest with Republican businessman Glenn Youngkin, who has been endorsed by former President Donald Trump. McAuliffe's primary competition included state Sen. Jennifer McClellan and former state Del. Jennifer Carroll Foy, both of whom were aiming to become the first Black woman elected governor in the United States. Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax and state Del. Lee Carter were also in the race. Virginia's off-year elections are often seen as a bellwether for the national mood. In nine of the state's last 10 gubernatorial races, the party in the White House has lost the contest in Virginia. McAuliffe bucked that trend when he narrowly won his first term in 2013. The former entrepreneur and chair of the Democratic National Committee spent much of his term battling a Republican-led legislature on hot-button issues like abortion and gun rights. He also made economic development a priority, aggressively courting Amazon in a successful push to bring their second headquarters to Northern Virginia (the current governor, Ralph Northam, ultimately inked the deal). McAuliffe mulled a run for the White House after his term ended in 2018 but ruled it out after now-President Biden, whom he's called a friend, entered the primary. If he wins in November, McAuliffe will be just the second two-term governor in Virginia since the end of the Civil War. Virginia's constitution forbids consecutive runs and McAuliffe has been endorsed by Northam, who is expected to retire from political life after his term ends. McAuliffe and Youngkin, a former CEO of the Carlyle Group, have some things in common: Both men are wealthy, well-connected residents of the Washington, D.C., suburbs. McAuliffe is a prolific fundraiser who counts U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and former President Bill Clinton as allies, while Youngkin has already plowed more than $12 million of his own money into his campaign. With McAuliffe easily leading in Democratic primary polls and fundraising, the pair began mud-slinging right after Youngkin won a GOP nominating convention in May. Youngkin has cast McAuliffe as a \"career politician\" who had failed to solve the problems of Virginians. And immediately after McAuliffe's win, the Youngkin campaign launched two ads attacking McAuliffe, including one featuring clips from Carroll Foy, a primary opponent endorsed by some progressive groups, saying McAuliffe \"failed the people of Virginia.\" (Carroll Foy said on Monday she would support the eventual Democratic nominee even if she lost.) McAuliffe has repeatedly criticized Youngkin's embrace of Trump and argued he would bring radical views on issues like abortion and LGBTQ protections that would imperil people's wellbeing and the state economy. \"We cannot bring the bio, the life sciences, the renewable energy jobs to a state that discriminates,\" McAuliffe said at a campaign stop in Richmond on Monday. Republicans haven't won a statewide election in Virginia since 2009, when Bob McDonnell was elected governor. Tucker Martin, McDonnell's former communications director, said the GOP faces an \"absolutely formidable\" opponent in McAuliffe, who could leverage his experience and connections in his campaign. Still, Martin, who also advised Ed Gillespie in his unsuccessful 2017 run against Northam, predicted Trump would not play as large a role this year as he did in that race, \"when he essentially blocked out the sun.\" That could create a more favorable environment for Republicans, Martin said, given Trump's unpopularity in a state he lost by 10% in 2020. Democrats, on the other hand, have to create a sense of urgency without Trump looming across the Potomac. \"When you win this much, it's hard to keep that energy and intensity up,\" Martin said. Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia's Center for Politics, said Trump's shadow still loomed over the race given the continued news coverage he generates. \"Yes, Youngkin projects a good image,\" Sabato said. \"But it's easily dented, maybe even destroyed, because he has a big 'R' next to his name and he is very definitely tied to Donald Trump.\"",

LIMA, Peru (AP) \u2014 A rural teacher-turned-political novice and the daughter of an imprisoned former president on Monday traded the lead in a close race for Peru's presidency in a runoff election as the coronavirus pandemic continues to batter the Andean country. With 94% of ballots tallied, leftist Pedro Castillo had 50.07% of the vote, while conservative Keiko Fujimori had 49.92%, according to official results. This is Fujimori's third run for president, a role her father held in the 1990s. The figures released by Peru's elections agency, the National Office of Electoral Processes, included almost all votes cast near the country's electoral processing centers. The agency was still waiting for the arrival of votes from remote rural areas and abroad. \"No one can say for sure at this point who is going to win,\" Fernando Tuesta, a political scientist at the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru and former Peruvian elections chief, told a local radio station. In 2016, now-former President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski defeated Fujimori by just 42,597 votes. Fujimori's support was expected to come from voters in the capital of Lima and other urban areas, while Castillo's sympathizers are in rural communities. Neither candidate had made any statements Monday. Castillo left the rural, Andean district of Tacabamba early to travel to Lima. The polarizing populist candidates have promised coronavirus vaccines for all and other strategies to alleviate the health emergency that has killed more than 180,000 people in Peru and pushed millions into poverty. The election followed a statistical revision from Peru's government that more than doubled the COVID-19 death toll previously acknowledged by officials. Voters across Peru, where voting is mandatory, headed to the polls throughout Sunday under a set schedule meant to minimize long lines. No disturbances were reported at voting sites, which even opened in San Miguel del Ene, a remote village in a cocaine-producing area where two weeks ago a massacre ended with 16 people dead. Pre-election polls indicated the candidates were virtually tied heading into the runoff. In the first round of voting, featuring 18 candidates, neither received more than 20% support and both were strongly opposed by sectors of Peruvian society. \"The candidate who becomes (president), either Keiko or Pedro, the people, the only thing we have to do is accept it, but they better govern well,\" said Lucia Carrion, a street vendor in Lima. \"There is so much corruption. One of them has to stop so much corruption that there is here in Peru.\" The pandemic not only has strained Peru's medical and cemetery infrastructure, left millions unemployed and highlighted longstanding inequalities in the country. It has also deepened people's mistrust of government as it mismanaged the COVID-19 response and a secret vaccination drive for the well-connected erupted into a national scandal. Amid protests and corruption allegations, the South American country cycled through three presidents in November. Some analysts warn this election could be another tipping point for people's simmering frustrations and bring more political instability. President Francisco Sagasti after voting said the candidates should respect the results and ask their followers to refrain from staging protests over the outcome. Fujimori asked her followers to be prudent because \"the margin is so small,\" while Castillo demanded a review of all ballots to \"guarantee the true popular will of the Peruvian people.\" Fujimori, a former congresswoman, has promised various bonuses to people, including a $2,500 one-time payment to each family with at least one COVID-19 victim. She has also proposed distributing 40% of a tax for the extraction of minerals, oil or gas among families who live near those areas. Keiko Fujimori herself has been imprisoned as part of a graft investigation though she was later released. Her father, Alberto Fujimori, governed between 1990 and 2000 and is serving a 25-year sentence for corruption and the killings of 25 people. She has promised to free him should she win. Castillo until recently was a rural schoolteacher in the country's third-poorest district, deep in the Andes. The son of illiterate peasants entered politics by leading a teachers' strike. While his stance on nationalizing key sectors of the economy has softened, he remains committed to rewriting the constitution that was approved under the regime of Fujimori's father. Both candidates oppose abortion and same-sex marriage. Peru is the second largest copper exporter in the world and mining accounts for almost 10% of its GDP and 60% of its exports, so Castillo's initial proposal to nationalize the nation's mining industry set off alarm bells among business leaders. But regardless of who gets picked to succeed Sagasti on July 28, investors will remain skittish.",

The first-time political candidate is the Republican nominee for governor in Virginia. Virginia Republicans have chosen businessman and first-time political candidate Glenn Youngkin to be their nominee for governor. \"I am prepared to lead, excited to serve and profoundly humbled by the trust the people have placed in me,\" Youngkin said in a statement late Monday, after his victory was secured. \"Virginians have made it clear that they are ready for a political outsider with proven business experience to bring real change in Richmond.\" Youngkin, who has already poured more than $5.5 million of his personal funds into his campaign, emerged from a bruising nomination fight with six other candidates that concluded with a multi-location party convention. Tech entrepreneur Pete Snyder took second place in the ranked-choice runoff, conceding Monday evening. Controversial state Sen. Amanda Chase came in third. The GOP candidates competed in a party-run convention held at 39 sites across the commonwealth on Saturday. The party spent over 12 hours Monday hand-counting roughly 30,000 ballots. The 54-year-old Youngkin pitched himself as a pro-life and pro-gun Christian who is best-positioned to take on Democrats in the vote-rich suburbs of Washington, D.C., Richmond and Hampton Roads. Republicans haven't won a statewide election in Virginia since 2009. Youngkin is a former CEO of Carlyle Group, an investment firm, and vowed to use his wealth to influence local as well as statewide conservatives. \"If we don't push back against the money that's coming from [liberal financier] George Soros and others, we will never win these most important local seats,\" Youngkin told a crowd of Republicans at an event outside Richmond last month. \"It will not be a lonely victory for me in November.\" Much of Youngkin's spending so far has gone into TV ads, including one featuring former President Donald Trump. Several former Trump staffers worked on Youngkin's campaign. Youngkin's first policy proposal  \u2014 an \"Election Integrity Task Force\" \u2014 took a cue from the former president's rhetoric. Youngkin argued that voters from both sides of the aisle distrust elections, pointing to voters who challenged the 2016 and 2020 presidential counts. Youngkin stumped alongside U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who led the effort in the Senate to object to the certification of President Biden's victory. Pressed on whether he personally believed false claims of widespread voter fraud, Youngkin hedged. \"Our president is Joe Biden because he was inaugurated as such,\" he said. \"And so what we have to do is look forward at what we have to fix.\" Youngkin has called for a tightening of Virginia's voting laws, which were expanded when Democrats took control of the state legislature in 2020. His proposals include photo IDs for all ballots, an application to prove citizenship before casting mail-in ballots and two witness signatures for mail-in ballots. Along with other GOP candidates, Youngkin railed against school closures amid the pandemic and vowed to defend law enforcement. He got blowback from some conservatives for not answering questionnaires sent by the National Rifle Association and the Virginia Citizens Defense League \u2014 a move some activists argued would precipitate a pivot on the issue in the general election. Rich Anderson, chair of the state GOP, said the party would unite beyond its statewide candidates despite a campaign that was heavy on attack ads. \"That's not just the party chairman with happy talk,\" Anderson said in an interview Monday. \"This is a pendulum business. A party can stay in power for only so long.\" Youngkin will face the winner of a June 8 state-run Democratic primary. Former Gov. Terry McAuliffe holds a large lead over four other candidates in recent polls. Susan Swecker, chair of the Democratic Party of Virginia, painted Youngkin as a \"far-right extremist who has demonstrated total allegiance to Donald Trump.\" \"Throughout this campaign, Youngkin has advanced Trump's dangerous election conspiracy theories, opposed critical COVID-19 relief for working families and small businesses, and threatened to gut Virginians' health care,\" she said in a statement.",

Troy Carter won Louisiana's 2nd Congressional District seat which was vacated by Cedric Richmond after he left to be part of President Biden's administration. BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) \u2014 Democrat Troy Carter won Saturday's special election for Louisiana's vacant U.S. House seat, defeating his state Senate colleague and ending an acrimonious, intraparty clash. Carter easily defeated Karen Carter Peterson in the race for Louisiana's only Democrat-held seat in Congress, handing a victory to the more moderate side of the party after Peterson planted herself firmly in the progressive camp. The pair of state senators had only modest policy differences to distinguish them, and the race centered mainly on personality. Carter had the backing, however, of the seat's predecessor, Cedric Richmond. The 2nd District seat \u2014 representing a majority-Black district centered in New Orleans and extending up the Mississippi River into Baton Rouge \u2014 was open because Richmond left the position shortly after he won last year's election to work as a special adviser to President Joe Biden. Richmond endorsed Carter, a former New Orleans City Council member, in the race. Peterson, the former chair of Louisiana's Democratic Party, would have been the state's first Black woman elected to Congress if she had been elected. Carter and Peterson reached Saturday's runoff after they emerged as the top vote-getters among 15 candidates in the March primary. Carter raised more campaign cash in the competition. The two state senators differed more in style than substance, though Peterson positioned herself as the more liberal candidate. In one runoff debate, Peterson described herself as \"bold and progressive\" and willing to \"shake things up to get things done.\" Carter is known more for his ability and willingness to work across party lines, while Peterson is more overtly partisan in her approach. She suggested Carter cozied up to Republicans to boost his campaign, while he said Peterson's dogmatic approach damaged her ability to pass legislation. \"In order to get things done, they need to send someone to Washington who can build bridges, not walls, that can establish relationships that mean something, not kick rocks because you don't get your way, not spew lies because you're losing,\" Carter said in a debate. \"Listen, I've demonstrated a willingness to work with people.\" Both candidates backed an increase in the minimum wage, the legalization of recreational marijuana and abortion rights. They supported changes in how police agencies and public safety are funded and approached, though Peterson went further saying she backed a \"complete restructuring.\" \"This system wasn't built to protect Black and brown people,\" she said. \"We can't just reform the police. We need to reimagine public safety.\" Both Carter and Peterson said they support the idea of \"Medicare for All.\" But while Peterson fully embraced shifting to a government-run, single-payer plan, Carter said he'd like people to have the option of retaining employer-financed coverage. Across the campaign, they traded accusations. Carter hit Peterson on her many missed votes in the Louisiana Senate. Peterson slammed campaign donations Carter received from people and entities tied to the oil and gas industry. She made support of \"environmental justice\" for poor communities facing greater health risks from pollution one of the cornerstones of her campaign. Carter hammered Peterson for suggesting she helped establish Louisiana's Medicaid expansion program, which was started by Gov. John Bel Edwards and required no legislation. He noted that when she was head of the Democratic Party, she discouraged Edwards from running for governor. They each touted high-profile endorsements. Peterson had backing from voting rights advocate Stacey Abrams, progressive U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell, among others. In addition to Richmond's endorsement, Carter had backing from No. 3 House Democratic leader James Clyburn of South Carolina, New Orleans District Attorney Jason Williams and every Black member of the state Senate besides Peterson.",

ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: Republicans picked up seats in statehouses across the country in November. And now, they are using those gains to push new abortion restrictions, some of which resemble laws previously blocked by the courts. NPR's Sarah McCammon reports. SARAH MCCAMMON, BYLINE: In the last couple of years, federal courts have repeatedly struck down early abortion bans in Ohio, Georgia, Alabama and elsewhere. But this year, Republican lawmakers in South Carolina were undeterred. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE) KATRINA SHEALY: This bill protects the life of the unborn with a heartbeat. LARRY GROOMS: This is a sensitive issue. This is a controversial issue. But it shouldn't be. But it is. MCCAMMON: Those voices were South Carolina Republican Senators Katrina Shealy and Larry Grooms during debate over a bill prohibiting most abortions after cardiac activity can be detected. That's often about six weeks into a pregnancy. Republicans were able to pass the bill after picking up several seats in the November election. Almost as soon as Republican Governor Henry McMaster signed the law, a federal judge blocked it. A court hearing is scheduled for Monday. Bonyen Lee-Gilmore is Planned Parenthood state media director. She says Republican gains in several state legislatures have set up a renewed battle over abortion rights. BONYEN LEE-GILMORE: It is a very odd time where there is so much hope and opportunity with the Biden administration, pro-reproductive health majorities in Congress, yet incredibly extreme, hostile anti-reproductive health care majorities in state legislatures. MCCAMMON: A new analysis from the Guttmacher Institute, which supports abortion rights, reports an unusually busy year for anti-abortion legislation, with more than 300 proposed restrictions. Katie Glenn, with the anti-abortion rights group Americans United For Life, points to Republican gains in New Hampshire and Montana, where lawmakers have proposed restrictions on procedures performed later in pregnancy. KATIE GLENN: You know, we've seen some really positive trends. MCCAMMON: Glenn also says there are new efforts to restrict medication abortion, particularly via telehealth, which has become more popular during the pandemic. Ohio recently banned the use of telehealth for abortion. And Glenn says some states are considering new rules for doctors prescribing abortion pills. GLENN: They can give the woman the information she needs so that she's making a fully informed decision and she understands that this is a multiday process at her home. MCCAMMON: In Arkansas, lawmakers have approved a new requirement that patients call a counseling hotline before an abortion. At least two other states - Texas and Tennessee - are considering similar proposals. Tennessee lawmakers also have proposed an unusual bill that would give a man who impregnates a woman the ability to stop her from having an abortion. Mary Ziegler, a law professor at Florida State University, says the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett appears to be triggering an onslaught of deeply restrictive abortion bills, including ones that courts already have said are unconstitutional under the landmark Roe v. Wade decision. MARY ZIEGLER: I think now, some red state lawmakers are looking at this and thinking, well, surely, you know, there will be five votes to overturn Roe among those six conservatives. MCCAMMON: Meanwhile, some states are pushing in the other direction, working to guarantee abortion rights. New Mexico recently repealed decades-old restrictions that were still on the books, anticipating that the federal courts may chip away at those rights in the years to come.

            "article_content": "President Biden is only the second observant Catholic president in U.S. history. He also supports the right to an abortion, which has set him off on a rocky start with U.S. bishops.  AILSA CHANG, HOST: Opponents of abortion held their annual March for Life today. This year, due to COVID-19, it was almost an entirely online event. And the march this year, unlike last year, got no backing from the White House. President Biden supports a right to abortion. That position puts him at odds with his own Catholic Church. The opening prayer at this year's march was offered by the chair of the U.S. Bishops' Pro-Life Committee, Kansas City Archbishop Joseph Naumann. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JOSEPH NAUMANN: We seek your blessings on the vast, diverse and energetic pro-life movement in our nation. CHANG: As today's march suggested, Biden has begun his term in a difficult position with U.S. Catholic leaders. Here's NPR's Tom Gjelten. TOM GJELTEN, BYLINE: It's hard to question Joe Biden's attachment to his Catholicism. He's attended Mass regularly all his life. He turned to his priest to help him cope with grief. On the morning of his inauguration, he went to church. CAROL KEEHAN: The man so clearly loves his faith. GJELTEN: Sister Carol Keehan worked closely with Biden for years as the head of the Catholic Health Association. KEEHAN: You can't know Joe Biden and not know that he loves his faith and that he takes his faith seriously. GJELTEN: As is seen, Sister Keehan says, in the way a Biden presidency will reflect Catholic values. KEEHAN: The things that he talks about - dignity, respect, helping the people that have been hurt the most - those are things that resonate with the gospel, resonate with our faith and the faith of many other people. GJELTEN: These days, it matters what kind of Catholic one is. Biden is hard to pigeonhole. He may not espouse the church positions on abortion or same-sex marriage, but neither does he challenge them. Catholic historian Massimo Faggioli. MASSIMO FAGGIOLI: Biden has never said, I disagree with the teaching of the church. He has simply said, as a politician, I cannot impose the teaching of my church on the whole population. GJELTEN: Faggioli is the author of a new book, \"Joe Biden And Catholicism In The United States.\" He thinks Biden exemplifies an old-fashioned Catholicism, characterized neither by loyalty to church doctrine nor by a fashionable defiance. FAGGIOLI: There is another Catholicism that is shaped by dissent against Catholic teaching. But this is not Joe Biden's Catholicism. GJELTEN: American bishops in recent years have focused sharply on policy issues. After Biden's election, Los Angeles Archbishop Jose Gomez, the U.S. Bishops' president, said a task force would consider how they should relate to Biden's presidency. On Inauguration Day, Gomez released a statement guided by that task force that lamented Biden's support for policies that would, quote, \"advance moral evils in such areas as abortion.\" J.D. Flynn, the well-connected editor of The Pillar, a Catholic publication, says Biden may be held to an especially high standard because of his potential influence among American Catholics. JD FLYNN: For some of the bishops, it's a concern that Biden's support of policies that they think are at odds with the Catholic Church might seem to be a Catholic stamp of approval on those policies. GJELTEN: But they have to be careful. Pope Francis congratulated Biden on his inauguration without highlighting areas of disagreement. And some American bishops, including Cardinal Blase Cupich of Chicago, have rallied to Biden's defense. With his weekly Mass attendance, Biden sets an example for American Catholics, one that bishops don't want to undermine. Flynn notes how after his inauguration, the bishops issued statements about some Biden policies they supported. FLYNN: They're trying both to reach out to Biden as a member of their church, as someone who's in the pews every Sunday, but at the same time, speak really clearly about his policies. GJELTEN: With political divisions in the church growing, there's much at stake in how American Catholics relate to their new Catholic president - just the second in U.S. history.

David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler on Dec. 5 in Valdosta, Ga. Both GOP senators ultimately lost their runoff elections this month, handing control of the Senate to Democrats. The Georgia Senate runoffs were the first test of outgoing President Donald Trump's ability to bring his most fervent supporters to the polls without his name on the ballot. And after Republicans lost the seats and their U.S. Senate majority, in Georgia Republican circles, much of the blame has centered on the former president. Trump's refusal to concede his own race and constant questioning of the electoral system's integrity sowed confusion that likely dampened Republican turnout. But it was the campaigns' Trump-centric strategies that left them no room to break away, calling into question the future viability of the strategy in competitive states like Georgia. And with Trump showing no sign of heading toward a quiet post-presidential retirement, the dangers of embracing him too closely could risk other GOP candidates in 2022, when control of the House and Senate could again be up for grabs. \"Telling everyone that the race was stolen when it wasn't cost the Republicans two Senate seats,\" said Erick Erickson, a syndicated conservative radio show host and blogger in Georgia. \"The going all-in on the cult of personality around President Trump hurt them as a result. They had to play up this, 'There's no way Donald Trump could have lost. It had to be stolen from him.' \" In fact, according to sources close to the campaigns, people in and around the White House, including the president's lawyer former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, put near-constant pressure on the two Georgia Republicans, David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, to shape their runoff campaigns around his demands. \"It was a hostage situation every day,\" said one Republican strategist familiar with the campaigns who only agreed to speak on the condition of anonymity. \"We were always trying to guard against the tweet [from Trump],\" the strategist said. \"Every week we had some new sort of demand,\" said another strategist involved with the campaigns. \"Calling for the hand recount. The signature match. A special session. $2,000 [coronavirus relief] checks. Objecting to the electors.\" \"It was, 'If you do not do this, the president will actively work against you and you will lose,' \" he recalled. \"In the president's shadow\" \"What was happening was obvious,\" said Brian Robinson, a Georgia Republican strategist who did not work for either campaign. \"It was obvious from the outside, not just the inside.\" \"Our Republican candidates have been in this corner for a couple of years, having to run 100% unrelenting, un-independently mindedly supporting Trump,\" he said. \" 'Whatever [Trump] says, that's my new position. If it contradicts something I said before, that's fine. It's my new position.' \" The campaign of Loeffler, appointed more than a year ago as a businesswoman and political newcomer, serves as a dramatic example. Once a major Mitt Romney donor, Loeffler has said she was inspired to public service by her predecessor, moderate Republican Sen. Johnny Isakson, who was known for a willingness to periodically break with his party and criticize Trump. Yet in her yearlong campaign, Loeffler rushed to tout an \"100% Trump voting record,\" and centered her candidacy on the president. In fact, her decision to certify the Electoral College vote on Jan. 6, two days after she pledged to object, and one day after she lost the runoff, was the first public glimpse of a split with Trump. \"Everyone I have talked to who's close to her says it's not that she said things she didn't believe when it came to policy,\" Erickson said. \"She is pro-life. She's conservative, fiscal conservative, but she had to be way more about Donald Trump than she would have preferred to be.\" \"She got defined as being in the president's shadow, for better or worse. I don't know that we've really seen who is the real Kelly Loeffler,\" he said. Through a spokesman, Loeffler declined to be interviewed for this story. \"I know her personally, and I just think she is a fine person. I don't think Georgians got to see all of Kelly Loeffler,\" said Eric Tanenblatt, a longtime Georgia Republican strategist and fundraiser. \"Every wind of Trumpism\" Peter Wehner, senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center, is a veteran of the Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush White Houses, and a longtime critic of Trump. He said Loeffler isn't unique among today's Republicans. \"Most Republicans have, to one degree or another, have been bent by Trump and several of them have been broken by Trump,\" he said. Loeffler, he said, seemed to remake herself around Trump in her attempt to win the election. \"She's a politician; she's trying to win,\" he said. \"So she remade herself, not into a conservative but more into an angry populist nationalist reactionary. And she didn't do very well at it.\" \"She was a sort of a typical person in the Republican Party these days. You know, in one of his epistles, the Apostle Paul talks about being blown about by every wind of doctrine. And I think she was being blown about by every wind of Trumpism,\" Wehner said. Erickson argued that Loeffler had no choice politically. She had not been Trump's choice for the Senate appointment. And when Trump's choice, U.S. Rep. Doug Collins, also ran for the Senate seat, Loeffler was forced to campaign to the right, he said. \"She had to lock down the president's base for her and make sure the president did not come out for Doug Collins,\" Erickson said. \"When [she] got into the runoff ... she couldn't walk away from that.\" Liz Mair, a national Republican strategist who worked for a pro-Loeffler PAC during the runoffs, agreed that Loeffler had little choice but to focus on Trump's base at all costs. Plus, she was dealt a near-impossible hand of political cards, Mair argued, as an appointee with a short time frame to get to know voters. \"It was almost like asking her to step into a race and fight an election, not just with both hands tied behind her back, but forcing her to do it also in clown shoes,\" Mair said. Mair said the lesson from Loeffler's race is the same as all other elections: Be authentic. \"I think what you don't want to do is be going out there presenting an image, an impression of you, that doesn't accurately depict who you are. Because generally speaking, I think voters can smell a rat.\" It's a struggle many candidates have had and will continue to have, Mair said, especially in the Trump era of the Republican Party. \"A lot of people are trying to figure out how much they can run exactly the campaign that they want to run, versus the campaign that they feel that they need to run,\" she said. \"That's been a challenge for a lot of people. I certainly don't think that [Loeffler is] the only one that's found that to be true. Nor do I think she will be the last person to find it to be true.\"",

            "article_content": "In many rural, and more conservative corners of the country, reaction to the historic nomination of Joe Biden and the nation's first woman and minority vice president was more muted.  NOEL KING, HOST: Millions of Americans celebrated President Biden's inauguration, but there are also many Americans who don't accept him as the country's leader. Donald Trump's bogus election fraud claims are persisting in more rural, more conservative parts of the country. NPR's Kirk Siegler has the story. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Can I get a shot to go? UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Wow. Thank you. KIRK SIEGLER, BYLINE: The moment Joe Biden was being sworn in as the 46th president of the United States felt like just any other day at the Star Country Cafe in southwest Idaho. It's busy. Some people are going out of their way not to watch or talk to a reporter about the inauguration going on 2,300 miles to the east. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: Thank you for offering, but I'll speak for everybody - no, thank you. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: It's a waste of time. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: It really is. SIEGLER: What's the point? - ask these men sitting around a big table, the local coffee klatch, a morning fixture in small town cafes. They say the liberal news media just twists around what conservatives say. But a few tables over, Michael Lyons is happy to talk. He doesn't think Biden's message of unity is realistic. MICHAEL LYONS: I'm hoping that the Republicans will stick with their values and stick with their - stand by their guns and just impede, if you want to use that word. SIEGLER: Stand firm against the Democrats' agenda, that is. It's a common view here in one of the most conservative states in the nation, where voters went 2 to 1 for Donald Trump. LYONS: Would I prefer him for president? Surely, I would, yes. Yeah. I believe he stood for the same values I stand for. So he's pro-life, pro-morality, pro-country. SIEGLER: Cliche, but this really is Trump country almost everywhere you look, from the ubiquitous blue MAGA flags flying in driveways to even a QAnon bumper sticker in this cafe's parking lot claiming Biden and the Democrats are running a child sex ring. The conspiracy theory that the election was stolen from President Trump is also pervasive. Four years ago, you might have heard liberals in cities blaming Facebook for helping put a reality TV star in the White House. Today, conservatives like George Martin here are the ones pointing their fingers at Big Tech, which they believe helped sway the election to Biden. Martin talked through his face mask as he stood in line outside the local DMV. GEORGE MARTIN: I think every American would want to have an audit of that election. I know that the Democratically controlled Congress isn't interested in that at all. SIEGLER: More than 60 courts have thrown out Trump campaign challenges due to a lack of evidence of voter fraud. There were also two recounts in Georgia and a partial one in Wisconsin. MARTIN: Maybe there wasn't any fraud. But tell you what - you have a lot of people in this country that don't think so - don't think that it was a fair election. And I'm one of them. SIEGLER: Surveys show that large majorities of Republican voters across this country still don't believe Joe Biden legitimately won the election. Two states to the south in Arizona, the state GOP this weekend may vote to censure moderate Republican leaders who didn't support overturning that state's election results. But some longtime party activists there, like Kathleen Winn, say the very public infighting isn't productive. KATHLEEN WINN: I do believe that Republicans will come together, but I think it's got to be for a greater cause. It can't be about being Republican. It's got to be about the things that we stand for. SIEGLER: Winn lives in rock-ribbed conservative Mesa, a Phoenix suburb. She saw problems with the election, too, and is upset Trump isn't getting a second term. But it's time to move on. WINN: I think we are still one of the few countries that - it was founded on fair elections and freedom. And I hope that that continues through this presidency and that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris have a successful presidency because, ultimately, that'll be success for our country. SIEGLER: In conservative America, many Republicans think their success rests on the party holding on to the coalition Trump built, which includes many first-time voters. Spend some time in places like Idaho, and it's clear that's not a guarantee. In Star, a defiant Jason Smith told me he has no plans to vote Republican anymore after this past election. JASON SMITH: We just want to be left alone in this country. Trump was our president. And for most of us, he still is our president. We still follow him. SIEGLER: Kirk Siegler, NPR News, Star, Idaho.

Phil Murphy speaks during an election night event at Grand Arcade at the Pavilion on Nov. 2, 2021 in Asbury Park, N.J. The AP called the race the Democrat on Nov. 3. Gov. Phil Murphy won reelection in New Jersey defeating Republican challenger Jack Ciattarelli, according to a call from the Associated Press. The extremely tight race was perhaps the biggest surprise out of Tuesday's elections. For months, polls have shown that Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy had a comfortable lead \u2014 as much as 11 points according to a Monmouth University poll released last week \u2014 over Ciattarelli. Murphy is the first Democratic governor to be reelected in New Jersey since 1977. Loading... Even though Ciattarelli ran in the 2017 Republican primary for governor, he was largely unknown across the state. But he turned out votes in the Republican stronghold districts of Ocean and Monmouth counties and also did well in suburbs across the state. Morris County, which had recently been shifting blue, supported the Republican. New Jersey has about a million more registered Democrats than Republicans. Both of the state's U.S. senators are Democrats, and both chambers of the state legislature are blue. But gubernatorial races have been much less predictable. The state has more independent voters than members of either party, and that silent majority spoke on Tuesday. New Jersey also has the highest property taxes in the nation, and that issue has toppled previous Democratic governors, despite taxes rising just as much under Republican governors. Ciattarelli focused his campaign on those high taxes and hit Murphy in advertisements and in two debates over a video of Murphy saying if taxes are your issue, then New Jersey probably isn't your state. Murphy says that quote was taken out of context and that he was speaking to a business group, explaining that New Jersey will never be able to compete with low-tax states, but that businesses come for the highly educated workforce, the proximity to major cities and the state's mass transit system. Murphy spent much of the campaign tying Ciattarelli to former President Trump, calling his opponent an extremist and pointing out that Ciattarelli attended a \"Stop the Steal\" rally in New Jersey on the same day as the riot at the U.S. Capitol. In the final weeks of the campaign, the Democratic Party's biggest names visited the state, including President Biden, former President Barack Obama and Vice President Harris. Murphy has been called the most progressive governor in the country by some after boosting the minimum wage, raising taxes on millionaires, mandating sick leave and making community college free for those who can't afford it. He is a former investment banker with Goldman Sachs who spent his own money to run for governor in 2017. The governor pledged in his first campaign to legalize marijuana but couldn't get his plan through the Democratically-controlled legislature. The measure eventually went to voters and was legalized in 2020, drawing the highest voter turnout among 18-to-29-year-olds in the nation. Murphy has been lauded for his leadership during the coronavirus pandemic, according to occasional polls taken over the past two years. New Jersey was one of the first states to be hit by the public health crisis, and it came at a particularly bad time for the governor. In early March, Murphy underwent surgery for a cancerous tumor on his kidney, just as the spread of COVID-19 in New York and New Jersey was becoming apparent. He kept up on developments from his hospital bed and quickly moved to shut down the state. He soon was holding daily briefings that would draw thousands of viewers online. Despite the high marks for his leadership during the pandemic, possibly the biggest blemish on his first term will be the almost 8,000 deaths at nursing homes in a little more than a year, including two facilities for veterans. Murphy defends his record, saying the state was hurt by being among the first to face the pandemic, without adequate supplies of protective equipment or anyplace to send residents when they were ready to return home from the hospital. Ciattarelli is a former member of the state Assembly who lost the Republican primary for governor in 2017. He was known as a moderate during his time at the state capitol in Trenton, but ran to the right during his primary, attending a \"Stop the Steal\" rally on Jan. 6, the day of the riot at the U.S. capitol. He promised to lower property taxes, roll back police reforms, cut funding to Planned Parenthood and slow the climate change actions taken by Murphy. Phil Murphy was born in 1957 and raised in Needham, Mass. His mother was a secretary and his father held a series of low-paying jobs. He attended Harvard University and the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania. He rose quickly through the ranks at Goldman Sachs. He became very wealthy, retired young and raised money for the 2004 campaign for Barack Obama, who rewarded him with an ambassadorship in Germany. Murphy and his wife, Tammy, have four children and live in a waterfront estate in Middletown, N.J. The last Democrat to win a second term was Brenden Byrne in 1977.",

            "article_content": "I was a Catholic schoolgirl during a strange moment in the 1960s when Catholicism infiltrated American popular culture. For a brief time, nuns, in particular, were everywhere. The Flying Nun starring a buoyant Sally Field was on TV, \"Singing Nun\" Jeanine Deckers appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show and her life was made into a movie; there was The Trouble with Angels and the \"Mother Superior\" of all nun movies, The Sound of Music. Nuns, of course, have greatly diminished in number since the '60s and, in recent decades, when they do make an occasional appearance on screen they're often grim, even baroque characters like Meryl Streep's Sister Aloysius in Doubt or Jessica Lange's Sister Jude in American Horror Story. The implication is that there must be something \"off\" about a woman who would choose such a life of self-abnegation. Claire Luchette's debut novel, Agatha of Little Neon, offers a counter-narrative about a young 21st-century nun who's neither a holy fool nor a musical miracle worker nor a monster. I picked up Agatha of Little Neon for its unusual subject and I got pulled in by Agatha's voice. Sharp and, by turns, melancholy and wry, Agatha narrates her own belated coming-of-age tale about, as she says, learning \"how to distinguish an idea of yourself from the real thing.\" Agatha tells her story in retrospect, beginning in 2005 in her convent outside of Buffalo, N.Y. It's a place with walls painted \"the color of mayonnaise,\" ruled by a beloved elderly Mother Superior who is \"frail as filament.\" Agatha has spent seven years there, ever since she took her vows at the age of 22. She and three fellow sisters \u2014 all the same age \u2014 run a day care center; but, when the novel opens, the diocese is going broke because, as Agatha tactfully says, \"the men in charge had been reckless.\" Later on, when Agatha is \"all out of deference,\" she's more lacerating about the \"recklessness\" \u2014 sexual as well as monetary \u2014 of those priests who are \"in charge.\" Abruptly booted out of their convent, the four sisters are transferred to a half-way house in the depressed Rhode Island town of Woonsocket. There, without any training, they're expected to minister to recovering addicts and ex-convicts. Here's Agatha's first impression of her new posting: Woonsocket: a tuckered-out town in northern Rhode Island, split down the middle by a river of waste. The sidewalks were littered with condoms and crushed empties. From Woonsocket you could vomit into Massachusetts; from Massachusetts, kids came to buy liquor and fentanyl after nine. The half-way house is \"the color of Mountain Dew\" \u2014 a yellow-green discount paint that makes the house visible \"from three streets away.\" Hence the name: \"Little Neon.\"  Agatha observes that usually \"[w]hen people saw our habits, they ceased to see our faces\" and most of the half-way house residents behave that way, barely interacting with the sisters. But one recovering addict named Tim Gary is different. Tim, who's lost half his jawbone to cancer and got hooked on Dilaudid, recognizes a fellow lost soul in Agatha. And Agatha is further pulled away from her community when she's ordered to teach geometry at a nearby girls' Catholic high school \u2014 an ordeal that should qualify her for sainthood. What's especially striking about Luchette's novel is that it affirms the age-old writing workshop wisdom of \"show don't tell.\" Despite the fact that our narrator, Agatha, lives a contemplative life, she doesn't devote a lot of space to ruminations. Instead, every short chapter here is structured as a precise vignette dramatizing different incidents in her and her fellow sisters' lives from the mundane to the harrowing: For instance, there's the poverty of regular mealtimes at Little Neon where cut-rate concoctions like chopped walnut tacos make appearances; and a scene where Agatha describes how her mother hemorrhaged to death after giving birth to a baby brother and how, for a grieving Agatha, church was the only thing in her life that \"pulled [her] forward.\" Until it doesn't. You could learn to live without a part of yourself [Agatha tells us] ... I did. For years, I lived like this. And then I started to yearn for what I had lost. You don't have to be Catholic to connect with Luchette's nuanced and vivid story of a lonely young woman yearning for community and also yearning for everything she's had to give up to be part of that community. The nuns don't fly or sing or torment the helpless in Agatha of Little Neon, but they do make an indelible impression.",

President Bill Clinton had his eye on the future when he nominated Stephen Breyer to the Supreme Court in 1994. \"Judge Breyer will bring to the court a well-recognized and impressive ability to build bridges in pursuit of fairness and justice,\" Clinton said in announcing his nomination. \"In the generations ahead, the Supreme Court will face questions of overriding national importance, many of which we cannot today even imagine.\" It's not just the things the court has ruled on that have changed; the atmosphere around Supreme Court confirmations has shifted dramatically. A few decades ago, nominees often came out of Senate confirmation with large, bipartisan majorities. Breyer was confirmed 87 to 9. But as Congress has grown more ideologically polarized \u2014 and after bitter Obama- and Trump-era battles over Supreme Court seats \u2014 those confirmations have become much narrower. That is why many on the left are hoping that, after nearly three decades on the high court, Breyer has his eye on the exit. With Democrats holding the White House and the barest of Senate majorities, there is immense urgency among progressives for Breyer to announce his retirement when the Supreme Court term ends around the end of June. That push is amplified by interest and organizing among Democrats that's centered on the courts and has increased as Republicans built a 6-3 conservative majority in the Supreme Court over the last four years. \"If Justice Breyer is to be committed to his judicial ideology, he is going to want to be replaced on the bench by someone who is going to vote to uphold the fundamental right to vote in this country and to protect the rights of the most marginalized members of our society,\" said Rep. Mondaire Jones, D-N.Y. Breyer has helped deliver landmark rulings that have broadly pleased Democrats \u2014 rulings in favor of LGBTQ rights and reproductive rights, for example. And now, a groundswell of progressives like Jones is urging the 82-year-old Breyer to retire in order to safeguard his seat with a new liberal justice. The stakes for Democrats were made stark by former President Donald Trump's three Supreme Court nominations \u2014 one came after Republicans refused to hold hearings for Obama nominee Merrick Garland in 2016. The other two replaced swing-vote Anthony Kennedy after he retired and liberal Ruth Bader Ginsburg after she died shortly before the 2020 election, swaying the balance of the court toward conservatives. To Jones, that was entirely avoidable. \"President Obama could have had the opportunity to appoint more justices to the Supreme Court than he ultimately did,\" Jones said. \"And that was the result of a decision by senior-in-age justices not to retire and give him that opportunity.\" The pressure from Democrats for Breyer to step down is often carefully crafted, with respect for the liberal justice. Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal told The Washington Post in April, \"Justice Breyer has been a great justice, and he recognizes, I am sure, the political reality of our having control of the Senate now. But elections always have risks, so hopefully he's aware of that risk and he sees it accordingly.\" The push is about making the court a backstop on an array of issues. \"We have our eyes on the Supreme Court around issues around abortion, birth control, health insurance, LGBT issues, immigration, kind of the gamut,\" said Rachel Carmona, executive director of Women's March. But any pressure, whether from interest groups, lawmakers or even the White House, may have precisely zero effect on Breyer's decision-making, according to Neil Eggleston, White House counsel for President Barack Obama from 2014 until 2017. \"I don't think a call from the White House or even pressure from interest groups is going to matter much to Justice Breyer,\" he said. \"The way I think about it is, a call from the White House or a call from interest groups are not adding more information that he doesn't already have in connection with what he's going to decide to do.\" The Supreme Court justices pose for a group photo on April 23.\n                \n                    \n                    Erin Schaff/Pool/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption The Supreme Court justices pose for a group photo on April 23. Eggleston explained how he considered whether the White House should talk retirement with the elderly Justice Ginsburg during his tenure at the White House. But then Eggleston decided against it. \"It's a little unseemly for a White House to suggest to a justice that they should retire and that the White House didn't have any information that Justice Ginsburg didn't already have, and so I just decided she would decide what she thought was appropriate,\" he said. And that may be how President Biden is thinking. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said last month that Biden believes retirement is Breyer's choice. One group pushing Breyer to step down is Demand Justice, which sent a black and neon-green billboard truck driving around the Supreme Court building last month. The billboard's message: \"Breyer, retire. It's time for a Black woman Supreme Court justice,\" referencing Biden's campaign vow to nominate a Black woman to the court. \"What we're trying to do with tactics like the billboard truck that we had [in April] is to show that this is the time in which Supreme Court justices have in the past announced their retirements,\" said Christopher Kang, chief counsel for Demand Justice. He's referring to the end of the term, typically in late June, a time when past justices, including Kennedy, announced their retirements. For his part, Jones thinks next month is when calls from Capitol Hill might get louder. \"I think it is logical to assume that if Justice Breyer decides for some reason not to retire at the end of this term, there will be a chorus of Democrats calling on him to do the right thing and be a good steward of our democracy,\" he said. The slim Democratic Senate majority right now also has Kang fearing worst-case scenarios. \"While hopefully we have this majority for until the end of 2022, really this majority could go at any moment, given sort of the potential health or something else that might happen,\" he said. Part of Demand Justice's goal is also to further energize Democratic voters around the cause ahead of 2022. \"We're trying to raise awareness among voters and lawmakers right now in particular,\" he said. \"We've seen over the last several years, Democrats in particular have become much more engaged around the Supreme Court.\" While exit polls in 2016 showed Trump winning voters most concerned about the court, exit polls from 2020 suggested Democrats gained ground with those voters.",

John Lewis, D-Ga., last year, former President Barack Obama called on the Senate to eliminate the filibuster, if needed, to secure voting rights.\n                \n                    \n                    Alyssa Pointer/Pool/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption At the funeral of the late congressman and civil rights leader Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., last year, former President Barack Obama called on the Senate to eliminate the filibuster, if needed, to secure voting rights. To a growing number of Democrats, the filibuster is a giant barrier to the things they want to accomplish. At the funeral last year for congressman and civil rights hero John Lewis, former President Barack Obama listed some of them: ending partisan gerrymandering and making Election Day a national holiday, as well as statehood for Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico. \"And if all this takes eliminating the filibuster \u2014 another Jim Crow relic \u2014 in order to secure the God-given rights of every American, then that's what we should do,\" Obama said, instantly resetting the debate over the Senate procedure that allows a minority party with 41 votes to stop most legislation. Obama defined the debate over the filibuster as an existential question for the future of American democracy. Now that Democrats have control of the White House and Congress for the first time in a decade, with voting rights as a top priority, Obama's argument has become central for the party. Even President Biden, a champion of Senate tradition who has resisted calls to scrap the filibuster, opened a path last week to someday backing its demise, and he endorsed the idea that it's a civil rights issue. Now that the filibuster is the biggest obstacle to Biden's agenda, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., is threatening the GOP: Compromise with us or we'll nuke the filibuster. Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has a counter threat, that nuking the filibuster will bring a \"nuclear winter\" on the Senate floor. \"Nobody serving in this chamber can even begin \u2014 can even begin \u2014 to imagine what a completely scorched-earth Senate would look like,\" McConnell said. He warned of a \"100 car pileup\" with constant quorum calls and senators required to be physically present in the Capitol day and night for the chamber to function. Then he gave Democrats a picture of what he says would happen when Republicans regain control of the majority: \"We wouldn't just erase every liberal change that hurt the country. We'd strengthen America with all kinds of conservative policies with zero input from the other side.\" Loading... That could mean a long list of payback: nationwide right to work laws, defunding Planned Parenthood and sanctuary cities, concealed-carry reciprocity in all 50 states. \"If there's one thing I've learned over the last 20 years, it's when Mitch McConnell makes a threat, Mitch McConnell follows through with a threat,\" said Josh Holmes, McConnell's former chief of staff. But Democrats don't seem scared. A scorched-earth Senate would be hard for McConnell to maintain, they say, since Republicans would suffer too. Also, reversing popular legislation isn't easy, which Republicans learned when they had the majority and couldn't find 51 votes to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, after nearly a decade of campaigning to repeal it. This isn't the first time senators have considered changing the filibuster. It once took 67 votes to break the filibuster; that was reduced to 60. There was an exemption made for fiscal policy with the budget reconciliation process that was used to pass Obamacare, the 2017 GOP tax cut bill and Biden's $1.9 trillion pandemic relief package. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., warned Democrats not to abolish the filibuster, saying that he would use procedures to turn the Senate into \"a 100-car pileup, nothing moving.\"\n                \n                    \n                    Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., warned Democrats not to abolish the filibuster, saying that he would use procedures to turn the Senate into \"a 100-car pileup, nothing moving.\" In 2013, Democratic Majority Leader Harry Reid got rid of the filibuster for the Cabinet, other executive branch nominees and lower court judges. In 2017, after Republicans had taken hold of both houses of Congress and the White House, McConnell expanded that exemption to Supreme Court nominees. That means it takes 60 votes to pass a law, but only 51 to give someone a lifetime of power to rule whether that law is constitutional. \"And lo and behold, within the next six years, not only did Republicans take advantage of it, they put three times as many judges on the courts than Democrats did in the same amount of time. They confirmed three Supreme Court justices,\" said Holmes. \"What he was able to accomplish with judicial nominations over the last four years is like a conservative Mount Rushmore moment.\" The history of the filibuster is inseparable from the struggle for equal rights. From the end of Reconstruction to 1964, the filibuster was used almost exclusively to block civil rights bills. After that, its appeal spread far beyond the segregationist cause. Loading... \"Other senators had seen how effective it was as a legislative tool of obstruction against civil rights and decided to start experimenting with it on their own pet issues,\" said Democrat Adam Jentleson, who was chief of staff to Reid and the author of the book Kill Switch: The Rise of the Modern Senate and the Crippling of American Democracy. Since the civil rights era, the filibuster was made easier to use. Senators didn't have to stand on the floor and keep talking like Jimmy Stewart in Mr. Smith Goes To Washington. A simple phone call to the Senate cloakroom was all it took to start a filibuster. Since it became painless to use, more senators began using it. \"So that is why today we sort of consider it an accepted fact of life that everything that happens in the Senate needs to clear 60 votes,\" Jentleson said. Jimmy Stewart's 1939 performance in Mr. Smith Goes To Washington helped form the popular perception of a Senate filibuster, with a lawmaker talking for hours on end. It hasn't been like that for decades, but President Biden supports returning to that style.\n                \n                    \n                    Columbia/Kobal/Shutterstock\n                    \n                \nhide caption Jimmy Stewart's 1939 performance in Mr. Smith Goes To Washington helped form the popular perception of a Senate filibuster, with a lawmaker talking for hours on end. It hasn't been like that for decades, but President Biden supports returning to that style. Democrats and Republicans alike learned to love the filibuster when they were in the Senate minority and loathe it when they were in the majority. But so far opponents of the legislative filibuster don't have the 50 Democratic votes they need to end it, with West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema and others perhaps open to changes, but not to eliminating the filibuster altogether. To convince every Democratic senator to abandon the filibuster, it would have to be connected to a bill the public really wants to pass, according to Jentleson. \"When you ask the public about the filibuster in the abstract, it usually comes in about 50-50. But when you attach it to a popular issue, the polling shifts dramatically, and the public strongly favors reform,\" he said. Democrats say they first need to wait and see whether Republicans use it to block popular pieces of Biden's agenda, maybe infrastructure, gun background checks, a minimum wage hike or a renewal of the Voting Rights Act. \"Attaching filibuster reform to a very popular policy is the way to go. The public has consistently shown that what they want is results. They want to see their lawmakers deliver popular policies that improve their lives. And they are not particularly concerned about what procedures lawmakers use to get that done,\" said Jentleson. Then there's the question of President Biden. He has talked about the kind of reform Manchin wants to see, to return to the days when a senator would have to stand on the floor and talk for hours, to make it more \"painful\" to filibuster, as Manchin puts it. While members of both parties agree that the filibuster in its current form probably won't last much longer, it's also not clear that the return of talking filibusters would break gridlock in the Senate. At his press conference on Thursday, Biden seemed to signal he could envision a drastic scenario that would push him toward abolishing the filibuster. \"If there's complete lockdown and chaos as a consequence of the filibuster, then we'll have to go beyond what I'm talking about,\" Biden said. A reporter followed up after Biden said he agreed with Obama's definition of the filibuster as \"a relic of Jim Crow.\" Why is that not enough cause to get rid of it? Biden had to think for a moment. \"Successful electoral politics is the art of the possible,\" he responded. While many Democrats see an opportunity to stop a minority party from blocking broadly popular legislation, Biden was making it clear he still hasn't given up on the cooperation and bipartisanship he promised to bring back to Washington, yet.",

Undoing many of the policies of his predecessor is one of President Biden's top priorities. In early February, Biden even got a little defensive about all the executive actions he was taking in his first days in office to halt policies set by President Donald Trump. \"I'm not making new law,\" he said Feb. 2. \"I'm eliminating bad policy.\" Among other issues, there are more than three dozen health-related policies \u2014 including many aimed at hobbling the Affordable Care Act \u2014 put into place   during the Trump administration that Democrats would like to see changed. But as easy as it sounds on the campaign hustings or in a 30-second political ad, it's complicated to overturn rules from earlier administrations. There is one tool, however, that Biden and the Democratic Congress could use to undo the policies the Trump administration left behind. A little-used law called the Congressional Review Act allows a new administration with a like-minded Congress to fast-track the repeal of regulations and other executive actions with simple majority votes in both chambers and no filibuster in the Senate. So far, though, Congress has made no attempt to use it, and the president has not called for it. And it appears there are no specific plans to do so, at least not on health-related policies. Time is of the essence when it comes to using the CRA. With a few exceptions, it applies to only those Trump administration policies finalized between Aug. 21, 2020, and Jan. 20, 2021. And it's available for only the first 60 legislative days \u2014 those that either the House or Senate is officially working in Washington \u2014 of the new Congress. That end date will likely land sometime in April. Kaiser Health News is tracking the health-related regulations, guidance and executive orders implemented during Trump's term and whether those policies will continue under the Biden administration or be overturned. Trump and the GOP-controlled Congress were not shy about using the CRA to eliminate policies implemented by the Obama administration. Between Feb. 14 and May 17, 2017, Congress passed and the president signed rollbacks of 14 regulations,   according to the Congressional Research Service. Before 2017, the 1996 law had been used only once \u2014 when the new George W. Bush administration and GOP-led Congress repealed a Clinton-era worker safety rule in 2001. But experts said it's not surprising that the Democrats haven't followed that pattern this year. \"The CRA is such a blunt instrument,\" says Daniel P\u00e9rez, a senior policy analyst at George Washington University's Regulatory Policy Center. \"There are other tools at their disposal.\" Using the act is also risky. Under its provisions, once a policy is repealed, no administration can issue a \"substantially similar\" regulation. But how similar is too similar? No one knows, and it's never been tested. \"It's kind of a legal gray area,\" says P\u00e9rez. The Biden administration may well be the one to test that. One regulation repealed by the Republican Congress using the Congressional Review Act in 2017 dealt with the Title X family planning program. The Obama-era rule forbade state health departments from withholding Title X funding as long as organizations were able to provide family planning services. Several states had banned Planned Parenthood affiliates and other clinics that performed abortions from participating in the program. Title X has not, from its inception in 1970, funded abortions, but abortion providers have long participated to provide contraceptive and other health services. Family planning groups would like to see those state policies blocked once again. But the failure to use the Congressional Review Act may be about more than just getting organized in time. Many Trump policy changes that Democrats may want to ditch were part of larger regulations that touched a wide variety of subjects and could include policies that Biden's team wants to keep. But Congress can't dismiss only part of a rule. \"The nature of health care rule-making is they tend to be omnibus,\" says Katie Keith, a health policy researcher and law professor at Georgetown University. For example, a Jan. 19 regulation finalized by the Trump administration cuts funding for Affordable Care Act marketplace operations and codifies changes that would make it easier for states to create health plans that do not include all the protections offered by the ACA. But those changes are embedded within a much larger regulation required each year to keep the health law operating. Biden administration officials, rather than try to repeal the entire regulation, will likely rewrite just the pieces they disagree with. That will take significant time and resources. That raises another hurdle the White House has encountered as it tries to change health policy. The Senate has yet to confirm a director for the Office of Management and Budget, and new Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra was sworn in only last week. Both agencies are required for health regulations to proceed. \"My own two cents is this is not the product of a deliberate decision not to use the CRA,\" says Sara Rosenbaum, a health law and policy professor at George Washington University. \"It's more a problem with the messiness they have run into with starting up the new administration. They don't know what they want to do with these rules.\" And the transition period was especially tumultuous. Both the Biden administration and the new Congress were delayed in getting organized. First, Trump refused to concede the election \u2014 which sparked a mob attack on the Capitol. Then, once it was official that Biden had won, the Senate \u2014 now evenly split, 50-50 \u2014 didn't change hands to Democratic control until Inauguration Day, when Vice President Kamala Harris became the tie-breaking vote. An agreement on how to run the Senate and committees took even longer to negotiate between the Democrats and Republicans. Plus, before two Democratic challengers swept the Jan. 5 Georgia runoffs, most people thought the Senate would remain in Republican hands, so the CRA would not have been a viable option. Even when Democrats assumed control of the Senate and White House, the early weeks were crowded with an impeachment trial, efforts to get control of the pandemic response and the COVID-19 relief bill that passed earlier this month. It's not too late for Congress to turn to the Congressional Review Act. Keith says one possible use would be on a last-minute Trump regulation known as the sunset rule. It requires HHS to review 18,000 of its regulations, and those not reviewed within a set period will automatically end. A group of health and other interest groups, led by Santa Clara County in California, sued to block the rule March 9. But congressional action could be a cleaner way to end the rule. \"That strikes me as something the Democrats would like to see never come back again,\" said Keith.

Conservative broadcaster Rush Limbaugh, who entertained millions and propelled waves of Republican politicians, has died at age 70. He had announced to listeners last year that he had stage four lung cancer. Limbaugh's death Wednesday morning was confirmed by his wife, Kathryn, at the start of his radio program. Before right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, before Fox News, there was Limbaugh. His voice entertained millions of listeners, cheered conservatives hungry to see their beliefs reflected on the airwaves, and elevated long-shot Republicans to national prominence. \"I always say my real purpose is to attract the largest audience I can, and hold it for as long as I can, so I can charge confiscatory advertising rates,\" Limbaugh told NPR in a 2007 interview. \"Every time I've said that, it's, 'Oh, he's just saying that! He doesn't care what he says! He's just trying to generate a big audience!' And that's not true. The benefit here is, I have the freedom to be entirely honest about my passions.\" Limbaugh's clout in conservative circles was so great that he was wooed by three very different Republican presidents: George H.W. Bush, George W. Bush and Donald Trump, the latter a kindred spirit in many ways who awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom at the State of the Union address in February 2020. Limbaugh was an influencer before the age of social media, a hot-take machine before people stopped pausing to think about what they were saying ahead of sending those words out into the world. And he embodied a counterpunch to what many on the right contended was a liberal media establishment \u2014 even as he offended millions with his racist, sexist and homophobic routines and diatribes. Rush Hudson Limbaugh III was born in 1951 in Cape Girardeau, Mo., where there is now an official Rush Limbaugh hometown tour. His family maintained Republican ties: His grandfather had been an ambassador under President Dwight D. Eisenhower; his uncle was named a federal judge by President Ronald Reagan. His father was an attorney locally, while his mother was active in local Republican politics. He got his start at a station partly owned by his father, and his early years in radio were marked by clashes with bosses. But after the Reagan administration set aside the Fairness Doctrine, which instructed broadcasters to present opposing views on controversial issues, Limbaugh unleashed his buoyant conservatism to great effect in Sacramento, Calif., and then New York City. And in his emergence on the national scene in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the man perfectly met the moment. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and his allies would give Limbaugh a huge amount of credit for the GOP's rise in 1994, when the party took over the U.S. House and Senate for the first time in four decades. \"Talk radio, with you in the lead, is what turned the tide, Rush, and we know that,\" U.S. Rep. Barbara Cubin of Wyoming, part of the wave of Republicans who swept to office that year, said in honoring Limbaugh at an event staged by the conservative Heritage Foundation. \"You were the voice that everyone else could follow.\" She gave him a plaque that read: \"Rush was right.\" No one believed that more than Limbaugh himself. \"There's a whole psychology of doing the program the way that I do it,\" Limbaugh told NPR. \"And there is a lot of schtick and a lot of humor to it. But  the one thing that I don't do is make things up or say things I don't believe, just to cause a reaction. Because that takes no talent.\" In the early-to-mid 1990s, Limbaugh hosted a TV show run by Roger Ailes, who went on to help Rupert Murdoch create and run the Fox News Channel. But radio proved to be Limbaugh's perfect medium. The show ran for three hours every weekday. Limbaugh riffed on the news, largely without guests to interview. Instead, he read and responded to news articles with opinions and voices, pumping the program with satire and parody, puffing himself up while mocking himself thoroughly. He promoted conservative priorities such as deregulation, lower taxes for the wealthy, and muscular military intervention in the Middle East. He also cast doubt on established facts, including global warming, and propelled conspiracy theories, such as the baseless claim that Joe Biden's address to the 2020 Democratic National Convention had to be stitched together from numerous takes. And Limbaugh staked his claim for a vision of the United States that resurrected a more seemingly traditional, more conservative and whiter past. In so doing, he trampled the boundaries of acceptable political discourse. He often traded on decades-old stereotypes to offend women, Blacks, Latinos, gays and liberals. As a local host in Pittsburgh in the mid 1970s, Limbaugh later conceded to an interviewer for Newsday, he told a Black woman who called into his show that she should \"take the bone\" out of her nose and he would call her back. He told the reporter he regretted that. Broadcasting under his own name in New York City, Limbaugh claimed that all newspaper composites of wanted criminals resembled the Rev. Jesse Jackson. Over the years, he routinely questioned President Barack Obama's heritage and patriotism and mocked Michelle Obama's physique. He could be especially cruel and offensive when his targets were women. Limbaugh called Hillary Clinton a \"FemiNazi\" \u2014 a term he coined for feminists. He called a graduate student a slut for her advocacy for medical insurance to cover birth control. \"I wonder when she loses next, if she'll go back to the kitchen,\" Limbaugh mused on air when Nancy Pelosi became the first female speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives. Then he adopted the tone of a Pelosi fan: \"Look at Ms. Pelosi. Why, she can multitask. She can breastfeed, she can clip her toenails, she can direct the House, all while kids are sitting on her lap at the same time.\" Most of the time, Limbaugh relished the ensuing outcries. \"The fewest number of words you can use to convey a point, the more power a point has,\" Limbaugh said in the NPR interview.  \"Now, I understand people are going to be offended. But I've had a policy all my life not to worry about offending people, because it's going to happen. It's a daily part of life.\" And yet that could come with a cost. As ABC experimented with Monday Night Football, Limbaugh auditioned for a nonsports specialist slot. It went to the comedian Dennis Miller. He was hired in 2003 to be a commentator for a football program that aired Sundays on ESPN (ABC's sister channel). After four weeks, he was fired after disparaging then-Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Donovan McNabb, who is Black. \"The media has been very desirous that a Black quarterback do well,'' Limbaugh said. \"There is a little hope invested in McNabb, and he got a lot of credit for the performance of this team that he didn't deserve. The defense carried this team.\" Two days later, McNabb commented to the Philadelphia Daily News, \"It's sad that you've got to go to skin color. I thought we were through with that whole deal.\" ESPN soon announced that Limbaugh resigned. On his radio show, however, he was unrepentant. Over the years, Limbaugh allowed listeners into a more human dimension of his persona. There was his loss of hearing \u2014 at the core of a radio performer's abilities \u2014 that led to cochlear implants. He also acknowledged his addiction to opioids, as that became public knowledge elsewhere. And in early 2020, the frequent cigar smoker revealed his diagnosis of lung cancer. Trump bestowed  the Presidential Medal of Freedom on him shortly afterward, calling him a fighter. Limbaugh repaid the favor a few weeks before the 2020 election, turning hours of his broadcast over to the embattled president for a virtual rally just weeks ahead of Election Day, after Trump had contracted COVID-19. Later that month, Limbaugh announced that his cancer was terminal. \"It's tough to realize that the days where I do not think that I'm under a death sentence are over,\" he told his listeners. Limbaugh said the challenges he had faced were no bigger, and no more important, than theirs.",

Even with Democrats technically in the majority in Congress, the party split is so slim that passing major health care legislation will be extremely difficult. So speculation about President-elect Joe Biden's health agenda has focused on the things he can accomplish using executive authority. Although there is a long list of things he could do, even longer is the list of things he is being urged to undo \u2014 actions taken by President Trump. While Trump was not able to make good on his highest-profile health-related promises from his 2016 campaign \u2014 including repealing the Affordable Care Act and broadly lowering prescription drug prices \u2014 his administration did make substantial changes to the nation's health care system using executive branch authority. And many of those changes are anathema to Democrats, particularly those aimed at hobbling the ACA. For example, the Trump administration made it easier for those who buy their own insurance to purchase cheaper plans that don't cover all the ACA benefits and may not cover pre-existing conditions. It also eliminated protections from discrimination in health care to people who are transgender. Trump's use of tools like regulations, guidance and executive orders to modify health programs \"was like an attack by a thousand paper cuts,\" said Maura Calsyn, managing director of health policy at the Center for American Progress, a liberal-leaning think tank. Approaching the November election, she said, \"the administration was in the process of doing irreparable harm to the nation's health care system.\" Reversing many of those changes will be a big part of Biden's health agenda, in many cases coming even before trying to act on his own campaign pledges, such as creating a government-sponsored health plan as part of the ACA. Chris Jennings, a health aide to former Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, said he refers to those Trump health policies as \"bird droppings. As in you have to clean up the bird droppings before you have a clean slate.\" Republicans, when they take over from a Democratic administration, think of their predecessors' policies the same way. Though changing policies made by the executive branch seems easy, that's not always the case. \"These are issue-by-issue determinations that must be made, and they require process evaluation, legal evaluation, resource consideration and timeliness,\" said Jennings. In other words, some policies will take more time and personnel resources than others. And health policies will have to compete for White House attention with policies the new administration will want to change on anything from the environment to immigration to education. Even within health care, issues as diverse as the operations of the ACA marketplaces to women's reproductive health to stem cell research will vie to be high on the list. Why the changes are hard to reverse Some types of actions are easier to reverse than others. Executive orders issued by the president, for example, can be summarily overturned by a new executive order. Agency \"guidance\" can similarly be written over, although the Trump administration has worked to make that more onerous. Since the 1980s, for example, every time the presidency has changed parties, one of the incoming president's first actions has been to issue an executive order to either reimpose or eliminate the \"Mexico City Policy\" that governs funding for international family planning organizations that \"perform or promote\" abortion. Why do new administrations address abortion so quickly? Because the anniversary of the landmark Supreme Court abortion decision Roe v. Wade is two days after Inauguration Day, so the action is always politically timely. Harder to change are formal regulations, such as one effectively banning Planned Parenthood from the federal family planning program, Title X. They are governed by a law, the Administrative Procedure Act, that lays out a very specific \u2014 and often time-consuming \u2014 process. \"You have to cross your i's and dot your legal t's,\" said Nicholas Bagley, who teaches administrative law at the University of Michigan Law School. And if you don't? Then regulations can be challenged in court \u2014 as those of the Trump administration were dozens of times. That's something Biden officials will take pains to avoid, said Calsyn. \"I would expect to see very deliberate notice and comment rule-making, considering the reshaped judiciary\" with so many Trump-appointed judges, she said. What comes first? Undoing a previous administration's actions in a new administration is an exercise in trying to push many things through a very narrow tube in a short time. Department regulations have to go not just through the leadership in each department, but also through the Office of Management and Budget \"for a technical review, cost-benefit analysis and legal authority,\" said Bagley. \"That can take time.\" Complicating matters, many health regulations emanate not just from the Department of Health and Human Services, but jointly from HHS and other departments, including Labor and Treasury, which likely means more time to negotiate decisions among multiple departments. Finally, said Bagley, \"for really high-profile things, you've got to get the president's attention, and he's got limited time, too.\" Anything pandemic-related is likely to come first, he said. Some items get pushed to the front of the line due to calendar considerations, as with the abortion executive orders. Others need more immediate attention because they are part of active court cases. \"You have all these court schedules and briefing schedules that will dictate the timeline where they make all these decisions,\" said Katie Keith, a health policy researcher and law professor at Georgetown University. A high-profile example in that category is the Trump administration's efforts to allow states to set work requirements for many low-income adults who gained Medicaid coverage under the Affordable Care Act's expansion of the program. The Supreme Court has agreed to hear a case challenging HHS approval of work requirements for Arkansas and New Hampshire in the next few months. Some Democrats are concerned about how the high court with its new conservative majority might rule, and the Biden administration will have to move fast if officials decide they want to head off that case. But court actions also might help the Biden administration short-circuit the onerous regulatory process. If a regulation the new administration wants to rewrite or repeal has already been blocked by a court, Biden officials can simply choose not to appeal that ruling. That's what Trump did in ending insurance company subsidies for enrollees with low incomes in 2017. Allowing a lower-court ruling to stand, however, is not a foolproof strategy. \"That raises the possibility of having someone [else] intervene,\" said Keith. For example, Democratic attorneys general stepped in to defend the ACA in a case now pending at the Supreme Court when the Trump administration chose not to. \"So, you have to be pretty strategic about not appealing,\" she said. Adding on? One other big decision for the incoming administration is whether it wants to use the opportunity to tweak or add to Trump policies rather than eliminate them. \"Is it undoing and full stop?\" asked Keith. \"Or undoing and adding on?\" She said there is \"a full slate of ideologically neutral\" policies Trump put out, including ones on price transparency and prescription drugs. If Biden officials don't want to keep those as they are, they can rewrite them and advance other policies at the same time, saving a round of regulatory effort. But none of it is easy \u2014 or fast. One big problem is just having enough bodies available to do the work. \"There was so much that undermined and hollowed out the federal workforce; there's a lot of rebuilding that needs to done,\" said Calsyn of the Center for American Progress. And Trump officials ran so roughshod over the regulatory process in many cases, she said, \"even putting those processes back in place is going to be hard.\" Incoming officials will also have other time-sensitive work to do. Writing regulations for the newly passed ban on \"surprise\" medical bills will almost certainly be a giant political fight between insurers and health care providers, who will try to re-litigate the legislation as it is implemented. Rules for insurers who sell policies under the ACA will need to be written almost immediately after Biden takes office. Anyone waiting for a particular Trump policy to be wiped from the books will likely have to pack their patience. But law professor Bagley said he's optimistic it will all get done. \"One of the things we've grown unaccustomed to is a competent administration,\" he said. \"When people are competent, they can do a lot of things pretty quickly.\" KHN (Kaiser Health News) is a nonprofit news service covering health issues.

            "article_content": "The latest polling shows that Newsom is likely to walk away from the recall election vote a winner. But just in case, he's been getting his message out to voters, as have his competitors.  AILSA CHANG, HOST: And this is it. Today is the last day for voters here in California to weigh in on the recall effort against Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom. The latest polling shows that Newsom is likely to walk away from tonight the winner. But just in case, he's been getting his message out to voters during this last day, and so have his competitors, including Larry Elder, the conservative talk radio host. Following the race tonight and joining us with more is Nicole Nixon, CapRadio's politics reporter. Welcome. NICOLE NIXON, BYLINE: Thanks for having me. CHANG: All right, so polls close in just about two hours here in California. When might we know the outcome of this race, you think? NIXON: We could know tonight, but it's also possible we don't know for another day or two. CHANG: (Laughter). NIXON: That's because this is an all - a mail-in election. Every active voter got a ballot mailed to them, so voting has actually been going on for several weeks now. And according to a company that tracks ballot data here in California, nearly 9.5 million ballots have already been turned back in. So election officials will do a big dump of results right when polls close around 8:00 from those mail-in ballots, but we'll also get additional updates throughout the night with some in-person results too. CHANG: Right. OK, so what has been the message from Newsom and the Democratic camp as this election finally winds up? NIXON: Yeah, Democrats have really tried to nationalize this election and make it about issues like reproductive rights, voting rights and workers' rights that we're hearing about across the country. And the frontrunner in the field to replace Newsom is Larry Elder. Like you mentioned, he's a conservative talk radio host. He's a Trump supporter, so Democrats have been able to make this a sort of Newsom-versus-Elder type of race. Here's Newsom earlier today during a campaign stop in San Francisco. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) GAVIN NEWSOM: Just consider the fundamental contrast that's on the ballot. You know this. It's not even close. If we don't reject this recall, Larry Elder is the next governor of the state of California. (BOOING) NEWSOM: I'm going to sound like Obama. Don't boo, vote. And vote no on this election. CHANG: So tell us a little more about Larry Elder and what Elder's final message has been to voters. NIXON: Yeah, Larry Elder has been a fixture of right-wing media in Los Angeles for decades through his syndicated radio show. And like most people running in the recall, he's been telling voters that Newsom really hasn't delivered on issues like homelessness and crime since he became governor almost three years ago. Here's Elder in a video message to his supporters earlier today. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LARRY ELDER: We're going to change California. In fact, we're going to change the world. We're all going to do this together. NIXON: And since jumping into the race, Elder has taken a lot of heat for past comments he has made about women, about workers' rights. He said things like the minimum wage should start at $0 an hour and that employers should not have to provide maternity leave to their employees. CHANG: Well, no matter the outcome of this race, Nicole, a lot of voters have been upset by the recall process in California, like how easy it was to trigger in the first place, how expensive it can be. Has there been any effort to change the approach here? NIXON: Not yet but there's a lot of talk about changing how recalls work in California. The signature threshold to force a recall is fairly low. And it has - if a group has funding to pay for signature drives, it's not all that difficult to get the required signatures. New research out this week from UC Berkeley shows that majorities of voters support changing some of the rules governing recalls here. And top lawmakers in the state legislature said recently that there's appetite there to make some changes too. So lawmakers would have to put this on the ballot, and voters would have final say, so this could be something California voters get to weigh in on as soon as next November. CHANG: We will see.

            "article_content": "The Women's March took place yesterday in Washington DC and other US cities, with a focus on reproductive rights.  LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST: Yesterday, demonstrators gathered in hundreds of cities to protest Texas's restrictive abortion law. The organization Women's March and an array of other groups held rallies for abortion justice marches, and one of them was in downtown Washington, D.C. NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben was there, and she's here to tell us what happened. Good morning. DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN, BYLINE: Hey, Lulu. GARCIA-NAVARRO: You covered a lot of protests and a few women's marches during the Trump years. Was there anything that made this one unique? KURTZLEBEN: Absolutely. And to just explain what it was, there was a rally in downtown D.C. at a place called Freedom Plaza and then a march to the Supreme Court after that. And this was all focused on one issue area, abortion, as opposed to those women's marches which were inspired by Donald Trump and his party and their policies. So this was very focused. And it's important to really drill down on that, I think, because a big theme of this rally was about being unapologetic about fighting for abortion rights. A point that they tried to make to the crowd was do not feel shame or discomfort about this topic. Please talk about it more. And also, I should add that because this was all in response to a policy, that Texas policy, there was a feeling of just an intensely furious reaction to that, in addition, an acknowledgement that the Supreme Court might overturn Roe v. Wade with an upcoming case. So as one woman put it to me, they have just poked a bear, she said. And she added that the bear is big and angry. GARCIA-NAVARRO: All right, big and angry. Was that the mood? KURTZLEBEN: No, not exactly. That's the thing. I asked a lot of people, how are you feeling? Good, bad, scared? And I got a lot of optimism. One person was Lisa Williams from Alexandria, Va., and I asked her how she was feeling as we walked towards the Supreme Court. And here's what she said. LISA WILLIAMS: This is optimism. You know, when I came out today, I was hoping to see more than just a handful of people. There's a ton of people here today, and I understand that they're happening - these rallies are happening all over the country. We all have to take care of the women in Texas and take care of each other. KURTZLEBEN: Now, of course, a big function of protests is to foster that feeling and that feeling of solidarity. And now the question is, OK, where do people put that energy, and what might it do? GARCIA-NAVARRO: I mean, what more do abortion advocates have planned with that energy? KURTZLEBEN: That's a great question. I asked a lot of abortion rights advocates that this week, and some of what they're up to is just immediate support for women and abortion patients in Texas - so giving money to abortion funds, helping patients there go out of state if they so choose. Also, abortion rights advocates are just playing defense. They're trying to prevent new laws in other states from passing, and they're looking ahead to future elections. But one thing I also want to focus on is a rhetorical strategy that there was a lot of yesterday about destigmatizing abortion, about, again, being open if you have had one and being unashamed about it. So here is a clip from a speech given by Kenya Martin from the National Network of Abortion Funds. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KENYA MARTIN: And it's OK to have abortions after some hot sex simply because you don't want to be pregnant. I just didn't want to be pregnant, and I want you to know that if that's your experience, that's OK, too. Your story deserves to be heard. KURTZLEBEN: So the rhetoric has gone a long way from that safe, legal and rare refrain that became popular in the '90s... GARCIA-NAVARRO: A long way. KURTZLEBEN: Yes, absolutely. And this is part of the political strategy that abortion rights advocates are using. A common sign at the march was, someone I love has had an abortion. That's what it said. And the idea is to say, look. Abortion is a common health care procedure, and you probably know someone who had it. So that is one thing they're trying to push. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Let me ask you this, Danielle. You know, you're saying there that the rhetoric of the abortion rights movement has changed. And we heard it. But is the movement as a whole changing with it? KURTZLEBEN: Yes. And, I mean, you could really say that the feminist movement in general, I suppose, more pointedly, white and cisgender feminists, have grown more thoughtful about diversity and more consciously intersectional. And race came up a lot yesterday. Here's Yabsera Faris from Atlanta, Ga. She's with a group called Black Feminist Future. YABSERA FARIS: We're talking about, like, anti-Blackness as a whole, and so you could see, like, a clear connection between police killings and murders with people not having autonomy over their body. KURTZLEBEN: And so if you're talking about how abortion affects different groups of people, then you're also saying it intersects with different issue areas, which, again, is a big part of the politics of this. GARCIA-NAVARRO: All right. That's NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben. Thank you so much. KURTZLEBEN: Of course. Copyright \u00a9 2021 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "California's governor survives a recall election. A new book details concerns during the final days of the Trump administration. And, health care workers' burnout could be affecting patient care.  NOEL KING, HOST: California's governor, Gavin Newsom, will keep his job. AMART\u00cdNEZ, HOST: Newsom fended off a Republican-led recall effort. The Associated Press called the race not long after polls closed. KING: Nicole Nixon with CapRadio News in Sacramento has been following this one. Hey, Nicole. NICOLE NIXON, BYLINE: Hi. KING: So unofficial returns show that about two-thirds of voters in the state chose to keep Newsom in office. What is he saying? NIXON: Yeah, the governor said he was humbled by the results, and he said that by rejecting the recall, he believes Californians were also saying yes to the coronavirus vaccine, to voting rights and all these other issues that came up in this election. Here he is addressing reporters last night. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) GAVIN NEWSOM: We said yes to all those things that we hold dear as Californians and, I would argue, as Americans - economic justice, social justice, racial justice, environmental justice, our values where California's made so much progress. All of those things were on the ballot. NIXON: But the governor said he was still concerned with claims by former President Donald Trump and the leading Republican candidate to replace him that the election would be rigged, and he's concerned that these unsubstantiated claims of election fraud are still coming up. KING: This leading candidate to replace him is a conservative radio host, Larry Elder. What is Larry Elder saying this morning? NIXON: Elder did not commit to accepting the election results previously, but he did do that last night. He conceded the race. KING: OK. NIXON: He told his supporters that they should be gracious in defeat, but some of those supporters didn't really like that. Here's an exchange from his campaign last night in Southern California. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LARRY ELDER: We may have lost the battle, but we are going to win the war. (CHEERING) NIXON: And Newsom is up for reelection next year, and Elder left the door open for another run for governor in 2022. KING: Nicole, given that this doesn't even seem like it was a particularly close race, can you remind us how this recall effort started and why? NIXON: Right. This recall was filed in early 2020, before the pandemic, but it quickly became about the pandemic. Newsom's critics didn't like his tough business restrictions. He took a lot of heat because most schools were closed for a full year, and Republicans tried to make this recall a referendum on Gavin Newsom. But Gavin Newsom tried to make it a referendum on Trumpism. He tied it to national fights over reproductive rights and voting rights, and he was able to bring in support from President Joe Biden and other national Democrats to help boost that message. And you know, you're right. Democratic voters outnumber Republicans 2-to-1 in California, and the early results from this recall reflect that. So there aren't too many surprises from this election. KING: Do you think Newsom will run again in 2022? NIXON: He didn't look that far ahead in his victory speech last night, but his Democratic allies say that this margin puts him in a very strong position going up - into 2022 when he would run again. KING: Nicole Nixon of CapRadio in Sacramento. Thank you, Nicole. NIXON: Thanks. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) KING: The U.S. will not attack China. MART\u00cdNEZ: General Mark Milley told his Chinese counterpart this twice in the last days of the Trump presidency. \"Peril,\" a new book by journalist Bob Woodward and Robert Costa of The Washington Post, details these two calls. Milley made one of them four days before the 2020 election and reportedly made the second one days after the January 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. KING: Now, the book is not out until next week, but Washington Post national political reporter Isaac Stanley-Becker has read it. Good morning, Isaac. ISAAC STANLEY-BECKER: Good morning. KING: So this is a big deal. China is a leading U.S. adversary. Why would General Milley have made these calls saying we're not going to attack you? STANLEY-BECKER: Well, even adversaries share certain interests. And, you know, one of them is preventing nuclear annihilation. And the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Mark Milley, had reviewed intelligence suggesting that the Chinese believed the U.S. was preparing to attack at that time. And he feared a hair-trigger situation in which there could be miscalculation or a preemptive strike by China in an attempt to fend this off or get ahead of it. And at the time, there were tensions over military exercises in the South China Sea. These tensions were deepened by Trump's belligerent rhetoric toward China on the campaign trail. So he tried to assuage these fears. But you mentioned the first call just before the election, the second two days after January 6. The Chinese general wasn't so easily assuaged. And even though Milley tried to say we're stable; things are steady; we're not going to lash out, it's not clear that that message necessarily had its intended reception. KING: OK. So China is worried about a U.S. nuclear attack. But then, on the U.S. end, Milley - General Milley also takes steps to prevent former President Trump from ordering a nuclear attack. What was going through Milley's mind? STANLEY-BECKER: Milley was concerned about checks in the system and ensuring that there wasn't some sort of improper, illegal or immoral action, as he put it to senior officers. So what he does on January 8 is to summon senior officers to review these procedures and to tell them, the president has the authority to decide on action, but there are other steps, and I also have to be made aware of that decision. So whatever happens, clue me in. And it's this remarkable scene in the book where he goes officer by officer, looks them in the eye and asks them to affirm that they understood his directions. And the authors, Bob Woodward and Robert Costa, write that Milley considered this something like an oath. KING: It is worth noting that Trump nominated Milley, and he became Joint Chiefs chairman in late 2019. So all of this was going down a little more than a year after that. What happened in that short period of time? STANLEY-BECKER: That's right. And it's a critical point. He was chosen by the president in 2018 and confirmed in 2019. And there were some immediate events that set this off, including his belief that Trump had suffered a mental decline after the election. This was a view he shared with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in a phone call on January 8. But there were also some events further back that had led him to believe that he had to ensure that the military wasn't going to be manipulated by this president. And one of those signature events was the walk across Lafayette Square during the protests over the killing of George Floyd when there was that photo op. And Trump brought with him senior members of the military, including Milley. And Milley felt that he had been used for this photo op, and he resolved to not let that happen again. KING: Does the book say what the words mental decline actually mean? STANLEY-BECKER: What the book does is it describes what that belief was based on - based on Milley's having watched scenes of Trump just lashing out at aides, him living in this alternative universe of voter fraud and election-related conspiracy theories. And so it describes how this view was formed. KING: OK. Washington Post political reporter Isaac Stanley-Becker. Thanks for joining us this morning. We appreciate it. STANLEY-BECKER: Thanks so much for having me. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) KING: All right. Consider this fact for a minute - even before the pandemic started, burnout among health care workers was a very big challenge. MART\u00cdNEZ: Now, after treating wave upon wave of COVID-19 patients, burnout is at crisis levels, and many say it could be hurting patient care. KING: NPR health correspondent Yuki Noguchi has been looking into this. Good morning, Yuki. YUKI NOGUCHI, BYLINE: Good morning, Noel. KING: How does burnout present among health care workers? NOGUCHI: Well, you know, it isn't just an overwhelming amount of work - although it's that, too - it's also demoralization and eroded motivation, loss of purpose. Health care workers tell me its effect is palpable, and they see its impact on patients. Matthew Crecelius really brought that home for me. He's a traveling intensive care nurse, and he's been handling double or triple the usual number of patients and under tougher circumstances. You know, COVID protocols mean industrial fans are blowing, patients are separated and isolated, and so he can't always see or even hear his patients. MATTHEW CRECELIUS: When you shout out to somebody - hey, can you check on my other people? - like, I can't even see a monitor. I don't know how they're doing. NOGUCHI: Crecelius says he's lost patients who crash while he's tending to other patients. KING: Which would suggest to me that staffing shortages are a problem. NOGUCHI: Oh, that's a huge factor. I mean, people are quitting. Retirement is accelerating. So of course, the people who remain get burnt out even faster. And again, that ripples to patients. Lindsay Moore-Ostby is a primary care doctor in Indianapolis. Every critical care bed in her region is full. One doctor she knows recently called 42 hospitals hoping to transfer a patient, which happens pretty often. So then that doctor complains to her. LINDSAY MOORE-OSTBY: Now I'm spending time trying to make this transfer happen. So what if I can't provide the care I need to the other patient who needs me? It's really a game of dominoes where the doctor is just emotionally devastated because they can't fix it. NOGUCHI: And it's frustrating because many patients have COVID and they didn't get vaccinated. KING: Yes. How much does that frustration over people not getting vaccinated contribute to burnout in this field? NOGUCHI: You know, a lot because much of today's workload is preventable. Matthew Crecelius, that traveling nurse we heard from earlier, says it's a big reason he plans to switch careers. And he's a fifth-generation nurse. And he's... KING: Wow. NOGUCHI: ...Just had enough. CRECELIUS: Now that there is a vaccine and people aren't getting it, my sense of duty, it's changed for me. Like, no, I'm not interested anymore. NOGUCHI: And so the staffing problem gets worse, Noel. KING: Has anybody tried to measure the effect of this on patient care, on what this actually means for people going into hospitals? NOGUCHI: It's not easy to quantify. You know, plenty of studies show burnout reduces the quality of care, but how much is the bigger question. And it's hard to measure how burnt out a doctor or nurse is or how exactly that affected care. So health care workers say the numbers may never capture the whole picture. There's a woman I talked to who said her father was hospitalized this spring. His doctors were so overwhelmed, she couldn't talk to them. They discontinued his anti-stroke pills, thinking he couldn't swallow them, and then he died of a stroke. So she believes burnout cut her dad's life short. But she also says medicine's a team sport, so you can't pinpoint whose burnout played what role. KING: Yeah, it makes sense. NPR health correspondent Yuki Noguchi. Thank you, Yuki. NOGUCHI: Thank you, Noel. Copyright \u00a9 2021 NPR.  All rights reserved.  Visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.

            "article_content": "President Biden on Thursday is expected to sign two executive actions aimed at expanding access to health insurance and reproductive health care.  RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: Since taking office, President Joe Biden has signed a long list of executive orders to try to fulfill his core campaign promises or at least to signal their priority in his administration. Today, health care is in the spotlight. President Biden is signing two executive actions. One aims to increase access to health insurance through the Affordable Care Act and increase access to Medicaid. The other is a memorandum to expand access to reproductive health. NPR health policy reporter Selena Simmons-Duffin is with us for details. Good morning, Selena. SELENA SIMMONS-DUFFIN, BYLINE: Good morning, Rachel. MARTIN: What can you tell us? Let's start off with the executive order on the ACA. SIMMONS-DUFFIN: So the big news there is that the Biden administration is opening up a special enrollment period on healthcare.gov. That is the federally run health insurance exchange. Starting February 15, Americans will have three months to sign up for a health plan if their state uses healthcare.gov as its Obamacare exchange - most states do. That will be open for three months until mid-May. And that means you don't have to prove you've just lost coverage or had a qualifying life event. You could just go in, choose a plan, get covered. And this is the first time there's been a special enrollment period on the federal exchange during the pandemic. The Trump administration faced pressure to have one in the spring, but it never did. MARTIN: And this executive order addresses Medicaid as well. SIMMONS-DUFFIN: Yeah, that's right. Medicaid has turned out to be key in preventing millions of people who've lost jobs from the coronavirus recession from losing their health coverage as well. That's the health plan for low-income people. And last night, the White House put out this fact sheet about the executive order, and it seems pretty sweeping. It's asking federal agencies to look at any rules or policies that make it harder for people to have access to health insurance, either through ACA exchanges or Medicaid. And that includes the controversial work requirements that the Trump administration encouraged states to take up in the last few years. And there are other ways that Biden has said he would like to shore up the ACA. But this is a significant start in terms of what he can do from the executive branch. MARTIN: OK, so the Medicaid and the ACA access, that's encompassed in one executive action. And then there's this memorandum on reproductive health, right? SIMMONS-DUFFIN: Yeah, that's right. So first of all, this one rescinds the global gag rule or Mexico City policy that bans federal dollars from going to international organizations that provide or refer people for abortions. And this is kind of a yo-yo issue. So Republican presidents reinstate it, Democrats rescind it. Biden is getting rid of it. He's also asking for a review of a Trump policy that prevented organizations that promote or provide abortions here in the U.S. from having access to Title X funding. So Biden wants to get rid of that policy as well. MARTIN: So, I mean, we've talked about this on the show. President Biden, other presidents before him, use executive actions when, frankly, on a lot of these issues, they don't think they can get the support in time in Congress. So when you think about these executive orders, when you think about President Biden and what he said about his agenda, where does health policy fall? SIMMONS-DUFFIN: Yeah, that's right. It's kind of hard to remember that health policy was supposed to be the issue of the 2020 election. That's not exactly how it shook out. MARTIN: Right. SIMMONS-DUFFIN: But, yes, I think that Biden is going to be using executive action. And some health experts that I've talked to have said that Trump gave him a playbook for how to do this. All that Trump did on the issue was through the executive branch. He didn't get a single piece of big health legislation through Congress. So Biden has that model to work from to shape this issue in a totally different way with totally different priorities and values. And also part of what he's doing is getting this on people's radar. There are 26 million uninsured people in this country. It's a pandemic. A lot of people don't know that the Affordable Care Act is still the law. And so I'm expecting to see a big push to try to get people to know that this open enrollment period is coming on February 15. MARTIN: NPR health policy reporter Selena Simmons-Duffin, thank you.

            "article_content": "Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Linda Greenhouse says the new Court has given conservatives less than they'd hoped for, though critical cases on abortion and other issues are still pending.  DAVE DAVIES, HOST: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies, in today for Terry Gross. If politics in the United States seem a little unhinged and dysfunctional these days, the nation's highest court is also at a time of transformation. While a new law in Texas effectively bans abortion and controversies over voting rights loom, the court now has a supermajority of conservative justices. Three of them are picks of Donald Trump, the first president since Nixon to place three justices on the court in one term. Our guest, veteran journalist Linda Greenhouse, is one of the nation's leading analysts of the Supreme Court. She has a new book about the first completed term of the new court, exploring how the justices have handled critical constitutional issues and how the personal dynamics among them have evolved under pandemic restrictions that prevented face-to-face contact for much of the term. She says the first year of the court was not quite the term conservatives had hoped for, nor the term liberals had most feared. But much is yet to come. Linda Greenhouse is a graduate of the Yale Law School. She reported on the Supreme Court for The New York Times for 30 years, winning the Pulitzer Prize for her coverage before retiring from the paper in 2008. She now writes an opinion column for the Times and teaches at the Yale Law School. Her latest book is \"Justice On The Brink: The Death Of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, The Rise Of Amy Coney Barrett, And Twelve Months That Transformed The Supreme Court.\" Well, Linda Greenhouse, welcome back to FRESH AIR. There have been many visits. Good to have you again. LINDA GREENHOUSE: Oh, good to be here. DAVIES: I want to start by talking about the recent arguments on the Texas abortion law, but let's just set a bit of context here. You know, I mentioned in the intro that we have three new conservative justices, and people will remember that they came in some ways in controversial ways. In 2018, the one that was not particularly controversial was when Anthony Kennedy retired and was replaced by Brett Kavanaugh, although the confirmation hearing was controversial. But the other two were controversial. In 2016, in February of Obama's last year in office, Antonin Scalia died, and Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader of the Senate, refused to consider Obama's pick, held that Supreme Court appointment for President Trump, who appointed Neil Gorsuch after he was inaugurated. And then in 2020 - February of 2020, six weeks before the presidential election, Ruth Bader Ginsburg died. And Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader of the Senate, insisted on filling that vacancy quickly. Trump appointed and the Senate confirmed Amy Coney Barrett to that post. And I want to begin by talking just a bit about her because her background is particularly relevant to this discussion of the abortion case. You know, she didn't spend a lot of time on - as a judge. She spent a lot of her career in academia. But there was a - some public record of her views on abortion. What do they tell us? GREENHOUSE: Yes, they were not - it was not a judicial record. But as a Notre Dame law professor, she has signed a couple of statements that denounced Roe against Wade. She has signed a statement of protest when the University of Notre Dame gave a special award to then-Vice President Joe Biden because - the statement said, you know, he wasn't a good Catholic because he supported the right to abortion. So her personal views - there's no secret at all about her personal views. And of course, the question remains as to what role those views have in informing her constitutional jurisprudence when it comes to reproductive rights. And we'll soon see. DAVIES: Now, the Texas law essentially bans abortions when a heartbeat is detectable, which effectively kind of means that most women are not in a position to get an abortion before then. But the enforcement mechanism is particularly odd. It allows private citizens to sue anyone involved in securing an abortion and collect $10,000 plus legal costs from the one who broke the law. This is a particular problem for the justices, and when they heard the case in recent days, many of them, including Amy Coney Barrett, expressed some concern. What was going on here? GREENHOUSE: Well, this is an astonishing law. I mean, there's so much wrong with it. It's like, where to begin? But the more immediate background is that on September 1, as the law was about to go into effect, basically shutting down access to abortion in the second-most populous state in the country, the court was asked urgently by abortion clinics, by abortion providers in the state to put the law on hold to enable them to file a full ordinary appeal. And the court refused to do that. It takes five votes to grant a stay, and there were only four votes. And so the law went into effect, and it's been in effect for more than two months. And it was pretty clear that there's a majority of the court that at least has been rendered uncomfortable by - I think, by the conjunction of the court having made a mistake on September 1 - let's just say it - and allow this law to come into effect without Supreme Court review and the nature of the law itself, the vigilante enabling. DAVIES: The court recently heard oral arguments on this Texas law, which effectively bans abortion in the state. Do you want to just explain what this law does and why it's been hard to challenge? GREENHOUSE: The law does two things. As you said, it bans abortion early, early in pregnancy, before most women even know they're pregnant. But the weird thing about this law is that it purports to take the state out of the enforcement business, and it enables any citizen of Texas or anyplace else to file a private civil lawsuit for damages against anybody - not the woman - but anybody who provides or assists in providing the abortion, can sue them for damages. So the challenge for the courts is, who can be sued? Who's the defendant? How do you get a case up to the courts? It's in a way devilishly clever, deeply cynical. And that was the question for the Supreme Court in the argument earlier this month. DAVIES: There was one petition by the Biden administration, the solicitor general, but another one by abortion providers saying, you have to give us access to the judicial system to challenge this. How did the justices react? GREENHOUSE: Whether anybody eventually can challenge the law was the question the court heard earlier this month. And certainly, you could count a majority of the justices who at least were concerned by the notion that a state could wall off, could insulate itself from judicial challenge, flagrantly violating a clear Supreme Court precedent. We still have a right to abortion as of now. So the court was concerned by the implications of this law. What they're actually going to do about it or about the right to abortion itself, we'll see pretty soon. DAVIES: Right. And among those questioning that practice was Amy Coney Barrett and Brett Kavanaugh, two of the Trump appointees, right? GREENHOUSE: Yes. Two of the recent Trump appointees, Justice Barrett and Justice Kavanaugh, seemed concerned about the law. Justice Kavanaugh, in particular, was concerned about the implications. If a red state can wall off an anti-abortion law from challenge, how about a blue state walling off an anti-gun rights law from challenge. That seemed to really get his attention, and, you know, that may be a winning argument for those who say that the courts have to be able to get their hands on a law like this. DAVIES: So there is the prospect that the court could decide that the abortion providers have a right to bring suit in federal court. Now, if they do that, I mean, the typical path to the Supreme Court is you have a trial in a district court, which can take quite a bit of time and then either side can appeal to one of the circuit courts. And then after that, someone can appeal that decision to the Supreme Court. That takes a long time, right? I mean, the question would be, will the Supreme Court stay the implementation of this law, in effect put off implementation until that is resolved? What's your take on that given what they did in September? GREENHOUSE: Well, in late October, when the court agreed to hear these two cases, the federal case and the provider's case, and put them on this extremely fast track with argument in 10 days, the court could have issued a stay, but they didn't. So the law has remained in effect, and I think that signals that the law is going to remain in effect until the process that you just outlined goes through to completion. So we'll see if by the end of that process there still is such a thing as a right to abortion because, at a certain point, these two questions are going to come together - who can sue and who can actually get an abortion in the United States? So, you know, we will see the answers to both those questions, probably by the end of this - the current term. DAVIES: You know, I think you said a moment ago that the court clearly made a mistake in September when it declined to stay implementation of the Texas law. What did you mean? GREENHOUSE: I think there was quite a public outpouring of dismay and surprise about that. The public approval rating of the court, as noted by various polls, by the end of the summer was running about 50%, which is, you know, basically what it's been the last few years. And after September 1, it plummeted to 40%. Now, that's not to suggest that the court should be guided by public opinion. That's not really my point. But I think it reveals that the public, which, you know, doesn't usually pay all that much attention to the Supreme Court - you know, the Supreme Court looks pretty obscure and under the radar much of the time - this got people's attention. And when I say mistake, I meant mistake from the point of - well, I think it was wrong. I think it was morally wrong personally. But my other point is that I think it institutionally damaged the Supreme Court to just - without having undertaken any kind of formal review, argument, full briefing, just allowed this atrocity of a law to take effect in the great state of Texas. DAVIES: We are speaking with Linda Greenhouse. She's a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and veteran analyst of the U.S. Supreme Court. Her new book is \"Justice On The Brink: The Death Of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, The Rise Of Amy Coney Barrett, And 12 Months That Transformed The Supreme Court.\" We'll continue our conversation in just a moment. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF SLOWBERN'S \"WHEN WAR WAS KING\") DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR, and we're speaking with Linda Greenhouse. She is a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and analyst of the U.S. Supreme Court. Her new book is \"Justice On The Brink: The Death Of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, The Rise Of Amy Coney Barrett, And 12 Months That Transformed The Supreme Court.\" So the other challenge that's going to become before the court in December is a Mississippi law which directly restricts abortions, bans them completely after 15 weeks, which would seem to run exactly against the established court rulings that women are entitled to terminate a pregnancy before viability, which is typically - what? - 23 weeks or so. What's the argument for overturning Roe directly? What's the case that they make? GREENHOUSE: Well, they have two kind of arguments. One is we're passing this law for the welfare of women, which, of course, is a very bizarre argument for the state of Mississippi to make because if you look at any list of the welfare of women in pregnancy and childbirth, you know, how do they do, health indications, Mississippi is way at the bottom of every list. And so if Mississippi is concerned about the welfare of pregnant women, it has a very strange way of showing that. But it also makes - the state also makes the argument that, well, when the court decided Roe versus Wade in 1973, you know, women were having a hard time in the economy, in the workplace and balancing, you know, motherhood and work life and so on. But things have changed, and now everything is great. And half the students in law schools are women, and women are here, there and everywhere. And so the court should take account of changing conditions on the ground, which, of course, makes no sense when you're talking about a constitutional right. DAVIES: And how does restricting abortions accommodate these change in circumstances? I mean, I know - and this is not your argument, but what is it? GREENHOUSE: I actually have a hard time articulating the argument. I've read the briefs and, you know, basically the argument comes down to, well, that was then and this is now. And that was a court in 1973, and this is a very different court in 2021. And of course, what people don't remember - and I'll just use this occasion to mention this counterintuitive fact. If you ask the average person who kind of follows the court, what do you think the vote was in Roe versus Wade, and they'll say 5-4, actually, it was 7-2. And Richard Nixon, as you said at the top of this show, had four appointees to the court early in his tenure in the White House. And three of those were in the majority in Roe v. Wade. It was not - the notion of the right to abortion was not a politically polarizing issue in those days. It became polarized later, when the Republican Party did a very good job of kind of achieving a political realignment by using abortion as the sort of dog whistle that - it had successfully used race earlier in Nixon's rise. So, you know, Mississippi is counting on the fact that there has been a political realignment. And the state of Mississippi thinks it's on the right side of history now. DAVIES: You know, you note that John Roberts, the chief justice, is - has been a disappointment to some conservatives. He's, you know, not gone their way in some important cases, like the Affordable Care Act and, you know, immigrant children born in the United States. And he's tended to rule often on narrow grounds rather than making sweeping changes in precedent. But there are two issues you say that he's really had - played the long game on that are very important to him. You want to explain those two issues? GREENHOUSE: Well, one is race, and the other one is religion. So we remember that back in 2013, he was the author of the Shelby County case, which cut the heart out of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. There was another Voting Rights Act case involving a different section of the law this past term, this past July. And the majority kind of did the same thing with that section. So that's a long game for the chief justice. He didn't like the Voting Rights Act for his entire judicial career. He finished a clerkship with an associate justice, William Rehnquist, went to work in the Reagan Justice Department, the Reagan White House. And he wrote lots of memos opposing the effort that was then in Congress that eventually succeeded in reenacting the Voting Rights Act, amending the Voting Rights Act. So this has been part of a long game for John Roberts. The other is religion. John Roberts has had a long-running project to increase the space for religion in the public square. He's been very strategic about it, particularly in cases that involve channeling federal money to parents and - who send their children to parochial schools, to the schools themselves. That will come to fruition, I believe, in the current term. There's a new case on that that's going to build on majority opinions by Chief Justice Roberts over the last few years. So in those two areas, race and religion, he's been very successful. DAVIES: Right. And it seems that his kind of authority or control over the court is strikingly diminished over the past year. Is that fair? GREENHOUSE: In the last term, we saw something quite remarkable. So when Justice Ginsburg was still alive in the spring and early summer of 2020, the pandemic was raging. A number of jurisdictions - state, local - put in capacity control measures for all kinds of public spaces and gathering spaces, shopping malls, stadiums and houses of worship. And so churches started suing over these restrictions, saying limitations on the number of people who can gather in our buildings for worship violate the constitutional right to the free exercise of religion. The court turned down these early challenges from California, from Nevada by votes of 5-4, with the chief justice in the majority with the four more liberal justices joining him and the four more conservative justices in dissent. Then Ruth Ginsburg died. Amy Barrett came, took her seat. And the court flipped. The court started striking down these restrictions. When it came to a balance of public health versus the free exercise claim, the free exercise claim won. And it left the chief justice in dissent. That was a remarkable switch. It really was just a head-spinning development in the last term, the term that I'm writing about. And it certainly raised the question of whether John Roberts, having had such success in the first 15 years of his tenure as chief justice, was about to lose the ability to shape the course of events in the court, which, as I said, has his name on the door. DAVIES: We need to take another break here. Let me reintroduce you. We're speaking with Linda Greenhouse. She is a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and a veteran analyst of the U.S. Supreme Court. She covered it for The New York Times for 30 years. Her new book is \"Justice On The Brink: The Death Of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, The Rise Of Amy Coney Barrett, And Twelve Months That Transformed The Supreme Court.\" We'll be back to talk more after a short break. I'm Dave Davies, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF HERLIN RILEY'S \"RUSH HOUR\") DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies in for Terry Gross. We're speaking with veteran U.S. Supreme Court reporter Linda Greenhouse. She has a new book chronicling the first term of the Supreme Court since three conservative justices appointed by Donald Trump joined the court, giving it a distinctly rightward tilt. Her new book is \"Justice On The Brink: The Death Of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, The Rise Of Amy Coney Barrett, And Twelve Months That Transformed The Supreme Court.\" You know, apart from analyzing the cases in this book, you write about the dynamics of the court. You know, so much of what happens in the court comes in the personal interactions among the justices. And you know, you have new members of the court, and it's - this is a court during this period that, like every other institution, was hampered by pandemic restrictions. How did they communicate, and how did that change their deliberations? GREENHOUSE: Like every other institution, the court shut its doors in March of 2020, postponed arguments. When it got back to arguing later in the spring, the justices heard the arguments over their home telephone lines, not even Zoom like the rest of us. And they never saw each other. You know, I never like to pretend to know more than I know, so I don't actually know the extent to which they might have called each other. But they didn't actually see each other as a group again until Justice Ginsburg's casket was lying in state in the Great Hall of the Supreme Court the following September. And they didn't see each other again until President Biden's inauguration in January of this year when they gathered. DAVIES: Three of them were missing then. Yeah, right. GREENHOUSE: Yeah. A couple of them, for health reasons, didn't come to Washington. So this is a court where they see each other every day that they're on the bench, which is three days out of two weeks out of every month from October through April. They have private, closed-door conferences twice a week. You know, even if they don't hang out socially or go to the movies together or whatever, they have face time for hours every week that the court's in session. And it's almost hard to think of the drastic change that occurred when everything shut down. DAVIES: Yeah. It's like people getting to know each other over social media almost. I mean, you just - it's not like - it's easier to insult someone in writing, isn't it? Yeah. GREENHOUSE: Well, yes. I mean, there was a lot of tension that was expressed in the early election cases, the cases that came up on the emergency shadow docket actually before Election Day that were challenges to COVID accommodations that a number of states had made, increasing mail-in ballots or extending the time by which ballots could be counted, that sort of thing. And there was a lot of what you might say, kind of sniping. And you had to wonder if they actually had been facing each other around the conference table, they might have kind of worked that out a little more. You know, it's hard to draw a straight line. You know, because they weren't meeting in person, then this happened. I don't think it changed anything of the substantive, bottom-line results. But it just had to have been a very, very strange experience. DAVIES: You mentioned the shadow docket. You want to explain what that is and if its use has grown with this court. GREENHOUSE: So the shadow docket is a kind of a - you know, a catchy name for the emergency docket of cases that come up that request the court's immediate intervention without time for setting a case for argument and hearing it and getting briefs and so on and so on. And there's always been an emergency docket because things come up. And the court would attend to it without much controversy. What's different now - what's emerged in the last couple of years is that actual law is being made in the shadow docket. The case I described about the meeting in a home for worship or for any other activity, the court made substantial First Amendment free exercise law in the course of deciding that case without ever having formally granted the case and sort of invited the public in for the argument. I say invited the public in - of course, obviously, only a few hundred people can get into the Supreme Court. But the court puts up the transcript of the argument on its website, puts up the audio of the argument, puts all the briefs up on its website so that somebody who's interested in following the court will find perhaps a surprising amount of transparency on cases that the court agrees to hear. The shadow docket cases, the court has never agreed to hear them. They just go ahead and decide them, and it's become increasingly problematic, the extent to which they're making law in these cases. DAVIES: Yeah. You know, I typically think of emergency actions by a court - that - as coming in circumstances where there's an immediate need to either stop some - and join some activity or not doing it. And you typically, there would be an order, you know, an emergency injunction. But the understanding is this is to hold things in place until the merits of the case are decided. In a case like the case of religious activity in homes during COVID, are you saying that they would issue a ruling which would have lasting precedential effect without ever explaining the legal logic? GREENHOUSE: Yes. That case has been cited subsequently by lower courts, and I'm sure it will be cited by the Supreme Court. It does - these cases do stand as precedents. In many of them, there is some kind of explanation. In some, there's no explanation. But it's not the kind of full decision-making apparatus that would occur if the case was fully - formally granted and fully argued. DAVIES: Right. And I gather the public record that it comes with a fully considered decision is helpful to, you know, courts and attorneys general around the country who want to understand the court's thinking. Do you have an explanation for why there's more use of the shadow docket now? GREENHOUSE: Well, during the Trump years, the Trump administration was very strategic in bringing requests to the court for assistance in overcoming adverse decisions that had been issued by the lower courts - for instance, on  the border wall case where the Trump administration simply helped itself to unappropriated money and put it to the use of building the border wall. And a federal appeals court in California said, absolutely not. You can't do that. Trump administration came to the Supreme Court and said, we need your emergency intervention because the fiscal year is about to run out. And unless we can keep building the wall, we'll have to stop. And the court granted that application off the shadow docket. So, you know, there was a kind of a change, a change in receptivity on behalf of the court to the claims that the Trump administration brought to them. And that has kind of, I think, entered the court's DNA, and so it's still going on. DAVIES: You know, it's interesting. I guess the Trump appointees were willing to grant that request to the Trump administration on the election cases, particularly the election cases alleging fraud and theft of votes. The court pretty much shut those down quickly with the Trump appointees agreeing with the majority. What can you say about the extent to which these three appointees were willing to, you know, go by the president's wishes? GREENHOUSE: Well, what I say in the book is that they assisted in saving the court. And what I meant by that was had the court granted any of these Trump election cases, it would have been an institutional disaster, not only for the country because, obviously, there was no fraud in the election and, obviously, Trump was not robbed of an election victory. That's clear. We can agree on that. But for the court to have given in to the series of requests that came, including that crazy case that Texas brought against the states that Texas claimed should have gone for Trump but didn't - you know, it just would have been an institutional disaster for the Supreme Court. And obviously, the court was well aware of that. DAVIES: We need to take another break here. Let me reintroduce you. We are speaking with Linda Greenhouse. She is a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and analyst of the U.S. Supreme Court. Her new book is \"Justice On The Brink: The Death Of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, The Rise Of Amy Coney Barrett, And Twelve Months That Transformed The Supreme Court.\" We'll continue our conversation after this short break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF ROBBEN FORD AND BILL EVANS' \"CATCH A RIDE\") DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. And we're speaking with Linda Greenhouse. She is a veteran reporter on the Supreme Court, covered it for 30 years for The New York Times. She has a new book chronicling the first term of the Supreme Court since three conservative justices were appointed by Donald Trump. The book is \"Justice On The Brink: The Death Of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, The Rise Of Amy Coney Barrett, And Twelve Months That Transformed The Supreme Court.\" You know, one of the things that happened during the period that you wrote about, this court term from, I guess, October 2020 to September 2021, was - at the end of the Trump administration, there was an effort to expedite the execution of prisoners serving death sentences in federal prisons as opposed to state prisons. Just to set some context here, how unusual was this, for this rush to execute federal prisoners? GREENHOUSE: This was very unusual and very disturbing. So in the summer of 2020, looking ahead to the election, Attorney General Barr announced that the administration would undertake a series of executions of prisoners on the federal death row. There's one federal death row prison. It's in Indiana. The federal government had not executed anybody for 17 years. In the seven months from July of 2020 until four days before President Biden's inauguration in January of this year, the Trump administration executed 13 inmates. All of these came up to the court with some kind of emergency application, either the prisoners saying grant a stay or the Trump administration saying a lower court has granted a stay; we ask you to vacate the stay. And in every case, the court, on the shadow docket, gave the administration what it wanted - either denying a stay or vacating a stay that a lower court had granted. It was really an amazing sequence of events. DAVIES: You know, you write about a dissent - I think it was by Sonia Sotomayor - do I have this right? - in which she argued that the rush to judgment in these cases that really involved careful consideration of some of these petitions really denied defendants justice. GREENHOUSE: She used a phrase that I think is going to stand for this series of executions. She called it an expedited spree of executions. What a well-chosen word - spree. I mean, there was an execution four days before the end of the Trump administration, of a losing president. You know, it was, as I say, a disturbing sequence of events in which the court - history will not be kind to the court's response to this politically driven execution spree. DAVIES: And these were typically done on shadow docket deliberation so that we don't really - the court's logic was not explained? GREENHOUSE: Yes. Typically, these had no explanatory rulings from the majority. There were a number of dissents. Many of them by Justice Sotomayor, some of them joined by Justice Kagan, by Justice Breyer. But the majority didn't actually seem to have very much to say about it. DAVIES: You know, as you're looking at this one year that you chronicled in your book, you draw an analogy to actors in a play. There's this notion that there's a fourth wall which separates them from the audience, which is the kind of understanding that what's happening on stage, you kind of accept it as real, and the players on stage don't acknowledge that there's actually an audience here. You said that this term of the court was one in which the fourth wall was broken. Can you explain what you mean? GREENHOUSE: Yes. What I meant by that was, because of the sequence of events that had brought the court to this point with - especially with Amy Barrett's very rushed nomination and confirmation, we kind of saw the politics hole. It was very hard to maintain the fiction that we maintain when we're sitting in a theater watching a play, that, you know, we see no politics here. It's all law. That was broken not - I don't blame Amy Barrett for it. She was the vehicle of what happened during that astonishing year. But I think the court inevitably paid a price for it. And I think we as spectators, as consumers, as citizens, have to inevitably have adjusted our view of the Supreme Court accordingly. DAVIES: You know, I hate to ask you to predict the future, but, you know, people are really concerned about what's coming from this court with these three new justices. And there have been cases in the past where conservative justices appointed by Republican presidents proved a disappointment to conservatives that, once on the court, tended to be more moderate than many expected. What are we going to see from this court, do you think? GREENHOUSE: I think the cases in which justices have changed, have disappointed the presidents who appointed them, those are in our past, actually. Those were justices who were not vetted the way nominees are today, were not all stamped approved by the Federalist Society the way all of President Trump's judicial nominations, not only on the Supreme Court, have been. I think there are going to be many fewer surprises. So I don't think anybody should hold their breath for thinking that we're going to see another David Souter or another John Paul Stevens, a Republican judge who was nominated by President Gerald Ford back in the days when the Senate didn't even ask him what his views were on abortion. Those days are past. And I think what we see is what we're going to get. DAVIES: One more thing on the politics of judicial nominations and timing of them - this is obviously something that's mattered a lot in recent years. There's been a lot of pressure on Justice Stephen Breyer to retire now while there's a Democratic president and Democratic control of the Senate or, you know, nominal Democratic control of the Senate. What's the impact of all this, do you think? GREENHOUSE: What's the impact on Justice Breyer? DAVIES: Yeah. GREENHOUSE: I actually think it backfired because his motivation is to do whatever he can to not make the court look political. And I think had he retired because liberals are telling him to retire to give President Biden a chance with the, as you said, the very tangential Democratic control of the Senate still obtained would have looked overtly political. And I think it solidified his view that he should just play through. He's at the top of his game. He had a successful term. And I think people who thought that putting up posters around Washington that said Breyer retire was actually going to persuade the man to retire were just - that was a pipe dream. DAVIES: Well, Linda Greenhouse, thank you so much for speaking with us again. GREENHOUSE: My pleasure. Thanks for having me.

McCarthy is poised to run for speaker if the GOP takes control of the House of Representatives.\n                \n                    \n                    Win McNamee/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., continues to make President Biden's handling of the economy the central theme in the runup to the 2022 midterms. McCarthy is poised to run for speaker if the GOP takes control of the House of Representatives. For now Republicans' 2022 midterm election message could be summed up by an old slogan used in the 1990s by Democrats: \"It's the economy, stupid.\" GOP lawmakers in recent weeks have piled on the Biden administration for the chaotic and deadly withdrawal from Afghanistan, and argued it has failed to respond sufficiently to the continuing pandemic the president had vowed to get under control. But with 14 months before the election, Republican lawmakers, campaign operatives and candidates said the leading issue is Biden's economy. While the U.S. economy is growing at a strong clip, prices are increasing at nearly their highest level in years. President Biden, of course, isn't on the ballot, but off-year elections are about sending a message to the party in power. And Republicans think polls showing that a majority of Americans now don't approve of Biden's handling of the economy will stick. For his part, the president is keeping the issue front and center. \"When I came to office, our first job was to stop the economic bleeding, and it was the worst bleeding since Roosevelt [in the Great Depression]. We passed the American Rescue Plan.  That delivered shots in arms and checks in pockets, and provided that extra breathing room for working families,\" Biden said at a recent event at the White House. Those policies enacted in the first months of his term were popular and helped Biden attain high approval ratings through the early summer. But since then his poll numbers have dropped. The president, vice president and top administration officials continue to tout the billions in federal aid for businesses and families that has gone out the door already, but it's unclear voters are giving them a lot of credit for it. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., is confident that Biden \u2014 and voters' assessment of him \u2014 will be the top factor next fall. When asked on Fox News Radio recently about a state poll showing a possible New Hampshire GOP candidate, Chris Sununu, polling above the Democratic incumbent, Sen. Maggie Hassan, McConnell waved it off and instead pivoted to Biden. \"We all know that next year will be a referendum on how you feel about this administration,\" he said. \"Presidential approval is the coin of the realm in these off-year elections two years into a new administration.\" GOP campaign operatives told NPR that the political environment is already intense and enthusiasm from their base is high, even more than a year before voting. The party out of power is traditionally favored to pick up seats in a midterm election. But the razor-thin Democratic majority in the House and the 50-50 Senate make retaking control of at least one chamber be viewed as more than likely. Republicans are arguing that inflation and rising prices for things such as gas and groceries are a result of the nearly $2 trillion coronavirus relief bill that passed in March, largely along party lines. While some GOP lawmakers support a $1 trillion infrastructure measure, they said Democrats' move to link that to a massive multitrillion-dollar spending package that includes money for new federal programs goes too far. \"I think it is difficult for Democrats to talk about specific accomplishments on infrastructure when they can't get that through unless they also do trillions in spending that has nothing to do with infrastructure,\" Dan Conston, president of the Congressional Leadership Fund, the super PAC aligned with House Republicans, told NPR. At a town hall last week in Iowa, Republican freshman Rep. Ashley Hinson spoke about national security issues but also brought up the Democrats' plan to push through a $3.5 trillion package. \"What we're seeing happen right now, the spending spigot has been turned on,\" Hinson said. Republicans said the Democrats' spending plan, which includes expanded health care, universal pre-K, climate programs and a broad array of federal safety net programs, would make inflation worse. Rep. Kevin Brady of Texas, the top Republican on the House panel that began drafting the plan last week, railed on what he said it would do to the economy. Brady said House Democrats were \"ramming through trillions in wasteful spending and crippling tax hikes that will drive prices up even higher, kill millions of American jobs and usher in a new era of government dependency with the greatest expansion of the welfare state in our lifetime.\" Biden has said that the current stretch of high prices is transitory and that his broad spending programs would reduce inflation. Conston noted that voters tend not to like it when one party controls both the White House and Congress. He said some voting blocs Republicans struggled with in 2020 are in play. \"Now that the country is governed by one party, that party has made a decided shift left,\" he said, \"that is already turning off voters in the middle, independents, suburban voters, college-educated men.\" Campaign strategists in both parties agree domestic policies will be the centerpiece of their message to voters. But the reaction to how the Biden administration handled the U.S. military's exit from Afghanistan is one area where Biden's pitch in the 2020 election as the experienced foreign policy hand could lead to some buyer's remorse. \"He ran as the competence president, and this fundamentally goes at odds with that,\" Conston maintained. Some Democrats on Capitol Hill share concerns about the administration's decision-making on Afghanistan. But they are singularly focused on the legislative agenda that would deliver on campaign promises they made in 2020. They said the policies they are crafting now will directly affect the pocketbooks of middle-class families and will be paid for by changes to the tax code that make the rich pay \"their fair share.\" They believe policies promoting paid family leave, elder care and free community college will make a big difference for American families for years to come. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., frequently talks about the policies being \"about the children.\" At an event touting the \"Build Back Better\" legislation, Pelosi said, \"For our economy, for our society, for our country, what the president is advocating is transformational; it's not incremental, it's transformational.\" An abortion-rights activist holds a sign in support of Planned Parenthood at a rally Saturday at the Texas Capitol in Austin.\n                \n                    \n                    Jordan Vonderhaar/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption While Republicans talk about their base being focused on the economy, Democrats said a new issue could help them energize their voters: abortion. The U.S. Supreme Court's decision not to block a Texas abortion law that bans most procedures after roughly six weeks was a stunning development to abortion-rights groups, and one that Democratic campaign officials said can help to show what's at stake next fall. Tim Persico, executive director of the House Democrats' campaign arm, said in a written statement after the ruling that \"the extremist Republican agenda hurts women.\" He added, \"House Democrats will not back down when it comes to protecting reproductive rights, and we're committed to doing everything in our power to make sure Republicans lose their seats for this in 2022.\" Republican Conston told NPR it's too early to tell about the issue. \"Abortion is a very good base motivating issue for both sides, and it certainly comes with its challenges,\" he said. \"Whether this remains an issue for the next 14 months is really an unknown.\" Another issue that will shape the 2022 midterms is redistricting. It will be months before House candidates know the shape of their districts, and that will likely affect where candidates run and whether some decide to retire. Overall, Republicans hold an advantage in that process, no matter the state of the economy.",

For 27 years, conservative talk radio host Larry Elder has been a provocateur on Los Angeles radio dials: a Black host who leans libertarian and delights in skewering Democratic politicians and liberal orthodoxy. Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom is just his latest target. If the effort to recall Newsom on Tuesday is successful, Elder, a Republican, is the frontrunner to lead this deep blue state. (That scenario is a big \"if\", as recent polls have shown Newsom widening his lead among likely voters to defeat the recall by an average of nearly 15 points.) California's recall rules let a replacement candidate win with just a plurality of votes, while Newsom must convince a majority of voters to choose \"no\" on the recall ballot in order to keep his seat as governor. The same polls show Elder has the support of more than a quarter of likely voters. That's far more than his closest rival, Democrat and financial advice YouTuber Kevin Paffrath, a political newcomer who wants to pipe water to California from the Mississippi River. Elder would be the first Black governor in state history, and he's making a play for voters of color, while Black leaders line up to oppose him. At a recent rally in Thousand Oaks, a city north of Los Angeles, Elder appealed to Black and Latino voters, arguing that Democrats take them for granted. \"You are being betrayed,\" Elder said. \"And what they're afraid of is that Larry Elder, from the 'hood, who went to a public school, will be able to make the case to Black and Brown people: You are being used. You are being manipulated.\" In this case, Elder was talking about charter schools and the power of the California teachers' union, a major Newsom supporter that backed the governor's decision to require masking in public schools and vaccines for school staff. Elder has pledged to repeal such restrictions on his first morning in office. He says Newsom's decision last year to halt in-person education for public schools in counties with high coronavirus infections and hospitalizations was hypocritical, \"ignoring science,\" and damaging to Black and Latino kids the most. But many of California's African American leaders say, not so fast. \"In the Black community, we are very familiar with Larry Elder,\" said Democratic U.S. Rep. Karen Bass. Like Elder, Bass got her start in South Los Angeles. She was an emergency room nurse-turned-community organizer. She now represents much of the area in Congress. In an interview with member station KPCC, Bass said Elder's promise to rescind public health restrictions would put lives at risk. \"The policies that he projects are an absolute threat to the Black community,\" she said. \"When you talk about the COVID-19 rate, the death rate and the infection rate in the Black community, it's a pretty obvious choice.\" \"The community isn't stupid,\" Bass said. \"People understand where their interests are.\" Bass and more than a dozen prominent Black leaders in California partnered with the African American Voter Registration, Education and Participation Project to mobilize Black voters to turn in their recall ballots. Keyva Clark, a volunteer for the African American Voter Registration, Education and Participation Project, scrolls through a list of registered voters to call to encourage them to vote in the Sept. 14 California recall election.\n                \n                    \n                    Libby Denkmann/KPCC\n                    \n                \nhide caption Keyva Clark, a volunteer for the African American Voter Registration, Education and Participation Project, scrolls through a list of registered voters to call to encourage them to vote in the Sept. 14 California recall election. On a recent Saturday afternoon in the Baldwin Village neighborhood in South Los Angeles., volunteer Keyva Clark cranked through a phone bank list. Groups like this one have helped California's electorate become more diverse in recent years, but it's still whiter and more affluent than the state as a whole. Clark said Newsom has been supportive of stricter use-of-force standards for police and environmental policies that she cares about. When asked about Elder, she cites an adage popularized by the author Zora Neale Hurston. \"All skinfolk ain't kinfolk,\" she said. \"He doesn't embody what African American voters really need and want in a governor.\" In his decades as a political contrarian, Elder has heard those criticisms before \u2014 especially from Los Angeles' Black community. His radio show was the subject of a Black-led advertiser boycott in the 1990s. He would face a larger battle as governor, where Democrats hold supermajorities in both chambers of the legislature. Over the decades, Black leaders on the left have largely ignored Elder for not wanting to give his brand of right-wing talk radio any more oxygen. Since the 1990s, he's had a tough time convincing potential guests, such as Rep. Maxine Waters \u2014 a frequent target of his \u2014 to appear on his program. Political consultant Kerman Maddox recalls in the 1990s people often telling him that he and Elder should debate. That was when they were among the few regular African American voices on local PBS programs. Maddox wasn't interested. \"His thinking is so far out of the mainstream, I would tell people, 'Don't pay attention to the guy.' People like that crave attention.\" \"When affirmative action was on the ballot, he was crying 'reverse discrimination,' \" Maddox said. \"Whatever the issues are where the Black community rallies together, he goes out of his way to be on the other side. That's just who Larry Elder is.\" Elder's Los Angeles-based show has been nationally syndicated for years, initially by ABC Radio and later Salem Radio Network, though Elder is not hosting while he's a candidate for Governor. Elected officials, labor leaders and political organizers are no longer looking past \"The Sage from South Central\", as he calls himself. Elder attended Crenshaw High School before heading off to Brown University in the 1970s and then the University of Michigan Law School. Maddox says the stakes of the recall are too high to simply sit back and watch. \"It's OK to be Republican. That doesn't bother me,\" he said. \"What bothers me is Larry gives comfort to the people who are white supremacists, or who don't believe racism exists.\" \"If a guy like this wins in a blue state like California, can you imagine what role he plays nationally in 2022?\" Elder's conservative positions put him at odds with mainstream Black policymakers and civil rights activists. According to Elder systemic racism in policing is \"a lie.\" (It's not a lie. There's a pile of research showing Black people in the U.S. are disproportionately subject to police use of force, including deadly shootings \u2014 even when you consider rates of violent crime committed by Black people.) Elder blames criminal justice reforms Democrats have championed, and progressive talk of defunding the police, for a rise in violent crime \u2014 something cities across the country have seen, in red and blue states. On the radio and on the campaign trail, Elder is fond of saying that Black leaders who call out the ongoing legacy of racist systems are taking on a \"victim\" mindset, and should instead follow the advice of his late father who was a Marine Corps veteran: \"Hard work wins.\" Black Lives Matter-L.A. co-founder Melina Abdullah called Elder \"The Black face of white supremacy\" in an L.A. Times' column. At a campaign event, Elder said that criticism, \"is because I dare to say racism is no longer a major problem in America ... It's what the left does to divide us because they want to scare Black people and guilt-trip white liberals into pulling the lever for them.\" Elder's perspective on racism made headlines for a different reason last week. While campaigning in Venice, Calif., on Wednesday, a woman in a gorilla mask threw an egg at the candidate while he was viewing homeless encampments. The woman later struck a member of his security detail. Videos of the attack went viral online, with some commentators decrying a double standard in how the media covered the event. The Los Angeles Police Department is investigating. Elder said on Fox News that he wasn't sure if the alleged assault was racially motivated, but added \"the left would be screaming about systemic racism,\" if he were a liberal candidate. At a rally and fundraiser in Orange County, Navy veteran Chris McGee said Elder's \"personal responsibility\" message resonates with him. \"They call him 'the Black face of white supremacy' \u2014 is that not an oxymoron?\" McGee said. \"Why are we trying to divide each other? We should be embracing the things that make us different and coming together. I think Larry wants to change that narrative.\" Chris McGee, the Westminster city chair for the Orange County Republican Party, attends an rally and fundraiser for gubernatorial candidate Larry Elder on Aug. 21.\n                \n                    \n                    Libby Denkmann/KPCC\n                    \n                \nhide caption Chris McGee, the Westminster city chair for the Orange County Republican Party, attends an rally and fundraiser for gubernatorial candidate Larry Elder on Aug. 21. McGee is African American and is the Westminster city chair for the Orange County GOP. He argued that Newsom shutting down businesses and churches over COVID-19 was arbitrary and not based on science. \"I know Larry can make a difference,\" McGee said. \"I really don't understand why other African Americans and people of color aren't here today supporting him.\" In speeches and messaging in the final days of the campaign, Newsom is zeroing in on Elder as the strongest recall challenger, warning he would roll back climate change mitigation efforts and appoint conservative judges \u2014 possibly even a Republican U.S. Senator if 88-year old Dianne Feinstein decides to retire before her term ends. Democrats are also tying the recall effort to national issues, such as voting rights and abortion. In the San Francisco Bay Area on Wednesday, Vice President Kamala Harris contrasted the strict abortion law in Texas and comments by Texas Gov. Greg Abbott about rape survivors to Newsom's support of reproductive rights. Elder has given mixed signals on what he would do about access to abortion as governor, but he said he is \"pro-life, 100%.\" The strategy \u2014 along with tens of millions of dollars in anti-recall spending \u2014 appears to be riling up liberal voters. Democrats aren't taking the numbers for granted. They're bringing in more heavy-hitting names to carry Newsom over the finish line. Former President Barack Obama taped a plea for voters to keep the governor in office, which debuted online and on television this week. And President Biden has committed to appearing with Newsom on election eve in Long Beach.",

            "article_content": "White House official tells NPR there's an effort to get rural Americans vaccinated. Florida cancels COVID-19 related rules. Progressives want liberal Supreme Court Justice Breyer to retire.  RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: Today, President Biden plans to announce targeted steps to try and get more people vaccinated. NOEL KING, HOST: Right. About 32% of the U.S. population is fully vaccinated, but it has been going more slowly recently. Rural America is worrying for two reasons. No. 1, access can still be difficult. And No. 2, demand for the vaccine is taking a dive. Yesterday, though, President Biden said things are getting better. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: We have expanded access to vaccinations to familiar places, 40,000 drugstores now, also all of the community health centers that are available all across the nation. Mobile units are going out, and it's getting better and better and better. MARTIN: NPR's White House correspondent Tamara Keith has the details this morning. Tam, thanks for being here. TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Glad to be with you. MARTIN: You've got exclusive information on the president's plan. What's he going to announce? KEITH: Yeah, the White House wants to see more local doctors delivering shots. So the administration is asking states to give more vaccines to doctors offices, especially in vulnerable areas with limited access to health care, like rural communities. And they're also trying to sign up family doctors and pediatricians to give shots, something that an administration official told me will be particularly critical if the Food and Drug Administration gives the OK for adolescents to start getting vaccinated. After all, some of the most influential people in communities are local doctors and nurses and friends and family who work in the health care system. MARTIN: Yeah. So let's talk about the problems, the slow going of the vaccine rollout in rural areas. It's been problematic in parts of the country. KEITH: Yeah, and I got early access to a survey conducted by the National Rural Health Association and a group called Chartis. They reached out to rural hospital executives to get an idea of what share of their own employees are getting vaccinated. And the results have these folks worried - 30% of these executives said less than half of their staff had taken the COVID vaccine. Now, keep in mind, health care workers have been eligible for vaccination for months now since late last year. I spoke with Jeff Tindle, who's a CEO at Carroll County Memorial Hospital in Missouri. His hospital serves a town of about 4,000 people. He said only 59% of his staff are vaccinated at this point, and he really doesn't have much hope of that number growing dramatically. JEFF TINDLE: I made every single decision with the start and the end of those decisions, how can I protect my employees the most? Every decision. And yet, you know, I want them to kind of help meet me halfway and let's protect you and your families and - 59%. MARTIN: I mean, Tam, that's really hard. How can these health care workers encourage other people to get the vaccine when they themselves aren't doing it, right? KEITH: That is the concern. And he's really beside himself. But, you know, there are other hospitals in rural areas that are having a lot of luck. I spoke to folks at Memorial Hospital in Mt. Washington Valley in New Hampshire. They're currently at 78%. Their success they attribute to a local doctor who wrote a letter to everyone on staff that swayed a lot of people early on and a series of Zoom sessions they held for staff led by doctors, where they just left a lot of time to answer questions. MARTIN: So how is the White House going to fix this issue when the health care workers are reticent? KEITH: Yeah, and they know that these doctors are trusted local leaders and they need them for their vaccination plans. Here's Bechara Choucair, the White House vaccinations coordinator. BECHARA CHOUCAIR: Obviously, there are still some pockets and issues around vaccine confidence, and we have to continue to work on that, whether in the health care space or in the general communities overall. KEITH: But generally, he's accentuating the positive because they don't want to create a self-fulfilling prophecy of resistance. He told me polling has found most rural residents do plan to get the shot even if the rates are lower than in urban and suburban areas. MARTIN: NPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith. Thank you, Tam. KEITH: You're welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MARTIN: So Florida is calling it quits on masks and social distancing. KING: Yes. Governor Ron DeSantis signed an order yesterday that canceled COVID-related restrictions for the entire state. Now, that includes individual county and city mandates requiring face masks and rules limiting capacity in public places. Fewer - we should note, fewer than half of Florida's eligible residents are fully vaccinated at this point. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) RON DESANTIS: I think that's the evidence-based thing to do. I think the fact... (APPLAUSE) MARTIN: DeSantis says the Sunshine State is no longer in a state of emergency. NPR's Greg Allen is with us from Miami. Good morning, Greg. GREG ALLEN, BYLINE: Good morning. MARTIN: Not in a state of emergency - so does that mean the pandemic is over in Florida? ALLEN: Well, let's talk about the numbers here. Yesterday, there was more than 3,000 cases again. That's very typical. Cases are still staying high. We had 41 additional deaths. But DeSantis is saying that he believes that because the vaccine is now available to anyone who wants it, there's no reason to keep imposing restrictions on individuals and businesses, you know, and he's not alone. New York, New Jersey and Connecticut all recently announced that they would end most COVID restrictions in two weeks. MARTIN: DeSantis hasn't been a big fan of the COVID restrictions from the beginning. So are there that many rules to roll back? ALLEN: Well, Florida doesn't have a statewide mask mandate, for example, but many cities and counties have had them. They're following CDC guidelines. Many areas were requiring masks to be worn inside or outside in crowds. DeSantis' is new order invalidates all those mask requirements. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DESANTIS: If we have widespread vaccinations that are over 99% effective, what's the evidence basis to force somebody to wear a mask or any of these restrictions? ALLEN: He says the order is just about government regulations and doesn't apply to businesses. But he also has an order that prevents the use of so-called vaccine passports. Under that order, people can't be denied service because they won't share information about whether or not they're vaccinated. And that, of course, has implications for cruise lines, which are still trying to get restarted here. MARTIN: DeSantis is saying you don't need COVID restrictions because the vaccines are out there. Everyone's eligible. But as we noted in the top, I mean, the vaccination rates in Florida still are low, right? ALLEN: Yes. And they seem to be slowing down now as they are nationally. Just over 42% here statewide have received at least one dose. That's behind the national average. Although he encourages everyone to get the vaccine, DeSantis says repeatedly that he believes it's a matter of individual choice and his opposition to vaccine passports sends that message that it's OK not to be vaccinated. MARTIN: So what are local Florida officials saying about the changing of the rules? Because this affects the decisions that cities themselves have made, right? ALLEN: Right. They find themselves on the front lines here, as always, in these kind of situations, and they're angry about it. Miami-Dade's mayor, Daniella Levine Cava, for example, said her area is still in a public health emergency, and there are new variants spreading. DeSantis has said repeatedly that he believes the extended COVID lockdowns and closure of schools were disasters that shouldn't be repeated. He's also now signed a law that allows local officials to impose emergency measures just for a week at a time and for six weeks total. And the governor can override those orders any time going forward. So local officials, many of them are Democrats, are saying that this is hypocritical, a power grab. Republicans have long been champions of local control, of course, and they've long said they believe local officials should decide what's best for the communities. But this turns that principle on its head. Here's St. Petersburg's mayor, Rick Kriseman. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) RICK KRISEMAN: And it's about the state trying to wrestle control and take control away from local government, the people who are closest to the people who elected them to make the decisions about what's best for our community. ALLEN: You know, the battle of preemption, the state taking authority away from local governments, is one we've seen here and many other states around the country. And this law will likely face a court challenge. MARTIN: NPR's Greg Allen reporting from Miami. Greg, thank you. ALLEN: You're welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MARTIN: All right. To the U.S. Supreme Court now, where Justice Stephen Breyer has long been a liberal vote. KING: Yeah. For 30 years, he's voted for things that have also been Democratic priorities, like reproductive rights and LGBTQ rights. But that long tenure, those 30 years, are why some progressives want him to step down. MARTIN: NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben has been talking with some of them, and she joins us this morning. Hey, Danielle. DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN, BYLINE: Hey, Rachel. MARTIN: So Breyer is a liberal justice, and Democrats are calling for his retirement. Can you explain what's going on here? KURTZLEBEN: Sure. Yeah. Well, Justice Breyer has been on the court for nearly 30 years now. He was appointed by Bill Clinton in 1994. And these groups are saying, look, we very much respect you, Justice Breyer. These are some Democrats, some progressive groups saying we like you, we like the way you voted, but also we don't know how long we're going to have the Senate, and Democrats only have the Senate by the narrowest possible majority right now. So they're saying, look, please step down because we want to safeguard particular rights that we believe in. For example, LGBTQ rights, abortion rights, voting rights. Listen, these Democrats have been stung by President Trump's three nominations, one of which was delayed because Senate Republicans wouldn't hold hearings for Merrick Garland back during Obama's presidency. So there's politeness in these calls but also some urgency. MARTIN: OK. So just to say it plainly, he's very old, and they would like President Biden to have a chance to nominate someone who is younger who would have the chance to sit on the court for a long time. KURTZLEBEN: Yes, absolutely. Some of these calls are from progressive interest groups like Women's March. There's another group called Demand Justice, which advocates for Supreme Court reform. They sent a truck driving around the Supreme Court at one point last month with a sign on it that said Breyer retire - a bit of a stunt there. But look, you do have a little bit of talk about this on Capitol Hill. New York Democratic Representative Mondaire Jones openly called for Breyer to retire in an interview last month. And some of these calls are a little more muted. Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal told The Washington Post last month that, as he put it, elections have risks and that he hopes Breyer is, quote, \"aware of that risk and that he sees it accordingly.\" Now, also to be clear here, the White House is staying out of this publicly. Jen Psaki, press secretary, said that President Biden feels it is totally Breyer's choice. MARTIN: These justices can serve for life. They're supposed to be protected from political pressure from outside groups. Do these calls for Breyer to step down even matter? KURTZLEBEN: I mean, that's a great question. I did speak to Neil Eggleston. He was a White House counsel for President Obama. And he said that during his tenure, he considered reaching out to Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg to talk to her about retiring, but he decided not to. Here's what he said. NEIL EGGLESTON: It's a little unseemly for a White House to suggest to a justice that they should retire and that the White House didn't have any information that Justice Ginsburg didn't already have. And so I just decided she would decide what she thought was appropriate. KURTZLEBEN: And so he thinks something similar is probably going on with Breyer, that he's a smart guy, he knows what the political game board looks like. So we're going to be watching for the end of the term in June. MARTIN: NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben. Danielle, thanks. We appreciate you. KURTZLEBEN: Yes, thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2021 NPR.

            "article_content": "Atlantic journalist Bart Gellman says the Republican party is increasingly unwilling to accept defeat and, in fact, is \"prepared to win by sacrificing the essential elements of democracy.\"  TERRY GROSS, HOST: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. In a new article titled \"Trump's Next Coup Has Already Begun,\" published in The Atlantic, my guest, journalist Barton Gellman, warns January 6 was just practice. We face a serious risk that American democracy as we know it will come to an end in 2024. The attempt by Trump and other Republicans to overturn the results of the 2020 election failed. But Gellman reports that Republicans have been building an apparatus for election theft. They've studied Trump's crusade to overturn the 2020 results. They've noted points of failure and have taken steps to avoid failure next time by working to change whose votes are counted, who oversees the election, who chooses the electors and what happens in the courts. Gellman also warns that Republicans have set lose tens of millions of aggrieved Trump supporters who are prone to conspiracy thinking, embrace violence and reject Democratic defeat. He writes Trump has built the first American mass political movement that is ready to fight by any means necessary, including bloodshed, for its cause. Gellman sounded the alarm before the 2020 election in articles titled \"The Election That Could Break America\" and \"How Trump Could Attempt A Coup.\" Barton Gellman is a staff writer at The Atlantic and a former Washington Post reporter. He won the 2014 Pulitzer Prize for Public Service for his coverage of the National Security Agency and Edward Snowden. He's the author of the books \"Dark Mirror: Edward Snowden And The American Surveillance State\" and \"Angler: The Cheney Vice Presidency.\" We recorded our interview yesterday. Barton Gellman, welcome back to FRESH AIR. So, you know, a lot of people have said Trump tried so many different paths to overturn the 2020 election, but there was always someone who refused to go along with it. So democracy works. But you say in nearly every battlespace of the war to control the count of the next election - statehouses, state election authorities, courthouses, Congress and the Republican Party apparatus - Trump's position has improved since a year ago. And Republicans have identified the weak points in the election apparatus and are exploiting them. Is there a master plan or a group of master planners who are overseeing the big picture? Or is this just a lot of people working independently at whatever level they're on? BARTON GELLMAN: It's much more the latter. It's a kind of accumulation of local and state Republican operatives who are on their own initiative driven by the base going after all sources of impediment and dissent that prevented Trump from stealing the last election. So just for example, there's an obscure and otherwise little-known position on the Michigan Board of State Canvassers which is composed of two Republicans and two Democrats. The last time, in 2020, Trump's strategy was to get both Republicans to refuse to certify the state election results, which was required as part of the procedure before electors could be appointed for the state of Michigan, which Biden won. He wanted to deadlock that panel to save time and to give time for the Michigan legislature to take other actions in his favor. There was one Republican on that panel who refused Trump's entreaties to vote against certification. His name was Van Langevelde, you know, a 30-something Republican functionary. But he said the election results are valid. I'm going to vote for them, and he's now been hounded out of office and he's off the board of state canvassers. That's what the Trump allies have done all around the country. They've looked for everywhere that said no to Trump, and they have tried to remove those people, or they have changed the law so those people no longer have any authority to get in Trump's way. GROSS: You write that the strategic object of nearly every move by the Trump team was to get Republican state legislatures in states that Biden won to seize control of the results and appoint Trump electors instead and all of the other objectives in the courts, in the state election panels, the Justice Department, the vice president's office was to reach that goal of substituting Trump electors for Biden electors at the state level. Is that still the strategy? GELLMAN: That's exactly the strategy. Electors are the currency of a presidential election. You have to get to 270, and that's how you win the presidency. And Trump's strategy last time and next time is to take a state that Biden nor the Democratic nominee wins and persuade the Republican legislature to substitute Trump electors for the Biden electors to say based on some excuse or another that the choice of the voters can't be relied upon, that there was fraud or irregularities and the legislature is therefore going to choose who the legislature thinks won. I mean, it's an audacious and outrageous and completely beyond the pale kind of transaction here. It's saying let's fire the voters and decide for them who wins the presidency. It was so audacious that last time around, Trump never managed to persuade any of the legislators acting formally to do this. But the conversation has now been had over and over and over again. It's been normalized since 2020. And there is much more reason to believe that Trump could be successful next time. What it needs is an excuse from something like a board of state canvassers or a judge or a state election authority that's been taken over by a proponent of the big lie and that gives a quasi-legal cover to the legislature to appoint its own electors. GROSS: So what is the legal strategy that would allow Republican-controlled state legislatures to basically overturn the results of the election in that state and appoint Republican electors to the electoral college instead of the Democrat electors that were elected in the state? GELLMAN: It goes back to the days of the founders. In the first years after the Constitution was written in the first elections, under Article 2 of the Constitution, electors for the presidency were selected, as the Constitution says, in the manner of their own choosing, referring to the legislators. So state legislatures were in charge of choosing electors. Now, for more than 150 years, every state has decided that it would choose electors by asking its voters to vote. So we are accustomed to choosing electors by the popular vote in each state. But that's not the way the Constitution required. And so what the legal strategy is is for the state legislators to take back their constitutional authority to directly choose electors. And so they can disregard what their voters choose or they can claim that the voters' choice has been irrevocably tainted by fraud and therefore the legislators can make the choice. And the reason for this strategy is that there are a number of important swing states in a presidential election that went for Biden in 2020 but have all-Republican legislatures at home. And so the Republican legislatures could theoretically override the choice of the voters. And that's exactly what Trump asked them to do last time and will be asking them to do next time. GROSS: So let's look some more at this Republican strategy to potentially overturn the Democratic electors and substitute a slate of Republican ones. What would it take to successfully do that? How do you create a slate of Republican electors that are legitimate if the Democratic electors have won? GELLMAN: So the scenario goes something like this. Take the state of - suppose it's Arizona in 2020. The people vote. Biden wins the state by a narrow margin of - I don't actually remember. It was something on the order of 10,000 votes. The Democratic secretary of state, Katie Hobbs, certifies that Biden has won the vote in the state and therefore that the electors from the state of Arizona shall be Biden electors and those electors will gather on December 14 during the quadrennial meeting of the Electoral College and cast their votes for Biden. Meanwhile, the Republican legislature in Arizona says, we don't trust the count. We have done our own pretend audit, have detected fraud. And we believe that Trump has actually won the vote, that Trump is the victor in Arizona. And we, the legislature, using our powers under Article 2 of the Constitution, hereby appoint Trump electors instead of Biden electors. And so now what happens is that Congress, when it gathers to meet on January 6, is presented with a slate of electors that were signed by the Democratic secretary of state and the governor of Arizona, who did sign the certification in 2020, on the one hand. And then another slate of electors that are duly transmitted by the lawful legislature, House and Senate, by majority vote have appointed Trump electors. And Congress has to sort out which ones count, if either. GROSS: So was Katie Hobbs, the secretary of state in Arizona who you mentioned - was she one of the people who have been pushed out? GELLMAN: No, she hasn't been pushed out. She's been bypassed. The Republican state legislature passed a law that says only until the date of the next election, in case a Republican wins, the secretary of state will have no power to represent the state of Arizona in legal matters pertaining to the election. So they simply took away her power to do what secretary of state does, which is to oversee the election. That's just another example of the way Republicans have gone around methodically either pushing out or defanging every opponent of Trump's big lie. And so for example, Trump, also in Arizona, has denounced the governor, Republican Governor Ducey, who signed the certification of Biden's victory in 2020. And so he's now endorsed a candidate to replace Ducey who has stated that she would not have certified by his victory despite the fact that Biden won and, in effect, is promising to put her thumb on the scale next time as well. GROSS: How close did any state come to overturning a Biden victory in that state in 2020? GELLMAN: There was a crescendo of pressure from Trump in the days leading up to January 6, which is the day that Congress actually counted the electoral votes. And state legislators had been resistant. They were stunned by the request to discard all the votes of their voters. And they wanted to support Trump, but they weren't quite sure what to do. The state of Pennsylvania had its state House and Senate leadership send a letter to Congress saying that Pennsylvania should not have certified the victory for Biden and asked Congress to delay the count of the electors so that Pennsylvania could reconsider. That's the closest any state actually came. But Rudy Giuliani was convinced that if they could have 5 or 10 more days to keep the pressure on the state legislatures that they would be able to flip some of them into at least decertifying their votes so that there would be no certified electoral votes from that state and the election would therefore be thrown to the House of Representatives. GROSS: You know, most people, I think, don't even know who is in their statehouse. And it's so interesting to see how much power state legislatures have when most voters don't even know much about who those legislators are. GELLMAN: Yeah. It's quite frightening in the context of presidential politics because we haven't had to worry about what state legislators thought about the presidential election very much because the voters got to choose their president. If you get into a situation in which the statehouse and the state Senate are going to choose for them, then yeah (laughter). I'm going to want to take considerably more interest in who those people are. GROSS: Well, let's take a break here, and then we'll talk some more. If you're just joining us, my guest is Barton Gellman. His new article in The Atlantic is titled \"Trump's Next Coup Has Already Begun.\" We'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF JOAN JEANRENAUD'S \"AXIS\") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to my interview with Barton Gellman. His new article in The Atlantic is titled \"Trump's Next Coup Has Already Begun.\" Gellman is a staff writer at The Atlantic. You say that Republicans are already preparing court strategies, legal strategies for overturning the results of the 2024 election if a Democrat wins the election. What do you know about what those strategies are? GELLMAN: Well, first of all, just to set the stage, these strategies are fundamentally opportunistic in that they take advantage of the fact that there are closely contested states in the presidential election that are turning Democratic but are represented at home by state legislatures that are dominated by Republicans. And so you have Republican control of the state House and Senate in a state that is beginning to turn towards Democrats in the presidential election. So the legal strategy to take advantage of this is called the Independent State Legislature Doctrine. It's a doctrine only by proposal. And the idea is that because state legislatures under the constitution have the authority to decide how electors are chosen, that any deviation from state law about how elections are to be run - for example, if the state election administration sends out mail ballots because there's a pandemic and invites voters to vote by mail when the state legislature has not explicitly authorized that, then the state legislature may take over the selection of electors because its will is paramount. It's basically a doctrine that allows for the override of selection by voters. It's a way of firing the voters and assigning their votes to the candidate of the Republican legislature's choice. GROSS: Since having a Republican-controlled state legislature is so essential to the strategy for 2024, what is the Republican plan to try to ensure that Republicans control state legislatures in swing states? GELLMAN: The interesting thing about a state legislature is the state legislature also gets to draw the district lines when apportioning votes inside the state. So they are gerrymandering the - not only the U.S. federal congressional districts, but their own state House and Senate districts so that they just about can't lose. So you have lines drawn in such a way that a state that voted for Biden is represented overwhelmingly by Republicans because of the way they drew the district lines. GROSS: We talked a little bit about this, but election officials who served as guardrails when Trump was trying to overturn the results of the election - many of them were just, like, pushed out of the way. And one example of that is Brad Raffensperger, who was Georgia's secretary of state. And he refused to, quote, \"find\" the votes that Trump said he needed to win the state. This was that infamous phone call where Trump said, all I need you to do is find, you know, the number of votes I need to win Georgia. So Raffensperger was censured. He was primaried. He was stripped of his power as chief election officer. What's he doing now? Does he still have a position? GELLMAN: Brad Raffensperger is still secretary of state. He is running for reelection. A Trump-backed candidate is opposing him in the Republican primary. This Trump-backed candidate says that Raffensperger should not have certified Biden's victory, even though there were three full counts made of the vote - two audits and one original count. So Trump is trying to install - and the state Republican Party is trying to install - a more pliant secretary of state in his place. Meanwhile, for good measure, the state Legislature has removed Raffensperger as a voting member of the state election board. So if Raffensperger is reelected, the next election, he will not have oversight of the election certification. He won't be one of the people who votes to decide on the election certification. And not only that, but the state Legislature has given itself power to fire the county election officials - with special reference to Fulton County, where Atlanta is and where the Democrats are - so that Raffensperger no longer certifies the vote. The state election authority, appointed entirely by the Republican legislature, has more power, and they can fire the county election authorities in Democratic counties if they want and put in someone else. This is the way they're changing the rules so they get to decide who wins. GROSS: My guest is Barton Gellman. His new article in The Atlantic is titled \"Trump's Next Coup Has Already Begun: January 6 Was Practice.\" We'll be right back after a short break. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF STEVE REICH'S \"MALLET QUARTET I. FAST\") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Let's get back to my interview with Barton Gellman. He's a staff writer at The Atlantic. His new article is titled \"Trump's Next Coup Has Already Begun.\" And it's in part about how January 6 was just practice. He warns that we face a serious risk that American democracy as we know it will come to an end in 2024. He says the attempt by Trump and other Republicans to overturn the results of the 2020 election failed. But Republicans have been building an apparatus for election theft, finding ways they hope to avoid all the obstacles that stood in the way of subverting the results of the 2020 election. The infrastructure of elections is being changed in many states. And it's happening quickly. It's happening beneath the radar for many people. Not everybody's paying attention to this. And then it remains in place, right? I mean, it's - what are the odds that these changes will just kind of stay in place and that the whole nature of elections is going to change for a really long time? GELLMAN: A healthy democracy needs fair referees and counts on the idea that fundamentals of things like counting votes can be done reliably by nonpartisan officials. That's the tradition. That's what distinguishes elections in a place like the United States or in Western Europe from elections in countries where, you know, the results are fixed. And that's changing right now in front of our eyes. And because these seem like small, tactical, bureaucratic changes, they're not arousing the interests of the public. And they're not rousing protectors of democracy to regard this as an urgent problem. And this is, I believe, a democratic emergency, and that without very strong and systematic pushback from protectors of democracy, we're going to lose something that we can't afford to lose about the way we run elections. GROSS: And what you're describing, I mean, it's happening in a significant number of states. You say, in at least 15 states, Republicans have advanced new laws to shift authority over elections from governors and career officials in the executive branch to the state legislature. And that 15 states is a lot of states. And I assume this includes swing states because those are the states that really count in the plan, right? GELLMAN: Yeah. I mean, it's a strange thing that the ideology of Trumpism - that the last election was marked by systematic fraud, which it was not - is so widespread now that even in states that Trump won, they're calling for audits of the vote (laughter) and claiming that Democrats committed fraud. Although, why they would commit fraud in order to lose the state is left mysterious. But, yeah, there are some Democratic states and some Republican states where these changes are being made. And they're driven by a highly passionate and motivated base of voters who genuinely believe the election was stolen last time. They have fallen victim to this systematic propaganda that was put out by - first and foremost by Trump, but by a whole ecosystem of right-wing amplifiers. GROSS: Do you think the strategy by Trump supporters to recount votes even when Republicans won is to just normalize the idea of, no, we do recounts, that's what we do? GELLMAN: It's really to normalize the idea that the system can't be trusted, that the election system is riving by fraud, that nothing is trustworthy and that voters shouldn't trust the administration of elections. I mean, it is so profoundly damaging to civil society, to the whole idea of a democratic republic - that you can't trust the institutions that count the votes. But that is the fundamental message that Trump has been sending since well before the last election. GROSS: So in terms of who oversees the elections, we've talked about the state legislature. We've talked a little bit about secretaries of state who have been undermined. Nonpartisan election officials at local levels have been driven out by fear because they've been attacked, they've been threatened by Trump supporters. So - like, that's another big change that we're facing. So for the people who are being, like, chased out with threats to their safety, who are they being replaced with? GELLMAN: Well, this is hard to follow because there are, I want to say, on the order of 10,000 election authorities in the United States, most commonly at the county level. And then there are the precinct level. And they are resigning in droves. I mean, their voicemails and their emails are filled with hatred and scary attacks and people telling them that they're going to be executed in public, that they should fear for the safety of their families and their children. And they're saying, I didn't sign up for this. I'm just a volunteer who wanted to perform my civic duty. But this is too much for me. And there are grassroots efforts, well-funded by Republicans, to replace these people with true believers in the big lie and true believers in the sort of cult of Trump in the Republican Party. GROSS: They are going from the ground up. Well, let's take another break here. If you're just joining us, my guest is Barton Gellman. His new article in The Atlantic is titled \"Trump's Next Coup Has Already Begun.\" We'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF AVISHAI COHEN'S \"GBEDE TEMIN\") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to my interview with Barton Gellman. His new article in The Atlantic is titled \"Trump's Next Coup Has Already Begun.\" Gellman is a staff writer at The Atlantic. You think President Biden isn't taking the threat of election subversion seriously enough. What would you like to see him do? What could he do? GELLMAN: It's a hard problem. What I know is that it's going to require hard effort. Biden gave a speech in July. He went to the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia and stood underneath a gigantic reproduction of the preamble to the Constitution, and he said that the election subversion that we've been talking about today, Terry, is the greatest challenge to democracy since the Civil War. Now, when a president of the United States says that something is the greatest challenge to democracy since the Civil War, you would expect him to spring into action. You would expect him to make it one of his highest, if not his very highest, priority and to bring to bear all of his authority and power to do something about it. Now, presidents have a lot to do. He has big problems to address. He has COVID and climate and the economy and a giant social spending and infrastructure bill. And even so, he is acting as if it's business as usual on the democracy side. And democracy is very much under threat. I think the president himself knows what it looks like when he says, I'm going to make this my top priority. Clear my schedule. Let's figure out how we address this. And grassroots organizers who are in support of democratic institutions could be doing what the Republicans are doing at the precinct and the county and the state level in terms of organizing to control election authorities to ensure that they remain nonpartisan or neutral. And news media, frankly, could be putting a lot more attention on this. You're getting some great reporting on the local election changes in places like ProPublica and The Washington Post. Nevertheless, they are not sort of sustained war-footing news coverage that says democracy is under threat. GROSS: You write that Trump has built the first American mass political movement that's ready to fight by any means necessary, including bloodshed, for its cause, and its cause is Trump. So I guess, you know, January 6 is evidence of that, but you say the extremists who support him and many of the extremists who are at the insurrection and broke into - you know, who rioted and broke into the Capitol, they don't follow the usual demographic patterns for those kinds of extremists who are willing to use violence. In what ways don't they fit the pattern of demographics? GELLMAN: That's a great question. One way we know that this Trump political movement is different is by looking at who the January 6 rioters were. If you look at people who are charged with political violence in the past, they were almost always in their 20s or early 30s. The January 6 insurgents have a mean age of 42. That is wildly out of the usual pattern. In the past, you would see very high unemployment rates for those charged with political violence. This time you are seeing unemployment rates that match the population at large. The Trump insurgents, the January 6 insurgents, were well-employed. They were middle class. They were white collar. They were managers. They were public officials. They were active and retired members of the military, of police departments. They in no way match the demographic profile of politically violent actors in the past. They are also not primarily members of radical extremist groups, like the Proud Boys or the Oath Keepers or the Three Percenter militias. There were several dozen of those militia-type members in the group of those arrested. But 6 out of 7 of the January 6 insurgents had no affiliation at all. Robert Pape at the University of Chicago has done very good work on this and. And he - based on the characteristics of the January 6 insurgents, he commissioned a series of national polls that were designed to find how many people share those essential characteristics, and the way he did that was he looked for people who agreed with two very strong statements. One is that the election was stolen, and Biden is an illegitimate president. The other is that violence is justified in order to restore Trump to the presidency. And he found that there were 8% of Americans - 8%; it's a relatively small number, but it represents about 21 million adult Americans - believe that violence is justified to restore Trump to the presidency. And the only other common belief that the great majority of them shared was that whites are in danger of being replaced by minorities in this country. And that is a well-worn white supremacist belief that's being reinforced by Trump and by many of his big amplifiers in the media, notably among them Tucker Carlson on Fox News, that whites have to worry about being replaced by Black and brown people. And so if you correlate the January 6 insurgents with county data, you find that they are much more likely to come from counties in which the proportion of the white population is in decline. The more it is that the white population is shrinking in a county, the more likely it is that that county sent an insurgent to Washington on January 6. GROSS: We've spent a lot of time talking about how Republicans are trying to change the electoral system to their advantage, and Trump has so much to do with this. It's fascinating to me because Trump basically knew so little about politics. He wasn't - like, Biden has been - you know, had been in Congress for so long. He knew how Congress works. He knew - he knows how to get votes. He knows how to count votes. Trump knew none of this, and yet he is reshaping the American political system. He is reshaping the American electoral system. And I keep wondering, how has he managed to do that knowing so little about how the system works? GELLMAN: He still knows very little about how the system works. And he's not the mastermind of all these changes, he's the motivator. He has created this mass movement of very angry people. And I just have to remind you that a catastrophic number of Republicans believe the election was actually stolen. And again, this is a baseless belief. But 68% of all Republicans - not just the ones who are amenable to violence, 68% believe the election was stolen. And they are angry about it. And Trump has built this angry base. And this angry base is driving politicians at all levels to smite every obstacle in the way of Trump winning. And so every place that stood up to Trump and said, no, well, this is what the vote was, we're not going to change the vote, has been assaulted either by Trump directly or by his supporters. And you then have professional operatives who are motivated by the same forces, who believe their own political futures depend on pleasing this angry base who are looking for all the loopholes in the rules. GROSS: You've been reporting on politics and power for many years now, including during the George W. Bush administration. Do you see your approach to journalism changing in an era where you're facing lies that have accumulated a lot of strength, where, like, millions and millions of people believe things that aren't true and are changing America with those false beliefs, with those counterfactual beliefs? GELLMAN: Yeah. There has been a change. You're accustomed, as a mainstream journalist, to not taking sides in a political dispute and not being for or against any political party. But what we're for as journalists is truth. And what we're for as journalists is democracy. We are unambiguously in favor of our democratic system and of allowing the people to choose their own leaders. And the conundrum is that right now we have a political party that is bowing to authoritarian forces, that is systematically lying about the political process, about the election process itself. And so we're not - I'm not trying to advance the interests of the Democratic Party in my reporting. But we have only one party right now that is small-D democratic. We have only one party that is prepared to lose a legitimate election and another one that's prepared to win by sacrificing the essential elements of democracy. And so I am calling out the mainstream of the Republican Party for its lies and for its election subversion in a way that tonally is different from what I could have imagined writing 10 or 20 years ago. GROSS: Bart Gellman, thank you so much for talking with us. And thank you for your reporting. GELLMAN: Thank you for having me.

Of all the disruptions unleashed by the Trump White House on how the federal government typically works, the saga of one small project, called the Open Technology Fund, stands out. The fantastical tale incorporates the spiritual movement Falun Gong, former White House strategist Steve Bannon, the daughter of a late liberal congressman and a zealous appointee of former President Donald Trump. And specifically, it involves a fierce, months-long battle over whether the U.S. Agency for Global Media and the U.S. State Department should subsidize software developed by adherents of Falun Gong that auditors found wanting. The decision to prioritize this software stripped money intended for critical apps from a federal fund designed to bolster technology vital to dissidents overseas, officials say. On top of that, once the software was approved for funding, a grand total of four people abroad used it to access Voice of America and Radio Free Asia, a key purpose for its subsidy. That's right, four. The whole fight was, in short, bananas. Yet the consequences were serious. Executives lost their jobs. The U.S. government froze nearly $20 million in funds for other tech projects that helped democracy advocates evade authoritarian regimes. \"Any time a journalist or human rights defender \u2014 whether they're in China or Iran or Russia \u2014 picks up one of our technologies, we know and they know that they are being protected as best as they possibly can,\" says Laura Cunningham, who was fired as president of the Open Technology Fund under Trump and then restored to her position. \"To push OTF to reduce those standards around security and effectiveness? It's not just watering down or pushing aside laws and regulations. It is literally putting people's lives in jeopardy.\" The State Department's inspector general has been investigating a whistleblower's allegations \u2014 first being made public by NPR in this story \u2014 that the concerted effort to divert funds to the Falun Gong software Ultrasurf was a criminal conspiracy. The pressure campaign begins There is a technology arms race between repressive governments seeking to clamp down on free expression and people seeking to evade such restrictions without leaving fingerprints. Adherents of Falun Gong first developed Ultrasurf nearly two decades ago to get around censors in China and elsewhere. Early on, Ultrasurf seemed a highly promising tool in aiding activists and journalists to talk securely online. It earlier received development money from the State Department and the predecessor agency to USAGM. In the U.S., Falun Gong practitioners have put on colorful cultural festivals and mass meditations. They've also proselytized its beliefs, which largely focus on the powers of meditation but can be extreme. Some teachings condemn homosexuality, alcohol, smoking and sex outside marriage. Chinese authorities first banned Falun Gong more than two decades ago. They have called it a cult and sought to restrict its influence in other countries; advocacy groups such as Freedom House and Human Rights Watch have documented the persecution. The group's profile rose sharply in the U.S. during the Trump era. People with close ties to Falun Gong own The Epoch Times, which has promoted pro-Trump conspiracy theories in its pages and in videos posted to Facebook and YouTube. Falun Gong provided ballast for Trump's rhetoric against China. Yet its Ultrasurf software appealed to some advocates on the left and right. Among the strongest proponents for federal funding are Katrina Lantos Swett, the daughter of the late Rep. Tom Lantos, a liberal Democrat, and conservative activist Michael Horowitz, the former director of the Project for International Religious Liberty at the right-of-center Hudson Institute. Swett serves as the head of the human rights foundation named after her father, who survived the Holocaust as a child and went on to represent California in the House, leading the House Foreign Affairs Committee in his final years. She has run unsuccessfully several times in Democratic primaries for federal office in New Hampshire. In October 2019, Swett argued that Congress should require the U.S. Agency for Global Media to devote $25 million to so-called firewall-circumvention technology. \"The United States has a momentous opportunity to send a strong message condemning censorship and digital authoritarianism by supporting proven large-scale circumvention tools,\" Swett wrote in the fall of 2019. \"With clear Congressional leadership and direction, we hope that the new leadership at the USAGM will again engage in funding long proven tools that can provide Internet access to millions of users in closed societies every day.\" Among the few software platforms she cited: Ultrasurf. Ultrasurf's secrecy made fund officials wary Programs with similar ambitions have been funded through the Open Technology Fund. The fund originally sat under USAGM as a division of Radio Free Asia. In September 2019, it was spun off with the blessing of a senior Trump budget official and key lawmakers. It is now an independent nonprofit organization yet remains wholly dependent on the U.S. government for funding. The fund helped incubate the development of Tor technology, the secure-messaging platform Signal and the tech that undergirds Facebook, Skype and WhatsApp. It seeks to aid private communications. And these platforms also enable people to surreptitiously consume news coverage and programs from the international broadcasters under USAGM, including Radio Free Asia and Voice of America. The tools are particularly important in such countries as Russia, China, Iran and Cuba. And they have served to protect protest organizers in Belarus, Hong Kong and Myanmar in the middle of brutal government crackdowns. One problem for Ultrasurf: OTF predominantly subsidizes the development and distribution of software code that is considered open source. Among other things, that means it can be reviewed by outside software engineers to determine if there are either unintended vulnerabilities or intentional back doors that would allow hostile regimes in. Ultrasurf was closed code. And its creators and owners had fought repeatedly against lifting the veil. Regardless, its champions dug in. Swett had an ally in Trump's pick to lead USAGM: Michael Pack, a conservative documentarian whose nomination had languished for nearly two years in the Senate until the spring of 2020. \"Very close to Michael Pack\" In mid-March of last year, Pack's nomination started to gain momentum. Swett called Libby Liu and Laura Cunningham, then the Open Technology Fund's CEO and president, respectively. With an aide on the line, Swett demanded that they fund Ultrasurf. She boasted that she was \"very close to Michael Pack and his sherpa,\" according to contemporaneous notes of the call obtained by NPR. (The aides assigned to help presidential appointees through the nomination process are often called Sherpas.) The two OTF executives noted that Ultrasurf's backers had never applied to receive any money from the fund through a competitive process, a process required by law. They said they welcomed a submission. None came. Six weeks later, Swett published a piece in The Hill castigating USAGM and OTF: \"Unfortunately, they have withheld sufficient funding from these technologies for nearly a decade,\" she wrote. Swett declined NPR's request for comment. A spokeswoman said the foundation supported an \"all hands on deck\" approach and saw the agency as an ally, even if they disagreed on strategy. Pack's prospects had accelerated once the White House launched an attack on the Voice of America for its coverage of the coronavirus outbreak in China. Bannon, who had advised Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign and in the White House, told The Washington Post he had pushed for Pack because VOA and its sister networks should be \"on point\" with Trump's foreign policy, especially his hard-line tack against the Chinese communist regime. \"He's my guy,\" Bannon said of Pack, with whom he had worked on two documentaries years earlier. He told Vox, \"Pack's over there to clean house.\" In early June, as the Senate confirmed Pack, USAGM senior staffer Joan Mower called an employee at the State Department to flag concerns about the OTF, saying it was \"created illegally\" and \"wasn't funding the important tools, like Ultrasurf,\" according to a contemporaneous account shared by the State Department employee with colleagues. She also warned that Liu's tenure would be cut short and that the Trump White House wouldn't allow the fund to pay for the programs it intended to subsidize. (NPR reviewed the contemporaneous account and spoke with four people who said they heard of it at the time. Mower says she doesn't recall that conversation.) On June 13, Michael Horowitz took to Bannon's online radio show to demand Pack dump Liu: \"He's got to fire her! Quickly!\" Liu announced in a letter that she would be stepping down, effective in July, seeking, as she later put it to NPR, \"to deflect heat\" from other executives. It didn't work. Pack fired Liu, Cunningham and the chiefs of Radio Free Europe, Radio Free Asia and the rest, along with a senior adviser, Steve Capus, who is a former president of NBC News. (VOA's top two officials resigned as Pack was taking office.) Veteran staffers sidelined in push for Ultrasurf funding And the push for Ultrasurf funding proved relentless. Pack sidelined and suspended a cadre of top USAGM executives, accusing them of grave lapses. Among them were the general counsel, the chief strategy officer and the chief financial officer, who had warned him it could be illegal to divert money to Ultrasurf without going through proper application and review processes. (Pack has not responded to NPR's requests for comment for this and related stories.) In late June, Andr\u00e9 Mendes, appointed by Pack as the agency's chief operating officer, took part in a meeting at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, right next to the White House. According to the whistleblower complaint by a State Department staffer, Mendes brought up old battles over Ultrasurf. He told the various national security officials present that the State Department had not continued funding Ultrasurf because it did not want to offend Chinese officials, given its roots in Falun Gong. Mendes then said, according to the whistleblower complaint, that USAGM had \"gotten rid of some people\" and that decisions on which Internet freedom initiatives would be funded would be made \"less ideologically.\" He made the case that religious groups needed to play a greater role, according to the whistleblower, clearly referring to Ultrasurf. NPR obtained the complaint from a congressional source and verified it with the whistleblower's attorney. Mendes rejects this account. \"Those statements are inaccurate and misquote me,\" Mendes wrote to NPR. \"The Lantos [F]oundation understood the dynamics of the lack of pragmatism on the part of the people that fought so hard to defund [Ultrasurf] despite its success. Alas, they were smeared by that machine.\" An audit affirms doubts The State Department also funds digital efforts to circumvent the \"Great Firewall of China\" and other authoritarian efforts to clamp down on free speech. An initial security audit of Ultrasurf commissioned by the State Department, however, reflected significant problems with the software, which was still relying on technologies that were considered cutting edge in 2013. The audit, conducted late last spring and reviewed by NPR, concluded that \"censoring Ultrasurf nation-wide would have been trivial for a moderate-budget adversary.\" It said a \"complete and fundamental redesign\" would be needed to guarantee that hostile forces could not readily shut it down. Robert Destro, assistant secretary of state for democracy, human rights and labor under Trump, says he was aware of the audit. Nonetheless, he says, people in the field in the Middle East and Asia told him Ultrasurf was effective. \"I don't know what the empirical [value of the software] is,\" Destro tells NPR. \"Was I supportive of the Falun Gong? Was I supportive of Ultrasurf? Yeah. But that wasn't my job. My job was to oversee Internet freedom, and if they fit into them, that's great.\" Later on, the Lantos Foundation's Swett emailed to ask Destro pointed questions about the Ultrasurf audit, though none of it was public, according to email exchanges attached to the whistleblower complaint. Destro then asked several colleagues to find out where the problems were so they could \"cut the knot.\" The whistleblower charges that this was an inappropriate intervention from a senior State Department official in the formal evaluation of whether Ultrasurf should qualify to receive federal funds. \"What we've seen with the treatment of Ultrasurf over the last year really is pretty shocking,\" says Whistleblower Aid founder John Tye, who represents the official. \"It's an effort by lobbyists with close ties to the Trump administration to really reroute human rights funding and policy away from proven technologies ... toward tools that really just check a box in terms of close ties to religious movements.\" Former U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who left office with Trump, made funding religious groups a hallmark of his tenure. He declined a request for comment for this story. Destro tells NPR he simply wanted to make sure everyone had trust in the process. \"Why is there so much thunder and lightning about Ultrasurf?\" Destro asks. \"It was always very curious. What was this fight about? And to be honest with you, some of it, I think, has to do with the fact that it came out of the Falun Gong movement.\" Upheaval at the Open Technology Fund under Pack In July, Pack announced he would appoint a new chief for the Open Technology Fund, James Miles. Miles, a Republican lawyer who had served as South Carolina's secretary of state, had no experience in Internet freedom and had been accused by the Federal Trade Commission of participating in \"an allegedly illegal pyramid scheme.\" He had, however, issued an official \"Certificate of Appreciation\" to Falun Gong while in office in South Carolina, according to a reproduction of the certificate on a website run by the spiritual movement. Miles did not respond to NPR's message to his private email account seeking comment. A federal appeals court ruled later that month that Pack had overstepped his authority in dismissing and replacing OTF's corporate board, which had to approve the dismissals of Liu and Cunningham. As Liu had resigned, Cunningham was restored to run the operation. Pack moved Miles to a revived Office of Internet Freedom within the CEO's office at USAGM. Late that month, Pack gave an interview to an Epoch Times reporter, who asked him about Ultrasurf. \"China's internet firewall is like the Berlin Wall: It has to come down,\" Pack told the paper, which said Pack did not specify what tools he sought to use. Behind the scenes, however, Pack sought to move funds toward Ultrasurf. In August, the agency's deputy chief financial officer resigned rather than approve directing money to the program. And the Open Technology Fund found itself stymied. Pack would ultimately tie up more than $19 million. He took over more than 80% of the activity subsidized by the fund and additional money from Radio Free Asia. And he had USAGM pay a powerful Richmond, Va., law firm with strong Republican ties more than $1 million to investigate the executives he sought to fire as well as OTF's activities. Dissidents in Danger A PBS NewsHour report compiled some examples of the harm done. \"I have had to distance myself from my family quite a bit to increase their safety,\" Iranian-born democracy activist Nima Fatemi told NewsHour. His non-profit organization, Kandoo, helps to devise ways to protect the cybersecurity of Iranian protesters from the regime. It lost its funding from OTF after Pack took control. \"Secure communication is the step zero of any change in any society,\" he said. In October, a D.C. Superior Court judge found that Pack had overstepped his bounds. Still, under Pack, USAGM awarded Ultrasurf $1.8 million but paid out only $249,000 late in the year. Officials say that this was because that was the only money his aides could flush out for it. By then, Joe Biden had won the presidential election. And Pack was fighting a rearguard action, aware that Biden would want to replace him. In mid-December, Pack moved to \"debar\" the Open Technology Fund, which would block it from receiving funds not only from the U.S. Agency for Global Media but also from any other arm of the federal government for three years. Two days before Biden's inauguration, Pack moved to appoint new board members for the networks his agency oversees. Among the appointees: writer Roger L. Simon, who is a columnist for The Epoch Times. Just days earlier, Simon wrote that he believed the Jan. 6 siege of Capitol Hill, inspired by then-President Trump, was a \"false flag operation\" by forces seeking to discredit Trump. Just hours after Biden took the oath of office, Pack resigned at the new president's behest. The new administration invited most of the officials who were dismissed or suspended by Pack back to the agency and dismissed many of his appointees. New USAGM officials have promised to restore funding to OTF. During his nearly eight months in office, Pack reserved nearly all of his media interviews for friendly conservative or right-leaning outfits. One of his final ones, in late December, was a video interview with The Epoch Times. Once again, The Epoch Times interviewer asked about Ultrasurf. \"I find it odd that they weren't funded,\" Pack said. \"This spin-off agency of ours, a separate grantee called the Open Technology Fund, in its very name, they are self-limiting. I can't figure it out.\" \"There's no reason not to fund it.\" As of late last year, Pack and other former USAGM officials were facing a formal criminal inquiry over the whole issue \u2014 the Open Technology Fund, Ultrasurf, the firings, all of it. On Wednesday, a powerful senior Democratic senator, Ron Wyden of Oregon, sent a letter pressing the inspector general's office on its findings. (Former OTF CEO Libby Liu filed her own whistleblower complaint in September.) The State Department whistleblower's attorneys asked the Justice Department to open a formal criminal inquiry as well. And the new leadership at USAGM has also referred Pack's related actions to the inspector general. In February, an official with Voice of America sought to see how useful Ultrasurf had proved during the period it was supported by the agency. He ran a review to see how many people used Ultrasurf to access Voice of America's and Radio Free Asia's services, one of the reasons OTF subsidizes such software. Two people did in December; another two did in January. \"We spent nearly two weeks checking and double-checking how the number could possibly be this low,\" Matthew Baise, the director of digital strategy and audience development for Voice of America, wrote in an email to his bosses on Feb. 19 that was obtained by NPR. \"We believe the true, final number of measurable traffic from Ultrasurf to be so miniscule because a) none of the networks were ever notified of its existence so it was never promoted b) it's only available for Windows desktop machines (almost all our audience is on mobile devices) and c) it is a brand new product,\" Baise wrote. \"In the absence of promotion on Ultrasurf's end, this thing was essentially invisible.\" Disclosure: This story was reported by NPR media correspondent David Folkenflik and edited by NPR media and technology editor Emily Kopp. Because of NPR CEO John Lansing's prior role as CEO of the U.S. Agency for Global Media, no senior news executive or corporate executive at NPR reviewed this story before it was published.",
